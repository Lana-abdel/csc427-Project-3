430842	1173088	116654	1.0	Unwatchable .	How bad is the 1996 remake " The Island of Dr . Moreau " ? Unwatchably bad . That's how bad it is . I like Val Kilmer ( " Heat , " " Top Secret !

429209	1173088	120737	1.0	Good , but not the best ever .	I'm not exactly sure how this got number 1 on the top 250 on IMDB , I liked it but I wouldn't say it's the best movie ever . It was a good remake of the books , even if they did leave out Tom Bombadil and the whole forest chapter . That always happens when they bring movies to the big screen . But Peter Jackson did a good job of bringing Middlearth to life . The cast was great , especially Ian McKellen as Gandalf the wizard . With outstanding special effects and scenery , Lord of the Rings : The Fellowship of the Ring , is not only nice to look at , but also to get involved in . Although it was 3 hrs . long and a bit slow paced towards some scenes , that's what I'd expect from a remake off a book like TLOTR trilogy . 3 and a half / 5 stars
430333	1173088	299712	1.0	One of the worst films I've ever seen - not even Mickey can save it	I watched this on TV because the digital cable guide listed it as a film " starring Mickey Rourke . " Little did I know all he had was a very brief cameo in the film , yet it was enough for them to advertise his name all over the listings . In fact it actually stars a Tom Cruise lookalike named Daniel Cosgrove who suspects little bugs ( cockroaches and that sort ) are planning to take over the world . The film is shot in a gritty , blue-filtered way - like those TV cop shows ( Law & Order , NYPD Blue , The Shield , etc . ) but the problem is that the " reality " feel of the movie betrays its utter absurdity - - please , LITTLE BUGS ATTACKING THE WORLD ? ! What is this - - the 1950s ? ! The worst scene has to be the very ending ( SPOILER AHEAD ) when all the little bugs " form together " to create one giant , enormous " bug " that attempts to kill the hero . The way he " kills " it is laughable at best . It's not worth watching - not even for Mickey .
430062	1173088	95897	1.0	You know how you've heard this movie is really bad ? Well , whoever told you that is RIGHT . . .	" 48 Hours " - - two mismatched cops . " Red Heat " - - two mismatched cops . " Lethal Weapon " - - two mismatched cops . Do we really need any more entries into this genre ? No . But at least the preceeding films had either a level of wit or chemistry - - perhaps both - - that made them quality entertainment . " The Presidio , " a cop-buddy film with Sean Connery and Mark Harmon , is nothing special at all . It's routine and boring , and if that wets your lips then dig in . Mark Harmon plays a Chicago cop brought in to investigate the murder of a fellow officer of the law . Sean Connery is his Scottish partner , a hard-nosed fellow with an attractive daughter ( played by Meg Ryan ) who takes a liking to Harmon ( by matter of script cliches ) . They hit it off much to the chagrin of her father , who continues to be paired with the young American . They end up in the usual car chases and on-foot pursuits . Action purses around just about every corner . There's a chase where Harmon is leaping over the hoods of cars and Sean Connery is dragging behind , looking very much out of breath and tired . But this is a boring film - - one that put me to sleep in the first minute and , from the looks of it , many other people , too . Connery tries hard to fight against the material , but Harmon is the film's primary flaw - - he's like Kevin Costner on sleeping medication . Meg Ryan is the typical sweet Girl Next Door love interest , but she would display much more acting skills in the next year's " When Harry Met Sally " with Billy Crystal . The script leaps all logic . It's as bleak , dry and typical as a film in this genre can get . I expected a nice source of entertainment in this film . It not only does not entertain , it literally repulses the viewer . Sean Connery and Mark Harmon have no chemistry on-screen . They pretty much just run about screaming at each other . Sean Connery has the Straight Man role that Arnold Schwarzenegger , Danny Glover and Nick Nolte have all played before . Which leaves room for the Comic Loose Man . But Harmon isn't a comical guy , and he isn't as loose as he is just plain ignorant . This is a poor example of buddies . The movie was directed by Peter Hyams , who obviously needs a lesson in how to properly construct a fast-paced and engaging cop-buddy film . This movie suffers from lack of pace and lack of solid direction - - one of its biggest flaws apart from casting decisions . Not only that , but the writer , Larry Ferguson , needs to take some lessons in how to cross the boundaries of a regular script and breathe into his characters life . There's a difference between written characters and typed characters . His are in the latter category . The movie is 97 minutes long and it feels two times longer . I recently saw a buddy flick called " Hollywood Homicide " with Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett . Even that film was better than this - - and " Hollywood " is making my list of the worst films of 2003 . Only really big fans of Sean Connery should venture near this . And the fans of Mark Harmon should all be taken out to a field and shot . stars . - John Ulmer
429159	1173088	307479	1.0	James Cameron was originally going to write and direct this film , instead of produce it . He should have .	I don't think anyone can say that Steven Soderbergh hasn't broadened his range of directorial efforts . We've had horror ( " Out of Sight " ) , drama ( " Erin Brockovich " ) , gritty realism ( " Traffic " ) , comedy ( " Ocean's Eleven " ) , and now romance in " Solaris , " a film that blew me out of the water - in terms of I was so surprised it sucked . I think this may be the very first film that Steven Soderbergh made that is bad - followed by that stinky " Collinwood " movie . It is a nod towards Stanley Kubrick , but most of the film - especially sequences like the docking ship - just seem like hopeless rip-offs . James Cameron was originally going to write and direct this film , but then Soderbergh jumped on board so Cameron produced it . I wish they had let him write and direct it . Not only would it have been much more . . . hmm . . . how should I put it . . . INTERESTING , it would also be about ten times more meaningful than this sorry mess . The film ( based upon a novel and previous film titled " Solaryis " ) takes place sometime in the future , when a pshrink named Chris Klein ( George Clooney ) is sent to a space station on the planet Solaris to rescue a crew of space explorers . Once there , he realizes why no one wants to leave . Chris ' dead wife comes back to him in the space station - she looks real , she feels real , she acts real - but she is undoubtedly an image from his memory , extracted by the mysterious planet . Soon he realizes that he cannot take her back to earth , and he must cope with the fact that she must be destroyed . But she seems so real he refuses to do so . Oh my , the suspense , the suspense . What an intriguing idea we have , completely wasted with an incompetent script and style of direction . The characters act weird throughout . For example , when Chris first arrives at the space station and finds people dead , he also finds a survivor named Snow . Chris doesn't seem to ask many questions . He asks what happened , and the Snow character ( who is also very weird ) doesn't answer correctly . Chris just kind of walks away , and finds another survivor . Once again , he gets no answers . So what does he do ? He goes to sleep . Everyone in this movie just acts weird . I can't describe it in words - they just don't act right . Even the humans . This may very well be George Clooney's most washed-out performance to date . And the actor who played Snow , Jeremy Davies , is one of the worst actors I have ever seen . He plays the exact same characters ( notice the similarities to his character in " The Million Dollar Hotel " to his character in " Solaris " ) . In fact , " Solaris " is a lot like " The Million Dollar Hotel . " I hated that movie with a personal vengeance . On the DVD commentary track for " Solaris , " James Cameron said , " If I had made it there would be a lot more car chases , more gunfights . " Quite honestly , I wish there were . Cameron would have made this film interesting , with or without violence and extravagant special effects , even . Soderbergh simply makes a melodramatic snoozer that is as boring as it is odd and ridiculous . stars - John Ulmer
429657	1173088	120157	1.0	If this movie were a person I would kill him .	I'm not a Paul W . S . Anderson basher - that is , I think he's a generally poor director but I don't devote my life to criticizing him endlessly on Internet message boards - and I think he's at least handled the visual aspects of most of his movies quite well ( hate it or not , " AvP " - which I didn't care for - was atmospherically in-touch with the other movies , and " Event Horizon " felt like an " Alien " sequel itself ) . But really . This movie is absolutely terrible . It's easily Paul's worst movie , which is saying quite a lot . I'm even a decent fan of Kurt Russell so for me to say his performance sucks beyond belief here would be like a Jim Carrey fan admitting Carrey is too over the top in his earlier comedies - it's not going to happen . The movie basically rips off every futuristic / apocalyptic action movie you can think of , including " Alien , " " Blade Runner , " " The Terminator " and of course Kurt's " Escape from New York . " The problem is there's no substance here . The direction is slipshod and lazy - the action scenes are boring and none of the characters stand out at all . The hero is a dull , emotionless waste of space who has one facial expression preserved throughout the movie : The Kurt Russell " Cold Stare . " ( tm ) You'll know what I mean if you've seen a Kurt Russell movie before . Anyway , if you're a Paul basher then you'll hate this . If you're not a Paul basher you'll still hate it . I don't have a problem with simplistic action movies - but at least make them ENTERTAINING ! I was dead bored watching this .
430454	1173088	826254	1.0	Possibly the worst new TV show on air .	It's never very promising when advertising campaigns for upcoming television shows have to constantly remind us of how unoriginal the program is by endlessly comparing it to other popular shows . " 10 Items or Less " was promoted , in fact , with the following slogan : " If you thought working in an office was funny , wait until you see what it's like to work in a CONVENIENCE STORE ! ! " Oh , wow ! Brilliant ! Let's rip-off a television show which is already a remake of another international television show from Britain ! Awesome ! High fives TBS execs ! You really nailed it on the head this time ! I mean , after a string of flop original TV shows I imagine they must have all been sitting in their meeting with a collective frown trying to figure out how to ( finally ) achieve success . " How about we make a fake documentary show . . . and put it in an office ? " - " Hasn't that already been done ? " - " Oh , yeah , right . " ( Pause ) - " I know ! Let's put it in a CONVENIENCE store ! " - " Yes ! Brilliant idea ! " - " High fives all around ! " Not only are the characters flat , uninteresting and virtually _ all _ rip-offs of characters from The Office ( including Leslie , who is a painfully unfunny Steve Carrell / Andy Gervais wannabe ) - their second episode DIRECTLY STEALS from an episode of the TV show " It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia " ! It's not just a casual similarity , either . The episode of Sunny featured the owners of a bar trying to exploit a water stain on the wall of their establishment which resembles Jesus . The new episode of " 10 Items " ( which premieres in 15 minutes ) features the EXACT same plot line ! I struggled through the first episode trying to understand just how on earth such a desperate show could ever be greenlit . This is the stuff of film parody . There are the stereotypes of dumb executives trying to constantly cash in on successful fads - but this is almost TOO outrageous to be real ! It's a lame-brain copycat right down to its very directorial style and plot lines . The debut was one of the worst TV show debuts I've ever seen . Premieres are never fantastic in most cases but this was agonizing to sit through . This show will disappear very soon , and I hope everyone involved never has a chance to work again . Why ? Well , because I'm a rather evil person who will no doubt find great delight in watching this pack of moronic actors have little-to-no success in the future . Good luck , guys !
430852	1173088	60666	1.0	If you don't like this film , you're probably just stupid and ignorant .	This is the very best film ever made . The direction of Hal Warren is amazing , and ranks at the top with other grand master visualists such as Kurosawa , Fellini , Bergman , Truffaut , Scorsese , Kubrick , Michael Bay and McG . The acting is compelling . John Reynolds perfectly embodies the deformed " Torgo . " Hal Warren display similarly impressive skills in _ front _ of the camera as Michael , the dense man who , after being told " The Master will not be happy " about his family's presence at a creepy old mansion run by a weirdo who can barely walk , tells his wife she is " imagining things " when Torgo tells her that the Master likes her , and is dead , but not dead the way they are familiar with . The screenplay is superb . Realistic dialogue flows like cheap champagne at one of Paris Hilton's parties . I also particularly loved the Bergman-style shots of nothing-ness - - for example , the opening , which is a ten minute montage of mid-west scenery . Kubrick would be jealous . I also loved how all the conversation takes place through facial expressions . When Michael and Normal American Family first meet Torgo , no exchange of dialogue takes place for over thirty seconds . At first , I thought it was just due to Hal Warren being a totally incompetent director with very poor editing skills . But later , I realized it was all in the gestures of Torgo's face , as he stares at them with icy emotion . He's translating a message : " I'm here , I'm Torgo , I'm sad and lonely . " What a beautiful , poetic and truly moving scene . It made me cry , Warren has transcended the genre here - this ranks in the top class of all films of the past century - forget " Citizen Kane , " forget " Seven Samurai , " forget " Pearl Harbor . " This is the best movie ever made , and if you disagree , you're probably just stupid and ignorant .
430259	1173088	146402	1.0	A HORRIBLE 2nd sequel	The Addams Family came out in 91 , and it was a huge hit . Then the sequel came out 2 years later in 93 , also being a hit . Now number 3 is out , the Addams Family Reunion , a horrribly stupid bad acted ( except for Tim Curry and Daryl Hannah ) movie . The plot was stupid , the characters were ALL different . Now I know they had to get rid of the kids from the first two , because as you can see Wednesday who was played by Christina Ricci in the first two is now an adult , making movies like Sleeping Hollow . But they could of casted better Wednesdays and Pugsleys for the Reunion , I mean these kids could not act at all and everything thy did was stupid . Uncle Fester who in the first 2 was played by Christopher LLoyd ( and brilliantly may I add ) , now they have some hyper active freak who goes around yelling and screaming like a two year old doing stupid pranks . . . It was then that it hit me , this new movie was not intended to be a sequel to the previous two . It was supposed to be a movie about the new Fox show " THE NEW ADDAMS FAMILY " , and no way related to the old Addams family . This movie was a huge flop and dissapointment and no wonder they decided to put it on video . If they had released it in the theater it would of made absolutely nothing and they would've gone broke . stars , it was horribly stupid , and I mean HORRIBLY stupid of a movie to make . . . .
431164	1173088	181689	1.0	Dissapointing	MINORITY REPORT was okay , but after all the hype , I got a weird sci-fi movie with a TOTAL RECALL 2 plot ( for anyone that doesn't understand , Phillip K . Dick , who wrote the short story WE CAN REMEMBER IT FOR YOU WHOLESALE-which was turned into a famous movie named TOTAL RECALL with Schwarzenegger-also wrote the MINORITY REPORT , which was actually nearly made TOTAL RECALL 2-and Arnold would've been in it instead of Cruise probably . I'm not making this up . It's in the commentary on the special edition total recall DVD . ) Anyway , MINORITY REPORT bored me halfway through . It was slow , and Tom Cruise was once again full of himself . Why can't anyone else see this ? Anyway , the movie wasn't as bad as I'm making it sound , but it was a dissapointment . It was also very predictable . If you want a good sci-fi see Total Recall , the prequel to this ( if you remember on mars in TR , the mutated aliens are psychic , THAT'S why they were going to make TR 2 instead of Minority Report .
430859	1173088	193187	2.0	A pathetic and insultingly childish fantasy set in reality	This film has been made dozens of times in other forms . This " Disney Original " idea is a complete laugh - if this is considered original , then I'm Abraham Lincoln . And I can't be Abraham Lincoln because I believe he is dead . Trevor Morgan ( you may remember him as the annoying kid from " Jurassic Park III " ) plays a complete nerd and mathematical genius who basically lives underneath a school ice hockey stadium . It is there that he constructs magical potions using science and math . However he realizes he's not exactly catching any ladies , so he adopts the persona of " Chaz " ( his real name is Charlie ) to woo the ladies - enrolling in school again and becoming a " bad boy " who talks back to teachers and looks " cool . " News flash : Kids stopped wearing Fonzie-style leather jackets to school in the 1960s . If anything , it's retro . It doesn't make you look cool . You don't gain instant respect by showing up at school with a leather jacket , a comb and a smirk and talking back to teachers . Today , in the age of gangsta rappas and emo , you would be laughed at and ridiculed . " Chaz " would become an instant outcast and his plan would backfire . But in " Genius " all the kids are friendly white suburbanite offspring and they love The Chaz . They fall victim to his evil ploy to get some girly-action and even the bad boys at school respect him . It would be kind of funny if it weren't so sad to actually think some Disney TV executive greenlit this and thought the concept of a 12-year-old high school graduate living in an underground lab who adapts a new persona of a leather-jacket wearing freak would be successful .
429501	1173088	138524	3.0	" Intolerable Cruelty " is a surprisingly aptly named film that offers nothing but multiple glances at one's watch and some restless shifting . It may not be cruel , but it's pretty damn intolerable .	So I sit there for the first half hour , waiting for it to get better , until the film starts to gradually become even worse . Is this possible ? I wonder to myself . Have the Coen Brothers - - Ethan and Joel - - made yet another bad movie ? To say that they haven't made a good movie since " Fargo " may not be true in some viewers ' opinions . Many people enjoyed " O Brother , Where Art Thou ? " and " The Man Who Wasn't There . " Although I thought that these two films were well made and distinctive , they were also both rather empty and dry - - a bit too cold and occasionally stupid for my own liking . And both " O Brother " and " The Man Who Wasn't There " substantially fall downhill in the third - - and final - - act . After " Intolerable Cruelty " was over I talked to the projectionist for a few moments on my way out . She said that she is a big Coen Brothers fan , but that she thinks they should stick to what they're best at . We both found the occasional moment of " Intolerable Cruelty " sporadically amusing , but I didn't laugh out loud a single time at this film - - which is a bad sign for a near-two-hour comedy that thinks it is very clever but really isn't . It is as if the movie believes itself to be as smart as " Fargo . " It just isn't . If I'm not mistaken , this is the first film from the Coen Brothers that was not essentially their sole idea in the first place . It is as though the Coens have co-ownership of the film ; Brian Grazer co-produced , the script was written by two other individuals ( along with the Coens ) , and all the flair and quirkiness of the earlier Coen outings - - such as " The Hudsucker Proxy " - - is practically invisible here . What a mess . Just when I thought George Clooney was starting to grow on me in a less-than-literal way , he turns out one of the most over-the-top performances in the history of film . He is Miles Massey , a hotshot divorce attorney who has a strange fetish about clean , white teeth . Clooney presents Miles the way he should be at first , but soon he becomes too silly to take seriously . It seems as though Clooney thought he was acting in some type of slapstick Farrelly Brothers movie here - - whereas he was over-the-top in " O Brother , " yet still seemed real , here he just seems like a dull sort of caricature of a lawyer - - not really a pun on attorneys , not really a pun on humans , just an in-between shell of some strange creature whose eyes bulge open all the time , and whose voice takes high pitches to accentuate certain adjectives and verbs . It's like a sort of unlikable " Saturday Night Live " character stretched out for a feature-length film - - minus the laughs of something such as " The Blues Brothers . " Sometimes I enjoyed Clooney's performance , and sometimes I found his casual performance refreshing . . . but more often than not he annoyed me , and I saw him as some type of very weird character . Have you ever seen " Clifford " ? He's like Martin Short's title character mixed with a pinch of the egotistical flair of Clooney himself . Disturbing , to say the least . Catherine Zeta-Jones does little but pose cleavage for the camera here - - she walks around in short , tight leather pants and makes subtle innuendos . ( Zeta-Jones : " I'm going to mount his behind on a wall and throw darts at it . " Clooney : " I'm still looking for a behind to mount . " Zeta-Jones : " Don't look at mine . " ) To be fair , she plays her evil character with the sort of touch it deserves - - but the ending is so silly and ridiculous that it made me feel cheated . Zeta-Jones , you see , is a sort of black widow - - she marries stupid rich men , divorces them , then takes all their money . But this time it hasn't worked , because her husband's ( Edward Herrmann ) attorney is Miles , who proves that her intention was to take his cash from the start . Even her evidence of his affair ( caught on tape by Cedric the Enterainer , who has a funny slogan ) is little enough to prove her innocence . So she decides to go after Miles himself - - marry him , take his money , and run away . It's a complicated mess but soon she finds herself truly falling in love with him . Well , that's the sort of plot summary I read about , anyway . The first paragraph I described was true . The second is not . There is no gradual love that forms between the two leads as their relationship goes on . The film staggers onwards for close to an hour and a half until they finally get married , and then she suddenly divorces him and is out the door . Then we get the typical ending that I need not delve into . You just have to see it for yourself to laugh at its sheer stupidity . I sincerely hope that the Coen Brothers didn't intend any audience to take such a contrived film seriously ? What we had here was great potential for an irreverent romantic comedy with smart dialogue , witty ideas and good central performances by arguably two of Hollywood's hottest sex symbols . Instead we get a slapstick farce that is as utterly stupid as it is unfunny , and as painfully long as it is boring . What went wrong ? I expected something much different from " Intolerable Cruelty . " I thought it would be a darker , funnier , more serious comedy . At first it was partially serious . Then it just fell away into a pit of silliness - - and the rest of the film is a further stumble downhill . Alice has fallen down the rabbit hole and the Coen Brothers are going after her . " Intolerable Cruelty " is a surprisingly aptly named film that offers nothing but multiple glances at one's watch and some restless shifting . It may not be cruel , but it's pretty damn intolerable . stars . - John Ulmer
430274	1173088	116322	3.0	Worse than I remember it being	I saw this when it came out in theaters back in 1996 . I remember I was already familiar with Elijah Wood's work ( that's right , he made stuff before " Lord of the Rings " ! ) and the merchandising tie-ins to the film were pretty abundant ( " Flipper " water guns were even circulating ) . Adults were reminded of the old movies and TV show and for nostalgia's sake took their kids to see it , who were excited because it was a movie about a dolphin and a stupid boy . Unfortunately it wasn't what anyone expected and flopped severely . You know a movie's in trouble when a boy swims away from a Hammerhead shark in the middle of the ocean , and a pack of dolphins scare the shark away , and the kid - - instead of getting out of the water into a boat - - floats in the water for five minutes thanking his dolphin for saving him . . . apparently he hasn't taken into mind that the shark is still out there , perhaps even below him . Another problem is Paul Hogan . He looks old , crusty and tired of recycling his Croc Dundee shtick . By now , no one even remembered " Crocodile Dundee " much less Hogan , and I half expected him to suddenly start pretending he didn't know what a hair dryer was for the sake of fish-out-of-water / social-satire laughs . All in all this is a really poor " family " movie that is amateurish and almost hard to watch at times . I hated it when I saw it in theaters back in ' 96 and I hate it more now .

Horrible , corny Disney-style " family comedy " about a notorious criminal ( Jack Palance ) who moves in with family man Chevy Chase and , eventually , causes a whole lot of trouble .

Peter O'Toole and Malcolm McDowell have both claimed they wish they had never made this film ( the latter of the two men reported this in an IMDb interview ! ) , and I can see why . Nothing but a nonsensical mess of softcore porn and a half-hearted attempt at a plot . Not much of anything here , other than cheap tricks and stupid scenes .

429560	1173088	257106	3.0	Lame and unfunny	The first " Scary Movie " was funny enough and had some pretty silly but enjoyable moments , like the " Usual Suspects " gag . It was a crude movie , but entertaining nonetheless . The sequel is ugly , rude , crude , obnoxious , unfunny , lame and totally out of ideas . It spoofs everything in sight - mostly " Exorcist " - but fails on almost all levels . The entire cast basically returns . This time they get summoned to a haunted mansion where possessions are occurring . Weird people - including a creepy owner and a sick chef - turn them off and they soon find themselves being pursued by evil . If the plot sounds lame , that's because it is . The cast is at a loss for words ; the Wayans Brothers recycle loads of gags from the first film and manage to make them worse . There are only two parts I laughed at . Most of the film is just crude for the sake of being crude , and that's a problem when none of the jokes are effective . I'd say skip this one and pretend it was never even made .
430729	1173088	75860	4.0	Overrated , disappointing sci-fi film that has become fondly remembered over the years . . . but why ?	Steven Spielberg's " Close Encounters of the Third Kind " ( 1977 ) is a genuinely silly , unfortunately outdated story . Its epic scope made it one of the highest-grossing films of 1977 , nominated for two Academy Awards ® ( it lost Best Visual Effects to George Lucas ' " Star Wars " ) . Now , 27 years later , it just seems goofy and sickeningly sweet . Spielberg adds a schmaltzy layer to most of his films that set his projects apart from the work of other directors . Arguably the most famous filmmaker since Hitchcock ( in terms of public recognition ) , Spielberg is responsible for some of the greatest films ever made . Most critics consider " E . T . " and " Close Encounters of the Third Kind " ? both films that deal with extra-terrestrial life ? to be some of his finest . For me , they are both rather disappointing . And unbearably sugar coated . So , what is the primary problem with " Close Encounters " ? Is it a bad movie ? No , not really . But it's not a particularly memorable one , either . Apart from a few so-called " classic " sequences ( the boy opening the door , the mashed potatoes , the alien arrival ) , the movie fails to spark much interest . Most of it ? to be completely blunt ? is quite stupid . Spielberg admits on the Special Edition DVD that he finds " Close Encounters " a bit too optimistic and unrealistic . When Spielberg made this movie , he believed in extra-terrestrial life , and was a young man with no children . In retrospect , Spielberg claims that the movie is a perfect snapshot of his youth , but as an adult , he would never make the movie the same way he did in ' 77 . One of the largest flaws is the fact that Roy Neary ( played by Richard Dreyfuss fresh off the success of Spielberg's 1975 smash hit " JAWS " ) abandons his own family ( wife and children ) to embark on a crazy search for extra-terrestrial life . In a matter of thirty minutes of screen time he has packed up , traveled to Wyoming , broken past blocked off roads , found a new romantic interest , and by the end . . . well . . . let's just say that the conclusion is rather shameful on Spielberg's behalf . It is quite evident that he had no firm grasp of moral obligation in ' 77 , and Roy's climactic decision is wholly unbelievable . Then again , most of the film is like that , too . Neary is an electrician who experiences a " close encounter " one night when a UFO seems to attack his car , and then flies off into the distance . Roy soon struggles with confusing mental images that have mysteriously implanted into his brain . Hounded by the smart Dr . Lacombe ( French director Francois Truffaut in his acting debut ) , Roy soon realizes that the extra-terrestrials plan to land on earth ? and he wants to be there , to see it all . Roy's evolution is too fast ? in a matter of what seem to be few days he has turned into a complete loon , and because of Spielberg's lack of character arc , the sudden change is startling and ? worst of all ? cold . We lose all sense of empathy for Roy , primarily because we do not experience his pain ? we see him suffering , sure , and moping around like a " cry baby , " as his son names him . But this happens so fast that we are left wanting more . The movie's conclusion ? which lasts over forty minutes long ? is the most exciting part , but the abrupt change of pace ( from being a slow-moving charming family film about " close encounters " to an oddball chase movie about the government covering up a dangerous conspiracy and hunting down escaped witnesses ) hinders the lasting impact . Spielberg is constantly trying to find a groove for his movie , and never really finds one to stay the course . Then , there's the long-awaited alien introduction ( which lasts over twenty minutes long ) . Most people flocked to the theaters in order to see this sequence ? the special effects showcase of the year . This is proven by the fact that Spielberg purposely draws out the scene for such a lengthy period of time . Then , audiences savored the F / X because they were the best since Stanley Kubrick's " 2001 : A Space Odyssey " ( even the trailer advertisements claimed this was so , in order to entice viewers ) . Now , they're outdated , by almost all standards of special effects . Watching them for twenty minutes becomes tiring . And of course , the annoying musical conversation between man and alien comes next ? something else that only makes the film more grating so many years later . " It's so ' 70s ! " someone once said . I agree . ( Many great masterpieces were made during the 1970s , but most people forget how many downright cheesy , forgettable movies were made , too . ) " Close Encounters of the Third Kind " simply does not hold up after 27 years , which is quite unfortunate . The F / X are shoddy , the ideas are insane , the movie is long and boring , and the direction and acting are about the only two things that approach greatness . Spielberg shows talent behind the camera here , but it is vastly inferior to " JAWS . " Even John Williams ' score fails to leave the same impact as " JAWS , " " Jurassic Park , " etc . Produced during a slew of " happy alien " movies ( followed by another slew of " mean alien " movies during the ' 80s after Ridley Scott's " Alien " in 1979 ) , " Close Encounters " is at times amusing , annoying , fast , long , and silly , all at once . The nation needed hope during the ' 70s , and they turned to the skies . Spielberg answered their calls , with a movie that set records , but is now nothing but a forgettable tale . Many will disagree with me when I say that " Close Encounters of the Third Kind " is an overrated , disappointing motion picture with few redeeming qualities . The harsh feedback should be interesting .
431146	1173088	960144	4.0	Disappointing	Look , I'm not one of those snobby cinema elitists who scoffs and upturns their nose at every Adam Sandler film that comes out . " Happy Gilmore " is one of my all-time favourite " guilty pleasures " and he's done a lot of entertaining films that aren't by any means thought-provoking or life-altering but , for all practical purposes , are fun to watch . Paul Thomas Anderson was quoted as having said the only reason he cast Sandler in " Punch-Drunk Love " was due to the fact that he was a huge fan of Sandler's comedies , which he enjoyed viewing because they always put him in a good mood . I think this is about the best description of his work that you'll find , and pinpoints my own feelings . But once in a while Sandler will make a real turkey , and " You Don't Mess with the Zohan " is one of the worst . Ranking alongside " Anger Management " and " Little Nicky , " Zohan - - the character - - offers little to like or enjoy , and " Zohan " - - the movie - - is even worse . Sandler's character in " The Waterboy " was annoying but the film was still funny if you're in the right mood . " Zohan's " problem is that it has an unlikeable character put in very unfunny predicaments , and relies on truly lame social / cultural jokes . Sometimes these type of stereotypical jabs can be passable in the same way the crudeness of " Happy Gilmore " is somewhat endearing , but " Zohan " offers them in such a direct and unpleasant manner that you're really just left straining to try to laugh at most of this stuff . Jewish people are hairy and talk funny ? Americans don't know the difference between Saudi Arabia and Iraq ? People in the Middle East dress like it's still 1989 ? This is essentially the whole film's joke , rehashed over . . . and over . . . and over again . Zohan is not a strong character for Sandler . He's gimmicky , just like Little Nicky , but rather than feeling strongly one way or another about him - - I just felt indifferent . He's not funny , which is a crucial hindrance to a film proclaiming itself as a comedy . The movie is just very inept . I was surprised to find Dennis Dugan had directed it , because he's usually one of Sandler's better collaborators ; yet this film is totally amateurish and incomprehensible . There's no real plot , and John Turturro is thanklessly wasted as a scenery-chomping villain . Emmanuelle Chriqui is beautiful but ultimately she's another in Sandler's long line of underwritten romantic interests . These characters are more excusable in his better comedies like " Gilmore " because we know the romance is unrealistic to begin with and is only there to fit a mold , but Chriqui is so earnest in her performance and displays so much promise that you are left wanting her to have a better script to work with . Sandler should embrace the concept of stronger romantic leads in his films , because I think it would vastly improve the storyline . Since " Zohan " is so lazy in its story and its romantic subplot is tacked-on and pointless , the other flaws of the film - - primarily the lack of funny material - - become far clearer . Speaking of weak material : Adam Sandler and Mike Myers seem to have recently both arrived at the conclusion that penis and sex jokes can sustain an entire comedy . They can't . The first time we see Sandler naked , it's a forced chuckle . When he has sex with a friend's mother to thank her for dinner and hospitality , it's a lame attempt at Borat-style cultural comedy . When Zohan begins cutting elderly women's hair in blatantly sexual manners and takes them all into the back office of a hair salon one-by-one for a sex montage of sorts , you just want to throw up a bit . I'm shocked that Sandler actually thought this material was funny . If he was going for " gross-out " laughter , then he fails on all levels . It's not funny , it's not gross , it's just stupid and off-putting . This movie is ultimately just disappointing because of how dull it is and how hard it tries - - or perhaps doesn't try - - in its effort to make teenagers laugh . The only thing I ever really look for in a typical Adam Sandler comedy is a fair amount of silly throw-away gags , raunchy or not . But " Zohan " can't even deliver on this - - its only real purpose . Hopefully Sandler and Myers will both grow out of this awkward sex-jokes-only phase of their careers . The underperforming box office results of both " Zohan " and " The Love Guru " may help them realize this sooner rather than later .
429864	1173088	192618	4.0	Pretty dire .	This aired on Disney a few years back as one of their infamous " Original Movies . " The concept is something from a " Simpsons " Halloween episode : a computer home is won by a family and they move in only to find their lives dominated by a glitch in the system . In this case the glitch is a visual representation of a woman who seems to think she's the mother of the new family that's moved in . . . she takes control of their lives and locks them inside the house . Ryan Merriman plays the whiz-kid genius who wanted to win the house , then decides , " Hey , Dad , maybe we shouldn't have moved in here " . . . after having complained about wanting to throughout the entire beginning of the film . No Disney Original Movie is going to be very good and this follows all the clichés - bad actors , bad script , inept director at the helm ( probably a TV veteran and first-timer when it comes to film-making ) . Overall this is not really worth your time as it is something " The Simpsons " managed to do in 30 minutes and even their version seemed more realistic and less insulting than this . . .
429369	1173088	190641	4.0	Dang . Overlooked By the Academy AGAIN !	" Pokemon the First Movie : Mewtwo Strikes Back " is not exactly low 100 material for IMDb , but it is pretty bad . I guess kids would like it if they like the show , but you'd have to be a pretty die hard fan . I guess that's why it's on the low 100 . No plot , no good characters , no interesting parts . Well , maybe some " original " parts , but nothing great . I think what really ruined this film was that awful Pika-Pika-whatever intro about some lightning creature and a bunch of Pokemen / mon . Otherwise , I feel this film would have an average rating of 4 instead of 3 . 3 . stars - John Ulmer
430103	1173088	228750	4.0	Proof That Taylor Hackford Is A Hack Who Makes Crap .	I doubt something like this would be made nowadays with the state of the world ( and the fact that so many Americans have been captured , held hostage , and murdered ) . However , this was released a year before it all started on September 11th , 2001 - - and chances are we'll never see a movie like this again for quite some time . Which is a shame , since this isn't a fond farewell to the sub-genre . First of all the film's plot - - about the husband of a woman ( Meg Ryan ) being captured by terrorists , held hostage , hopeless , attempted to be saved by a professional something-or-other ( Russell Crowe ) - - isn't very interesting . It's filmed in that modern " grain " filter that was once unique when Ridley Scott implemented it but is now quickly becoming tiring after a million films have used it ( take note of this Steven Soderbergh ) in an effort to make their hand-held-recorded shaky prints seem " realistic " and " gritty . " It just causes migraines after a while . The acting is sub-par , all considered ( Ryan seems drowsy and Crowe is annoying and one-dimensional as always ) , and the movie's main fault is that it's just helplessly , endlessly boring . I wasn't interested and had to literally pry my eyelids open to stay awake . How it ever got an average rating of 6 . 3 is beyond me . . . personally I'd give it . Poorly directed , poorly acted , poorly written - - poor all over , basically .
429753	1173088	115509	4.0	Why did they have to ruin it ?	Movies like these do not need sequels . Part of the advantage of Don Bluth moving away from Disney is that he didn't need to suffer their endless tirade of straight-to-video , poorly animated cash-in sequels . But apparently it was someone's brilliant idea to make a sequel to " All Dogs Go to Heaven , " so we get this . Charlie Sheen replaces Burt and he's not really as good . Most of the film is just a poor excuse for a sequel and it isn't nearly as dark , different or entertaining as the original . I feel sorry for future generations who are going to have to suffer endless sequels like this without ever knowing what it was like to have a time when Hollywood didn't totally rely on successful films as a crutch to release banal crap . Please , no more sequels to kids films that don't need ' em .
429313	1173088	170016	4.0	How the Grinch stole what could have been a good film	Dr . Seuss ' How the Grinch Stole Christmas is based on the childrens book by Dr . Seuss . In this live action film , Jim Carrey brings to life one of the most beloved stories of our time to the big screen with the direction of Ron Howard . The plot is taken straight from the book with a few creative liberties along the way . Inside a snowflake exists the magical land of Whoville . In Whoville , live the Who's , A munchkin like species that all love and adore Christmas . Yet just outside of their beloved Whoville lives the Grinch . The Grinch is a nasty , green creature that hates Christmas , and plots to steal it away from the Whos which he equally loathes . Yet a small child named Cindy Lou Who , decides to try befriend the Grinch and teach him what Christmas is really about . What is probably the most interesting aspect of The Grinch is the cinematography of Whosville that Ron Howard brought to life . It would be very hard to live up to Dr . Seuss ' standards in the book , but Whosville itself in this film is basically the only delight you have while watching . Jim Carrey does fit into the Grinch well , but too often we get an Ace Ventura vibe . Now I ask myself even in dramas why Jim Carrey always seems funny , even when he's acting serious , why is this ? In the Grinch at times he seems calmed down to a certain degree , but the longer the camera rolls the more he starts to act up and eventually we can just picture Ace walking in that snow instead of the Grinch . One other thing I disliked is that in the cartoon the Grinch never talked much , but in this version all the Grinch does is talk . Of course both these films were taken off the book , but I still think Jim should have shut up half the time instead of rambling and doing wacky and crazy movements ( like Ace . ) The humor itself consists of only a few funny lines . In one scene the Grinch is sitting looking through his ' schedule ' and is saying something like ' 1 : 30 Loathe-2 : 30 Have lunch with myself . . I CAN'T cancel that again ! 3 : 30 Feel sorry for myself . . ' And the scene basically goes on like that . I think that is probably the funniest scene in the film , and if you don't find that funny , you will hate the Grinch . I first saw this film in the theaters and expected too much . Perhaps that is why when I viewed the video release I enjoyed it more . If for some reason you do want to see this film , just don't expect it to be great and you might enjoy it more . I wouldn't recommend this film unless you're an absolute fan of Dr . Seuss and in your opinion ' must see it . ' Other than that , avoid the Grinch's good looks and charm , because there is not much of it in the film . starsJOHN ULMER

429754	1173088	110442	4.0	Pretty lame	The first " Major League " was enjoyable ( even if it wasn't great or anything ) whereas this cash-in sequel is basically just to suck the money out of a film that made more cash at the box office than anyone expected . The first " Major League " came out in ' 87 and this one in ' 94 ; the seven-year gap surely didn't help much with profit . As far as I'm aware this didn't do nearly as well as the original in theaters and it's not hard to understand why . Most of the original cast returns - mainly Tom Berenger and Charlie Sheen though - to once again spoof baseball . It's not as wacky a comedy as , say , " Hot Shots ! " , but it's close . The real problem with this film is that it's basically extending a story that doesn't need to be extended and recycling a lot of jokes we've already seen . It's worth seeing if you catch it on television , but don't go out of your way - especially if you didn't care much for the original .
429867	1173088	318403	4.0	A disgrace to the original	I found this to be an utter waste of time , effort and money . I know Disney always displays lack of creativity when making " straight-to-video " films - but rehashing the plot of the original film with a " new perspective " is an all-time low . . . soon they'll just be re-releasing the original films with new animation and new songs and be calling it a " new version of the movie we all love . " Nathan Lane surprisingly returns to his role of Timon yet again . Timon and Pumbaa the animated animals from the world of the original " Lion King " embark on a narrative journey to tell us the original story the way it REALLY happened . . . as they see it . Of course Timon is now the hero of the story , yadda yadda yadda , blah blah blah . . . The musical sequences are lame and the animation is crap . The vocal talents are impressive for a video feature , but then again , when was the last time you remember Matthew Broderick , Whoopi Goldberg or Nathan Lane being in anything of real commercial substance ? Overall if you liked the original you'll hate this . It's insulting because it's unfair to children and adults alike . And that about sums it up .
430033	1173088	99091	5.0	Haven't I seen this before ?	Michael is a straight-flying young business kid who gets into a fight with a jealous boyfriend one night at a bar . Suddenly a mysterious stranger intervenes and saves him from a beating . The stranger disappears but later that night , while jogging , Michael bumps into him on a pier again ( a foreshadowing of later events in the film ) . Soon the stranger named Alex steps into Michael's life and turns it upside down , revealing himself as a sociopathic monster after it's too late . If you think this plot summary sounds as if it has homosexual underlinings , perhaps it does . I mean for goodness sake what kind of grown man invites his hero to an underground club and lets him take control of his life ? It's " Single White Female " with men . Maybe Alex and Michael love each other . I don't know . It seems like every film I've seen lately has been treating friendship as a sexual thing - - Freeman said " Shawshank " is about two men who love each other more than friends ( which I disagree with ) , " Chasing Amy " was none too subtle and then we have all sorts of other films like this that imply some kind of homoerotic subtext . Frankly it's kind of grating , I miss those old films where two men were allowed to be close without being gay . ( " Midnight Run " , anyone ? ) This is kind of like " Unlawful Entry " meets " Fight Club , " only it's worse than both . On one hand we've got really bad acting from Rob Lowe as a sociopath ( please ! ) and James Spader doing another dork impression . ( Oh wait , it's not an impression ! Aha I get it now . ) The script has no twists like " Fight Club " and the direction is mediocre . The script is by David Koepp , a good writer of thrillers but he turns this one into a parody of itself . Not an awful movie , but not as good as it could have been for sure .
429445	1173088	271285	5.0	A Guilty Pleasure	Face ValueThis movie is about as average as they come . But for being a made-for-TV film , it's not all that bad . Scott Baio , ex-child star in real life , plays a young man who goes to visit an old friend of his who resides in California . His friend's got it all : Nice house , great car , lots of neat accessories , friends , and , or course , women . But after Baio's friend mysteriously disappears , and Baio suspects foul play in a boating accident , Baio adapts to the persona of his friend for a while . But this idea backfires when the bad guys who killed his friend start coming after Baio , thinking they didn't succeed in their job . Or is that what it's all about ? This film is about as average as they come . We've seen it all before , and much , much better . But for being a television movie , it's not half bad . Scott Baio's not the worst actor in the world , even if the others in the film rank high in the " bad actor " category . Director Michael Miller wanders around helplessly trying to decide where his prized film should head - - it ends up in the gutter , for the main part , but let's face it : This movie is nowhere near as bad as it could have become . The script by James G . Hirsch is right out of a TV film , with things like , " Hey , cowboy ! " and weird catchphrases for the characters . The dialogue is stiff and weak - - but again , not as bad as it could have been . The plot - - what little of it there is - - is so average it's mind-numbingly bad . Everything that happens is utterly predictable and there is not one moment of real suspense . But then again , it's a television movie , so I can't blame it too much . I sat down to watch this movie with the lowest of expectations , and I came out with a bit higher of a standard for made-for-TV movies . " Face Value " is awful as a film itself , but as a TV movie ? It's not all that bad . To tell you the truth , it was a bit of a guilty pleasure as I watched it late at night on Friday . A nice film to relax you and take you out for a bit . Just don't look upon it with critical eyes , and you'll find yourself actually enjoying it . stars on a level of regular film , when compared to TV films , brings the average to stars . John Ulmer
430854	1173088	202470	5.0	Laughably bad to the point of unintentional self-satire	Marky Mark Wahlberg plays a rock star wannabe who rocks out at rock concerts with his rockin ' girlfriend and rocking friends . He gets into fights with competing rock band members and his older brother , who hates rock music and is a police officer , makes fun of him for being a wannabe rock star . So the titular rock star eventually becomes a real rock star , headlining his favorite rock band as a rock singer . Notice how I keep using the word " rock " a lot ? That's because this movie is inundated with rock - and in a bad way . Hair metal died with the ' 80s - making a retro picture now ? It's not surprising the film didn't even recoup half of its $38 , 000 , 000 budget in theaters . I'm not picking on hair metal , but if you look at Motley Crue or KISS , at least they had attitude . The bands in this film are lame ! I guess Mark thought this would be a good semi-sequel to " Boogie Nights " - he satirized the ' 70s porn industry , now why not ' 80s gratuity ? - but , unfortunately , at the helm of director Stephen " I Haven't Made a Good Movie in Years and Am Still Riding on the Coattails of ' Bill & Ted ' and ' Mr . Holland's Opus ' " Herek , " Rock Star " looks like a laughable , silly picture . Oh , and Jennifer Aniston's annoying performance as Mark's girlfriend only adds to the fun .
430970	1173088	143145	5.0	Danger . Suspense . Excitement . Not This Time .	The World is Not EnoughI have tried to sit through this Bond film multiple times , and I only did so the first time I viewed it . I figure that you should stick with a movie , through good times and bad . First of all , I don't like wasting money on something . Secondly , I like to see it all just to say I saw it . Third of all , I see it all so I can review it . So I sat through this film the first time , but it was painful the second and third , and I found myself going over to the computer and typing up some reviews instead . The movie isn't all that bad in the beginning , other than having a few outrageous stunts ( even for a Bond film ) , but it's from the midway on that bores me . It just becomes dull . This Bond outing features Pierce Brosnan going after some baddies bent on doing something somewhere , for some reason or another . All I could make out was that there is a guy with a bullet in his brain that slowly eats away his " pain receptors , " making him " immune to pain . " That is the excuse for an indestructible bad guy who stands a chance against Bond . Bond teams up with Sophie Marceau to track down the bad guy , but soon finds himself with Bond Girl Denise Richards , playing Christmas Jones : Short pants , tight shirt covering big breasts , and big lips . Oh , yeah : She's a nuclear chemist out in the middle of nowhere with a bunch of other chemists - - all stupid men that dress decently and actually look like someone who would have gone through years of chemistry instead of vogue class . Now , I can accept beautiful women in most Bond films : It's the franchise's strongest trait . Or one of the strongest traits . But having Denise Richards play a nuclear chemist is beyond belief : It's truly laughable ! Pierce Brosnan once again proves to be a great Bond runner-up : I'll be saddened when he stops playing the character . But hey , he's in his fifties - - let's be thankful he even lasted through one of the films much less 1 . . . 2 . . . 3 . . . 4 . . . etc . . . Sophie Marceau is nice as a Bond girl , but she is wasted at the sight of Denise Richards , who does not even know the meaning of acting , much less contain the charisma to become a Bond girl . Not that she's a horrible actress , but you have to see her in this movie to understand where I'm coming from . This is probably one of the worst Bond films I've seen . My favorites include : " Goldfinger , " " Dr . No , " " From Russia with Love , " " Moonraker , " " Goldeneye " and a few others . If you like any of those Bond films , I suggest you stay away from this painful excuse for a Bond film . The first half is pretty good , but the last half is miserably slow-paced . I always turn it off half way through . I suggest you do , as well . Perhaps the only other point of seeing this film is to say a fond farewell to Q played by Desmond Llewelyn ( 1914-1999 ) . By the way , John Cleese takes over Q's position as R . Unfortunately , not even he can save this film . stars - John Ulmer
429642	1173088	106627	5.0	Entertaining in a bad way .	" The Crush " is about a fourteen-year-old girl ( Alicia Silverstone ) who falls in love with a journalist neighbor , played by Cary Elwes ( of " Saw " infamy ) . Elwes rejects her come-ons and after she tries to kiss him gives her a slight warning . However her advances are so strong that after a while he is left dazed , as she accuses him of sexual abuse and has the police arrest him . Destined to clear his name for good , he embarks on a mission to expose her " crush " - and prove to everyone once and for all that she's a psychopath . A lot of movies like this were made back in the ' 80s and ' 90s starting with " Fatal Attraction , " although this is one of the more entertaining ones . As far as the acting goes , Silverstone is very sexy ( she was older than 14 during filming so I can say this without coming across as a perv ) - she's good at playing a devious flirt . Elwes experiments with his off-again-on-again American accent and the good news is that it's more convincing here than in " Saw " ( 2004 ) . Except for a few scenes , he pretty much sounds convincing . His acting is up to par as well . It's not a great movie but it's entertaining , which is exactly what it should be .
429316	1173088	146316	5.0	Jolie does bring the character to life , but the screenplay's just dull !	While Angelina Jolie does bring the Lara Croft Tomb Raider character to life on the big screen , unfortunately the script and dialogue is just boring . The overall effects are done nicely . In one scene there is a fight involving a bunji harness in Croft's mansion where Jolie swings around doing little martial arts moves , kicking bad guys , and zipping around on the cord . I liked this scene because it was very original . But then there're other scenes and monologue that are just out of place . The end pretty much messed up the rest of what I DID enjoy out of this film . It was utterly ridiculous , not in the ways of " she could never do that " but more of a really dumb plot ending . Perhaps the sequel will be better than this . I sure hope so . It seems most of the time the director of this film was too focused on getting teen males to enjoy the film by zooming and / or focusing on Angie's tight , short clothes , and ahem " big " chest ( how else to put it-it's true ) rather than giving the audience an interesting storyline . Tomb Raider is worth viewing once , just for the fact there're some scenes very interesting and original , but just fast forward the last 30 , dull and ridiculous minutes . stars -
429825	1173088	280609	5.0	The first hour is great , the second hour . . . isn't .	Low-budget horror movies were once original back when Sam Raimi and Tobe Hooper actually made good films out of them , but nowadays it's exactly the opposite . Cheap movies are just as bad as expensive ones , if not more so , and they've become the very thing they shouldn't be : boring . " Dog Soldiers " is a low-budget British werewolf movie hybrid ? it mixes elements of war with sci-fi , horror , comedy and drama . It's a commendable effort . The first hour is a blast . But the second hour is a mess ? and not in a good way , either . Plot holes become more abundant than donuts at a police station and characters transform into the all-too-typical cardboard cutouts of cinema , spewing the same stupid garbage we hear from every horror movie released today . " I'll be back ! " and two seconds later they're dead , or the " We've got to stick together and be more than men " bull delivered by a soldier to his fellow comrades in order to boost their morale . It is so annoying . Or how about the tough-but-naïve character we're supposed to like , who's kept around until the end , when he finally dies an honorable death ? Yawn . The plot : A pack of British soldiers ( Sean Pertwee , Kevin McKidd , Liam Cunningham and Darren Morfitt ) are on a routine training mission in the Scottish high lands when they inadvertently stumble across a pack of bloodthirsty werewolves . After their team is ambushed and their Sergeant left dying , they take refuge in a nearby deserted farmhouse . But the wolves are just warming up for dessert . As I mentioned above , the first hour is superb . The camera work was a bit too fast , but worked well when building suspense and paranoia . The acting was fairly good , the dialogue even better . Like " Predator , " it builds itself up as a war film , and then turns into a monster movie . Unlike " Predator , " however , " Dog Soldiers " becomes silly , stupid and boring . It relentlessly rips off every movie in sight ? also including " Evil Dead , " " Aliens , " " Platoon , " " Blair Witch Project , " " The Thing " ? and to be fair , it does try to deliver a lot of fun ; the problem is that the movie is incredibly insulting and childish . Of course , no movie about werewolves is going to attempt to explain itself seriously ( or let's just hope it won't ) ? and " Dog Soldiers " doesn't . But there's a fine line between suspension of disbelief and feeling cheated ? it crosses the line . The ending is cheap , tacky and dissatisfying . I heard they're making a sequel , subtitled " Fresh Meat . " Let's hope it's fresh material this time around .
429673	1173088	106292	5.0	Another Miserable Retread . . .	" That's it , nobody calls me Ed McMahon ! " - Emilio Estevez saying the funniest line from a rather dry sequel " Another Stakeout " was six years in the waiting . After the first film , " Stakeout , " made a huge splash at the box office in 1987 ( the same year another cop-buddy film came out - - can you guess which one ? ) , everyone anticipated an unnecessary - - but perhaps funny - - sequel that would inevitably result after box office earnings were tallied up by film executives in an office somewhere . Alas , the six years passed , and we got . . . this mess ? Richard Dreyfuss and Emilio Estevez reprise their roles as stakeout cops who get paired with a new partner in this watered-down sequel . The new partner is played by Rosie O'Donnell , who is so startlingly unfunny in this it almost makes you involuntarily switch off the television as soon as you see her chubby face smiling at you . The story starts with a bang - - literally - - as a trial witness being protected by the CIA is unsuccessfully assassinated - - and by that I mean : They die , she lives . What a surprise . ( This is the type of scene where the villain is able to blow up a house but the witness just happens to be taking a stroll outside as it happens - - or something like that - - preventing her from dying along with the other agents who were previously protecting her . This type of thing was spoofed greatly in the truly underrated " Last Action Hero . " It's not a joke in " Another Stakeout . " ) Unfortunately for the United States , the trial witness never returns - - she runs away and doesn't let anyone know where she is . Afraid she may be in danger , afraid to lose a star witness , and believing that she might try to contact old friends , the gruff chief of police assigns the unlucky trio of Dreyfuss , Estevez and Donnell to watch the her old pals to see if she turns up . She eventually does , of course , but first we get some painfully unfunny buddy-buddy moments between Dreyfuss and Estevez and O'Donnell . She brings a bunch of clothing and a dog with her . They don't like it . Har-har . This was used a bit better in " Spaceballs , " in which Princess Vespa brought along that entire luggage through the desert ( remember ? ) . This is just a copy of that scene , minus the punch line . Estevez also shaves his mustache , which is supposed to be a type of sacred moment and is referenced at least ten times throughout the film ( he goes to stroke his mustache , he complains about chopping it off , Dreyfuss complains about it , etc . ) . But for heaven's sake , he's only been in one film so far - - we've only seen the mustache once - - so a better thing to do would have been this : make a few more sequels and , when the last entry comes , have him shave it off . By then the audience realizes that his mustache is part of him , and that losing it is like losing part of his soul . But I'm glad they didn't make any more than one sequel . One of the things that kept the " Lethal Weapon " franchise going was the fresh ideas , fresh buddies , and fresh scripts . ( Great actors never hurt an action comedy , either . ) The " Stakeout " franchise - - which didn't even last long enough to spawn more than one sequel - - tries to copy this formula but isn't sure how . The introduction of Joe Pesci in " Lethal Weapon 2 " was great because he thereby became the Third Stooge , whereas O'Donnell's entry into the series is nothing but a humiliating reminder that talk show hosts can't always act in front of a camera and maintain the same type of humor they may ( or may not ) exhibit on their ( awful ) TV " talk show . " ( Which is , by the way , consumed of entirely staged so-called " interviews . " ) And whereas Pesci , as Leo Getz , added a type of silly vibe to the " LW " series , O'Donnell just seems like a carbon copy clone of Estevez from the first " Stakeout . " Dreyfuss didn't like him at first , and - - guess what - - they suddenly became best buds . The same thing happens in the sequel , much to the audience's chagrin . Of course , " Lethal Weapon " and its sequels were never more than a few years apart ( the first coming out in 1989 , two years after the original ) . But " Stakeout " had six years to make a respectable sequel , and it fails . It fails the same way that many prolonged sequels do . But , for once , it's not because the audience has forgotten the original film - - it's because the audience is fed up with the same routine . The film was directed by John Badham , which is surprising , since he's a talented director ( " Saturday Night Fever , " " The Hard Way , " " Stakeout " ) . Here he jumps through all the hoops , turning his own series into a pale retread of the original - - only watered down : minus the violence , language , nudity , and humor . I'm not saying a movie has to be R to be funny . But if you've got a sequel to an R-rated movie like " Stakeout " and you decide to turn its sequel into a cutesy-tutesy children's entertainment program , you'd better advise the audience before they sit down expecting something funny and fresh . What a disappointment . stars . - John Ulmer
429569	1173088	119668	5.0	Not particularly very good	A magazine reporter named John Kelso ( John Cusack ) decides to do a story on a Christmas party hosted by an infamous eccentric named Jim Williams ( Kevin Spacey ) in Savannah . John enjoys the part but feels taken aback and apprehensive when he meets Jim's abusive lover , Billy . Billy winds up dead , and Kelso stays in Savannah to cover the trial . He soon encounters a huge variety of oddballs such as a spiritualist , an old man who threatens to poison the town's water supply , and a drag queen comedienne . Any film should be given a chance , and I was willing to do so for " Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil , " despite having heard rather negative things about it in advancement . Unfortunately , I was not impressed . Clint Eastwood has been , of recent , a very reliable director - but he wasn't always , and this is more proof of that . Is it ambitious ? Yes , very much so . TOO much so . It tries to hard to be mysterious , and ultimately it comes across as silly , superfluous and pretentious . Good performances , though . Especially by Spacey and Cusack . Shame about the rest of it .
429829	1173088	238380	5.0	I didn't like it	Someone had highly recommended " Equilibrium " to me , claiming it was better than " The Matrix " and a forgotten film that slipped under the radar in 2002 . Seeing how I never really bought into the whole " Matrix " craze , I figured this might be the more intelligent and unpretentious stylized action film I was looking for . Well , I was wrong . The movie opens in the future . A bunch of guys are tracking down criminals who have stolen the Mona Lisa . At first , we think they're trying to save the painting . Then we find out that they are actually trying to take it away so they can burn it . In the future , all art and other things associated with feelings , senses , creativity and emotions are banned . Humans take small pills that restrict that from feeling any emotions whatsoever . One of the law enforcement officers ( Christian Bale ) decides to stop taking his pill after being convinced not to . He realizes what he's been missing out on , but is afraid the others will find out so he has to keep his cool . Unfortunately a conscience prohibits him from ruthlessly murdering people anymore . Soon other agents realize what has happened and he is put on the next hit list . " Equilibrium " is all style , no substance . It has a really promising plot , but it doesn't go anywhere with it . It's not based around paranoia and fear ; it's based around how much butt you can kick , and how well you can kick it . I admire the effort . The director on the DVD commentary track seems really into his material and loves the movie . He says he's really sad it was misunderstood on release ( the critics lambasted it , helping it die a quick death at the box office ) . However , I have to admit I can see where the critics were coming from . The fight scenes are pretty cool but they aren't entertaining after a while ; the ending in particular didn't emotionally affect me in any way , and watching loads of people getting slaughtered loses its novelty after a while . I liked the fact that the whole hero-vs . - villain fight was about untypical as you can get ( I won't ruin it , but suffice to say , it wasn't what I was expecting ) . But other than that , the movie isn't that good .
430858	1173088	101745	5.0	I've never been able to warm up to this	Minor SPOILERS ahead ! I've never been able to watch " Doc Hollywood " the entire way through . There is something about it that I find very hard to focus on . No , I don't have a low attention span . The story just doesn't interest me . It's very rare for me , especially , to ever just " not " watch a movie - I'm the guy who has an unwritten law that restricts me from exiting a theater during a really horrible movie . When there's something on TV , and I start watching it , I sit through it all . " Doc Hollywood " had me eager to get up and do something else the entire way through . I was constantly trying to find justifiable opportunities to leave the room . The set-up is refreshing . I love the opening sequence with Chesney Hawks ' " The One and Only . " After that it goes downhill . The ever-likable Michael J . Fox plays a great surgeon who decides to move to Hollywood and became a plastic surgeon . Mid-way he wrecks his convertible and finds himself in some hillbilly town in the middle of nowhere , with an assortment of odd - but likable - characters . We get the stereotypical love interest . . . the clichéd subplots . . . the routine everything . The entire film is so predictable that major plot turns could literally be written on a small piece of paper : Guy gets new job , finds himself is weird town with different people , falls in love with the hard-to-get country girl , messes up and breaks up , then gets back together with her , stays in the town , lives happily ever after . I used to live in the sort of town portrayed in " Doc Hollywood . " It's not very realistic , but that's OK , it's just a movie . Plus , Michael J . Fox is arguably one of the most likable actors of all time - always able to give his cute kid smile to warm up the audience . He's always an innocent , using this sort of continual character in projects such as " Casualties of War " ( where he was the good guy against a bunch of bad guys in Vietnam ) and , of course , " Back to the Future . " The movie has a pretty great cast , including co-stars such as Bridget Fonda and Woody Harrelson , but it never amounts to much of anything at all . It's as if a bunch of loose puzzle pieces were placed together to form a rather haphazard and routine story . The movie relies on oozing charm to entice its viewers . Normally , a film such as " Doc Hollywood " works its magic on me , but there's something about this particular film that has never , ever appealed to me , and unfortunately I just don't think it ever will .
429499	1173088	450278	5.0	It's either a severely mis-advertised comedy or a terrible horror film - but I will admit I was entertained	I still can't decide whether " Hostel " is a mis-marketed comedy or a terrible excuse for a horror film . It's no surprise Quentin Tarantino produced it - he loved " Wolf Creek , " which was also very gory - but " Wolf Creek " was scary and well-made whereas " Hostel " was cheesy , humorous and so unbelievably over-the-top I didn't know whether to laugh or be afraid . I had heard people talking about the excessive gore - but it's all goofy . The girl with her eyeball hanging out looks like she has a cheap ' 80s monster movie effect glued to her . A few parts made me cringe in anticipation , because I _ thought _ something gruesome was going to happen - but it always turned out being more funny than anything . Some critics said it's a satire of American tourism . I doubt it . I don't think Eli Roth is that smart . I think he wanted to make something fairly tongue-in-cheek while at the same time satisfying his lust for blood . ( He loves blood in horror movies - check out his list of favorites or his previous film , " Cabin Fever , " which is what attracted QT to producing this movie . ) The first hour is a teen sex comedy with three guys ( Jay Hernandez , Derek Richardson and Eythor Gudjonsson ) traveling to Europe to experience a good time . They visit seedy Dutch locales and see loads of American tourists ( " Are there even any Dutch people here ? ! " ) , then travel farther east and wind up going to a hostel where they share a room with two hot , constantly-naked babes who apparently are unaware of the material we would refer to as " clothing . " This is where I began to feel my intelligence become gradually insulted . Was Roth satirizing American stereotypes of Eastern-European countries ? Was he satirizing the horror genre's gratuitous nudity ? Or was he just buying time to get to the blood n ' guts and figured he'd fill up the running time by getting some really gorgeous women naked on set for the hell of it ? I think it was probably the last one . After all the random nudity , sex and American machismo , the movie suddenly veers into " horror " territory by showing weird Slovakian perverts slicing n ' dicing American tourists for their sick pleasure . Uh , yeah ! I forgot to mention something : this film purports to be based on " a true story . " Riiiight . ( According to Roth , he saw a mysterious website once - that he strangely hasn't seen again since - advertising a similar experience for paying customers . I think perhaps Mr . Roth was smoking something at the time , but we'll never know , I guess . ) The rest of the movie is pointless to divulge any further into . Suffice to say , if you like really cheesy movies that rely solely on gratuitous violence to scare you , this will be right up your alley . Personally , I didn't find it scary at all . The beginning - the sex stuff - is scarier than the actual violence later on because it has atmosphere and an air of anticipation - you know something bad is going to happen . And the movie works best in this mode . Once it starts exploiting the torture and violence , it just becomes laughable and predictable . And then , of course , we get the stereotypical hero who is too stupid to realize that if he escapes alone he can send back help for ALL the people rather than risk his life to go back into the hostel to rescue ONE person . Eh , what does he know , anyway . Dumb American tourist . ( See - I can make fun of tourists like Mr . Roth , too ! )
431064	1173088	268677	6.0	A Fine Cast ; A Decent Family Film . . .	Jonathan Taylor Thomas , Howie Mandel , David Hyde Pierce , Jenna Elfman , Marlon Wayans and Tom Bosley make up the cast of " The Tangerine Bear , " a decent family film that features a fine cast and " okay " animation . Tangy is a teddy bear who has tragically been created with an upside-down smile . In this film he basically sits in a toy shop and is a good samaritan to other toys , and of course the sentimental ending is included . The animation may not be great , the story may be a bit dry , but " The Tangerine Bear " isn't that bad . Just decent . It's clean entertainment to be enjoyed around the holiday , which as I write this , is coming up very soon . stars - - John Ulmer
429652	1173088	818823	6.0	I admire the effort and enjoyed it more the second time , but I still have some reservations .	I submitted an unfair review of this film about a week ago to IMDb . The movie's director , Aaron Howland , actually contacted me about it . I made some allegations about " false voting " because the movie's rating was about ( or something in that region ) and featured two 10-star reviews by authors who hadn't been active on the site since submitting their comments . I said some things I shouldn't have and was corrected by Mr . Howland . It turns out that the reason the movie had so many positive votes is because people who are part of their e-mail list were notified of the movie's entry on IMDb and , as a result , came here and voted for the film as fans would typically do . And it turns out that - to the best of my knowledge - Mr . Mann didn't do much vote boosting here either . Anyway , I appreciated Mr . Howland's comments and decided to give this film another chance . I still have some reservations about it , but this time when watching it I guess I didn't have as much of a prejudice against it from the start and wasn't as hard on it . It's a low-budget independent flick so it would be stupid to criticize it on the level of a mainstream production . Its humor , as I said in my original review , is a bit basic in some portions , but that may appeal to others more so than myself - and I'll admit it was funnier the second time around . My one complaint I still hold is that the gag reel at the end probably goes on a bit too long . Usually I enjoy a gag reel during credits of movies like " Rush Hour , " but sometimes - such as the ten minute + gag reel at the end of " The Master of Disguise " - they just go on too long . . . especially if the movie is short to begin with . I understand that Mr . Howland probably had a good portion of material he thought was funny - outtakes from the production - but this may not appeal as much to people who were not involved with the production of the film . Of course , I could be wrong and someone else may find it completely hilarious . I suppose humor is really in the eye of the beholder . . . or something like that . The acting isn't bad considering its roots as a non-mainstream picture with a mostly unrecognizable cast . There are some clever jokes - more so in the middle than the beginning or end . I can't find it in myself to lie and say I thought this was very good - I think some jokes fall a bit flat and the general structure is a bit sloppy at times - but then again I am going to be harder on movies because I've been criticizing them on this site for a few years now . What I appreciate is the cast and crew's apparent enthusiasm for film-making , and as an occasional filmmaker myself who has made a few short features and a documentary film I know how hard it can be to work with limited equipment and supplies . All considered , I'd give this a slight recommendation for people who are tolerable of independent features . I see some potential and wish Mr . Howland the best of success in the future , because I think if he takes the better aspects of this movie and makes another , using them to his advantage , the result would probably be a bit more consistent .
430361	1173088	83232	6.0	Not as good as it could have been	Los Angeles , 1948 . Robert De Niro is a Catholic priest whose brother ( Robert Duvall ) , a seedy cop , has been assigned to the case of a brutally murdered young prostitute . Through a matter of irony the girl is linked to the priest , who was present in a car with her prior to her death , and soon controversy flairs and a big to-do is made of it . " True Confessions " plays a bit too slowly , and is rather predictable . It also does a poor job of managing some of its plot - - it tries to criticize the absurdity of the press at some points , but just becomes a victim of its own satire when it unrealistically links events together via newspapers in the film . De Niro is believable as a priest , although maybe a bit too young for the role . Duvall is impressive as a gruff detective - - not a typical role for the actor . ( Darker than he usually is in most movies . ) If you're a fan of the actors I'd try to watch this at least once in your lifetime just for the sake of being able to say or know that you saw it - - but I wouldn't go out of my way to see it if I were you .
430352	1173088	117509	6.0	Vibrant and cool ; also sort of mediocre . . .	An entertaining , if seriously flawed , re-telling of Shakespeare's classic tale of young love starring Leonardi DiCaprio and Claire Danes as the infamous duo who sacrificed themselves over true love . Top-notch cast and some crazy modern-day direction by Baz Luhrman ( " Moulin Rouge ! " ) certainly makes for one of the strangest films to ever hit the big screen . stars . - John Ulmer
430527	1173088	119528	6.0	One of Carrey's finest - - it doesn't try to be anything it isn't . Would I lie ?	" My dad is a liar , " a small child says . " You mean a lawyer , " his teacher responds . He shrugs his shoulders . They're both the same , aren't they ? Jim Carrey is a liar in " Liar Liar " ( 1997 ) , which successfully uses Jim Carrey - - the king of annoyance - - to its full advantage . Jim Carrey has , given time , grown on me . I didn't like him at first . Then I learned to put up with him . Now I find him perfect for some film roles such as Lloyd Christmas in " Dumb and Dumber " ( 1994 ) . I never think that Jim Carrey is ideal for a role , really , until I see him in it , and then I think that no one could have done it quite so well . But I still don't particularly think he's a very good comedian , per se . Here he plays Fletcher Reede , a high-grade attorney so caught up in his work that he has little time to devote to his young son , Max ( Justin Cooper ) , the type of plot-created kid that these type of films deserve . Max is mad that his dad keeps missing out on all his activities , so his birthday wish is every lawyer's worst nightmare : no lying . Max wishes ( or commands ) that his father can no longer tell any lies , and the wish is granted by the powers that be . This is a problem for Fletcher , indeed , since he has just acquired the case of an adultress housewife ( Jennifer Tilly ) who wants to keep her kids . She spills the truth to Fletcher - - that she has had many affairs - - and this is not the type of thing a man uncapable of lying is able to cope with . Fletcher spills his guts at the court proceedings , tarnishing his image as a professional lawyer . In one of the film's better scenes , he walks into a court bathroom and beats himself up , slamming his head in a toilet and punching himself so that he can postpone the trial to a later date . Why is the sight of a man violently clapping his head against and between a toilet seat funny ? Because it's Jim Carrey who , as I mentioned above , may not be the funniest man alive , but by the box office numbers may technically be - - and he does have a knack for physical , spastic comedy ( too bad it can overtake his roles sometimes ) . Here he unleashes it when it is needed , and it works , because it is not a pointless exercise in energetic behavior , but quite the contrary . The situations one can get into with the restrictions of only telling the truth are limitless . These types of formulas always work good in Carrey's movies - - those involving abnormal abilities . There's a reason they keep making similar films following the same formula . As my ( small number of ) readers probably know , I am not a commercial critic with my grading scale . I am quite conservative , only giving high ratings to films that really deserve them . I hesitate to give " Liar Liar " anything more than the rating I have given it , although I must say that it is a very fine comedy with some great gut-busting laughs , and that any fan of inventive comedy - - Carrey fans or not - - should see this movie . After all , would I lie ? stars . - John Ulmer
430822	1173088	486767	6.0	Funny , but not very funny	Will Ferrell and Molly Shannon were like two peas in a pod on " Saturday Night Live . " They had good chemistry and when they combined forces they could induce plenty of laughs . Of course , Will Ferrell is equally funny without Molly Shannon . " The Best of Molly Shannon " proves it is exactly the opposite for her . Yeah , she's a funny lady , but she pales in comparison to such " SNL " comediennes as Gilda Radner , Jane Curtain , and even Chery Oteri , who is very goofy . Molly Shannon's " Best Of " collection is fine , I suppose , but I didn't laugh that much - - and not nearly as often as I did with Will Ferrell's " Best Of " DVD . Here she plays her most famous ( and mostly original ) characters : Salley O'Malley , Mary Katherine Gallagher , Courtney Love and Anna Nicole Smith ( in a disgusting but funny segment with Ben Affleck ) , among others . But they're never exactly laugh-out-loud funny ; I smiled a few times . I enjoyed some of the gags . But I was only really laughing when Will Ferrell was interacting with Molly . Whether or not they are good films is definitely arguable , but there's a reason that Will Ferrell has been cast in virtually every mainstream Molly Shannon film . They go together . She cameos in his movies , he cameos and / or stars in hers . Remember " Superstar " ? Remember " A Night at the Roxbury " ? Maybe they're not good , but at least Lorne Michaels was smart enough to realize that the two have some sort of chemistry . I noticed that Molly Shannon likes to move around a lot . I watched the Conan O'Brian interview with her ( included on the DVD ) , and she absolutely could not sit still at all , just like her " Joyologist " character , who , in the DVD's outtakes , flipped over her chair from moving around so much . She's good as Courtney Love , and Molly Shannon is undoubtedly a good comedic actress , but to say that she deserves her own collection of best moments at this point in time is a bit presumptuous , especially considering the fact that classic " SNL " actors have yet to appear in any sort of " Best Of " DVD collections . ( Or am I just not finding them on Amazon and in the stores ? ) Besides , most of the compiles sketches aren't even that great - - or is it just that Molly Shannon herself isn't that great ? I hope it's the former . If you're a fan of Molly Shannon and / or " Saturday Night Live , " I would definitely pick up this DVD . I bought it for fourteen dollars , and I've got to say that I'll probably return to it once and a while for some good grins . But not nearly as often as I am already returning to " The Best of Will Ferrell , " which still stands as the best " Saturday Night Live " DVD I own at the current time ( only three , but I'm getting there ) . " Saturday Night Live : The Best of Molly Shannon " runs 76 minutes . It contains outtakes , a deleted dress rehearsal scene , a picture gallery , two TV interviews with Conan , and so on . It is not rated , but contains some language and sexual content / partial nudity . The feature's guest stars include , among others : Val Kilmer , Matthew Broderick , Gabriel Byrne , Tina Turner , Alex Baldwin , et al . It is now available on video and DVD .
431151	1173088	315733	6.0	The nonlinear storytelling is unnecessary and the film as a whole is just so-so	I loved " Memento . " The nonlinear storytelling was key to the story itself and as a result complimented the overall nature of the film ; however , " 21 Grams " features the same style of nonlinear narrative without having an actual point . This movie could just have easily been told in chronological order and it would have had the same effect . In fact , if one were to unravel it and place the scenes in order , I'm sure they'd find nothing to be surprised at : it's a fairly basic drama and the nonlinear elements , I think , are just a way of making it seem cleverer and more important than it actually is . The performances , on the other hand , are superb . Sean Penn is excellent and Naomi Watts delivers her best yet . Benicio Del Toro is quite good as well ( even if his character seemed a bit reminiscent of some earlier ones he'd played ) and I felt sympathy for all three , especially Del Toro , as we realize everything that happened was a result of his trying to be wholesome and " clean . " And it backfired enormously . Overall " 21 Grams " was a rather large disappointment when I saw it as I had heard so much hype about it . I didn't find the storytelling awe-inspiring or important , it just made the film seem showy and artificial , as if they were afraid it wouldn't be able to stand on its own as a motion picture without some type of gimmick . Recommended , but don't expect too much .
431040	1173088	120888	6.0	I recommend you sit down some night , grab a tub of popcorn , and just enjoy this movie for what it is : an instantly forgettable comedy that serves its purpose : a nice night in .	" The Wedding Singer " is a mix between just about any romantic comedy from the eighties that you can find , and an Adam Sandler film . I think that's really enough said . But if you want more detailed details , here ya go . . . Adam Sandler plays Robbie Hart , a failing wedding singer who has just been dumped by his fiance . So as he loses his only job and his to-be wife , Sandler starts to fall in love with the sweet Julia Sullivan ( Drew Barrymore ) , whom is engaged herself to another man . Now Robbie must prove that the man she is about to marry is really a playboy who wants one thing , before it's too late . " The Wedding Singer " is a pleasant enough comedy to enjoy one night , if not a great one . The laughs aren't constant , but there are some . It doesn't rank as high in the laugh category as Sandler's earlier film , " Happy Gilmore , " but it provides just enough sweetness and guffaws to recommend . The movie is filmed with a very eighties-feel , and that is mixed with the humor of Adam Sandler , so it's pretty easy to imagine what the film is going to be like . I recommend you sit down some night , grab a tub of popcorn , and just enjoy this movie for what it is : an instantly forgettable comedy that serves its purpose : a nice night in . stars - John Ulmer
430281	1173088	389860	6.0	Not great comedy - but a fun , lightweight movie that serves its purpose and is thoroughly entertaining	Instantly reminiscent of " It's a Wonderful Life " and " Bruce Almighty , " " Click " is a simplistic and lightweight comedy that serves its purpose as distracting entertainment . It's a typical summer comedy - nothing very deep or meaningful , but humorous with an obvious ( yet admirable ) message behind it . It's another Adam Sandler movie but not quite as crude as some of his others . It reminded me most of " The Wedding Singer " in terms of its humor - it's not as slapstick as some of Sandler's other works - but I actually preferred it to " Wedding Singer . " Sandler plays an average Joe who has trouble balancing time between work and family . He's a rising architect working at a firm for David Hasselhoff ( his casting was a pure stroke of comedic genius - well , it was a good choice , anyway ) and has been assigned to a new Japanese building , which ends up consuming all his time at home and makes him neglect his family . When he ventures to Bed , Bath & Beyond to purchase a universal remote control , he enters the Beyond Department and meets Morty ( Christopher Walken ) , who gives him a true universal remote - a remote control that can control his world . He can pause , fast-forward and rewind his life . With his newfound power Sandler finds time for work and family , but soon the device causes him to skip over too much of his life and before he knows it his kids are teenagers and so on and so forth . The plot is pretty obvious and so is the message - some critics have complained that the film's alternating between basic comedy and meaningful drama ( especially towards the end ) is annoying and off-balance - but I didn't mind it . Sandler is better than usual although not entirely believable as a married man or the husband of Kate Beckinsale ( who is stunning as usual ) . It's really Walken and The Hoff who steal the show - I loved Hoff's sexual harassment speech . ( Hoff : " Now , homosexual harassment . This is , like , when a dude touches another dude at work . " ) Overall , if you think you won't like this you probably won't . It's one of those movies where it meets your expectations - you can tell exactly what it's going to be like from the commercials , and if you think watching a lightweight Adam Sandler comedy for 90 minutes is a waste of time , I wouldn't recommend this to you . However , if you can appreciate the occasional brainless comedy then you'll probably find something worthwhile here . If you liked " Bruce Almighty " this will appeal to you .
430414	1173088	102926	7.0	Inferior to " Se7en " but a good movie - just overrated !	Hannibal . The very name sparks fear , discomfort , and ultimately recognition . He is one of the most popular screen characters of all time , the incarnation of evil , and yet strangely likable despite his distasteful savoring of human flesh . " I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice bottle of chianti , " he tells FBI Agent Clarice Starling ( Jodie Foster ) after she meets him in a prison , metal bars their only means of separation . Their first conversation and face-to-face interaction is a vital element of the film's narrative ; the bars represent Starling's own self-defense ; they have wide-open spaces that are easily penetrable . And Hannibal Lecter , a psychologist and cannibal , knows exactly how to reach past her own mental cell bars and crack into her brain , and he does so in the classic scene where she recalls memories from her childhood , of the lamb she tried to save . . . Agent Starling is on the case of a bizarre serial killer whose victims tend to be young women . Although they are unaware of his motives , it turns out the infamous " Buffalo Bill " is using the skin of these unfortunate victims for his own sick pleasure . He's not the sort of person you'd feel comfortable being stuck next to in an otherwise empty elevator . Clarice is smart , a feminine icon of the movies . Her brains are what propel her own investigation into the case while her desire to unearth the truth and succeed past the results of her male counterparts stems from a sort of egotistical dominance . Not many people comment upon Sterling's own sexuality , her almost overly excessive efforts at saving the victims ( who happen to be females ) . Buffalo Bill seems to represent her own image of men : cruel creatures who inflict pain and suffering upon helpless women . Her sole friend , the only man she can rely on for help and inside tidbits , is an outcast upon society - - a metaphor for the repressed homosexuals who are abandoned by their own societies , shunned by those who feel they are not " normal . " Harris's underlying implications of homosexuality and female dominance in the novel are admittedly stronger than in the film , although the presence of the suggestions is clearly evident under close examination . Or , it could just be about serial killers and FBI agents . You decide . Sure , the movie is famous , but we must ask ourselves whether or not the film's reputation has given it a better face over the year than it has deserved . It is well directed , but never does the film fascinate us as the bold and daring " Se7en " did . " Silence of the Lambs " is a fine film , but pales in comparison to some of its imitators and fellow genre occupants . The acting and writing is not at fault . Hopkins and Foster are superb . Hopkins received the most critical acclaim , although in 2001 we all realized that Foster was a key to the series as well , when she was unsuccessfully replaced with Julianne Moore in the sequel , " Hannibal , " directed by Ridley Scott , which was a total failure and disappointment for the fans of the original and source material , the novels by Thomas Harris , who has reportedly never seen " Silence of the Lambs " for fear that it would influence his writing . " Lambs , " more than any other film in the series , is terribly manipulative , complete with tacky flashbacks that are out of place and all too convenient . That's where the film ultimately fails . The direction by Jonathan Demme is , truth be told , rather poor and borderline mediocre ; Demme does not use cinematography to his advantage , does not use darker tones to evoke feelings from the prints as Fincher did with " Se7en . " It's a great movie with convincing performances and a realistic script packaged in the form of a typical Hollywood thriller - - it might have a good reputation , it might be a good movie , but compared to other classics of the genre , " The Silence of the Lambs " just doesn't hold up as much as I had hoped it would after all these years . It's revolutionary , but isn't the masterpiece it used to be . On the plus side there's always that terrific ending to look forward to .
430007	1173088	281686	7.0	Hail to the king , baby !	Elvis never died . JFK wasn't assassinated . They both live in a retirement home in East Texas . Elvis is seventy years old with a cancerous growth on his penis , and JFK's body has been dyed black . If this sounds odd to you , that's probably because it is . " Bubba Ho-tep " is , quite frankly , the most insanely unique film to emerge in years . Some people will love it , others will hate it . Its humor is quirky , not necessarily laugh-out-loud but rather silly . It is at times scary and at other times simply ludicrous . The plot is insane - an old mummy lost in a bus crash is revived and steals the souls of the living from Elvis ' retirement home . Elvis ( Bruce Campbell ) , still alive , swapped lives with an impersonator years before . He misses his wife and daughter and all the women who used to throw themselves at him . JFK ( Ossie Davis ) also resides at the retirement home under the care of the supervisor ( Reggie Bannister ) , who patronizes them both when they alert him of Bubba Ho-tep killing all the old people . This movie is really stupid , but in a good way . It's all over the place . Like Don Coscarelli's previous famous cult flicks ( namely the " Phantasm " movies ) , it's a mixture of comedy and horror , and for the most part , it works . Campbell doesn't look anything like Elvis really but he's still believable and funny . Ossie Davis never convinces as JFK but he is convincing as a nutcase completely out of his mind . This movie isn't great but it is completely original and a unique mixture of genres . I particularly liked the first half more so than the second half , but as a complete film it still rocks . As Bruce said in another film , " Hail to the king , baby ! "
430027	1173088	101329	7.0	Better than the original	I enjoyed the original " American Tail " movie because of its appeal towards adults as well as children ( it uses mice and cats as a metaphor for the Jews and Germans during WWII , with immigrants fleeing to the US ) . However the dark edge of the movie was a bit too much for me and I felt as a children's tale it was probably a bit too scary . Don Bluth returned in ' 91 to film the sequel to his last hit , this one a satire of the westerns . Fievel the mischievous mouse returns as his parents are shipping off to Green River to escape the cats , led by Cat R . Wall ( voiced by John Cleese ) . Along the way a spider ( voiced by Jon Lovitz ) tries to kill Fievel and he falls off the train , into the desert , where he pines for his feline friend from the first film ( voiced by Dom DeLuise ) . Eventually Fievel finds his way out of the desert and finds a dog-sheriff ( voiced by Jimmy Stewart ) who decides to help train him so that he can fight off Cat R . Wall , who has moved out west to spread his reign of terror . I enjoy this movie more than the first one because it's not as dark ( something I just have a problem with in a kid's movie ) . The satire isn't as strong and the whole WWII edge is lost but it still retains the cats vs . mice , which is a nice element . The animation in my opinion is more classical and the musical sequences are more lively . The voice talents are far more impressive and I love Jimmy Stewart and John Cleese in this movie - talk about great casting ! Overall this is better than the original and it surprises me that more people don't actually know about it . As a nice little family adventure film it's pretty entertaining and in terms of animation it represents everything Don Bluth is known for .
430284	1173088	277027	7.0	A great performance by Sean Penn in a good movie	" I Am Sam " is a film with a main performance stronger than the movie itself . Sean Penn was Oscar-nominated for his role as Sam , a mentally retarded father who hires a savvy lawyer ( Michelle Pfeiffer ) to represent him in a custody trial involving his daughter ( Dakota Fanning ) . The courts think Sam isn't fit to be a father due to his mental limitations , but Sam feels otherwise . As Pfeiffer begins representing Sam she realizes he is a good father and feels an emotional attachment to the case that she hasn't experienced when dealing with criminals and the sort . This film came out and received generally negative reviews in 2001 , which I was surprised at considering it's an enjoyable movie . The performances are admittedly much stronger than the actual film ( which has kind of been done in the past ) - Penn deserved his Oscar nom and Pfeiffer is strong and perfect for the role of a lawyer . If you're a fan of the actors you should watch this , but if you don't like Penn or Pfeiffer you should be more reluctant since it's basically a performance film .
429688	1173088	119978	7.0	A good film with great performances	This was one of Matt Damon's early performances that really helped separate him from Affleck in the acting department . He plays Rudy Baylor , a law school student who ( with the help of Danny DeVito's character ) tries to take on the bad guys of conglomerate America . I read the novel by John Grisham , a writer who has never really impressed me very much in terms of characterization ( if you'll notice all his protagonists are almost identical ) but the movie has solid performances that help define everyone . Damon is impressive , and Mickey Rourke ( in his third pairing with Francis Ford Coppola ) turns in a short but memorable performance as a corrupt and ignorant man . Overall this may not be great but the performances are , and it was one of Coppola's few good films from the 1990s .
429427	1173088	276751	7.0	Good , But Took Quite a While to Get to Where it Was Going . . .	" About a Boy " Hugh Grant has been considered for the next James Bond according to a certain film magazine . Well , I for one forsee the downfall of James Bond as we know it . The considerations are a black actor , Hugh Grant , Christian Bale , and Jude Law , not to mention another black actor : Will Smith . Yes , you read that right . Apart from black actors - - really , Bond being black ? - - Hugh Grant is probably the worst choice for Bond . But as far as romantic comedies go , he's not that bad . " About a Boy " is about a childish , whiny , selfish , greedy , miserable young man ( Grant ) who finds that single parents are best for dating . So he enters into a single parents group , where he proceeds to tell the lie that he has a child . Soon , he is going out with a woman who believes he has a son - - who introduces him to a friend's pre-teen , named Marcus . Marcus ' mother attempts to commit suicide , and it screws up the kid , so he starts to go over to Grant's home every day after school . Grant eventually admits he has no child , and the woman he had been going out with pretty much dumps him . But Marcus keeps coming over every day . Eventually Grant starts to help Marcus out by trying to help him fit into his school better ; he buys him " trainers , " CDs , a personal CD player , etc . And then Grant's character meets Rachel ( Rachel Weisz ) , who he proceeds to tell that he has a son , for certain reasons . So eventually Rachel wants to see his son . Trouble . And then Grant gets Marcus to pose as his son while he gets personal with Rachel . Trouble solved . For now . " About a Boy " is based on the bestselling novel by Nicholas Hornby , author of " High Fidelity " - - which was turned into a film with John Cusack that took place in Chicago instead of London - - and a few other hits . I've never read his work , but I think it's been done justice for the most part . " About a Boy " is a good comedy , with some funny British humor . It was good , but not great . I enjoyed " Notting Hill " more , to tell you the truth . I think " About a Boy " took quite a long time getting to where it was going . Ranking in at about two hours , that's a bit long for a romantic comedy , especially when the love interest is introduced an hour and nine minutes into the film . The setup itself takes over an hour to establish . Many , many scenes could have been cut to make room for more time after Grant meets Rachel . But instead , the filmmakers take so much time building up to that point , that by the time they finally arrive to the romance part , they have about fifty minutes to deal with a LOT of things that happen . Perhaps that is why the last hour seems so rushed and thrown together compared to the beginning . But it's still a pretty funny film . I'm not especially fond of Hugh Grant , but his romantic comedies can be pretty good - - I really enjoyed " Notting Hill , " and I don't like Roberts , either . " The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain " was also a good British comedy . And there's no doubting " About a Boy " is good , but it's not great , and a lot of scenes could and should have been cut . Isn't it ironic that I think one of the deleted scenes on the DVD should have been left in the film ? Stars - - or Stars - - John Ulmer
430952	1173088	427944	7.0	A witty satire that doesn't take sides on the smoking controversy .	A clever satire of the spin-world ( thanks largely to its cast and a witty script by Jason Reitman ) , Thank You For Smoking comes on like Wag the Dog via The Insider ? it's a painfully honest insight into the tobacco industry , led by the narration of Nick Naylor ( Aaron Eckhart ) , the Big Tobacco corporation's chief spokesman . His narcissistic self-infatuation ( " Charles Manson kills people ; I talk . " ) and sleazy tactics land him in trouble when he finds himself bribing a lung cancer victim in front of his pre-teen son , who is not yet old enough to smoke but is being influenced by his money-driven father . Nick has a lot on his mind . He's got pressure from an anti-smoking Senator ( played brilliantly by William H . Macy ) , his boss , his ex-wife , fanatical groups on homicidal missions , a double-crossing reporter ( Katie Holmes ) and a Hollywood producer ( Rob Lowe ) trying to cast the perfect Hollywood glamorization of smoking ( Brad Pitt and Catherine Zeta-Jones are offered as the leads ) . The movie , directed by the son of Ivan Reitman ( the " Ghosbusters " director / producer extraordinaire ) , balances absurdity with realism ; moments of the film come across as poignant reflection while following scenes are completely the opposite . This balance is thrown off a bit sometimes ? David Koechner's portrayal of an NRA lobbyist is great but feels out of place , as if it belongs in a comedy in the vein of " Anchorman . " And ultimately this uneven mix of the deadly serious ( literally ) with off-the-wall gags does catch up with the film ; it eventually falls back upon its very strong script , which supports it ( a lesser film might be affected more drastically with a weaker screenplay ) , but some scenes probably should have been toned down a bit to comply with the subtler and more realistic scenes . For what it's worth , the wacky scenes are extremely hilarious , but they seem to contradict other portions of the material . Jason is a better director than his father , though , and shows a lot of potential here : I'd say the direction is almost deserving of a more serious film . I'd love to see what he could do with a drama in the future . The movie also boasts an excellent lead performance by Aaron Eckhart , who oozes with sleaze , greed , corruption and a hidden sense of morals . He knows what he is doing is wrong , but he's not a stereotypical Hollywood motion picture " good guy " ? even the closing of the picture , without spoiling it , isn't the moralistic cop-out I had expected ; the movie isn't a black-and-white painting of the smoking controversy ; it doesn't take sides on either side of the debate . This is really being marketed incorrectly as the next " 40-Year-Old Virgin " right now , but the film ? for the most part , anyway ? really isn't as hilarious as it is thought-provoking and engaging . Apart from a few aforementioned moments of utter absurdity , the majority of the film's duration involves some pretty serious topics , and it handles them well . It's not a bust-your-gut-funny movie , and it's perhaps not as strong as some reviews would lead you to believe , but it's one of the better satires in recent memory and certainly one of the more effective since Wag the Dog .
429676	1173088	83000	7.0	Very likable Hitchcockian thriller from the director of " Psycho II " . . .	It's amazing how many pleasant treats you'll find on TV Friday nights at one o'clock in the morning . Take " Roadgames " ( or " Road Games " ) for example : The Hitchcockian story of a trucker delivering meat across Australia who becomes entangled in a possible mystery involving an unapprehensible serial killer who may or may not have murdered a helpless hitchhiker traveling the roads he's driving on . Often referred to as " Rear Window " on the road , self-proclaimed Hitchcock enthusiast Richard Franklin has directed a quaint , low-budget thriller with a likable ( although quite unusual ) lead actor in the role of Frustrated Hero . Pat Quid ( Stacy Keach - - who is indeed a man ) is driving across Australia in a meat truck when he thinks he's noticed a strange happening - - a man in a van seems to be burying a bag in the middle of a desert in Australia , and when he is noticed he climbs back into his blue van and speeds away into the distance . Pat puts this event into the back of his mind when he decides against regulations to pick up a wandering hitchhiker named Pam Rushworth ( Jamie Lee Curtis ) , who has run away from home in an effort to escape her famous father's life . The two bond together on the road and have some fun playing various games - - until she is kidnapped by the same strange man in a van . At first , Pat thinks he's just being paranoid - - he even starts to think that Pam left him for the man . But then he realizes that Pam has indeed been kidnapped , and he suspects that the strange man in the van might be a notorious serial killer who has been killing young women and scattering their body parts miles apart from each other . After the police offer no help , Pat takes matters into his own hands and sets off on a quest to bring back Pam to safety and apprehend the killer before he can strike again . Some twists and turns ensue , although nothing very surprising . If this were a mainstream horror film with an overblown budget and big-name actors , I'd probably give " Roadgames " a bad rating . But this is the type of pleasant , likable low-budget thriller that is easy to watch and knows it's nothing more than a shadow of greater film noir mysteries / thrillers like " Rear Window " or " The Third Man " - - the type of film that thrusts its hero on a one-man venture into the heart of darkness in order to find out the truth . Stacy Keach is strikingly likable as the lonely trucker who talks to his own pet dingo as he drives along , contemplating all types of conspiracy theories about serial killers and mysteries . What could definitely become tiring - - listening to a man talk to his dingo for the majority of a movie , that is - - actually becomes quite fun . Keach is funny , nice , and just . . . likable ! Too bad his career was put on hold years later after he got arrested for smuggling cocaine . . . The director , Richard Franklin , is a huge Hitchcock fan - - and it shows . This film is like a sort of remake of " Rear Window " and other such mystery-thrillers . It's loads of fun and an easy watch . ( Trivia note : Franklin directed " Psycho II , " the sequel to Hitchcock's 1960 classic original . ) I can definitely say that this film is most like " Breakdown , " the Jonathan Mostow movie starring Kurt Russell as a man who loses his wife to a trucker and tries to get her back , even though there seems to be no evidence of her disappearance . But unlike the great " Breakdown , " this film doesn't wither away in the second half and turn into a disappointing movie - - it remains strong throughout , and yes , it has plenty of nods towards Hitchcock . ( Check out the magazines Curtis starts sorting through - - there he is ! ) stars . - John Ulmer
429683	1173088	303350	7.0	Commendable effort	This was nominated in the Best Foreign Picture category of the Oscars for 2001 . I don't think it's great , but it is quite good . A nasty white slave owner forces an African boy into putting a young puppy in a bag . He then kicks the bag , and forces the African boy to open the bag , so that the dog will never trust the slaves again . At the end of the movie , the slave boy witnesses the owner dying of a heart attack . He is going to fetch pills , but the dog gets in his way , defending the master . The boy has to choose whether to save his own life or risk it to save the old man . Sad ? Yes . The ending in particular . But if you can manage to sit through the scene of intense animal cruelty ( of course it wasn't real , it's the most realistic-LOOKING beating I've ever seen an animal take in a film before ) it's worth it .
429914	1173088	387412	7.0	An insightful documentary	" Metallica : Some Kind of Monster " is a mega documentary covering the band's lengthy recording process for their next album , " St . Anger . " Metallica , as if you didn't know by now , is the " . . . world's most popular heavy metal band . " They've got a worldwide cult followings and sell the most rock T-shirts along with The Doors , AC / DC , Led Zeppelin , Guns N ' Roses and , of course , The Beatles . ( I gather this statistic from a trustworthy source - my estimations . Har . Har . ) I don't like Metallica very much , my favorite work of theirs was the Black Album and . . . And Justice For All . The best has to be their live S & M performance with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra . As a result watching this documentary I had no reason to be impressed - I'm not a biased fan , I'm not even what you might call an interested viewer . But it caught my interest for the most part . The band seems rather stupid as a whole - the lead singer at one point asks another bandmate what the word " mission " means , and he's serious - and so is the guitarist when he replies . " It's , like , a goal , " he says . Okay , right . The recording process is really long and the band gets themselves into all sorts of fights , physical and verbal . ( But mostly verbal . ) The bass player Jason leaves early on and is replaced by Ozzy's ex-bass player , which was one of the cooler parts of the documentary , and something rarely seen . Overall this is a bit too long and definitely caters more towards Metallica fans . I also felt as if Metallica has been way over-exposed lately and they're not totally deserving of all their praise . I also don't like most of the bandmembers personally - they strike me as unlikable and dumb . ( Except for the drummer , who ironically is shot down the most by his peers when giving his opinion . ) Needless to say if you love Metallica you'll love this - if you don't , it's still a pretty cool glimpse into the downside of rock n ' roll .
430031	1173088	92699	7.0	Clever , witty and funny	James L . Brook is one of those directors who always seems to take a quirky look at life . He isn't only the producer for " The Simpsons , " he has some classic comedies under his belt - - " Broadcast News " is one of them . Although it doesn't match his later effort " As Good As It Gets , " " Broadcast News " is still a very clever , funny and witty movie about a television broadcasting station and all the problems they suffer . There's a great comedic sequence of physical humor where Joan Cusack is running around the building trying to rush a news tape to the editing room in a matter of mere minutes before it is to be broadcast live on TV . This isn't only very truthful in terms of how hectic broadcasting stations are operated , but also a skillful and honest portrayal of human beings . A low-key , subtle movie with good acting ( especially from Hurt , who I don't always like so much ) and apt direction .
430625	1173088	112817	8.0	The " Apocalypse Now " of the 1990s	The critics really took a beating on " Dead Man " when it came out . I remember not hearing much about the film until just recently , and I looked up some critics ' reviews and was surprised to see some exceedingly positive , and others unbelievably low , filled with venemous hatred for the film . After seeing the film , I can understand why . You either love it or hate it ; " get it " or " don't get it . " I think I got it . Or , at least , I appreciated it . Yes , it does get quite long at times . Yes , it's pretentious . A bit _ too _ pretentious at times , maybe . But it's still a very unique , interesting twist on the western motion picture formula with solid direction , excellent performances and a killer soundtrack by Neil Young . ( It's eerie and fits the mood and tone of the movie perfectly . ) The story follows a man named William Blake ( Johnny Depp ) who , at the turn of the 20th century , ventures by train to a deserted town in search of a stable job . When he arrives , he finds out the position has already been fulfilled , and he is left helpless , eventually falling into the arms of a local prostitute . Later that night , her boyfriend ( Gabriel Byrne ) returns home , finds them in bed together , and shoots them both , killing the woman and injuring Blake . Blake returns fire , kills the man , and flees into the night , waking up in the arms of an Indian who nurses him back to health . Meanwhile the man's father ( the late Robert Mitchum in his final screen performance ) sends a group of hired killers ( led by Lance Henriksen ) after Blake , who is mistakenly assumed by the Indian to be the famous poet of the same name . Jim Jarmusch's western twist instantly reminded me of " Apocalypse Now , " not just through its theatrical style and scope but also because of its critical reaction . If you'll recall , " Apocalypse Now " received very mixed review upon its initial release , and was condemned for being pretentious and overly-artsy - - just like " Dead Man . " And like " Dead Man , " each year it seemingly gains new loyal fans who have boosted it into the realm of masterpiece . Now the critics love " Apocalypse Now . " It makes me wonder what they'll think of " Dead Man " in thirty years . There are some flaws , though . As I pointed out before , Jarmush does act a bit pretentious behind the camera sometimes . Although as a film buff I enjoyed the opening sequence , it does go on too long , and doesn't make much sense . It's sort of bizarre for the sake of being bizarre at times . ( And this method continues throughout the entire picture . ) The huge cast is filled with eye-popping cameos ( just like " Apocalypse " ) and this is both for better and for worse . Johnny Depp is excellent in the lead role . The movie takes on a hallucinogenic quality so everything is rather distorted , including his performance . It's distant and watered , his behavior rippling . Depp nails it . The political correctness of the film is something " Apocalypse " avoided - - for example the black gunslinger . Just from a historical perspective , it would never have been . Also , they didn't wear braided hair back then . Some of the " modernized " elements of the film were a bit unwelcomed , ruining the historical aspect . ( And I'm not just referencing ethnicity , I'm referencing modernizing elements of the story in general , and the time period . ) Overall I do think this film is quite misunderstood by a majority of regular filmgoers , and the critics bagged on it too heavily when it first came out . But evidently , judging from its impressive standing on IMDb , some people have " got it " and the movie is at least creating some sort of effect after all these years . I just liked it because it's a unique film , and I respect that in any movie made nowadays .

430041	1173088	70047	8.0	Surprisingly dated in most areas , but still as disturbing as it was in 1973 . . .	William Friedkin's " The Exorcist " is disturbing , scary and ultimately haunting at the same time . Viewing it now , in 2003 , it seems a bit dated in some areas - - but the film's gruesome depictions of possession are still as horrifying as then . Part of the fear , I think , is because it's so real . Let's face it , as scary as Norman Bates ( or Freddy Krueger , for newer generations ) may be , the chances of him walking into your house and repeatedly stabbing you are slim . But if you believe in any sort of religion , obviously you believe in God , Satan , demons , or some of the above . And , if you want to take it a step further , the Bible itself says demons are all around us , invisible to the eye and some , almost definitely , incarnate . Scary , huh ? Stories of demons , ghosts , and so on go back thousands of years . They've always given me the creeps , mainly because the supernatural is a whole other universe . There are no human boundaries for those from the parallel universe , if you believe in such things . I come from a Christian upbringing . Whether you have religion or not , it's still disturbing - - but if you do have faith it's all the more terrifying . I don't know if you do , but watching " The Exorcist " with faith sure will scare the bejeezes out of you . Chris MacNeil ( Ellen Burstyn ) is a struggling actress raising her twelve-year-old daughter , Regan ( Linda Blair ) , all by herself . Her husband has left her and refuses to speak with Regan , even on her 12th birthday . Regan has been experiencing some mild disturbances lately , ranging from her bed shaking to speaking evil and / or hurtful sentences to close friends and family . And so the realization finally hits that a demon has possessed Regan . Satan himself , supposedly , though it could just be a demon claiming to be Satan . He terrorizes the girl's body and inflicts harm . Regan turns into a beast - - she has no idea what she's saying or doing . Her soul is still in the body somewhere . . . but the demon has completely taken control . And so an exorcism takes place , held by two priests , one of whom ( Jason Miller ) has recently started to lose his faith after the death of his elderly mother , and one of whom is a sort of legendary figure ( Max Von Sydow ) . Will they be able to rid the demon from Regan's body ? When " The Exorcist " came out in 1973 , it scared everyone . Audiences held their breath . There are reports of movie-goers passing out in their seats . One man is rumored to have sued Warner Bros . because the film caused him to faint and hit his head on the edge of the seat in front of him . All this because of one horrifying film . Even stranger are the rumors of deaths on and off the set - - the character of Burke Dennings , played by the famous Irish actor , died on location during filming , and so the author of the novel and script , William Peter Blatty , had to go back and make revisions . He and director William Friedkin eventually decided that the best thing to do would be killing off his character early on . It worked , and it only added a more evil overtone to the movie , and it really let the audience know that the demon wasn't just mean - - it was homicidal . Other such rumors have been reported on the Steven Spielberg produced " Poltergeist . " Many of the cast members later died in odd cases . Perhaps it's a subtle message that we're not dealing with something to be taken lightly . Luckily , no one watching the movie did . " The Exorcist " has dated in its past thirty years , yes , but the horrific possession scenes are still as gut-wrenchingly disturbing as they were back in ' 73 . Hard to imagine that a film so gory and sickening was made prior to some of the teen flicks available on the market nowadays . But , if there's one thing you can credit " The Exorcist " for , it's that it isn't another teen slasher movie . This is an intelligent and surprisingly disturbing horror film . Some films , specifically those that are set in an unspecified year , date very well . " The Exorcist , " in my opinion , hasn't dated quite as well as one would hope . But the scenes that everyone remembers , the scenes that really scare people , are just as terrifying as they were thirty years ago . And so , in that sense , the film hasn't dated at all . stars . - John Ulmer
429957	1173088	122151	8.0	One Of the Rare Franchises That Never Gets Too Overbearing and Dull . . .	Lethal Weapon 4 starts out with a boring and ridiculous beginning . I remember watching it the first time and thinking , " oh no , another bad sequel . " However , once past the first ten minutes , the film starts to pick up its pace and retreat into familiar Lethal Weapon style . Just like film 2 and 3 , Lethal Weapon 4 isn't as good as the original , but it never gets to the point of unbearable . It is quite entertaining and fun to watch , with some very great actors , that have some very great chemistry between each other . Mel Gibson and Danny Glover fit like a glove , and Joe Pesci is perfect as the comedy relief , not being like the recent " side kicks " we always see , that are so obnoxious we want to punch them . Mr . Pesci is a very talented actor , and he always makes me laugh , whether it's Lethal Weapon 4 or Raging Bull and Casino . Rene Russo provides Mel's love interest yet again , and though I found the marriage thing a bit of a throw-in , it was still good for the story . It provided some laughs at the end of the film . Chris Rock stars in one role where his character is not completely annoying or loudmouthed , mainly because he wasn't extremely famous yet , and had only been on SNL and a few small roles in film . . . Joes Pesci and him throw back and forth a few insults and jokes , and bounce off each other , which helps me welcom Rock a bit more . Jet Li's first American film , I believe , proves he can be a quite and intriguing character , which later helped him get roles in films like Kiss of teh Dragon and The One . Another thing about this franchise is that director Richard Donner directed all four films , and it's always good to use the original director for a sequel , rather than a lesser director , as we have countless examples of . ( especially horror films ! ) From the opening jazz music we have come to love , Lethal Weapon provides enough entertainment and fun to keep one entertained , and it's definitely worth watching . I hope they stop while they're ahead , and do not make another Lethal Weapon film , because it's rare for a film series to still be entertaining and imaginitive after these many sequels . stars-JOHN ULMER
430347	1173088	92099	8.0	Fun to watch - for all the wrong reasons	This was one of the earliest cases of the 1980s Hollywood Blockbuster . Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer ( also responsible for the 1984 popular culture smash hit " Beverly Hills Cop " ) struck gold with " Top Gun " and it helped define what most people remember about the era - mainly cheesy soundtracks , unbelievably good-looking people playing ordinary everyday roles , stupid romantic subplots and a lot of bad action sequences . " Top Gun " is a fun film to watch . Ignoring its homosexual undercurrents everybody loves to make fun of ( it was humorous the first ten times I heard about the so-called " blatant references " ) - the movie is simply so cheesy it's a win-win situation ! People with no taste will think it's a brilliant film , whereas others will savor its stupidity . Kelly McGillis as a flight instructor for the NAVY is icing on the cake when it comes to utter disbelief . In reality she would be a he : a 50-something retiree , balding , with a big fat beer belly , always wearing a crusty Navy baseball cap ( sort of like Tom Clancy ) . But no , in " Top Gun , " everybody's beautiful - and the love scene between Maverick ( Tom Cruise ) and McGillis is the equivalent of a perfume commercial . Tony Scott is out of his mind . I love this movie .
430375	1173088	484855	8.0	Carlin's most bitter and scorching stand up yet	Many people on both this site and Amazon have claimed that " Life is Worth Losing " is George Carlin's worst comedy performance . One reviewer claims he has simply turned into a bitter misanthrope - but I don't think that's very fair . I thought " Life is Worth Losing " was indeed one of Carlin's harshest acts , but it was also very funny . His opening , " Modern Man , " is a four-minute mind-bending string of words ( similar to the opening of " Complaints and Grievances " ) which is hilarious and almost unbelievable - whoever hears this and thinks Carlin is " losing it " must be kidding ! After this he begins dissecting American life and basically thrashing about the people of our nation with his words - labeling Americans as fat , mall-loving idiots . And some might be offended by this , but that's why he's George Carlin . Carlin may be getting older but I really fail to see how he's " falling apart " as a comedian here - I thought it was a great show and although it's his most bitter act I've heard , a lot of it is also totally true .
431154	1173088	90863	8.0	Fast Eddie is back !	People misunderstood " The Color of Money , " I think . There are a few things to keep in mind : 1 ) This was a Martin Scorsese film . Scorsese was fresh off " Taxi Driver , " " Raging Bull , " and other such successes from less than a decade before . People were expecting a lot . 2 ) It starred Paul Newman , returning to his character from " The Hustler , " in a sequel that was twenty-five years in the making . That's longer than the wait for the " Phantom Menace " prequel . Perhaps for those two ( very strong ) reasons alone , when " The Color of Money " opened in 1986 , the critics and audiences didn't think much of it . It garnered decent praise from both areas but most critics seemed to agree : it didn't hold a candle to " The Hustler , " and anyone other than Scorsese could have easily made the same picture . After 19 years , I disagree . I think " The Color of Money " is not only an intelligent and amusing character piece , but an excellent continuation of a character we haven't seen for 25 years . First of all , Scorsese's direction isn't his best , but it's still very good . And he's definitely got the same elements going on as " After Hours " from a few years before - - his cinematography is identical and the dark colors and grainy ' 80s vibe are present in every frame . Likewise he's using the quick-cuts and zooms and iconic panning shots that he's known for . The thing is , Scorsese's styles just changed a bit during the 1980s ( they even carried on into " GoodFellas " - - the night-time shots carry the same foreboding look as " After Hours " and " Color of Money " ) . I think now , looking back , since we've seen more of Scorsese's films , it's easier to notice that this is indeed a Martin Scorsese film . A man who is constantly changing his directorial approach . ( Just look at " The Aviator " for goodness sake ! ) Newman deserved the Oscar more for " The Hustler , " of course , but for what it's worth , Fast Eddie Felson's evolution is handled with care in the script and it's very entertaining ( for anyone who's seen the original ) to note the change in his behavior . It's also interesting to see the new cocky pool hustler , Vince ( Tom Cruise ) , filling in the shoes of Eddie from a few decades before . If " The Hustler " was a great insight into the life of a troubled young man , then " The Color of Money " is a terrific insight into the evolution of this man , and the contrast between the young and the old . All adults tell us as children that they were just like us at one time , and we don't believe them . " The Color of Money " follows this principal - - in thirty years , we all know Vince will be just like Fast Eddie : wise and matured . And then he'll probably be coaching a young guy who thinks he's the king of the world . Will they make another sequel based on this continuation of the story ? I doubt it . It's unnecessary , because as far as I'm concerned " The Color of Money " has already stressed the point . But you never know . . . Overall this isn't a great movie and I won't pretend it is . But I do think it's one of the better films to come out of the 1980s and had a lot more going for it than some of the critics gave it credit for . Film buffs should see it , especially those who loved " The Hustler . "
429964	1173088	840305	8.0	Take note , Chevy Chase - this is how you accept a proper roasting !	Although I have not personally seen the entire program , I have heard from numerous sources that the " N . Y . Friars Roast of Chevy Chase " broadcast on Comedy Central a few years ago was such a disaster that even Comedy Central acknowledged its failure and vowed never to air it on television again . So far they have apparently kept to their promise . Part of the reason the show was so horrendous was apparently due to the fact that the roast's subject , Mr . Chase , did not approve of the jokes targeting his career . He was also upset that none of his old " friends " from his " SNL " days had shown up ( except for one or two no-names who never found a career outside of the program ) - the same " friends " of Chevy that later voted him as the least-liked cast member in the history of " SNL . " Now , I hold nothing against Chevy Chase . He's pretty funny ( well , was , anyway ) in those ' 80s comedy like " Vacation " and " Caddyshack . " But from what I've seen of the program he really didn't understand the concept at all . William Shatner , on the other hand , takes the extreme criticism in stride . He's a good sport all through this roast - some of the jokes are truly brutal , ranging from verbal jabs at his alleged hairpiece to his singing career and of course his infamous acting chops . Shatner's good humor surrounding the entire ordeal elevates this program - because I'm sure I would have felt less content to laugh along with all the jokes if Shatner had thrown a Chevy Chase and been a jerk about it . This isn't quite as good as last year's Pamela Anderson roast , I must say . Overall the jokes are tamer ( excluding some crude references to a gay " Star Trek " castmember and his private activities , so to speak ) - which isn't necessarily a bad thing , but I felt as though a lot of the dirtier stuff had been cut out . This doesn't bother me as much as the fact that the cuts were made fairly obvious . No doubt Comedy Central will feature some type of " Uncut " DVD in the future with bonus material " too raunchy for television . " Plus , I absolutely HATED the fact that they cut numerous roasters ' speeches short . I understand there were time constraints , but the first one who should have been axed was Farrah Fawcett , whose speech was absolutely horrid . Apparently trying to make fun of her notorious Letterman appearance from a few years back , it quickly dissolved into another case of a joke falling victim to its own subject - she was wasted out of her mind ! She completely messed up her jokes , kept turning away from the microphone ( making it hard to hear what she was saying ) , and just generally ruined the vibe of the entire thing . The audience members ( including Carrie Fisher , who gets stabbed with jokes a few times linked to her weight gain ) were straining to laugh . Instead , I would have FAR preferred to see comedy genius Fred Willard's speech . They decided to cut it short and give us probably less than a minute or so of what he actually said when the show was recorded last week . Willard is such a fine , dry comedian - chances are his jokes just weren't understood by the editors of this show , who are obviously in favor of the more obvious , deliberately crude material . Basically the whole thing about the gay Star Trek member was funny the first few dozen times , but it's akin to Pam Anderson's boob jokes from last year getting old - enough is enough . Not that I'm complaining , but Andy Dick and Kevin Pollak were also cut short ( I could go without hearing Dick's entire routine , I admit ) - and the editing is more choppy than last year's roast , resulting in noticeable skips - as if the editors selected the " best " of each roaster and spliced it together . But these flaws aside , the show WAS very funny . I laughed my head off when Ben Stiller appeared in a pre-recorded roast to Shatner . Unexpected and hilarious , Stiller's was one of my favorite segments of the entire program ! Jason Alexander was a surprisingly good host , although he seemed a bit hesitative and unsure at times . Overall I think I preferred Kimmel's more cynical presentation from last year's , but again , it's a minor complaint . Overall if you're a fan of these roasts you'll love this . There are some great moments such as the Shatner music flashbacks - including video pieces from his infamous " Rocket Man " performance from years ago . Shatner takes it all in stride and comes across as a really nice , likable guy - even after all is said and done he gets up and delivers a tongue-in-cheek roast to himself . This may not be quite as unexpected , irreverent or downright hilarious as the Pamela Anderson roast , but just barely . My only complaints , as I mentioned above , were the editing choices , really - apart from that , it was another job well done on Comedy Central's behalf ! As an aside , I'd really love to see " The Roast of David Hasselhoff " next year . NO ONE deserves a roast as much as this guy does . So I'll have my fingers crossed for the next year , I suppose .
429436	1173088	77362	8.0	One of the best Vietnam films	Sally ( Jane Fonda ) has a husband fighting in Vietnam and she feels optimistic about American involvement there . However she works at a hospital as a nurse and soon becomes caretaker of a bitter war veteran named Luke ( Jon Voight ) . At first , she is repelled by him - but over time grows to love him and admires his cause . ( Luke feels the Vietnam War is a mistake and that countless innocent lives are being pointlessly lost . ) " Coming Home " is the quintessential Vietnam War film - it's anti-war , pessimistic , gritty , depressing , and ultimately sort of whining . Some Vietnam films to go a bit overboard on the " tears for the poor souls " stuff and become very politically correct - " Coming Home " is like this and that might turn some viewers off . However I thought the plot , characters , directing and writing were all interesting . Hal Ashby ( " Shampoo " ) shows talent behind the camera and Jon Voight and Jane Fonda display chemistry in front of it . I'm not typically a fan of Voight ( or even Fonda to be honest ) but they both do a good job here . Voight's final rousing speech to the classroom of students at the movie is simultaneously touching and uplifting . And the love scene is handled with care and doesn't seem gratuitous or unnecessary . " Coming Home " may have its flaws , but I think it's one of the better " Vietnam movies " to come out of the era . You should see it if you enjoyed " The Deer Hunter " or " Platoon . "
430933	1173088	118798	8.0	Very clever , very funny political satire .	Two great political satires came out around the same time as each other - " Bulworth " and " Wag the Dog . " Both received praise from critics but it was " Bulworth " that received more award nominations . . . personally I think they're both equally poignant but you can't win ' em all . Warren Beatty writes , directs and stars in this movie about a bitter and exasperated liberal Democrat candidate who suddenly breaks down and decides to " tell it like it is . " He goes on radio talk shows candidly discussing taboo matters such as sex and racism , seemingly alienating his audience . . . however when the polls come in it turns out the public feels more comfortable with an honest politician than a dishonest one - and Bulworth becomes very popular , especially with the younger crowds . Watching a sixty-something Warren Beatty dressed up in bling-bling rapping like a black man in a movie might sound like a really lame idea for a simple joke . . . and honestly when I saw the ads for this film I originally thought , " Dear god , the Wayans Brothers have gotten to Beatty too . " It looked like something out of a " Scary Movie " . . . umm . . . movie . Anyway , it was a lot better than I thought . Halle Berry ( pre-Oscar , pre-long-acceptance-speech ) stars as Beatty's potential love interest ( ! ) in the film . Bulworth hits on her at a race-separated club in the slums of the city . . . kind of a funny scene . The best thing about this movie is its bitter , cynical treatment of politics . As a true cynical at heart I found this quite irreverent and funny and have to admit - Beatty , as much as I don't like him , is damned funny .
430162	1173088	120483	9.0	You have to experience it . . .	Great spy-spoof of Hitchcock's classic 1930s film ( remade in the 50s ) in title only involving an American tourist ( Bill Murray ) getting put in a fake spy program by his frustrated brother ( Peter Gallagher ) , who only wants peace and quiet . The catch : He gets caught up in a real spy scandal , mistaken for a top secret American operative working undercover in Britain . Having lived in London for most of my life , moving back and forth twice from England to America , this movie is a fun culture clash comedy that uses one of comedy's dryest , funniest personalities to its advantage . Lots of fun , slightly ruined by a madcap ending that , in retrospect , actually seems quite pleasant and enjoyable . stars . - John Ulmer
430028	1173088	38975	9.0	A beautiful film	" The Spiral Staircase " starts off with an afflicted woman being murdered , and right from the onset I was surprised at how explicit it was for its time - by today's standards it's nothing you don't see every day on television , but 1946 was a very different time . It then moves onwards and we are introduced to a young woman who is mute and lives in a mansion with a long , spiraling staircase . ( Hint : this pays off later in the movie . ) When it's made known that a killer is making his rounds murdering afflicted women , the owner of the mansion fears for the mute woman's life - and after a string of more murders occur they realize she's next . RKO's picture was far ahead of its time . Someone on here said it's not a film noir and commanded that people stop calling it one . I'll disagree . I think it IS film noir , in the sense that it's a personal struggle for one person who's surrounded by death and murder . I don't think it should be left up to one person to decide what " film noir " really means . I do think there are limits of course ( " Batman Returns " is NOT film noir , it just tries to come across as one ) but no one should say , " This isn't a film noir because it's a thriller . " So what ? Loads of film noirs are thrillers . I personally feel the stylings , the themes and the motif of the movie could be classified as " film noir . " It's a beautiful movie to look at , very well filmed , and the ending is probably one of the best I can remember ever seeing . It's had a few remakes over the years , but the first remains the best - by a long shot . Highly recommended .
430015	1173088	23969	9.0	Yes , it lives up to its reputation	Probably the Marx Brothers ' most famous comedy , " Duck Soup " is a hilarious and wacky slapstick comedy that even manages to take a stab at politics . Groucho plays Rufus Firefly , who is appointed the new president of Freedonia . He has a dubious stance on work ethic and attempts to cut work hours by reducing the length of employee lunch breaks . Mrs . Teasdale , who has donated twenty million dollars to the failing country , becomes the object of affection for Rufus , who has to battle for her hand against Ambassador Trentino of the neighboring country Sylvania . Soon their tumult escalates and war is declared between the two countries . Most people who comment on this film seem to indicate that they saw it at a very young age and have grown up with it . I can honestly say I wasn't given the opportunity to ever see it until recently , when I finally managed to watch it on Turner Classic Movies , completely uninterrupted . Although it is not consistently laugh-out-loud , tears-in-your-eyes hilarious , " Duck Soup " is very funny - and not quite as outrageous as I had expected . There's a lot going on here , aside from silly physical humor . The Marx Brothers are great as usual and as usual Groucho steals the show . Ultimately if you've never seen this , you need to go rent it out right now . If you have seen it , you already know how great it is and why it deserves its reputation as one of the most beloved comedies ever made .
429736	1173088	53221	9.0	A classic with a few minor flaws .	Yep , all you " Pulp Fiction " junkies can rush out to the DVD stores - this is one of Quentin Tarantino's " top three " favorite films , along with " Taxi Driver " and " Blow Out . " Slightly irreverent top favorites , I'd say , except for " Driver . " This was basically loosely remade by John Carpenter in 1976 with ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 , which was much faster-moving and an excellent film , but this one is also rather terrific , if slower . ( Which , in this case , is a good thing . ) A sheriff in a small town in southwest Texas must keep custody of a murderer whose brother is trying to help him escape . After a friend is killed trying to muster support for him , he and his deputies - a disgraced drunk and a cantankerous old cripple - must find a way to hold out against the rancher's hired guns until the marshal arrives . In the meantime , matters are complicated by the presence of a young gunslinger - and a mysterious beauty who just came in on the last stagecoach . I wouldn't say this is one of THE favorite films of mine but it is a great film that set the course for many to follow - expertly directed by Hawks and all-around an influential , enjoyable semi-masterpiece .
430627	1173088	317705	9.0	Pixar's most " epic " animated film since " Toy Story . "	Although " The Incredibles " is not the best film Pixar has released ( via Disney ) since 1995's " Toy Story , " I felt it is the most epic . When I went to go see " Toy Story " in 1995 , the epic scale of the picture - - the non-stop frantic pace , the action sequences , etc . - - were all so breathtaking that it contained the same tour de force attitude as , believe it or not , a blockbuster such as " Terminator 2 " : a crowd-pleasing , overwhelming picture . " Monsters , Inc . " wasn't quite as epic . It was a great movie , just as good as " Toy Story , " but it didn't have the same style per se . " Finding Nemo " was very good as well but still didn't capture the same epic scale as " Toy Story . " ( I'm not saying that's a bad thing , just different . ) " The Incredibles " seemed to . I saw it on DVD and from beginning to end the action is non-stop , the laughs aplenty , and the exotic locations and action-hero references continuous . For this reason , somehow , it reminded me very much of " Toy Story . " It seemed like older Pixar , rather than some of their newer stuff ( all of which is great as well ) . Pixar has yet to make a bad movie . Even their worst - - " A Bug's Life " - - was better than most animated films . " The Incredibles " also returns to the spoof roots of " Monsters , Inc . " and " Toy Story " ( something " Finding Nemo " did but not as often ) - - it parodies cultural references . ( Something hard to do in an underwater sea adventure . ) Although this is a family film , it is NOT a " children's film . " That is evident from the beginning when the fake news reel in " The Incredibles " features articles about a suicidal man suing superheroes because he " didn't want to be saved . " This is clearly a tongue-in-cheek criticism of the shameless legal standards of the day . ( Such as the woman who sued McDonald's because her coffee was too hot . A true story ! ) Another film might not be clever enough to integrate iconic cultural references into itself but " The Incredibles " does . Similarly , using superheroes , Pixar examines the at-home relationship of a family and spoofs our own rituals . ( Such as eating at the dinner table - - the mom tries to stop the squabbling kids just like we do , only because she has superpowers , it's a bit . . . different . ) All in all " The Incredibles " really is a great animated film . I enjoyed it more than " Finding Nemo " ( which I didn't expect to as I loved " Nemo " ) and just as much as " Toy Story " and " Monsters , Inc . " Pixar has solidified a new style of family film-making - - the cultural parody animated film - - and the evidence of this can be seen in such take-offs of the formula as " Shrek " and " Shark Tale " ( which featured many cultural references as well ) . All in all " The Incredibles " is incredibly fun . And funny .
431023	1173088	88680	9.0	Great slice of underrated ( dark ) film-making from a cinematic genius	I don't know why everyone thinks " After Hours " ends happily . This is a brooding , dark , bitter film , with a pessimistic outlook on life and a downright depressing core message . It is a " comedy " with no laughs , and few chuckles . It is also a great cult film by director Martin Scorsese that came and went in 1985 with little attention . It's surprising to see that Scorsese took on another comedy so shortly after his major flop , The King of Comedy ( 1983 ) , starring Robert De Niro . Scorsese publicly acknowledged that he wished he had never made The King of Comedy and his star disowned it . It was a film so far ahead of its time , no one understood it ? or much less , cared to see it . Thank goodness this did not dissuade Scorsese from making another comedy . He was back two years later with After Hours , which is an intense , hellish , nightmarish odyssey through New York City's Soho late at night , and into the morning . The film's protagonist , Paul ( Griffin Dunne ) , is an unlikable character who generally gains sympathy with us only because of his grueling misfortunes . Fate , it seems , has a grudge against poor Paul ; as the night progresses , it only becomes worse and worse , until he is running away from a bloodthirsty mob and happens to inadvertently witness a random murder . " I'll probably get blamed for that , " he says to himself , which is exactly what we're thinking . This really is the sort of film that makes you almost want to stop watching , it is so painful . Nothing at all goes right for Paul . When he seeks comfort in a friend , he is relieved , finally able to sit back and take a breath of air - - only to look outside and see his " friend " alerting the bloodthirsty mob . The plot ? what little there is ? begins in a typical daytime office setting . Paul meets a girl after a hard day at work ( Rosanna Arquette ) and they arrange to meet later that evening . On the way there he loses all his cash through the open window of a speeding taxicab and is left with few dollars . On top of this , Paul soon realizes that Arquette is not his type and leaves to go home ? only to find that local subway fare has been raised and he doesn't have enough cash to make it back to his apartment . Thus begins his nightmare . Scorsese's genius move here is that as Paul progresses onwards into the night , the film slowly loses its balance and topples over into a distinct category of weirdness . The beginning is fairly standard and realistic . It is typical Scorsese with exterior shots of New York City , character-driven dialogue and so on and so forth . About of the way through it becomes a bizarre Terry Gilliam-esquire hell ride and Scorsese lets loose on everything . It's brilliant film-making and a devastating satire of New York's late-night underbelly . The original ending ( storyboarded but never filmed ) involved Paul being reborn after crawling through a random woman's legs ? that's how bizarre , and creative , this film actually is . Dunne is suitable in the role of Paul ? a fairly unknown character actor ; he doesn't have the charisma or talent to be a typical leading man . Which , I think , is part of the reason he seems so comfortable in the role of Paul , who is certainly one of cinema's most unusual heroes . Another film might setup Paul as a meek , hard-working , likable guy who gets stuck in bad situations ? when in fact Paul is a confident jerk who probably deserves what is coming to him . Before picking up Arquette he flirts with her roommate ( Linda Fiorentino ) and gives her a back massage . He puts the moves on Arquette , then ditches her when she resists . He's not shy and he's not an all-around good guy ? he's a flawed character that only helps the entire experience feel more realistic . Scorsese is at the top of his game here . Many techniques would be used five years later in GoodFellas . Note the ringing phone and the abrupt lunge forward ; the keys being tossed out of the window in first-person perspective ; the rotating camera as it pans around Paul's head in a diner ; and so on and so forth . Although it is not his best work nor his most distinct , After Hours is ample proof that Scorsese has a firm handle on black comedy and is able to stretch beyond his ( arguably ) typified style of gangsters and low-lifes planning how to " whack " people . Scorsese bashers should see this , and his fans should too ? insightful for everyone .
430683	1173088	92618	9.0	One of Mickey Rourke's best performances in a darkly funny film	" Barfly " was a fairly successful film when it was released and garnered generally favorable reviews . Roger Ebert gave it four out of four , and along with " Angel Heart , " it helped solidify 1987 as the Year of Mickey Rourke . However , almost twenty years later it isn't talked so much about anymore , and I feel it deserves to be . Rourke gives one of his finest performances as Henry , a loner who walks hunched over like the Hunchback of Notre Dame . Henry works at a bar as a runner - delivering orders and such . But he's always getting into drunken brawls with the bartender , usually losing . One day Henry's life takes a turn when he meets a downtrodden woman ( Faye Dunaway ) and they embark on a relationship . " Barfly " is a great film . Rourke was vocal later on in his career about his dislike of director Barbet Schroeder , but Schroeder's direction is part of what makes this film so good . However , the absolute best aspect of the movie is Rourke's performance . Embodying the late writer Charles Bukowski ( whose work this was based upon , and who had a brief cameo in the film ) , Rourke is unrecognizable - like Billy Bob Thornton in " Sling Blade , " his entire demeanor and physicality seems to change . I highly recommend " Barfly " - it's funny , dark , witty , touching and downright enjoyable . One of the best films of the ' 80s .
430826	1173088	163988	9.0	An excellent , misunderstood film by Martin Scorsese	In the opening sequence of Martin Scorsese's " Taxi Driver " ( 1976 ) we see the watery eyes of Robert De Niro , examining his surroundings , breathing in the atmosphere visually . His deadly stare sends a shiver down our spines , giving us the impression of a man haunted by unseen demons . In " Bringing Out the Dead " the watery pair of eyes belong to Nicolas Cage , who has always given the appearance of an unhealthy , perhaps diseased human being , not so much harmed by natural causes as much as by his environment . " Bringing Out the Dead " is a movie that takes place primarily during the night , where the seedy low-lifes come out to play . Hookers , pimps , junkies , gangs - they're everywhere that Frank ( Cage ) looks . He can't escape them . But when we look closer , we realize he is not haunted by the people themselves as much as the faces he is seeing - the face of an 18-year-old girl that he was unable to save months earlier . Frank is a paramedic in New York City . He rides around at night with his partner ( John Goodman ) whose confusingly pessimistic optimism could be compared to that of Wizard in " Taxi Driver , " although like many fans of the film , I do not think that comparing the two movies too often is such a good idea . They are two separate pieces of work , both with different points . Because the film was directed by Scorsese , and written by Paul Schrader ( " Taxi Driver " ) , comparisons are almost inevitable . But are they just ? In short , no , they are not . Scorsese's similarities to " Taxi Driver " are sometimes deliberate , such as his decision to use quick cuts of the ambulance tail lights and sirens , and of course the examining eyes of Cage . Both of these shots were used in " Taxi Driver , " only the ambulance was of course a taxi . Both films take place in New York City , primarily at night , where a beaten-down , depressed , shy , socially-awkward man stares out of the window of his vehicle , trying to make sense of the madness on the streets . One night , Frank saves a man from a heart attack . He is put in the custody of a nearby hospital , and the man's worried daughter ( Patricia Arquette ) consoles in Frank . Why ? " My mother always told me I had the face of a priest , " he explains , in an effort to justify her own ramblings . In that sort of way , Frank is very similar to Travis Bickle . But those who say that " Bringing Out the Dead " is merely a remake of " Taxi Driver " are short-sighted , narrow-minded individuals . It is a movie with very deep themes , and a poignant message . It makes you think , versus most summer blockbusters . It was advertised on the trailers as a ghost movie in the vein of " The Sixth Sense . " It isn't . Instead , it's a truly touching character piece that is always on the verge of becoming a modern-day masterpiece . ( And incidentally , in case the critics who hated " Bringing Out the Dead " have forgotten , " Taxi Driver " was originally considered to be a boring , pointless movie , with an " unlikable leading man " and " disgusting morals . " Sometimes the years can help a movie become far more appreciated , and I feel fairly confident that this will be the case with " Dead . " ) Some critics were unimpressed with the film's wandering , but that is the entire point . To the paramedics portrayed in " Bringing Out the Dead , " night and day intertwine ; days fly by with no real purpose ; there is no apparent point to their lives , other than to save people . And for Frank , the ghosts come back to haunt him , which is something he probably never expected after initially deciding to become a paramedic .
430479	1173088	330829	9.0	You'll laugh until you cry	Robin Williams used to be a very unique talent ( as far as comedy goes ) - and his standup was great . But it seems the awkward shift from comedy films to dramas like " Dead Poet's Society , " " Awakenings " and " Good Will Hunting " - no matter how good they may have been - severely altered the public perception and he became something else . Twenty years after his last performance on Broadway , Robin returns once again for his best standup routine - ever . As disappointing as his recent cinematic comedic endeavours may be , this proves he's still got it - at least as far as standup goes . He spits out the jokes faster than you could imagine . He careens from one to the next and before you have the time to stop and laugh at one , he's launching into another . Each time you think you've found a new favorite joke in the program , he tops it . One reviewer on an external site said it's some type of " fake controversy " - an old , expired comic pretending to be daring when he's really just under the cover of HBO . Whatever - all I know is that this is hilarious , and really raunchy . The last joke - an extended bit revolving around the topic of a sexual act - is absolutely hysterical and the entire audience can hardly control themselves . If you like Robin Williams , you'll love this . If you don't like Robin Williams - the actor we've come to known through cinema - you'll definitely love this , because it shows a very different side to a man many people consider to be spoiled milk in the comedy-film biz .
430455	1173088	407887	9.0	One of the year's best films , and Scorsese's best work in over a decade .	Not just one of the year's best films , but also Martin Scorsese's best work in over a decade , The Departed is a vintage slice of the director's style infused with a modern edge . A loose remake of the Hong Kong three-part thriller Internal Affairs , The Departed is hardly an inferior Hollywood copy ; Scorsese takes the material and makes it entirely his own . Opening with a classy flashback and then leaping forward with a ferocious act of violence on-screen , this is as well paced and energetic as anything Scorsese has done in well over a decade ; not since Casino has he made something so fresh and riveting . The movie , which takes place in Boston , features an interweaving story headlined by a stellar cast . Billy Costigan ( Leonardo DiCaprio ) is a troubled cop who goes deep undercover to bring down notorious mobster Frank Costello ( Jack Nicholson ) , who has control of the police force through several moles ; one of whom ( played by Matt Damon ) begins to suspect someone in Frank's operation is a rat . As he races to expose Billy , he loses the affection of his girlfriend , who begins to ? oddly enough ? embark on an affair with Billy ( she's a police psychiatrist ) . Supporting castmembers include Martin Sheen , Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg in his best performance since Boogie Nights . The plot twists and turns so many times yet never becomes pretentious or overly deliberate ; it all seems to connect very naturally , and perhaps the only portion of the film that I didn't quite buy was the romantic subplot , which would have worked if it had focused solely on Damon's tensions with his girlfriend , but became fairly unbelievable once she begins cheating on him with DiCaprio's character . The performances are extraordinary ? Jack Nicholson has a lot of fun with his role and comes across as a psychopathic comedian trapped in a mob boss ' body . DiCaprio is riveting and delivers the most convincing performance of them all ? evoking a young De Niro towards the end of the picture in both mannerisms and physicality . Directorially this is Scorsese's strongest effort in years , and it shows in every frame of the picture . It may not be groundbreaking and it may not be as socially relevant as some of the director's best works , but as pure entertainment this ranks as some of his finest to date .
429452	1173088	112864	10.0	Is " Yippee Ki Yay Mother " an Understatement ?	" Die Hard : With a Vengeance " is a full-blooded action vehicle ; it is a smart one , too , because its filmmakers realize the ol ' one - man - army - trapped - in - an - area routine can't last long . So they have changed the technique to a game of revenge ; cat-and-mouse . Some could call it smarter than its predecessors ; and on a level as a thriller I must admit it is more intense . It is a lot better than the 1990 Renny Harlin actioner " Die Hard 2 : Die Harder . " But on terms of fun , you can't beat the original . John McTiernan , who brought us " Predator , " " The 13th Warrior " and " Die Hard , " returned to end this series on a high note . Of course , like all sagas , " Die Hard " is far from over , with another sequel due to be released summer 2004 . But until then , we can look to " Die Hard : With a Vengeance " as the end-all to the overall excellent John McClane trilogy . The third film opens up where nothing left off ; McClane ( Bruce Willis ) is on the streets of NYC when a man who calls himself " Simon " blows up a Manhattan department store , and then orders McClane to stand in Harlem with a sandwich board that says . . . well . . . something you wouldn't want to be wearing in Harlem . After a convenience store owner named Zeus ( Samuel L . Jackson ) saves McClane , Simon orders both men to run around New York City and do Simon Says-type-games . It's all good fun , and a step away from the original film . Which can be good or bad . Soon McClane finds out that " Simon " is really the brother of Hans Gruber ( Alan Rickman ) from the first film , and that " Simon " is out for revenge against McClane ( or is he ? ) , and he will stop at nothing to kill McClane . But , of course , being a madman , he plays mind games with John McClane first . And the simon says mind games are tense , taught and action-packed . It's hard to compare something like this to the original for one major reason : It is nothing like the original . The original was about a lone man fighting off a million guys , Rambo-style . But what saved it from becoming another average action spectacular was the great dialogue , non-stop SMART action sequences , and engaging performences by all aboard the project . Fast-forward two years later and you've got a replicant copy of the first film set in Dulles airport in Washington , D . C . But in all respect , " Die Hard : With a Vengeance " is not recycled . Its technique is new , and it almost seems as if it is not a sequel to the other " Die Hard " films . Which is probably not too odd , seeing that the script , originally titled " Simon Says " ( no , not the Dennis Rodman one ) , was actually a sequel to " Lethal Weapon . " Of course , moderations were made after the " Die Hard " series bought out the script , but the character of Zeus was probably Danny Glover , and John McClane was probably Mel Gibson . Thinkabouddit . Bruce Willis is still John McClane . This film takes his character into a bit of a darker realm ; McClane now has an alcohol problem , and his wife has left him again . Man , you'd think after having your life saved TWICE by the same guy that MAYBE you should stick with him . In fact , we don't even see McClane's wife ( Bonnie Bedalia ) in this film at all . Notta . Zip . Although we are led to believe they will hook up again at the end . Just wait until the next film , I saw . Samuel L . Jackson adds some flair to the film , taking the movie into a more cop-buddy dimension ( " Lethal Weapon " ) . Jackson's character is a racist , and it's a bit odd to see a black racist in a film . It's usually those nasty white fellas . : ) I liked Jackson's character , because it provides for dialogue outlet on McClane's behalf , and sets the film up for some very funny sequences . The character interaction is a lot stronger here than it was in " Die Hard 2 : Die Harder . " " Die Hard : With a Vengeance " is hard to compare to the original because it is so very different . But the bottom line is that this sequel is much better than " Die Hard 2 : Die Harder , " but a step down from " Die Hard . " But seeing how different it is , you might think it is better than both the films . It really depends on your preferences . I give this solid action film a solid rating of stars - an all-around solid action sequel . Solid fun .
430297	1173088	105151	10.0	Adaptation .	Some Spoilers . " The Player " opens with a long , tracking shot outside of a Hollywood studio . We see a man walk by ( Fred Ward ) who complains about how directors use too many cuts in films nowadays , and that they should use long , tracking shots , instead . The irony ? The beginning of our movie is using a long , tracking shot . We wind around buildings filled with hoards of famous stars and directors and writers . Griffin Mills ( Tim Robbins ) is a studio executive - he hears film " pitches , " or outlines for film stories . We see Buck Henry ( writer of " The Graduate " ) throwing a pitch to him for " The Graduate : Part II . " It is 1992 , and every time a pitch is thrown , we hear a film exec respond to the pitch thrower by saying , " It should star Julia Roberts and Bruce Willis . " One British man throwing a pitch to Griffin insists that his film shall have no big stars , especially not Julia Roberts or Bruce Willis . He says that he wants no action , no car chases , no sex , no happy ending . And when the hilarious , surprise movie-within-a-movie ending of " The Player " starts to unfold . . . well , let's just say that things do not always turn out the way people want them to . And this is what makes " The Player " tick . It's a scathing satire , one that the sharpest of film buffs will love for its in-jokes and cameos ( over 60 ! ) , and the most naive of filmgoers will love for its ironic , good-guys-lose , bad-guys-win story . Griffin Mills ( Robbins ) has a nice life - a nice car , a nice girl , a nice job , and he's filthy rich . But lately his standing as a film executive has been threatened by the new guy ( Peter Gallagher ) , who is showing lots of potential in the field . One day he gets a postcard with threats on the back . Thinking that the postcard came from a writer he pushed away months ago ( Vincent D'Onofrio ) , he confronts him . One thing leads to another and he ends up killing the writer - unintentionally , we are led to assume , though there are some doubts . But being the ironic movie this is , Griffin has , of course , killed the wrong writer . And so he continues getting postcards and threats - someone even puts a poisonous snake in his car . Griffin becomes more and more paranoid as the days go on , and almost falls to the pressure of police questioning , led by Whoopi Goldberg . In-jokes flow freely . Some big movie buffs might pick up on such references as to Levinson , or " The Bicycle Thief " ( 1942 ) , or movie posters hanging on the walls in the background ( " M , " " Casablanca , " etc . ) . But it will take numerous viewings before you realize that they are more than just there to please film buffs - they are there for irony . Film buffs might be the only ones who pick up on the irony of them , too . This is a movie made for movie lovers , for the movie insiders and for those who like a good laugh . It's a spoof on tinseltown and all its crazy little rituals of getting a film made . This could be called an anti-heroic movie - and I'm sure it has been called that . It's not for those who like poetic justice in their films . Good guys burn and bad guys win . At first I didn't like this , but then I realized that it isn't trying to be anti-heroic - it's being ironic . And let's face it : Irony is funny . " The Player " reminds me very much of " Adaptation " ( 2002 ) , the story of a writer played by Nicolas Cage who doesn't want to Hollywoodize his script about orchids . " I just don't want to turn it into a Hollywood thing , " he says . He says something to the effect of , " No violence , no drugs , no sex , no people overcoming obstacles to succeed in the end . " The irony is that , in the end , everything he didn't want to happen in his script happens . There's some of that irony in " The Player , " plus a little bit more . If you liked " Adaptation , " then you've got to see " The Player . " .
430143	1173088	290334	10.0	The budget is bigger , the cast is larger , the story is deeper , the film is better . . .	The film begins . We are shown a tour guide leading students and adults through the White House in Washington , DC . It seems normal enough . A security guard notices someone straying off the path and asks if he is lost . The man raises his head , and a tail flicks out from behind him . Before the security guard can do anything he is down on the ground , alerting all security in the area of a mutant attack . The blue creature , known later as Nightcrawler , teleports past dozens of guards and kicks and whips them with his tail and fists . Finally the action dies down with the creature being shot ( not killed ) , and we are left to catch our breaths . Reader , I'll tell you , it took me a few moments to catch mine . It sure looks as if " X2 " is on the right track for a sequel , and if anything , it seems better . The budget is obviously bigger as we see the truly amazing special effects in the beginning of the film , and though the action never quite again reaches its high-point as in the beginning , it sets the film up for other non-stop action sequences , just like the James Bond movies are known for doing . But that's not all " X-Men 2 , " or " X2 " as the posters abbreviate , is all about . It has an important human element that adds to the pure , non-stop , full-blooded action-spectaculars throughout the film . The cast is bigger , the budget is bigger , the story is bigger , and the action is plentiful . Teenagers will enjoy the action side , and adults will probably enjoy the human side to the story . It seamlessly combines both these two elements / techniques even more than the original film did . I didn't expect to enjoy this film more than the first , but I must say I did . It reunites the old cast for a continuation of the struggle for mutants and humans to live together in the same world . The film begins with an assassination attempt on the president's life , carried out by a teleporting mutant . This act upsets the entire world , and the president is about to begin the mutant-human war predicted by Charles Xavier ( Patrick Stewart ) in the first film . In an effort to get to the bottom of the attack on the president's life , and prevent world-wide war , Xavier sends out Storm ( Halle Berry ) and Dr . Jean Grey ( Famke Janssen ) to search for the teleporting mutant and discover the truth behind the assassination attempt . Meanwhile , Logan " Wolverine " ( Hugh Jackman ) has returned to Xavier's mansion after searching for any signs of his past . He has found none . He is greeted by Rogue ( Anna Paquin ) and her new boyfriend Bobby " Iceman , " who was briefly seen in the first film and is given a deeper character backdrop in this film . But soon things start to turn for the worst as an attack on Xavier's mansion is led by Stryker ( Brian Cox ) , the man behind the assassination attempt , who wants all mutants to be killed off . He kidnaps Charles Xavier , and reveals that he wishes for Charles to kill all mutants . How ? By focusing Xavier's psychic powers / telepathy on a particular group of people , Xavier can actually kill them . So Stryker plans to use his disowned mutant son ( who also has psychic powers ) to control Xavier's mind ( sort of ) and focus on all the mutants in the world , automatically killing them . With this plot in motion , Mystique ( Rebecca Romijn-Stamos ) has little time to free Eric " Magneto , " which results in a truly amazing escape sequence which I will not spoil for you . Now , in an ironic moment , old enemies must fight together to bring down Stryker before his plan follows through . But the band of X-Men are far from solving their problems , as a new mutant , Lady Deathstrike ( Kelly Hu ) may stand in their way of defeating Stryker . And Wolverine may also find the key to his past in this mess . " X-Men 2 , " unlike other sequels , improves upon itself . Tragic sequels go to the dogs when the filmmakers are either too proud to try and surpass the original , or are too arrogant to even attempt it . " X-Men " was an excellent comic-book adaptation , in more ways than one , and " X-Men 2 " is only better . It contains more action than " Spider-Man " and its human factor is even more active than it was in the original , which is ironic , since the original was praised for having both action and human attributes . The cast is first-class , but the real scene-stealer , just like in the original , is Hugh Jackman as Wolverine . The Aussie actor disguises his accent with a rough American one , just like British chap Bob Hoskins did in " Who Framed Roger Rabbit ? " . If the filmmakers want a new James Bond after Pierce Brosnan , they need look no farther , because though he may not look the part in this film , Jackman can look very suave and proper ( see " Kate and Leopold " ) , and is my top choice for the next Bond . Comic book films are usually hit-or-miss . They're never in between . " X-Men " was an unexpected hit , but more than that , a good unexpected hit . It wasn't all hype . It was smart , action-packed and hat a great character side to it . Like I said before , " X-Men 2 " improves upon all this and is the rare sequel that is better than its predecessor . I expect " X-Men 2 " to break some box office records , and unlike other films , I can honestly say that it deserves it . stars - John Ulmer
429603	1173088	73766	10.0	Exceedingly hilarious , very warm , and one of my favorite comedies . . .	A hilarious Neil Simon comedy that evokes laughs from beginning to end . The late Walter Matthau is the grouchy ex-comedian who is persuaded to join together with his ex-partner ( the late Oscar-winner George Burns ) for a final reunion show on stage . Benjamin Martin is Matthau's agent and nephew , and the two have just as much chemistry as Matthau and Burns . I love Matthau's grumpy character - - he's just the same as he always is , and yet also very different . Burns , as the absent-minded old man , is just as funny as Matthau . Matthau : Want some crackers ? I've got coconut , pineapple and graham . Burns : How about a plain cracker ? Matthau : I don't got plain . I got coconut , pineapple and graham . Burns : OkayMatthau : They're in the cupboard in the kitchen . Burns : Maybe later . Or how about this : Matthau : When I did black , the whites knew what I was saying ! You've got to see it in the movie to understand it ! All in all , a refreshingly hilarious , sweet , heartfelt , warm , belivable character comedy with a heart and some of the most memorable quotes of all time . They just don't make them like this anymore ! In a time when all the newest comedies are crude , juvenile and stupid , this leans back towards the tender core of what comedy really is - - funny characters , smart and funny dialogue , and grand entertainment . One of the best buddy comedies of all time , right up there with " Planes , Trains and Automobiles , " " Lethal Weapon , " and " The Hard Way . " You may have a hard time finding this for rent or on TV , but trust me , it will be worth your time ! stars . - John Ulmer
430268	1173088	118715	10.0	It has its flaws but it is also extremely entertaining and one of the Coen Brothers ' best films .	If you were a fan of " Fargo , " you might just like " The Big Lebowski , " a bizarre comedy whose hero ( if that is the appropriate word ) is played by Jeff Bridges as a spaced-out junkie who lives in Los Angeles , unemployed , with a trashy apartment and few belongings . His name is Lebowski , but he is known by his friends as The Dude , and he prefers that moniker rather than his birth name . Every evening Dude goes bowling with his best buddies , Walter ( John Goodman ) and Donny ( Steve Buscemi ) . Walter is a Vietnam veteran , and in his perception , all incidents relate to the war . " What does the Vietnam War have to do with anything ? " Dude asks him at a fragile moment in both their lives . Instead of disputing , Walter gives him a big bear hug . The story begins with a humorous and self-aware voice-over by the narrator , played by Sam Elliot in a few recurring cameos . He informs us that Dude's adventure started on an eventful night not very long ago , when a duo of criminals broke into his house in search of The Big Lebowski , a local millionaire who happens to share Dude's last name . After dunking Dude's face into a toilet bowl and realizing that they've attacked the incorrect individual , the pair of idiots urinate on Dude's rug and flee the apartment . Dude figures that the only man truly responsible for the incident is Lebowski himself , so he makes a trip out to his mansion and is informed by Lebowski's assistant ( portrayed by Philip Seymour Hoffman with the perfect amount of nervousness ) that Lebowski's wife has been kidnapped and is being held for ransom . Suspecting that she is in the custody of the two men who attacked Dude , Lebowski offers the slacker a chance to be the courier of his ransom fee . " Her life is in your hands , " Lebowski tells him . He promises him some cash to transport a briefcase containing the money , and Lebowski agrees to help him out . Unfortunately , the kidnappers never receive their ransom , and Dude's car is stolen , along with Lebowski's money . It just so happens that Lebowski's unfaithful wife owed some money to a trio of German nihilists , as well as an adult filmmaker and an assortment of other odd creatures , and now Lebowski is being targeted for the cash . Everyone seems to think that the briefcase is in his possession , and he is threatened that he will lose his " Johnson " unless it is returned . Fearing for his life ( and more importantly , his Johnson ) Dude takes comfort in Walter , who tracks down the 15-year-old teenager who stole the car and the briefcase and has apparently bought a sports car with a small portion of the briefcase's contents . " See this Tommy ? This is what happens when you mess with a stranger ! " Walter yells at the boy as he single-handedly demolishes the sports car . We all anticipate the obvious punch line far ahead of time , but the result is nevertheless extremely funny . The Coen Brothers , Ethan and Joel , are extremely gifted filmmakers . They burst onto screens across the nation in 1984 with their indie classic " Blood Simple , " which starred Frances McDormand and Dan Hedaya , the former of whom would later star in " Fargo " as the bumbling police officer Marge Gunderson . As usual , the Coens fall back on their quirky characters for comic relief and enjoyable antics , particularly Buscemi , who is one of the best character actors in Hollywood , and who also manages to be funny in whichever role he chooses - despite having to say anything funny at all . In " Fargo " he was the blundering kidnapper , Carl , and in " The Big Lebowski , " he lets his hair part across his head and hang low across his face , completely changing his entire pattern of speech . He's the goofy little squirt who tags along with Dude and Walter , and manages to repeat everything they say and ask questions about discussions long after they have ended . " You're like a child who has wandered into the middle of a movie and wants to know what's going on ! " Walter tells him . " What's your point , Walter ? " he asks . But it's the innocent nature of his tone that leads us to like him , and it's Walter's crazy antics that makes us feel attached to him , and it's The Dude's trademark humor that makes us enjoy watching him . The Coens have succeeded at making a great comedy with characters that actually have their own characteristics . But it is the Coens ' eloquent use of proverbial language that is really what elevates the film above all else . The script is wonderful and witty . This has some of the best dialogue I have ever heard , ranking up there with " Pulp Fiction " and the work of Elmore Leonard . Walter's rants consume much of the dialogue , which I think is fine . " The Big Lebowski " is a movie with considerably large structural flaws and weaknesses . Yet the film seems to know this , letting the audience in on the secret during the introductory voice-over narration . " Aw , I've lost my train of thought , " we're told , as The Stranger mumbles on about the movie's plot . And towards the end , we're all told by The Stranger that he sincerely hopes we enjoyed the story , even if it's nothing special . Yup , that about sums it all up . " The Big Lebowski " is a movie with a lot of joy , wit , and wicked humor : three reasons you've got to see one of the most enjoyable films of the past decade .

Of Mice and MenAmazingly superb film based on the novel of the same name involves two Depression-era workers ( Gary Sinise and John Malkovich ) running away from the law and landing a decent-enough job at a ranch where they harvest crops and hay . Malkovich is amazing as the big , dumb , strong man who was " kicked in the head by a mule as a kid , " and Sinise - - who also directed - - proves here that he isn't only a terrific leading man , but also a wonderful director in the vein of classic films you just don't see anymore .

430299	1173088	93409	10.0	A bruising , hard action movie with enough humor and chemistry between the two lead actors it will satisfy even the least of cop-buddy fans . One of the greatest films of all time .	Some Spoiler Herein . " I guess we're gonna have to register you as a lethal weapon . " - Danny Glover , " Lethal Weapon . " There's such a flow and deep character progression that helps make " Lethal Weapon " what it is today - - a funny , action-packed , and yet also quite intelligent cop-buddy film that owes its success in part to the smartness of its script , the solid direction by Richard Donner , and the interaction of its two lead stars , Mel Gibson and Danny Glover , who bounce jokes and one-liners off each other with such comic timing and gruffness it makes one wonder why the strict comedies released nowadays can't be half as funny as this mixed-genre buddy film . " Lethal Weapon " is a very tough film , brutal and vicious . Roger Ebert described it perfectly when he said , " A movie where you and your date grab each other's arm every four minutes and you walk out black and blue and grinning from ear to ear . " That's exactly how I feel when I'm done watching it . The later sequels were extremely good given that the formula of these type of films usually get old very quick - in fact , as sequels go they surprisingly never really grew old in formula at all . But they did seem to gradually lose the toughness and brutality of the first film , at least after the second , something that helps elevate it to a type of hard action movie status . Those looking for a soft buddy comedy have rented the wrong movie . The strength of the film lies within the hands of its two lead stars ; it is firmly rooted and all else flows with ease and an almost simple splendor . Mel Gibson plays a Mad Max gone homicidal . Danny Glover plays a retiring cop stuck with a lethal weapon of a partner for his last few days as an officer of the law . They'll be lucky to make it through the next week without killing each other first . It opens high up in the night sky to the song " Jingle Bell Rock " and comes to focus in a naked woman's apartment . She's drugged up and walks to an open ledge overlooking the landscape above and below . She jumps . The next day . Sgt . Roger Murtaugh ( Glover ) is having his fiftieth birthday . He's retiring from the police force . As he so aptly puts it , " I'm too old for this [ feces ] . " Murtagh's bad day gets even worse when he's assigned a new partner named Martin Riggs ( Gibson ) . Riggs is suicidal , the police force has their suspicions of this , and so they team him up with Murtaugh as a way of ( a ) seeing if he's just playing crazy to get a pension and ( b ) to get him out of their way . Murtaugh thinks he's playing crazy to make some extra cash - until he watches Riggs put a gun in his mouth and almost pull the trigger . " You really are crazy . " Then the two men stumble upon a drug smuggling operation that goes back to the days of the Vietnam War . Things get personal when Murtaugh's family is in danger . Murtaugh's daughter is kidnapped and the two men have to find a way to get her back alive . Most films like these are just shouting matches between the two cops . They typically have a paper-thin plot with lots of shoot-'em-up action . " Lethal Weapon " is smarter than this - - it has shouting , it has plenty of shoot-'em-ups , but it also has a good plot - - enough plot for at least ten of these buddy films , The actors are terrific in their roles . Danny Glover's family man is absolutely convincing . I especially like throughout the four films when someone will make a remark about how old he is - - like his daughter mentioning his beard making him look older in the first film - - and he just stares in a mirror and looks at himself with that , " I'm getting older . I can't believe it " look . Mel Gibson is perfect as Riggs , a suicidal maniac who doesn't care if he goes down until he finds something to live for . The audience finds out early on that his wife has been killed , and her death has pushed him over the edge to the point where he has to think of a good reason not to blow his head off each day . There's a very tense scene when he's putting a gun to his head , then in his mouth , and he starts crying and trying to think of a reason to live . Later he tells us what the reason is : " The job , " he says . Most cops in films have families like Danny Glover's character . Riggs truly has nothing but his job , and if he dies carrying it out he couldn't care less . It's startling how effective a film this is . It's bruising , dynamite , action-packed storytelling , but it never forgets its plot , its characters and their progression , nor the dramatic side of the movie . Anyone not touched by Riggs ' pre-suicide scene probably should seek help . Here is one of the best films of all time . - John Ulmer
430215	1173088	38991	10.0	Brilliant , unsettling and underrated	Everyone knows " Citizen Kane , " not so many remember " The Stranger " from 1946 , a quiet , low-key thriller that is unrelentlessly paced and flawlessly acted . It stars Orson Welles as a Nazi war criminal who has escaped to middle-America and claimed a new life for himself ; when a stranger comes looking for him , his entire life is tossed upside down and he even becomes suspicious of his wife's intentions . ( Resulting in a darkly gripping scene . ) This movie is one of Welles ' finest and probably one of the greatest of all time . His direction is top-notch and although it may not be quite as showy or glossed-over as " Citizen Kane , " and the film's scale is not as epic , it doesn't need to be . This works very successfully as a simple low-key thriller and the fact that it doesn't try to achieve anything more is one of its better traits . If this were made nowadays no doubt it would be overblown , lacking intelligence and totally predictable - - this is none of the above . It's a must-see film and , as a thriller , certainly should be classified as one of the all-time best .
430193	1173088	108757	10.0	Was once quite brilliant - but after the original cast all left it went downhill	During its heyday , " E . R . " was one of the most brilliant television shows ever made - I never really got into it while it was on TV , but re-watching older episodes on DVD with no commercials or weekly waits for new shows makes it far easier to enjoy and become addicted to . Seasons 3 , 4 and 5 were really when the show hit its peak and got into a good stride - there was equal character development and , apart from some side-steps , pretty consistent and engaging story lines for the main actors , of whom were included George Clooney , Anthony Edwards , Erik LsSalle , Julianna Marguiles , and Noah Wyle . The show never seemed to resort to the schmaltzy factor of others in its genre , and the medical side of the show was highly accurate and incredibly realistic - you really do believe you're in an Emergency Room . If you compare the realism of this show to soap opera disguised as medical drama such as " Grey's Anatomy , " the difference is palpable - it's clear that the advisers on the show definitely steered the crew in the right direction . The conception of the show was actually the product of Michael Crichton , the author of " Jurassic Park " and " Sphere , " who was once a Harvard Medical Student and thought a realistic and gripping show about the profession would be a hit . He was right . Unfortunately , somewhere around the sixth season or so a lot of regulars like Clooney and Marguiles left and were replaced unceremoniously by notably less endearing characters . I suppose on a show that encompasses so many characters , the producers of " E . R . " believe any character can be replaced by another - but when you're watching a show for six years and are used to the same characters and have built kind of an emotional connection with them , to see them " replaced " as if nothing has happened is hard to get used to . It's no surprise that the ratings soon dropped in proportion to the amount of original actors leaving the show - Clooney departed for Hollywood and they hired a lookalike later on to replace him which I found highly amusing . Overall , the show is one of the best to ever air on television , but the past five or six years in particular have really damaged its reputation and sunk it lower and lower . And recently it has turned into exactly what it once wasn't : a standard weekly soap opera disguised as a drama . I mean , when you start killing off your characters in fantastic sequences such as helicopters falling out of the air onto people , you know you've hit rock bottom . And killing off Dr . Greene's character by giving him a brain tumor was definitely the nail in the coffin for the further seasons . I do recommend watching the show up through about the sixth or seventh season , because those seasons are truly brilliant evidence of television's positive traits ; but after that it's largely forgettable .
429493	1173088	786802	10.0	Haven't laughed this hard in ages !	I don't think I've laughed as hard as I did watching " The Gang Gets Crippled " as I have since the early days of " Simpsons " and " SNL . " There are so many priceless jokes in this episode that it took me about two or three times re-watching the episode to catch a lot of the gags . The episode begins with Charlie getting run over by a car and being put in a wheelchair . The gang heads to a local strip club where they find out it's easy to score girls while disabled due to sympathy . Charlie gets two free lapdances . Earlier that day , Dennis ' and Dee's father ( Danny DeVito ) arrives announcing he has divorced their mother and is giving away all his money to the poor and wants to be a part of " the gang . " He ends up taking advantage of Charlie's disabilities at the strip club to pick up strippers ( " I want to live in filth again " ) and the two decide to become roommates . The next day Charlie gets a brilliant idea to dress up as a Vietnam war hero in the strip club . ( And seriously , the result of this is by far the funniest single line I've heard in a TV show in years - " What happened to you , honey ? " - " Viet-Gd @ mn ' Nam is what happened ; now go get me a beer , bch ! " And as DeVito wheels him away : " What , I was working her ! " ) Don't get me wrong , you have to have a sick sense of humor to enjoy this . Dennis and Rob go to the mall in wheelchairs to pick up girls , and both pretend to have Polio . ( " That's why I'm rockin ' the FDR look . " ) They end up having wheelchair races and beating each other up . The end of the episode is a killer . I won't ruin the joke , but just make sure you don't leave in the last minute or so . Overall this was a delightful blast of fresh air - after seeing so many stale sitcoms , this proved to me that FX really is becoming the new lead in character-driven comedy-dramas ( such as the equally superb " Rescue Me " which isn't quite as funny , however ) . My only hope is that " Sunny " doesn't become so popular that it attracts controversy and sells out and dumbs down its humor . Right now it's on par with the early episodes of " South Park " and " SNL " in terms of how irreverent its humor is - and personally , in my opinion , its plots are better than most comedy films I've seen within the last few years . Definitely must-see TV .
429539	1173088	107362	10.0	Totally misunderstood and underrated	" Last Action Hero " was one of the most commercially-publicized films of 1993 . Millions upon millions were pushed into the extravagant advertising campaign , which included a blimp with Arnold's face being flown over the premiere . ( According to the biography " Fantastic : The Life of Arnold Schwarzenegger " by Laurence Leamer . ) However , it was being released in the throes of Arnie controversy - Sly Stallone , Arnie's enemy , had devoted millions of his own cash to exploiting Arnold as a Nazi in the hopes of ruining his prospering film career . Sly paid off a tabloid reporter ( in secret - the truth only emerged years later ) to dig up evidence on Arnie's father - and some contribute this smear campaign to the failure of " Last Action Hero . " For some reason , it is regarded as one of cinema's biggest failures , when in fact it grossed $50 million past its budget of $85 mil in theaters alone , bringing its worldwide gross to $137 , 298 , 489 . Not exactly a flop , considering it also brought in quite a bit of cash once it reached the home video market . In Hollywood , someone hears something and it becomes truth . It has become a fact that " Last Action Hero " was one of the biggest flops of all-time , even though it wasn't . And , much like its box office intake , the critical reception of the film was vastly misunderstood . " Last Action Hero " is brilliant satire - spoofing all the clichés and inner-workings of all action films , but most specifically Arnold Schwarzenegger's - beginning with Jack Slater ( Arnold ) going to his cousin's house : a bomb goes off , kills two nearby cops ( one an aging black man days from retirement ) , but Arnie is left unscathed . Then he devotes his life to tracking down the killer . This film is being watched by a young child in a movie theater . His idol is Jack Slater , and soon he gets a magic movie ticket from an old theater owner and finds himself magically transported into the cinematic world . He becomes Slater's willing sidekick - the catch , however , is that Slater is unaware that he is a fictional character , and doesn't believe the child's " lies " about his origins . " Last Action Hero " was directed by John McTiernan ( " Predator " ) and set back his career a few years ; he found trouble headlining major productions again ( indeed , he also went on to direct the 2002 flop " Rollerball " ) . However , the satire of " Last Action Hero " is sharp and consistent . For anyone who has ever seen an action film , there's plenty to laugh at here - from the movie in-jokes ( I love the F-word bit ) , to the Hollywood / celeb jokes ( loads of cameos ! ) , to the satire of violence and its influence on children , and so on and so forth . The only fault of the film is its ending - the last twenty minutes are a bit sloppy . The symbolism is too obvious ( Jack is brought into the real world ) and doesn't work out so well . It's not horrible , but it doesn't close off the film as well as it should . When " Last Action Hero " flopped in ' 93 , Arnold made a statement claiming his intentions of satirizing violence had backfired and the result made him feel uneasy . He basically said the idea of having a child in the middle of the film's events disturbed him and " didn't work out " the way he had planned . I beg to differ . I think it works brilliantly , and if you're a film buff , you should appreciate this underrated movie all the more . It's one of Arnie's most daring and unique films - how ironic that it was one of his least successful motion pictures . In fact , it's all the more ironic that a movie satirizing the banality of Hollywood fails to make a fuss at the box office .
431121	1173088	814129	10.0	An amazing expansion of the Half-Life 2 story	I've read some people criticizing Steam on places like Amazon - and giving the game poor reviews simply because of that - and in fact Steam hindered my enjoyment of the first game because it took so long to install and slowed down my computer . . . but if you can look past Steam and judge these games for what they are , they're amazing ! Originally planned to be an expansion pack called " Aftermath " ( I actually preferred that title ) , the video game makers at Valve decided to pull a George Lucas and release continual expansion-pack-like standalone games ( that is , you don't need Half-Life 2 to install this add-on - it's an add-on in story only ) . The Valve engine is upgraded a bit with better texturing , lighting and so on . The graphics in Half-Life 2 were amazing , but now it's even better - Dog's motion in the beginning is eerily realistic , as are the facial expressions of characters in the game ( one of the downsides of the realism of HL2 was its poor facial expressions for characters ; this game is fully textured and , for example , when Alyx smiles you can actually see her gradually move her lips - it's almost creepy ! ) . The game takes place right after the events of the last game and has Gordon and Alyx trying to escape the city before the core explodes . The first few levels are a nice twist because you have to complete them in pitch dark with a flashlight and a gravity gun . One thing I enjoyed about this game however was that Alyx stays by you most of the time unlike in the second game when she would suddenly disappear for silly reasons . It's more like a partnership and as such there is actually a good amount of character development in this game - making it a truly surreal experience for any video game ; I felt like the characters were real people , and even the dialogue isn't that bad most of the time ( although Barney is somewhat cheesy ) . The beginning is great , and the only mistake is that they start you off with the blue-powered ultra gravity gun and then downsize you to the regular gravity gun afterwards . It feels anti-climactic . I understand why they did this , but I would have preferred they just left it out at the beginning because once you are running around zapping people into the air , to suddenly be stuck with nothing is a bit sudden and disappointing . The middle goes on a bit too long and the level in the hospital gets old pretty fast . Other than that the rest of the game is basically superb and just as good as the last game , only shorter . There are a lot of " cut-scenes " where not much is happening - but I actually found them entertaining and made me feel more submersed into the game itself . The ending is fantastic and leaves you really wanting more . I can't wait for the next installment and I'm really , really glad Valve decided to release these in segments rather than having to wait , as they said , twelve years for Half-Life 3 . If you enjoyed HL2 , you'll love this - just be forewarned it only takes about five hours to complete . . . but what would you expect for $15 ? I think the price is worth the first level alone .
430083	1173088	80678	10.0	A beautiful , strange , touching , bittersweet and ultimately haunting true story , well-told and respectful of Merrick without " cheapening " the tale .	Few films capture " true stories " as well as The Elephant Man . Although there were , of course , certain artistic liberties drawn ( as with any film based on actual events ) , David Lynch respects Joseph Merrick enough not to present him as a monstrous caricature of a man . ( You may be wondering why I do not refer to Joseph Merrick as John Merrick . . . well , his real name was actually Joseph , but was changed for the film as its screenplay was based on correspondence letters between Dr . Frederick Treves and Joseph . For some reason , he altered Joseph's name in the letters to " John " at some point in time . No one's sure why . ) John / Joseph Merrick had a rare disease called Proteus Disease , a congenital condition . It made him appear hideously deformed and unrecognizable as a man . Of course , in today's age of scientific reasoning , Joseph would have been provided with great care ; however , in 19th century Victorian England there was still a heavy reliance upon superstition and , to a certain extent , religious influence upon the public's perception . Because Joseph was so disfigured , everyone figured he was either being punished by God or he was a murderous monster . ( In fact , at one time he was a potential suspect in the Jack the Ripper killings in Whitechapel , based simply on his physical appearance . It's actually an interesting theory they proposed - that he had taken out his sexual frustration upon prostitutes who rejected him - but the simple fact remains that no one in Joseph's condition could have ever managed to perform those murders . Still , it's an interesting addition to the legend and John / Joseph can even be seen briefly in the Johnny Depp film " From Hell , " which is based upon the Jack the Ripper case . ) John Hurt does a truly wonderful job portraying Joseph Merrick . His performance is captivating because it hints at innocence beneath the hideous appearance - proving the age-old saying " beauty lies on the inside " . . . it's a touching performance and one of the few that brought me close to tears . For what it's worth , as convincing as the makeup effects are in this film , the real Joseph Merrick was far worse looking . There is actually a picture available on Google Image search ; if you take the liberty of looking for it , you may be shocked . The real Joseph Merrick was born in Leicester in 1862 and began showing signs of deformity at age two . He was eventually forced to live with his father , who did not want the child , and sent him out onto the streets to earn money . Because no one would hire him , he decided to star in a carnival attraction as " The Elephant Man . " When sideshows were outlawed in the UK in 1886 he traveled to Belgium to find work and was mistreated by a showman . In due time gained a friendship with Dr . Frederick Treves ( played by Anthony Hopkins in the film ) , a physician at London Hospital . He was finally given proper care and actually ended up drawing the attention of many rich Victorians of the time , including the Queen herself . Joseph died in his sleep in 1890 . Because of the size of his head he could not sleep horizontally , but the film proposes he tried to just once in order to imitate normal sleeping patterns of other humans . Others claim he was trying to commit suicide , which I somewhat doubt . In July 2003 , a doctor named Charis Eng took samples of Merrick's hair and bone and determined that he had suffered from Proteus syndrome , and not neurofibromatosis , as initially suspected . Of interesting note , although Merrick's skeletal remains are now on display at London Hospital , Michael Jackson reportedly tried to purchase Joseph's remains in 1985 to add to his " private collection . " The less said about this , the better . David Lynch seems an odd choice to direct this tale for obvious reasons - he is typically associated with the more bizarre , but The Elephant Man is actually quite Lynchian . Its cold , macabre layering provides a nice texture to the film . It's not unabashedly sentimental . It doesn't pull any cheap tricks . Lynch , as usual , keeps a certain distance from the viewer . . . and for once it pays off in a drama and makes The Elephant Man seem like a sort of macabre tale - which works to the film's advantage because it IS a rather macabre and depressing ( if bittersweet ) tale . This is my favorite Lynch film that I have seen so far and it's a pity that it isn't more highly regarded by those in the film industry . Although it made a bit of a fuss when it came out in 1980 , it seems by today's standards it has drifted into semi-obscurity and its influence speaks more than the film itself . However , I think this should be required viewing for any film lovers . Technically it's beautiful - the black and white compliments the eerie undercurrents and the direction and performances ( particularly Hurt and Hopkins ) are very good . On another level ( as an emotional experience ) it doesn't resort to the type of controlling sentimentality that , say , a film such as Forrest Gump might . It is less manipulative , and as a result , far more honest .
429732	1173088	88846	10.0	" 1984 " Redux - a Gilliam masterpiece , clever and cynical .	Note : I originally submitted a review of " Brazil " two years ago . I gave it a negative rating . I didn't like it . I said it was " weird , " silly , and ruined by a lousy middle-section . Then I began my Gilliam fix and became more familiar with his work . I saw " Brazil " again and liked it much , much more and came to appreciate the dark humor . The story is about a worker named Sam Lowry ( Pryce ) , who exists in a futuristic hell and is sent into a downward spiral after becoming caught up in the affairs of a mysterious dream woman ( Kim Griest ) and a couple of mistaken identities involving a man named Harry Tuttle ( De Niro ) . This is what I wrote of " Brazil " in 2003 : " The beginning of the film is fairly good , with good atmosphere and visual effects , but Gilliam soon takes us into the mind of Lowry halfway through the film , and it turns into a grim psychological thriller with a bunch of dead ends and forgotten ideas . Sam's dream sequences , which have him dressed in an angelic armor with big white-feathered wings , are beautiful to look at . . . but what else are they good for ? " I disagree with this now . It's true , the film changes courses - but for the better . I guess I didn't really " get it " the first time . The film features an all-star cast , including Bob Hoskins , Ian Holm , Michael Palin , and of course Mr . Robert De Niro ( who is second credited but does nothing but three or four brief cameos in the film ) . I will freely admit that I saw the European version of " Brazil , " which reportedly varies from the original US theatrical cut in a number of ways . There is an added sex scene , the ending is different ( no clouds ) , and there are at least five scenes added to the version ( it stands at some 140 minutes compared to the 131-minute US cut ) . So with that in mind , perhaps I'd enjoy the director's cut even more . In fact , there are supposedly somewhere around 30 versions of the film out there , including a " happy " version aired on network television in the States ( it reminds me of " Gremlins 2 , " when the announcer claims that " Casablanca " is now complete with " a happier ending . " ) , and a 97-minute " Love Conquers All " version , handled carefully by Gilliam and available for the die hard fans on the soon-to-be-discontinued Criterion Collection DVD .
430345	1173088	36342	10.0	One of his very best - I've loved it since I was a child !	" Shadow of a Doubt " may only be listed as # 181 on IMDb's " Top 250 " list , but in my opinion it far outweighs some of the films higher up on that list and is one of Hitch's very best films . Joseph Cotten plays Charlie , a crook on the run from the police . Left stranded and pursued , he decides to move in with his brother's family . His niece - who loves him and sees him as a sort of perfect role model - at first is excited that her Uncle Charlie is coming . . . but then things start to get strange . Charlie acts oddly and , at times , violent . She begins to become suspicious of her uncle as he becomes more suspicious of her own awareness . The ending of " Shadow of a Doubt " is classic Hitchcock and some of the best stuff he's done . The entire film is taut and suspenseful , well-filmed and realistic . It manages to focus on family ties and the struggles within the family itself while it also juggles the whole theme of an outcast family member . In the end , however , it's just a nail-biting thriller that - now over sixty years old - still reigns as one of the absolute best of its genre .
430556	1173088	71315	10.0	One of the best film noir / homage films ever made !	" Chinatown " is so good , it's scary . Jack Nicholson is Jake Gittes , the iconic private eye hired to spy on the husband of a woman who suspects he is having an affair . What Jake soon uncovers is a vast conspiracy involving local tycoons and water - heading towards a great conclusion with a classic surprise ending . " Chinatown " might not be the best film noir ever made but it is certainly one of the best . Like " Indiana Jones " it is a loving homage to its source - in this case movies of the 1930s , 40s and 50s such as " The Maltese Falcon " ( most obviously ! ) and lesser-known film noirs such as " D . O . A . " ( which no one else I've seen so far has mentioned in comparison to this , but it does have its similarities ) . Nicholson is absolutely superb in his role , playing Jake with all the touch panache of an instant classic anti-hero . This was certainly a movie of the 1970s , with its anti-hero being the guy we come to root for . Robert Towne is a genius and I may seem to be giving " Chinatown " loads of fanboy praise but I can honestly say that I'm not obsessed with it in any way , in fact I've only seen it a few times . But it's just a really , really great movie that's perfect in just about every way - direction , acting , screen writing , cinematography , editing , sound . . . the list is endless . Polanski deserves as much praise as Towne I suppose , because his direction is flawless and very noir-ish . ( If that's a suitable description . ) Overall , this is a classic - for good reason . After seeing this and " L . A . Confidential " within a few days I can say with confidence that " Chinatown " is much better , and will probably be more fondly remembered years from now .
430141	1173088	289765	10.0	Returns to the Roots of the " Lambs " . . .	Prequels are messy things . Sequels can be , too , but with a sequel , the filmmakers are creating new ground . In a prequel , the filmmakers are treading into pre-recorded territory , and if they're not careful , they can make the audience feel cheated . But with " Red Dragon , " prequel to " Silence of the Lambs " and " Hannibal , " the audience doesn't feel cheated at all . In fact , it is handled extremely well , and is not only a gripping thriller , but a superbly-performed one , also . It stars Edward Norton as forensic specialist Will Graham , the man responsible for putting Hannibal " The Cannibal " Lecter , as seen in " Silence of the Lambs , " behind bars in the 1980s . The film fades in somewhere in the mid-1980s , where Graham starts to suspect that Hannibal may have something to do with the disappearence of a musician . Will confronts Hannibal , who stabs him in the gut and slowly rips open his stomach . Graham fights back , pushing an arrow from Hannibal's study / den through Hannibal's chest and shooting him some two or three times with a handgun . Hannibal is arrested and thrown in jail . Graham is left in critical condition . Flash-forward " a few years later " to Graham living somewhere in Florida with his wife ( Mary-Louise Parker ) and son . Graham still carries the scar from his last meeting with Hannibal , and it has forever reminded him of his job and just how careful he must be . But then comes along Jack ( Harvey Keitel ) , who asks Graham to take on a new case . . . There is a serial killer on the loose who attacks every full moon . He cuts his victims with shards of glass , then takes the glass and puts the pieces in their eye sockets . He also does some other things too grisly to mention in a family review . Graham , the best-of-the-best forensic specialist , agrees to take on the case , and becomes more intrigued by it and makes it his personal agenda to bring down the killer , known as " The Tooth Fairy , " or the " Red Dragon " ( hence the title ) , who is played by Ralph Fiennes . But as the case becomes more misleading and confusing , Will finds himself seeking the advice of Hannibal the Cannibal on his particular case . And as Will faces his greatest fear , the clock ticks until the next strike by the Red Dragon . Fans will be pleased to know that Hannibal has lost none of his creepiness since " Silence of the Lambs . " Fans will also be pleased to know that after the " Hannibal " flop , " Red Dragon " returns to the roots of the original . I thought that " Hannibal " was proof the series ' creepiness had outstayed its welcome . Hannibal's persona only works once , apparently . . . well , if you think that , you're wrong . Because " Red Dragon " is equally as frightening as " Silence of the Lambs , " if a bit more unrealistic at times . And it's also a bit more typical for its genre in some respects than " Silence . . . " , but it's still very thrilling . In fact , the ending could be considered predictable , but it's not for two reasons . 1 . Unlike other horror films where you just KNOW the killer's still alive , " Red Dragon " really makes you think the killer is dead , but the surprise is . . . can you guess ? 2 . In most of the horror films out there , when the killer is supposedly dead , there is a moment of happiness and the film seems as though it is over , but you know there's just something wrong with the abrupt end to the thrills . It shows the family at home , extremely happy , until . . . the kid who went inside to get food hasn't returned . The parent goes in to look for him , and the answering machine clicks on . A cop at the station says , " He's not dead ! Get outta the house ! " Big surprise : The killer's upstairs with the kid , holding a knife to his throat . All this happens in " Red Dragon " one way or another , but you don't feel as cheated as you do watching other thrillers of the same kind . If anything , " Red Dragon " follows a lot of the typical horror / psychological thriller routines , but it's hard to notice . " Red Dragon " does jump through all the hoops of its kind , but if anything , it comes across fresh and thrilling , and this is all I ask for in a thriller . stars - John Ulmer
430895	1173088	109686	10.0	I laughed , I cried , and I think my IQ dropped . I love this movie !	The Marx Brothers . Laurel and Hardy . Abbott and Costello . Jerry Lewis . Every generation has their dose of silliness . The 1990s had Jim Carrey . And along with him came the phenomenal hit " Dumb and Dumber , " a simple tale of two numb skulls who journey to Aspen in search of a woman and happiness . Our tale begins when Lloyd ( Jim Carrey ) is escorting a young woman named Mary Swanson ( the gorgeous Lauren Holly , who Carrey eventually married and then divorced ) to an airport . He falls in love with her in the few minutes they share in the limousine , and after he has dropped her off , he watches her from the outside in his limo and sees her leave behind a black briefcase on the floor inside the airport . Rushing inside , he grabs the briefcase , only to find someone closing the gate to her plane . " It's okay , I'm a limo driver ! " he yells to a ticket checker , rushing down the airport jet way and running straight off of it , falling onto the cement runway below . After retreating to his apartment , he convinces his pal Harry ( Jeff Daniels ) to come with him to Aspen to return the briefcase to Mary . Harry , the smarter one ( or is that dumb-less one ? ) , at first hesitates , and then reluctantly agrees , and so they are off . Little do they know that the briefcase they carry is actually ransom money that Mary was trying to pay to get her husband returned to her . Now with hitment on their tail , Lloyd and Harry make it to Aspen only to wreak even more havoc . Comedic timing is everything in a comedy like this . Carrey and Daniels have chemistry and timing . Check out the scene where they are at the National Preservation Society Gala , and stand at a bar in bright , tasteless suits . The way they stand , talk , and interact is as if they really are bosom-buddies , two idiots without a clue . The film is directed by The Farrelly Brothers , Peter and Bobby . You may remember them as the men who brought us the hilarious " There's Something About Mary . " But truth be told , " Dumb and Dumber " is even better than " Mary . " Whereas " Mary " was a fun summer comedy with big laughs and tons of crude sex jokes , " Dumb and Dumber " is a true comedic gem , and carefully borders the line of tastelessness and taste , something " Mary " crosses over and never turns back to . Is this movie " dumb " ? Yes , absolutely . Will it offend you ? Perhaps if you're a snob . And I'm sure some film elitists will complain that there's nothing substantial or of artistic merit here . I don't think it matters . This movie is meant to entertain and it does so wonderfully . In the past I've given negative ratings to films of the same genre that are just meant to be brain-less , silly fare ( such as " Me , Myself & Irene " ) - the difference here is that " Dumb and Dumber " manages to come across as both likable and entertaining , while still managing to feature characters we can actually , in some crazy way , find ourselves liking . In the end , this is just a very funny movie that is well-made and memorable - much more so than some of its other 1990s " stupid-comedy " counterparts .
429672	1173088	99653	10.0	One of my favorite films - - still moving and touching . . .	It's hard for me to truly understand why a film such as " Ghost " appeals to my inner moviegoer so very much . Here's a film so full of clichés and tired ideas that somehow - - miraculously - - manage to stay fresh , presenting us with a great love story amidst an intriguing backdrop of murder and revenge . The only problem with the movie is Demi Moore's haircut , but that's an entirely different matter . The story is classic : Sam ( Patrick Swayze ) is a successful accountant earning the big bucks in the big city . He's got it all : A great job , a great apartment , a great girlfriend to share it with , and an overall great life . Curled up in bed with his girl , Molly ( Demi Moore ) , he watches a news program stating that an airplane crashed and everyone aboard the aircraft died . " Just imagine , " he says . " In an instant - - just like that . Bam . " He is , of course , referring to the instantaneity of death . The irony in the situation is that we all know the same thing is about to happen to him , and indeed it does , when Sam is shot dead in front of Molly by a mysterious stranger who runs off into the night . Sam dies immediately , and it takes us a few moments to realize this - - since we continue to see him run after the killer . It's then that it dawns on us : it's his ghost . Unable to make contact with the living , Sam follows Molly for weeks preceding his death . ( This is where that " SNL " skit came in - - " Oh , Molly , don't do that , it's disgusting ! There's a tissue right across the room ! " I've got a bit more info on that later on . ) However , Sam soon realizes that his old friend and fellow accountant ( Tony Goldwyn ) had hired a man to shoot Sam because he had seen evidence of money laundering in one of the accounts . Now , in order to warn Molly of possible danger , Sam enlists the help of a psychic hoax ( Whoopi Goldberg ) to pay a visit to Molly and tell her the truth about everything . " Go away ! " she yells as Sam taunts her with obnoxious songs until she agrees to tag along and go visit his old girlfriend . It's useless to delve any deeper into the plot , since it's all pretty predictable . But in all honesty , it's a fun ride getting to the end . This is a film that uses a tried-and-true formula of good vs . evil to achieve its goals . It's as old as the days and as true as nothing . I'm reminded of that speech about principals by Donald Kaufman in " Adaptation " : " This works , and it has through all recorded time . " No doubt he had " Ghost " in mind when he said that . ( I'm just joking . ) I do like the way " Ghost " uses its ideas of a ghost coming back to haunt his killer in a way different than most films , though . This ghost's intentions aren't to scare away people in a haunted mansion , but rather to reach out and touch the woman he once loved , and then - - finally - - to keep her from harm by seeking revenge on the baddies who plotted against him . I like the way one of the villains gets trapped in a bathroom and glances at a steamy window . The word , " Boo " suddenly appears as if someone was writing it , and with a scream the criminal flees the room and runs out into the street outside . If this were a horror film , the window gag might creep us out a bit and give us a chill or two . But " Ghost " uses the old ghost clichés - - haunting people , making writing appear on windows , etc . - - and makes us re-think them . Maybe that bartender from " The Shining " wasn't just a creepy old ghost . Maybe he was just having a bit of fun with Jack . Or . . . maybe not . That's where the film succeeds , I think : in its ideas , even if they have been done before . I also enjoyed Patrick Swayze's performance . Swayze is often ridiculed as an actor , and this caused him to sink back into the depths of unemployment for a number of years - - now appearing in co-star roles and low-budget films - - but I think he's a good actor with a likable on-screen personality . And he doesn't take himself too seriously , which is always a good thing . ( Anybody see that Hans and Franz skit on " Saturday Night Live " about ten years ago ? Utterly hilarious . How about the " Ghost " parody ? ) Okay , so Whoopi Goldberg didn't deserve the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress . Everyone knows it was just because the Academy was in a certain mood that year , where it felt that it had to give its appreciation to the black community of filmmakers , but it's a done deal and the movie is still a good love story , regardless of whether or not one of its actresses didn't deserve an award for her work . ( On a sidenote , Goldberg's performance is quite fun - - still , no worthy Oscar material , I soundly agree . ) I must confess with a bit of shame that it is one of my all-time favorite guilty pleasures - - the type of movie that puts me in a good mood every time I watch it , and a movie with an ending that makes my throat choke every time I see it . The ending really is perfect , and if the movie had resorted to a silly " I came back from the dead ! " bit , my high opinion of the film would surely be somewhat less enthusastic than what it is today . You can't always say that many movies are really beautiful love stories , but here's one .
430648	1173088	112281	10.0	Not as good as the first , but a decent sequel . Hey , it could've been worse !

429589	1173088	118883	10.0	One of my favorite mystery / thrillers	A great movie to watch . . . . . . . is that sentence a conspiracy against you to see this movie ? Did the government tell me to write this ? That's what it's like through the eyes of Jerry Fletcher . A taxi driver who sees conspiracies in EVERYTHING , even in money . The opening scene with the people in the cab is great , all the " conspiracies " he warns them about . . . It's great . From Richard Donner ( Lethal Weapon 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 ) , come Conspiracy Theory , a movie that teaches you to trust no one . This movie deserves about 7 . 1 stars I'd say , not 6 . 4 , like IMDB has . the voters must not have really paid attention to this movie because it's great . The plot is conspiracy freak Jerry Fletcher ( Mel Gibson ) , for some reason can not seem to stop watching over Alice Sutton ( Julia Roberts ) , and he is always telling her about his new conspiracy theories , and she never has the heart to tell him to just go away . So one day Jerry ends up being kidnapped , and put in a torture room , where he is being asked questions by Patrick Stewart ( X-Men ) ( I won't tell you what his name is in the movie because it might ruin a little bit ) . After he escapes and tells Alice , who thinks he's crazy , they both end up finding themselves in a grand conspiracy , that leads to one of the best climaxs I've ever seen . Mel Gibson is perfect as the paranoid Jerry Fletcher , who has locks even on coffee cans in his fridge ( which also has a lock ) . Julia Roberts does a pretty good job as Alice Sutton as well . Patrick Stewart was good as . . . . . I'm not going to tell you but he was good . And The movie had an excellent script , and the characters interacted wonderfully together . It's a great film , and I'm glad it wasn't filled with loads of F-words like other R rated movies . It's actually a good film for kids I'd say 12 and older , it's really not all that violent . I thouroughly enjoyed this movie and I definately recommend it to you . stars
430974	1173088	95016	10.0	Have a " Blast " Watching " Die Hard " !	Die HardOne of the most full-out action movies of all time . It had the best formula , the best dialogue , the best stunts , the best characters , and the best explosions . " Die Hard . " Bruce Willis plays John McClane , a recently divorced cop who travels to LA for the opening of his wife's new workplace , Nakatomi Plaza , owned by a rich Japanese man . His wife ( Bonnie Bedalia ) is happy to see McClane come , and we feel that they want to get back together . Perhaps this opening party will do it . But then it happens . As John takes a trip to the bathroom , a gang of terrorists ( headed by Alan Rickman ) take charge of the company building , demanding money . John hides out in the building and tries to think of a way to get the bad guys . They have no idea that John McClane is loose in the building , and only realize that someone is out there watching them when an elevator shaft is blown to pieces by Willis . Pretty soon , the LAPD , FBI , CIA , and just about anything with three or more letters is outside , and only one man has contact with John McClane from the outside - Reginald VelJohnson , a cop with a walkie-talkie . This is , without a doubt , Bruce Willis ' best film . By far . His personality fits the persona of John McClane . It's fun watching him , for once . The formula for this movie is what makes it so great , however . Think about it . A man , trapped in a building with some bad guys ; a one man army . The perfect action flick formula . But what makes it even better is the non-stop action and excellent , adrenaline-packed explosions and gunplay . People can criticize this movie for being unrealistic , but everyone needs an escape from reality once and a while . One of my favorite parts is where John grabs a fire hose from the top of the building , ties it around himself , and jumps off the edge of the building , smashing into the outside of the glass . Yes , it is very unrealistic , but I'll be darned if it isn't fun . Reginald VelJohnson , of TV's " Family Matters , " is perfect as The Cop on the Outside , having contact with The Man in the Inside . VelJohnson has mainly gotten supporting roles in films over the years . These credits include " Turner and Hootch , " " Die Hard , " and " Die Hard 2 : Die Harder , " which was more of a cameo than anything else . Regardless , he is a good actor , and it's too bad his career has been so bad lately that he has had to resort to his old days by re-doing his character from " Die Hard " by voicing him in a PC game . It's sad enough when actors resort to videogames , but it's even sadder when video games only want you because of an old character you have played and not because of you , yourself . Of action is your specialty , see " Die Hard " as soon as you can . And if you don't like action . . . well . . . there's always " Gods and Generals " for you !
