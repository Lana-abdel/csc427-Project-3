430842	1173088	116654	1.0	Unwatchable .	How bad is the 1996 remake " The Island of Dr . Moreau " ? Unwatchably bad . That's how bad it is . I like Val Kilmer ( " Heat , " " Top Secret ! " ) and Marlon Brando ( " Apocalypse Now , " " The Godfather " ) , but this movie is not only messy , strange / abnormal and downright boring , it is . . . I don't know , I just despise it with a vengeance . Probably one of the worst films I have ever seen . stars - John Ulmer
430719	1173088	165303	1.0	Not the Worst Ever , BUT . . .	Definitely one of the worst films of 1998 , if not THE worst , " The Godson " lacks one fundamental element of comedy : Humor . The cast , including Rodney Dangerfield , Dom DeLuise ( who spoofs Don Corleone ) , and Kevin " Kids in the Hall " McDonald , would make you think this film a riot . However , it is quite the contary . The jokes all fall flat , including the excrutiatingly unfunny " bank " skit , that just went on and on until I was squirming out of my chair - not from boredom ( well , not ONLY because of boredom ) - but because like many of the " jokes , " it outstays its welcome to a point of discomfort . Overall , this movie is one of those films that should be seen only if you're in the mood for it . Which SHOULD be never . stars - John Ulmer
430255	1173088	118688	1.0	Could have been better . . . much better	NOTE ( / 04 ) : This was one of the first reviews I wrote on IMDb . Excuse the spelling mistakes and stupidity herein . = = = = Wow ! I never knew a trilogy of movies that were horrible compared to the original . I mean , Batman was great , Batman returns . . . too dark . Batman Forever ( which I regrettably bought thinking it would be good ( ( which is why I rent movies first now ) ) was okay . . . a little too dumb , and again dark . But Batman and Robin is a movie that you can truly pick out and say , " That movie is a piece of crap . " Chris ' O Donnel , Uma Thurman , Alicia Silverstone , and even George Clooney acted hoorible in this film ( although that's pretty normal . . . ) . Schwarzenegger was perfect as Freeze though , he brought the classic Batman character Victor Frieze to life , and added the cold chill to his voice , and am I the only one who thinks Uma Thurman is ugly ? ? ? When " Batgirl " drops in at the end and Clooney says something like , " Who's this ? " and she replies , " HE-HE , It's me Bruce , Barbara ! " I nearly screamed out in laughter . I mean all she has is this 2 inch long bat shaped mask . You can practically see her entire face . Chris ' O Donnell was once again loud mouthed and horrible actor , and I had to think what WAS with these stupid attempted one liners like , " Chicks dig the car " , or George Clooney's , " This is why superman works alone . . " the only ones I found funny were Arnold's , like " Okay everyone , Freeze ! " , and the way he spoke with intelligence . Overall I think the only part I liked was at the end . . . SPOILERS AHEAD . . When Freeze is put in the same jail cell with Poison Ivy , after he found out she tried to kill his wife ( who is frozen in a test tube during the movie , because he's trying to find a cure for her disease ) , and he walks in and you just see his outline of blue , and see her scared expression ( which is pretty fake looking ) . Then he says something fancy and starts laughing . And the only thing I liked about the ending was how you see Freeze , in a way had a righteous anger ( in a way , though I'm not saying freezing a city justifies it ) , but it was righteous in a way , and in the end he gets to still work on his wife's disease cure at the jail , and he gives Clooney the cure for Alfred's disease . Too bad it was a bit corny the way Clooney acted talking to him about it all . Overall I give Batman and Robin 1 and a half / 5 stars . PS Why call this movie Batman and Robin , instead of Batman and Freeze , or Batman and Batgirl , Because Robin was already introduced in Batman Forever , why didn't they call THAT one Batman and Robin ?
429209	1173088	120737	1.0	Good , but not the best ever .	I'm not exactly sure how this got number 1 on the top 250 on IMDB , I liked it but I wouldn't say it's the best movie ever . It was a good remake of the books , even if they did leave out Tom Bombadil and the whole forest chapter . That always happens when they bring movies to the big screen . But Peter Jackson did a good job of bringing Middlearth to life . The cast was great , especially Ian McKellen as Gandalf the wizard . With outstanding special effects and scenery , Lord of the Rings : The Fellowship of the Ring , is not only nice to look at , but also to get involved in . Although it was 3 hrs . long and a bit slow paced towards some scenes , that's what I'd expect from a remake off a book like TLOTR trilogy . 3 and a half / 5 stars
430333	1173088	299712	1.0	One of the worst films I've ever seen - not even Mickey can save it	I watched this on TV because the digital cable guide listed it as a film " starring Mickey Rourke . " Little did I know all he had was a very brief cameo in the film , yet it was enough for them to advertise his name all over the listings . In fact it actually stars a Tom Cruise lookalike named Daniel Cosgrove who suspects little bugs ( cockroaches and that sort ) are planning to take over the world . The film is shot in a gritty , blue-filtered way - like those TV cop shows ( Law & Order , NYPD Blue , The Shield , etc . ) but the problem is that the " reality " feel of the movie betrays its utter absurdity - - please , LITTLE BUGS ATTACKING THE WORLD ? ! What is this - - the 1950s ? ! The worst scene has to be the very ending ( SPOILER AHEAD ) when all the little bugs " form together " to create one giant , enormous " bug " that attempts to kill the hero . The way he " kills " it is laughable at best . It's not worth watching - not even for Mickey .
430062	1173088	95897	1.0	You know how you've heard this movie is really bad ? Well , whoever told you that is RIGHT . . .	" 48 Hours " - - two mismatched cops . " Red Heat " - - two mismatched cops . " Lethal Weapon " - - two mismatched cops . Do we really need any more entries into this genre ? No . But at least the preceeding films had either a level of wit or chemistry - - perhaps both - - that made them quality entertainment . " The Presidio , " a cop-buddy film with Sean Connery and Mark Harmon , is nothing special at all . It's routine and boring , and if that wets your lips then dig in . Mark Harmon plays a Chicago cop brought in to investigate the murder of a fellow officer of the law . Sean Connery is his Scottish partner , a hard-nosed fellow with an attractive daughter ( played by Meg Ryan ) who takes a liking to Harmon ( by matter of script cliches ) . They hit it off much to the chagrin of her father , who continues to be paired with the young American . They end up in the usual car chases and on-foot pursuits . Action purses around just about every corner . There's a chase where Harmon is leaping over the hoods of cars and Sean Connery is dragging behind , looking very much out of breath and tired . But this is a boring film - - one that put me to sleep in the first minute and , from the looks of it , many other people , too . Connery tries hard to fight against the material , but Harmon is the film's primary flaw - - he's like Kevin Costner on sleeping medication . Meg Ryan is the typical sweet Girl Next Door love interest , but she would display much more acting skills in the next year's " When Harry Met Sally " with Billy Crystal . The script leaps all logic . It's as bleak , dry and typical as a film in this genre can get . I expected a nice source of entertainment in this film . It not only does not entertain , it literally repulses the viewer . Sean Connery and Mark Harmon have no chemistry on-screen . They pretty much just run about screaming at each other . Sean Connery has the Straight Man role that Arnold Schwarzenegger , Danny Glover and Nick Nolte have all played before . Which leaves room for the Comic Loose Man . But Harmon isn't a comical guy , and he isn't as loose as he is just plain ignorant . This is a poor example of buddies . The movie was directed by Peter Hyams , who obviously needs a lesson in how to properly construct a fast-paced and engaging cop-buddy film . This movie suffers from lack of pace and lack of solid direction - - one of its biggest flaws apart from casting decisions . Not only that , but the writer , Larry Ferguson , needs to take some lessons in how to cross the boundaries of a regular script and breathe into his characters life . There's a difference between written characters and typed characters . His are in the latter category . The movie is 97 minutes long and it feels two times longer . I recently saw a buddy flick called " Hollywood Homicide " with Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett . Even that film was better than this - - and " Hollywood " is making my list of the worst films of 2003 . Only really big fans of Sean Connery should venture near this . And the fans of Mark Harmon should all be taken out to a field and shot . stars . - John Ulmer
429984	1173088	107034	1.0	" The Good Son " is a " good " example of how not to make a " good " thriller .	" The Good Son " is a " good " example of how not to make a thriller . Not only is it stupid , it's disturbing seeing filmmakers having an eleven-year-old kill people . The film starts out with Elijah Wood going to live with his Aunt and Uncle after his mother dies , because his father has a business deal in Japan ( or something like that ) . Upon arrival at his relatives ' home , he meets Macaulay Culkin , who makes a startling appearance in a mask . The boys become friends , but Wood starts to see things happening . Culkin kills a dog with a nail-gun he created . And then he tries to kill his sister ( numerous times ) . And then we find out that years ago , Culkin's little brother drowned in the bathtub while Culkin was looking over him ( we find out later he killed the boy because his brother got one of his toys - - a rubber duck - - and he wanted it back ) . So then Wood has to convince everyone that Culkin is a homicidal maniac with serious problems before the sister dies . I read a review of Roger Ebert's on this film , and it's exactly what stuck out at me when I originally watched the film : What kind of filmmakers have a small child in a role where he is killing people ? Especially when the film has with a kid killing off his family members . It's just wrong to do when children are at that young an age . And furthermore , why cast Culkin ? Macaulay Culkin is one of the worst child actors I've seen in a long time , and luckily his reign has ended . Now we have Haley Joel Osment , who actually has gained the honor of being a good child actor . Let's contrast between the two , shall we ? In " The Sixth Sense , " Osment delivers many speeches where he cries or acts frightened . In " The Good Son , " Culkin delivers a speech to Wood while they are standing at the refrigerator . He mumbles every badly-written line helplessly . He stares at Wood , motionless , without facial expressions . He looks like he's reading his lines off the top of Wood's forehead . Now , you could say his part calls for no emotions , but this kid ALWAYS has that look on his face in ALL his movies . I mean , other than his role in " Uncle Buck , " the kid just can't act . " Home Alone " was a good film . . . but not because of him . That was due to a great script and great supporting cast . And that's it . " The Good Son " is not only disturbing , but very mediocre in what it is . It's just like all those eighties so-called " thrillers " that came out that were no more than 90 minutes of basic chills . The script is awful . But one of the worst things about this film is the fact that it seems written for / by children . . . yet it is in no way suitable for children . At all . It's a sick , twisted film that tries to be both a thriller / chiller , and a kids ' movie . It's neither . stars -

Diane Keaton stars in " Crossed Over , " an overly-sentimental film that does not even make an attempt to become anything more than a giant , television " soap " film . Diane Keaton gives no great performance compared to some of her past work , and the rest of the cast members are boring . The direction is confusing and drags out endlessly . I was enthralled when the credits finally started to roll . So many scenes that should and could have been left on the cutting room floor weren't , so instead we are stuck with a two hour soap-fest . I find it hard to believe that the film stays completely true to the book it is based upon , which in turn is based upon real events . I don't really have to go into how preachy and politically correct this film is . It's kind of a no-brainer . Though , I must say , I didn't expect something like " Crossed Over " to be as preachy as it was . " Crossed Over " is another forgettable television film with good potential but an all-too-familar and boring script . stars - -
431131	1173088	278191	1.0	The novelty has worn off fast	I used to watch " Fear Factor " every week when it first started airing because it was a unique reality show ( a genre I hate to begin with ) and kind of interesting . It seemed daring and I enjoyed watching the contestants go through all the crazy challenges , it was sort of fun in a guilty pleasure way . But enough is enough . Joe is really milking his whole hosting experience for what it's worth - - appearing , ironically , on " Got Milk ? " ads . Ten years from now he'll be sitting in a dumpster wearing a " I Was A Reality TV Show Host " T-shirt . The show has simply become a bore - the novelty has worn thin . They keep trying to introduce " new " challenges but after you've seen a few , you've seen ' em all . Once in a while they get really sexy babes to strip to their underwear for underwater challenges , which is just plain sad , shameless exploitation for the sake of gaining a wider audience and attracting viewers . Then they'll have the special " Fear Factor : Victoria's Secret Episode " where they have supermodels playing the challenges . Joe always looks like he's really enjoying himself during these episodes . " Fear Factor " used to be fun but nowadays I've found it's just pretty lame . It's not interesting anymore , it's not amusing , and it's simply not as unique as it was four years ago .
430925	1173088	103644	1.0	The worst of the series , and one of my least favorite sequels . Truly disastrous . No wonder Fincher and everyone associated with it has disowned it since its release . . .	In its complexity , " Alien3 " is a failed story . It's bleak , it's flawed , it's stupid . " Alien3 " is a sequel to two of the most memorable films of all time - - and it completely ruins the ending of its 1986 predecessor , " Aliens , " by killing off two of the lasting characters and entirely negating the emotional underpinning of the film . It practically scratches out the second movie with its mediocrity , and the fourth scratches out the first . In its simplicity , it sucks . If you recall the ending of the last film , Ellen Ripley ( Sigourney Weaver ) survived her encounters with an alien colony , along with the marine , Hicks ( Michael Biehn ) , and a young survivalist much like herself named Newt ( Carrie Henn ) . They were put into cryogenic sleep and all was well . The story ended happily and should have stayed that way . It was the ending we all loved . Now it's ruined . Ripley is picked up by a large space ship another number of years later . She is the only survivor . The spaceship suffered a malfunction . Hicks bled to death and Newt drowned in her cryo chamber . But Ripley believes that Newt may have been impregnated with a chestburster after finding traces of acid on the floor of the ship . That's a problem with this film . Everything's contrived . I was willing to believe that Ellen Ripley could and would encounter aliens once again in the film " Aliens " because the plot was strong , so any minor contrivances set up by James Cameron were not very noticeable . It was a very good sci-fi film , and the more I view it on the new Quadrilogy DVD , the more I grow to like it . Same with " Alien3 . " The new cut is better than the old one . But it's still an awful film - - so bad that everyone associated with it has only bad things to say about it . Even its director , David Fincher , has reportedly disowned the film . He claims that the film is not his , that FOX controlled every aspect of it . He was the only director on the entire Quadrilogy DVD collection to refuse a DVD commentary track recording . " Alien3 , " even with the superior extended version , still stinks to high heaven . Fincher can disown the film all he wants , but he still made it . The " Alien " series was always dark and brooding and somewhat disturbing , but this pushes the limit - - it's too dark , too brooding , too disturbing . The characters are extremely strange and weird ; Ellen Ripley is very different , and her new hairstyle - - no hair - - is just silly . This whole film is just too dark . Another problem ? There's nowhere to go after " Aliens . " In 1979 , " Alien " introduced the new face of horror a year after John Carpenter's " Halloween . " The two back-to-back slasher flicks were both very different and yet very similar . One took place in the future , one in the present . Both were films about killing creatures ( for Michael Myers is not a human ) . And so to change the genre , in 1986 James Cameron made the sequel an all-out combat film , preparing audiences for the change with the tagline , " This time it's war . " He wanted people to know that it wasn't " Alien . " It was " Aliens . " " Alien3 " is infamous for its awfulness . It is the movie no one wants to claim credit for . Not Fincher , not Hill , not the producers , and not even FOX , really . It made a lot of cash , but for the most part everyone hated it . Some die-hard fans enjoy it , but if you ask them , they'll always tell you that it's the worst of the series ( sometimes they choose " Alien Resurrection , " though ) . I'll tell you what : It's certainly my least favorite . I hate this movie . I literally find it painful to watch . And I wouldn't even call myself a huge fan of this series . But it bugs me when directors take liberties to kill off characters . The story of James Cameron's hatred for " Alien3 " is pretty well known . Some people say he needs to get over it . Now he's talking about making a sequel with Ridley and forgetting about the latter two sequels . I don't think this is a good idea ( forgetting the other two - - it would confuse audiences ) , but I don't blame him for despising " Alien3 " and often referencing it as an awful film in his interviews .

430192	1173088	445934	3.0	Am I missing something here ?	When I saw the ads for " Blades of Glory , " I knew what to expect - another funny satire from the Frat Pack lads that wouldn't be anything great but would be filled with some good slapstick and at least have a handful of memorable gags . Well , I was wrong . Although the approach is similar to comedies such as " Talladega Nights " and " Dodgeball , " it's definitely the worst film I've seen so far of the " Frat Pack " series of films . It just isn't funny . The problem is that the film is largely a one-joke premise . And it's poking fun at something that is more obvious than something like NASCAR or unpopular like the game of dodgeball - figure skating is such an easy thing to lampoon , but after five minutes of sight gags and jabs at the sexuality of the sport , where is there to go ? A plot is formed : Will Ferrell is a bad-boy figure skater who , taking advantage of a legal loophole , joins forces with Jon Heder's androgynous super-skater to win the gold medal . Will Arnett and Amy Poehler play a brother-sister duo who become the mandatory Evil Overachievers and attempt to destroy the two skaters by having their sister ( Jenna Fischer ) go " undercovers " and break up the two men's relationship on the ice . The plot is weak , and the movie knows it's weak , but that's not much of an excuse when your material isn't funny . I once loved Will Ferrell but I've quickly grown tired of him now - his shtick is becoming tiresome . At least Ben Stiller knows how to change various elements of his performances and can create something very funny like White Goodman in " Dodgeball " - but Ferrell is just playing the same shtick here that he's been doing for his last few films : an arrogant buffoon who squints his eyes a lot while acting dramatic , yells at people , and says stupid things that he doesn't realize are stupid while keeping a straight face . It was hilarious at first , but now it's really old . Even a lot of the jokes are recycled . The movie mocks the intensity of those mini-biographies that appear at sports events and awards shows - too bad it was already done ( far better ) in " Zoolander . " I also must say that I find Jon Heder to be quite annoying and I don't think he's a very talented comedic actor . It would have been much funnier to see Ferrell paired with someone of talented background - I'd even take Stiller playing his naive-type character again in place of Heder . Will Arnett is WASTED - he was so hilarious on " Arrested Development " and his presence here is thrown away . Jenna Fischer has achieved a level of recognition on " The Office " in the U . S . - but this film proves that she won't have much lasting power . She has no absolutely no presence on screen and her character is so thin , unrealistic and - worst of all - totally bland that she comes across as being more insulting than the transparent love interests in Adam Sandler's early movies . Fans will attack me for taking the movie too seriously . That's not the case . The problem is that the film mistakes being silly for being funny - like Monty Python minus their brilliant wit . The movie is so focused on being silly that it leaves its brains at the door , and that's the problem : recycled gags , unfunny and repetitive visual jokes and poor acting really sinks this . I suppose in the right hands it could have been a very funny sports parody like " Dodgeball " ( which managed the balance of wit and silliness far better ) but they really missed the mark on this one .
430632	1173088	63036	4.0	Hugely disappointing	Brian De Palma , Robert De Niro in his first movie . . . it has to be good , right ? That's what I thought . But I was hugely disappointed . " GREETINGS " is no more a comedy than SCHINDLER'S LIST . I didn't laugh a single time , nor grin or smile . It has one good gag , at the very end of the film , and if it had maintained that wit throughout I would have given it a higher rating . However it starts off very poor and only gets worse as time goes on . Made on a shoestring budget , and it shows in every scene . Continuity errors galore . De Palma , who edited the film , clearly has no handle on editing and literally jumps around from scene to scene . So , in one segment a group of characters are talking , and it suddenly jumps to fifteen minutes later in a different room , and they're still talking , and we're left wondering what on earth is going on . I only really wanted to see this because of Robert De Niro . I am a die-hard De Niro fan and will watch anything with him in it ( I even sat through SAM'S SONG , which is even worse than this - by a long shot ) . However De Niro - despite top billing - is not in this film very much , and when he is , he's not very impressive . ( Although he hardly does a bad job , either . ) I couldn't believe De Palma was responsible for this film , it lacks all the typical Hitchcock trademarks of his . However , there are a few references - characters discuss the film BLOW-UP ( 1966 ) which he of course later loosely remade into BLOW OUT ( 1981 ) and at one point a female character subtly picks up HITCHCOCK / TRUFFAUT from a bookshelf and begins to read it . However the rest of this film lacks his typical visionary edge and I suppose it's because he was still learning ( and that's clear in every frame ) . De Palma , never a friend of the MPAA , seems to push the boundaries a lot in GREETINGS and for the most part it's totally unnecessary . The whole subplot about De Niro's peeping-tom habits are disturbing and make us dislike his character - which is a problem since the sequel ( HI , MOM ! in 1970 ) revolves entirely around his character . ( And for the record , GREETINGS was the first film awarded an X rating , which says something about its content . It's not too explicit nowadays , but we're left wondering WHY De Palma had to cram so much unnecessary sex and nudity into his film , because it seems like it's just there for the sake of being controversial - and almost 40 years later it is not controversial anymore , which makes it all the more outdated and pretentious . ) Overall I was hugely disappointed in this movie . It's not funny . It's sophomoric , with stupid editing and direction ( just watch the scene where De Niro and co . walk down a street and De Palma puts it in super-fast-motion - what the hell was he thinking ? ! ) . That , plus an unbearably outdated ' 60s overtone ( and you thought EASY RIDER was outdated ! ) and truly awful theme tune ( it sounds like the Beatles on drugs ) , make GREETINGS a truly disappointing experience .
429752	1173088	120577	4.0	Could have been much better	" 54 " is a film based on the infamous " Studio 54 " of the 1970s - the hangout for the social elite and party clubbers . In the film , Ryan Phillippe is the main character , based on an actual employee of Studio from 1977 - 1982 . The film's problem is that it's all glitter and style and no substance . It tries to be a really grimy and probing satire like " Boogie Nights " but ultimately comes across as an inferior wannabe . Mike Myers is given the thankless task of playing cocaine-snorting club owner Steve Rubell . It's only a slightly comedic role and if this was Myers ' best attempts at sliding into drama like Lemmon and other comedic actors did in their time , it's a total failure . " 54 " could have been insightful and interesting but instead it's just another dumb teen flick that isn't entertaining or even remotely engaging . View at your own peril .

Not very funny , and as much as I enjoy watching James Belushi do his thing in comedies , he doesn't work as a leading man in a spy caper . Watching him tote a gun and rescue hostages is sort of sad . This is not very funny and is a poor imitation of " True Lies , " released the same year .

Now it's come out that she / her book / tabloid magazines claim Roger Vadim used to make her have threesomes with other women . Somehow , it seems appropriate given the nature of this movie . It's intended to be an erotic adventure and the opening credits depict Fonda cruising around floating through her space craft absolutely naked . That's really all the movie is . Fonda running around ( or floating around ) wearing little , if anything at all . If that's your sort of thing , you'll probably dig this . Otherwise , stay far , far away .
430516	1173088	115697	4.0	think that people should realize in the future , that just because a comedian is fat he is NOT John Candy !	' Black Sheep'In this basic rehash of ' Tommy Boy , ' an equally unimpressive comedy , David Spade plays an election aide who must watch over a candidate's brother , Chris Farley , a chubby , loudmouthed , obnoxious , loose cannon . If Farley gets in the spotlight for anything bad , like he usually does , the candidate's hopes for election are slim . So , Spade has the thankless task of hiding out with the fat man in a cabin somewhere in the middle of nowhere . But , of course , since this is a comedy , Farley gets away , and Spade , who cannot tell him why he's hiding him without hurting his feelings , drags along after Farley trying to convince him to come back . . . or something like that ? Despite being directed by ' Wayne's World ' director Penelope Spheeris , this film's very basic and juvenile comedy is nothing good . At all . The jokes ( if you can call them that ) almost all fall flat , and I rarely laughed . David Spade's character is a bland , dull , lifeless and immobile creature who we could not care for one way or another , no matter how bad things get . Chris Farley is just plain annoying , as always , with his off-the-wall antics and loudmouthed ' jokes ' that are more outbursts than anything else . I sometimes wonder if fellow ' SNL ' comedian Mike Myers was playing for more than just a disgusting character when he created Fat Basta ^ & ? for ' Austin Powers ' ? ' Black Sheep ' is the kind of movie that no one is talking about the next day . It is utterly forgettable and very , very , VERY basic . It's not an awful comedy , mind you , because I have seen much worse ; however , there is really nothing to recommend about ' Black Sheep . ' People said Chris Farley was the next John Candy , but John Candy will never be matched . John Candy's comedic talent lay in true comedy . He could make us laugh while making us cry . Candy was a good ? great ? comedian . He had all the traits of a one-in-a-million kind of actor . Farley , on the other hand , gained his laughs by making stupid outbursts , like ' I bought a kite from a bald guy ! ' that are so odd that people laugh at not because they are funny , but because they are odd . People should be glad that Farley died , because he would have worn out with America , just like David Spade did ; unfortunately , even good ' Saturday Night Live ' comedians like Dana Carvey , Kevin Nealon ( Hans and Franz ) etc . are all dying out . It's too bad that comedians who are usually remembered for being great are people like Farley ? annoying , loudmouthed slobs who hadn't an ounce of real comic talent in them . I think that people should realize , in the future , that just because a comedian is fat he is NOT John Candy . stars ? basic comedy ? John Ulmer
429966	1173088	468996	4.0	A poor imitation of " The Osbournes " - but not as funny or original	At one time during the 1980s Hulk Hogan was one of the most popular figures in the entertainment industry . He was a famous wrestler who tried to branch out into films ( and failed ) with numerous projects . As the ' 90s came and went , Hulk's fans faded out - and by 2000 he's nothing more than a has-been . So what better way to boost his popularity again than start up a new reality TV show about Hulk and his family ? Hey , I've got an idea - we could call it " Hogan Knows Best , " which doesn't really make any sense . ( Are they implying Hulk is a mother ? ) The show is a carbon copy rip-off of MTV's " The Osbournes . " A few years ago MTV camera crew followed Ozzy , Sharon , his daughter Kelly and son Jack around in their multi-million dollar mansion . Now VH1 is doing the same thing with Hulk . What's lame is that the show is like " The Osbournes " in almost every way - Hulk has a wife who loves dogs , a daughter who wants to be a singer ( and is hopelessly spoiled ) , and a weirdo son . The problems ? Well for one Ozzy is hilarious and fun to watch , whereas Hulk . . . isn't . Give a guy with drug abuse and a deteriorated mind a TV show ? Comedy gold . Give an ex-wrestler who wears a bandanna on his head and wears t-shirts with his own face on them a TV show ? Total crap . Hulk's wife isn't as complimentary to Hulk as Sharon was to Ozzy in their TV show . She comes across as an annoying spoiled princess isolated in her mansion . Kelly Osbourne was annoying but it worked to the show's advantage - Hulk's daughter is just plain bland . And I'm not even going to start on his son . This is essentially a really , really basic ( and really , really poor ) concept for a TV show , and VH1 should be ashamed for thinking they could ever pull this over on people without instantly drawing comparisons to " The Osbournes . " It's a lame , pathetic show and just makes Hulk and his family come across as money-grabbing fame-chasers with no future .
430470	1173088	94500	4.0	Very disappointing	I grew up reading " The Lion , the Witch , and the Wardrobe " and must have read it over five or six times altogether as a child - which is rare for me because I'm not the sort of person who reads books more than once . The novel was clearly intended as a Christian allegory by its author , C . S . Lewis , a devout Christian . I think that's one of the clever aspects . What is not clever , however , is this 1988 TV adaptation . It's just not very good . The acting is subpar , the direction isn't very impressive , the special effects and everything are quite straight-to-TV . I'm not really looking forward to the new film adaptation either but at least the new one may be tolerable ( despite being an obvious cash-in on LotR ) - this one , if you've read the book , is genuinely disappointing . I didn't like it then , I don't like it now .
430212	1173088	372532	4.0	Even as a " chick flick " romantic comedy it doesn't deliver	I went to go see this not having heard anything about it , now knowing what to expect . I figured it would be , at the very least , mildly entertaining and humorous . I'm a sucker for romantic comedies like " Kate and Leopold " and " My Best Friend's Wedding " - - they aren't great movies , but they are good time-passers and sometimes quite funny . I was surprised to find " The Wedding Date " delivers none of the above . It has zero laughs ( literally , I didn't laugh a single time ) , its characters are totally unlikeable and as a result boring to watch - - and worst of all , the biggest crime of any romantic comedy . . . there's no romance ! The film spends way too little time studying its characters and building up their issues . They're just kind of " there " and worthless at that . I felt no sympathy for Kat ( Debra Messing ) , I found her to be an annoying , self-absorbed spoiled rich kid ( check out her parents ' house ! ) and her sister is equally tolerable - - which is pretty unfortunate considering the fact that her sister is supposed to be the " bad guy " ( so to speak ) of the movie ! There's absolutely no chemistry between Dermot Molroney and Debra Messing . Their romance never sparks like Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan or anything half as good as that , even - - it just dwindles and never takes off . Finally all at once they seem to be in love , and it's so sudden that I just sat there and thought , " Huh ? How did this happen ? And WHEN ? " This was Debra Messing's chance to make the leap from television ( " Will and Grace " ) to the big screen , and she fails miserably . Clearly imitating Jennifer Aniston's comedic routine , Messing just walks around saying dumb lines and expects us to laugh . It's not enough . Her character isn't likable . Neither is she , really . If she wants to make it in film , she's going to have to quit ripping off Aniston - - in the beginning of the film , she even has her hair cut the same way as Aniston . It's like " Single White Female , " only really happening . It's a mess of a movie , not even delivering the level of entertainment most romantic comedies do . It's devoid of humor , its characters are annoying , grating and / or unconvincing , and its direction is poor . I understand it's a low-budget " chick flick , " but so was " Four Weddings and a Funeral " - - and look how much better that was .
429566	1173088	99371	4.0	Cole Trickle and his gang are here to PUMP . . . YOU . . . UP !	This film has the worst cast of characters ever . I'm not necessarily speaking of actors , just the names of the people they portray . I mean , come on , Cole Trickle is bad enough ( sounds like a gay hero's alter ego ) , but look at the rest of the names listed in this film : Harry Hogge , Claire Lewicki , Tim Daland , Russ Wheeler , Rowdy Burns , Big John , Buck Bretherton , Waddell , Aldo Bennedetti , Harlem Hoogerhyde . . . It sounds like the screenwriter was too lazy to look up commonly used names so he just used his daughter's bedtime book : Harlem Hoogerhyde ? Buck Bretherton ? Harry Hogge ? DID ANYONE LOOK AT THIS SCRIPT ? ! Didn't Robert Duvall stop and say , " Hey , Harry Hogge sounds like the name of a pig from a lame children's book ! " Apart from the rhyming names , we've got people like Rowdy Burns . Look , here's a hint . If you're making a movie about race car drivers , do NOT name the bad guy " Rowdy . " And don't give him such an obvious last name . I mean , couldn't they have come up with something subtler than " Wheeler " ? How about Harlem Hoogerhyde ? I can't make up my mind . Either he's from Harlem , or he's about to snort a booger on Tom Cruise . What do you think ? Claire Lewicki rhymes with " icky , " and that's never a good thing . Then we finally come to Cole Trickle . This is probably the lamest name in the movie , which is sad considering it's the " hero's . " It belongs in a gay porno flick . And then there's the title of the film itself . . . " DAYS OF THUNDER " ! ! ! Wow , that's powerful ! Unfortunately , it too belongs in a gay porno film . The sequel could be called " The Adventures of Cole Trickle and Harry Hogge : DAYS OF POUNDING . " The only good thing about this film was the inclusion of Guns N ' Roses ' cover of Bob Dylan's " Knockin ' On Heaven's Door " on the soundtrack .
429172	1173088	248667	5.0	Plays too much like a documentary and not a film	" Ali " was one of those hugely-hyped films that just kind of fizzled out once it had been released . So much was built up around its release : Will Smith and all his training he endured to take on the role of Muhammad Ali , director Michael Mann's struggle to get the film made , and of course the very idea of a film bio being made of boxing's most famous legend . The first disappointment is Smith . I like him and think he's a good actor , but he's out of his league here . For starters , he doesn't look like Ali . He has some of the movements and physical expressions down pat , but he doesn't talk like him , look like him , or have the same presence as him . The second disappointment is writer-director Michael Mann . Here's a guy with a great career of films ( from " Manhunter " to " Heat " ) who writes a lazy script and abandons his usual directorial style for a standard TV-drama biopic narrative . It's a huge disappointment . The rest of the cast are all pretty good - Jamie Foxx , Will's wife Jada-Pinkett , Jon Voight and Mario Van Peebles as Malcolm X all acceptable in their roles ( although something tells me the inclusion of Jada-Pinkett was unnecessary and just a way of Will getting his wife into the movie ) - but overall the film's hugest blunder is its choice of narrative , which feels too much like any daytime drama bio-pic and less like a movie . There's no connection , no feelings , no excitement - resulting in one of the most disappointing films in recent memory .
429937	1173088	99165	5.0	Mediocre , not awful .	If you are a fan of Brian De Palma , you already know about " The Bonfire of the Vanities . " This is constantly referred to as his hugest flop and largest disappointment , probably for good reason . Its cast - - Tom Hanks , Melanie Griffith , Bruce Willis and Kim Cattrall - - are hardly unpopular and the material is fairly interesting . What , then , went wrong ? In my opinion " The Bonfire of the Vanities " is just poorly executed . I saw this film years ago and lost interest in it almost immediately . The dark humor grows tiresome and isn't nearly as clever as it thinks it is . Tom Hanks isn't really believable in his role and the whole cast seem to be high on something ; Bruce Willis in particular is giving a really odd performance , and I didn't have a clue what he was trying to accomplish with his character . He's supposed to be a drunk , but he came across as something more desperate . The film follows the events in the life of Hanks after he takes a wrong turn off an interstate highway and ends up in a rough area of the city . His girlfriend accidentally hits a black kid in the street , and they try to cover it up , fearing for their lives . What follows is a satire of something . I'm not sure exactly what because De Palma loses vision of his goal very early on . I didn't know whether to laugh , or gasp in horror . It's a very strange movie . That said , the critics are a bit TOO harsh on it . I would hardly call this the total waste of time some people made it out to be on release . It is widely considered one of the most infamous atrocities of cinema and I don't think it's quite deserving of that sort of reaction . It did push De Palma's career back a few years , though , didn't it ?
429863	1173088	112744	5.0	Not very effective at all .	Sean Penn directs Jack Nicholson in this story of a man who swears to avenge his daughter's death by killing the drunk driver who struck her . The movie opens up with Nicholson's character being a sleazy guy in a strip club and instantly we don't care very much about him , because he treats everyone like crap and doesn't really seem to have much depth . I'm all for unlikeable characters , but not when they're totally unredeemable and of no interest to the audience . The rest of the plot seems very back-and-forth . . . " I'm going to kill him ! " " Wait , I can't kill him . " " I'm going to kill him ! " " But I shouldn't kill him . " When he finally makes up his mind the movie has already lost a lot of its momentum and derails way too early .
430460	1173088	294862	5.0	Okay updated arcade game	QBert is an updated arcade game , much like PacMan . It involves escaping from bad guys from jumping down pyramid blocks . I've played this updated version , and it's not that bad . Worth getting cheap for 5 bucks if you like classic style arcade games . If not , pass .
429919	1173088	388500	5.0	OK , but unnecessary , and what happened to Bacon and Silverstone ? !	I was really surprised to see Kevin Bacon credited for this film halfway down the list . I thought it was just an extended , uncredited cameo . I was almost shocked when I realized he was taking credit for starring in the film - and his name wasn't even near the top of the list ! Ditto for Alicia Silverstone . What's happened to her career ? From " Clueless " the movie to the clueless actress - why is she taking roles like this ? " Beauty Shop " is a spin-off of the " Barbershop " series of films ( which somehow managed to spawn a sequel and this , the spin-off , in a couple years ' time ) and it's a pretty half-hearted flick . Sure , it's kind of entertaining , for what it is , but it's pointless and unnecessary . The first two films were enough ; hopefully there won't be a " Beauty Shop 2 . "
429202	1173088	120716	5.0	Not as good as it could of been , but still a decent movie .	Despite the issues of this movie , it just didn't come out the way it should have . Robin Williams gave a good performance , as always , but the movie itself lacked the dramatic touch it needed . Parts of the story , as well as the lines made the movie more of a dramatic comedy , which doesn't work in a movie like this . If they had kept the drama closer to movies like Schindler's List , Braveheart , and other impressive dramatic films they could have pulled this movie off . They also should've gotten a more dramatic soundtrack , like other great dramas have . Drama is not my favorite movie genre , but in " Jakob the Liar , " they needed more of it .
430854	1173088	202470	5.0	Laughably bad to the point of unintentional self-satire	Marky Mark Wahlberg plays a rock star wannabe who rocks out at rock concerts with his rockin ' girlfriend and rocking friends . He gets into fights with competing rock band members and his older brother , who hates rock music and is a police officer , makes fun of him for being a wannabe rock star . So the titular rock star eventually becomes a real rock star , headlining his favorite rock band as a rock singer . Notice how I keep using the word " rock " a lot ? That's because this movie is inundated with rock - and in a bad way . Hair metal died with the ' 80s - making a retro picture now ? It's not surprising the film didn't even recoup half of its $38 , 000 , 000 budget in theaters . I'm not picking on hair metal , but if you look at Motley Crue or KISS , at least they had attitude . The bands in this film are lame ! I guess Mark thought this would be a good semi-sequel to " Boogie Nights " - he satirized the ' 70s porn industry , now why not ' 80s gratuity ? - but , unfortunately , at the helm of director Stephen " I Haven't Made a Good Movie in Years and Am Still Riding on the Coattails of ' Bill & Ted ' and ' Mr . Holland's Opus ' " Herek , " Rock Star " looks like a laughable , silly picture . Oh , and Jennifer Aniston's annoying performance as Mark's girlfriend only adds to the fun .
429938	1173088	89530	5.0	Annoying and off-key with a family-friendly marketing approach	This is the PG-13 " Mad Max " film which introduced the kiddies into the mix , which is hugely disappointing as the two previous entries were ultra-violent , R-rated action masterpieces ( or so the critics say ) with no little kids in sight . This is like the " Jedi " addition to the series - as if George Lucas got his chubby hands on the script and re-wrote it . " Beyond Thunderdome " is cheesy to begin with ( I mean , Tina Turner as a villain of the wastelands ? C'mon ! ) and adding a group of Peter Pan-styled " lost boys " into the film is the icing on the cake . Essentially what starts out as a decent film ( Max having his belongings stolen , ending up at the Thunderdome , playing gladiator with some thugs in the arena ) quickly descends into mediocrity . I would like the cast to reunite for a hard-core R-rated final installment , if only to erase the bad aftertaste of this very disappointing close to the trilogy .
429686	1173088	158062	5.0	I like how Pamela Anderson is credited on IMDb as a " cinematographer "	If your idea of a good time is watching some druggie rock star bonking a famous Playboy bunny then this " movie " will certainly fulfill you . It is , at least , leagues better than that awful Paris Hilton tape . However , in general , I just have a hard time of finding entertainment in watching two famous people going at it for an hour . Maybe it's just me . Let's give a rundown of what occurs in this film , though : - Pamela Anderson has sex with Tommy Lee in a moving car - Pamela Anderson has sex with Tommy Lee on a private boat - Pamela Anderson has sex with Tommy Lee in her private trailerI'm sure it must have been hard for her to be " cinematographer " while having to perform the sexual acts . I also like how she's credited as " Makeup Artist . " Makeup for what ? Maybe I don't really want to know .
430011	1173088	87225	5.0	Very silly and outdated cash-in , but I used to love it	It's unfortunate that sometimes nostalgia can turn out to be a deceiving pain . I used to watch " The Ewok Adventure " on VHS when I was younger and was a huge fan - I'd view it frequently ( probably even before I saw all the original " Star Wars " films ) and , although I recognized it was cheesy even as a child , I still enjoyed it . Today , it simply doesn't hold up . It comes across as a desperate and silly cash-in on " Star Wars : Episode IV : Return of the Jedi . " The " lovable " Ewoks of that film return here to wreak more havoc - they find a boy and his younger sister after they crash land on the planet . The boy and sister have lost their parents , whom were apparently grabbed out of the space ship by some scary alien creature . The alien creature's special F / X are absolutely terrible which explains why his full frontal view is saved until the ending - which is ludicrous and way over-the-top . If you're a " Star Wars " fan you'll need to own this simply because it's got the Lucas " stamp of approval " - but to any casual viewer it comes across as a desperate and pathetic franchise cash-in .
429472	1173088	102798	5.0	The absolute worst Kevin Costner movie ever made .	Saying a Kevin Costner movie is bad is kind of like saying cheese smells . It just does . To be fair , some of his films have been quite good . . . " Open Range , " " Field of Dreams , " " The Untouchables , " " No Way Out " . . . you could do worse than watch these films . But he's made far more bad films than good ones . . . and I think he's simply a very bad actor and films like this solidify that . It seems Costner has a huge ego and always takes on these " epic " revisionist or revisionist future films like " The Postman " and " Waterworld " . " Robin Hood : Men in Tights " ( err , I mean , " Prince of Thieves " ) is quite similar . It's a whole " new " spin on the Robin Hood tale . And it stinks . ( Almost as bad as cheese . ) The cast is otherwise pretty good . You've got Alan Rickman as a villain and that's always a plus . Sean Connery has a cameo , too . But come on , Morgan Freeman in a Robin Hood film ? I hate to break the news to everybody but Robin Hood didn't have any black pals called Azeem ( if he did then I apologize sincerely but since I read the book and don't recall an African emigrant being mentioned , I'm sticking to my guns ) . I understand they have to have blacks in the film so they don't appear to be " racist . " I'm not racist and Morgan Freeman is one of my favorite actors ever but come on . . . would you put an Asian guy named Heroshima in a film about George Washington and the Revolution ? Would you have him become George's best buddy and offer insightful advice ? NO ! Somehow I just find this film to be quite dull and plodding and over-long . Political correctness aside ( and trust me , there's plenty ) it's simply LIFELESS . . . ironically appropriate given that Kevin Costner's voice never fails to put me to sleep . Overall you could do much better - go watch the original Michael Curtiz version ( one of the greatest ever and certainly the best Robin Hood film adaptation ) , the Disney cartoon ( aw come on it's entertaining ) or the Mel Brooks version . Combined together they're all better than this - which is saying a lot considering Brooks ' " Men in Tights " was a bad film to begin with .
429696	1173088	290226	5.0	Disappointing Look at John Williams ' Music for " Jaws 2 " . . .	I kind of hoped this would be an intriguing look into John Williams and his music . Instead , I got Williams talking about how he doesn't like to do music for sequels but did here - - okay , that's nice , but why doesn't he tell us HOW he gets inspiration for film themes ? Nope , no insights into the man's mind here , just " I don't like sequel music because it's not fun , " then the credits role . It's not entirely bad , but it was disappointing .
430021	1173088	107843	5.0	Does every successful foreign film have to be remade by Americans ?	" Point of No Return " is a remake of the successful French film " La Femme Nikita , " by Luc Besson ( " The Fifth Element " and " Leon the Professional " ) . I've seen parts of the original and thought it was really good . I've seen the remake on TV about a million times ( I haven't actually sat through it each time ) and after viewing it maybe two or three times altogether , I have to say I don't see the " point " ( pun intended ) . There's no need to remake the original . Especially considering it was so successful overseas and a fairly recent release . The remake stars Bridget Fonda as a woman who is recruited to be an assassin . Gabriel Byrne is her recruiter . There's no arguing that they have a pretty good cast - Fonda and Byrne are both good actors - but the sole fact remains that a remake was unnecessary , and the strains of the screenplay show . It comes across as an un-daring , half-baked project that is simultaneously redundant and boring . Catch it on cable ; don't spend your money .
429883	1173088	280707	5.0	Very disappointing .	Robert Altman is one of my favorite directors of all time and his " Player " ( 1992 ) starring Tim Robbins is a great dark satire of the film industry . He's a great genre-swapper and so I expected quite a bit from " Gosford Park , " which I pictured as an Agatha Christie-style period piece . The movie stars Weese Ritherspoon's husband , Ryan Phillipe , from " Cruel Intentions . " That should say something about its acting right off the bat - - mediocre , to say the least . There are a few fine performances , but the bad ones drag them all down . The " mystery " elements of the story are very poor . Instead of building up an atmospheric thriller Altman examines the characters like he's doing " Nashville Redux " or something - - no offense but I didn't go see this to see a realistic depiction of different classes of society in a mansion , I went to go see a murder mystery as was promised on the ads and in that respect I was sorely disappointed . Overall I'd have to say this is one of Altman's weakest and most pretentious films - - it's a huge disappointment and a rather banal example of Altman's typically reliable directorial style . Non-fans of Altman might like it , but I suspect most of his die-hard followers will find it a dubious title in his resume .
429650	1173088	102057	5.0	I can't believe I haven't commented on this yet !	I could have sworn I already wrote a review for " Hook , " but glancing at my review archive just now , I realized I hadn't - what a shock ! I've seen it so many times over the years . . . and each time it grows worse and worse . ( But in a good way , if that makes any sense . ) " Hook " is a terrible film , yes . But in some ways , it's also very good . The ideas that surface are unique - what if Peter Pan grew up ? What if he forgot who he was ? What if , what if , what if . . . ? The movie's stumbling block is Spielberg . This represents his best and worst - it's imaginative ( the good ) but way too bright , over-the-top and exuberant ( the bad ) . Spielberg's liberal impact on the material is always present - he represents the Lost Boys as a pack of minority kids , who ride skateboards and look like they just stepped out of Stereotypical Ghetto Number One . The movie's flashy coloring and vibrant overtones bring to mind his older failures such as " 1941 " - similarly " Hook " is a film that , despite its faults , remains somewhat interesting . The second huge slip-up is casting Julia Roberts as Tinkerbell . Meg Ryan was originally considered for the role and she would have been about a million times better . Roberts is annoying and gives one of the worst performances of her career ( which is saying quite a lot ) ; Ryan's acting skills aren't too great either ( take a look at " The Doors " ) but when she sticks to the right roles she's always great . This would have been one of her perfect roles . I could sit here and criticize this film to all ends but at the end of the day I always find just as much to like . Robin Williams is suitable as Peter and Dustin Hoffman absolutely steals the show as Hook - he delivers the best screen persona of Hook to ever reach the big screen , far surpassing Jason Isaacs in the 2003 J . M . Barrie version in particular . ( I think Isaacs is a great villain in cinema and he was given such little to do as Hook . ) The co-stars are all talented - British veterans like Maggie Smith add class - and the film's on-location shooting in London gives it an authentic feel . Overall I'm giving it a five-star ( out of ten ) rating because I don't really " like " the movie . But when it's on , I usually watch it . I used to own the VHS tape . I think some of the ideas are really clever and the performances are great . It's a shame about Spielberg and his wacky taste for the absurd , but at the end of the day , that's what has helped " Hook " retain its status as a beloved failure over the years - this is the movie everyone loves to hate .
429741	1173088	86465	5.0	OK but too long and not as consistently funny as it probably should be . . .	I just saw Trading Places in its true entirety for the first time in many years . I have often caught various scenes on TV but never sat down and watched it since first viewing long ago . My opinion remains the same . I'm a big fan of Eddie Murphy , a pretty big fan of Dan Aykroyd , and in general ' 80s comedies and SNL - - but this one is a bit too long ( over 120 mins , uncut and unedited w / commercials on television ) - - it does have some very funny sequences and in particular the beginning is great but after that it sort of goes downhill . I thought the plot was incredibly weak and a bit too contrived - - Aykroyd's sudden complete loss of . . . everything was wholly unbelievable . I suppose it could be somewhat believable if not for the fact that Eddie Murphy suddenly replaces him and no one else seems to notice , or care . No business colleagues notice what is going on , etc . Then there's the scene where Aykroyd is walking by the restaurant and sees them all inside . He HAD to know what was going on when he saw Don Ameche with Eddie Murphy . He had to know they had set him up . Why didn't he just go into the restaurant and confront them ? Yeah , it's " just a comedy " or " just a movie " but there's a difference between suspension of disbelief ( which I don't mind at all - - I own Commando ! ) and being downright stupid . It's the little stuff like this I don't like . It starts out as a fairly realistic comedy but is waaay too silly and over-the-top at times . ( E . g . the guy getting put in with a gorilla - funny for a slapstick like Naked Gun , perhaps , but not for an otherwise realistic comedy . ) It would at least be fun if it weren't so long ! There are long gaps were nothing really happens . Many punchlines are clearly supposed to be funny , but aren't . There's an entire scene where Murphy is being given instructions about how Wall Street works and it goes on for about two minutes , before he says " You two sound like a coupl'a bookies to me . " It's supposed to be the punchline to the scene , but it takes so long getting to it , and frankly , it just isn't very funny . Eddie Murphy is usually good at creating likable characters , or at least funny ones , but his character here seemed to just disappear and reappear so often I never really felt as if I was getting to know him - - he seemed more like a co-star . Dan Aykroyd gives a much better performance in general ( or at least he has better material to work with in regards to his character ) . I prefer Beverly Hills Cop ( my favorite Eddie performance ) , The Blues Brothers , Coming to America ( with a clever reference to Trading Places ) and even the mediocre ( but entirely watchable and enjoyable ) Great Outdoors to this . " Trading Places " is OK but certainly not the classic many seem to think it is . It's too long with too many unfunny scenes , the plot is a bit too unbelievable to take seriously , the characters are all over the place and this all creates a cold distance - - it's hard for me to warm up to the movie , I guess .
429614	1173088	396269	5.0	I was very disappointed .	So these two sex-crazy guys decide to crash weddings . They get laid a lot , really easily , and keep doing it . ( Pun intended . ) So eventually one of them actually falls in love with a girl , and meanwhile a nutcase harasses his best buddy . Cue some crude sex gags , a couple of cameos and all the other obvious stuff . The result ? Wedding Crashers , a disappointingly average comedy starring Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn . The movie's plot isn't strong to begin with , but it is taken to an insultingly simplistic level in less than thirty minutes . Once the beginning wears off , the movie gets stuck in a rut ? it turns into a film less about crashing weddings , and more about trying to survive in a wacko's house for a few days without being sexually molested . ( Nope , it's not a Michael Jackson biography . ) Example ? In one scene , a woman molests Vaughn's character , then ? while still strapped to a bed , unable to free himself ? another character who's supposed to be gay begins to kiss him and proceeds to try and seduce him . It's funny at first , but the whole gag is stretched far too long ? once we understand that the girl is a psycho and the kid is gay , it's only funny for so long . Meanwhile Christopher Walken ( who plays a wealthy politician ) is pushed to the background , his character unconvincing , unfunny and unreasonable . Although the role is similar to that of De Niro's in " Meet the Parents , " it's so underwritten and neglected that Walken really just comes across as another vacant face . Vaughn and Wilson have good chemistry ( which we already knew , really ) and they alone make Wedding Crashers suitable entertainment . As a way of passing ninety lazy minutes , it's adequate fluff . But it could have been better ? a lot better . The humor could have been funnier , raunchier , and more daring . The plot could have used less clichés and more spice . Walken and many other characters could have been filled out to their full comedic potential . In the end , the movie is disappointing because it achieves so little . It's one of those films where you're already forgetting it on the way out of the theater . I was hoping I'd at least remember it back to the hotel room .
429176	1173088	116830	5.0	Boring and unimpressive action fare .	Walter Hill used to be a great action director - before he started making crap . " Last Man Standing " is one of those poor 1990s Bruce Willis action movies where nothing really sticks together . It doesn't have the flair and comedy of " The Last Boy Scout " or " Die Hard , " nor is it as well-developed as " Pulp Fiction " or " Twelve Monkeys . " It's basically Bruce running around killing people . The worst thing about this in my opinion is the awful voice-over narration . It tries to fit into the style of the old noir films from the ' 40s and ' 50s , and of course the gangster pictures of the era as well , but it instantly comes across as forced , annoying and hammy . Bruce does his Steely-Eyed Act where he just glares at people a lot and spouts a few lines here and there . It scores a ( about on par with " Mercury Rising " ) on the scale of Lazy Bruce Willis Acting . When Bruce is trying he can be a fine actor ( " Twelve Monkeys " being the standout ) but this is essentially just an ugly , violent , boring , silly homage to the gangster flicks of long ago ; it doesn't really offer anything new and as a result comes across as dull and repetitive .
430587	1173088	112851	6.0	Fun - nothing else	With a cast consisting of Quentin Tarantino , Cheech Marin , Steve Buscemi et al it seems like DESPERADO is the Q . T . Generation Get-Together - Rodriguez would direct Q . T . again next year in the cult " classic " FROM DUSK TILL DAWN and they'd be joined again by Salma Hayek . . . et al . . . the list goes on . Rodriguez uses a lot of the same players in his movies and I'd be willing to give DESPERADO more praise if he had actually refrained from giving Tarantino fourth billing considering his appearance is really just a cameo , and anyone who doesn't recognize him probably hasn't been watching any TV or movies over the past decade . The movie itself is pretty good fun - a sequel to EL MARIACHI with Antonio Banderas taking over the role of " El " the killing mariachi singer . The movie is never quite as clever or great as it could be but it is a good deal of fun in a sort of wink-wink way - you can tell it's just a big guilty pleasure for the cast and all involved are having fun . . . that would carry over into DAWN and again into the third installment of the Mariachi trilogy , ONCE UPON A TIME IN Mexico , which is ( in my opinion ) an even better action movie than this - which drags a bit towards the middle . No PULP FICTION or GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY , but still a decent amount of spaghetti-western-style fun .
430802	1173088	118571	6.0	Very nice action flick !	Although it is very unrealistic , AIR FORCE ONE is just pure , 100 % fun at the movies . Anyone who takes this serious has a problem . It's not meant to be , it's just supposed to be an entertaining , fun , action packed thrill ride . Action haters beware ! The acting was great-as usual with any Harrison Ford film - the directing was good , and it's like I said before , just good plain fun ! So take my advice , see Air Force One , and don't take it too seriously . Just have fun watching it ! stars ! JOHN ULMER
430805	1173088	123964	6.0	A very nice surprise	I recently saw LIFE on tv for the first time and I must say I was impressed and most of all SURPRISED . I expected a very rude , crude kind of humor from such " bad boy " actors like Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence-famous for their constant foul mouthing . But LIFE was more of a comedy-drama , that had some very nice sequences , and thankfully was not filled with innuendos , and such . I do know the film has swearing , even though I saw it on tv I can always tell when they're cutting language out of a film , but it still is not as much as one would expect . If you want to have a fun night watching a good film , rent Life . Even if you're not fans of Murphy and Lawrence ( which I can't say I am ) you will still have a good time . It has an uplifting ending . LIFE believe it or not , is just one of those heart-warming comedy films . Enjoy ! stars JOHN ULMER
429405	1173088	160127	6.0	Delivers What it Promises . . .	" Charlie's Angels " has been taking a lot of heat for being stupid , ridiculous , immature , etc . . . and while it's definitely not a great film , I can't help but half-enjoy it . Cameron Diaz , Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu fill in the shoes of the Angels , from the hit TV show " Charlie's Angels " - - remember that show ? Well , in this film , the Angels must stop a madman from doing something bad somewhere in the world . I'm not really sure what the plot was , because there really is no plot per say . This film is an excuse for two of Hollywood's prettiest women ( Cameron Diaz & Drew Barrymore ) running around blowing stuff up in bikinis . I'd have to say that the only thing that keeps this movie from being a better piece of entertainment is the annoying ( and horrible actress ) Lucy Liu . According to IMDb . com and shows like " Entertainment Tonight " and " Access Hollywood , " Bill Murray ( who played Bosley in this film ) did not return for the upcoming sequel because he didn't like working with Liu . I can't say I blame him . Just the sight of her ugly face on screen makes me cringe . I remember an interview with Murray back on the set of the original film , and they asked him about alleged arguments with Lucy Liu on set . He said the accusations were false , but I could tell he was lying . But apart from her , the cast is quite ensemble . The hilarious Bill Murray keeps this film from becoming nothing more than a bikini advert , and the enjoyable Tim Curry helps Murray a lighten the mood a bit in one of the scenes . Sometimes the film uses very odd filming techniques , and " McG , " the director , seems to try and go too much for a modern look . But , in a way , it gives the film more of a summer-flick feeling than anything memorable , which is all I want " Charlie's Angels " to be . The person going into this expecting Oscar-material has a screw loose . This movie is a lot like the film " MI : 2 " ( " Mission : Impossible 2 " ) : it delivers a whole lot of action for a nice night in . It's a summer flick , and nothing more . Pure Entertainment . Maybe a bit whacky at times , but nevertheless entertaining and fun , regardless of some flaws . stars - John Ulmer
429250	1173088	187078	6.0	A Surprisingly Good Car Flick . . .	With other films like " The Fast and the Furious " coming out around the same time " Gone in Sixty Seconds " did , I expected " Sixty Seconds " to be another forgettable car chase movie hyped up on testosterone . I was wrong . " Gone in Sixty Seconds " turned out to be a surprisingly good car flick with a good car chase at the end . I definitely recommend it - - especially if you're sick of other car film like " The Fast and the Furious , " which are just adrenaline pumped films with no real car chases worth remembering . . . It's not a " great " action film , but it's good , and in my opinion the best car film of 2000 when compared to " Furious " . Nicolas Cage , Angelina Jolie and Robert Duvall star . stars - - John Ulmer
430781	1173088	376006	6.0	Entertaining character study , but a flawed one .	First things first . So far this film has about an average vote of stars on IMDb , which I think is kind of surprising , because it's not that bad . I expected about a 5 or 6 rating . Yes , it's muddled and kind of pointless at times , and the ending is pretentiously ambiguous . But as a character study - - despite it's flaws - - it is a rather effective one that manages to explore the love triangle between two older people and a younger teenager . The movie's casual treatment of sexuality involving adults and a 15-year-old is kind of disturbing at first , but kudos to Alan Brown ( director and writer ) for getting away with it . He handles it right - it never nears exploitation - and as a result the story doesn't seem cheap and tacky like " Intimacy . " However my problems lie with the script itself . It's got too many repetitive moments and some scenes are kind of wandering and make you say , " Huh ? " The performances are alright . The only actor I recognized in the cast was Gregory Smith ( " Small Soldiers " ) , playing a fifteen-year-old , which is kind of silly because he looks about 20 ( at the least ) . I suppose they had problems with younger casting because of the love scenes between the leads . Essentially the story centers around three people in a small town - a 30-something high school teacher , his wife , and a local kid - and how their friendship soon turns into something else . The kid has an affair with the wife , the husband finds out , and hatred forms . It's an interesting movie because it's daring and different , but it has its flaws - a stronger script , better cast and more responsible and experienced director would result in a much better picture .
429865	1173088	339135	6.0	One of the rare GOOD Van Damme movies	Call me a cynical person but I think all Jean-Claude Van Damme movies suck . I don't watch them . I don't find staring at a semi-muscular man kickbox people and promote mindpower over violence , then turn around and kill fifty men with the strike of a single finger , particularly entertaining . However in 2003 Van Damme dropped this image by starring in a prison movie which seems like it could be a true story . . . the warden has them play cruel games and pits them against each other for the sake of his own enjoyment . Okay it's a bit like a bit between " Gladiator " and " The Shawshank Redemption . " It's even got a black character like Morgan Freeman and Van Damme is supposed to be the equivalent of Andy Dufresne ( Tim Robbins ) . There's even a scene towards the end of the movie where they're sitting outside against the exterior of the jail wall . It's pretty obvious they're drawing similarities . Nevertheless Van Damme gives a strong performance ( Wow ! I never thought I'd say that in a million years ) and handles most of the scenes well . Even if it's not the best prison movie to hit the big screen ( or small screen ? ) it's better than I thought it would be .
430616	1173088	131325	6.0	The Con is On - And a Funny Con it is !	" Bowfinger " PLOT SPOILERS ( If you don't want to know the plot BASIS , do not read ; however , there are no spoilers per say ) . . . ' Bowfinger ' starts out with Bobby Bowfinger ( Steve Martin ) , an unsuccessful movie director who has oddly enough , at his ripe old age of forty-five , never directed a movie . Every week he puts a dollar away into a little tin to save up for his first movie . Well , now he has bills up to here and debts to pay , and some promising actors to satisfy with a script . And he's got the perfect script to make it all come true : ' Chubby Rain . ' It is about aliens coming down from space in raindrops , hence the name ' Chubby Rain . ' And Bobby Bowfinger has the perfect man for the film . He can already see the tagline ( well , I can , at least ) : ' And there is only one man who can stop them . Only one man who is an instant moneymaker , audience-attractor and action-hero . Kit Ramsey . ' Eddie Murphy plays Kit Ramsey , a successful billion-a-film movie star who has been having some paranoid delusions recently . He goes to a therapist whenever he sees these visions , and the therapist calms him . But he has no idea what he is in store for . After Bowfinger tries to contact Kit in an effort to attract him to the ' Chubby Rain ' script ( to no avail , obviously ) , Bowfinger hatches a ludicrous plan . A plan that might just work . Who says actors need to know that they are in a movie ? What if they were just . filmed , staged ? What if you sent an actress up to an actor on the street , told the actress what to say , and filmed it . It could come across that the actor she is talking to is part of the movie . And that is exactly what Bobby Bowfinger does . He films Kit without Kit knowing he is filming him ( it all sounds so confusing , but it really isn't ) . But after Bowfinger's actors go up to Kit and speak to him on the street , Kit thinks that the actors are aliens , and his therapist puts him in a secret mental hospital ( rehab ? ) unit . Bobby Bowfinger is left without an actor . So now , the game is on , as Bobby must find a Kit look-a-like . Fortunately for Bobby , he has just found Kit Ramsey's dorky , nerdy twin Jiff : a braces-boasting , gum-chewing , thick-rimmed glasses wearing , loveable freak . But there are more surprises just around the corner for Bobby , as Kit is released from the mental rehab unit and is chased by Bowfinger's actors again , leading to the film's climax . ( ' Got you , suckas ! ' ) Well , now I will evaluate the cast , because the cast of ' Bowfinger ' is very ensemble . Steve Martin is great in his role as Bowfiner , a hassled director who must resort to an all-time low of filming . But what is great are Martin's dumb-grin expressions throughout the film that make him look like a little child . I have now seen two Eddie Murphy films in two nights : ' Bowfinger ' and ' I Spy , ' his performance in both surprising me . In ' I Spy ' he fit Kelly Robinson like a glove , using his loudmouth antics to full advantage , for once . In ' Bowfinger , ' Murphy uses his talent to his full advantage as well , convincingly pulling off an egotistical actor and nerdy geek . Heather Graham plays an actress wannabe who sleeps with every man on set of the movie to get her way ( s ) . Robert Downey , Jr . has a small role as a film producer ; he is in the film in the very beginning , about five seconds in the middle , and at the very end . I'd estimate his screen presence at about four minutes total . Jamie Kennedy plays Bobby Bowfinger's assistant and friend ; he works in a back-lot film studio . To help film the ' Chubby Rain ' movie , Kennedy's character ' borrows ' film equipment from the film studio and returns it to them before night . Kennedy was very good in this movie , as he is in his television show ' JKX ' ( The Jamie Kennedy Experiment ) . Now , on to the interesting aspects of the film : ' Bowfinger ' has some very interesting and hilarious sequences , including one segment where Bowfinger is having Kit run across a traffic-packed highway during rush hour for the movie he is filming . Hands down the best scene in the film . The movie also has some interesting ' con ' ideas , which are very provocative and thought provoking . For instance , Bowfinger sets a camera in a large tree-clipper truck , sets Kennedy up there , drives on a highway and films Kit Ramsey in his car , who is being chased by one of Bowfinger's actors . Who would ever think of that ? Only Steve Martin , the writer of this film . The thing that makes this movie so funny is the fact that Kit Ramsey has no clue whatsoever about what is going on . One of Bowfinger's actors ( the guy who wrote the ' Chubby Rain ' script ) walks up to Kit and , using a special prank , cuts off his own arm ( of course it's a fake arm , but Kit thinks it is real and runs away ) . Unfortunately , believe it or not , I was overall a bit disappointed in the movie . Yes , it is a clever parody of the film industry , and it was not a bad film at all . It was quite funny . But frankly , I was expecting more laughs after reading so many good reviews and finding out Martin wrote the script . stars - John Ulmer
429618	1173088	119807	6.0	An entertaining comedy with good performances .	An average every-day Joe ( Tim Robbins ) arrives home from work one day to find his wife in bed with his boss . Shocked and upset , he travels to a local ghetto - where a thug ( Martin Lawrence ) tries to carjack him . However , he no longer has any concern for his own well being and calls the carjacker's bluff - traveling from California to Arizona , eventually stopping at a gas station . The two bond over time and devise a scheme to rob money from a safe belonging to Robbins ' boss . The movie's main interest to me is that it had been directed by Steve Oedekerk . ( If I spelled his name wrong , I apologize , because I always seem to . ) Oedekerk is a very funny guy and has written and directed some unique comedies - unfortunately most of his mainstream stuff has been unsuccessful so far . " Ace Ventura II " wasn't a failure but " Kung Pow : Enter the Fist " was a complete flop ( I for one enjoyed it ) . Despite his faults , Oedekerk is consistently different - " Kung Pow " was unique and ambitious . " Nothing to Lose " doesn't really come across as one of his movies , but nevertheless it is quite entertaining and does what it intends to do . Some scenes are a bit too long or just not very funny , and Lawrence and Robbins don't have " Lethal Weapon " style chemistry . But it's good enough for the movie , and their performances overall are fine . Although it borrows some ideas and themes from older films like " Fun with Dick and Jane " as far as the vault robbing goes and ( dare I mention it in one of my reviews yet AGAIN ) " Planes , Trains & Automobiles " so far as the road travel blunders go , it's a good movie that just doesn't try hard to be anything it isn't - it fits nicely into its groove and entertains while causing a few chuckles .
430190	1173088	478311	6.0	I can see what people admire and praise about it - but I think some are going too far .	" Knocked Up " is a well-made , enjoyable comedy about the consequences of an unprotected one-night stand . It has dual lessons for its lead characters : Seth Rogen has to learn to grow up and accept responsibility and Katherine Heigl has to choose between a professional life as a television interviewer or a possibly less rewarding ( as she sees it ) life as a stay-at-home mom . And because it's Judd Apatow , he handles the sex gags carefully and with enough maturity that it doesn't become another stale sex comedy . But I think some people jumping on the Apatow bandwagon are so eager to praise him as the " Savior " of the sex-comedy genre that they are overlooking some of the film's flaws . First of all , if we're going to be picky , the comedy isn't very consistent . Which is OK - I'd prefer it that way - but when you see reviews touting it as " the funniest movie of the year , " expectations can't help but build . I didn't think the acting was as good as in " The 40-Year-Old Virgin . " Seth Rogen is a great supporting actor - but I find him rather irritating as a lead character . His revelation at the end of the film , too , isn't very believable - they spend so much time focusing on his life as a slacker that the transition between him being a man-child and accepting responsibility is as realistic as a " Rocky " training montage ; he has a heartfelt talk with his dad ( Harold Ramis ) and suddenly he's 100 % willing to become committed . Okay . I'm not a big Heigl fan , but she fit the role well here . Paul Rudd was the real scene-stealer , though . But he's thrown off-balance by the casting of Apatow's wife - can he PLEASE stop putting her in all his movies ? She can't act . Overall , this is an OK comedy - better than most of its genre - and the drama is more realistic than most sex comedies , but some people were so willing to jump on it as a " masterpiece " of its genre before it even came out that the hype just killed it for me .
430881	1173088	242423	6.0	Dude , Where's My Brain ?	Ashton Kutcher , of TV's " That 70's Show " and Sean William Scott of " American Pie " stature , have teamed together for what some would say a " Bill and Ted " comedy , but I would have to say a " Dumb and Dumber " trip in itself , without half the laughs . First off , let me say I think in a way , this film is underrated . What were people expecting , Citizen Kane ? But then , we can compare it to other comedies , and we find ourselves wondering how a film like this could be made . It's a real hit or miss , and there are more misses than hits , but sometimes , just sometimes , there are some funny moments . At the scene with the blind child and the " blind people handshake , " I could detect some Farrelly brothers humor , and I would not be surprised if the writer ( s ) of this film were trying to take after their idols , Bobby and Peter Farrelly . However , this is not near as funny as Dumb and Dumber , and if you though that film was bad , you'll hate " Dude , Where's My Car ? " It is in no way for those easily offended . I don't like when people say this is a rip-off of Bill and Ted . It actually isn't ; " Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure " had many more laughs , and the main characters weren't high on pot the whole way through the film . I would have to give this mindless , wandering film stars . It's not as bad as some say , and not as great as others speak of it . John Ulmer
430623	1173088	259711	6.0	Better than expected , still doesn't hold a candle to the original though	" Vanilla Sky " suffers from a bit of mainstream Americanalization . ( Is that a word ? I don't think so , but oh well . ) It's the US taking a popular and successful foreign film ( the Spanish " Obres Los Ojos , " a . k . a . " Open Your Eyes " ) and re-working it with . . . Tom Cruise in the lead ? " Vanilla Sky " is , then , the ultimate cliché of the America / remake fascination inherent in most mainstream Hollywood films these days . People on this site love to bash Hollywood for doing this - they consistently take foreign films and remake them with popular American names . Casting Cruise is a bit too much of a cliché to be true . He's America's most popular actor alive ( statistically , anyway ) . Surprising , then , that the movie isn't bad . In fact , it's quite good , at least in a watchable sort of way . Although it doesn't hold a candle to the original , Cameron Crowe ( " Fast Times " scribe and " Jerry Maguire " director ) is still pretty capable behind the camera and Cameron Diaz proves she has some amount of acting abilities as she portrays a character unlike any other in her resume . The big disappointment is Penelope Cruz , returning to her role in the Spanish film , only this time playing it in English . And she's not very good at speaking English and we have to wonder , " Why did they cast her ? " Plus , and maybe this is just me . . . but I don't find her very attractive . Between her and Diaz , I'd take Diaz , even if she was a suicidal maniac . Overall I was rather entertained and amused by the film , even if it's nothing special . And believe me , it's not . But Tom Cruise is better than expected . And his notorious vanity pays off - - we finally get to see his face all messed up . Alas , he can't remain like this for the entire duration of the film . That would be American Hollywood sacrilege . I can just hear the producers : " Tom Cruise playing a facially disfigured man ? WHAT ? ! "
429699	1173088	119174	6.0	Hitchcock Would Be Proud - - If it Didn't Have So Many Darn Plot Holes . . .	Conspiracies . Films tend to be made about conspiracies and mysteries . Everyone has conspiracy theories that they put in movies ( " JFK , " " Conspiracy Theory " ) . " The Game " is a different kind of conspiracy . It is about an entire organization holding something against one man . Only a few people know about this organization and what it does in the movie , it seems . But if only a handful of people know about the organization , how could it possibly get booming business ? That's one of the many , many plot holes that " The Game " seems to have . It just has too many plot holes to save itself . It has a pretty good plot , good acting , good directing . . . even a good script . . . but the plot holes in the script cause the problems . Michael Douglas plays a rich businessman , whose birthday is coming up soon . Sean Penn , his younger brother , tells Douglas that he ( Penn ) has bought a present for Douglas called " The Game . " Douglas goes to the location of The Game Headquarters ( it has a name but I can't remember right now ) , and there he finds out that The Game Headquarters must test Douglas ' health before they activate it ( The Game ) . They ask him questions , do health tests . . . all of this going to use later . . . and then Douglas goes to dinner . At dinner , one thing leads to another and pretty soon things start happening . A hysterical Penn tells Douglas that he didn't have enough money to pay for The Game , and now The Game is coming after him . So now Douglas is caught up in this conspiracy which he may never get out of alive . Because now they're coming after him . Blackmail is only the beginning of what they'll do to Douglas . First of all , " The Game " has a nice setup . I really enjoyed the beginning . It holds a great sense of suspense , and seems to be filmed effectively , in a very suspenseful way . It has all the markings of a Hitchcockian thriller . Unfortunately , Hitchcock would have ironed out the plot holes before he filmed the movie , because despite being a suspenseful film , the plot holes are unbearable , kind of negating all the suspense and belief in the film . SPOILERSFirst of all , how does The Game know that Douglas is going to do everything he does ? They're betting an awful lot that he will jump off the building at JUST the right spot to crash through JUST the right glass ( if you've seen the film you'll know what I mean ) . I can't exactly go into the entire film - - it would spoil the entire thing - - but the plot holes in the movie are just too obvious . They are literally betting on every step Douglas will take , and while they have people to help him make decisions along the way , there are times that he is by himself . . . how do they know , in a moment of despair , he will not try to put a gun to his head ? At the end ( major spoiler ahead ) , Douglas stands on the edge of a skyscraper with a gun . They make it look as though Douglas has just shot his brother ( by accident ) . Douglas , on the verge of a mental breakdown , walks to the edge of the skyscraper and jumps . Here are two things . 1 . How did they know Douglas wouldn't just lift the gun to his head and blow it off ? Why jump off the building ? Yeah , I know , that's what his father did and therefore Douglas would do the same - - but what if he hadn't ? If I were Douglas ' character , just because my father jumps off a building doesn't mean that that would be my decision of effective suicide . 2 . What if Douglas had jumped off the wrong point of the building ? What if he all of a sudden , before anyone could do anything , he decided to run off the other end of the building ? And even if he jumped off the building at the right point , what if a ) the wind ( there could be some strong gusts from that high up ) blew him away from his destination , and b ) from that speed , even fake glass would cut him up IF he reached his destination . That's one of the things that got me , but really , the whole sake of the film lies on what Douglas will do . What if Douglas shot himself early on ? What if the shock of thinking he killed his brother gave him a heart attack ? What if he didn't get out of the underwater taxi and drowned ? What if ? If I were The Game , I wouldn't bet that much on a suicidal man .
430414	1173088	102926	7.0	Inferior to " Se7en " but a good movie - just overrated !	Hannibal . The very name sparks fear , discomfort , and ultimately recognition . He is one of the most popular screen characters of all time , the incarnation of evil , and yet strangely likable despite his distasteful savoring of human flesh . " I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice bottle of chianti , " he tells FBI Agent Clarice Starling ( Jodie Foster ) after she meets him in a prison , metal bars their only means of separation . Their first conversation and face-to-face interaction is a vital element of the film's narrative ; the bars represent Starling's own self-defense ; they have wide-open spaces that are easily penetrable . And Hannibal Lecter , a psychologist and cannibal , knows exactly how to reach past her own mental cell bars and crack into her brain , and he does so in the classic scene where she recalls memories from her childhood , of the lamb she tried to save . . . Agent Starling is on the case of a bizarre serial killer whose victims tend to be young women . Although they are unaware of his motives , it turns out the infamous " Buffalo Bill " is using the skin of these unfortunate victims for his own sick pleasure . He's not the sort of person you'd feel comfortable being stuck next to in an otherwise empty elevator . Clarice is smart , a feminine icon of the movies . Her brains are what propel her own investigation into the case while her desire to unearth the truth and succeed past the results of her male counterparts stems from a sort of egotistical dominance . Not many people comment upon Sterling's own sexuality , her almost overly excessive efforts at saving the victims ( who happen to be females ) . Buffalo Bill seems to represent her own image of men : cruel creatures who inflict pain and suffering upon helpless women . Her sole friend , the only man she can rely on for help and inside tidbits , is an outcast upon society - - a metaphor for the repressed homosexuals who are abandoned by their own societies , shunned by those who feel they are not " normal . " Harris's underlying implications of homosexuality and female dominance in the novel are admittedly stronger than in the film , although the presence of the suggestions is clearly evident under close examination . Or , it could just be about serial killers and FBI agents . You decide . Sure , the movie is famous , but we must ask ourselves whether or not the film's reputation has given it a better face over the year than it has deserved . It is well directed , but never does the film fascinate us as the bold and daring " Se7en " did . " Silence of the Lambs " is a fine film , but pales in comparison to some of its imitators and fellow genre occupants . The acting and writing is not at fault . Hopkins and Foster are superb . Hopkins received the most critical acclaim , although in 2001 we all realized that Foster was a key to the series as well , when she was unsuccessfully replaced with Julianne Moore in the sequel , " Hannibal , " directed by Ridley Scott , which was a total failure and disappointment for the fans of the original and source material , the novels by Thomas Harris , who has reportedly never seen " Silence of the Lambs " for fear that it would influence his writing . " Lambs , " more than any other film in the series , is terribly manipulative , complete with tacky flashbacks that are out of place and all too convenient . That's where the film ultimately fails . The direction by Jonathan Demme is , truth be told , rather poor and borderline mediocre ; Demme does not use cinematography to his advantage , does not use darker tones to evoke feelings from the prints as Fincher did with " Se7en . " It's a great movie with convincing performances and a realistic script packaged in the form of a typical Hollywood thriller - - it might have a good reputation , it might be a good movie , but compared to other classics of the genre , " The Silence of the Lambs " just doesn't hold up as much as I had hoped it would after all these years . It's revolutionary , but isn't the masterpiece it used to be . On the plus side there's always that terrific ending to look forward to .
430565	1173088	106977	7.0	Run Harrison Run .	Imagine a time , if you will , when fugitive movies were not released ten times a year , a time when Tommy Lee Jones actually appeared in fugitive movies simply because he liked the script and not because he was revisiting the role that made him famous again , a time when the fugitive movies were about much more than simply a homicidal maniac being chased by a man who has a connection to him . You will understand this film a lot more . It relies so much on characters and a witty script as compared to explosions and fight scenes . But of course that's not to say it doesn't have any pyrotechnics or chase scenes or battles - the action scenes will satisfy even the biggest of action buffs . It just makes a lot more sense when they're there for a purpose . Harrison Ford plays Dr . Ryan Kimble . Kimble comes home from work one night after an emergency procedure at the hospital to find his wife brutally beaten to death by a one-armed man . The one-armed man escapes from the scene of the crime and all evidence points to Ryan as the assaultant and killer . After sentenced to death , Ryan is pushed into the back of a convict bus transporting convicted fellons to jail . But one of the criminals tries to escape and the bus ends up swerving off the road and flipping down a steep ravine , coming to rest upon a railroad track . Ryan escapes before the train rips through the bus , resulting in a great scene where Ryan is running in front of the derailed train , chained at his feet and arms . It's the classic Indiana Jones bolder scene redux . Ryan eventually disappears into the woods and U . S . Marshal Samuel Gerard ( Tommy Lee Jones ) arrives at the scene of the crash a short time later . He is the ultimate seeker ; he is barely ever wrong about anything , and when he is he doesn't like to admit it . Jones presents his character with such a sense of self-confidence and oozing calmness that his Oscar was well-deserved . Ryan keeps on running throughout the film , only stopping to gather evidence of his killer and then moving on . He goes through some interesting scenarios and starts to stumble upon a conspiracy , but no one will hear his story - the only living person who might care is the same man who says he doesn't care : Sam Gerard . If I am correct in my observations , Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones only appear in about two scenes together - the rest of the film they are apart from each other . As Jones pursues Ford , it seems as though he starts to make a connection with his prey - as though he may be the only one understanding what Ford is doing and why . It creates a sense of greater suspense for the audience . This is not a run-of-the-mill chase picture we are exploited to on so many occasions . We care for both characters in equal regards , and when they finally do come face-to-face it results in a kind of unexpected payoff ; at last we get to see the two together in the same shot and it's strangeThe movie is directed by Andrew Davis , who directed " Collateral Damage " and " Holes . " He has a solid sense of direction even if the material itself doesn't always hold together . Given a terrific script like " The Fugitive , " Davis creates a type of cement cornerstone that is the base of the film . The script and direction compliment themselves often , something that can't be said in most cases . Tommy Lee Jones recently appeared in " The Hunted , " a film about a madman killer on the loose , and Jones plays the man trying to pursue him . The stupidity of the script hit me hard . I rewatched " The Fugitive " not a week after I saw " The Hunted " and realized the sheer genius of it versus the lesser film . This is a movie that will wet the apetite of all action , mystery and thriller lovers alike who are looking for something different than the routine chase films . I know it did for me . stars - John Ulmer

Sometimes you've just got to sit back , relax , and enjoy the ride . I did	' S1m0ne''S1m0ne ' is based around a failing Hollywood director , who creates a digital star ; the star , named ' Simone , ' ( Simulation One ) becomes an overnight sensation . She is admired by women and wanted by men . She is everywhere . She wins Oscars , awards of all kinds . There's only one problem . The more attention the director's creation gets , the harder it is for him to keep the secret buried . Viktor Taransky is that director , played by the wonderful Al Pacino . All of Viktor's latest films have been ' tanks , ' as his ex-wife ( ( Catherine Keener ) admirably calls them , at the box office . But hope is in sight yet for Viktor . Or was , before his biggest star ( Ryder ) walks out on him , leaving him to cope with no star , and an upcoming dropped contract with the studio ( courtesy to his ex ) . And then , on the verge of madness and frustration , Hank Aleno ( Elias Koteas ) , a mad scientist with an eye tumor , hands something magical and mysterious to Viktor . A box . But what is inside the box is what is so magical , as Viktor soon finds out . He just doesn't realize how special it is . He now has the power to create an actress . But not just any actress-an actress who never forgets her lines , never makes any mistakes for the press to create a stir about , and never , ever talks back . And so that is what starts this cynical comedy off . Written , produced and directed by Andrew Niccol , who recently brought us the Jim Carrey vehicle " The Truman Show " and wrote and directed " Gattaca , " both movies satirizing Hollywood and its potential outcomes . However , I enjoyed ' S1m0ne ' more than ' The Truman Show . ' There was just something about Truman that I couldn't warm up to ? it left me in the cold , wishing I could come in ; but the film just wouldn't let me . There was a feeling of distance from the audience . Much is the same with ' Simone , ' however : I feel that ' Simone ' has a much better sense of humor . Yes , many of the things are routine . Yes , there are plot holes galore . But that was part of the problem I had with Truman ? the plot holes . There were too many . ' Simone , ' however , has little enough plot holes as to not ruin the film , and just enough to not give it a tremendous rating . Al Pacino does good here . He's very believable as Taransky . So is Rachel Roberts as Simone . She has that level of ' Hollywoodosity ' that makes stars famous . I think that ' Simone ' did deliver on many levels . Yes , leaving the audience guessing isn't its strongest trait , but I still enjoyed it . Sometimes you've just got to sit back , relax , and enjoy the ride . I did , at least . stars ? John Ulmer
430977	1173088	97368	7.0	I Enjoyed it - a Good B Horror Movie Reminiscent of Those From the Fifties . . . Perfect for a Friday Night !	" The Fly II " As I write this review , I have never seen the remake of " The Fly " with Ian Malcolm - err , Jeff Goldblum - and Geena Davis . So I really have no basis to compare this sequel to . Therefore , I will continue with this review in light that I have not seen the original remake . . . The film opens with a Geena Davis Lookalike giving birth to a son ; she dies , the baby lives . Baby grows older , and because he is fly , he grows at a rapid rate , for some reason . I'm not sure why this would make him bigger instead of smaller , but oh well . His name is Martin , and he turns into Eric Stoltz when he is five . Yes , you read that right . Five . Martin is looked over by the head of a company , where he is kept and given medication to keep him from turning into a fly . . . But soon young Martin finds out that not everything is what it seems , and he begins to mutate into . . . THE LIZARD . Well , that's what he looks like , anyway . As I watched this , I kept a careful eye on Eric Stoltz . Why ? Well , as I'm sure everyone knows by now , he was originally cast for Marty McFly for " Back to the Future , " and they filmed much of the movie with him before Bob Zemeckis dropped him for Fox . In fact , there is still a scene where he is diving into the Delorean that is intact . Freeze frame the film and you can see it's not Fox . I always thought that footage looked odd - like it wasn't Fox doing the stunt . . . Anyway , I watched Stoltz and realized how bad he would have been as Marty McFly . He just isn't hyper enough - Michael J . Fox was perfect for Marty , Stoltz would have ruined it . He's not a bad actor , mind you . He's perfect for this role ( well at least " good " for this role ) , but for Marty ? Nah . . . On a side note , I'm not sure if this is a coincidence or bizarre in-joke , but Stoltz's character plays a kid named Martin . . . similar to Fox's character Marty McFly . . . Martin . . . Marty . . . . And , I thought of something else that I haven't seen someone point out before . Marty's last name in " BttF " is McFly . What does Martin turn into in this film ? A FLY ! Martin the Fly , Marty McFly . . . taking a quote from " Uncle Buck " : " Is there a little similarity here ? Ooh , I think there is ! " The film was directed by the creature effects artist of the original - and sequel : Chris Walas . You might recognize his name , because he wrote " Gremlins 2 " and did the creature effects for " Gremlins , " as well . Anyway , he directs the film pretty good for a creature effects artist . . . I guess . . . What I like so much about this movie is its high campy quality . It is a hybrid of B horror movies from the fifties and sixties and the " new breed " of horror films in the eighties , that were like B horror movies with gore . Lots of gore . I guess it doesn't qualify as strictly campy , because the old horror movies were not so disgusting . . . so I just call these films the eighties B horror movies . Simple enough , eh ? I have always been a sucker for the campy horrors from the eighties , especially when they are sequels that tread into old territory . For example , in one scene we see footage of Jeff Goldblum being interviewed . Martin watches this with interest . And what I think is so interesting is that we can look back and say , " Oh , yes , that was before Goldblum knew he was turning into a fly . " It's just interesting to do that . It seems like many films from the eighties would have archive footage from the original film . Anyway , " The Fly II " is a lot like these films . It gives us a glance back at the original . I'm not sure if I can explain in words what this does . It just provides a feeling for me - kind of like campy horrors make some people feel good . I like when horror movies - - or any movies , for that matter - - travel into the film before . . . we can look at the old characters and say , " Oh , yes , that was before this was going to happen . . . " It's just fun to do . I can't describe it in words . This movie , like many horror sequels from the eighties , is just enjoyable . Odd , but enjoyable . It's hard not to have fun watching it . If you take it seriously you're going to have a pretty hard time watching , but if you turn off the brain for two hours you'll have some fun . My only two complaints is that this movie is about a half hour too long , and the creature looks like a lizard and not a fly . Other than that , it is a fun ride . Not great , but a good , well done horror movie that never takes itself too seriously . Perfect for a Friday night . stars - John Ulmer
430284	1173088	277027	7.0	A great performance by Sean Penn in a good movie	" I Am Sam " is a film with a main performance stronger than the movie itself . Sean Penn was Oscar-nominated for his role as Sam , a mentally retarded father who hires a savvy lawyer ( Michelle Pfeiffer ) to represent him in a custody trial involving his daughter ( Dakota Fanning ) . The courts think Sam isn't fit to be a father due to his mental limitations , but Sam feels otherwise . As Pfeiffer begins representing Sam she realizes he is a good father and feels an emotional attachment to the case that she hasn't experienced when dealing with criminals and the sort . This film came out and received generally negative reviews in 2001 , which I was surprised at considering it's an enjoyable movie . The performances are admittedly much stronger than the actual film ( which has kind of been done in the past ) - Penn deserved his Oscar nom and Pfeiffer is strong and perfect for the role of a lawyer . If you're a fan of the actors you should watch this , but if you don't like Penn or Pfeiffer you should be more reluctant since it's basically a performance film .
429558	1173088	76059	7.0	A fun , enjoyable family movie albeit far from perfect .	" Fun with Dick and Jane " is a solid , well-made family movie , although it goes without saying that it's not perfect . Dick ( George Segal ) is a successful upper-class businessman who suddenly loses his job when his boss ( Ed McMahon ) fires him . His wife , Jane ( Jane Fonda ) , soon finds her world turned upside-down as she is hard-pressed to afford the most simple commodities . In a last-ditch effort , the couple turn to harmless crime such as robbing banks ( never killing people - it is a PG movie after all and they aren't Bonnie and Clyde , as the tagline says ) , until they decide to even rip off Dick's ex-boss at one of his Christmas parties . The movie is being remade this year with Jim Carrey ( originally to co-star Cameron Diaz , who pulled out ) and I don't think it's necessary . The original works as an amiable , entertaining family comedy and a remake set today would only seem redundant . The cast is strong - McMahon is a scene-stealer and Fonda and Segal have good chemistry . It's a lite version of " Bonnie and Clyde " with a predictably fairy-tale-happy ending and likable characters . It's not ugly or mean-spirited , it's just a nice family film - and what more would you expect from a movie called " Fun with Dick and Jane " ? ( Well , other than porn , obviously . )
430055	1173088	104694	7.0	An interesting and entertaining study of women's baseball	I've seen this numerous times on cable over the years . While it isn't a perfect film , it is a nice little enjoyable flick for a Sunday afternoon - you could do worse . When the men were shipped off to fight in World War II , there wasn't anyone left to play baseball . Fearing financial losses , women were hired to fill in for the men's absence - forming major and minor league teams and putting on games like the boys did . This is based on a true story and stars Geena Davis as the main character . Tom Hanks plays her alcoholic coach , who has trouble accepting his position as a women's coach - he kind of resents the idea of coaching females in general . Madonna has a co-star role as one of the baseball players , and it was her name on the credits that really helped make this a success back in ' 92 - without her it wouldn't have been quite as marketable . The cast is overall pretty good . There are some recognizable faces like Jon Lovitz to add humor to the mix . And the story is well told without coming across as smug . It's not a great movie but if you're in the mood for gentle entertainment , it's a good choice .
430005	1173088	414881	7.0	An insightful documentary	This documentary - filmed exclusively for the 2004 DVD release of " Bubba Ho-tep " ( which , incidentally , is still available to purchase a year after its initial release despite having been a " limited edition " ) is an insightful look into the making of the cult hit . The documentary's best parts are when it exposes the truth behind decisions , such as when star Bruce Campbell contacted director Don Coscarelli because of his concern about the penis gags in the script - he wanted to make sure nothing would be shown in detail . Director Coscarelli tells of how he originally stumbled upon the short story in a collection by one of his favorite authors , and how he immediately thought it would be a great movie . The making-of included on the DVD isn't great , but - like the movie - is entertaining and different . If you rent or buy the disc , make sure to watch this along with the " King " commentary on the film itself , which is very funny .
429596	1173088	99615	7.0	Ferris Bueller meets The Godfather !	A nice self-referential comedy about a first-year film student in New York City who gets involved with an " importer " ( Marlon Brando ) who turns out to be a Mafia kingpin . This is probably the only opportunity you will ever get to see Marlon Brando ( whose ego is as large as his stomach ) poke fun at his own image , which was created back in 1972 with " The Godfather . " Here Brando essentially plays Don Vito Corlone , and everyone knows it , and it works . Sometimes it's like watching a comedy sequel to the trilogy . My only wish ? That Robert De Niro had appeared in a small cameo . ( Trivia note : De Niro and Brando are the only two actors to ever achieve Oscars for playing the same characters . ) Also , Bruno Kirby is in this . Bruno Kirby was in " The Godfather Part II , " which starred Robert De Niro as Vito Corlone , who Brando played in the original . Talk about coincidental links . stars . - John Ulmer
429828	1173088	80139	8.0	Very underrated	" Winter Kills " is based on a novel by Richard Condon ( " The Manchurian Candidate " ) about a man who confesses to having killed the President on his death bed . The President's brother ( Jeff Bridges ) witnesses the confession and stumbles upon a conspiracy plot involving more murder and silencing . This movie somehow slipped under the radar years ago . Whereas " Manchurian Candidate " got the attention it rightfully deserved , " Winter Kills " was killed by its controversy and production faults . It was allegedly filmed in 1975 and only released in 1979 , although I can't find any evidence to back this up . What I do know is that it was given an X rating in the UK , and when a movie in the UK gets an X rating , you know something's wrong . I'm not sure why it received such a harsh rating but evidently that had something to do with its box office failure . I suppose its themes ( clear allusion to the JFK assassination ) were too heavy - not to mention the violence was rather explicit . Seen today , this movie is an underrated gem . John Huston delivers a great performance as Bridges ' father , while Bridges is equally great . The music in the film is eerie and tense - without it , I doubt the film would be quite as good as it is . It was directed by William Richert ( who played the gay Bob Pigeon in " My Own Private Idaho " ) and he does a fine job . The movie builds its suspense well ; the only segment I didn't like too much was when Bridges goes to visit his father for the first time . I felt it went on too long and was out of place . Other than that , this is a very good film and a sadly underrated conspiracy theory movie that never got its chance to make a mark .
429561	1173088	80120	8.0	" Warriors . . . WARRIORS ! Come out and play-ee-AYYY ! " A really fun , cheesy suspense flick	" The Warriors " is a film that takes place in New York City during the hellish hours after dark , when the gangs emerge to roam the streets and search for their prey . One of these gangs , named The Warriors , agree to attend a gang meeting orchestrated by the enigmatic Cyrus ( Roger Hill ) . Each gang sends nine unarmed delegates to attend the huge meeting ; however , Cyrus is murdered by a thug , who blames the crime on the Warriors . They flee for their lives into the night , and soon every gang in New York City is looking for them . First things first : this movie is cheesy . The beginning is pretty laughable . The musical score is very much late ' 70s / early ' 80s electronica . But that is part of the movie's charm . Its polished big budget remake is coming out next year ( 2006 ) , and I personally feel it will fail because part of the success of this original film is that it IS low budget , poorly edited at times and simply a lot of fun to watch . It is very reminiscent of John Carpenter's 1976 low budget classic " Assault on Precinct 13 . " It achieves its thrills through heavy suspense ; as the Warriors prowl the streets heading back to their home turf we never know when a rival gang will appear out of nowhere and attack . The movie is now a video game by Rockstar Entertainment , and it's one of the few movies for which a video game actually seems to make sense - it feels very much like a level progression where bad guys attack the good guys , who have to use their brawn and brains to overcome them . Is " The Warriors " a great film ? No . From a technical standpoint , it's terrible . In terms of entertainment , it is extremely gripping . I was really enthralled . In recent years , Walter Hill has provided us with some really awful films , but " The Warriors " is a strong reminder that he once had a solid vision . . . it's too bad he's lost that now .
430914	1173088	390521	8.0	Not an indictment of McDonald's but rather a general warning to America : we aren't getting any smaller	In 2002 I was overweight and eating way too much . For about a year , due to location and time issues , I thrived on a diet of Burger King , McDonald's , and Pizza Hut . I used to be able to eat an entire pizza . Sometimes I'd eat a Tombstone for lunch , then another for dinner ; or maybe get a King Size Burger King meal and eat the entire thing in one sitting . The regular size pizzas weren't enough for me - eventually I had to get the New Yorker at Pizza Hut because it was bigger than all the others . No , I wasn't the only person in the family , so others ate it , as well . But I ate most of it . And after a year on this diet I was about 180 and out of shape . I found myself aggravated with the way I looked , felt , ate , and reacted to standard physical issues . I even began to develop back problems . It starts as any other addiction - alcohol , drugs or tobacco . It triggers our brains . Next time you're hungry , look at a picture of a McDonald's burger on a TV commercial and see what your stomach does to you . Then go look in your fridge at a piece of celery . Quite a difference , huh ? I wasn't severely obese and in fact I'm kind of big and bulky by nature so a lot of the weight was just due to my general size . But I knew I had to lose the extra weight so one day I just said , " To hell with it . " I quit eating pizza , I started working out and lifting weights . I took up running and other physical activities and watched my diet - high protein , low fat and calories . A lot of lean meats and natural vegetables and fruit . Eventually I lost all the excess weight . I'm now about 130 and gained around 20 pounds of muscle so I lost about 70 - 75 pounds from December 03 to December 04 . I watched " Super Size Me " with all this in mind . I had been through all this . I could relate . And I knew precisely what filmmaker Morgan Spurlock was trying to say - many people misunderstand the film . I've heard friends and reviewers say , " Of course you're going to gain weight if you eat at McDonald's every day , no one does THAT ! " Well , first of all , that's not Morgan's point . Its message isn't , " Blame it on the food companies ! " " Super Size Me " promotes a message to viewers : it is equally our fault . Yes , we're bombarded with ads , hidden facts and misleading marketing . McDonald's in particular has such a firm grasp on America as a whole that it's rather frightening . But Morgan's point is that we can't blame America's obesity solely on the fast food companies - it starts with us . We need to start cutting back on fast food . Morgan presents facts from doctors and uses himself as proof - too much can seriously harm your health , and only two of one hundred doctors in the film recommended you should eat at McDonald's ( or any fast food chain ) more than a few times a _ year _ . That means for the people on the go who stop by McDonald's or Burger King or Pizza Hut or Wendy's for a quick bite are risking a lot . They're paying out of pocket for non-nutritive , fatty , calorie-loaded , heart-clogging food . Morgan isn't saying with " Super Size Me " that we should all go out and sue the burger companies . He isn't saying we should " never " eat fast food . He's saying we're becoming too closely associated with the franchises ; twenty , thirty years ago it was a treat , a luxury ; now it's hard to imagine a child under the age of 5 not knowing who Ronald McDonald is . And that's kind of scary .
430370	1173088	113198	8.0	One of the better Disney films of the past decade , with a good moral message	Goofy ( whose voice is provided by veteran Bill Farmer ) has a son , Max , who is a teenager in high school . Max is a loser and is tired of not getting any attention , so one day Max hijacks a school auditorium announcement being made by the principal and lip-synches a popular song with the help of his friend ( voice by Pauly Shore ) . This earns him brief popularity before he is threatened with possibly being expelled from the school . Goofy overreacts and thinks his son is on a slippery slope to becoming a criminal , so he decides to spend some father-son time with Max by going on a cross-country road trip . Along the way Goofy struggles with his son as their relationship is put to its test . One thing I've always enjoyed about this film is that - apart from its surprisingly good animation - it has a really strong story behind it . " A Goofy Movie " could easily have just become what its title sounds like - some lame excuse to see Goofy run around for 90 minutes like a maniac - but the whole story between Goofy and Max comes across as being oddly realistic for a cartoon . For a Disney film this is also surprisingly mature - it takes place through the perspective of a high-schooler , Goofy and Max get into plenty of arguments and there's a romantic interest for Max . The entire film has a good message behind it and could easily be translated to a live-action , non-Disney film and still work . The musical sequences are fun and lively , the story is exceptional for a film of this genre and the animation is above average . Perhaps not the most kid-friendly animated film , or something most Goofy enthusiasts would want to acknowledge , but for those with an open mind this is a bizarre production .
429305	1173088	92005	8.0	" The Goonies " for adults .	Based on the Stephen King novel " The Body , " " Stand By Me " is a good ( albeit overrated ) film about friendship . It's really made all the more touching due to the passing of River Phoenix in the early ' 90s , which ties in to the plot in a number of eerie ways . The film is strong in terms of acting , writing and even directing ( by Rob Reiner ) - unfortunately its flaws are that it's sometimes a bit too emotionally controlling and constrictive , laying on the cheese a bit heavy . But it is a fine film , worth watching now and again , " The Goonies " for adults . On another note , I just purchased the new Deluxe Edition DVD , which is really just the old Special Edition DVD re-packaged with a CD soundtrack . The " Deluxe " DVD itself was a disappointment as it even had glaring grammatical errors on the back cover . I felt a bit ripped off .
430450	1173088	479143	8.0	" Balboa " is a knockout - Stallone's best film in thirty years	When Sylvester Stallone announced that he wanted to make another " Rocky " film , we were still in the 1990s . No studios would finance the project after the critical and commercial failure of John G . Avildsen's " Rocky V . " For years , it seemed the prospect of another Rocky movie was impossible ( and laughable ) . Stallone's star continued to fade , but in 2005 , MGM underwent a management shift , and Sony stepped in and agreed to greenlight Stallone's sixth Rocky film ? for a fraction of the costs of the previous sequels , to be filmed low-key and without much of a marketing campaign per se . And here we finally have it : the final Rocky movie . And while it's easy to laugh at the idea of watching a 59-year-old Rocky enter the ring again , don't chuckle yet ? the long hiatus gave Stallone time to work diligently on his screenplay , pushing it through multiple re-writes , fixing problems . This is a grungy , down-to-earth Rocky ? the real Rocky ? and not the over-the-top caricature present in the last two films . The Reagan era theatrics are gone ? this is a bleak return to the original character , and the earlier sequels are almost entirely ignored ( for good reason ) . There are a few problems . As always , Stallone uses a lot of clichés in his film ? the " nice guy " routine worked a bit better in the original movie . ( Which isn't to say it doesn't work in " Balboa " ? but it feels a bit corny in today's age . ) Stallone also has a tendency to drag in poorly developed subplots ? the motivation behind the inclusion of a storyline featuring " Lil ' Marie " ( the girl he walked home in the original movie ) and her son , Steps , is admirable ; however , it could have been developed further . Similarly , Rocky's relationship with his son in the movie is predictable from the start : it's pure formula . If Stallone had just tweaked these problems a bit , he would have had a complete masterpiece on his hands ? easily one of the best films of the year . But as it stands , " Rocky Balboa " ? in spite of its flaws ? is still a rewarding achievement ; a refreshing return to form for the series and a poignant farewell to the character . After the abysmal " Rocky V , " Stallone has returned to his roots and delivered an appropriate goodbye to his most recognizable character . Stallone , in his best performance since " Cop Land , " is a beaten man . Rocky's love Adrian has died from cancer , and he runs a humble restaurant in South Philly where he is an unassuming host . Things chance when the current Heavyweight Champion of the World is pitted against Rocky in a virtual reality boxing match on ESPN ; the result ( Rocky wins ) ignites interest in boxing promoters , who convince Rocky to appear in an " exhibition " boxing match to reflect the virtual match . Stallone knows how to pace the movie ? the first hour is all character study . The training sequences we have come to know from earlier sequels ( which have become classically and humorously dated by today's standards ) are absent ; the modernized training segment is only a minute and a half long , and although it features Bill Conti's iconic " Gonna Fly Now " theme , it is noticeably less flashy and over-the-top than the previous movies ' training montages ; Rocky's trainer explains that by now he already knows the how's and why's of training , and Stallone's decision to shorten the training montage reflects this . The final boxing match is perhaps the first Rocky battle in three decades in which we are unsure of the outcome ; there was little doubt in our minds that Rocky would beat Mr . T in the third film , but here , we're not really too sure what's going to happen . Will he win ? Will he lose ? Will he live ? Will he die ? It's a testament to the strength of the movie that audiences are left in doubt until the very end . " Rocky Balboa " is not just good entertainment ? it's a solid film with an uplifting message . The original film had a moral , which became increasingly murky in later entries ; " Balboa " sets the series back on track . It's an inspiring story that reflects Stallone's own struggles over the past decade to get this thing off the ground . His passion shows ? this is his most personal project in thirty years and it also reveals just how entwined Stallone and his Rocky alter ego have become over the years . You can easily confuse the two here ? it's kind of a bittersweet finale after such a long journey over the years . " Rocky " fans are going to enjoy this ; regular filmgoers are going to walk away feeling pleasantly surprised , inspired and uplifted by a movie with a fairly obvious but nevertheless empowering moral at its center . Stallone has finally ? after years of trying ? brought back the character we fell in love with in 1976 , and seeing the real Rocky one last time was worth the wait .
430814	1173088	181288	8.0	Brilliant .	If you have ever wanted to make a film , you should watch this documentary about an auspicious filmmaker named Mark who dreams of making an epic about his own life , aptly titled " Northwestern . " Mark is shown writing his script , casting the film , trying to promote it and gain money to finance it . . . halfway through the documentary he scraps it after he is unable to gain enough funds . He then finishes up an older film of his , " Coven , " which he had scrapped two years before . " Coven " really exists ( http imdb com title tt0225434 ) and so does Mark Borchardt . When I first saw this , I knew it had to be a mockumentary . It is not . I'm sure some scenes were staged , acted or re-shot , but it seems not many . I've heard and read from various sources that the majority of this film is realistic and factual . Which is actually rather sad , and scary . This movie will move you if you've ever wanted to direct a film . It is also an invaluable insight into the production of a film and just how hard it is to get one made . Not every wannabe turns into Quentin Tarantino , and " American Movie : The Making of Northwestern " exposes this sad fact very clearly .
430517	1173088	117500	8.0	A Solid , Action-Packed Thrill Ride !	' The Rock'The film that solidified Nicolas Cage as an action star and Sean Connery as ? well ? a guy who uses the F-word a lot , ' The Rock ' never ceases to slow on the action ; its plot is , of course , ridiculous , but I'm not looking for an Oscar winner in an action movie . Cage plays Stanley Goodspeed ( weird name number 1 ) , a chemical specialist whom disarms chemical bombs and such . Ed Harris plays Himmel or Hummel or something like that ( weird name number 2 ) , a respected General who one day decides , ' What the heck ! ' and takes Alcatraz prison hostage ; he demands respect for dead marines from the government , or he will release some ba-a-a-ad gas on San Francisco . Enter Cage , who must , with a pack of government marines , enter Alcatraz from underneath ( under water ) and take out Himmel / Hummel . That's where Sean Connery comes in as John Mason , the only man to ever escape Alcatraz unscathed . Connery ' agrees ' to help them enter the prison the same way he escaped . ' The Rock ' is pure , unadulterated fun . Nothing less , nothing more . It delivers everything you want in an action film : Explosions , guns , special effects , and more explosions . If you can't have fun watching a movie like this , you can't have fun watching a movie . Period . The acting in ' The Rock ' is nothing to scoff at . Nicolas Cage is great in this role , as in other action roles . The thing that is different here , however , is that Nic doesn't know how to use weapons much ; he is a chemical expert , not a trained FBI agent . So , it is more than humorous to see him running around defenseless ; especially seeing that it is Nicolas Cage , who usually plays action roles where he is the master of the weapons . Sean Connery is perfect for the role of John Mason ; he blends wisecracks , action and ? well ? Sean Connery . Ed Harris is also very good as Himmelhummelwhatever ; he seems a bit held back at times , but overall , his acting is as good as ever . The direction style in ' The Rock ' reminds me very much of other Nicolas Cage films , like John Woo's ' Face / Off ' and such . It is gritty , dark , and exciting . It adapts to the characters ' emotions . The first thirty minutes or so of ' The Rock ' are nothing special ; I almost stopped watching at one point . But once they get to Alcatraz the action picks up and never slows down . Explosion after explosions after gunfight after stunts , leading to an explosive ending ( literally ) that may be predictable to a certain degree , but nevertheless lotsa ' fun . All in all , ' The Rock ' is the kind of movie where you sit back , turn off your brain for two hours , and have some slam-bam fun . stars ? John Ulmer
429930	1173088	82085	8.0	Solid conspiracy thriller with a great twist at the end	" Blow Out " is a loose remake of " Blow-Up " ( 1966 ) that alludes to many factual conspiracy theories and political cover-ups / events ranging from presidential assassination to the JFK Chappaquiddick accident . It uses elements from " Blow-Up " but , in my opinion , improves upon them and isn't as cheesy and dated as the 1966 film . It stars John Travolta as Jack , a sound effects expert who works on low-grade porn films for a living , unable to achieve anything greater . One night while out recording sounds to be used for later projects , he inadvertently captures the sound of a crashing car , personally witnessing it dive into a nearby lake of water . He jumps into the lake , rescues a girl ( Nancy Allen ) from within the car , and becomes a hero for about five minutes , until some suspicious men approach him at the hospital and ask him not to tell anyone what happened . Feeling uneasy about what's going on , Jack investigates into the accident and realizes that the driver of the car was a presidential nominee , and the girl was his mistress . Jack plays back his audio tape of the accident and hears something strange in the background - - a gunshot . Finally understanding that something big is going on , Jack teams up with the mistress and attempts to unveil the conspiracy surrounding the event - - whilst being pursued by a strange and mysterious hit-man ( played eerily well by Jon Lithgow ) . " Blow Out " is one of Quentin Tarantino's top three favorite films of all time , and like many film buffs , that was one of the only reasons I even was aware of its existence . I picked it up on DVD at a relatively cheap price , expecting a clever thriller with a ( hopefully ) satisfying conclusion . I would not say that " Blow Out " is one of the greatest movies ever made , but it is one of Brian De Palma's best films and a very good suspense thriller . It features one of John Travolta's best performances with some really great references to popular conspiracy theories , placed in a more easily accessible and realistic setting . As a result the story seems entirely convincing and scary ; De Palma is often accused of copying Hitchcock , and although there are definite homages to the Master of Suspense in " Blow Out , " De Palma also implements enough of his own tricks into the film to establish himself as one of the best directors of the time . ( What a shame that he had to go downhill from here . ) The final twist at the end of the movie is totally unexpected . It's not your typical thriller conclusion where there's a big surprise - - instead the fate of the characters themselves is the surprise and for that reason alone I would say " Blow Out " is far more unique than many other films in its genre . Recommended .
430162	1173088	120483	9.0	You have to experience it . . .	Great spy-spoof of Hitchcock's classic 1930s film ( remade in the 50s ) in title only involving an American tourist ( Bill Murray ) getting put in a fake spy program by his frustrated brother ( Peter Gallagher ) , who only wants peace and quiet . The catch : He gets caught up in a real spy scandal , mistaken for a top secret American operative working undercover in Britain . Having lived in London for most of my life , moving back and forth twice from England to America , this movie is a fun culture clash comedy that uses one of comedy's dryest , funniest personalities to its advantage . Lots of fun , slightly ruined by a madcap ending that , in retrospect , actually seems quite pleasant and enjoyable . stars . - John Ulmer
430028	1173088	38975	9.0	A beautiful film	" The Spiral Staircase " starts off with an afflicted woman being murdered , and right from the onset I was surprised at how explicit it was for its time - by today's standards it's nothing you don't see every day on television , but 1946 was a very different time . It then moves onwards and we are introduced to a young woman who is mute and lives in a mansion with a long , spiraling staircase . ( Hint : this pays off later in the movie . ) When it's made known that a killer is making his rounds murdering afflicted women , the owner of the mansion fears for the mute woman's life - and after a string of more murders occur they realize she's next . RKO's picture was far ahead of its time . Someone on here said it's not a film noir and commanded that people stop calling it one . I'll disagree . I think it IS film noir , in the sense that it's a personal struggle for one person who's surrounded by death and murder . I don't think it should be left up to one person to decide what " film noir " really means . I do think there are limits of course ( " Batman Returns " is NOT film noir , it just tries to come across as one ) but no one should say , " This isn't a film noir because it's a thriller . " So what ? Loads of film noirs are thrillers . I personally feel the stylings , the themes and the motif of the movie could be classified as " film noir . " It's a beautiful movie to look at , very well filmed , and the ending is probably one of the best I can remember ever seeing . It's had a few remakes over the years , but the first remains the best - by a long shot . Highly recommended .
429544	1173088	77928	9.0	A harrowing and powerful film	Loosely based on the true story of Billy Hayes ( collected from his book of the same title ) , Alan Parker's " Midnight Express " contains some of the most effective and rightly iconic scenes in all of film history - - the opening with the heartbeats devoid of any soundtrack ; the " Oh Billy ! " segment ; and of course the entire idea of Turkish prisons being terrible and abusive . Hayes ' story was elaborative to begin with and Oliver Stone - - not exactly one to be known for sticking close to the truth - - exaggerates it even more ; so far , indeed , that it almost becomes fictional . The real Hayes had no girlfriend , was not raped in jail , DID have a homosexual relationship with another inmate ( the film shows him denying the advances ) , and escaped at night by sea . However , as a film this is probably one of the great motion pictures of the 1970s . Parker ( " Angel Heart " ) is a brilliant visual director and uses much of the same imagery he would use later on in his career . For example , take note of the fans in the sweltering heat inside the courtroom . They'd be used again in " Angel Heart . " Brad Davis gives a wonderful performance and convincingly devolves from a naive American student to a crazy lunatic by the time he enters the insane asylum . John Hurt's performance was also worthy of its Oscar nomination . Overall , this is very much a product of its time - - it's depressing , bleak , and almost painful to watch ; and because it's a Stone screenplay , there's a lot of politics at play . However , the overall film is breathtaking , thrilling and unpredictable ( to a point ) - - it's definitely worth seeing at least once in your lifetime .

If not , I don't know where you're coming from . Some of the most famous acting talents came together to form THE PRINCESS BRIDE , and 1 great director . Rob Reiner directs this all-star cast , in you not-so-average fairytale adventure . Filled with swashbuckling sword fights , tremendous thrills , incredible romance , excellent actors and cameos , a very original comedic look at fairytales , and so much more , THE PRINCESS BRIDE is the SHREK of the eighties .

429545	1173088	53198	9.0	Truffaut's autobiographical masterpiece	As Fellini's " 8 " was a reflection of his own torment as a director , " The 400 Blows " was Francois Truffaut's exorcism of personal demons . Antoine Doinel is allegedly Truffaut's own projection of himself at an early age , and this movie was a very important project for the director as an adult . Jean-Pierre Léaud plays Antoine remarkably well , as a thoughtful but rebellious Parisian student who skips school and goes to the movies with his friends . His mother ( Claire Maurier ) shows no interest in the boy , nor does his father . He retreats home every day sullenly and sits on his bed , daydreaming . Beautifully filmed and still poignant after all these years , Truffaut's masterpiece is a moving and engaging study of youth that continues to retain its significance today . Definitely worth seeing , perhaps even worth buying if you're a film buff . The Criterion Collection DVD is excellent and provides a very insightful glimpse into both the movie and Truffaut .

431129	1173088	388795	9.0	A powerful film - - see it for what it is , and try to ignore the controversy	Those who have protested Brokeback Mountain have likely seen few movies in their lifetime . There's nothing all that daring or new here ? two famous young stars playing gay lovers ? Wow , that's a first . Unless you are aware of a film called " My Own Private Idaho " released a decade and a half ago . You could even be daring enough to claim the first gay cowboy movie was Midnight Cowboy . And let's face it ? sexual taboo has been a regular theme in many European films for years . The only difference here is that Brokeback has hit the mainstream and it's been in the Oscar competition , which means more people are likely to be made aware of it ? and attack it . The bottom line is : it's not really deserving of the hype about it being a " gay movie . " It is , however , far more deserving of its critical hype ? the praise critics have bestowed upon it for being a good movie . Because it is a good movie . It's a very good movie . Ang Lee is a fine director ( if overly ambitious at times ? his Hulk was a failure because it tried too hard , the opposite of most comic-book movies ) ? this is his swan song . At times it is subtle and quiet and at others deeply moving , featuring a graceful dramatic arc that makes a wide sweep across many years in the lives of two men who " ain't queer " but are inexplicably drawn to each other as time progresses . The interesting aspect dealt with here ? and what makes it better than the gay-exploitation romantic-drama it could have easily been ? is that Lee's film studies the impact a forbidden relationship has on two men over a span of time . Both men ( played by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal in the best performances of their careers ) become married and have children ? but they also both return to Brokeback Mountain , the place that sparked their secret relationship . There are moments that go on too long or are too slow . There are also a few scenes that cry out , " Independent ! " ( It's got that new Focus Features edge that " The Station Agent " and " Eternal Sunshine " both also had . ) However , for the most part it's a masterfully shot motion picture that deals less with homosexuality and more with the concept of love in general . I don't think the movie's intent is , as some people boycotting Wal-Mart for selling the film have claimed , " to spread homosexuality . " Anyone who becomes gay after seeing a movie about gay cowboys probably wasn't very straight to begin with . If you see this film , see it for what it is ? don't focus too much on the controversy , because it's just publicity at this point . But underneath the controversy-hype there's a really strong , powerful film ? yup , far superior to " Crash " ( which insulted my intelligence ) ? waiting to break free . A lot of people will feel uneasy watching it ( voting statistics on IMDb reveal that the male demographics are responsible for much lower votes than women ) . Then again , a lot of people will just refuse to even give it that much of a chance and will bash it without even seeing it . That's a shame .
430452	1173088	408306	9.0	One of Spielberg's best - an important and thought-provoking film	" Munich " is not an easy film to watch - it is realistically ( and sometimes gratuitously ) violent , it is disturbing , it can be rather hard to follow at times , and it is quite long ( at nearly three hours ) - but it is a rewarding film that provokes thought . . . something which , unfortunately , many Hollywood films fail to accomplish these days . It is very loosely based on the aftermath of Black September and the 1972 Munich Massacre in Germany , during which eleven Israeli athletes were slaughtered by Palestinian terrorists who had tried to use the hostages as leverage in a political battle . Following the attack , the Israeli government assembled a crew of Jewish men to travel across West Europe and assassinate the figures involved in the planning of the events in Munich . The team of five is led by the character portrayed by Eric Bana , and he begins to wrestle with his own tormented conscious as he questions whether his actions are just or if he is merely being used as a pawn to carry out secret government killings . The cast is top-notch , and it's one of Spielberg's most well-directed films in ages . It's refreshing to see this after a string of generic no-brainers such as " War of the Worlds " and " The Terminal . " This echoes " Saving Private Ryan " and " Schindler's List " as some of the riskiest material Spielberg has worked with , but he manages to pull it off without taking sides ( as many have tried to twist it into some type of Israel - . vs . - Pakistan debate ) . He also manages to take the material - of which there isn't much available documented facts - and make it compelling and engaging without necessarily going out of his way to distort facts . In his DVD introduction , Spielberg explains that creative liberties had to be taken simply due to the fact that no one has " come out " yet and really released any definitive information on what , exactly , happened after the Munich massacre . The only thing that's known is that a group was assembled , and nine of eleven targets were assassinated across Europe in the months that followed . The film provokes discussion and , although some better editing could have brought its runtime down a good twenty minutes or so , Spielberg proves once again that when he's at the top of his game he really is a great director - one can only hope that he begins to work like Scorsese and choose his projects more carefully .
430708	1173088	75213	9.0	One of John Wayne's best films , and sadly his last	" The Shootist " was John Wayne's last film . He died of cancer shortly after its release . Ironic , then , that his character in the movie is a " shootist " dying of cancer out west in 1901 . His doctor ( James Stewart ) gives him a short period of time to live . He decides to take an easier route , and returns to his old stomping grounds in order to find a quick and painless death . Along the way he meets The Son ( Ron Howard in one of his early roles ) , and a various assortment of other characters , in his search for suicide . Don Siegel ( " Dirty Harry " ) has always been one of my favorite directors - - he's made some truly terrific films in his career . " The Shootist " is one of his best . The last thing we expect in a John Wayne film is a dying , frail , pessimistic human being . We get it . Books , the titular " shootist , " is arguably Wayne's deepest character he would ever play ; and his story is one of the most compelling of Wayne's entire career . The acting is top-notch , the direction low-key , subtle , and effective . It's hard-edged , just like " Dirty Harry " ( 1971 ) : bloody , violent , a bit over-the-top ( if it were made in Hollywood today it would probably look a lot like " Kill Bill " ) . Yet the film's best moments are those involving its character , Books , and his strange quest for death . This movie strikes chords on many different levels . It's a really good film , one of the best of the 1970s , one of Don Siegel's best , and one of John Wayne's best , too . And that's saying quite a lot .
430197	1173088	72962	9.0	Contains some of the best and most invigorating editing you'll ever see	F For Fake is Orson Welles having a lot of fun . But it is also an example of the power of effective editing ? simply put , this is some of the most impressive technical cutting , swiping , panning , scanning , freeze-framing and elaborating ever put on film . It moves quicker than any other Welles film , and in fact according to the critic Jonathan Rosenbaum in his excellent Criterion Collection essay , Welles had purposely tried to separate this from his typical directorial style . The result is a film showcasing the limitless possibilities of passionate film-making ? Welles was clearly in love with his material , and it shows in every frame . An entire year was allegedly spent just editing this film , and the time was well spent . The rest of the film is just as unique ? nothing like this has been done before or since . Welles called it a " new " type of movie-making : a mixture of documentary and essay . It opens with Welles performing a simple magic trick ; the camera is all around him , barely allowing audiences any time to follow what's happening . Soon Welles begins to narrate the movie , but ( and this is what really separates it from most documentaries ) there is a decidedly theatrical quality to the proceedings . Welles chronicles the true story of the famous art forger Elmyr de Hory ( as well as his official biographer and future fraud , Clifford Irving , who penned the Howard Hughes autobiography - that - wasn't - really - an - autobiography ) , but it doesn't feel like a documentary at all . If you do not share Welles ' passion for the subject of fraud and deception ( he even recaps his own infamous War of the Worlds broadcast which nearly cost him his job at RKO ) , this may be a bit tiring to sit through . As one reviewer noted , it's Welles at his most personal , and this is both good and bad ? good because Welles is so gleeful and joyous that it's totally infectious and , if you let yourself , it's easy to be caught up in the free flow of the film . But the bad part of this is that Welles allows himself to dabble in vices ? he devotes the opening credits to shots of his mistress Oja Kodar and her back-side as she walks around a Mediterranean city catching the glimpses of men everywhere . And the finale ? in which Welles tells an elaborate story about Kodar ? turns into a fun and well-edited - but extremely overlong ? verbal game between Welles and Kodar , preceded by an even more tiring sequence of Kodar once again walking around in provocative clothing , eventually shedding them and being captured on film in the nude by Welles for an extended length of time . And , also , as another commentator of the film has claimed , this is a movie riddled with 1970s film-making techniques ? many of which seem outdated today . Yet , despite its flaws , a lot of them work to the film's advantage in the long run . The freeze-frames may be outdated but they help the film to develop a very distinct style which , in turn , enhances the amazing editing job . If not for anything else , see F For Fake simply because it contains some of the best editing you'll ever see in your life . If you are a fan of Welles or share his love for the topic of deception , you'll find this to be a very enjoyable and fun little detour . It was Welles ' last true finished film before his death and it seems somewhat fitting that he'd sign his departure with a project such as this : one crafted from deep passion and filled with joy and wit and wonder .
429603	1173088	73766	10.0	Exceedingly hilarious , very warm , and one of my favorite comedies . . .	A hilarious Neil Simon comedy that evokes laughs from beginning to end . The late Walter Matthau is the grouchy ex-comedian who is persuaded to join together with his ex-partner ( the late Oscar-winner George Burns ) for a final reunion show on stage . Benjamin Martin is Matthau's agent and nephew , and the two have just as much chemistry as Matthau and Burns . I love Matthau's grumpy character - - he's just the same as he always is , and yet also very different . Burns , as the absent-minded old man , is just as funny as Matthau . Matthau : Want some crackers ? I've got coconut , pineapple and graham . Burns : How about a plain cracker ? Matthau : I don't got plain . I got coconut , pineapple and graham . Burns : OkayMatthau : They're in the cupboard in the kitchen . Burns : Maybe later . Or how about this : Matthau : When I did black , the whites knew what I was saying ! You've got to see it in the movie to understand it ! All in all , a refreshingly hilarious , sweet , heartfelt , warm , belivable character comedy with a heart and some of the most memorable quotes of all time . They just don't make them like this anymore ! In a time when all the newest comedies are crude , juvenile and stupid , this leans back towards the tender core of what comedy really is - - funny characters , smart and funny dialogue , and grand entertainment . One of the best buddy comedies of all time , right up there with " Planes , Trains and Automobiles , " " Lethal Weapon , " and " The Hard Way . " You may have a hard time finding this for rent or on TV , but trust me , it will be worth your time ! stars . - John Ulmer

429487	1173088	250797	10.0	Unheralded	What would you do if you found out that your spouse was having an affair outside of your marriage ? Most likely what most people do when it happens to them - - go to marriage counseling or seek a nasty divorce . Edward ( Richard Gere ) does something different : he kills the man his wife is seeing and tries to cover up the crime . It is , in a way , the perfect murder - - no one else knew about the affair his wife was having , no evidence traced the victim to his killer . At least that is what Edward thinks as he rushes to attend his son's school play . Soon the irony starts and the tension builds . Edward gave his wife , Connie ( Diane Lane ) , a snow globe as a present . She then gave it to her lover ( Olivier Martinez ) . And when Edward finally confronts his wife's newfound boy toy prior to the killing , he sees the globe sitting near his bed . " Where did you get this ? " he asks , before delivering a massive blow to the side of his enemy's face and inadvertently killing him with the glass ball . It's an accident . He didn't mean to kill the man and he didn't even mean to overreact . But as the reality of the affair bombards his senses , Edward literally collapses , sent into a spiraling downfall of vengeance and anger . It's Richard Gere's best performance - - ever . I'm not a fan of Gere , but he brings so much raw intensity and reality to his character here that it's hard to not realize his performance as one of the best of the decade thus far . Observe his facial features as he examines the bedroom of his wife's lover . Imagine yourself in his place and imagine yourself not reacting the exact same way . But Gere is also able to bring a touching sense of love and humanity to Edward . His affection for his wife is as clear as sparkling water , and the day she comes home after encountering her new boyfriend he suspects something is wrong . Watch Gere in this film and you'll soon find yourself reconsidering whether or not he's that bad of an actor . I know I did . And you actually empathize with him . This is the man whose films have made more money the more he has become naked on-screen ; the man who is renowned for being a playboy hotshot and a sleazy celebrity pretty boy . But yet in " Unfaithful , " Gere abandons this self-made image , and plays a meek , nerdy family man living a modest life with a wife and a son . He wears glasses , lives an ordinary wife and actually respects his wife . His performance is spot-on and heartfelt , to say the least . I could have imagined almost anyone playing this role , except Gere . His performance is amazing . After killing Martinez and dumping the body in the back of his car , Edward takes the snow globe home . He places it on a shelf behind many other souvenir globes . Imagine Connie's surprise when she sees it there , and imagine the irony in the situation : they both know that they know each other's secret . Yet since they both are shameful of what they are done , they are too scared to confront each other , for fear of being accused of their own crimes . " Unfaithful " is one of the most elegant and firmly constructed thrillers in years - - realistic , cruel , ironic , and irreverently erotic . It's not your standard-issue sleaze . It's not all heavy on sex and style like " Basic Instinct " and it's not pure stupidity , either . It's actually a thriller rooted in a touching story of marriage and faith , and everything else gradually follows thereafter . Like " A Simple Plan , " " Bound " and " Fargo , " " Unfaithful " is about one single event that suddenly causes a chain reaction of horrific ones . In " A Simple Plan , " the moment that Hank took the cash was the moment his life changed forever . The moment that Corky's plan proceeded forwards in " Bound " was the moment that all hell broke loose and everything went wrong . And the moment that Jerry Lundegaard sent those two bumbling idiots on their way to kidnap his wife and hold her ransom was the same moment in time that his life would begin to dramatically fall apart , almost overnight . And the moment that Edward strikes his wife's lover with a small glass snowball is the moment that both of their wives - - his own and his wife's - - change forever . I love these sorts of movies , the kind that take your average , innocent passersby and place them in an unfortunate chain reaction that leads to a major downfall in their lives . Why do I love these movies ? I think for the same reason that has made them all so successful : we love to watch characters corrupt themselves and get caught in conspiracies where they are literally fighting to stay above water . The scene in " Fargo " where Jerry's plan falls apart all at once is a great example of this . This is Adrian Lynne's crowning achievement . It's glossy and masterfully , beautifully constructed . It's eerie and realistic and has a noticeably strong , yet strangely subtle , presence . I cannot imagine a more effective , sensitive and touching adaptation of this story that will surely hit close to home for many people out there . Even if it's not relative to your life , you will still find yourself deeply absorbed by the lead characters and their turmoil . " Unfaithful " has its flaws , but I find it hard to think of a more effective and beautiful thriller of its genre made within the past five years . stars . - John Ulmer
430596	1173088	120669	10.0	" We can't stop here . This is bat country ! "	" Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas " is a twisted , outlandish venture into the mind of a warped junkie , a reporter who is traveling to Nevada in order to cover a Hells Angels motorcycle race , along with his Samoan attorney Dr . Gonzo ( Benicio Del Toro , who gained forty pounds for his role ) . " We were somewhere around Barstow when the drugs began to take hold , " is the line that opens the movie in an expeditious manner , as a red convertible roars from right to left , in the direction of Las Vegas . The vehicle's trunk is packed with an abundance of deadly drugs . " We had two bags of grass , seventy-five pellets of mescaline , five sheets of high-powered blotter acid , a salt shaker half full of cocaine , a whole galaxy of multicolored uppers , downers , screamers , laughers . Also a quart of tequila , a quart of rum , a case of beer , a pint of raw ether , two dozen amyls . " The narrator of the story is Raoul Duke ( played by Johnny Depp ) , a balding , stumbling shell of a man , constantly smoking or inhaling drugs , his body overloaded with deadly substances . He is in a permanent daze throughout the entire film , constantly consuming drugs every time the camera pans onto him . He is also the reporter , the main character of the film , and he is in such a daze that after the motorcycle race is over , he's not even sure who has won . So sitting cramped in his increasingly trashed hotel apartment , he begins clacking away mumbo-jumbo on his typewriter , desperately trying to make sense of the seemingly frenzied world surrounding him . The year is 1971 , the beginning of the after-effects of the frivolous sixties . Raoul still seems to think that he is living in the past decade . He explains that his carefree ways were out of place for such an area as Las Vegas , and in one of the funniest scenes in the entire movie , he visits a conference detailing the dangers of substance abuse , and inhales cocaine throughout the seminar ( led by the late Michael Jeter ) . The movie is based on the semi-autobiographical memoirs of Dr . Hunter S . Thompson , who traveled to Las Vegas in 1971 with an overweight " Samoan lawyer " named Oscar Zeta Acosta . According to Thompson's novel , " Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas , " originally published at the end of the decade , they broke many laws and were essentially high on various dangerous substances the entire time . In his novel , Thompson used the character Raoul Duke as a relation to his own past , and the pair's psychedelic weekend as a metaphor for the Lost America . After the sixties , during the Vietnam War , Americans were deeply confused , and turned to many dangerous substances for answers . Some critics claim that " Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas " glamorizes drugs . If anything , it demonizes them ( sometimes quite literally ) , and the constant drug use is merely present to account for the duo's wacky behavior . That's not to say that " Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas " is a harmless film . Under the wrong circumstances , it could be misunderstood , which is why it was nearly slapped with an X-rating by the MPAA , and - - along with the book - - caused outrage when it was released in 1998 , alongside the utter disaster " Godzilla . " Depp is the reason the film's narration succeeds as well as it does - - a lesser actor might come across as annoying . Depp seems to be channeling the physical freedom of Steve Martin and the slurred speech patterns of Thompson himself - - although he was given ample time to pick up on Thompson's mannerisms , since they spent much time together prior to shooting and throughout the filming process . But what is essentially so fascinating about " Fear and Loathing " is its blazing style and blatant uniqueness . Brought to the screen by Terry Gilliam ( " Monty Python and the Holy Grail , " " Brazil " ) , one can only expect the movie to be strange , but it is severely distorted to the point of insanity . What is even more intriguing is Gilliam's use of his camera , cinematography and backgrounds - - the camera essentially takes on the role of a third person , as it is constantly moving , positioned at awkward angles against harsh , dizzying backdrops , wallpapers and carpets . The overall effect of the movie is the equivalent of getting high - - only this probably isn't as dangerous . Probably . In some ways , " Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas " is an utter mess of a movie - - pointless , sick , but yet it is also occasionally hilarious , and I found myself very entertained . I am not usually a fan of these sorts of movies , which only helps account for my extreme surprise in finding that I not only enjoyed " Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas , " but found it to be an important art house movie - - bizarre , mystifying , strange , bewildering . It is as if Fellini directed a Cheech and Chong movie . It is an experience unlike any other , and although I can completely understand the negative reviews it received upon its release years ago , I find myself somewhere in between the haters and the die-hard cult fans . The film was released on a Criterion DVD last year ; a sign that despite its infamous background it actually has a fairly strong legion of fans . In some ways the movie is as confused and wandering as its narrator . It's somewhat pointless , but incidentally , I think that is the point .
430665	1173088	85995	10.0	How To Make A Timeless , Original , Hysterical , Satirical Comedy .	Every summer Chevy Chase takes his family on a little trip . This year he went too far . Chevy Chase stars as Clark Griswold , the typical American businessman . Well , almost a basic businessman . He works in food preservatives . Beverly D'Angelo plays his wife , Anthony Michael Hall plays Rusty , his teenage son , and Dana Barron plays his daughter Audrey . This summer , Clark has decided to go all out and take a vacation with his family to " Walley World , " a theme park spoof on Disney World , owned by " Roy Walley " . Basically , this film starts out strong and ends strong . There are many gut grabbing scenes , and the film never resorts to gross out humor . The biggest gross out is when Clark bites into a sandwich a dog leaked on , but that's a different story . Along the way to Walley World , everything and everything that can go wrong does , and Clark ends up with Aunt Edna ( Imogene Coca ) , who adds more fun to this wallop of a comedy . The laughter just escalates more and more as we see Clark's dreams flush down the toilet farther and farther , and I can't tell you how much I laughed at some of the scenes . " Vacation " isn't typical National Lampoon fare . Chevy Chase gives by far his best performance ( akthough he acts just as well in " Christmas Vacation " ) as Clark , a real optimist , go get'm kind of guy , who completely snaps toward the end of the film . The rest of the cast does well , and Beverly D'Angelo does surprisingly well as a house wife . The two children , Audrey and Rusy , squawk at each other , but not to the point of obnoxious , which is another good thing about this film . Is it no surprise that John Hughes , the king writer / director of the 80's comedy films wrote this , or that Harold Ramis ( Groundhog Day , Ghostbusters , Striped , Analyze This ) directed the film ? With cameos by the likes of John Candy , Eugene Levy , Brian Doyle Murray ( who played Clark's boss in " Christmas Vacation " ) , and more , " Vacation " is a comedic triumph of the eighties that is now an icon of how to make a good comedy . stars - - John Ulmer
429899	1173088	98621	10.0	Works on so many levels	DeVito is a hit-and-miss director . He's turned out some very good films and some very bad ones . Sometimes his satire just falls short ( " Death to Smoochy , " for example ) ; however , " War of the Roses " is his strongest directorial effort to date . It's got everything - a clever script , great interaction between its two stars , exciting thrills , funny gags ( without ever resorting to unnecessary crudity ) , and to top it all off , the direction is very effective - DeVito is heavily influenced by Hitchcock and that is very clear in the final sequence , which is reminiscent of " Vertigo " and " Rear Window . " Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner play the Rose couple - two once-happily-married people who are now , after many years together , bitter and at the end of their frustration . Deciding upon a divorce , they begin to split apart ; however , negotiations regarding belongings begin to go awry as Oliver Rose ( Douglas ) demands more from his wife , claiming it's his money that purchased their enormous house and all objects inside . DeVito turns in a performance as the narrator , and Oliver's lawyer , who tells us at the start we are about to watch a sad tale about divorce . By the time the film has ended we've seen events spiral totally out of control - beginning with absolute believability and ending in absolute absurdity . That's the crucial part of all this . Black comedy relies on whether the dramatic arc of the content - the leap from reality to lunacy - can be believable . Many times in DeVito's film , it isn't . " Smoochy , " for example , was clever satire at first , and fairly reminiscent of real-life people and events ; then it turned into an over-the-top revenge rampage . " War of the Roses " is more careful , and the arc is subtler . It's believable because the characters are given such room to grow and their conflict blossoms throughout the picture . I'd classify " War of the Roses " as one of the funniest , cleverest and most underrated black comedies of the 1980s - it's one of my personal favorite movies and never fails to crack me up . A cult film ? Maybe ; but I think many more people would enjoy it if they gave it a chance .
430246	1173088	109447	10.0	I can understand why peopl may dislike it , but I can't understand why people literally hate it - it's not all THAT strange . . .	The thin line between insanity and brilliance often amazes me . On one hand we have films like " Clifford , " the 1994 box office disaster starring Charles Grodin and Martin Short , that everyone claimed was one of the worst films of all time . Then we have the " Being John Malkovich " es , that are so strange and weird , yet everyone calls them masterpieces . What's the difference ? One is a comedy people went into expecting something straight-forward , and the other is a piece of art ? Puh-lease . The tagline for " Clifford " reads , " What's the difference between Clifford and a pit bull ? One will tear your heart out , scare your friends and wreck your house . The other one is a dog . " If you found that tagline funny , " Clifford " is for you . If not , then it is not for you . Personal taste comes into play here very much . I personally enjoy " Clifford . " Call me a horrible filmgoer , I don't care . It's just with all the crap I've seen in my days , " Clifford " is not only a pretty good movie when compared to others , but also a refreshingly naughty comedy . It unfortunately falls apart in the last ten minutes , really getting crazy . But then again , so did " Malkovich . " The film opens up in the year 2050 . A young troublemaker is trying to escape from a futuristic private school . He is stopped , however , by Father Clifford ( Martin ) , who looks like Dick Clark's lovechild with . . . well . . . Martin Short . Anyway , Clifford sits the boy down and teaches him a lesson . He tells him a story from when he was younger , and when he was a practical joker . More like a homicidal maniac . Clifford's story begins in present day . Clifford is now a small boy , but he is still played by Martin Short , oddly enough . At first he appears a normal enough child , happy and bright and just a bit overly creepy . Clifford and his parents are on a flight to Hawaii for business purposes . Clifford wants to land in LA to visit " Dinosaur World , " a theme park that I would have loved to visit when I was a dinosaur-crazy kid myself . Through Clifford's evil , creepy and manipulative ways , he gets into the cockpit and almost crashlands the plane . The pilot decides to land in LA to make sure the aircraft is unharmed . In LA , Clifford's parents drop him off with his Uncle Martin ( Charles Grodin ) , an aspiring architect , busy with his fiancee ( Mary Steenburgen ) and plans for a new Los Angeles subway route . His pesky boss ( Dabney Coleman ) is always on Uncle Martin's case , so he has barely enough time to devote to Clifford . Clifford's parents leave , they fly back to Hawaii , and Clifford gets anxious . He wants - or needs - to visit Dinosaur World as soon as possible , and Uncle Martin just keeps blowing him off . This makes Clifford mad . You may be wondering what happens when Clifford gets mad . In all truth , it's best not to spoil it . He doesn't turn green , he doesn't grow extremely large and bear muscles - he just unleashes ultimate havoc upon those opposing him . Take , for example , the scene where Clifford , mad at his Uncle Martin for going back on his word ( he said he'd take Clifford to Dino World and didn't ) , puts hot sauce in Uncle Martin's bloody mary , so that when Uncle Martin goes to propose a toast his throat gets a bit hoarse . Or when Clifford pieces together recordings of his uncle to make it sound as if he has a bomb planted under City Hall . Clifford is the ultimate pest , a spawn of Satan . Everyone knows someone like Clifford , but Martin Short stretches his character a bit more . Clifford is an odd child . He responds with gleeful joy and says things like , " Oh , yes , my dear Uncle Martin ! " We are supposed to sympathize with Clifford by the end of the film , but the problem is that we don't know how or what to sympathize with . Short makes Clifford more of a devil than a rascal , and we never truly get the sense that he is a human . By the end of the film , we're not all that sure if Clifford is human or not , or whether that evil streak is gone , and that is one of the film's flaws . Other than that , it's a general OK comedy . People don't seem to like it very much - at all - but I have seen much , much worse , and in all truth I actually laughed at this movie . More than once . Which is more than I can say for films like " Daddy Day Care . " Yep , " Clifford " is OK by me . stars -
430079	1173088	64665	10.0	Much better than expected	I sat down to watch " Midnight Cowboy " thinking it would be another overrated ' 60s / ' 70s movie . Some of my favorite films come from the ' 70s , in the same vein as " Midnight Cowboy " ( " Taxi Driver , " " Mean Streets , " " Panic in Needle Park , " etc . ) but there are many , many overrated ones as well that have gained strong reputations amongst critics for being groundbreaking - unfortunately a vast majority of them don't hold up as well today . I sort of feel this way about " Easy Rider . " ( Although it , too , is one of my favorites . ) So , I didn't expect much from " Midnight Cowboy " but got a lot back . It's a touching story , well-made and well-told with some of the best performances of all time . Dustin Hoffman , as Enrico " Ratso " Rizzo , gives one of his best - it's a bit funny at times ( he sounds like a cartoon character when he speaks - maybe because of the Lenny / " Simpsons " connection ) , but Hoffman is entirely convincing . Half of the film's budget went towards his paycheck as he was just becoming a major star in Hollywood . Opposite him is the second-billed Jon Voight as Joe Buck , the " cowboy " who travels North to the Big Apple in the hopes of becoming a male prostitute . Soon his naive ways land him in trouble and he pairs up with a crippled scam artist named " Ratso " - who offers to become Joe's " manager " for a certain percentage of profits . The movie is quite long at two hours but never really seems very long . Some films can tend to drag , especially some of the films that were made in the ' 70s because ( as it's been said in " Easy Riders , Raging Bulls " ) the directors were the stars of the movies in the 1970s and occasionally they got a bit too infatuated with their material , going on too long examining characters / scenes / etc . that aren't important . Just about the only scene I felt was a bit too long and unnecessary was the drug party - it makes the film seem extremely outdated ( similar to the drug odysseys in " Easy Rider " ) and really harms its flow because it's not needed . Other than that , " Midnight Cowboy " is an almost flawless motion picture . I was pleasantly surprised . It does have its flaws ( flashbacks are a bit tacky and never used as well as they could have been , for instance ) and some of the scenes are a bit uneasy ( such as the gay movie theater sequence ) but if you can handle its content " Midnight Cowboy " is a truly great motion picture , an uncompromising examination of life on the streets in the late ' 60s / early ' 70s . It's a depressing movie , yes , and by today's standards might seem a bit outdated and heavy on the liberal perspective of " life is horrible , etc . " . . . but I still love it and particularly the extremely touching ending will stay with me for a long , long time . Highly recommended . One of the best films of the ' 70s . ( It was technically released in late 1969 but I'd still categorize it as a 1970s film . It also won the Best Picture Oscar , being the first - and only - X-rated motion picture to do so . It was later re-rated R on appeal . )
429293	1173088	85334	10.0	Classic Christmas film that doesn't age	Ralphie ( Peter Billingsley ) wants a Red Rider BB Gun for Christmas but his mother is totally against it - the " you'll shoot your eye out " discussion being a major opposition . This is essentially a story about childhood and is very spot-on in regards to the yearning of children and the whole Christmas era - I've been watching it since I was a child and every Christmas when it comes on TV I watch it again . It's funny , poignant and totally memorable - it has some of the best scenes of all-time and although I know a few people who dislike it because it's a bit " weird " and " dark , " most people I know love it . Worth watching every Christmas , forever !
429606	1173088	37638	10.0	Wrong Turn	" Detour , " directed by Edgar G . Ulmer , is one of the few rare motion pictures of any era that stays with you long after the credits fade away . Like " D . O . A . " ( 1949 ) , " Detour " is a B-movie filled with an uncountable number of imperfections and flaws , yet its haunting narrative and excellent lead character helps engrave it in our memory . Like " Fargo " and " A Simple Plan , " " Detour " is about a seemingly innocent and brief idea that soon unravels and turns into a dreaded nightmare . It all tarts with Al Roberts ( Tom Neal ) , a lonely , self-pitying hitchhiker who recalls his story to us in a beaten and dingy diner . A man in the diner starts to play a song on the jukebox : " I Can't Believe You Fell in Love with Me . " " Turn that off ! " Al yells . He doesn't like the song , and we have a feeling we're about to find out why . He starts his story at a time when he was a happy piano player with a girlfriend named Sue . After tiring of the poor life , Sue decides to travel to Hollywood in order to find a new job . Left stranded by himself , Al soon musters the courage to make the long trek to California by himself . Once there , he'll reunite with Sue and they'll start a new life . Along the way , Roberts is picked up by a traveler named Haskell ( Edmund MacDonald ) , a nice fellow who is so trustworthy that he even lets Roberts drive the vehicle part of the way to California . He also reveals a nasty scar on his hand to Roberts , and says that some " dame " bit him a while back along the road . After Haskell dies of natural causes in the car , Roberts is left facing the opportunity of alerting the police of the death or burying the body far from sight . Realizing that the police wouldn't believe him if he told them his story , he decides to take Haskell's ID , clothes , and money . ( " It seemed like an awful shame to leave all that money there . " ) Convinced that he's done the right thing , Haskell crosses the border into California and soon finds himself picking up a fellow hitchhiker named Vera ( Ann Savage ) . But , as Haskell so adequately puts it , why couldn't she have been a different girl ? Why did it have to be the girl that Haskell gave a ride to the day before ? " Where'd you bury his body ? " she barks . She doesn't believe his innocent story after he tells her . But she is a ruthless young lady , " No older than twenty-four , " and doesn't care about his innocence - - she just wants to make some money out of the ordeal . Her idea is so ridiculously outrageous that Roberts soon schemes a way to escape her grasp . The film is a brutal one , both literally and figuratively . Filmed in six simple days with an ultra-low budget and some fairly unknown actors , " Detour " is proof that sometimes films don't need to be well made to be entertaining and effective . Here is a movie so technically poor that our narration begins with lighting in the background being shut off and a flashlight beam being shone down upon Neal's face . But , as silly and amateur as this may sound , I thought it was one of the most haunting narrative techniques of all time - - a haunting technique that colorized filming would never be able to accentuate upon . I enjoyed the acting in " Detour " very much , especially after hearing how " ham-handed " it was . Tom Neal - - who comes across as a sort of moody , earlier version of a frustrated Kurt Russell - - is a real scene-stealer . His portrayal of a man slipping down a steep slope , unable to return to the flat surface , is extraordinarily good - - and I imagine quite controversial for the time . The implications of what his character does at times during the film are often the sort of stuff that would disturb today's audiences . Neal , as our film noir's hero , is probably one of the oldest anti-heroes of all time . In today's age there are doubts over whether or not his story is essentially true or fabricated - - did he really kill Haskell with his own hands and make up the rest to satisfy his own sense of self-satisfaction ? We'll never know the true answer . Part of what makes this film so engagingly playful is the way it twists everything about so that we never really know for sure what's happening , or what's about to happen , even on multiple viewings . Its director , Edgar G . Ulmer ( who I am not related to as far as I know ) , had previously united Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff for the first time in " The Black Cat , " filmed eleven years prior . " The Black Cat , " also filmed on a fairly low budget , is a major cult horror film to this day - - and was a fairly popular film at the time ; the equivalent of Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees ' infamous showdown in last year's " Freddy vs . Jason . " So it's strange to think that Ulmer , a German refugee from Hitler , would lower himself to the depths of die-hard B-movie-making . " Detour " is far from a perfect motion picture . It's often quite corny , and seriously flawed in terms of filmmaking . Sometimes you can tell where two scenes were spliced together to form a whole . In fact , the entire movie was essentially filmed in a car with a rear projection of California landscape and a hotel room . Here is indeed ample proof that aspiring directors need not always worry about all the technical quirks . It helps to make a good movie a great one , but more important is a good story and fine characters , and if anything , " Detour " more than makes up for its literal flaws with strong storytelling . - John Ulmer
430736	1173088	80455	10.0	One of the best comedies ever , and the best " SNL " I can think of . . .	There's something funny about the actual Blues Brothers , Jake and Elwood . You don't even have to hear them say anything particularly funny to laugh at the sheer sight of the wacky duo lined up against one another , wearing the infamous clothing and sunglasses . And since their appearance on " Saturday Night Live , " and then later in their milestone feature film , they have infiltrated society . " The Blues Brothers " ( 1980 ) is , and will remain as far as I see it , the funniest " SNL " skit adaptation to ever hit the big screen . The problem with adapting characters from 5-minute skits on " Saturday Night Live " is the fact that they are just that - - 5-minute skits - - and are not substantial enough to merit any type of further focus . Backdrops are not needed - - all we need are quirky characters with distinguishing traits or gestures that will make us laugh . " The Ladies Man , " " The Coneheads , " " A Night At the Roxbury , " and " Superstar " are all examples of material stretched too far - - basically just skits multiplied by their original running length some 15 or so times . In fact , there are really only two or three feature length movies with " SNL " characters that are any good . I love " Saturday Night Live , " but even I have to admit that some things are not meant to be turned into a movie . I'd rather see a compilation of the character's best moments on the show hit the big screen as opposed to a weak plot-driven film about them doing many unfunny things a quarter as funny as anything on the television program . " The Blues Brothers " has a great plot ( considering it's an " SNL " film ) and a great pair of characters . Jake Blues ( John Belushi ) has just been released from prison , greeted by his taller ( and more slender ) brother Elwood ( Dan Aykroyd ) . They visit the old Catholic home where they were raised as children by " The Penguin , " and are instantly thrust into a mission to save the orphanage by raising a ton of money before it is due to close . How will they do this ? Reunite their old band , of course ! But it won't be easy , because in the process they get entangled in the affairs of a Neo-Nazi and a heavily armed woman ( cameo by Carrie Fisher ) . They also get entwined in a bunch of musical sequences with blues legends such as James Brown , Aretha Franklin , and Ray Charles . ( John Candy also stars in this film , and in John Hughes ' masterpiece " Planes , Trains and Automobiles , " he did the " mess around " to Ray Charles ' song on the radio while driving an awful car . ) It's all in the name of fun , of course . Oh , and in the name of God . Quoting Elwood , " We're on a mission from God . " Not exactly a laugh-out-loud line of dialogue , but the more you think about it , the funnier it becomes . All my readers are probably aware of the fact that I absolutely love " Saturday Night Live " and all its actors . ( Well , most of them . ) Especially the older posse of actors such as Bill Murray , Chevy Chase , Dan Aykroyd , Steve Martin ( frequent guest host ) , John Belushi , et al . They're like dear old friends and every time I see them on old reruns of the television show I get instant nostalgia . When you become a fan of " Saturday Night Live , " you enter a sort of small group of friends you've never even met . You just somehow feel very close to the actors and their friends . John Landis , the film's director , was one of those close friends of Dan Aykroyd like Harold Ramis . The Blues Brothers are two of the best characters to ever come out of " Saturday Night Live . " We've seen a lot of characters like Mango and Mary Katharine Gallagher lately , but the best characters are the fondest - - Wayne and Garth , The Lounge Singer , The Coneheads , The Cheeseburger Guy , The Blues Brothers . And just about any character Steve Martin plays . I can't explain why I enjoy " Saturday Night Live " so much - - is it the humor ? the acting ? the familiarity feel ? - - but I can say that I DO love it , and I love " The Blues Brothers . " Sequels can become nasty things or splendid things , and " The Blues Brothers 2000 , " which reunited Aykroyd and Landis ( the director ) , was a failure . A compilation of musical sketches and a terribly recycled plot , it was a sure sign that The Blues Brothers themselves worked not only because of Elwood but also because of Jake , and " The Blues Brothers " the movie worked not because of a recycled plot but because of an original one . ( And here's advice for the filmmakers : never , ever replace John Belushi with John Goodman ever , ever again . ) I am sure that anyone who enjoyed " Ghostbusters " or any type " SNL " - alumni film will absolutely adore " The Blues Brothers . " I mean , this is the stuff legends are made of . Jake and Elwood Blues , two of the most familiar faces of all time . How can you not laugh at this film ? It's impossible . Yes , it's a bit long , and yes , you have to sit through some blues music ; but they're The Blues Brothers . What else would you expect ? stars . - John Ulmer
429868	1173088	117951	10.0	One of the best films ever - a lot of people missed the point	It's ironic that I'm saying " many people missed the point " because I did , too . My original review on IMDb gave the film a negative rating . I deleted it months ago because I have since purchased the Director's Cut on DVD and fallen in love with it . The movie is energetic , imaginative and unique . It's taken from Irvine Welsh's novel , which I now really want to read . It's about a group of heroin addicts ( led by Ewan McGregor's Renton ) in Scotland who can't seem to live past their addiction . . . everything centers around drugs . " Trainspotting " was condemned for promoting drug use , but I agree with fellow reviewer Bob the Moo who claims this was a misinterpretation on the media's behalf - yeah , it may show drugs as being " funny " at times ( like Renton's wacky hallucination ) but it certainly doesn't glamorize them . Some of the sequences are sickeningly realistic and depressing - like the scene with the baby . That's tragic stuff , and totally unexpected . It's also effective because by that point in the film we care about the characters enough for it to affect us on an emotional level . The movie was really popular in the UK but never got much acclaim overseas . Americans in general will always be less liberal and be quicker to damn films for their messages . " Taxi Driver " was hailed by Europeans in ' 76 . . . can't really say the same for US critics - it was a huge split in opinion at the time . Ditto here . Most Americans didn't really " get it " and the only attention it received was the controversy surrounding the appearance of Mr . McGregor's genitalia . Oh , the humanity ! If you haven't seen " Trainspotting " yet , I highly recommend it . Don't be turned off at first by its bleak humor and sick content - I won't lie , it IS a rough ride . . . but by the end , it's worth it .
431144	1173088	1125849	10.0	One of the best films of 2008	Enough has been written already about Mickey Rourke's real-life parallels with his fictional character in The Wrestler . Yes , it makes the story seem even realer , and is perhaps what attracted Rourke to the project . ( Or perhaps not ? perhaps , instead , it is what attracted Darren Aronofsky to the actor . ) But to focus on such surface similarities seems like an undermining of his work here . Rourke may not be as out-of-his-comfort-zone as Sean Penn in Milk , the only other Oscar-worthy lead performance this year , but that is merely a testament to his fundamental understanding of his character : Randy is an understated guy with big scars , both literally and figuratively . He's been wrestling for years ? now reduced to borderline tribute shows in front of dwindling crowds , scrounging up barely enough cash to buy the variety of drugs and steroids he needs to maintain his weight . He lives in a trailer park and gets locked out for not being able to keep up rent . He works part-time at a grocery store and visits strip clubs regularly , because it's the only place where he seemingly has any meaningful connections with another human being ? namely the dancer Cassidy ( played by Marisa Tomei ) , who is similarly a bit older than most peers in her " profession , " yet doesn't really know any other way to live . The Wrestler draws immediate comparison to the classics of working class cinema , including Rocky and On the Waterfront . Sylvester Stallone returned to his iconic character two years to bring resolution to the life of Rocky Balboa , the Philly boxer who got back in the ring for one final match . It was a good film and touched on similar themes ? a nice guy stuck in a mean world , an estranged child ? and ultimately both films present us with the dilemma these men find themselves in : too old to continue doing what they know best , and too old to learn how to do anything else . Whereas Rocky Balboa was a trip down memory lane , it was hardly as bleak or frank as The Wrestler , which is a vastly superior film . Darren Aronofsky has established himself with this picture as one of the most important of modern American filmmakers ; to acknowledge that this work is from the same man who directed The Fountain is astonishing , because they couldn't be farther apart on a sylistic level . The Wrestler is grainy , low-key and rough . It isn't polished , fantastical or elaborate . And that suits the material perfectly . The fact that Aronofsky was willing to almost entirely reinvent his approach for the benefit of the story is more than admirable . He deserves a nomination . Tomei is wonderful in her supporting role , fleshing out her character ( again , both literally and figuratively ) with greater competence than most actresses would probably be able to manage , because it's a fairly obvious role ? the " stripper with a heart of gold " who is the object of desire for the gruff guy with a tortured soul . Yet she manages to strike a balance in the film as one of two female roles , the other belonging to Evan Rachel Wood as Randy's emotionally severed daughter . The Wrestler is impressive for all its smaller parts as well as the larger ones . When Randy goes to visit his daughter , the reaction is fleeting ; it's not overly dramatic and revelatory , like most films of this nature often create such scenes to be . We can tell by her reaction that it's not the first time Randy has attempted to reconcile with her , as she seems unfazed by his appearance on her doorstep . It is in this fashion that the film jumps through all the mandatory hoops of its genre ( think , of all things , The Royal Tenenbaums ) , yet still manages to seem fresh and realistic . And then there's Rourke . As aforementioned , he deserves the Oscar nom he's likely to receive . And he should probably win . This is one of the best performances of the decade , perhaps even of all time , if we really want to get down to it . It's the best work of his career , at once the most fully developed of his characters and the most imperfect . Randy isn't airbrushed to make him seem more appealing to the audience ; Aronofsky and Rourke exploit his faults and present him as a normal man , tempted by vices and haunted by his past . Yet we recognize that the drugs , the empty sex and the generally self-destructive behavior Randy partakes in is rooted in the same emotional enguish that the actor himself seems to carry with him ; Aronofsky spotted this quality in Rourke , and he fought the producers for Rourke over their first choice ( Nicolas Cage ) , and his dedication paid off ? you'll be hard-pressed to find a more convincing , moving or memorable lead performance this year . Ultimately , The Wrestler is one of the year's very best films ? a character study that is at once timeless and powerful . And it's helmed by a director who has managed to bounce back from an aesthetically pleasing but shallow art-house film to produce one of the great works of American cinema in the 21st century .
429877	1173088	694432	10.0	Live from New York !	Incidentally ( or coincidentally ) the very first episode of " Saturday Night Live " debuted on October 11th , which is the same day of the month as my own birthday . I've always felt it was appropriate that my favorite show shares its birthday with me ! Of course , in recent years it hasn't been my favorite show as much . . . with guest hosts like Paris Hilton and a cast of untalented dimwits like Tina Fey , it's a real shame the show has fallen as far as it has . I remember that skit David Spade did once about Eddie Murphy : " Look children ! It's a falling star ! " Well , the tables have turned . This first episode is classic , though , and although it's very different from the way the show became in later years , it's very fun . Unfortunately " SNL " hasn't been released in season box sets on DVD yet ( fingers crossed for HD-DVD or Blu-Ray releases ) , but if you can track down this first episode from 1975 you'll be in for a treat ( it airs on E ! sometimes ) .
430112	1173088	306926	10.0	Great live performances of great songs	This brief collection of videos was recorded live in Tokyo , 1992 , as part of Guns N ' Roses ' worldwide Use Your Illusion tour . This volume ( part " II " ) provides some songs from GN'Rs ' # 1 billboard hit , including " Estranged , " " You Could Be Mine , " " So Fine , " and " Knockin ' On Heaven's Door . " It also includes older hits such as " Sweet Child O ' Mine , " " Rocket Queen , " " Move to the City , " and of course , " Paradise City . " The performance highlights also include a live rendition of the " Godfather " theme and a guitar / drum solo . Axl Rose was a truly great frontman . One problem he did have was all the damned running around on stage . The " UYI I " video is even worse , but here he's still running about constantly , and it just makes his singing less effective . He quickly runs out of breath . It's one of the reasons I felt the intense criticism from fans regarding the 2002 VMA performance was moot - his live voice has never been a good indication of his studio vocals . Sometimes he delivers great live performances , but a lot of times - such as here - his energetics make him lose steam too fast . His voice is still awesome , but it's not as awesome as it could be if he just cut out the lame running back and forth from one end of the stage to the other . Anyway , apart from Axl's somewhat shady vocals , for the most part this is excellent . Slash looks a bit drugged out and he's not into the guitar stuff as he could be - he's Axl's opposite , he just stands there and plays the notes . He could use a bit of energy injection . The DVD is nice but isn't really that big a deal - in fact they could have easily combined both volumes of the Tokyo performance onto one DVD .
429562	1173088	44741	10.0	The affirmation of life through the exploration of death . A powerful film .	" Ikiru " is a film that expresses itself through two separate parts . The first half is the exploration of a bitter man's death and the second half is an affirmation of life provided through the awareness of mortality , recalled by those whom he knew best . Kanji Watanabe ( Takashi Shimura ) is the protagonist of the story , a bureaucrat whose job provides him with little more than paper-shuffling and pen-pushing . The movie opens with an x-ray of Watanabe's stomach and the cancer that thrives within it . His doctor tells him he will die soon . Throughout the first half of the film , Watanabe stumbles about helplessly , remembering his life and trying to figure out what has come of it . He lives with his son , whose resentment for his own father has peaked over the years . Watanabe realizes no one in his life actually knows or loves him . He walks about in a permanent stupor of self-loathing . He embarks on a friendship with a younger female co-worker , but even she soon hates him and thinks he is " creepy . " Towards the end of the film , Watanabe finally dies and the second half is the recounting of his final days by co-workers . We realize Watanabe's life changed drastically towards the end and he dedicated his final days to the construction of a playground for children . The Criterion DVD is excellent , and inside is an essay written by a Kurosawa biographer . He notes that the film is a study of existentialism and mirrors a few themes from Orson Welles ' " Citizen Kane , " which is true - I was very much reminded of Welles ' film at certain moments throughout " Ikiru . " Both films offer solid examinations of life and death and what propels the man stuck in between - in both cases the cruelties of life broke apart the men , leaving hollow shells where souls once existed . In Watanabe's case , his seeking of his own soul finally brings him to a state of contentment and inner satisfaction - his death is , at the beginning of the film , a lingering doom ; and at the end a peaceful pact . This movie can change the way you look at life if you open your eyes . Kurosawa might have made better films but " Ikiru " is his most emotionally resonant and powerful that I've seen .
430309	1173088	272338	10.0	This movie isn't exactly " When Harry Met Sally . . . "	" Punch-Drunk Love " is a lot of things . It's the change of direction for an actor . It's the change of acting for a director . It's odd , demented , and strangely entertaining . It could be called a form of art , which it probably is . It is good , but not particularly great . Adam Sandler plays Barry Egan , a lonely , sad man with seven sisters . Barry has violent outbursts sometimes , and the most likely reason is because of the way his sisters treat him . Barry admits that he doesn't know if he's normal or not because he doesn't know how most people are . One day he meets Lena ( Emily Watson ) , and they go out to dinner . Barry starts to fall in love , but trouble starts when furniture outlet owner Dean ( Philip Seymour Hoffman ) sends out four blond brothers to get money from Barry . Why ? Because Barry called a phone sex line the night before and gave out his private information . Now Barry must protect Lena and show Dean who he's messing with . " Punch-Drunk Love " is a really weird movie . Think " Being John Malkovich , " " Magnolia " and " Happy Gilmore . " Barry Egan is a rage-oholic , just like Sandler's other character Happy Gilmore from the said movie . As you probably well know , " Happy Gilmore " is about a hockey-player who becomes a golf player , and beats up a lot of people in the process . " Punch-Drunk Love " runs in somewhat the same veins . In one scene , when Barry and Lena are eating dinner , Lena tells Barry that his sister told her a story about Barry throwing a hammer through a glass door , and Barry excuses himself , goes into the bathroom , and tears it apart , destroying it limb from . . . toilet paper holder . The biggest thing I heard about this movie was how good Adam Sandler was in his role . Many who dismissed his comedies praised him here . I always enjoyed his comedies ( most of them , anyway ) , so I didn't have any reservations about admitting Sandler did a fine job , which he did . His character is quiet , loney . He tells a dentist in once scene , " I don't like myself very much . " There's a different side to this Sandler ; he's not as cocky and self-assured as he was in , say , " Happy Gilmore " or " Billy Madison . " He's different . Maybe too different for his fans . When he finally confronts Dean at the end of the film , he says , " I have love in my life , and it makes me stronger than anything you could ever imagine . " If someone approached you a year ago and placed a bet that Adam Sandler would ever treat women with respect in a movie of his , I bet you'd counter it . But I guess strange things happen . The entire film is very odd . There's a Charlie Kaufman vibe running through this movie . Paul Thomas Anderson - P . T . Anderson to his fans - brought us " Boogie Nights " and " Magnolia . " " Boogie Nights " clocked in at about two and a half hours , " Magnolia " at three + . " Punch-Drunk Love " is eighty-eight minutes . This might be the sign of a talented director changing courses , or a talented director taking a break from his more weighty motion pictures . Whatever the sign , the film is a bit too wacky and never really explains things like it should . But it's a fine film to watch , and there's nothing particularly awful about it . I found myself liking it more than I thought I would after seeing the trailer . Besides , it's probably the only time you'll ever watch a romantic film where the star-struck lovers say , " I love you so much I could smash your face in with a sledgehammer . " This movie isn't exactly " When Harry Met Sally . . . " stars - John Ulmer
429848	1173088	120917	10.0	No Touchie , NOOOOOOOO touchie . . The best Disney movie ever	This is absolutely the best disney movie ever . I don't know how they got David spade to do a Disney movie , but he definately made it good . If it wasn't for him it would still be good , but not as good as it is with him .

I would recommend it to everyone . - PLOT - Greedy self centered emperor Kuzco ( David Spade ) gets turned into a Llama by his evil advisor Yzma ( Eartha Kitt ) . Now in order to get back to his royal throne , he must work together with Pacha ( John Goodman ) who lives in the town he was about to destroy to turn into his own summer getaway ( complete with water slides ! ! ) SEE THIS MOVIE-PERIOD .
430472	1173088	476635	10.0	Awesome collection of AC / DC songs !	If you're an AC / DC fan you'll love this collection ! It has many early TV broadcasts from Australian channels and progresses onwards through their fame and fortune . I saw some old videos on here that I had only heard about in the past ; I met a die-hard AC / DC fan packing my household goods when I was getting ready to move and he said that some of the stuff on the DVD he had been waiting years to see . I'm not into AC / DC as much as some others who have reviewed this are , but even from a moderate fan who knows most of their songs I was really impressed by this compilation . You can tell they really had the fans in mind when they put this together . All music DVDs should be this good !
429296	1173088	56218	10.0	Perhaps the greatest political thriller of all time ! Not very dated at all	I picked up the Special Edition DVD of " The Manchurian Candidate " because I kept hearing it was a classic , and felt it would be a good addition to my collection . I'm a huge fan of John Frankenheimer ( " Seconds " is one of the most underrated and un-acknowledged films of all time in my opinion ) and his directorial style here is just as distinct as always : the cold distances , the skewed close-ups , etc . His presence is in every frame , and I continue to be baffled by the fact that even many film critics don't consider him to be a great director . Frank Sinatra gives a worthy performance , although it is inferior to Denzel Washington's in the remake . Angela Lansbury is totally creepy and convincing but the real scene-stealer is Laurence Harvey . As in the remake , it's his character who is the most fascinating , multi-layered and believable - Harvey gives a terrific performance ( and Shriever , too , in the remake ) , which is unforgettable . Overall this is a classic movie and it still holds up well today - it's a big step forward for film-making ( violence , swearing , and sexual content in a 1960s film that certainly paved the way for the movies of the ' 70s ) , and from its performances to direction to script to entertainment value , it's an all around . Highly recommended .
