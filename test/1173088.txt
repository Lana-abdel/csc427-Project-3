430940	1173088	240900	1.0	The Worst Film of 2002 ? Maybe . . .	I think we can all agree unanimously that teen films are getting worse and worse every year . John Hughes ' teen flicks from the 1980s were very special , because they showed " real " teens in " real " situations , and not the stereotypical figures present in all teen films these days . " Not Another Teen Movie " may not have been a great flick , but at least it had the courage to try and spoof all the other films from its genre - " Slackers " doesn't ; it just becomes another teen flick . Here's what we've got : The Three Cool Guys ( one of which is an Ugly Cool Guy who should be a Dork ) on Campus get blackmailed by The Geek , who wants The Hot Girl , who is interested in The Head Cool Guy , who tries to get The Geek hooked up with her , but ends up falling in love with The Hot Girl . The Other Two Cool Guys get hooked up with other Ugly Girls , and The Geek remains a geek . There always has to be a small band of cool guys breezing past school , there always has to be a geek , there always has to be a pretty girl , and there always has to be the girl everyone thought they wanted but found out they didn't after all . " Slackers " is about The Three Cool Guys ( including " Night of the Twisters's " Devon Sawa ) who are happily cheating their way through college , until The Geek ( " Rushmore's " Jason Schwartzman ) sees them cheating and blackmails them . He wants to get hooked up with The Hot Girl in school , but as I said before , The Hot Girl is interested in The Head Cool Guy , and so when The Geek finds out what's going down he gets mad . This film is so basic it hurts , but even when you think it can't get more basic . . . it does . The director , Dewey Nicks , has got to be one of the most untalented slackers ( har-har ) to ever film a movie . Every scene is not only handled with minimum care , preperation and outcome , but shots are suddenly split in between other shots , and imaginations are put into sudden shots . Maybe one time is original , the fiftieth time it gets annoying . It's like a really bad music video that just won't stop playing . Among these very badly cut scenes is one where Jason Schwartzman is talking to two girls and suddenly imagines them licking him all over , then it cuts back to them talking , then licking . Another is when The Three Cool Guys start imagining themselves bicycling and shooting " Star Wars " guns and being chained to a bed by a transvestite . That didn't make sense , did it ? No . It doesn't when it suddenly appears in the film , either . I saw Devon Sawa's first breakthrough role , TV's " Night of the Twisters , " and I then saw him in " Wild America . " What has happened to him since ? " Idle Hands " and " Final Destination " and " Extreme Ops " is what , and honestly I don't think I hear many people talk about him at all . I blame it on " Slackers " ; right as his career as an actor started to take off he got stuck in the middle of this wretched film . Eh , I never really liked him anyway . I do , however , like Jason Schwartzman , who showed some real talent in " Rushmore , " which was a bit of a teen movie but had more originality , flare and humor than this film . ( It also starred Bill Murray . ) " Slackers " has made me lose interest in Schwartzman , because I cannot honestly understand why a young man with so much talent would choose this script over all the others he could have had at this point in his career . " Slackers " has made me lose respect for everyone involved in the project . If you like any of the actors involved in this horrible production classified as film , I suggest you stay away from it . stars - John Ulmer ( P . S . - Notice the unbilled cameo from Cameron Diaz in the film . )
430719	1173088	165303	1.0	Not the Worst Ever , BUT . . .	Definitely one of the worst films of 1998 , if not THE worst , " The Godson " lacks one fundamental element of comedy : Humor . The cast , including Rodney Dangerfield , Dom DeLuise ( who spoofs Don Corleone ) , and Kevin " Kids in the Hall " McDonald , would make you think this film a riot . However , it is quite the contary . The jokes all fall flat , including the excrutiatingly unfunny " bank " skit , that just went on and on until I was squirming out of my chair - not from boredom ( well , not ONLY because of boredom ) - but because like many of the " jokes , " it outstays its welcome to a point of discomfort . Overall , this movie is one of those films that should be seen only if you're in the mood for it . Which SHOULD be never . stars - John Ulmer
429805	1173088	246464	1.0	One of the Worst Comedies of the Year . . .	When I first saw ads for this film , I thought it looked great . A great comedic cast , a good director , and excellent material to be based upon . Unfortunately , due to September 11 , the film had to be postponed . I didn't realize this at first . When I didn't see it show up in theaters , I thought I must have missed it and it had bombed . But I found out it was just postponed . When it finally did come out , I never got a chance to see it , because it literally was off the box office in one week . After reading numerous bad reviews on " Big Trouble , " I feared it would be a " Big " flop , so to speak . Still , underneath this , I still felt certain that it received negative comments just because of , and no one could enjoy " dumb " comedies anymore . Maybe because I am a fan of Dave Barry - - though I never read the " Big Trouble " novel - - this helped make my decision . Regardless , after so many bad reviews , I had low hopes for the film , yet at the same time , high expectations . So I rent the film , pop it in the DVD player , start it up , and : it's a bit funny at first . I chuckled at the Frito joke in the very beginning . Then , I liked the parody on Dave Barry - - it was probably in the novel . Dave tends to make fun of himself . Tim Allen plays a pulitzer prize-winning ( sound familiar ? ) writer for the Miami Herald - - Dave's real job . Anyway , I found that funny , and started thinking , " Boy , this IS going to be good ! " Boy , I was in for a " Big " Surprise . The film quickly deteriorated into a horrible , unfunny joke . The only funny thing about this film was that it claimed to be comedy . Tim Allen , who I thought would be the main character , narrates in the beginning . But , all of a sudden , we're shows a bunch of characters , including : Rene Russo , Stanley Tucci , Denis Farina , Ben Foster and DJ Qualls . Not bad actors in any sense of the word ( well , at least the first three ) , and not a bad scenario . Unfortunately , what ruined it is how we are thrown into it . I felt like saying , " Whoa , hold on , what ? " It's so hard to follow . Then , we are introduced to more characters , including Tom Sizemore , who I've always enjoyed seeing on screen , especially in war films ; Patrick Warburton , who in my opinion is a funny guy . Perhaps it's the way he talks with an almost Clint Eastwood-like low hiss . Hard to explain . Anyway , he's a funny guy , but the film isn't . If it's a Russian bar , to a goat on the road , to an airport scene that parodies airport security ( I doubt that would be in the film now ) , Big Trouble had so much potential , but the way it was edited was horrible . Tim Allen is barely in the film , then is thrown in at the end to save the day . . . " Big Trouble " is one of the worst comedies I have seen this year . It pains me to see Dave Barry's comic humor go to waste . I wondered why he didn't help at all with the production of the film - - he probably knew it would be a flop . Or , is it " Big " flop ? stars - - funny in the beginning , but deteriorates quickly into a dumb , unfunny film .
429435	1173088	468424	1.0	Can reality TV become any more degrading ?	This show is literally depressing to watch . I've seen two or three episodes now , and wish I hadn't . After they were over , I was disgusted . Essentially this is just a TV show where a camera crew follow around the " Playboy Bunnies " in the Playboy Mansion . If you don't know what Playboy is , who Hugh Hefner is , what Playboy Bunnies are , or anything about porn , chances are you will have no interest in this whatsoever . I know all of the above and it still made me feel sick . Obviously a certain portion of this is scripted for dramatic effect and viewer appeal but , I think , probably very little . These bleach-blonde bimbos are incredibly stupid , selfish and appalling . Yeah , they're hot . But when they open their mouths , you feel like vomiting . It's kind of sad to see Heff ( at age 79 ) courting these girls . The Head Bunny , a . k . a . " Heff's Girlfriend , " is probably no older than 30 . All the girls kiss him and he fondles them . . . twenty years ago Heff was a god . Now , he looks like one of those disgusting old pervs in shopping centers who stare at young girls all day . He's the type of guy you want to call the cops on . And he's loose in his own mansion surrounded by dozens of beautiful women . Likewise , they are taking advantage of him - they know he'll die soon and they're really milking his old-age for all its worth . They get free rooms as well as free food and the best thing of all : they get paid for being sexy and rich ! The richer and more beautiful they are , the more they get paid . The more they show , the more they get paid . Apparently , all they have going for them is their looks - they are dumber than I don't know what . They are so stupid some of the episodes are painful to watch . They made me feel sick in my stomach - the Bunnies are gorgeous ? Sure . But good god , they're ridiculously dense . In my opinion , the only " plus " about this show is that we get a rare glimpse inside the Playboy Mansion . . . but ol ' Heff will be dead in a few years , and supposedly according to his own wishes the mansion will soon thereafter become open to the public . Now THAT will be fun .
430360	1173088	497633	1.0	I don't care who you are - - this is not funny .	Larry the Cable Guy represents everything wrong with America today . He embodies the racism , intolerance , crudity , immaturity , and generally unpleasant nature of a lot of people . He's an unfunny bigot - - but more than that , he's a fraud . He claims to be from the south - - and indeed has built his entire comedy career on this - - but he actually grew up in the mid-west and his name is Dan Whitney . He doesn't actually speak with a southern twang accent - - it's all a persona he fits into to make money . There are some rare video clips of him out there where he speaks without an accent , any redneck " Git-R-Done " fans should check them out for a shock . I was watching an interview with " Larry " on CMT a few nights ago and he said he doesn't pay attention to the detractors because he " does this for the fans . " He admitted that most of his fans are 14-year-old boys and therein lies the problem : Larry appeals to young teenage boys , and his entire comedy routine is the equivalent of visiting a random teenage boy's home and eavesdropping on his conversations with friends . Larry does something that another annoying loudmouth fraud , Carlos Mencia ( real name : Ned ) , does : if you don't laugh at his jokes , he says you don't understand them . Or he talks down to you . When people don't laugh at his crude toilet humor , Larry says , " I don't care who ya are , that's funny right there . " Right . Maybe for those of us who lived near nuclear plants as children . Larry spews wonderfully humorous one-liners , such as , " You ever tuck your weeny in between your legs and look in the mirror to see what it'd be like if you were a girl ? " Yeah . Great stuff , Larry . A very prescient , witty and insightful comedian . He's the next Lenny Bruce .
430333	1173088	299712	1.0	One of the worst films I've ever seen - not even Mickey can save it	I watched this on TV because the digital cable guide listed it as a film " starring Mickey Rourke . " Little did I know all he had was a very brief cameo in the film , yet it was enough for them to advertise his name all over the listings . In fact it actually stars a Tom Cruise lookalike named Daniel Cosgrove who suspects little bugs ( cockroaches and that sort ) are planning to take over the world . The film is shot in a gritty , blue-filtered way - like those TV cop shows ( Law & Order , NYPD Blue , The Shield , etc . ) but the problem is that the " reality " feel of the movie betrays its utter absurdity - - please , LITTLE BUGS ATTACKING THE WORLD ? ! What is this - - the 1950s ? ! The worst scene has to be the very ending ( SPOILER AHEAD ) when all the little bugs " form together " to create one giant , enormous " bug " that attempts to kill the hero . The way he " kills " it is laughable at best . It's not worth watching - not even for Mickey .
431164	1173088	181689	1.0	Dissapointing	MINORITY REPORT was okay , but after all the hype , I got a weird sci-fi movie with a TOTAL RECALL 2 plot ( for anyone that doesn't understand , Phillip K . Dick , who wrote the short story WE CAN REMEMBER IT FOR YOU WHOLESALE-which was turned into a famous movie named TOTAL RECALL with Schwarzenegger-also wrote the MINORITY REPORT , which was actually nearly made TOTAL RECALL 2-and Arnold would've been in it instead of Cruise probably . I'm not making this up . It's in the commentary on the special edition total recall DVD . ) Anyway , MINORITY REPORT bored me halfway through . It was slow , and Tom Cruise was once again full of himself . Why can't anyone else see this ? Anyway , the movie wasn't as bad as I'm making it sound , but it was a dissapointment . It was also very predictable . If you want a good sci-fi see Total Recall , the prequel to this ( if you remember on mars in TR , the mutated aliens are psychic , THAT'S why they were going to make TR 2 instead of Minority Report .
430635	1173088	116669	3.0	Extremely poor , manipulative " comedy " - full of problems	I had looked forward to JACK when it first came out back in 1996 . I remember renting it when it reached video and being severely disappointed . Williams , first of all , is good at channeling a child - we all know that already . The problem lies in the film's schmaltzy , good-natured , sugar-coated outer layer that is sickeningly fake and annoying . Coppola hasn't really made a good movie I can think of ( or , a good movie worth remembering at least ) since THE GODFATHER PART III ( and not many will even agree with me on that choice ! Some might go as far back as APOCALYPSE NOW in ' 79 ) . It's disappointing to see him resorting to the hack-job he does here - ANYONE could have directed this movie . I never , ever - in a million years - would have suspected it was the product of Francis Ford Coppola . The movie's ending is " feel-good " - but not in a good way . Instead , when it's over , you feel as if you've just watched a 2-hour soap opera spliced with moments of awkward comedy . The plot would be great for a silly comedy ; unfortunately , Coppola turns his movie into some sort of half-cocked drama / epic-wannabe . Simply put , it isn't .
429891	1173088	87298	3.0	Sigh .	Plot summary : Big man with machete kills people . Cannot be killed because he is already dead . Seeks revenge on the camp counselers who let him drown as a child . Wants to avenge his mother's death . Add : Annoying kid actor ( Corey Feldman ) who outsmarts Jason . Gratuitous : Sex , nudity , violence , bad acting . Final product : Even worse than the first . This was supposed to be the " last chapter " but , ironically , it was followed by about a gazillion more entries . This is one of the worst . It's just Jason going around swinging a machete at people . I truly don't understand the success of these films - doesn't anyone else get bored by this crap ? ?
431122	1173088	369226	3.0	It's not even fun to watch and make fun of .	Some of the hatred for this film has been exaggerated . Sometimes people like to have something to rag on no matter what - right now , for the Internet film community , it seems to be Uwe Boll - and judging from quotes I've read by him , as well as movies I've seen , he deserves a lot of it . But some of the hatred goes too far . " BloodRayne " was already on the IMDb Low 100 before it even really got launched into theaters . I'll give you an example of the exaggeration regarding this film : One critic I read claimed the opening narration went on for nearly ten minutes , however it lasts perhaps a minute at the most . The dialogue is pretty bad , and the beginning with Christian Slater telling a young child on a plane that his mother is wrong about being afraid of the dark is unintentionally hilarious . There are other gems such as , " Looks like a dead end up ahead . I better take a look . " Or how about Tara Reid - a supposed archaeologist ( hah ! ) - referring to Newfoundland as " New Found Land . " I read here on IMDb that Reid was invited on Jay Leno and wasn't even able to give a definition of her profession in the film . Christian Slater I pretty much just felt sorry for throughout the film - he's such a good actor and his resorting to crap like this and " Hollow Man 2 " is a real shame . I am still hoping he makes a comeback . For what it's worth his performance here actually rises above the laughable material . The special effects are pretty bad , but once again not nearly as bad as I was expecting after reading some message board posts here . Overall I was expecting something so bad I would have a fun time laughing at it . Unfortunately this film is not laugh-out-loud bad , it's just plain BAD . It's not the worst film ever made - it's not on par with Ed Wood - it is actually just equivalent to most Z-grade straight-to-video flicks out there . If Boll's name had not been attached to the project and it hadn't attracted a theatrical run , I'm sure it would have a slightly higher rating on here and less of a " fan base " so to speak . I'm not supporting the film or saying it's remotely good - it isn't - but I am saying it's about as bad as any other straight-to-video horror garbage . I wouldn't recommend it because I didn't even have a fun time watching it for giggles - it's just a really lame film that takes itself way too seriously and perhaps its only positive attribute is that it has some amount of ( admittedly ripped-off ) style .
430632	1173088	63036	4.0	Hugely disappointing	Brian De Palma , Robert De Niro in his first movie . . . it has to be good , right ? That's what I thought . But I was hugely disappointed . " GREETINGS " is no more a comedy than SCHINDLER'S LIST . I didn't laugh a single time , nor grin or smile . It has one good gag , at the very end of the film , and if it had maintained that wit throughout I would have given it a higher rating . However it starts off very poor and only gets worse as time goes on . Made on a shoestring budget , and it shows in every scene . Continuity errors galore . De Palma , who edited the film , clearly has no handle on editing and literally jumps around from scene to scene . So , in one segment a group of characters are talking , and it suddenly jumps to fifteen minutes later in a different room , and they're still talking , and we're left wondering what on earth is going on . I only really wanted to see this because of Robert De Niro . I am a die-hard De Niro fan and will watch anything with him in it ( I even sat through SAM'S SONG , which is even worse than this - by a long shot ) . However De Niro - despite top billing - is not in this film very much , and when he is , he's not very impressive . ( Although he hardly does a bad job , either . ) I couldn't believe De Palma was responsible for this film , it lacks all the typical Hitchcock trademarks of his . However , there are a few references - characters discuss the film BLOW-UP ( 1966 ) which he of course later loosely remade into BLOW OUT ( 1981 ) and at one point a female character subtly picks up HITCHCOCK / TRUFFAUT from a bookshelf and begins to read it . However the rest of this film lacks his typical visionary edge and I suppose it's because he was still learning ( and that's clear in every frame ) . De Palma , never a friend of the MPAA , seems to push the boundaries a lot in GREETINGS and for the most part it's totally unnecessary . The whole subplot about De Niro's peeping-tom habits are disturbing and make us dislike his character - which is a problem since the sequel ( HI , MOM ! in 1970 ) revolves entirely around his character . ( And for the record , GREETINGS was the first film awarded an X rating , which says something about its content . It's not too explicit nowadays , but we're left wondering WHY De Palma had to cram so much unnecessary sex and nudity into his film , because it seems like it's just there for the sake of being controversial - and almost 40 years later it is not controversial anymore , which makes it all the more outdated and pretentious . ) Overall I was hugely disappointed in this movie . It's not funny . It's sophomoric , with stupid editing and direction ( just watch the scene where De Niro and co . walk down a street and De Palma puts it in super-fast-motion - what the hell was he thinking ? ! ) . That , plus an unbearably outdated ' 60s overtone ( and you thought EASY RIDER was outdated ! ) and truly awful theme tune ( it sounds like the Beatles on drugs ) , make GREETINGS a truly disappointing experience .
430117	1173088	119975	4.0	Strangely entertaining	I was in a mediocre hotel in England , up at two in the morning and couldn't get to sleep . I decided to put the TV on and one of the first channels I flipped to was a show starring Christopher Lloyd . It looked pretty bad , but there was something about it that was strangely fascinating . . . I later found out that it was not actually a TV show , but rather a television movie . ( Wow , big difference . ) Christopher Lloyd plays Quicksilver , a mysterious old man who roams the country delivering moral tales . His first he delivers to a newlywed bride whose car has broken down , and whose husband has wandered away looking for a gas station . His tale involves a similar fate involving a man named Charlie ( Matt Frewer ) who picks up a hitchhiker and is nearly killed by him . The next involves a man whose hand is chopped off by his other hand ( ! ) and all the hands in the world start a revolt . Yes , it's as silly as it sounds , and hilarious to watch . The movie is perhaps unintentionally bad , but I was entertained . It's a very corny , silly movie that is easy to watch . The special effects are simply awful in the hand-attack narrative . I loved it . Lloyd is overacting ( or overREacting ? ) in a script full of clichés . Author Clive Barker and director John Landis even offer their not-so-subtle cameos . All in all , if you have nothing better to watch , this WILL keep you very entertained . . . a huge guilty pleasure .
430019	1173088	115813	4.0	Entertaining because it's so poor	Ironically this film was on ABC Family Channel last night , despite its R-rating for graphic violence , language and sexuality . I know it was on pretty late , but still . . . I watched it because I saw Ron Livingston's face and figured it couldn't be THAT bad . . . well , I was wrong , and now I've lost my faith in Livingston . He tries to do a northern accent and fails miserably . It sounds like a cross between Al Pacino in " Carlito's Way " and Sylvester Stallone in " Rocky . " Honestly , it's that bad . This is supposed to be a collection of " modern twists " on classic urban legends . . . it's got it all : Livingston's segment is the one where the newlyweds are in the car that breaks down ; the guy gets out and never comes back , then the woman starts to worry and . . . well . . . you know the rest . It's not particularly scary or well-acted . It's kind of entertaining because it's so bad - it reminded me of the similar collection entitled " Quicksilver Highway . " If you liked that , you'll probably at least find some type of entertainment value here .
429369	1173088	190641	4.0	Dang . Overlooked By the Academy AGAIN !	" Pokemon the First Movie : Mewtwo Strikes Back " is not exactly low 100 material for IMDb , but it is pretty bad . I guess kids would like it if they like the show , but you'd have to be a pretty die hard fan . I guess that's why it's on the low 100 . No plot , no good characters , no interesting parts . Well , maybe some " original " parts , but nothing great . I think what really ruined this film was that awful Pika-Pika-whatever intro about some lightning creature and a bunch of Pokemen / mon . Otherwise , I feel this film would have an average rating of 4 instead of 3 . 3 . stars - John Ulmer
429753	1173088	115509	4.0	Why did they have to ruin it ?	Movies like these do not need sequels . Part of the advantage of Don Bluth moving away from Disney is that he didn't need to suffer their endless tirade of straight-to-video , poorly animated cash-in sequels . But apparently it was someone's brilliant idea to make a sequel to " All Dogs Go to Heaven , " so we get this . Charlie Sheen replaces Burt and he's not really as good . Most of the film is just a poor excuse for a sequel and it isn't nearly as dark , different or entertaining as the original . I feel sorry for future generations who are going to have to suffer endless sequels like this without ever knowing what it was like to have a time when Hollywood didn't totally rely on successful films as a crutch to release banal crap . Please , no more sequels to kids films that don't need ' em .
429387	1173088	109836	4.0	Messy and boring , Kenneth Branaugh's tribute to himself becomes very dull and hard to watch . . .	A boring , and utterly messy retelling of Mary Shelly's classic story sees Kenneth Branaugh as the mad scientist Frankenstein ( guffaw ) and Robert De Niro as The Monster he has created . Interesting in some areas , but overall Branaugh's love of himself gets in the way of the film's narrative . Remind me never to watch a film that shows Robert De Niro's rear for over five seconds ever again . Branaugh's at-the-time girlfriend , Helena Bonham Carter , and John Cleese co-star . stars - John Ulmer
431140	1173088	458525	4.0	Lame .	It's hard to dislike Hugh Jackman , which is why it's frustrating to witness him suffering through a number of films . He's a talented actor who's been stuck in a rut lately , and if anyone was hoping that Wolverine would be a return to form , those expectations may well be diminished within the first few minutes alone : this is just a shockingly messy film . When the much-publicized workprint edition ( notably lacking many special effects ) leaked last month , FOX Pictures was quick to offer that it was an " inaccurate representation of the movie , " and that over 15 additional minutes of footage were missing from the cut . And yet , based on comments I've read from other journalists and fans who saw both versions , it seems the final product is almost identical to the pirated version ? sloppy , awkwardly paced and wholly inconsistent in tone , style and purpose . One minute it's a dark , brooding attempt at Batman Begins-level reinvention ; the next moment it's a campy , over-the-top action spectacle . The film never finds a balance , and it doesn't help that neither of its extremes are particularly effective in their own right : the " dark " moments feel vapid and the lighter moments just seem misplaced , like they're scenes being set up solely to be easily mocked by one of those Epic Movie spoofs . Wolvie loses his girlfriend and vows to avenge her death , and five minutes later he's having a comical boxing match with a fat superhero ( Kevin Durand ) , whose obesity is the subject of jokes from both Wolverine and Wraith ( will . i . am ) . I don't know about you , but if the love of my life was just brutally murdered by my own brother , the last thing I'd do is find room for cracking weight jokes . The movie tries to give Wolverine his humanity , but how can we sympathize with this character when it's hard for us to understand what , exactly , he's motivated by ? His revenge seems more convenient than genuine , especially nearing the end , when a Shocking Revelation generates a hugely underwhelming emotional response . The film was directed by Gavin Hood , whose filmography begs the question : why the hell did Fox hire this guy ? He has a single well-received film to his credit ? Tsotsi ? which was also a low-budget , independent foreign feature . He may well be a very talented independent director ( that has yet to be determined ) , but he is clearly out of his element here , much in the same way that dramatic filmmaker Marc Forster didn't know how to handle the action choreography for Quantum of Solace last year . In both cases , the studios seemed to assume that an established indie director would be able to handle a multi-billion-dollar action franchise , and in both cases , the studios were wrong . This is further evidence of the fact that multi-genre directors are under-appreciated ? just because you're good at low-key character studies doesn't prove you know how to stage huge superhero fight sequences . Rumour has it that Richard Donner stepped in to perform re-shoots early this year , which is ironic given the movie's nod - of all things - towards Superman : Wolverine , on the run from General Stryker ( Danny Huston ) , shows up at the home of an elderly couple in the middle of nowhere . The movie attempts to develop characterization and depth within the time frame of five minutes , which makes the ultra-dramatic outcome of the elderly couple unintentionally funny : it elicited uncomfortable " should-I-be-laughing-at-this ? " reactions in the audience . The proceeding chase sequence ? which has been put forth as the film's biggest action highlight ? is actually rather unimpressive and , at worst , goofy . The special effects are not particularly awe-inspiring , either . Oh , and they manage to add another nod towards an old film : Steve McQueen in The Great Escape . I mean , really ? I haven't even had time to address the movie's numerous plot holes . The biggest one I can't even specify , because the crux of the film rests on its revelation ; suffice to say , it's the perfect example of a film being built around a singular idea than around a fully-developed story . And the movie's wide array of nerd-pandering character cameos just feels forced and distracting ; Ryan Reynolds , as Wade Wilson , is on-screen just about long enough for us to start warming up to him , before he proceeds to rapidly disappear from ( most of ) the rest of the film . Huh ? And what about Dominic Monaghan as Bolt ? Talk about a thankless role . I may be proved wrong , but it's my impression that fans will be upset that their favourite characters are only getting five minutes of screen time , while , to someone like myself , who's unfamiliar with the comic books , these appearances lack reason altogether . Trimming the fat would have made a leaner , more efficient and realized vehicle . There are a few redeeming qualities ? Liev Schreiber works well when the movie is in campy mode , chewing the scenery as Sabretooth . But even this positive is variable , because when he pops up in the darker sequences , his over-the-top relishing is incongruent . It's like if Robert Downey Jr . ' s acerbic , eccentric characterization of Tony Stark had showed up during one of the darkest moments of The Dark Knight : it just doesn't feel right . And that phony darkness is ultimately Wolverine's most prominent flaw : in the era of the brooding superheroes , this film seems like a relic of a bygone era , devoid of any actual intensity , commitment , realism or ? most importantly ? the honesty of , say , Knight or even Iron Man . And the real crime is that it wouldn't feel so hokey , so dated and so desperately misplaced if the filmmakers hadn't tried to make it something it wasn't ; by introducing artificial brood , the film draws instant comparison with its superiors , relegating it to a category shared only by the 2003 Hulk as a superhero movie that at once doesn't know whether to wink knowingly at the audience or Say Something Really Important .

431021	1173088	90856	4.0	Williams looks embarrassed	I used to like Robin Williams . As time has gone on I've come to realize that perhaps I don't very much . When he's funny , he's hilarious . When he isn't . . . it's embarrassing . And CLUB PARADISE is one of the worst films he's made , which is saying something . It's hard to imagine that something so bad could have been directed by Harold Ramis ( usually a rather reliable director / writer ) . The cast all look awkward and the jokes are forced and unfunny . I think CLUB PARADISE is probably one of the only comedies I can think of that doesn't even really entertain on some sort of level . No , it's not totally awful , but it's not amusing which is a huge flaw for any " comedy . " stars
430689	1173088	444734	5.0	Rather pathetic	This was a special TV presentation in 1993 at the height of many of its stars ' popularity . Faces like Scott Bakula and Craig T . Nelson may not translate as well to modern drivers who wouldn't even be able to recognize them from anything at all . Basically , it's an hour-long special that provides dangerous driving situations - and then asks what you'd do in the situation . ( Usually out of four possible questions . ) You have a few seconds to answer with the correct answer , and it's essentially a way of testing your own knowledge of road rules and regulations , as well as how you should act in a given situation . Overall , kind of pathetic - more so because it is outdated rather than because it is poorly made . There is ONE good moment in this that is really touching - the camera focuses on a man who was paralyzed in a drunk-driving accident and we don't know he's paralyzed until the camera pulls back . . . the rest of the special is too commercial , clean , and superficial to really come across as striking and bold . If you have a license chances are you already know everything in here , and all the celebrities ' guest appearances are just to make more people interested in seeing it .

429202	1173088	120716	5.0	Not as good as it could of been , but still a decent movie .	Despite the issues of this movie , it just didn't come out the way it should have . Robin Williams gave a good performance , as always , but the movie itself lacked the dramatic touch it needed . Parts of the story , as well as the lines made the movie more of a dramatic comedy , which doesn't work in a movie like this . If they had kept the drama closer to movies like Schindler's List , Braveheart , and other impressive dramatic films they could have pulled this movie off . They also should've gotten a more dramatic soundtrack , like other great dramas have . Drama is not my favorite movie genre , but in " Jakob the Liar , " they needed more of it .
430377	1173088	65421	5.0	If you don't love this movie you probably deserve to die .	I'm joking again . I actually would encourage people to dislike this film . I find it average at best . As a Disney picture , it's a shameless rip-off of " 101 Dalmations " - only instead of dogs , it's with cats . " AristoCATS " - - ha , ha ! How clever I wonder how long it took them to come up with that one . Basically the Disney formula is in place - animals on the run from a deranged weirdo who has a strange obsession with animals and wants them dead . In this case it's the butler of a rich woman who has left her estate and belongings to the possession of her cat upon death . The butler decides to get rid of the cat and her new kittens and then have himself be put in the will . It's actually rather dark because he kidnaps the cats and plans for them to die in the wild , but they meet up with a street cat who teaches them the ways of the " real world . " If you think this plot is incredibly stupid and far-fetched then you are probably right . But as a children's film you can hardly blame it for being utterly nonsensical and not bearing any sense of reality . If you are a Disney enthusiast you will find something to enjoy here . Some of the musical performances are fun . But it's not a remarkable film or one that is particularly memorable from Disney's canon .
429445	1173088	271285	5.0	A Guilty Pleasure	Face ValueThis movie is about as average as they come . But for being a made-for-TV film , it's not all that bad . Scott Baio , ex-child star in real life , plays a young man who goes to visit an old friend of his who resides in California . His friend's got it all : Nice house , great car , lots of neat accessories , friends , and , or course , women . But after Baio's friend mysteriously disappears , and Baio suspects foul play in a boating accident , Baio adapts to the persona of his friend for a while . But this idea backfires when the bad guys who killed his friend start coming after Baio , thinking they didn't succeed in their job . Or is that what it's all about ? This film is about as average as they come . We've seen it all before , and much , much better . But for being a television movie , it's not half bad . Scott Baio's not the worst actor in the world , even if the others in the film rank high in the " bad actor " category . Director Michael Miller wanders around helplessly trying to decide where his prized film should head - - it ends up in the gutter , for the main part , but let's face it : This movie is nowhere near as bad as it could have become . The script by James G . Hirsch is right out of a TV film , with things like , " Hey , cowboy ! " and weird catchphrases for the characters . The dialogue is stiff and weak - - but again , not as bad as it could have been . The plot - - what little of it there is - - is so average it's mind-numbingly bad . Everything that happens is utterly predictable and there is not one moment of real suspense . But then again , it's a television movie , so I can't blame it too much . I sat down to watch this movie with the lowest of expectations , and I came out with a bit higher of a standard for made-for-TV movies . " Face Value " is awful as a film itself , but as a TV movie ? It's not all that bad . To tell you the truth , it was a bit of a guilty pleasure as I watched it late at night on Friday . A nice film to relax you and take you out for a bit . Just don't look upon it with critical eyes , and you'll find yourself actually enjoying it . stars on a level of regular film , when compared to TV films , brings the average to stars . John Ulmer
429763	1173088	43274	5.0	Classic Disney cartoon but not memorable for me	I am not a Disney fan , perhaps because I grew up in a household with a father obsessed with them . In fact I came to loathe Disney by the time I was a teenager ; I am a WB enthusiast and only like Pixar's films with Disney , along with " Aladdin " and " The Lion King " - which I found a bit more " adult " in nature ( who can't love Williams ' animated impersonation of Woody Allen ? ! ) Some of the classics are good for what they are but in no way are they favorites of mine , and I can't say anyone over the age of 10 is going to enjoy them terribly much . " Alice in Wonderland " is a film I watched often as a child and I have not seen in from beginning to end for many years . I remember it very clearly as well as the musical numbers . I can't say I ever want to watch it again . The book is much better . Actually no it's not , it's just as muddled and drug-crazed . Alice must have been smoking some serious weed in that tree - I'm starting to think the White Rabbit was cocaine or something . I do like the tea party though .
430301	1173088	120188	5.0	" We Three Kings . . . "	The Review " Three Kings " is a grand movie . It's got superbly choreographed action sequences , a hilarious dark side , and one of a human side , as well . Its characters stand on their own and make up their minds about what they want to do , and a lot of the time it's not the best decision . They are on a quest by themselves and they must carry it out . But their human nature may stand in the way . The Setup " Three Kings " is set in the aftermath of the first Gulf War . It involves about four men from the U . S . army finding out where gold is hidden in Iraq , and their mission as they go out to find it for themselves . But before they can take the loot , their human nature gets in the way as they see innocent civilians in a small town being killed by Saddam's armies . So they decide to help the people of the small town , and in the process must choose to take the money and run , or help out , go AWOL , and cross the border with the people to take them to freedom . The Plus ( + ) Side " Three Kings " is a wickedly funny satire on the Gulf War . Only I wouldn't exactly call it a satire . It is more of a dark film with a dark blend of on-the-side humor . And the humor must be acquired ; not all people will find this movie funny . If you do not think a cow being chased around by three military officers in a Humvee and being blown up by a landmine in a bloody mess is funny , this movie is probably not the best choice for you . But it is filmed darkly and is the definition of gritty ; yet , unlike the film " Fight Club , " it still manages to have a wickedly funny dark side of comedy that I found is one of the best elements of the entire film . I particularly enjoy one scene in which George Clooney threatens three men , by saying " would you like to return to your day job ? " All three start thinking about their day jobs back home . One man remembers his job at an airport . Another as a penpusher . Then , one man remembers shooting stuffed animals with a shotgun . He turns to Clooney . " I don't have a day job , sir . " You've got to see it to get it . The Down ( - ) SideThe length of the film in some areas got in the way of my enjoyment , including a scene in a shrine that turned boring and overused pretty fast . But it pays some importance to a character later in the film , so I guess I can't complain . Other than that , the film doesn't really have anything wrong with it . The actors are great , the script is great , the directing is great . The movie is great . The Closing Paragraph " Three Kings " should be witnessed by everyone . Especially if you like dark comedies , violent comedies , dramas , romance movies , and " Fight Club . " You've gotta like one of those , and if you don't , steer away from " Three Kings . " But if you're open to one of the most dark , humorous and gritty war films in recent years , open your ears , shut up and watch the movie . Shh , your popcorn-chewing's getting on my nerves . Evaluation :
430343	1173088	51638	5.0	Really pathetic special effects ; an overall silly and forgettable film	It's the late 1880s and Victor Barbicane ( Joseph Cotton ) has invented a new power source called " Power X . " He realizes it has the potential to boost a rocket into outer space ( or , more specifically , to the moon ) . After some initial flubs he manages to embark on his journey along with his assistant ( Don Dubbins ) , semi-villain Stuyvesant Nicholl ( George Sanders ) , and Nicholl's daughter Virginia ( Debra Pagent ) . Nicholl thinks that Victor's Power X is sacrilege and sabotages their entire journey - - will they be able to get back to earth ? This was presented on TCM as the least successful adaptation of Welles ' material and it shows in every frame . The special effects are really pathetic - even for a 1958 film - and the acting is subpar . The great character actor Joseph Cotten looks utterly bored and disgusted at the fact that he's even remotely close to starring in this film - he basically just stumbles and mumbles through the entire project , and I truly felt sorry for him after seeing such superior films as " Citizen Kane , " " Shadow of a Doubt , " " The Magnificent Andersons " and of course " The Third Man . " If you want to laugh , this is a good choice . If you're looking for something worthwhile ( at least in terms of artistic merit ) - look elsewhere !
429969	1173088	111901	5.0	A very average television show in the vein of " Full House "	Joey , Matt and Andy are three brothers living in Philly in a building above a car garage where they work . The garage used to be owned by their father , but he has recently passed away , leaving the three boys ( one an adult , one a high-schooler and a middle-schooler ) to live with their mother . Every episode of the show would somehow involve a moment where the oldest brother gets in a tizzy and throws a fit , then later apologizes and acknowledges that he still is upset about his father's death . This tension resurfaces in every episode - and gets really old . Obviously his father's death is the foundation of the plot for the show , but that doesn't mean the entire narrative needs to somehow center around this . The supporting cast is rather weak - the other two Lawrence brothers ( they're all brothers in real life ) decrease in acting ability by age , the youngest becoming nothing more than the equivalent of a Mary-Kate / Ashley Olsen " cute " gimmick , and there is of course the comedic role given to a troublesome co-worker at the garage - an overweight slob named Lloyd who eats . A lot . Har , har . Overall it's not surprising to see this was canceled after two years - the characters weren't interesting enough to sustain a lengthy run , and the producers never really expanded the story lines enough . Every time you tune in you're basically getting a variation upon the same concept , and in spite of poor acting and lousy scriptwriting this sealed " Brotherly Love's " fate .
429741	1173088	86465	5.0	OK but too long and not as consistently funny as it probably should be . . .	I just saw Trading Places in its true entirety for the first time in many years . I have often caught various scenes on TV but never sat down and watched it since first viewing long ago . My opinion remains the same . I'm a big fan of Eddie Murphy , a pretty big fan of Dan Aykroyd , and in general ' 80s comedies and SNL - - but this one is a bit too long ( over 120 mins , uncut and unedited w / commercials on television ) - - it does have some very funny sequences and in particular the beginning is great but after that it sort of goes downhill . I thought the plot was incredibly weak and a bit too contrived - - Aykroyd's sudden complete loss of . . . everything was wholly unbelievable . I suppose it could be somewhat believable if not for the fact that Eddie Murphy suddenly replaces him and no one else seems to notice , or care . No business colleagues notice what is going on , etc . Then there's the scene where Aykroyd is walking by the restaurant and sees them all inside . He HAD to know what was going on when he saw Don Ameche with Eddie Murphy . He had to know they had set him up . Why didn't he just go into the restaurant and confront them ? Yeah , it's " just a comedy " or " just a movie " but there's a difference between suspension of disbelief ( which I don't mind at all - - I own Commando ! ) and being downright stupid . It's the little stuff like this I don't like . It starts out as a fairly realistic comedy but is waaay too silly and over-the-top at times . ( E . g . the guy getting put in with a gorilla - funny for a slapstick like Naked Gun , perhaps , but not for an otherwise realistic comedy . ) It would at least be fun if it weren't so long ! There are long gaps were nothing really happens . Many punchlines are clearly supposed to be funny , but aren't . There's an entire scene where Murphy is being given instructions about how Wall Street works and it goes on for about two minutes , before he says " You two sound like a coupl'a bookies to me . " It's supposed to be the punchline to the scene , but it takes so long getting to it , and frankly , it just isn't very funny . Eddie Murphy is usually good at creating likable characters , or at least funny ones , but his character here seemed to just disappear and reappear so often I never really felt as if I was getting to know him - - he seemed more like a co-star . Dan Aykroyd gives a much better performance in general ( or at least he has better material to work with in regards to his character ) . I prefer Beverly Hills Cop ( my favorite Eddie performance ) , The Blues Brothers , Coming to America ( with a clever reference to Trading Places ) and even the mediocre ( but entirely watchable and enjoyable ) Great Outdoors to this . " Trading Places " is OK but certainly not the classic many seem to think it is . It's too long with too many unfunny scenes , the plot is a bit too unbelievable to take seriously , the characters are all over the place and this all creates a cold distance - - it's hard for me to warm up to the movie , I guess .
429499	1173088	450278	5.0	It's either a severely mis-advertised comedy or a terrible horror film - but I will admit I was entertained	I still can't decide whether " Hostel " is a mis-marketed comedy or a terrible excuse for a horror film . It's no surprise Quentin Tarantino produced it - he loved " Wolf Creek , " which was also very gory - but " Wolf Creek " was scary and well-made whereas " Hostel " was cheesy , humorous and so unbelievably over-the-top I didn't know whether to laugh or be afraid . I had heard people talking about the excessive gore - but it's all goofy . The girl with her eyeball hanging out looks like she has a cheap ' 80s monster movie effect glued to her . A few parts made me cringe in anticipation , because I _ thought _ something gruesome was going to happen - but it always turned out being more funny than anything . Some critics said it's a satire of American tourism . I doubt it . I don't think Eli Roth is that smart . I think he wanted to make something fairly tongue-in-cheek while at the same time satisfying his lust for blood . ( He loves blood in horror movies - check out his list of favorites or his previous film , " Cabin Fever , " which is what attracted QT to producing this movie . ) The first hour is a teen sex comedy with three guys ( Jay Hernandez , Derek Richardson and Eythor Gudjonsson ) traveling to Europe to experience a good time . They visit seedy Dutch locales and see loads of American tourists ( " Are there even any Dutch people here ? ! " ) , then travel farther east and wind up going to a hostel where they share a room with two hot , constantly-naked babes who apparently are unaware of the material we would refer to as " clothing . " This is where I began to feel my intelligence become gradually insulted . Was Roth satirizing American stereotypes of Eastern-European countries ? Was he satirizing the horror genre's gratuitous nudity ? Or was he just buying time to get to the blood n ' guts and figured he'd fill up the running time by getting some really gorgeous women naked on set for the hell of it ? I think it was probably the last one . After all the random nudity , sex and American machismo , the movie suddenly veers into " horror " territory by showing weird Slovakian perverts slicing n ' dicing American tourists for their sick pleasure . Uh , yeah ! I forgot to mention something : this film purports to be based on " a true story . " Riiiight . ( According to Roth , he saw a mysterious website once - that he strangely hasn't seen again since - advertising a similar experience for paying customers . I think perhaps Mr . Roth was smoking something at the time , but we'll never know , I guess . ) The rest of the movie is pointless to divulge any further into . Suffice to say , if you like really cheesy movies that rely solely on gratuitous violence to scare you , this will be right up your alley . Personally , I didn't find it scary at all . The beginning - the sex stuff - is scarier than the actual violence later on because it has atmosphere and an air of anticipation - you know something bad is going to happen . And the movie works best in this mode . Once it starts exploiting the torture and violence , it just becomes laughable and predictable . And then , of course , we get the stereotypical hero who is too stupid to realize that if he escapes alone he can send back help for ALL the people rather than risk his life to go back into the hostel to rescue ONE person . Eh , what does he know , anyway . Dumb American tourist . ( See - I can make fun of tourists like Mr . Roth , too ! )
431064	1173088	268677	6.0	A Fine Cast ; A Decent Family Film . . .	Jonathan Taylor Thomas , Howie Mandel , David Hyde Pierce , Jenna Elfman , Marlon Wayans and Tom Bosley make up the cast of " The Tangerine Bear , " a decent family film that features a fine cast and " okay " animation . Tangy is a teddy bear who has tragically been created with an upside-down smile . In this film he basically sits in a toy shop and is a good samaritan to other toys , and of course the sentimental ending is included . The animation may not be great , the story may be a bit dry , but " The Tangerine Bear " isn't that bad . Just decent . It's clean entertainment to be enjoyed around the holiday , which as I write this , is coming up very soon . stars - - John Ulmer
429822	1173088	407304	6.0	A good movie , but Spielberg's version of Wells ' ending leaves a bad aftertaste .	Nobody makes a summer blockbuster better than Steven Spielberg . With " War of the Worlds " he attempts to show the other boys ( namely Roland Emmerich and Michael Bay ) how it's done ? and for about seventy minutes , he succeeds . Whereas " The Day After Tomorrow " relied solely on special effects , and " Armageddon " was downright boring , " War of the Worlds " spends time dealing with its characters , then moves on to the action ; I felt a connection with them , and even as human carcasses are zapped into dust particles by attacking alien tripods , there were basic human emotions at stake that translated well across the screen . Unfortunately , the last twenty minutes of the movie are rushed , sloppy , insulting and oh-so-typical of Spielberg . Even in his evil-alien movies he isn't satisfied with a grim conclusion . Everything has to be wrapped up all nice and peachy . The movie stars Tom Cruise as Ray Ferrier , a dock worker in a small Northern US town who is left to care for his estranged children when their mother and her new husband pick up and leave to head for her parents ' in Boston . At first everything is normal ? his teenaged son and 11-year-old daughter , both of who are less than enthused to be spending time with their biological father , ignore Ray . However , strange occurrences in the weather ? violent thunderstorms and enormous earthquakes - - mark the appearance of a huge machine that rises from underneath the ground and begins to tear apart the town , killing everyone in sight , destroying buildings , and tearing apart the roads . Running scared , Ray manages to find a working vehicle and escapes with his two children ; further north they find similar attacks under way and narrowly avoid death many times , continuing their search for Ray's ex-wife ? or shelter , whichever comes first . " War of the Worlds " is clearly a product of the times . Whereas ten or twenty years ago alien attacks in a Spielberg movie would have surely elicited no response from children , or at most a self-reference to other Spielberg films ( had Elliot from " E . T . " seen " Close Encounters " ? ) , the first thing Ray's daughter ( Dakota Fanning ) presumes during the initial onslaught is that terrorists are attacking America . The movie also deals indirectly with the Bush administration and the war in Iraq ; Ray's son leaves to join the resistance and fight with the Army . " I know you feel like you have to do this , " Ray yells , " but you don't ! You don't have to ! " There are numerous such references , with Tim Robbins ' fanatical underground patriot the epitome of the disillusioned , naïve gung-ho American . The movie marks Spielberg's second collaboration with Tom Cruise ; their first was 2002's Philip K . Dick-inspired sci-fi adventure " Minority Report . " Cruise and Spielberg share similar traits ? both are tremendously popular in their fields and have been around long enough to know what works . The first hour of " War of the Worlds " shows promise because of how well Spielberg and Cruise manage to bounce off each other ? Cruise keeps the human elements under control while Spielberg ups the mantle on the SF / X and disaster . Scriptwriter David Koepp keeps the story rooted in reality while maintaining a science-fiction edge . John Williams ' score evokes the rhythm and patterns of B-budget 1950s sci-fi , and he's clearly having a lot of fun with his orchestra for this soundtrack . But then it all falls apart . The ending is like a hazy dream sequence , illogical and unbelievable . Rarely have I seen a movie so belittled by its finale . I am not referring to H . G . Wells ' ending , of course , but rather Spielberg's tacky additions - the closure is simultaneously insulting and underwhelming . Is " War of the Worlds " a good film ? That's hard to say . As I mentioned above , the setup and first few attacks in the film are great fun . The stark realism and rather gratuitous violence is a nice addition to an otherwise highly unbelievable story ; like this year's " Batman Begins , " the ideas are ridiculous , but the movie treats them as if they are not , and manages to do so without coming across as pretentious and insulting . As it is , this is an entertaining picture , and exactly the sort of film that most people will go into the theater expecting to see ? something to help pass a couple hours and overwhelm the viewer with spectacular visuals and pretty faces . But I can only imagine how much better this would have been if they had taken a risk on the ending . " War of the Worlds " could have been a masterpiece , the disaster movie of all disaster movies ? instead it's just another summer Spielberg flick , and it's disappointing to see a director of his caliber resorting to mediocrity . Spielberg has proved in the past that he's got what it takes with daring projects such as " Duel , " " Schindler's List " and " Saving Private Ryan . " This is not one of those movies .
429178	1173088	113097	6.0	Not great , but good for what it is : an entertaining romantic comedy .	This movie is interesting and unique , in the sense that it focuses on love AFTER marriage , and not before . Billy Crystal plays a basketball referee who travels to Paris in order to bury his recently-deceased father . However alone the way the casket is lost and he's stuck in Paris , where he meets another single woman ( Debra Winger ) who's under similarly unfortunate circumstances . They go out , have a fun time , and then resume their normal lives . Crystal goes back to basketball in the US but soon finds he can't concentrate and keeps thinking about his relationship . Eventually they reunite and get married but it's an uphill struggle . The movie kind of reminded me of " GoodFellas " ( ! ) due to its structure and how it focused on the downfall of the marriage . Like Ray Liotta's marriage in " GoodFellas " it's not all peachy like most Hollywood films portray them as being . My favorite sequence is when Crystal is transporting his semen to a hospital and gets stopped by a traffic cop . Some very funny moments like this , as well as good chemistry between the stars and an interesting narrative structure , make it a worthwhile - if not particularly memorable - romantic comedy , better than many others in its genre . At least it's entertaining and believable .
429870	1173088	338188	6.0	Okay western - better than I expected it would be	This is an entertaining film , and it was a lot better than I expected it to be , given the negative reviews and poor box office returns . Taking place during the 1800s , a woman ( Cate Blanchett ) finds her boyfriend murdered and her children gone - presumably kidnapped by Indians . She enlists the help of her estranged father - a wilderness tracker - to help her track down the children . This movie was unfairly criticized in many regards . I'm not generally the biggest fan of Ron Howard's directorial career , but this entertained me . Jones is well-cast , as is Blanchett . The entire cast is strong , and Val Kilmer even turns up in a surprisingly minuscule co-star role .
430805	1173088	123964	6.0	A very nice surprise	I recently saw LIFE on tv for the first time and I must say I was impressed and most of all SURPRISED . I expected a very rude , crude kind of humor from such " bad boy " actors like Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence-famous for their constant foul mouthing . But LIFE was more of a comedy-drama , that had some very nice sequences , and thankfully was not filled with innuendos , and such . I do know the film has swearing , even though I saw it on tv I can always tell when they're cutting language out of a film , but it still is not as much as one would expect . If you want to have a fun night watching a good film , rent Life . Even if you're not fans of Murphy and Lawrence ( which I can't say I am ) you will still have a good time . It has an uplifting ending . LIFE believe it or not , is just one of those heart-warming comedy films . Enjoy ! stars JOHN ULMER
431128	1173088	399146	6.0	Cronenberg's most commercial film - - and very disappointing	This should have been better . Cronenberg knows how to make a movie . He also knows satire . Unfortunately , he's still struggling with aspects of regular narration , and that is ultimately where " A History of Violence " fails . The point of the movie : violence has an impact , whether immediately or in the long run . But Cronenberg loves gore - he almost has an obsession with it . His penchant for the grotesque makes its way into the film ( shattered noses , faces shredded to pieces by gun battles ) - - the visual effects are spectacular , but they don't belong in a film that tries to balance the effects of violence . It makes his movie a giant contradiction . Another narrative element he struggles with is trying to make a normal movie . As a filmmaker , he's way out there - - " The Fly " is considered ( or was considered up until " Violence " ) to be his most commercial film - - yet even " The Fly " was bizarre . His fans know he's weirder , usually - check out " Naked Lunch , " " Scanners , " " Videodrome " or " M . Butterfly . " The weird aspects creep into " A History of Violence . " It doesn't always work . It does make a tie with the graphic novel it's based upon , but it disconnects from reality , too - - and this film really needs to be rooted in reality to work as a moralistic story . Otherwise it's just lessons from another world that don't apply to our own - and then what's the point ? The good : Ed Harris is extraordinary . The direction in the beginning is excellent . The tension works . And it's an entertaining , unusual movie - - it's not bad . It's just lukewarm . It's not as good as it thinks it is , and it's not as good as it should have been . Part of it is Cronenberg's fault , and part of it is the lead performance by Viggo Mortensen . He's TOO subdued - - there's a fine line between playing a tormented character and a one-note one . De Niro in " Once Upon a Time in America " did the same thing better . Other actors have , too . The script's bad , also . The teen subplot is unnecessary and ridiculous . Jocks aren't that stereotypical . Is it a Cronenberg film or a John Hughes one ? I bought it on DVD . I'm a Cronenberg fan . Maybe I'll watch it again with the rest of the commentary and try to re-evaluate it . ( I know that's necessary with some of Cronenberg's films . ) But this one failed to impress me on the same level as " Naked Lunch " or even " The Fly . "
430131	1173088	56869	6.0	" The Birds " has always been one of my lesser favorites from Hitchcock	I've been watching " The Birds " since I was too young to even remember , and when I was moving across countries once I even caught the sequel on television ( which is just gruesome and lacking the suspense of this ) . However " The Birds " has always seemed slightly uneven to me , as if the premise itself is so absurd that I have a hard time taking the film entirely seriously . In my opinion the best Hitchcock films are " North by Northwest , " " The 39 Steps , " " The Lady Vanishes , " " The Man Who Knew Too Much , " " Vertigo , " " Rear Window " and of course my favorite horror film of all-time , " Psycho . " " The Birds " is a good film and very well-made but because its content is so silly in nature you may find yourself having a hard time taking it all as seriously as Hitch expects us to . So overall , it is a fine movie , but not one of the Master of Suspense's greatest .
429405	1173088	160127	6.0	Delivers What it Promises . . .	" Charlie's Angels " has been taking a lot of heat for being stupid , ridiculous , immature , etc . . . and while it's definitely not a great film , I can't help but half-enjoy it . Cameron Diaz , Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu fill in the shoes of the Angels , from the hit TV show " Charlie's Angels " - - remember that show ? Well , in this film , the Angels must stop a madman from doing something bad somewhere in the world . I'm not really sure what the plot was , because there really is no plot per say . This film is an excuse for two of Hollywood's prettiest women ( Cameron Diaz & Drew Barrymore ) running around blowing stuff up in bikinis . I'd have to say that the only thing that keeps this movie from being a better piece of entertainment is the annoying ( and horrible actress ) Lucy Liu . According to IMDb . com and shows like " Entertainment Tonight " and " Access Hollywood , " Bill Murray ( who played Bosley in this film ) did not return for the upcoming sequel because he didn't like working with Liu . I can't say I blame him . Just the sight of her ugly face on screen makes me cringe . I remember an interview with Murray back on the set of the original film , and they asked him about alleged arguments with Lucy Liu on set . He said the accusations were false , but I could tell he was lying . But apart from her , the cast is quite ensemble . The hilarious Bill Murray keeps this film from becoming nothing more than a bikini advert , and the enjoyable Tim Curry helps Murray a lighten the mood a bit in one of the scenes . Sometimes the film uses very odd filming techniques , and " McG , " the director , seems to try and go too much for a modern look . But , in a way , it gives the film more of a summer-flick feeling than anything memorable , which is all I want " Charlie's Angels " to be . The person going into this expecting Oscar-material has a screw loose . This movie is a lot like the film " MI : 2 " ( " Mission : Impossible 2 " ) : it delivers a whole lot of action for a nice night in . It's a summer flick , and nothing more . Pure Entertainment . Maybe a bit whacky at times , but nevertheless entertaining and fun , regardless of some flaws . stars - John Ulmer
429497	1173088	85470	6.0	Rodney's fans will like it	This was really the first true Rodney Dangerfield vehicle . It was clearly written with Rodney in mind , or at least edited to fit him after he signed on . As a result , a lot of scenes go nowhere and seem completely random - they're just showcases for some of that famous Rodney Humor . If another actor were cast in the role , the movie would be terrible because the flaws would be outstanding . But when it's Rodney , it all seems to fall into place . The plot involves Rodney's mother-in-law dying and leaving him her fortunes in her will - but only if he cleans up his act first . He has to stop smoking , drinking , doing drugs , and must begin eating healthier . Of course , this can't hold up an entire movie , so the first 35 minutes or so has nothing to do with the rest of the plot . It shows Rodney at home , it shows him hanging out with Joe Pesci , gambling , going to a strip club , etc . Then there is a really bizarre subplot involving his daughter's wedding that contains one long , rambling scene ( without Rodney , surprisingly ) that goes nowhere . However , Rodney fans will find his typical humor here to enjoy . It may not be as coherent as " Back to School " but it is still a fine showcase for his comedic talents and reveals why Rodney Dangerfield was one of the best comedians of all-time , regardless of how bad the movies he starred in usually were .
430492	1173088	205000	6.0	Poor crude sexual humor with very sporadic laughs	Deuce Bigalow is a fish tank cleaner who agrees to stay at a European gigalow's house while he's away on business . However after he trashes the man's apartment he has only one option : to pose as the European and start selling his body for money so that he can pay for the damage done to the house . Rob Schneider would probably be nowhere without Sandler and it's a bit sad that they continually rely on each other with cameos , etc . in each of their films - here Sandler produces the film through his Happy Madison company and lends a brief voice cameo . However this movie really isn't funny and although I enjoy some of Schneider's work ( more so than most of Sandler's ) he's quite pathetic here and not very funny at all . He's much better as a co-star rather than a leading man , as proved with other projects such as " The Animal . " Schneider simply doesn't have the leading man qualities and that is stressed here - part of the film's failure is due to his lackluster ( albeit fairly likable and occasionally funny ) performance . The film's biggest flaw however is its stupid script and direction - it simply doesn't have very many jokes and is wacky in a bad way ( think : " The Hot Chick " meets " Master of Disguise " ) . The gags almost all rely upon sex , bodily fluids / sounds and / or other such crude innuendo for laughs - and it very rarely delivers any . There are a few funny segments but for the most part , all the funny stuff is on the trailer - which is never a good sign for a " comedy " . . .
431027	1173088	119695	6.0	Entertaining but hardly worthwhile	The only thing that can be said for " Money Talks " is that it held my interest . No , it's not a great film , but then again few comedies of this sort are . For what it is , the film entertained me enough to recommend it . Tucker and Sheen have rather good chemistry together , albeit it in a less-than-spectacular way . Essentially the plot is a bunch of nonsense , it's just an excuse to see another white man / black man buddy comedy in the vein of " Lethal Weapon , " " Running Scared , " etc . This is not a " good " movie but if it's on TV you might as well give it a go , it's hardly awful and certainly better than it could have turned out to be .
430171	1173088	119567	6.0	Read the book . . .	The first Jurassic Park was very good , as was the book , and while THE LOST WORLD novel isn't as good as the first , the film's even farther off . Jeff Goldblum's character has done a complete 180 degree turn into some " Know it all preacher . " I hate the scene where he says something like " Ooh , yeah , that's how it all starts-then there's screaming and yelling and running . " He sounds incredibly stupid when he's saying it , and his character in this film is just plain annoying . I love the first and third film , and despite the sickening rumors of Ian Malcolm coming back for film 4 , I hop that Grant ( Sam Neill ) comes back for more . I'm hoping unless the script is excellent , they don't make another stupid film to end the series like The Lost World . Let's hop for something like film 1 or 3 ( hearing rumors of film 5 too . I guess people love the dinos-I know I do ) . I give the Lost World stars for having some good dinosaur sequences-other than that it's a pass . JOHN ULMER
430565	1173088	106977	7.0	Run Harrison Run .	Imagine a time , if you will , when fugitive movies were not released ten times a year , a time when Tommy Lee Jones actually appeared in fugitive movies simply because he liked the script and not because he was revisiting the role that made him famous again , a time when the fugitive movies were about much more than simply a homicidal maniac being chased by a man who has a connection to him . You will understand this film a lot more . It relies so much on characters and a witty script as compared to explosions and fight scenes . But of course that's not to say it doesn't have any pyrotechnics or chase scenes or battles - the action scenes will satisfy even the biggest of action buffs . It just makes a lot more sense when they're there for a purpose . Harrison Ford plays Dr . Ryan Kimble . Kimble comes home from work one night after an emergency procedure at the hospital to find his wife brutally beaten to death by a one-armed man . The one-armed man escapes from the scene of the crime and all evidence points to Ryan as the assaultant and killer . After sentenced to death , Ryan is pushed into the back of a convict bus transporting convicted fellons to jail . But one of the criminals tries to escape and the bus ends up swerving off the road and flipping down a steep ravine , coming to rest upon a railroad track . Ryan escapes before the train rips through the bus , resulting in a great scene where Ryan is running in front of the derailed train , chained at his feet and arms . It's the classic Indiana Jones bolder scene redux . Ryan eventually disappears into the woods and U . S . Marshal Samuel Gerard ( Tommy Lee Jones ) arrives at the scene of the crash a short time later . He is the ultimate seeker ; he is barely ever wrong about anything , and when he is he doesn't like to admit it . Jones presents his character with such a sense of self-confidence and oozing calmness that his Oscar was well-deserved . Ryan keeps on running throughout the film , only stopping to gather evidence of his killer and then moving on . He goes through some interesting scenarios and starts to stumble upon a conspiracy , but no one will hear his story - the only living person who might care is the same man who says he doesn't care : Sam Gerard . If I am correct in my observations , Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones only appear in about two scenes together - the rest of the film they are apart from each other . As Jones pursues Ford , it seems as though he starts to make a connection with his prey - as though he may be the only one understanding what Ford is doing and why . It creates a sense of greater suspense for the audience . This is not a run-of-the-mill chase picture we are exploited to on so many occasions . We care for both characters in equal regards , and when they finally do come face-to-face it results in a kind of unexpected payoff ; at last we get to see the two together in the same shot and it's strangeThe movie is directed by Andrew Davis , who directed " Collateral Damage " and " Holes . " He has a solid sense of direction even if the material itself doesn't always hold together . Given a terrific script like " The Fugitive , " Davis creates a type of cement cornerstone that is the base of the film . The script and direction compliment themselves often , something that can't be said in most cases . Tommy Lee Jones recently appeared in " The Hunted , " a film about a madman killer on the loose , and Jones plays the man trying to pursue him . The stupidity of the script hit me hard . I rewatched " The Fugitive " not a week after I saw " The Hunted " and realized the sheer genius of it versus the lesser film . This is a movie that will wet the apetite of all action , mystery and thriller lovers alike who are looking for something different than the routine chase films . I know it did for me . stars - John Ulmer
429676	1173088	83000	7.0	Very likable Hitchcockian thriller from the director of " Psycho II " . . .	It's amazing how many pleasant treats you'll find on TV Friday nights at one o'clock in the morning . Take " Roadgames " ( or " Road Games " ) for example : The Hitchcockian story of a trucker delivering meat across Australia who becomes entangled in a possible mystery involving an unapprehensible serial killer who may or may not have murdered a helpless hitchhiker traveling the roads he's driving on . Often referred to as " Rear Window " on the road , self-proclaimed Hitchcock enthusiast Richard Franklin has directed a quaint , low-budget thriller with a likable ( although quite unusual ) lead actor in the role of Frustrated Hero . Pat Quid ( Stacy Keach - - who is indeed a man ) is driving across Australia in a meat truck when he thinks he's noticed a strange happening - - a man in a van seems to be burying a bag in the middle of a desert in Australia , and when he is noticed he climbs back into his blue van and speeds away into the distance . Pat puts this event into the back of his mind when he decides against regulations to pick up a wandering hitchhiker named Pam Rushworth ( Jamie Lee Curtis ) , who has run away from home in an effort to escape her famous father's life . The two bond together on the road and have some fun playing various games - - until she is kidnapped by the same strange man in a van . At first , Pat thinks he's just being paranoid - - he even starts to think that Pam left him for the man . But then he realizes that Pam has indeed been kidnapped , and he suspects that the strange man in the van might be a notorious serial killer who has been killing young women and scattering their body parts miles apart from each other . After the police offer no help , Pat takes matters into his own hands and sets off on a quest to bring back Pam to safety and apprehend the killer before he can strike again . Some twists and turns ensue , although nothing very surprising . If this were a mainstream horror film with an overblown budget and big-name actors , I'd probably give " Roadgames " a bad rating . But this is the type of pleasant , likable low-budget thriller that is easy to watch and knows it's nothing more than a shadow of greater film noir mysteries / thrillers like " Rear Window " or " The Third Man " - - the type of film that thrusts its hero on a one-man venture into the heart of darkness in order to find out the truth . Stacy Keach is strikingly likable as the lonely trucker who talks to his own pet dingo as he drives along , contemplating all types of conspiracy theories about serial killers and mysteries . What could definitely become tiring - - listening to a man talk to his dingo for the majority of a movie , that is - - actually becomes quite fun . Keach is funny , nice , and just . . . likable ! Too bad his career was put on hold years later after he got arrested for smuggling cocaine . . . The director , Richard Franklin , is a huge Hitchcock fan - - and it shows . This film is like a sort of remake of " Rear Window " and other such mystery-thrillers . It's loads of fun and an easy watch . ( Trivia note : Franklin directed " Psycho II , " the sequel to Hitchcock's 1960 classic original . ) I can definitely say that this film is most like " Breakdown , " the Jonathan Mostow movie starring Kurt Russell as a man who loses his wife to a trucker and tries to get her back , even though there seems to be no evidence of her disappearance . But unlike the great " Breakdown , " this film doesn't wither away in the second half and turn into a disappointing movie - - it remains strong throughout , and yes , it has plenty of nods towards Hitchcock . ( Check out the magazines Curtis starts sorting through - - there he is ! ) stars . - John Ulmer
429821	1173088	98273	7.0	An entertaining movie with a sloppy and insulting conclusion	This was Al Pacino's first box office success of the 1980s . In 1983 , " Scarface " came out and didn't do much business - the critics took a beating on it and Pacino's career suffered quite a deal throughout the decade - " Cruising , " " Revolution , " and " Author ! Author ! " didn't help much , either . " Sea of Love " transformed everything for him . It was a success financially and ( somewhat ) critically , and it helped him get more roles in the ' 90s . Looking back now , in 2005 , it still holds up as entertainment , and sleazy entertainment at that , but the ending is too routine , insulting and oh-so-typical of the genre ; it's the " trick ' em at the end " leg-puller where the murderer is revealed to be the most stupid of characters and you can't believe the film's ended on such a low note . The rest of it is actually pretty good . Pacino delivers an unusual performance as a socially and sexually awkward cop who meets a murder suspect ( Ellen Barkin ) and falls for her , only to realize she may be targeting him next . " Basic Instinct " got away with copying a lot of this a couple years later , but I prefer " Sea of Love . " It's erotic and sleazy and entertaining without resorting to cheap tactics like full-frontal nudity . Then again you do get to see Ellen Barkin naked and that's never a bad thing . The movie focuses on its characters , and I liked that . I just wish the ending would have been up to par with the rest of the production . It's an entertaining movie , but don't expect anything of substance .
430355	1173088	139809	7.0	Intriguing sci-fi drama that suffers in the last stretch . . .	Another " Are we who we think we are ? " 1999 sci-fi drama about computer matrixes that are host to our very humanity . Scientist Scott Bierko visits a computer simulation of the 1930s in order to unlock the secret of his mentor's murder . This leads to some rather startling revelations . Bierko is sorely miscast , but he fits into the entire 30s picture quite nicely . Vincent D'Onofrio turns in a good performance as two separate characters related to each other via the computer world . This is an intriguing premise that would have probably been a lot more popular if not for " The Matrix " preceding it by a few months ( if memory serves me right ) . In retrospect , it seems very similar , but it also seems to be coincidence . Too bad the ending was so . . . silly . stars - - the 1930s evocations are the best of the entire picture . - John Ulmer
430184	1173088	104257	7.0	Pretty good	Tom Cruise gives us one of his best performances , and isn't yet so full of himself , like he was in the recent film MINORITY REPORT . Demi Moore , ex-wife of Bruce Willis gives her definite best performance , though I feel they could've gotten someone better to play the character . Kevin Bacon delivers a force on screen , such as never before , and Kevin Pollack gives a definite best performance . Jack Nicholson , of whom is in the film not much , but enough not to be listed as a cameo , gives a pulse pounding performance , with those ever famous words , ' You Can't handle the Truth ! ' The director of A FEW GOOD MEN is Rob Reiner ( the Princess Bride ) , and he does a wonderful job directing this all star cast . He truly delivers just what we want as the screen moves on , as such he did with THE PRINCESS BRIDE . If you're looking for a solid , rock hard movie delivering some of the actors best performances , then I definitely recommend A FEW GOOD MEN to you !
430939	1173088	107614	7.0	Very funny at times	IMDb user Blake French writes , in regards to " Mrs . Doubtfire " : " ' Mrs . Doubtfire ' is one of the most invigorating , vivid character studies to be produced on the big screen this decade . Most of the characters are strongly executed with decisive dialogue . They are also beautifully written with tainted personalities and uncompromising wit . Chris Columbus has assembled a stellar dramatic comedy with excellent screen writing , giving audiences one of the most punctually artful films I have ever witnessed . " I don't really agree with this . I wouldn't quite call it a " punctually artful " film . There's nothing artful about a hairy guy stuffing a cake onto his face to make it look like an exfoliating cream . Or running around swapping clothes in a restaurant like a frantic ape . But this movie is funny . . . and for as slapstick as its humor is , it's also surprisingly human in nature , which is something Blake touched upon in his review . Robin Williams stars as Daniel , a guy whose wife ( Sally Field ) leaves him with their three kids after he misses his kid's birthday party . ( Ooh , talk about grounds for divorce ! ) Daniel loves his kids , though , so he dresses up as a woman with prosthetic effects and becomes their nanny under the false identity of an Irish ( ? ) housekeeper named Mrs . Doubtfire . Meanwhile Daniel's ex-wife begins dating a rich and suave English businessman ( Pierce Brosnan pre-James Bond ) and he becomes jealous , trying to ruin their relationship under the guise of Doubtfire . This movies is quite similar to the Dustin Hoff " classic " comedy " Tootsie " in terms of plotting . They're both quite funny and some of the only guy-in-drag films that are actually good . Williams is funny ( one of his last truly humorous performances ) and totally steals the spotlight from everyone else - including Brosnan . Chris Columbus ( " Home Alone " ) has a way of making over-the-top films while managing to restrain them to the elements of humanity , and that's the clearest thing about this film - what makes it funny and , ultimately , so likable , even when it's not cracking us up consistently .
430228	1173088	86190	7.0	Very good but inferior to the others	The third parts of trilogies tend to be inferior to their predecessors . This applies to " Alien , " " Back to the Future , " " The Matrix , " " Austin Powers , " " Lethal Weapon , " " Mad Max " and other film series . Then there are the few that come along - - such as " The Good , the Bad and the Ugly " - - that are actually the best of all three . Unfortunately " Star Wars : Episode VI - The Return of the Jedi " fits into the former category - - it is far inferior to its predecessors . I've always enjoyed " The Empire Strikes Back " the most of all three , and " Return of the Jedi " the least . It is arguably one of the earliest signs of things to come for writer George Lucas , who employs a band of child-friendly ( and marketable ) " Eewoks " to join Luke Skywalker on his quest against the Empire in this installment . After " Return of the Jedi , " Lucas never really got back on track , and particularly with the recent " Star Wars " prequels it is apparent he has sold out and lost grasp of how to make a good film . The Eewoks aren't very far off from Jar-Jar Binks . That's not to say " Return of the Jedi " is a bad film - - in fact it's very good . But we all remember , " May the force be with you " from " Star Wars , " and " I am your father ! " from " The Empire Strikes Back . " There's nothing particularly memorable here - - it is not one of the greatest films ever made , just a very satisfying ( if occasionally goofy ) conclusion to the trilogy . It is not as bad as " The Matrix Revolutions , " for sure . Han Solo ( Harrison Ford ) , now cryogenically frozen by Jabba the Hutt , is being held captive . Luke Skywalker ( Mark Hamill ) and Princess Leia ( Carrie Fisher ) both try to rescue Han , to no avail , and Luke - - now a Jedi - - ends up being thrown into the pit of a dangerous beast , which he defeats to the surprise of Jabba . Jabba then decides to have all of them murdered , but Luke and co . make a daring escape with the help of all his pals - - C-3PO , R2-D2 , Leia and Chewbacca - - and eventually end up on a faraway planet where they arrive under the car of the friendly Eewoks , who help them with their attack against The Empire's new and improved Death Star . Luke uncovers a startling secret about Leia , revisits the dying Yoda , and eventually comes face-to-face with Vader , where he is faced with a bit of a moral dilemma after the Emperor decides that Luke would be a worthy addition to their army . It's pointless divulging into the plot in-depth basically because everyone has already seen these movies . What can be discussed are the special effects , performances , and general plot of the film , as that is what most people will take from this film - - those looking for meaningful dialogue should look elsewhere . Released in 1983 , six years after the original , special effects had evolved even more - - with a larger budget to expand upon director Richard Marquand tops off both prior films in terms of SF / X . There's an exciting chase sequence , lots of hyper-speed battles , space ship exteriors and " lightsaber " fights - - enough to wet the appetite of anyone looking for mere action . Unfortunately what " Return of the Jedi " lacks is originality - - " Star Wars " was unique when it came out , recycling old storytelling clichés in a modern update ; the sequel was very dark and impressive with arguably the best performances of all three films ; the only thing to look for here is Luke's sudden evolution from Jedi trainee to Jedi master . Oh , and the final showdown , which is still impressive , even by today's efforts . All in all , " Return of the Jedi " is not on the same level as its predecessors but it is an exciting movie that manages to satisfyingly end the series on a high note . About those prequels . . . well , they're just unfortunate .
430911	1173088	114594	7.0	For anyone who's ever had a vindictive boss - or a job at all , for that matter	" Swimming with Sharks " was made right around the time Kevin Spacey was becoming a rising star - his name was becoming well known enough that he could help finance low budget movies . Along with " The Usual Suspects " he helped " Swimming with Sharks " get off the ground , and now ten years later ( it was given wide release in 1995 ) it still holds up well as a very , very dark comedy . In fact , comedy isn't the right word . This shouldn't really be classified as comedy . It's not that funny . It works better as a dark satire - I expected something like " War of the Roses , " but instead I got a Tarantino version of " Office Space " ( complete with torture , violence , revenge and mayhem ! ) . Frank Whaley stars as Guy , a typical nobody who dreams of being a somebody . ( Even his name confines him to anonymity . ) When he lands a job working for world-famous producer Buddy Ackerman ( Spacey ) , his future looks bright . . . until he realizes what he's in for . Spacey delivers the best performance of the film , yelling , screaming , and throwing hissy fits practically every time he's on screen . But he never pushes the limits . He's always believable as a self-absorbed , ego-maniacal , ruthless producer ; the director claims on the DVD commentary track and documentaries that he based the character and many scenes on actual things that happened to him while he worked for unnamed producers in Hollywood . Joel Silver is rumored to have been the basis for Ackerman . The movie isn't great and never really achieves the amount of laughs I wanted but if you view it as a very dark drama-comedy you're more likely to enjoy it . I still found myself quite entertained and taken aback by how daring and unique this movie actually is - no one can condemn it for resorting to clichés . The ending is a punch in the stomach , I never expected it . Whaley is good at playing the over / underwhelmed everyman and the direction is OK ( if just so ) . The best aspects are the witty script and Kevin Spacey's scene-stealing performance ; together he has good chemistry with Whaley and the movie succeeds based on the actors ' success in their roles .
431120	1173088	348333	7.0	Not great , but entertaining	I found " Waiting " to be better than most comedies of its kind , and although it is very much a wannabe " Clerks " it still comes across as being quite entertaining . Unfortunately parts of the film go on too long and the juvenile moments - such as the kitchen antics involving the flashing of male genitalia - become stale very fast . Ryan Reynolds plays a smug waiter at a restaurant called Shenanigans where he finds himself with a wide array of co-workers , including Anna Faris of " Scary Movie " fame . Ultimately the movie chronicles a day in the lives of these people and what a pain the profession ( if you can even call it that ) can be . This movie is based on the writer / director's personal experiences as a waiter earlier in his life , and most of it really does happen to some degree . I always remember what a cook at a restaurant told me once - if you saw the kitchen in any place you'd never want to eat out again . The movie has fun with some restaurant in-jokes such as the " five-second rule " of dropping food on the floor and so on and so forth . I thought Reynolds was quite good but the dramatic arc of the story involving a waiter and his decision of whether to leave the job gets tiring . " Clerks " handled the drama better , and even " Clerks " wasn't a perfect comedy . I found most of the better moments to come from the supporting cast - despite his repetitive exposure scenes , Luis Guzman was still hilarious in his role as one of the chefs . Overall , I found this to be entertaining and more than what I expected - but it never quite achieves its full potential , either . If you've ever worked at a restaurant of any kind then you're likely to get some kicks out of this - but don't expect another " Clerks . "
429968	1173088	840884	8.0	A fitting closure to Season Two	Season finales - especially those for comedies - are often cursed with having to tie up loose ends in the narrative , resulting in a noticeable shift in humor . However , although not quite as outrageously funny as some of the earlier episodes in the season , " Dennis and Dee Get a New Dad " was a lot funnier than I had expected . It manages to come full circle while still providing plenty of laughs , and it even provides an amusing twist at the end that I never saw coming . The plot is a return to the more complex - after some rather straightforward episodes , this one is all over the map . It begins with Dee finding a man on MySpace . com who claims to be her real father . So Dee and Dennis ask their mother whether there's any truth to this - and she confirms that the man is being honest . This causes Frank , who thought Dee and Dennis were his children , to question his entire life . He is so upset that he has a minor stroke and ends up swearing to seek revenge against the biological father of Dee and Dennis . Meanwhile , Dennis and Dee meet up with their real father , who is played by Stephen Collins in a nice send-up of the role he is famous for in " 7th Heaven . " Dennis and Dee love their new father for a while , but soon his incredibly clean image and " nice guy " vibe starts to get on their nerves . And in the meantime , Mac and Charlie are lured into running heroin for Mac's father , who has been in jail for Mac's entire life . But before they can do this , they have to prove they are tough , so they tell Frank that they will beat up Dennis and Dee's father to earn themselves " street cred . " The twist at the end is hilarious and a classic example of this show's sick sense of humor . To be honest I thought Charlie and Mac were kind of pushed aside for much of the duration of the episode , and usually the show is better at balancing multiple story lines , but in this case I think they just had a hard time fitting so much plot into one episode . Perhaps F / X should have granted them a one-hour time slot for the finale - the Charlie / Mac subplot could have been expanded a bit more , because I thought it was hilarious and this was the first time I really felt as if they didn't spend enough time on Charlie - who is usually a main character in every episode . Regardless , considering they only had about 24 minutes the " Sunny " gang really did pull off an excellent finale here - it was funny , clever , brutal and entertaining . It leaves you hanging with its open ending , and I honestly can't wait for Season Three to begin .
430773	1173088	405422	8.0	A very pleasant surprise - the best " sex " comedy in years .	The key to The 40-Year-Old Virgin is not merely that Andy Stitzer is a 40-year-old virgin , but rather the manner in which Steve Carell presents him as one . In a genre of crass " comedy " that has become typified by its lack of humor and engaging characters , The 40-Year-Old Virgin offers a colorful cast and an intelligent , heartfelt script that doesn't use its protagonist as the butt-end of cruel jokes . That Andy is still a virgin at forty years old is not as much a joke , in fact , as it is a curiosity . Carell , a veteran of Team Ferrell in Anchorman and an ex-Daily Show castmember , uses the concept of the film to expand his character ? we get to understand why Andy is the way he is . It's the little things that make this film work . When Andy's co-worker at an electronics store asks him what he did for the weekend , Andy describes his failed efforts at cooking . When Andy rides his bike to work , he signals his turns . He doesn't just adorn his home with action figures ? he paints them , and talks to them , and reveals that some of the really old ones have belonged to him since childhood . A lesser comedy wouldn't even begin to focus on all of these things . The plot is fairly simplistic ? Andy's co-worker pals find out he's never had sex and they make it a personal quest of theirs to get him in bed with a woman . It's a childish idea and the film makes no attempt to conceal its juvenility . Andy's friends are a complement to his neurotic nature : David ( Paul Rudd ) has broken up with his girlfriend over two years ago but is still obsessed with her , Jay ( Romany Malco ) is a womanizing ladies ' man and Cal ( Seth Rogen ) is a tattooed sexaholic . Their attempts at getting Andy in the sack backfire numerous times , and each time leaves Andy feeling less and less optimistic . Finally Andy meets single mom Trish ( played by Catherine Keener ) and , much to the chagrin of his worrying buddies who claim mothers aren't worth it , he falls in love with her . They begin a relationship and agree to put off having sex for twenty days ? Trish being unaware that Andy is still a virgin . The 40-Year-Old Virgin was directed by Judd Apatow , the man who produced Anchorman and The Cable Guy , and began the short-lived cult TV show Freaks and Geeks . Apatow is renowned for his unique sense of humor , and the script ? co-written by Carell ? offers plenty . However , in the end the most interesting and ( indeed surprising ) aspect of The 40-Year-Old Virgin is its maturity . By now you are probably well aware that the film received glowing reviews from the critics , and even I was surprised by its warm reception . But after seeing the film , it's easy to understand why . We like Andy . We care about him . He's not just some cardboard cutout sex-comedy cliché ? he's a real , living , breathing person . His neurotic traits combine the best of Woody Allen with childish naivety . His friends are not unlikable jerks and his romance is tumultuous and bittersweet . It strikes a chord with the audience . Although this is far from being a perfect movie and definitely contains some rather crude innuendo and sexual humor , it doesn't offend to the extent that other genre entries might have because we have affection for the people on-screen . The best sex comedies work this way ? from Risky Business to American Pie ? and that is the major difference between something like The 40-Year-Old Virgin and 40 Days and 40 Nights .
430801	1173088	116365	8.0	Very entertaining with just the right blend of comedy and horror !	THE FRIGHTENERS has just the right blend of comedy and horror , and will please most audiences . Director Peter Jackson did a great job directing this film , and Michael J . Fox gives one of his most unusual performances as a " ghost buster " who has a rare gift that allows him to see the dead . All in all , a unique film that is very different from its competition in the horror drama and really only falls apart towards the end , when it resorts to the typical slasher ending with plot twists . Apart from the end , it's sure to keep you entertained throughout ! stars JOHN ULMER
429615	1173088	120586	8.0	Not a perfect film , but very good - Norton's performance is the highlight	" American History X " is a bold and disturbing movie about family , racism and our own self-perceptions . Its main character is Derek ( Edward Norton ) , a neo-Nazi skinhead who is released from jail to find his younger brother ( Edward Furlong ) descending down the same corrupt path as he once walked . In jail Derek learns a few things about life , and racism , or more appropriately , himself , and after becoming a free man again takes it upon himself to set his brother on the straight and narrow path . " American History X " is not a pleasant motion picture . It begins in flashback , as Derek murders two black kids trying to break into his car . His brother , who idolizes Derek and later mimics his lifestyle , witnesses this event . It's a good message about negative influences , along with everything else . Much has been made of the film's controversy and lawsuits . Director Tony Kaye disowned the film after Norton ( allegedly ) re-edited footage to give himself more screen time . Kaye tried to have his name changed on the film credits , but by this time he had already taken out a complaint in several magazines , which are against the rules of the Director's Guild . He was therefore denied the opportunity to credit the work as " directed by Humpty Dumpty . " Then , musical band Anti-Hero complained to New Line Cinema ( the film's international distributor ) because one of the Nazi characters featured a tattoo of their band . They later wrote a song , called " NLC , " bashing the company . Despite the hard-edged controversy it's still a very good film , above all else extremely well-acted and featuring a gripping storyline ? even if the direction isn't always up to par . Edward Norton is simply superb in his role , showing extremely raw talent a mere two years after his film debut ( in the Richard Gere thriller " A Primal Fear " ) . Norton careens between the role of a raging , vicious supremacist and a kindler , gentler version of the same character ; a metamorphosis so convincing it's hard to believe it's just one actor . The rest of the cast is good as well ? Furlong gives the best performance of his career and Beverly D'Angelo and Stacy Keach have strong supporting roles . ( D'Angelo in particular , who portrays a sleazy alcoholic ? a stretch compared to her usual Normal Mom roles in the " Vacation " movies . ) " American History X " isn't exactly rewarding of all the praise it has been lavished since its release ( mainly from viewers rather than critics , who were less kind ) ? it isn't the best movie of its kind or even a flawless one . The black-and-white photography isn't on the same level , visually , as " Raging Bull " or " Schindler's List . " The preaching is a bit heavy-handed at times . But it still manages to convey an important lesson and boasts great acting complimented by an ( overall ) impressive , gut-wrenching screenplay . A must-see for all who can stomach its content .
430053	1173088	410336	8.0	If you like the Crue , you'll like this	Motley Crue is a great hair metal band . I specify " hair metal " because as a regular rock band they're crap . Hair metal is a different style of music altogether and graded as such , the Crue are one of the all-time best . They've got the image , the sound , and the lyrics . The videos are another thing . Some of the ' 80s videos like " Home Sweet Home " were ridiculously cheesy but good fun . ( The opening with Nikki , Tommy , Vince and Mick answering their phones is just plain silly and looks like something from " Bill and Ted " or " Fast Times at Ridgemont High " . ) Later on they got a bit darker . " Girls , Girls , Girls " ( their best song tied with " Dr . Feelgood " ) follows the Crue as they ride their motorcycles to a strip club and watch babes strip down . The uncensored version includes nudity . " Dr . Feelgood " is a music video about a drug dealer and it's a bit reminiscent of " Scarface " starring Al Pacino . I didn't like it too much because I thought the bits with Vince singing were quite cheesy and annoying . The Crue have changed a lot over the years - image-wise and musically - and this presents all their stuff from ' 81 - 2000 . If you're a fan of the Crue or just getting into them now , it's a good place to start - along with the new " Red White & Crue " greatest hits compilation , which rocks .
430332	1173088	454661	8.0	Fun , underrated music video ( s )	This is included on the excellent AC / DC " Family Jewels " DVD collection . It was originally circulated on VHS but went out of print quite a few years back - - the Family Jewels is a great way for fans to relive this video , as well as many others , that have long since stopped appearing on television and video . " Fly on the Wall " was a 1986 AC / DC album that didn't make much of a fuss when it came out . The videos from that album take place in a small bar ( reminded me of the one in " Blues Brothers " ) wherein the videos themselves are placed between brief segments ( mostly humorous ) . It opens with two bouncers kicking out a paparazzi photographer , which causes a sleeping animated fly to awaken from his rest . Inside the bar , AC / DC begins to play the song " Fly on the Wall , " which is intercut with segments of the fly itself buzzing around . This type of back-and-forth segment-intercutting is done throughout the 26-minute video . It's quite odd and unique and I found it entertaining . A must-see for casual fans , a must-own for AC / DC fans ( I'm somewhere in between , myself - and I appreciated it very much ) .
430702	1173088	37547	8.0	Another entertaining Cagney adventure !	Cagney stars as Nick , a newspaper reporter who travels to Japan . Once there the dastardly Japs ( remember , this was during WWII , all Japs were evil back then ) decide to interrogate him for information and so on and so forth . He doesn't cooperate . He puts up a fight , acquires a love interest , and so on and so forth . The plot is kind of typical - just so happens to be a spare attractive female lying around for him to pick up along the way , for example - but Cagney makes it work . This isn't on the same level as " Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye " or " White Heat " but it's still , for what it is , an entertaining adventure story with Cagney in fine form . Worth seeing if you're a fan of the actor , otherwise , you might wanna give it a miss .
431125	1173088	416315	8.0	A well-crafted horror film with character development before the chaos strikes	I had no interest in seeing " Wolf Creek . " When it came out , I recall seeing ads plastered all over the Internet with typically fan-boish praise from horror film circles and none other than Quentin Tarantino . It was also allegedly based on " true events " that weren't true at all , just - in the director's own words - " taken from a lot of different things . " It seemed to be another " Blair Witch " copycat and my interest was dead before I even gave the film a chance . It didn't help much that a critically-reviled film called " Cry _ Wolf " came out around the same time , starring Bon Jovi of all people , which made separation between the two serial killer horror films kind of hard . However , I recently gave " Wolf Creek " a chance on video and must say that I was very surprised by how well-made it is . I've never liked the original " Texas Chainsaw Massacre " film - - I understand why it is considered a classic of its genre and why it has such a strong reputation , but judged as a regular horror film and not altogether excusing it for its low budget , I think the set-up is terrible - stereotypical characters , awful dialogue , etc . It's generally unbelievable and they're all walking corpses-to-be . However , " Wolf Creek " spends a good 45 minutes or so setting up the three ( ! ) main characters of the film . That's right , only three . I was delighted to find a horror film with characters that seemed real - and likable ! I was blown away . When the villain is finally introduced , it's done subtly and creepily , and you never really know what's going to happen next - and that is throughout the film . It has a lot of sly twists , some of which aren't that shocking , and a lot of which are - mainly how the film toys with a lot of horror genre clichés and decides to kill off its characters or do similar things in the most odd places . The film has a supernatural edge and the bad guy seems like he's not entirely human . It reminded me of that film " The Hitcher " starring Rutger Hauer , and has a similar chase scene on a highway , only in my opinion " Wolf Creek " is a lot better . The villain's motives in " The Hitcher " were vague ( perhaps even non-existent ) , whereas in " Wolf Creek " we know he just kills out of sick sexual pleasure . Roger Ebert gave this movie zero stars in his review and basically called it pornographic trash . Well , whatever . He liked " The Devil's Rejects , " which - if you ask me - glorifies violence a lot more than this . " Wolf Creek " is exploitative and gory , but it creates a fear of the blood in a way not many slasher flicks do . We cringe when the character slices off the heroine's fingers because she seems like a real person , and that's a real shock . So , yeah - I can see where some of the criticism is coming from in regards to the movie being extreme in terms of violence - but in my opinion , unlike a lot of other horror films , it uses its enormous amount of blood n ' guts to prove a point rather than simply to shock . It works well , creating a moody atmosphere that - while not the " best horror film ever made " that Quentin Tarantino would like you to believe it is - is a lot better than most of the garbage out there in its genre . I found this to be clever , smart , well-made , and thoroughly entertaining . Probably one of the better horror films I've seen so far this decade .
429409	1173088	94142	8.0	" Strangers on a Train " Meets " The War of the Roses " . . .	" Throw Momma From the Train " is a simple dark comedy with lots of laughs . Billy Crystal plays a frustrated writer on the verge of collapse ; Danny DeVito plays a man in one of Crystal's writing classes . Crystal's ex-wife is a hag to put it nicely , and Crystal hates her . DeVito , sensing this , offers Crystal a deal one night : DeVito will kill Crystal's wife , if Crystal kills DeVito's nag of a mother . Crystal does , of course , refuse , but later , corruption deep in his heart makes him say yes . And so as things play out we see what happens when you try to throw someone's momma from a moving train . This story is an interesting character study ; a story of evil , greed , revenge , ego , trust , doing what's right , but most of all corruption . We see Crystal's white-collar writer become ever-stressed with events colliding around him , and because of DeVito's constant nagging , he says " yes . " But we know deep down in his subconscious he wanted to say " yes , " and he's pleased that he said it to DeVito . This movie is a bit of a dark spoof on Hitchcock's immortal film " Strangers on a Train , " and it plays an homage to the film early on , when there is a theater playing " Strangers on a Train . " We see DeVito watching the movie , and a lightbulb in his head pops on . He gets an idea . Throw Momma from the train ! Billy Crystal gives another convincing and strangely comical performance as a hassled writer on the verge of collapse . He has been so beaten down by everything around him that his inner-emotions come out and he agrees to throw DeVito's momma from the train . Danny DeVito directed this film excellently . He uses just the right touch of comic darkness to create a world of corruption and sickness . Everything is demented , but not to an extreme like in some other dark comedies . It has just the right touch of darkness that shone through in " The War of the Roses . " Not only is " Throw Momma From the Train " a simple tale of corruption and morality , but is also an interesting character study . Definitely worth catching on TV . stars - John Ulmer
429543	1173088	432348	8.0	The rare sequel that is intelligent AND in many ways better than its predecessor	I saw the original " Saw " when it came out in UK theaters back in 2004 . I thought it was very good - thrilling , different and clever . The acting was pretty bad ( especially the ending with Elwes ' laughable facial contortions ) , but it was the jolt that horror sorely needed . It wasn't another slice-'em-dice'-em slasher flick - it was smarter . When I read that they were almost instantly putting " Saw II " into production based on the success of the original - and that pretty much no one from the original film was returning except for Tobin Bell ( who plays Jigsaw ) - I had very small hopes . I even said on the message board for the film at one point that it was going to ruin the impact of the original . Well , I was wrong . In many ways , " Saw II " is better than the original . The acting talents are far stronger - - Donnie Wahlberg ( Marky Mark's brother ) is so much better than Elwes was in the first film . Due credit to Elwes - - he's a fine actor usually , but in " Saw " he was embarrassing towards the end . Wahlberg is perfect for the film . Another nice twist in the plot is that it isn't totally repetitive as the trailers would lead you to believe . It does something I've never seen before - the killer is arrested within the first twenty minutes AND unmasked . Tobin Bell is on-screen throughout the entire film in plain view , having discussions with Wahlberg . The movie implements a lot of new twists such as the whole concept of " Rashomon " ing everything and going back and forth between different perspectives . The ending is brilliant because it's not just a throwaway shocker - it has a moral message that I never expected from this film . The movie's interweaving plots and self-referential layers ( such as a revisiting of the bathroom from the first movie ) provide lots of fun and Jigsaw's game with the detective in the film is thought-provoking - this film is so much smarter and better than I ever expected and I was really blown away by the fact that we still have the capability of making good sequels to good movies that offer something fresh , rather than simply retreading material from the original .
430139	1173088	362270	8.0	Falsely marketed as a silly comedy when it is in fact a witty drama	In recent times , Bill Murray's movies have been misleadingly advertised . Fearing box office failure , the marketing team behind " Lost in Translation " crafted ads presenting it as a goofy romantic comedy . It was in fact a much deeper and poignant art house experience , and even after the Oscars ceremony there were still people renting the film expecting a comedy . It was a " critical success and a public disaster , " as one reviewer aptly described it . After all , no one pays to go see a serious Bill Murray movie , right ? Similarly , Wes Anderson's " The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou " seems to have misled many filmgoers into perceiving it is a silly slapstick comedy . It is not . Like Anderson's earlier work ( and in fact more so than anything else he has made ) , " The Life Aquatic " is a rather serious film with a bit of dry humor here and there to lighten the mood . Those expecting " Ghostbusters III " or another " Stripes " will be very disappointed . For my money this is Anderson's most mature directorial effort to date . It deals with a lot of angst and could arguably be called a mid-life-crisis movie ( although certainly less so than " The Royal Tenenbaums " ) . It deals with a man's trials and tribulations - ? involving death , love , hatred , regret , fatherhood , envy , and so on and so forth . There is not a more ideal actor out there to play this role than Bill Murray . In an interview , he once said that he has a lot of trouble and anger in his personal life ; it translates well to the screen . In " The Life Aquatic " Murray plays the titular Steve Zissou ( pronounced " Ziz-so " ) , world famous oceanographer and failing documentary film maker ( whose last hit , we are told , was nine years ago ) . While on a routine diving mission , Steve's lifelong friend is eaten alive by an unidentified " Jaguar Shark . " Steve captures the events on camera and inserts them in his next film , but the critical reaction is dire . Steve is accused of having lost his touch , and is given one last chance to present his investors a hit , or he will never work again . However the last things on Steve's mind are financial issues ? instead he swears revenge on the Jaguar Shark ( in the name of science , of course ) and embarks on an adventure to slaughter the fish that killed his best friend . Steve's estranged wife ( Anjelica Huston ) joins him on his trip , as well as a mysterious man who may or may not be Steve's son ( Owen Wilson with a Kentucky accent ) , and a very German Willem Dafoe ( who is responsible for most of the film's laughs ) . Also along for Zissou's final outing is a blunt reporter ( Cate Blanchett ) seeking the dirt on Zissou , who finds herself falling in love with his ostensible son . This movie is very ambiguous and open-ended . It leaves a lot open for discussion at the end - - something I believe Wes Anderson is particularly good at . Some of his past films such as " Rushmore " have been impressive , but it seems if Anderson has any flaws it is his unabashed sentimentality and ( as some critics have accused him of ) superficiality . Ironically " The Life Aquatic " is simultaneously Anderson's most superficial and honest film . On its surface , it is Anderson's first true Hollywood movie and even features special effects . But in terms of narrative it is by far his most realistic and touching movie ( or at least I thought so ) . Watching " Rushmore " I laughed a lot and felt attached to the characters , but the ending seemed tacked-on and didn't ring true . " The Life Aquatic " was entertaining and also managed to feel free of narrative manipulation ? and that is probably why people either love or hate it , judging from critical response . Overall , while not a flawless film , it is a very mature work , and a nice addition to Anderson's oeuvre . I believe its mixed reaction from the critics and public is due to the fact that it was heavily misunderstood on release ( as some of the great classic films were in their time ) and is , as I mentioned above , much more of an honest drama than some the audience probably expected it to be walking into the theater based on the promotional campaign and trailer . You can now experience the film unencumbered with erroneous preconceptions , and thanks to an excellent Two-Disc Criterion Collection DVD , there are ample special features available that may add to your appreciation of this excellent film .

429559	1173088	67309	8.0	A very good suspense-thriller with Fonda in top form	" Klute " is about a detective ( Donald Sutherland ) searching for a missing man , and his single lead points towards a prostitute named Bree ( Jane Fonda ) , who had been the missing man's mistress . However shortly after contacting her seeking information on the man , the detective Klute realizes someone is trying to kill Bree to silence her - so they flee together and try to uncover a web of lies and deception leading to the answer . " Klute " is one of those films you always hear about but never really watch . It's rarely on TV and seems to have more of a reputation than a following . However I was surprised that it really is a good film and lives up to its status as a " classic . " It's not one of the great , great films of the 1970s , but it is one of the better ones . Fonda as the prostitute Bree is an absolute stand-out and delivers the finest performance of her career . Sutherland is equally good as the detective , but Fonda steals the show . Director Alan J . Pakula has made a lot of great films and this is one of his best .
430402	1173088	67372	8.0	Stirring and violent retelling of a classic Shakespeare story	" The Tragedy of Macbeth " ( simply abbreviated " Macbeth " on most video covers ) is a violent retelling of Shakespeare's classic story . Macbeth ( Jon Finch ) , the Scottish Thane of Glamis , conspires with his wife Lady Macbeth ( and three strange witches ) to kill the widely-respected King Duncan . After committing the awful deed , Macbeth begins hallucinating , hearing strange omens of death and haunting words ; his wife similarly becomes worried with Macbeth's bloodlust , and Duncan's son convinces himself that Macbeth was involved in some way with the killing . " Macbeth " is a true tragedy , and chances are you already know a great deal about it as it seems to be a high school requirement that it be read by all students . The remarkable thing about Roman Polanski's movie is that it is not only a painfully accurate retelling of William Shakespeare's story , but doesn't flinch when it comes to violence . According to IMDb's trivia section ( and I can't honestly say how reliable this information is , mind you ) , Polanski included very violent scenes ( such as Duncan's death , which is NOT detailed in the original text ) because the movie was filmed around the same time period of Sharon Tate's brutal murder , and it was Polanski's way of venting stress and anger . One must imagine what happens to Duncan in this film is what Polanski wanted to do to the Manson family members ( and you certainly can't blame him ) . As such , knowing the circumstances of what brought about the violence , it is more forgivable and certainly maintains a haunting element - some kind of historical relic , just in knowing that it was filmed during such a terrible time in Polanski's life . The movie as a whole is wonderful . As I mentioned above , its accuracy ( in comparison to Shakespeare's text ) is spot-on - - entire scenes of dialogue are taken directly from the source , and even the strong violence lends the film a more realistic nature . Overall , it's an epic and ( sadly ) somewhat forgotten Shakespeare epic . If you enjoyed " Hamlet " or " Romeo and Juliet " ( the ' 60s version ) you'll certainly find this engaging , and - at times - rather shocking , too .
429684	1173088	325638	8.0	Very unexpected	A lowly woman gets on a French subway and is traveling in silence when a man suddenly appears and announces that he is in search of a woman as he hasn't been in love for over two years and is tired of feeling empty . People laugh and scoff at the man but he ignores them , and asks any woman who is interested to get off at the next bus stop . Well , the bus stops , the woman gleefully gets off , turns around - only to realize the man on the bus was doing it solely for entertainment , to gain money from travelers . The film ends with her standing on the platform , alone . I was taken aback by the suddenness of the ending . It's pretty powerful , especially considering it's only four minutes long . But the director manages to convey a lot of things just through facial expressions , particularly the woman's . Pretty brutal little film , but a very good one .
429768	1173088	91369	9.0	Very good fantasy film . Very much under rated !	The problem LABYRINTH had was the timing in which it opened . People just weren't into fantasy as much back then . I guarantee if this film had been released this or last year , it would've been a big hit . Films like Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings did so well , that people would have been open to accept other fantasy films like LABYRINTH . LABYRINTH has loveable and very creative characters , good acting ( Jennifer Connelly has now won an oscar for A Beautiful Mind BTW ) , very original looks to it , and is just plain filled with imagination and fun . Kudos to George Lucas and Jim Henson productions for this aspect of the film . LABYRINTH is worth every cent of the price , and I highly recommend it to you if you liked the other fantasy movies out this past year . stars . JOHN ULMER
430028	1173088	38975	9.0	A beautiful film	" The Spiral Staircase " starts off with an afflicted woman being murdered , and right from the onset I was surprised at how explicit it was for its time - by today's standards it's nothing you don't see every day on television , but 1946 was a very different time . It then moves onwards and we are introduced to a young woman who is mute and lives in a mansion with a long , spiraling staircase . ( Hint : this pays off later in the movie . ) When it's made known that a killer is making his rounds murdering afflicted women , the owner of the mansion fears for the mute woman's life - and after a string of more murders occur they realize she's next . RKO's picture was far ahead of its time . Someone on here said it's not a film noir and commanded that people stop calling it one . I'll disagree . I think it IS film noir , in the sense that it's a personal struggle for one person who's surrounded by death and murder . I don't think it should be left up to one person to decide what " film noir " really means . I do think there are limits of course ( " Batman Returns " is NOT film noir , it just tries to come across as one ) but no one should say , " This isn't a film noir because it's a thriller . " So what ? Loads of film noirs are thrillers . I personally feel the stylings , the themes and the motif of the movie could be classified as " film noir . " It's a beautiful movie to look at , very well filmed , and the ending is probably one of the best I can remember ever seeing . It's had a few remakes over the years , but the first remains the best - by a long shot . Highly recommended .
430169	1173088	332379	9.0	This " School " Rocks . . .	It was just a matter of time until a film like this came along . A slacker decides to transform a bunch of repressed children into well-educated young adults . Wait a minute , what am I saying ? Films like this have come along many times before - - " The Dead Poets Society , " " Mr . Holland's Opus , " " Hardball , " and " The Emperor's Club , " and that's only naming a few titles of many . But here's a movie so different from the rest it deserves some type of attention . Gone are the clean morals of , say , " Mr . Holland's Opus " - - here come lines like , " Stick it to the man ! " with a trailer that advertises , " . . . a man who taught them to break the rules . " These rules , by the way , are applied and kept in order by a private elementary school , where Dewey Finn ( Jack Black ) is posing as a teacher in order to get some cash to put together his own rock band . " ' The Man ' is everywhere , " he preaches to a small group of children . " You've gotta stick it to him . " So they stick it to " The Man " by forming a rock band during school hours and entering into the Battle of the Bands - - in hope that they'll win the jackpot reward for first place . I need to start at the beginning . Dewey Finn is a slacker loser who plays guitar like a pro - - the only problem is that he gets stoned when he and his band are performing and embarrasses his fellow players . After they kick him out prior to preparing for the upcoming Battle of the Bands , Dewey decides to form together his own band by getting some money . But how ? Dewey's roommate Ned Schneebly ( Mike White , who also wrote the film and a song in it ) is a substitute teacher ( " Not a temp ! " ) , and so when the phone rings and the call is for Ned , Dewey decides to pose as his best friend in hopes of getting some quick cash . He soon finds himself at " the best school in the state , " teaching a class of strange kids and trying to avoid getting found out by the principal ( Joan Cusack ) . A school dropout himself , Dewey only knows one thing : Music . So he teaches music to the kids after finding out they can play various instruments - - piano , guitar , drums , and even the cello ( which he decides to leave out of the forming band ) . Dewey decides to enter his " School of Rock " into the Battle of the Bands , much to the laughter of other competing bands . But he has true faith in his pack of school kids . That's part of what makes the film so inspirational and different from the other junk adorning the market right now - - this seems real , and so does the affection , and Jack Black turns Dewey Finn into a likable character - - the opposite of what someone like Adam Sandler might have done with the kids . ( I can see him in the role , but the film would undoubtedly have been a bit less of a serious comedy - - it would've turned into a loud , noisy , sporadically amusing comedy . ) The movie uses a lot of old cliches , but they all come off as - - at the very least - - acceptable , given the material . This is a refreshingly refreshing comedy , the type of film that makes you feel good after leaving the theater - - which is a very rare thing these days . The final Battle of the Bands is both realistic and uplifting . Even the end credits are fun to sit through . The film completely relies upon Jack Black as its carrier , and lucky enough for the film he is a very good lead . This is the film lover's version of a Rob Schneider or Chris Farley . Black has been around for a long time , always playing good co-star roles , and in " High Fidelity " he proved that he was more in-tune with the present times than any other recent " SNL " comedian . Not that Adam Sandler is bad given the right material , but how many times do we have to put up with re-makes of " Happy Gilmore " ? Black is arguably one of the funniest fat comedians since John Candy , when given the appropriate material . He's the type of comedian who could become quite annoying very quickly , but with the right material and director focusing behind the camera he turns out to be funnier than most guys out there . Black's ability to pick increasingly good scripts is something John Candy never seemed to be able to master ; although I think it was basically because Hollywood didn't want Candy to get good scripts . Once and a long time there comes the surprise hit wonder . Nobody ever thought that " School of Rock , " a movie starring Jack Black as a slob rock guitarist , would ever amount to anything . But it turned out to be one of the most critically-praised films of the year , and after seeing it for myself , I have to agree that this is a well-made film that has certainly been done before , but rarely this good , and even rarer is the formula ever this likable . stars . - John Ulmer
429544	1173088	77928	9.0	A harrowing and powerful film	Loosely based on the true story of Billy Hayes ( collected from his book of the same title ) , Alan Parker's " Midnight Express " contains some of the most effective and rightly iconic scenes in all of film history - - the opening with the heartbeats devoid of any soundtrack ; the " Oh Billy ! " segment ; and of course the entire idea of Turkish prisons being terrible and abusive . Hayes ' story was elaborative to begin with and Oliver Stone - - not exactly one to be known for sticking close to the truth - - exaggerates it even more ; so far , indeed , that it almost becomes fictional . The real Hayes had no girlfriend , was not raped in jail , DID have a homosexual relationship with another inmate ( the film shows him denying the advances ) , and escaped at night by sea . However , as a film this is probably one of the great motion pictures of the 1970s . Parker ( " Angel Heart " ) is a brilliant visual director and uses much of the same imagery he would use later on in his career . For example , take note of the fans in the sweltering heat inside the courtroom . They'd be used again in " Angel Heart . " Brad Davis gives a wonderful performance and convincingly devolves from a naive American student to a crazy lunatic by the time he enters the insane asylum . John Hurt's performance was also worthy of its Oscar nomination . Overall , this is very much a product of its time - - it's depressing , bleak , and almost painful to watch ; and because it's a Stone screenplay , there's a lot of politics at play . However , the overall film is breathtaking , thrilling and unpredictable ( to a point ) - - it's definitely worth seeing at least once in your lifetime .
429843	1173088	284592	9.0	A stunningly realistic action game	Forget all the other games you've played , because this , is a real game . A game that puts you in a war to dominate above all other players . A game , to let you win trophys . A game , for winners . This Computer realistic action game reminds me of the game " aliens versus predator " , it's stunningly realistic , and you can almost taste victory when you're playing . The graphics are wonderful , in one particular level you are in space , and the earth rotates before you , and it's so real looking it's hard to explain . The plot of the game is , in the somewhat near future , violence has become illegal , but to provide the same excitement of fighting for people , the government provides a game show , where there are teams of players who compete in enclosed surroundings , to kill everyone and be the last player . There are different modes of play , one is deathmatch ( kill everyone and be the last standing ) Capture the flag ( basic capture the flag game ) and some more like that . It reminds me of the movie " Running Man " with Arnold Schwarzenegger , and I have enjoyed this game so far , very much . Give it a try , and I promise you won't be let down . stars ( )
429736	1173088	53221	9.0	A classic with a few minor flaws .	Yep , all you " Pulp Fiction " junkies can rush out to the DVD stores - this is one of Quentin Tarantino's " top three " favorite films , along with " Taxi Driver " and " Blow Out . " Slightly irreverent top favorites , I'd say , except for " Driver . " This was basically loosely remade by John Carpenter in 1976 with ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 , which was much faster-moving and an excellent film , but this one is also rather terrific , if slower . ( Which , in this case , is a good thing . ) A sheriff in a small town in southwest Texas must keep custody of a murderer whose brother is trying to help him escape . After a friend is killed trying to muster support for him , he and his deputies - a disgraced drunk and a cantankerous old cripple - must find a way to hold out against the rancher's hired guns until the marshal arrives . In the meantime , matters are complicated by the presence of a young gunslinger - and a mysterious beauty who just came in on the last stagecoach . I wouldn't say this is one of THE favorite films of mine but it is a great film that set the course for many to follow - expertly directed by Hawks and all-around an influential , enjoyable semi-masterpiece .
431129	1173088	388795	9.0	A powerful film - - see it for what it is , and try to ignore the controversy	Those who have protested Brokeback Mountain have likely seen few movies in their lifetime . There's nothing all that daring or new here ? two famous young stars playing gay lovers ? Wow , that's a first . Unless you are aware of a film called " My Own Private Idaho " released a decade and a half ago . You could even be daring enough to claim the first gay cowboy movie was Midnight Cowboy . And let's face it ? sexual taboo has been a regular theme in many European films for years . The only difference here is that Brokeback has hit the mainstream and it's been in the Oscar competition , which means more people are likely to be made aware of it ? and attack it . The bottom line is : it's not really deserving of the hype about it being a " gay movie . " It is , however , far more deserving of its critical hype ? the praise critics have bestowed upon it for being a good movie . Because it is a good movie . It's a very good movie . Ang Lee is a fine director ( if overly ambitious at times ? his Hulk was a failure because it tried too hard , the opposite of most comic-book movies ) ? this is his swan song . At times it is subtle and quiet and at others deeply moving , featuring a graceful dramatic arc that makes a wide sweep across many years in the lives of two men who " ain't queer " but are inexplicably drawn to each other as time progresses . The interesting aspect dealt with here ? and what makes it better than the gay-exploitation romantic-drama it could have easily been ? is that Lee's film studies the impact a forbidden relationship has on two men over a span of time . Both men ( played by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal in the best performances of their careers ) become married and have children ? but they also both return to Brokeback Mountain , the place that sparked their secret relationship . There are moments that go on too long or are too slow . There are also a few scenes that cry out , " Independent ! " ( It's got that new Focus Features edge that " The Station Agent " and " Eternal Sunshine " both also had . ) However , for the most part it's a masterfully shot motion picture that deals less with homosexuality and more with the concept of love in general . I don't think the movie's intent is , as some people boycotting Wal-Mart for selling the film have claimed , " to spread homosexuality . " Anyone who becomes gay after seeing a movie about gay cowboys probably wasn't very straight to begin with . If you see this film , see it for what it is ? don't focus too much on the controversy , because it's just publicity at this point . But underneath the controversy-hype there's a really strong , powerful film ? yup , far superior to " Crash " ( which insulted my intelligence ) ? waiting to break free . A lot of people will feel uneasy watching it ( voting statistics on IMDb reveal that the male demographics are responsible for much lower votes than women ) . Then again , a lot of people will just refuse to even give it that much of a chance and will bash it without even seeing it . That's a shame .
430791	1173088	372784	10.0	Studies the man behind the mask instead of the bat-nipples and gloss .	" Batman " is all about a man who battles his enemies and inner demons . It's about fear , acceptance , morality and reality : Batman is not a superhero , contrary to popular belief . He doesn't have extraordinary powers . He's human , physically and emotionally . That is why Batman has always appealed to me , and I imagine many others feel the same way . I don't read comics , so I can't be one of the many angry fans who claim Tim Burton's 1989 adaptation was poor ; but as a film , it didn't really focus on the psychological aspects of the story , so I can see their point . Michael Keaton was an unconvincing Bruce Wayne ? he wasn't believable as a suave playboy or a ruthless billionaire . Jack Nicholson was fun as the Joker , the sets were gloriously dark and Gothic , but at its heart the film was as cold as its exterior . There was nothing of actual substance ? seen today the film is just an entertaining comic book-movie with good visual design that could have been better . The sequels came and went , none of them living up to the original , and the casket was sealed in 1998 with " Batman and Robin " ? considered by many to be one of the all-time worst films in existence . ( And I agree . ) The problem , I think , is that all these films ignored what is explored so proficiently in " Batman Begins : the fragmented mind of a billionaire who grew up under the constant shadow of his family's legacy , and never wanted to accept his reality ; a man who learns to hate crime ( and more specifically criminals ) after his parents are murdered before his eyes by a lowly street thug . Bruce Wayne is a fascist at heart ? but has enough moral fiber to resist devolving into an executioner . " That is the only thing that separates us from them , " Bruce says in " Batman Begins . " And that's something that the film latches on to ? amongst other topics ? and what makes it not only the best of the " Batman " movies , but also a great film by any standard . I admire the technical skill of this production . The fight scenes are fast and blurred ? I usually hate this , but it works well in " Batman Begins , " because we're meant to fear the unknown . Sounds are used to great effect . Cinematic ally , Batman becomes a movie monster on occasion ? the scene where a group of smugglers are picked off one-by-one in the darkness , with scattering sounds overhead and screams and gunshots piercing the silence , brings to mind Ridley Scott's " Alien . " In another segment , Batman questions Crane while he is on drugs , which results in some truly terrifying images that will shock children who are familiar with Batman as a flawless hero . I also like the fact that Christopher Nolan ? who admittedly does not prefer using modern special effects ? bases his film around the characters so much indeed that he uses very little CGI . Apart from a few action sequences and swarms of bats , most of " Batman Begins " is real , and that really impressed me . ( I do not like modern effects , either . ) I could tell the city was real , I could tell the Batmobile was real , and I could tell Batman was real . Remember the segment in " Batman and Robin " where they surf 30 , 000 feet above ground on pieces of an exploding rocket ship and look like cartoon characters ? There's none of that crap here . Bale is perfect as Batman , and the best yet , because he fits every aspect of the character ; he is believable as a smug , ruthless playboy . We can see him as a troubled young man haunted by his past and an unbearable sense of guilt . And in the suit , he looks confident without being comfortable ? he's still learning how to adapt . We can imagine how far he will progress in the sequels when , at the end of " Begins , " he has finally become the Batman we all know . The movie is grim like Burton's but more realistic , and not as glossy and perfect ; the suit is imperfect , Batman's technology and secrets are exposed , the Batmobile is ugly and efficient , and the bat cave was originally part of the underground railroad and doesn't have any gadgets or special super-duper display cases for the suits . ( I never did understand the point of encasing the Bat Suit in a special shiny glass container when no one was supposed to even see it except Bruce and Alfred . ) " Batman Begins " is to Burton's " Batman " what Burton's " Batman " was to the Adam West version . It's darker . It's surprising . It's better . This is the best " action " film of the summer ? one that doesn't favor CGI over characters or huge overblown action sequences instead of humble moments of dialogue . Sure , there's action . There's a cool fight sequence aboard a train . But because the characters are given depth , we actually care about them , which is something George Lucas could learn from . In an era when bigger is better , and audiences are used to Batman making his appearance on-screen in mere minutes of each film , " Begins " does something completely unexpected ( and risky ) . It actually takes its time . Bruce Wayne doesn't don his famous suit and cape for the first hour of the film ? and when he finally does , the costume isn't fantasized . It's imperfect , awkward and ugly . And best of all , there are no bat-nipples this time . All considered , is it really so surprising that " Batman Begins " has only made a disappointing $71 million in its first week ? Audiences are not used to blockbusters of such depth and beauty . Note : I had to trim my plot summary in this review because IMDb has a 1 , 000 word limit . Go to my website if you want to read my full review .
430619	1173088	97576	10.0	" Spielberg is back in form here , after the horrid ' Temple of Doom sequel . ' The Last Crusade ' brings Indy back to where he belongs , with deserts , Nazis , and the Indiana Jones ' feel . ' "	Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade ? Director : Steven Spielberg ? Starring : Harrison Ford , Sean Connery , John Rhys-Davies ? Co-Producer : George Lucas ? Indiana Jones is back in ' The Last Crusade , ' which , surprisingly enough , is not the last crusade , keeping in mind that there is a fourth film being filmed soon . Harrison Ford returns to the role of archeologist Dr . ' Indiana ' Jones , along with some old faces ( John Rhys-Davies ) as well as some new ( Indy's father , played by Sean Connery ) . In this sequel , Indiana Jones must find another ancient artifact ( a goblet ) before some Nazis do . After all , he is Indy . Unfortunately for him , the only man who can and must help him is his father , Sean Connery ( I think his name's Henry in the movie , but I honestly can't remember ) . Spielberg is back in form here , after the horrid ' Temple of Doom ' sequel . ' The Last Crusade ' brings Indy back to where he belongs , with deserts , Nazis , and the Indiana Jones ' feel . ' You see , the ' Temple of Doom ' sequel was so miserable because not only did they try to turn the Indy character into some sort of super-man , but they also tried some elements that just did not work . When I say this , I mean the sidekick ( ' Shortstuff ' ? a very forgettable ' pal ' ) , the location ( Some jungle out in Africa , was it ? ) , the plot ( Cults ? Wasn't the original film about artifacts ? Shouldn't they stick to what worked ? ) Et cetera ? This Indiana Jones movie , however , gets back on track , like I said before . It just ' feels ' more like an Indiana Jones movie . Harrison Ford is ( once again ) completely believable as Indiana Jones . As I said in my ' Raiders ? ' review ( which can be found on this same site ) , Ford's character is not as gungo-ho as the stereotypical adventure hero . We feel he carries out his missions with a smug smirk because he is ? simply ? Indiana Jones , and that is what he must do . Sean Connery is excellent as Indiana's father , completely convincing as an ex-adventurer who still has it in him for one last go as a daredevil . A Scottish father for Indy may seem a bit weird , but really , is it ? John Rhys-Davies returns to his ' Raiders ? ' role with a warm welcome ? he is still utterly loveable and moving as his character . And then there is young River Phoenix , who makes a small appearance in the beginning of the film as a teenaged Indiana Jones . I love the entire beginning sequence , because not only does it give us a glimpse into the background of the Jones character ( motivation behind it all , etc . ) but also , we find out how Indy got his nickname ( Phoenix walks into the Jones residence and we find out his pet dog's name is Indiana ) . And then there are the great locations , cinematography and excellent tongue-in-cheek gags that may not be as good as the original film , but to me , finalize the Jones chapter in concrete . That is why I am a bit sad to hear another sequel has been planned . It will be nice to see Indy again , but is it really necessary ? I think that at Ford's age ? sixty-something ? Ford will come across as more of a cripple than any hero . Still , I'll be one of the first in line to see it when it ( eventually ) comes out . I'd have to give ' Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade ' stars . ' Raiders of the Lost Ark ' gets , and ' Indiana ? Temple of Doom ' gets . Kudos to Spielberg , Lucas , Ford , Connery , Davies and Phoenix , plus all the others who made the trilogy what it is today . stars - John Ulmer
430590	1173088	80339	10.0	Arguably one of the funniest films ever made	" Airplane ! " is , was and always shall be the master of spoof movies . It is single-handedly responsible for literally inventing a sub-genre of comedy . It is the ultimate Silly Movie . A satire of the disaster movies of the 1970s , particularly the " Airport " series , nothing makes sense and it doesn't need to . There's no real plot . Just laughs - and plenty of ' em . It was helmed by the ZAZ trio ( Zucker , Abrahams and Zucker ) , whose dedication to making the audience laugh is surprisingly adamant . Recent spoofs may have left a bad aftertaste in your mouth , but it seems to be a universal agreement : " Airplane " is the funniest film of its genre ever made . ( Closely followed by " The Naked Gun " - also penned by the ZAZ trio - perhaps . ) The plot : Ted Striker ( Robert Hays ) is a war veteran-turned-cab-driver who decides to chase after his girlfriend , an airline stewardess named Elaine ( Julie Hagerty ) , who has dumped him in order to pursue a new life . Right before her plane takes off , Ted climbs aboard , hitching a ride in order to woo her back into a relationship again . When the aircraft is in midflight , both pilots become very ill after eating their meals . Eventually many passengers begin to show symptoms of a rare disease , apparently transmitted by the food . Onboard , Dr . Rumack ( Leslie Nielsen ) takes care of the sick passengers as Ted - an ex-fighter pilot from the war - decides to try and land the plane . If he messes up they will all die , and in a particularly funny scene , the pressure becomes so unbearable that he begins to literally sweat gallons in the cockpit . That is essentially all the film is about , but most of its duration is spent cracking jokes . Spoof films are entirely different from other movies because normally we would criticize a film if it considered its plot to be the least important element . Not so here . This is a truly brainless piece of celluloid - a movie that doesn't try to be anything that it isn't . From the opening credits - that cleverly spoof " JAWS " - to the closing we realize that this is an altogether unique film going experience . The movie's biggest laughs come through unexpected flashbacks , such as when Ted remembers where he first met Elaine in a crummy bar ( " . . . it was worse than Detroit . . . " ) , and begins to disco-dance a la John Travolta from " Saturday Night Fever " ( complete with Bee Gees soundtrack blaring in the background and the famous Travolta pose ) . Then , later , we are taken back to when Ted was hospitalized after the war , and finds out that he was responsible for the death of six men . " Seven , actually , " he is informed , which adds to the pain of the moment for him . Though this movie is very funny , many jokes misfire . If you're not pop culture savvy and you don't remember Mrs . Cleaver from TV's " Leave it to Beaver " , the humor is going to go over your head . But unlike many comedies , " Airplane ! " offers something unique for each person . I know that as a film lover , I picked up on many movie in-jokes that some people might not recognize . And then there were the gags that I first missed but picked up after a second viewing , or when someone explained them to me , or both . And I'm sure there are many yet that I'm not aware of . It seems that every time I watch it , there's something else to laugh at that I missed previously . " Airplane ! " not only was a huge success in 1980 ( the year of its release ) , spinning off a horde of imitators and one sequel - it was also responsible for crowning Leslie Nielsen " The King of Spoof . " Prior to " Airplane ! " Nielsen had been a veteran of more serious productions , stemming back to playing cowboys on " The Mickey Mouse Club " and other embarrassing attempts at acting . However , Nielsen later claimed that he had always wanted to do a comedy , even when he first started acting seriously with projects such as the classic " Forbidden Planet " ( one of the best science-fiction films ever made ) . He later reunited with the ZAZ trio for " The Naked Gun " trilogy , appeared in similar spoof films over the years such as " Wrongfully Accused " and " Scary Movie 3 , " and had his iconic comedy shtick ripped off by many screen veterans - most noticeably by George Gaynes in the unbearable " Police Academy " ( 1984 ) . When it comes down to a single evaluation , " Airplane " is simply the best spoof film ever made . It's like a MAD Magazine parody come to life . There are the occasional misfires , but unlike many other spoof film imitators , this one contains far more hits . The deadpan acting is genius and everything else fits into place , resulting in what may arguably be one of the absolute funniest films ever conceived and put on the big screen . And if you decide to watch the movie , don't blink - you might miss a gag or two . The " Police Academies " will come and go but " Airplane ! " will never be forgotten .
429908	1173088	85794	10.0	" Taxi Driver " with comedy ? It works !	" Better to be king for a night than a schmuck for a lifetime . " As Travis Bickle's universally known line of dialogue from " Taxi Driver " has a deep meaning ( " Are you talkin ' to me ? Well I'm the only one here " ) , Rupert Pupkin's closing speech of his first-ever standup comedy routine in " The King of Comedy " finalizes the entire meaning of the film , wrapping it up in one short sentence . Is it better to have one great day versus nothing ? Do the ends justify the means ? Two questions all of us ask ourselves at one point of time in our life . The comparisons to Travis Bickle seem stronger on paper than they do in the film . The most striking resemblance between the two stories is that both contain the central theme of a man snapping and doing something apparently crazy . Both films star Robert De Niro , and both are directed by Martin Scorsese , which makes for an interesting discussion of relation . Some may even say that it's a sequel in sorts . Rupert Pupkin ( De Niro ) is a lonely man whose daily life and routines consist around one man : Jerry Langston , a talk show host and comedian who is followed by a horde of rabid fans , including Masha ( Sandra Bernhard ) , a fan to rival Pupkin , who admits that he has waited nine hours at a time outside Jerry's recording studio to catch a glimpse of him as he is shoved into limos by fancy bodyguards . Rupert is given a rare opportunity to speak to Jerry one day as he saves him from Masha , who assaulted Jerry with kisses and hugs . It is as they drive away together and Rupert talks to Jerry that he proposes his long-time dream , which is to appear on Jerry's show as an aspiring standup comic . Of course , he's had no experience . But Rupert swears he would be great on stage - - he's studied Jerry for years and knows timing . Langston gets these psychos all the time , but he doesn't realize just how strong a fan Rupert is until he shows up at his private home with suitcases and a girl claiming to have been invited . " I made a mistake , " Rupert says . " So did Hitler , " Jerry barks . Jerry Lewis plays Jerry Langston in a self-referential ( and very unflattering ) role . It's his finest to date . The guy is a scumbag who barely tolerates fans and is cruel . Lewis has lost his manic , energetic , annoying comedy rituals seen in films such as " The Nutty Professor " and has moved on to real acting that demands true skill . Gone are the squeaky voice and the crossed eyes . Here is perhaps the wretched soul who really exists behind Jerry Lewis , as we know him . All of us exaggerate , but Rupert does so to an extreme . After being shoved out of Jerry's limo the night of their confrontation with an invitation to call Jerry's secretary to schedule a meeting , Rupert shows up at Jerry's office claiming to have an appointment . " Is Jerry expecting you ? " he is asked by a clerk . " Yes , I don't think so , " Rupert says . Jerry and his workers , who deny his taped comedy routine that we never hear until the end , shun Rupert . " Oh , I see , this is what happens to people like you from all of this ! " Rupert yells at Jerry . " No , " he replies . " I've always been like this . " So Rupert breaks down and kidnaps Jerry with the help of Masha , demanding a spot on his TV show as a ransom payment . He commands that he will be referenced to as " The King of Comedy " ( hence the title ) , and to further demonstrate the innocence of Rupert's character , when he shows up , he fails to see the gravity of the offence he has just committed . Rupert is twisted , as you may have guessed by now , but not in a Travis Bickle kind of way . He doesn't see the bad in the world - - he's oblivious to it . " You're so naive ! " Masha tells him . I wouldn't be surprised if he took it as a compliment . Rupert lives in complete isolation , kept locked up with his mother and living his life by what he says on TV . His dialogue and mannerisms are all clichéd - - he says the kind of stuff one would expect a poorly written film to feature . When he tries to impress a female bartender , and when he tries to make small talk with Jerry , he frightens both individuals ( similar to Travis Bickle frightening Senator Palantine and the Secret Service Agent ) . As Rupert takes the stage at the end of the film , his entire dreams have been laid forth in front of him and he takes them by the throat . It is in that truly startling moment we've all been waiting for when we learn that Rupert is not only funny , but pretty darn talented . If the movie had used Rupert's life-long dreams as the butt end of a joke , if he had turned out to be an absolutely horrid comedian ( which is what I honestly thought would happen ) , the film would have little effect . But as a filmgoer and critic , it ranks as one of the most surprising scenes I have ever laid eyes on . stars . - John Ulmer
431147	1173088	468569	10.0	Hyperbole aside , this is still a brilliant crime thriller and the best " comic book movie " I've ever seen . The entire cast is phenomenal and Heath Ledger is a revelation .	" Batman Begins " was a critical success and audiences loved it , but - - probably due to the declining quality of the films before it - - not many people turned out to see it during its theatrical run . It was also one of the first of many " franchise reboots " - - yet wasn't clearly advertised as such , and it took time for people to realize that , as a film , it stood on its own from the Burton / Schumacher pictures . It was a modest success ( with less than $400 million worldwide ) but its real legacy was solidified on DVD , where it became a best-seller and one of the defining titles of the Hi-Definition DVD war . Positive word of mouth slowly but surely turned it into a blockbuster - - the exact opposite of , say , " Spider-Man 3 , " which opened huge but performed poorly on home video . Warner Bros . had a keen eye on the progress of the film , and obviously they had a lot of faith in director Christopher Nolan and the areas he could take the sequel . Whereas " Batman Begins " was a so-called " origins story " and therefore had to sacrifice a few action sequences in favor of character progression , " The Dark Knight " showcases a more organic blend - - there's plenty of action here but there's also just as much character development , which - - at least for me - - made it somewhat more satisfying . I really liked " Batman Begins , " but " The Dark Knight " makes it look like child's play . Everybody was excited about The Joker , of course . And Heath Ledger is phenomenal . I remember when he was first announced for the role in 2007 and the Internet community was , to say the least , quite baffled . I was one of the few who seemed to have an understanding of what Nolan was aiming for , but some fans despised the casting decision . It wasn't until the first theatrical trailer that a palpable shift in mood could be detected - - suddenly all the doubters realized just how dark Ledger was taking it . And shortly thereafter , of course , Ledger died tragically of an accidental prescription drug overdose - - I still remember reading the news that day in January and thinking , " What ? ! " I don't think anyone ever expected it . And although in retrospect it was a rather selfish thought , one of my first questions was : " How will this affect ' The Dark Knight ' ? " Thankfully , Ledger had completed filming on the movie and his last performance is a real tour-de-force . Many people have a nostalgic affinity for Jack Nicholson's Joker , but honestly , I've always found it to be Jack playing Jack more than anything . Yes , it's a fun performance , but not nearly as terrifying or convincing as Ledger's , whose Joker isn't just funny or just dark - he's a twisted psychopath . You find yourself laughing at the most horrific aspects of his behavior , but often times - - such as after the brilliant hospital scene - - you can hear people's laughter in the theater gradually fade as they realize what they're laughing at , and how disturbing it is . And that's really the key to the character , and something even Nicholson didn't land on : the horror behind the laughter . Everything about his performance - the verbal and facial tics , the little details - causes you to believe this psychopath is real . Nolan's remark about Ledger being " like the shark in JAWS " is dead-on - - he isn't a consistent character in this film , but he'll suddenly appear out of nowhere ( in sync with James Newton Howard's and Hans Zimmer's schizoid " Why So Serious ? " theme ) and tear through the movie's core . This is one of the performances of the decade , and the only bad thing about Ledger's role in the film is that it's so good it almost causes you to overlook how good everyone else is . Aaron Eckhart is wonderful as Harvey Dent , and is arguably the most " human " of all the characters in the movie . I found Christian Bale's Bruce Wayne to be surprisingly downplayed in this film , but Eckhart is the one whose character has the most dramatic arc in this movie . It's a testament to Eckhart's skills that he makes Harvey both realistic and tragic - - you believe this guy is real , even though his emotional and physical transformation takes place over the course of less than an hour . Another aspect I loved is Nolan's direction - - he has found his footing here . I thought his style in Batman Begins was a bit cautious at times , like he was trying to find his comfort zone for a big franchise film , but he's far more self-assured here - - the back-and-forth editing between scenes really heightens the tension . It makes " The Dark Knight " less of an action film and more of a crime / mystery thriller - - there are some remarkable twists in this picture and the build-up is , at times , unbearable . I could go on about this film for ages , but I've already run out of room . Suffice to say , it's every bit as good as I had hoped . Is it the " best film of all-time " ( as its current ranking on IMDb would imply ) ? No , of course not . But in all honesty , and hyperbole aside , it is one of the best films I've seen this entire decade and certainly one of the most remarkable - - especially for its genre . Nolan has taken " light entertainment " and given it brains , heart , and depth - - even more so than the first time around . On top of that , he's given us villains and anti-heroes we care about - - backed by superb performances by all involved . It's a wonderful motion picture experience , and the feeling it gave me after it had all ended can only be described as " emotionally draining . " Like the best works of Scorsese or Fincher or other gritty / visceral directors , this movie left me feeling overwhelmed when it had ended - - but in a good way . If you see one movie this summer , make sure it's " The Dark Knight . "
430280	1173088	113277	10.0	An epic crime film .	At the center of Michael Mann's " Heat " is a simple cop-and-robber story , but the film's understanding of its two leads , and their deep affinity and respect for each other , is what essentially propels the film into greatness . It stars the two biggest names in Hollywood , Al Pacino and Robert De Niro . For over thirty years , their performances have created critical milestones in acting . Although they both starred in Francis Ford Coppola's " Godfather " series , chronology prevented them from appearing on-screen together . Over the years , their performances stirred the entire world . Pacino electrified with " Serpico , " " Dog Day Afternoon , " " Scarface , " " Scent of a Woman , " " Donnie Brasco , " " The Insider " ; De Niro impressed audiences and critics alike with " Taxi Driver , " " The Deer Hunter , " " Raging Bull , " " Once Upon a Time in America , " " The Untouchables , " " Cape Fear , " " GoodFellas , " " A Bronx Tale , " and " Casino . " Both actors have won Best Actor Academy Awards , and have attracted fervent die-hard cinema fans . " Heat " marks their first - - and , to date , only - - film where they actually appear together in the same frame . Their first meeting takes place in a small diner off a freeway . Their calmness and mutual respect is what separates it from a similar story that might have them involved in foot-and-gun chases for the entire running time . This diner confrontation is ultimately one of the major reasons the film impresses . Pacino has been playing the same characters since " Scent of a Woman , " frequently yelling , " Hoo-hah ! " and randomly shouting . His recent role in " Angels in America " was the perfect example of this tiresome persona - - a great actor who is starting to become lost ( De Niro still has it , as far as I'm concerned , but Pacino needs to be careful ) . But if it's any consolation , this sort of frantic performance works well in " Heat , " resulting in the appearance of a tired cop who's been working on similar cases for far too long . Neil ( De Niro ) , a criminal genius , is his perfect nemesis . Once he brings him down , his agenda will be fulfilled . The film is described on the posters as a " Los Angeles crime saga , " about a cop on the trail of a smart villain . The cop is Vincent ( Pacino ) , a newly-married LAPD officer who takes great pride in his job . " It keeps me sharp , " he tells his wife after she complains that he doesn't spend enough time with the family . To Vincent , there is no other life apart from his job . Neil is planning to rip off a bank for millions of dollars . His last heist . He plans to settle down and raise a family , like his partner in crime ( Val Kilmer ) has already done with his wife ( Ashley Judd ) . But you can't escape your past . Neil can only get so far before everything catches up with him . And , like a trapped animal , his only chance at survival is to attack the pursuer , which in this case happens to be Vincent . It is rather unfortunate that Pacino and De Niro are compared to each other so often , since each actor brings something unique to their films . Pacino , with his increasingly raspy voice and occasionally over-the-top performances , is wilder than De Niro . His portrayal of Tony Montana in Brian DePalma's " Scarface " was intense , and that same raw intensity he displayed there is brought to every role he has played over the years . In " Heat , " he plays another intensely breezy , confident character . De Niro is once again the quieter , reserved character , saying little , observing , and controlling everyone around him with those penetrating eyes . He has a face that says , " I own you , " and his intimidation is greater than anything he could ever express in words . The ending of " Heat " is absolutely brilliant , touching and moving . Suffice to say , I will resist spoiling it - - but it's far more tender than you might ever imagine . The film is based on an earlier work of Mann's , called " L . A . Takedown , " which is rumored to be included on the similarly-rumored Special Edition DVD . " Heat " is masterful in the way it manages to balance the two most colossal stars of our time in a film that goes beyond the boundaries of crime thriller and into the realm of cult masterpiece . I do not know if Pacino and De Niro will ever team up again , but if they do , I'd be satisfied if the result is only half as good as " Heat . "
430688	1173088	486141	10.0	One of the funniest DVD special features I've ever seen	This hilarious spoof of classic children's show " Clutch Cargo " had me in tears . It's not at all what I expected when I first bought the " Incredibles " DVD and started watching it . Essentially it begins with Mr . Incredible ( Craig T . Nelson ) and Frozone ( Samuel L . Jackson ) watching a new TV series spin-off of their adventures and exploits . However Frozone takes offense to the film as he is dubbed over by a white man and the animation is horrible and simplistic . The story also includes a bunny named " Mr . Skipperdoo . " I was in tears because anyone who remembers these old ' 60s TV shows with the cheesy moving mouths plastered over top of still drawings will know how appalling they were . This is an adult-geared special feature , and its mediocre rating on IMDb , I'm sure , has something to do with the younger voters not " getting it . "

430610	1173088	98554	10.0	" John Candy uses his natural comedic charm in this film ; he is loveable and huggable . "	' Uncle Buck'If you have read my other reviews , you would have realized that one of my favorite directors is John Hughes . Not because of his teen movies , but because he made my favorite comedy ever : ' Planes , Trains and Automobiles ' with Steve Martin and John Candy . But that has little to do with Uncle Buck ; if you want to read my review on ' Planes ? ' it is on this site . Anyway ? John Hughes ' second to last film he directed was a little , low budget comedy named ' Uncle Buck , ' about a guy named Buck ( John Candy ) and his ordeals of the week . Basically , to make a long story short , Buck's brother and sister-in-law are called out of town because of a family emergency . But , unfortunately , they cannot leave their three children ( a teenager and two smaller kids ) at home , alone . After calling many neighbors to no avail , Buck's brother realizes that the only option left is a big , large slob named Buck . John Candy brings his warm screen presence straight outta ' downtown Chicago to watch the kids for ' A week at the most . ' Little does he know what will ensue . Buck has no idea whatsoever how to care for kids . One of the most endearing things about this comedy is his chemistry and connection with the smaller children . Another funny thing is how Buck handles the teenage girl . She is used to being free , basically ; but Buck , like most parents and adults , has been through things before , and knows everything going on in her life and what it will lead to . He sees right through her boyfriend ' Bug ' to his real intentions . ' Uncle Buck ' has some very , very funny moments . Some of the gags fall short a bit , but it is still a winner . Some of the best parts are stretched-out , making it even funnier . The thing about ' UB ' is that unlike many comedies , there are long segments that are funny , instead of individual jokes throughout like ' Airplane ' and Mel Brooks films . ' Uncle Buck ' is NOT slapstick . It is a comedy , plain and simple . But this does not mean it doesn't have any good lines . There are some funny one-liners that have John Candy saying things like ' Ever heard of a ritual killing , ' etc ? ( anyone who's seen the movie knows what I mean ) . John Candy uses his natural comedic charm in this film ; he is loveable and huggable . Macaulay Culkin has his best role in this film . He was not yet an annoying brat , and could actually handle his lines , for once , without sounding like he is reading off a piece of cardboard ( see ' Home Alone ' and / or ' The Good Son ' ) . John Hughes directs the film in his typical fashion . I'm not sure what that fashion is , but whatever it is , it's good . Basically , when it all comes down to it , ' Uncle Buck ' delivers everything you want in a comedy . It's great for a Friday or Saturday night . It may not be as great as ' Planes ? ' but it sure as heck is funny . Every time I see the freeze-frame ending it makes me want to cry ( well , I feel sad , at least ) , because like ' Planes ? ' the freeze-frame captures John Candy at his best , with his heart shining through . I think that is why he is one of the greatest comedians ever . It makes me sad when I think of his death . We miss you , John . John Candy : 1950-1994
430904	1173088	100212	10.0	Pure Heaven .	After a car is stolen by a gangster : " And where did you learn to jump start a car ? " " I had to learn to jump start ambulances to get invalids to the dialysis machines . " - Joan Cusack and Steve Martin , " My Blue Heaven . " There's a lot of fun to be found in " My Blue Heaven , " a simple little comedy with only good intentions . I find it almost impossible to dislike - it has little offensive material , it isn't a stupid , recycled movie packaged with marketable trimmings . Instead , it is a joyful little flick that knows it is no Oscar winner but still tries to entertain its audience . And it does . " My Blue Heaven " is pure heaven for anyone who appreciates fine comedy - it's a little bit wacky , a little bit goofy , and very , very funny . Steve Martin is perfectly cast as the wild and crazy Vincent Antonelli , a Mafia informer who has been entered into the Witness Protection Program . His wife wants no part of their new , cheery life in a suburban America so she leaves him early on . Rick Moranis is equally well-cast as Barney Coopersmith , the FBI agent assigned to protect Vinnie and make sure his new life is suitable to his comfort . Barney's wife has just left him , too . She complains that he is too anal-retentive . She even mentions that he has a technique for getting equal amounts of butter on his waffles . Meanwhile , Vinnie soon tires of his new life and resorts to crime - first little things , such as marking down prices on meat in the local grocery store - which results in the best single line in the entire film , when a perky employee greets Vinnie . His response is a four-letter-word that isn't nearly as ( c ) rude as it seems it would be at first . Soon he meets up with old partners and crime and they form a new crime syndicate - much to the chagrin of a female police officer named Hannah Stubbs ( Joan Cusack ) , who seems to be the perfect match for Barney Coopersmith . Hannah is unable to prosecute Vinnie because he is a Federal Witness . At first she and Barney hate each other . Then they grow closer . Vinnie watches on with joyful interest . And what makes this movie so enjoyable , in part , is the chemistry between Martin and Moranis . It's their first film together since " Parenthood . " They're a good duo , and Martin is so out of character here you start to forget it's even him playing an Italian mobster . Compare Vincent Antonelli to Neal Page ( Martin's character in " Planes , Trains and Automobiles " ) , and the difference in not only attitude but mannerisms and levels of intensity is clearly evident . Martin can play the middle-class American white male especially well , but this film clearly shows that he has not left his wacky background in such films as " The Jerk " far behind . " My Blue Heaven " came out the same year as " Goodfellas " ( 1990 ) . It was impeccable timing - at the end of " Goodfellas " we are left with the penetrating image of Ray Liotta's character Henry Hill outside a suburban home in a cheery neighborhood which , remarkably , looks exactly like the neighborhood in " My Blue Heaven . " It could be argued that " My Blue Heaven " is an immediate sequel in some senses . Where " Goodfellas " left off " My Blue Heaven " starts - it just throws in some comedy . Which is why I don't understand its small impact when it first arrived in theaters . ( Suffice to say , it sorta flopped . ) I own this film on a VHS tape I purchased for $4 . 99 at Wal-Mart . I found it lying in the bottom of a discount video barrel with no-name titles . There are comedic gems that have gained respect over the years , and then there are comedic gems that have slipped by unnoticed . " My Blue Heaven " wasn't very noticed upon its release in 1990 , the few critics who saw it seemed not to pay any attention to it . Funny how some of the most joyful comedies slip by . My Blue Heaven " is a few laughs short of a comic masterpiece . .
431082	1173088	283087	10.0	Disappointed . . . but still fun to play once in a while	I really liked the first Turok game , so when the 2nd came out I bought it . At first I put it on and I could see how dark it was . I mean I knew it was called " seeds of evil " but I didn't think it would be as dark as it is . I liked the Iguana entertainment video in the beginning , as anyone who's seen the video on the first turok game would like the 2nd one . Unfortunately I can't say the same for the actual game play . Turok is no longer the same character , it is a new turok named jason or something , and he looks different . Everything is hard to see ( because it's so dark ) , the weapons are evil looking , the boss ' and bad guys are as well , and THERE WERE NO DINOSAURS . . . . that had me going . The only dinosaurs were genetically engineered and they walked like Arnold Schwarzenegger in a cheesy looking dinosaur costume . I barely ever play the game it was such a disappointment . Only once in a while is it fun to turn on the game , get out the shotgun and blow away the enemys . Then after about 15 minutes you put the game away for a few months again . . . . and it pretty much goes on like that . The game was extremely disappointing and no wonder it was such a flop . stars ( ps ) If you want a cheat type in " BEWAREOBLIVIONISATHAND " , to activate the cheat mode
429456	1173088	265459	10.0	You won't be developing your photos again !	" One Hour Photo " is exactly what I expected . A very well made , entertaining chiller-thriller that is memorable and notable , but not altogether one of the best thrillers ever . It's one of those that people will be talking about for about a year , but will then vanish , much like the other thrillers about psychopathic psychos . Robin Williams is the psycho in this film , named Sy Parrish , a . k . a . Sy the Photo Guy , as he is called by the son of a family he develops photos for at SavMart , which the director described as a kind of " Target meets K-Mart . " Though the obvious similarity is Wal-Mart . Sy takes his job at SavMart personally - - very personally . He's the one hour photo technician . And , as he narrates to us in the beginning , most people do not realize that photo developers actually look at the pictures you have taken when they develop them . What if one of these onlookers was a complete oddball ? Weirdo ? Psycho ? What if ? Let's say the guy makes an extra copy of your photos , just for him to take home and study . Soon that guy starts to think he is actually part of your family . That's when things really start to go haywire . He comes into your life , doing bizarre things . This technique has been used before , but what makes " One Hour Photo " so much better is its main character , Sy . He has feelings , emotions , and thoughts . Most slasher-flicks are about little crazy guys that we can't relate to , but you feel for Sy , and , as he does a few things , you start to believe what he is doing - - though odd - - is kind of good . Robin Williams is getting critical acclaim for giving a " terrifying performance . " For a moment , I'm going to pretend I know what that means . To me , Williams does not give a terrifying performance . He gives an excellent , scary , but deep performance ; as I mentioned above , he's more than some shallow slasher with a knife going after everyone . He has emotions , feelings , thoughts , and we can see them on the surface . I thoroughly enjoyed " One Hour Photo . " The directing is classic , the acting talent is superb , and I guess I'm probably the only one who thought Williams ' character is actually kind of the good guy . He reminds me of Michael Douglas in " Falling Down " : His bubble has burst , and he's serving up his own justice . What Williams ' character , Sy , does at the end of the film , is actually kind of justified . And that's what makes this movie so different from all the other " psychological thrillers " out there . stars - John Ulmer

430930	1173088	150742	10.0	An offer you can't refuse !	Everyone knows the " Godfather " movies . If you don't by now , you probably don't belong on this site . ( Just kidding . . . everyone is welcome ! ) In 1992 , Francis Ford Coppola assembled together the entire footage from all three of his " Godfather " movies and spliced them back together again in chronological order . . . along with about 30 minutes of deleted scenes , making the outcome clock in at about 530 minutes altogether ( astounding ! ) . The movie compilation was released on VHS and played on TV as part of a mini-series type deal , but I never got around to seeing it back then . Watching it now it really adds a new aspect to the familiar story and truly compliments the original films - it doesn't seem like an unnecessary cash-in . Part of what I enjoy about the first sequel is its non-chronological passage of events . . . flashbacks to Don Vito's days really contrasted Michael's conflicts in a superb way . . . but I don't really have any beefs with Coppola changing that for the sake of a new and unique narrative . It makes it more interesting for this particular project . It starts off with scenes from " The Godfather Part II " - a young Vito Corleone emigrates from Corleone , Sicily ( and no , the film wasn't actually shot there . . . I went to the real town of Corleone and it's nothing like in the film ) to Ellis Island at the turn of the century . Once there he eventually opens his own business , gets a wife and births children - including Michael , his beloved son . Vito becomes a Mafia Don and after many years Robert De Niro transforms into Marlon Brando , whose son Michael ( now played not by a baby , but rather a baby-faced Al Pacino ) is reluctant to join the " business . " He's in the military and all is going well with him and his girlfriend ( Diane Keaton ) but then an assassination attempt leaves his older brother dead and his father in intensive care . In order to defend his family he must kill a corrupt cop and Mafia kingpin . He does this and then flees to Sicily ( and , if you've read the book " The Sicilian " by Mario Puzo , you'll be aware of what fate awaits him there ) . This stuff goes on forever and I could give a detailed plot description but I'd be ruining whatever you might not have seen . Overall there's nothing I can really say about this other than that it's an interesting spin on the movies . If you want my opinion on the other films you'll have to search my archive here on IMDb , they'll all available if you care so much as to read them ( which I highly doubt ) . Suffice to say Coppola's remix of his movies is a refreshing twist on the saga . . . I enjoyed it and although it's something of a monster to sit through ( I recommend an hour or two per night , which I don't ever usually like to do with other films ) , you'll find the time passes by pretty quick at times .
430553	1173088	137523	10.0	One of the best films of the decade and also one of the most important	The first time I saw " Fight Club " I despised it . I found its message stupid and contradictory - it was a hypocritical film that preached against violence yet was more violent than any other recent films including " The Matrix " ( which is not quite as realistic as " Fight Club " ) . I saw it again on television a few years later and thought it was a bit better and not quite as horrible , but still didn't enjoy it much . However I was convinced into buying the DVD and seeing it again just because it had been rated the 37th best film of all time on IMDb ( it's now # 41 ) . Well I'm happy to report that I found " Fight Club " utterly brilliant on third viewing . Since then I've seen it more than a handful of times on DVD and it just gets better each time . Brad Pitt gives a fantastic performance as one of the coolest cinema icons of all time : Tyler Durden ( whose name is a reference to Travis Bickle of " Taxi Driver " - according to something I read the first name is harsh , the last name simple and soft ) . Edward Norton gives an Oscar-worthy performance as The Narrator , " Jack , " whose actual name isn't ever truly revealed . ( Many people don't seem to notice this . ) I won't go into the plot and won't go into a deep analysis because so many other people have done it so well . Suffice to say it IS a very violent movie but I find its style infectious and David Fincher's direction wonderful . It is a brutal and weird film and sometimes it is a bit too pretentious and clever for its own good - I won't lie and say that it's flawless and I totally understand why so many critics bagged on it for being " a laborious dog " on its initial release . The British DVD includes a mocking pamphlet where the filmmakers brag about how they all knew it was going to be great from the start and I think this is a bit too masturbatory - the fact that they include critics ' negative reviews as a mockery is humorous but childish , and I can understand why some might view " Fight Club " as a very childish , contradictory film . ( After all , I used to think the same thing . ) However I really have come to love it despite its flaws . I think Tyler Durden is one of the absolute coolest characters of all time and Pitt plays him so well it's scary . Norton embodies the Bored Working Repressed Everyman flawlessly . Fincher is great behind the camera . And the film's message strikes a chord nowadays when I watch it - it is a bit contradictory and some of the violence really isn't needed , but then again I'm not going to complain because I've never really cared too terribly much about violence in films so I'm not going to start now . Overall this is one of the most important films of the 1990s and its message was missed by a lot of people ( myself included ) back in 1999 . In a year of some really good movies " Fight Club " was probably the best and is one of my all-time favorite films . It's easy to see how this might be considered the next " Taxi Driver " thirty years from now .
429461	1173088	306921	10.0	THE Guns N ' Roses show	Guns N ' Roses were always a bit " iffy " live . I've noticed that Axl's voice is very unreliable during shows and he can tend to go out of key and just start screeching , whereas on the actual albums it tends to be harmonic screeching . ( He's always a great singer , but during live concerts he can just tend to get a bit rusty and tired . ) However the famous Live at the Ritz performance in 1988 really solidified Gn'R as a great band and one that would stand the test of time . To this day their albums still sell a large amount on a weekly basis ( I heard Appetite for Destruction sells over 20 , 000 a week worldwide ? For an 18 year old album that's pretty good ! ) and entices new fans ( their Greatest Hits collection was a huge success in the UK and did almost as well in America ) . This is overall a really great show packed full of Appetite's material , and bootleg copies are available that have even more footage .
429834	1173088	833359	10.0	A fine return to form	After a series of fairly disappointing episodes , " The Gang Runs for Office " is a fine return to form for " Sunny . " Returning to the style of the first season ( Season Two has taken a somewhat darker approach so far ) , this episode features Frank ( Danny DeVito ) telling the gang how politicians can make money by soliciting bribes while running for office . This sparks the imagination of Mac ( Rob McElhenney ) who decides to become campaign manager for Dennis ( " He has JFK hair " ) . After Mac is fired , Charlie ( Charlie Day ) takes over as campaign manager . Mac decides to try to solicit a bribe anyway and ends up being blackmailed by politicians he calls " nerds . " Meanwhile , Dee ( Kaitlin Olsen ) is mentored by her father Frank and turned into a bimbo by him so that he can use her as a pawn in a bribe-game with a seedy , sexist politician . This episode has a lot of ironic twists and turns and all the loose plots connect together at the end . It's one of my favorite episodes of Season Two so far and I'd probably rank it as one of the very best of the entire season . I felt let down by the last two or three episodes but this was really a return to form as far as I'm concerned . The writing and jokes are all on par with the season debut ( " The Gang Gets Handicapped " ) and the political incorrectness is hilarious .
430141	1173088	289765	10.0	Returns to the Roots of the " Lambs " . . .	Prequels are messy things . Sequels can be , too , but with a sequel , the filmmakers are creating new ground . In a prequel , the filmmakers are treading into pre-recorded territory , and if they're not careful , they can make the audience feel cheated . But with " Red Dragon , " prequel to " Silence of the Lambs " and " Hannibal , " the audience doesn't feel cheated at all . In fact , it is handled extremely well , and is not only a gripping thriller , but a superbly-performed one , also . It stars Edward Norton as forensic specialist Will Graham , the man responsible for putting Hannibal " The Cannibal " Lecter , as seen in " Silence of the Lambs , " behind bars in the 1980s . The film fades in somewhere in the mid-1980s , where Graham starts to suspect that Hannibal may have something to do with the disappearence of a musician . Will confronts Hannibal , who stabs him in the gut and slowly rips open his stomach . Graham fights back , pushing an arrow from Hannibal's study / den through Hannibal's chest and shooting him some two or three times with a handgun . Hannibal is arrested and thrown in jail . Graham is left in critical condition . Flash-forward " a few years later " to Graham living somewhere in Florida with his wife ( Mary-Louise Parker ) and son . Graham still carries the scar from his last meeting with Hannibal , and it has forever reminded him of his job and just how careful he must be . But then comes along Jack ( Harvey Keitel ) , who asks Graham to take on a new case . . . There is a serial killer on the loose who attacks every full moon . He cuts his victims with shards of glass , then takes the glass and puts the pieces in their eye sockets . He also does some other things too grisly to mention in a family review . Graham , the best-of-the-best forensic specialist , agrees to take on the case , and becomes more intrigued by it and makes it his personal agenda to bring down the killer , known as " The Tooth Fairy , " or the " Red Dragon " ( hence the title ) , who is played by Ralph Fiennes . But as the case becomes more misleading and confusing , Will finds himself seeking the advice of Hannibal the Cannibal on his particular case . And as Will faces his greatest fear , the clock ticks until the next strike by the Red Dragon . Fans will be pleased to know that Hannibal has lost none of his creepiness since " Silence of the Lambs . " Fans will also be pleased to know that after the " Hannibal " flop , " Red Dragon " returns to the roots of the original . I thought that " Hannibal " was proof the series ' creepiness had outstayed its welcome . Hannibal's persona only works once , apparently . . . well , if you think that , you're wrong . Because " Red Dragon " is equally as frightening as " Silence of the Lambs , " if a bit more unrealistic at times . And it's also a bit more typical for its genre in some respects than " Silence . . . " , but it's still very thrilling . In fact , the ending could be considered predictable , but it's not for two reasons . 1 . Unlike other horror films where you just KNOW the killer's still alive , " Red Dragon " really makes you think the killer is dead , but the surprise is . . . can you guess ? 2 . In most of the horror films out there , when the killer is supposedly dead , there is a moment of happiness and the film seems as though it is over , but you know there's just something wrong with the abrupt end to the thrills . It shows the family at home , extremely happy , until . . . the kid who went inside to get food hasn't returned . The parent goes in to look for him , and the answering machine clicks on . A cop at the station says , " He's not dead ! Get outta the house ! " Big surprise : The killer's upstairs with the kid , holding a knife to his throat . All this happens in " Red Dragon " one way or another , but you don't feel as cheated as you do watching other thrillers of the same kind . If anything , " Red Dragon " follows a lot of the typical horror / psychological thriller routines , but it's hard to notice . " Red Dragon " does jump through all the hoops of its kind , but if anything , it comes across fresh and thrilling , and this is all I ask for in a thriller . stars - John Ulmer
430895	1173088	109686	10.0	I laughed , I cried , and I think my IQ dropped . I love this movie !	The Marx Brothers . Laurel and Hardy . Abbott and Costello . Jerry Lewis . Every generation has their dose of silliness . The 1990s had Jim Carrey . And along with him came the phenomenal hit " Dumb and Dumber , " a simple tale of two numb skulls who journey to Aspen in search of a woman and happiness . Our tale begins when Lloyd ( Jim Carrey ) is escorting a young woman named Mary Swanson ( the gorgeous Lauren Holly , who Carrey eventually married and then divorced ) to an airport . He falls in love with her in the few minutes they share in the limousine , and after he has dropped her off , he watches her from the outside in his limo and sees her leave behind a black briefcase on the floor inside the airport . Rushing inside , he grabs the briefcase , only to find someone closing the gate to her plane . " It's okay , I'm a limo driver ! " he yells to a ticket checker , rushing down the airport jet way and running straight off of it , falling onto the cement runway below . After retreating to his apartment , he convinces his pal Harry ( Jeff Daniels ) to come with him to Aspen to return the briefcase to Mary . Harry , the smarter one ( or is that dumb-less one ? ) , at first hesitates , and then reluctantly agrees , and so they are off . Little do they know that the briefcase they carry is actually ransom money that Mary was trying to pay to get her husband returned to her . Now with hitment on their tail , Lloyd and Harry make it to Aspen only to wreak even more havoc . Comedic timing is everything in a comedy like this . Carrey and Daniels have chemistry and timing . Check out the scene where they are at the National Preservation Society Gala , and stand at a bar in bright , tasteless suits . The way they stand , talk , and interact is as if they really are bosom-buddies , two idiots without a clue . The film is directed by The Farrelly Brothers , Peter and Bobby . You may remember them as the men who brought us the hilarious " There's Something About Mary . " But truth be told , " Dumb and Dumber " is even better than " Mary . " Whereas " Mary " was a fun summer comedy with big laughs and tons of crude sex jokes , " Dumb and Dumber " is a true comedic gem , and carefully borders the line of tastelessness and taste , something " Mary " crosses over and never turns back to . Is this movie " dumb " ? Yes , absolutely . Will it offend you ? Perhaps if you're a snob . And I'm sure some film elitists will complain that there's nothing substantial or of artistic merit here . I don't think it matters . This movie is meant to entertain and it does so wonderfully . In the past I've given negative ratings to films of the same genre that are just meant to be brain-less , silly fare ( such as " Me , Myself & Irene " ) - the difference here is that " Dumb and Dumber " manages to come across as both likable and entertaining , while still managing to feature characters we can actually , in some crazy way , find ourselves liking . In the end , this is just a very funny movie that is well-made and memorable - much more so than some of its other 1990s " stupid-comedy " counterparts .
430624	1173088	268126	10.0	I get it now .	The first time I saw " Adaptation " I expected something else and walked away severely disappointed . As some of you out there who Private Messaged me in regards to my initial review posted on IMDb might already be aware , I originally gave it a rating of stars , back when I was frequently contributing to the site . I passed on without much thought , considering it a disappointment and leaving my critique for those who cared to read it . It remains the single comment to have generated the most feedback for me . More than " The Passion of the Christ , " and more than yes , even my upsetting review of 2003's " Peter Pan " ( which seemed to anger the small die-hard fanbase for the film that lurks on these message boards - by the way , I've had to clarify this sentence by adding " for the film " because someone PM'd me yesterday accusing me of implying I have a fanbase on IMDb . . . no , I am referring to the film's fanbase , so please hold off on the accusations ) . I digress . In summary I gave " Adaptation " a negative rating and to my surprise , perhaps because I avoided totally slamming the film , the fans responded to me with kind words rather than harsh ones ; conceivably they too had initially taken a dislike to the film ? I made a daring move . I bought " Adaptation " on DVD for ten bucks , thinking , " I've got nothing to lose . " Plus , the front cover looked cool anyway . I watched it again ( after taking into mind several themes and self-referential layers I had failed to visualize before ) and was blown away by the originality and genius of the movie . My hugest complaint regarding " Adaptation , " originally , was its absurd ending - - I felt it was out of place , silly , and totally anti-climactic . Little did I realize this was the point - - to be a parody of the typical Hollywood blockbuster . There are so many underlying jokes , gags and self-references that the film grows better - - like " Back to the Future " - - on each new viewing . You're always finding new stuff . I found new respect for Nicolas Cage as an actor after my second viewing of this . I have always liked Cage despite the criticism he receives for being a one-sided actor ; here , he proves he's capable of creating two very different human beings out of the same mold . Brilliant , Oscar-worthy stuff . All in all I got it wrong the first time . " Adaptation " isn't a film that starts out clever and descends into a messy and stupid finish . Well , actually , it is . But that's the point . I didn't get it before . Now I do . If you disliked this film , my advice ? Watch it again . It knows a bit more about itself than you probably do . And read up on the message boards here a bit to get a clearer grasp of what's going on if you're totally clueless . P . S . I'd like to thank all the people on this site who messaged me in response to my review .
429912	1173088	115147	10.0	Hip , funny , clever .	" The Daily Show with Jon Stewart " is one of the funniest shows on television and probably the cleverest show on Comedy Central ( perhaps tied with " South Park " ) . Jon Stewart was the perfect host - his dry humor and quick wit is great . His group of news correspondants are equally humorous - Steve Carell ( who has now left to pursue a film career ) is the best of the bunch , always doing wacky , crazy stuff for the sake of laughter . The show features interviews , news clips , and so on and so forth - it's a big hit on college campuses because it seems to appeal to the new generation : it reports news but in a sarcastic , cynical fashion . I'm a very cynical person so this show fits me just right .
430607	1173088	198781	10.0	Does For Monsters What " Toy Story " Did For Toys !	Monsters , Inc . We were all , at one time , scared of monsters under the bed . Shadows of clothes in the closet . Weird sounds outside in the trees . I remember thinking there were all kinds of monsters in my room - not as much under my bed as in the closet . And once again , Pixar , who brought us " Toy Story " 1 & 2 , plays on both adults ' memories and children's dreams , making it equally enjoyable for both children and adults . John Goodman voices James P . Sullivan , known as " Sulley " to friends . He is a big , blue , hairy monster with horns on his head and hands the size of a watermelon . Billy Crystal is Mike Wazowski , his wisecracking , one-eyed best friend . Both of these monsters live in Monstropolis , a world where monsters roam freely . Their city is powered by a rare source of power - children's screams . That is where Monsters , Incorporated comes in . At Monsters , Inc . , monsters like Sulley and Mike open portals into children's rooms - through closet doors - and scare the children , capturing their scream in a little yellow bottle . Sulley is the top-scarer , bringing in the most scares . But Randall ( the always enjoyable - even when animated - Steve Buscemi ) , a wormy , multiple-armed lizard-monster with the ability to change appearances to its surroundings , is jealous of Sulley , and will attempt anything to get more scares . . . even if it means taking a child from the real world and bringing it into Monstropolis . But after the child escapes , Sulley and Mike reluctantly look after it , all the while trying to get it back to the real world before Mr . Waternoose ( the late James Coburn ) and others find out about the incident . . . " Monsters , Inc . " does for monsters what " Toy Story " did for toys . Pixar once again not only expands our mind , but our very worlds . I respect their company and commitment values very much , as you can read in my " Toy Story " review . They stick to the values that made Disney films so family-friendly back in the fifties and sixties : Respect for the audience , respect for quality , and respect for the audience's INTELLIGENCE , something Disney , who has recently coughed up a bunch of lousy , thoughtless sequels , has forgotten . Now , I know that LEGALLY Disney is co-creator of " Toy Story " and " Monsters , Inc . , " but they really are not . They just give Pixar the money and get their name branded on the front box of the film . And even then , I have heard multiple claims that Disney is very mean-spirited towards Pixar ( read into sequel trouble for " Toy Story 3 " ) and gives them the bare minimum . But that is straying off the subject . " Monsters , Inc . " is one of the most enjoyable animated films I have ever had the pleasure of viewing . I didn't enjoy it as much the first time , but I then bought it , and have since watched it many times . It is an instant classic . I will be watching it years from now , when I am old and frail and in a rocking chair . It ranks right up there with " Toy Story " 1 & 2 , and all the OLDER Disney films from the 50's-70's . It has all the elements of a sweet , charming , emotional and pleasurably good-natured animated film . And , more coudos to Pixar : Thank you for not packing it full of the language and inappropriate content that Disney shoves into the dark recesses of their films nowadays . Not only has Pixar brought back the " Family Film " genre to what it should be , but it also redefines it . Pixar's animated films are some of the most thoughtful , imaginative and enjoyable animated films ever - not to mention 100 % family safe . Thank you , Pixar , for getting back on track . stars
430974	1173088	95016	10.0	Have a " Blast " Watching " Die Hard " !	Die HardOne of the most full-out action movies of all time . It had the best formula , the best dialogue , the best stunts , the best characters , and the best explosions . " Die Hard . " Bruce Willis plays John McClane , a recently divorced cop who travels to LA for the opening of his wife's new workplace , Nakatomi Plaza , owned by a rich Japanese man . His wife ( Bonnie Bedalia ) is happy to see McClane come , and we feel that they want to get back together . Perhaps this opening party will do it . But then it happens . As John takes a trip to the bathroom , a gang of terrorists ( headed by Alan Rickman ) take charge of the company building , demanding money . John hides out in the building and tries to think of a way to get the bad guys . They have no idea that John McClane is loose in the building , and only realize that someone is out there watching them when an elevator shaft is blown to pieces by Willis . Pretty soon , the LAPD , FBI , CIA , and just about anything with three or more letters is outside , and only one man has contact with John McClane from the outside - Reginald VelJohnson , a cop with a walkie-talkie . This is , without a doubt , Bruce Willis ' best film . By far . His personality fits the persona of John McClane . It's fun watching him , for once . The formula for this movie is what makes it so great , however . Think about it . A man , trapped in a building with some bad guys ; a one man army . The perfect action flick formula . But what makes it even better is the non-stop action and excellent , adrenaline-packed explosions and gunplay . People can criticize this movie for being unrealistic , but everyone needs an escape from reality once and a while . One of my favorite parts is where John grabs a fire hose from the top of the building , ties it around himself , and jumps off the edge of the building , smashing into the outside of the glass . Yes , it is very unrealistic , but I'll be darned if it isn't fun . Reginald VelJohnson , of TV's " Family Matters , " is perfect as The Cop on the Outside , having contact with The Man in the Inside . VelJohnson has mainly gotten supporting roles in films over the years . These credits include " Turner and Hootch , " " Die Hard , " and " Die Hard 2 : Die Harder , " which was more of a cameo than anything else . Regardless , he is a good actor , and it's too bad his career has been so bad lately that he has had to resort to his old days by re-doing his character from " Die Hard " by voicing him in a PC game . It's sad enough when actors resort to videogames , but it's even sadder when video games only want you because of an old character you have played and not because of you , yourself . Of action is your specialty , see " Die Hard " as soon as you can . And if you don't like action . . . well . . . there's always " Gods and Generals " for you !
430703	1173088	42041	10.0	A classic , one of the very best films I've ever seen - Cagney is a god !	" White Heat " may not be typical film noir in the literal sense , but the vibes are unmistakable . It's classic James Cagney noir , and he gives his best performance ever . It's the pinnacle for all future mobster movies - " Godfather , " " Scarface " ( the remake ) and even " GoodFellas " all borrow styles or concepts from this . The ending is eerily similar to Pacino in " Scarface . " Cagney stars as a mobster ( giving one of his snarling performances ) . The plot basically follows his rise and fall . Throughout , he has a strange fascination / obsession with his mother . He loves her more than his girlfriend . This is one element that really impressed me . For a film from 1949 it really handles some seedy elements rather well - this would still raise eyebrows if it were released over fifty years later ! Cagney is absolutely terrific . The film is a huge tour de force , breathtaking and mesmerizing . One of my favorite films , I would write more about the plot but I've found I always end up ruining the movie for people ! ( I have to restrain myself from referencing the ending ! ) If you like film noir , mobster movies or James Cagney ( or all of the above ! ) go buy this movie right now .
429602	1173088	72890	10.0	D Day for Pacino	By the time Sidney Lumet's " Dog Day Afternoon " came around he had already learned to let Al Pacino loose . Forget the holdbacks of " Serpico " ; here we get a glimpse into the real Al , the actor who would bring Tony Montana to life in the years to come and the same man who provided Michael Corleone with such heartfelt warmth that was lacking in some of his lesser characters . There's essentially the Al Pacino as an actor and the Al Pacino as a character , and here he's the character , and it works splendidly . Al Pacino the actor comes into play when he is given a recycled script and a talentless director , which has been happening a lot lately , although fortunately his comparison , De Niro , has been lucky enough to generally avoid these blunders of older-age film-making . This is based on a true story , like " Serpico , " only it's better and more involving . It connects with the audience more than " Serpico " because it doesn't jump through the same old hoops ; it goes for the long trek and comes off better than it would have had the team behind it been lazy . The clichés are gone and the originality creeps in early on . Watch Pacino indulge himself in character and let the plot sink in . It's more touching than it seems at first . Pacino is Sonny Wortzik , a Brooklyn man who takes a bank hostage in order to pay for his " wife's " operation . The wife is actually Leon Shermer ( Chris Sarandon who was Oscar-nominated for this , his first role in a mainstream film ) , Sonny's gay lover who doesn't have the money for a sex operation . The bank robbery was going to be what one of classic cinema's greatest bad guys once described as a quick " in and out , " but Sonny gets held up inside the bank and soon he's all over the news and police are standing outside the building with guns drawn . It's like Denzel's movie only better and more original . Oh , and true . This one actually happened and we can tell . Sonny's partner in crime , Sal ( John Cazale ) , is worried that he'll be treated as a homosexual by the media outside . His fretting is comic relief and one of the connections between the film and the audience . Charles Durning is the frustrated cop handling the situation . His performance is as subtly convincing as Cavale's . Pacino's performance is exceedingly excellent , manic and energetic . He'd display this same talent in " Scarface " again eight years later ; only he would be bashed by the critics for going over-the-top . ( Although they really just had problems with the excessive profanity and violence , just like Mel Gibson's " The Passion of the Christ " will soon become a well-known classic and people will laugh when they hear that someone once called it the most violent film ever made . ) There's also one of the best scenes of all time in this movie that rivals Montana's Last Stand in " Scarface " or the Baptism Scene in " The Godfather , " which involves Sonny speaking on the phone to his " wife , " carefully concealing his motive from any listeners nearby . Watch Pacino delve into character here and you're immediately hooked . We like his character because he seems real and Pacino makes him real , and that's why this will go down as one of the best tour de force performances of all time . Is this Hollywood trying to ease our culture onto homosexuality and sex change operations ? Is Hollywood trying to gradually introduce us to gay characters in the hope that the uptight American families will be increasingly invaded by the images of gay men ? No . This is Hollywood showing us a true story , regardless of the homosexuality . Pacino could be playing a frustrated postal worker and it would still work because it all settles down to the fact that the suspense and dramatics of the movie affect us , not the background of its characters . Sarandon's Oscar nomination was more than worthy ; here he displays the smarmy talent that would shine through in his characters in the years to come . Prince Humperdink from " The Princess Bride " is equally memorable but less realistic . Here he seems more real , which is good for this film and would have been quite bad for " Bride . " We don't like real characters in fantasy tales , do we ? Lumet , who ruined " Serpico " with his bad editing , out-of-place music , clichéd dialogue / events and unnecessary scenes , directs " Dog Day Afternoon " with style and flair and good pacing and a surprisingly heartfelt sense of emotion and care . This isn't exactly a good example of a perfect motion picture but it's pretty close .
430861	1173088	67023	10.0	You won't believe it's Spielberg	We all get stuck behind them sometimes : The huge trucks blocking your lane , blowing diesel fumes and spraying rocks from the ground all over your windshield . You try to pass them but sometimes it's just no use - - they won't move out of the way , no matter how hard you try to mentally will them to do so . Steven Spielberg's " Duel " is just a simple movie about a traveling everyman who tries to pass a huge flammable truck on a state highway , and is then strangely stalked by this angered truck driver who seems to want him dead . The everyman is played by Dennis Weaver , and his character's name in the film is David Mann - - a businessman driving across California for a business meeting who is desperately late and struggling to get around an obnoxious eighteen-wheeler blocking the highway . After he passes the trucker , it seems to trigger a sort of strange road rage game between the two men . At first everything seems to be quite normal , but then the truck swerves around David's car and slows down its speed again , keeping David behind schedule and driving behind a bunch of nasty fumes . Frustrated with the driver's arrogance , David decides to swerve around the truck again , and he soon finds himself on his way down the road , far away from the truck driver . But his escape is not quite so simple . The key to " Duel " is that we never see the truck driver , just like we never saw the shark from " JAWS " in its entirety . The truck driver haunting Mann seems to be a simple man who just suddenly goes nuts . Sometimes the best villains are those given no motivational background - - Michael Myers from " Halloween " was described as " evil " by his own doctor , apparently killing for no reason whatsoever , and the shark from " JAWS " seemed to be the materialization of some sort of demon from hell . Their intentions are not clear - - and that makes the film carry an intriguing mystery about it that makes it all the more watchable on a repetitive basis . I was never a very big fan of " The Hitcher , " which ripped off " Duel " quite a bit . Both films essentially deal with supernatural , untouchable villains shrouded by a layer of mystery . We never found out very much about Rutger Hauer's character in " The Hitcher , " or why he was doing what he was doing , but by introducing him to the audience it made us want to know more - - and the film took the easy way out by just providing us with nothing whatsoever . Even after promising us that it would through the very mouth of Hauer's character . That's bad filmmaking . Spielberg does something different : He avoids the truck driver altogether . Apart from seeing his legs and a brief glimpse of his silhouette , the truck driver is completely shrouded by a dark cloud of mystery and intrigue . Had he been shown rising out of the truck disaster at the end of the film , burning alive like The Terminator , then the effect would be somewhat laughable . Spielberg does something much greater and more fantastic - - this could , in technical terms , be called his most elaborately staged and perfectly executed film , even if it isn't the best on an overall basis . There's a great scene in " Duel " where Mann stops at a roadside diner and tries to analyze his situation . At that point in time anyone could be the villain - - the guy eating a sandwich , the guy with cowboy boots having a soda , or even the woman standing by the exit . But we never know , and either does Mann , and it helps this film quite a bit . But what Spielberg does that is pure genius is showing us Mann's thoughts through voice-over narrative in a way it has never really been done before . We hear Mann talking to himself , but not in an aware way . It is as if we pick up his mental decisions and thoughts via the film - - and it works magnificently . You've probably seen " Speed " by now , and so you know its breakneck speed and thrills . Well , take " Speed , " throw in a homicidal truck driver , and set it in the early 70s , and you've got yourself a clear idea of what " Duel " feels like while you're watching it . It's one of those give - me - a - moment - to - catch - my - breath films - - intriguing and fast-paced from start to finish . Indeed , " Duel " is an early sign of Spielberg before he went commercial - - not that his films aren't good anymore , but they all seem to contain typical Spielberg trademarks . Here , Spielberg shows that he can be a Hitchcockian director - - even " JAWS " was more mainstream-oriented than this film . Originally filmed for ABC in 1971 and later re-released overseas with nineteen minutes of extended footage , " Duel " is indeed a milestone movie - - a counter to the ancient mythology that TV movies aren't any good . They can be . Most of the time they just don't want to be . But thanks to an intriguing idea and a terrific young director behind the project , " Duel " stands as one of the most remarkable films of all time , a sign of great things to come in the career of an aspiring newbie director with not a single true project under his belt . This is Spielberg's breakthrough . He has surpassed it with projects such as " JAWS , " the " Indiana Jones " trilogy and " Schindler's List , " but to say this is one of his most well made and unconventional films is a gross understatement . .
430693	1173088	88247	10.0	The best of the best in its genre . . .	Rarely has a film so frightened an audience as " The Terminator . " After its release in 1984 , the extremely low-budget sci-fi actioner broke box office records , and gave audiences something more to fear . Through the years , there have been stories of nature's beasts , of creatures from another world , and so on and so forth . " Jaws " was terrifying because it seemed so possible . And if " Jaws " is terrifying , " The Terminator " is horrific . The realization of this hit-man machine dawned on everyone watching the film . In a time of exceeding technology , how long will it be before man is overtaken by the very things he created ? And that is what is particularly scary about a film like " The Terminator . " In " The Terminator , " Arnold plays a cyborg , Cyberdyne system model 101 , a T800 , whatever that means . He has been sent back in time to assassinate the soon-to-be-mother of the future world leader , John Connor ( who battles the machines in the future and leads an uprising ) . If Connor is killed , then there will be no one to oppose the machines of the future , and they will triumph . This would be pretty bad . So the future John Connor has sent a protector back in time , to help save his mother . Kyle Reese ( Michael Biehn ) tells Sarah Connor ( Linda Hamilton ) about the machine that is trying to kill her . " It can't be bargained with , it can't feel pain or mercy , and it will stop at absolutely nothing until you are dead ! " Talk about a bad day . The Terminator hunts them down time after time , including the famous police station scene , where Arnie says , " I'll be back , " and returns moments later , crashing through the wall in a car . He then takes on a whole squad of cops , but don't worry , Sarah and Reese escape slightly unscathed . There are countless classic scenes in " The Terminator . " You will see them spoofed your entire life . From the image of the Terminator , to the lines they speak , to the scenes they act out . Everything is spoofed . And the film is worthy of its fame . On the special edition " T2 " DVD ( the second one ) , there is an on-set documentary for the making of the " Terminator 2 " 3-D ride at Universal Studios . As the camera moves around , it shows Cameron detailing what he wants in this scene . Some guy suggests something else , and Cameron gets a tone . " No , no , that won't work . You do it like this - we come off here , he walks around . . . " etc . The point is , he's a perfectionist , and a demanding director . Some directors are a bit too easy , and don't really care where their films are going . But James Cameron seems to have a clear vision of what he wants , and he goes around making sure it gets done exactly the way he wants it to be done . And it shows in his work . It's hard to find any mistakes in a James Cameron film . And it's even harder to find plot holes . Some people say " Terminator 2 - Judgment Day " is better than the original . It's hard to choose , because the two films are very different . I view " The Terminator " as more of a deep , intellectually-consuming , dark thriller . I view " Judgment Day " as an action film , with a more or less recycled plot . ( The plot is still good , but it's still the same , too . ) It's hard to choose a favorite because they are so different . On " T2 " the budget is ten times larger , probably even more than that . But if you want a horror / thriller , " The Terminator " is better for you . If you want special-effects and a really fun time , see " T2 . " They're both excellent films . " The Terminator " is a great movie . It is one of my favorites ; it is terrifying , horrifying , and 100 % entertaining . And unlike a lot of other cheap actioners out there , " The Terminator " has some thought put into its plot , and that is what separates it from the rest of its kind . stars - John Ulmer
