369691	2488512	281865	1.0	Awful	Today I have lost about two hours of my Saturday afternoon watching this crap . This trash is so awful and ridiculous that does not deserve my review . It is enough to read the summary of other IMDb users : - No toilet bowl is large enough to hold the crap this movie produces - Avoid this movie at all costs - So Unfunny - This movie is so bad the producers would not let it be released into theaters - The worst movie I've ever seen . . . - Avoid at all costsTitle ( Brazil ) : ' As Aventuras de Frank McKlusky ' ( ' The Adventures of Frank McKlusky ' )
369226	2488512	382011	2.0	A Complete Mess	Rebecca Haster ( Taturn Adair ) blames herself for the death of her parents and decides to spend sometime alone in the lakeside cottage of her parents in Rushford Lake . She meets Stan James ( Timothy Prindle ) on the road and gives a lift to the stranger . Later they become friends , while Rebecca sees supernatural events with drowned people in the lake . While searching the accidents in the library , she finds that mysterious deaths happen in the spot every thirteen years . I bought this DVD without any previous reference and only based on its creepy cover , since I love zombie movies . Unfortunately , this film is simply awful , with a messy and flawed screenplay . I have no problems with low budget movies with simple special effects , but with good story , direction and performances and this is not the case of " Ghost Lake " . Further , I am not moralist but the lead character Rebecca has the behavior of a slut , having casual sex with two strangers in a couple of days and while grieving the death of her parents . Title ( Brazil ) : " O Retorno dos Mortos " ( " The Return of the Dead " )

My first impression is that this film was cast in the red light district , in a brothel or in the porn industry . Most of the " actresses " shows cellulite and have flaccid bodies , or are simply wasted . I do not know the target audience of this crap , but I believe that even the most fanatic fan of Tinto Brass will be disappointed . Title ( Brazil ) : " Faça Isto ! " ( " Do It ! " )
370648	2488512	372873	3.0	Disappointing and Lame	In accordance with a Korean legend , every five hundred years , a woman protected by a man transforms in a serpent to fight against a dragon in a battle between good and evil . In Los Angeles of the present days , after a mysterious accident , the reporter Ethan Kendrick ( Jason Behr ) recalls his meeting fifteen years ago with Jack ( Robert Forster ) , who owned an antique shop and told him that he was the one supposed to protect Sarah Daniels ( Amanda Brooks ) . Ethan seeks out Sarah and together they fight to survive and destroy the devilish dragon . " D-War " is a disappointing movie , with a lame story of the director and writer Hyung-rae Shim associated to a terrible acting of the unexpressive lead couple . The screenplay is ridiculous and boring , supported by reasonable special effects only and together with the art of the cover of the DVD , they are the best offered by this feature . Title ( Brazil ) : " D-War ? Guerra dos Dragões " ( " D-War ? War of Dragons " )
368894	2488512	396401	3.0	A Confused Screenplay and an Awful Lead Actress	First of all , this movie is so confused that it is almost impossible to summarize it , since I myself did not understand this horrible story . Further , the unknown cast , leaded by an actress called Laura Mennell , is simply awful . The expressions and screams of the character Sara Tobias are laughable and ridiculous , confusing grimaces with acting . Last but not the least , there are many favorable reviews about this flick in IMDb as follows : - Top Notch - Can't wait to see more of the directors work ? the author has only one review in IMDb on 24 September 2004 ; - Incredibly shot , amazingly intense ? the author has only one review in IMDb on 12 August 2004 ; - Not your typical blood and gore , in fact better . ? the author has only one review in IMDb on 13 February 2005 ; - As intense as Asian horror ! ! - the author has only one review in IMDb on 14 November 2004 . Coincidence ? Or are they the parents , relatives , friends or people hired by the production to promote this crap ? Title ( Brazil ) : " 11 . 11 ? A Nova Profecia " ( " 11 . 11 ? The New Prophecy " )
372428	2488512	964539	3.0	So Imbecilic and Absurd That Becomes Funny	Ted Grey ( Milo Ventimiglia ) is a brilliant medical student graduated in Harvard with a training period in Lagos , Africa , and a lovely fiancée , Gwen Williamson ( Alyssa Milano ) , from a wealthy and influent family . When he joins the Medical Center of the Metropolitan University for a residence in Pathology and Forensics , he becomes the pride and joy of his professor Dr . Quentin Morris ( John de Lancie ) ; however the star of the residence Jake Gallo ( Michael Weston ) becomes jealous with the newcomer . Nevertheless sooner he invites Ted to participate with four other residents in a deadly game , where each participant should commit the perfect crime without any clue of the " modus-operandi " of the murder , and the others investigate the corpse in the dungeon of the hospital . Further , Ted has wild sex with Jake's girlfriend and teammate of the game Juliette Bath ( Lauren Lee Smith ) . When Gwen decides to move to Ted's apartment , he decides to leave the group , but he finds resistance . " Patholog " is so imbecilic and absurd that becomes funny ; unfortunately the intention of the writers and the director is not a black-humor movie , but a suspenseful thriller with elements of horror . The plot begins with a citation of The Hippocratic Oath , and then there is a brief description of the curriculum-vitae of Ted Grey , but never a character development . Therefore , it is totally unreasonable his attitude joining the deranged Jake Gallo and his friends in a sick game . There is no explanation why a future doctor with his profile ? Harvard , experience overseas , gorgeous and wealthy fiancée ? would throw his future in the garbage for a dysfunctional resident that is not his friend ? actually he is his enemy . And how could the six residents frequently access the morgue for autopsies without any control from the staff of the hospital ? Title ( Brazil ) : " Autópsia de um Crime " ( " Autopsy of a Crime " )
371153	2488512	1321693	3.0	A Salad of Paradoxes	The mess goes on ? with less favorable reviews in IMDb this time . It is amazing how the incompetent " lost " writers of " Lost " have depleted the best TV series and turned into the most confused , paradoxical and incoherent story without resolving the mysteries of the previous seasons . ( I copied this sentence from my review of the last episode to complete the minimum ten lines required by IMDb ) . This season definitely does not have a storyline , and each week it is released repetitive pieces of paradoxical sequences to satisfy some smart fans of this series . It is impossible even to write a summary of this boring salad of paradoxes . Title ( Brazil ) : Not Available
371369	2488512	405296	3.0	Original , Messy and Boring	In a totalitarian society in a near future , the undercover detective Bob Arctor ( Keanu Reeves ) is working with a small time group of drug users trying to reach the big distributors of a brain-damaging drug called Substance D . His assignment is promoted by the recovery center New Path Corporation , and when Bob begins to lose his own identity and have schizophrenic behavior , he is submitted to tests to check his mental conditions . The adaptations of novels of Philip K . Dick to the cinema usually result in great movies : " Blade Runner ' , " Total Recall " , " Screamers " , " Impostor " , " Minority Report " and " Paycheck " . I have not read " A Scanner Darkly " , but based on the foregoing listed tales , I dare to write that probably the screenplay writer and director Richard Linklater spoiled a great novel in an original , but messy and boring adaptation to the cinema . The development of the story is very confused and the ending is pointless . Title ( Brazil ) : " O Homem Duplo " ( " The Double Man " )
368949	2488512	490240	3.0	Awful and Boring Collection of Clichés Combined With Bad Acting	A group of animal rights activists ? Jade ( Andrea Lui ) , Tim ( Dylan Taylor ) , Fix ( Andrew Hachey ) and the hacker Izzy ( Kristin Pellerin ) ? invades the complex of Chapel Pritchard to liberate subjects , with the support of the daughter of Dr . Woods ( Andrew Gillies ) , Ali ( Ellen Furey ) , and her boyfriend and security guard Chris ( Edward Furlong ) . Dr . Woods is in charge of an unsuccessful experiment for the cure of cancer in the facility , and when they use his access card . , the security system is activated . They try to escape using an elevator to the underground laboratory , and when the guards trap them , Izzy opens all the doors of the compound trying to provide a escape route for the group . However , she actually liberates an assassin mutant in the same floor as her friends and the guards . " Warriors of Terra " is an awful collection of clichés with a predictable story repeated in many B-movies with minor variations . The worst are the acting and the characters : Edward Furlong looks like a drugged junkie with a terrible face , in spite of performing a security guard ; Jade is a real bitch with her attitudes and Andrea Lui does not have a good performance ; Izzy makes grimaces trying to look like an intellectual hacker and Kristin Pellerin also does not have a good performance ; Ali makes all of this confusion to call the attention of her father , but Ellen Furey's acting is not bad ; Dr . Woods is absolutely unreasonable as a scientist , disclosing his secret experiment to a security guard ; Fix smokes marijuana while being chased by the security guards in a ridiculous attitude ; and Tim is also an unreasonable character . Do not waste your time watching this movie , you will have a sensation of Déjà vu ( for the worse ) . Title ( Brazil ) : " Mutação Assassina " ( " Assassin Mutation " )
371227	2488512	245356	3.0	Boring , Shallow , Artificial ? Looks a Sequel of the Awful " Prêt-à-Porter "	I bought this VHS attracted and curious by the beautiful and unknown Estella Warren , highlighted in the cover of the Brazilian VHS , and the long list of famous actors and actresses , including Sonia Braga . However , this movie proves that quantity will never mean quality ( only in " IMDb User Rating " ) ? " Perfume " is indeed a boring and shallow movie , with very artificial lines . This crap looks like a sequel of the awful Robert Altman's " Prêt-à-Porter " . The characters are not well developed , most of them only appear to give their names to the credits and create expectation of a good movie ; the storyline about the world fashion is terrible and ambitious ; and the awkward actress Leslie Mann , who plays one of the lead roles , has unpleasant and terrible tone of voice and corporal posture . Title ( Brazil ) : " Perfume "
370377	2488512	411705	4.0	Deceptive Sophisticated Porn	The structure of my reviews in IMDb usually begins with a summary of the plot in the first paragraph and my personal opinion in the next one . However , how to summarize " 9 Songs " using more than the storyline ? A man and a woman meet each other in a rock concert , and along the days they have sex , use drugs and go to rock and roll concerts . Michael Winterbottom , the director of the sensitive " Jude " ; the powerful " Welcome to Sarajevo " ; the original " I Want You " ; the dramatic " Wonderland " ; the intelligent " Code 46 " , among others good movies , seems to have decided to shoot porn . Using and abusing of the unknown actress Margo Stilley , who practices fellatio , masturbation , bondage and explicit sex in front of the camera , the story makes an analogy with the solitude of the Antarctica to give an intellectual appearance to the shallow , pointless and silly screenplay . I expected much more from such a great director , who should know that what happens inside four walls of a bedroom belongs to the lovers . Title ( Brazil ) : " 9 Canções " ( " 9 Songs " )
370313	2488512	51364	4.0	Silly Romance	In 1945 , while in a temporary assignment in London , the " The New York Standard " journalist Sara Scott ( Lana Turner ) has a torrid love affair with the reporter of BBC Mark Trevor ( Sean Connery ) and she falls in love for him . Just before the end of the war , they cover a sapper disassembling a bomb and Sara is informed that her boss and fiancé Carter Reynolds ( Barry Sullivan ) is coming to London to meet her . When she tells the news to Mark , he surprisingly discloses to her after three months of relationship that he is married and has a son in St . Giles , Cornwall , and he loves and will stay with his family . Mark leaves Sara and travels to Paris with his assistant Alan Thompson ( Terence Longdon ) , but the plane crashes and he dies . The grieving Sara has a nervous breakdown and is interned in the Headway Nursing Home for treatment . Six weeks later , Carter buys a ship trip to her from Plymouth to New York ; however , Sara decides to visit St . Giles by train before returning to her country . When she meets Mark's wife Kay Trevor ( Glynis Johns ) and his son Brian ( Martin Stephens ) , she is invited by Kay to stay with them until the next morning . During the night , Sara has a crisis , faints and Kay invites her to stay at her home during for recovering . The silly " Another Time , Another Place " is an unconvincing romance , with a laughable screenplay . The story begins without a previous development of characters , but sooner the viewer understands that Sara is an experienced American correspondent that writes a column for her newspaper and is engaged of her boss . Mark is a married man that broadcasts news about the war and is having an affair with Sara , and disapproved by his friend and assistant Alan . When Sara tells that her fiancé is coming to London , Mark decides to end his affair since he loves his family . This revelation , associated to the shock of the death of Mark lead Sara to a breakdown . Up to this point , the story is convincing and I have no remarks . However , the decision of Sara to travel to St . Giles is the beginning of an unthinkable attitude of an experienced woman living overseas . The rest of this forgettable movie is pure crap with a corny conclusion , despite the good performance of Glynis Johns and the magnificent locations in Cornwall . Title ( Brazil ) : " Vítima de uma Paixão " ( " Victim of a Passion " )
369796	2488512	59887	4.0	So Cheesy and Silly that Becomes Funny	In 2020 , after the colonization of the moon , the spaceships Vega , Sirius and Capella are launched from Lunar Station 7 to explore Venus under the command of Professor Hartman ( Basil Rathbone ) , but an asteroid collides and explodes Capella . The leader ship Vega stays orbiting and sends the astronauts Kern ( Georg Tejkh ) and Sherman ( Yuri Sarantsev ) with the robot John ( John Bix ) to the surface of Venus , but they have problems with communication with Dr . Marsha Evans ( Faith Domergue ) in Vega . The Sirius lands in Venus and Commander Brendan Lockhart ( Vladimir Yemelyanov ) , Andre Ferneau ( Robert Chantal ) and Hans Walter ( Georgi Zhzhyonov ) explore the planet and are attacked by prehistoric animals . They use a vehicle to seek Kern and Sherman while collecting samples from the planet . Meanwhile John helps the two cosmonauts to survive in the hostile land . " Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet " is so cheesy and silly that becomes funny . The effects are awful even for a 1965 movie , and the dialogs are very poor . Maybe the director and writer wrote this story and these lines in the elementary school so ridicule they are , specially the lines spoken by scientists . Title ( Brazil ) : " O Planeta Pré-Histórico " ( " The Prehistoric Planet " )
372244	2488512	350232	4.0	Predictable and Forgettable With a Deceptive Ambiguous Conclusion	The graduation student Mark ( Daniel Gillies ) is developing a monograph work about contemporary myths , and he interviews the psychiatrist Dr . Theodore Rosen ( Kurtwood Smith ) , who was treating Carl Bryce ( Jeff Galpin ) , a deranged teenager that killed his parents twenty years ago . The body of Carl has never been found and there is an urban legend that the spot is a cursed place since slavery times , causing madness and death to those that trespass the area . Mark invites his friends Eric ( Jeff Davis ) , Tyler ( Clayne Crawford ) , Kristy Goodman ( Estella Warren ) and Sharon ( Ashley Scott ) to help him in his research in the old real estate . Once there , a mysterious killer starts to execute and chase the group , with the survivors trying to escape alive . " Trespassing " is a predictable and forgettable low-budget movie , with a promising beginning and a deceptive ambiguous conclusion . The story is another rip-off of " The Texas Chainsaw Massacre " , but with an awful handy cam that shacks and trembles the images , most of them too close and without permitting to see the surroundings . Ashley Scott performs the annoying and totally incoherent character Sharon , taking the worst possible attitudes under stress . The conclusion is ridiculous , probably with the intention of a sequel . Title ( Brazil ) : " Invasão Mortal " ( " Mortal Invasion " )
370609	2488512	499603	4.0	Pointless and Disappointing	A still famous but decadent actor ( Morgan Freeman ) has not filmed for four years . When he is invited to participate in a new project , he asks the clumsy cousin of the director to drop him in a poor Latin neighborhood in Carlson to research the work of the manager of a small supermarket . He sees the gorgeous Spanish cashier Scarlet ( Paz Vega ) and he becomes attracted with her ability . His driver never returns to catch him and Scarlet gives a ride to the actor . But first she has a job interview for the position of secretary in a construction company and the actor helps her to be prepared ; then they spend the afternoon together having a pleasant time . I am a big fan of Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega . However , the pointless " 10 Items or Less " is absolutely disappointing . This low-budget movie does not seem to have a storyline , and is supported by the chemistry and improvisations of Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega and actually nothing happens along 82 minutes . The ambiguous open conclusion is simply ridiculous , with the character of Morgan Freeman returning to his silver spoon world and telling the simple worker that they would never see each other again . Was he afraid to have a love affair with her and destroy his perfect world with his family ? Or was a clash of classes , and he realizes that his fancy neighborhood would not be adequate to a simple worker from the lower classes ? Title ( Brazil ) : " Um Astro em Minha Vida " ( " A Star in My Life " )
369637	2488512	792948	5.0	Pointless and Pretentious Eroticism and Voyeurism	The French filmmaker François ( Frédéric van den Driessche ) decides to make a movie about female pleasure and break of taboos in sex . He interviews many young women about their secret fantasies and proposes auditions , with each woman naked and masturbating in front of a camera until they reach orgasm . He finally casts Julie ( Lise Bellynck ) , the unstable Charlotte ( Maroussia Dubreuil ) and the compulsive liar Stéphanie ( Marie Allan ) to the lead roles and creates a sexual tension among them in a threesome . The relationship with the three actresses affects his marriage , while two fallen angels and the spirit of his protective grandmother follow him . " Les Anges Exterminateurs " is a pointless and pretentious soft-porn with lots of eroticism and voyeurism . The movie is pure exploitation , with the exposition of the gorgeous unknown naked actresses , and disguised of " art-movie " with the beautiful cinematography and the omnipresence of two fallen angels which existence is never explained and the ghost of the director's grandmother . It is funny to see intellectual explanations to such a silly and messy story of female orgasm . Title ( Brazil ) : " Anjos Exterminadores " ( " Exterminating Angels " )
368897	2488512	390450	5.0	" Rosemary's Baby " and " Godsend " Cloning	The low middle class and young school teacher Samantha ( Heather Graham ) and her husband , the unknown writer Craig Howard ( James Purefoy ) , move to an insemination clinic in Lakeview , a small town two hours far from New York City , for a free insemination treatment in the " Spiritus Reasearch Clinic " . Samantha gets pregnant of twins and the life of the couple economically improve with the unexpected success of the book of Craig . However , Samantha notes that a hooded stranger is stalking her , and she becomes paranoid when she realizes that the place is indeed a cloning clinic and she was impregnated with the devil's seed . Yesterday , when I saw " Blessed " , I felt myself in a " déjà vu " situation , with the feeling that I have already seen this movie before , which is indeed a clone of " Rosemary's Baby " and " Godsend " . There is nothing new in this plagiarized screenplay , which is dedicated to the memory of David Hemmings . This great British actor deserves a better homage to his name than this non-original story . Title ( Brazil ) : Not Available
370641	2488512	854161	5.0	Disappointing : Extremely Silly and Gross	The idealistic lawyer Botelho Pinto ( Murilo Benício ) is suing the powerful Tabajara Organizations with his secretary Priscila Tsunami ( Maria Paula ) using the testimony of Lindauro das Dores ( Bussunda ) , who had been evicted and fired , and accepted a job offer as a subject of an experiment of a new pill developed by the Tabajara Organizations . The pill Borogodol proposes to seduce women , no matter how ugly or clumsy the man might be , but as a side effect it also attracts dogs like a female heat . When Lindauro dies in an accident with an elephant in the zoo , Priscila meets another man that had troubles with a belt from the Tabajara Organizations . Meanwhile Botelho tells Pricila why he has problems with the Tabajara Organizations . When the golden fish of the judge of the case is kidnapped , Botelho and Priscila seek the pet and the lawyer accidentally meets his missing father . " Seus Problemas Acabaram ! ! ! " is very disappointing . I have bought this DVD with great expectation of a funny movie , but I found it extremely silly and gross . The intellectual level of the jokes recalled my period of elementary school , so dreadful most of them are . The best moments in this film belong to the sexy Maria Paula that shows an awesome shape after the delivery in June 2004 and her character is really erotic and funny . For viewers overseas , this movie does not make sense since most of the jokes are related to Brazilian pop-culture . Title ( Brazil ) : " Seus Problemas Acabaram ! ! ! " ( " Your Problems Have Finished ! ! ! " )
372036	2488512	389790	5.0	Silly with an Absurd Storyline	When the bee Barry B . Benson graduates from college , he finds that will have only one job for his entire life , and absolutely disappointed , he joins the team responsible for bringing the honey and pollination of the flowers to visit the world outside the hive . Once in Manhattan , he is saved by the florist Vanessa and he breaks the bee law to thank Vanessa . The become friends and Barry discovers that humans explore bees to sell the honey they produce . Barry decides to sue the human race , with destructive consequences to nature . " Bee Movie " has a great animation , but unfortunately is silly with an absurd storyline . I do not understand what the writer might have in his mind with such lack of message ; maybe a child could have written a better and more intelligent plot . The lead character in funny but has an annoying voice . I love animations , especially those with good messages . However , is so inaccurate and stupid that even for children I believe this movie does not work well . Title ( Brazil ) : " Bee Movie ? A História de Uma Abelha " ( " Bee Movie ? The Story of a Bee " )
369488	2488512	451957	5.0	Predictable and Forgettable	Samantha Owens ( Mara ) is the editor of the high school newspaper and was blacklisted with her two friends , Gina ( Haley McCormick ) and Mindy ( Olesya Rulin ) , by the football players after an article about them , so they do not go to a high school party . Samantha tells to the other girls an urban legend told by her mother : in 1969 , in Salt Lake City , the two girlfriends of Mary Banner ( Lilith Fields ) are drugged by their dates in a prom , but she understands the situation and runs from her date , who kills her and hide her body in a trunk in the basement of the school . Like the Candyman , Samantha speaks " Bloody Mary " three times , evoking the evil spirit of Mary . Along the night , the three girls are drugged and kidnapped in a prank of the players , but Samantha has visions and premonitions about Mary . When her school mates are killed , Mary visits Grace Taylor ( Tina Lifford ) , one of the girls abused in 1969 , and finds that the victims are the descendants of the trio that killed Mary and harmed her friends , and that Mary spirit is seeking for revenge . I bought this DVD full of good expectations , based on the name of director Mary Lambert , since " Pet Sematary " is one of my favorite horror movies ever . Unfortunately , the predictable and forgettable story of " Urban Legends : Bloody Mary " is very bad and full of clichés . Mary crawling from the bottom of the bed is a rip-off of Samara in " The Ring " . It seems that there is only some care with the gore deaths , but the same does not happen with the characters . For example , Samantha's mother Pam ( Nancy Everhard ) , who told the story of Mary to Samantha , vanishes and Samantha and David never ask for additional information about Mary to her . David is stupidly killed and Samantha in the end of the story with Grace does not miss or even mention him . The death of Heather Thompson , attacked by spiders , is the best moment of this disappointing flick . Title ( Brazil ) : " Lendas Urbanas 3 : A Vingança de Mary " ( " Urban Legends 3 : Mary's Revenge " )
371607	2488512	842929	5.0	Pointless Alienation	The teenager and skateboarder Alex ( Gabe Nevins ) is interviewed by Detective Richard Lu ( Daniel Liu ) that is investigating the death of a security guard in the rail yards severed by a train that was apparently hit by a skate board . While dealing with the separation process of his parents and the sexual heat of his virgin girlfriend Jennifer ( Taylon Momsen ) , Alex writes his last experiences in Paranoid Park with his new acquaintances and how the guard was killed , trying to relieve his feeling of guilty from his conscience . " Paranoid Park " is a disappointing movie of director Gus Van Sant . Like in " Elephant " , Gus discloses the alienation of the youths through the accidental death of a security guard , showing how the killer deals with his guilty following the advice of his friend and easily resolves his issues showing no remorse . But the story is too short and and maybe more adequate for a short . For a feature , it is pointless going nowhere along 85 minutes . Title ( Brazil ) : " Paranoid Park "
369027	2488512	41842	5.0	To Make the Viewers Become Vegetarian	In the periphery of Paris , the fate of horses , cows and other animals in a slaughterhouse is detailed in this short documentary . My first comment about this disgusting short is that fortunately it is not in color . I believe that there are two possible views of this short : technically , my opinion is that it is perfect . The shootings of Paris , the cinematography , the camera , the skill of the workers , in this regard everything is perfectly shown . However , the theme is simply awful and of a completely bad taste . I do not know if George Franju was vegetarian , but probably his intention showing the slaughter of animals , inclusive of an offspring , was to make the viewers become vegetarian . I believe most of the pseudo-intellectual readers will not like my review , but that was my impression of this documentary . Title ( Brazil ) : " O Sangue das Bestas " ( " The Blood of the Beasts " )
369167	2488512	539394	5.0	The Return of Barbas , the Demon of Fear	A hit-woman tries to kill the Halliwell sisters on Friday , 13th , shooting their house but she dies when Prue protects herself and her sisters from the bullets . They find that she was Ms . Hellfire , and Prue goes undercover to investigate why a mortal woman wished to kill them . Prue discloses that she was hired by the gangster Bane Jessup , who associated to the Demon of Fear Barbas , to kill the Halliwell sisters and other witches before midnight . In " Ms . Hellfire " , Barbas returns but is again vanquished by the Halliwell sisters . Prue develops the ability of astral projection and the sisters disclose to Darryl Morris that they are good witches . I do not know how Prue was able to get the fortune of Ms . Hellfire to Buckland's Auction House . The silly Marcie Stedwell is annoying , and this episode is very weak . Title ( Brazil ) : " A Sra .

369396	2488512	418763	5.0	Distant From the War	In 1989 , when Iraq invaded Kuwait , the USA sent countless troops to Middle East deserts to combat Saddam Hussein army . " Jarhead " is based on a book written by one Marine , who joined this force due to lack of professional options , since he was not able to go to college . This movie shows the Marine Corp trained by stupid and sadistic leaders , and the troop completely alienated , in a war without seeing the enemy , or knows the country or the costumes of the locals , and even the reasons for their action , being trained like pawns , aiming to kill an enemy . I do not know the reality of the Marines , but the way the story is presented it is not compatible with the worldwide image they have , mostly due to Hollywood movies . I was a little disappointed with director Sam Mendes , after " American Beauty " ( 1999 ) and " Road to Perdition " ( 2002 ) . With the usual interval of three years to make a movie , he should have selected a better screenplay . Title ( Brazil ) : " Soldado Anônimo " ( " Anonymous Soldier " )
369410	2488512	994365	6.0	Good Acting , Intriguing but Flawed Plot	While flying to the supply vessel through a storm with Frank following the instructions of Faraday , Desmond loses conscience and his mind returns to 1996 , when he joined the Scottish Army . When he awakes in the present , he has no recollections from Sayid or the last years in the island . Sayid calls Faraday and he ask Desmond to visit him in Oxford with some key information to prove their contact in the future . In 1996 , Faraday asks Desmond to find a constant in both periods and Desmond visits Penny and asks her phone number , promising to call her eight years later . " The Constant " has good acting with an intriguing but flawed plot . There is an absolute lack of coherence in the story with the time travel of Desmond and his meeting with Daniel Faraday in the past . The resolution with Faraday finding a reference in his journal is absolutely predictable but never satisfactory , since an important encounter like that should bring recollections to Faraday even having memory problems , and not just a reference in his diary . I noted that many viewers enjoyed and worshiped this episode , but in my opinion it is overrated . Title ( Brazil ) : Not Available
370402	2488512	405061	6.0	Scary Story , Deceptive End	Joey Cheng ( Qi Shu ) attempts to suicide using an overdose of sleeping pills , when her boyfriend breaks up with her . However , she is saved by the staff of the hotel and from this moment on , she has visions of dead people . When she finds that she is pregnant , she decides to have the baby and protect him against the frightening ghosts . " Jian gui " is one of my favorite horror movies , and " Jian gui 2 " has also a very scary story , with one of the strongest scenes I have ever seen . Although having the same title , this movie is not a sequel of " Jian gui " . Unfortunately , the deceptive end is completely related to the Buddhist beliefs of reincarnation and too much straight for my taste . I was expecting for some last scary surprising scene , but I was completely disappointed with the correctness of the conclusion . The beauty of Qi Shu , an actress unknown for us Westerns , with her thick lips is amazing and a great attraction . Title ( Brazil ) : " Visões " ( " Visions " )

They disclose that humans had been abducted three hundred years ago to slave work , but they have reverted the situation and killed most of the Skags . The alien survivors presently does not have right to education and they a loathed by most of the population . When Archer and the teacher Bethany are arrested for teaching Skags , he decides to interfere in the society . " North Star " is so far the most inconsistent and the worst episode of this Third Season . The story is not original , and Archer violates the principle of not interfering in other societies . Further , the writer shamefully forgets the " Father of Aviation " Alberto Santos-Dumont , the first man to build and fly experimental aircraft , giving the credit to the Wright Brothers . Maybe a side effect of the Delphic Expanse . Title ( Brazil ) : " Estrela Polar " ( " North Star " )

This low-budget movie is a dramatization of this deplorable event , based on the report of one of the survivors of the ' day after ' of Nagasaki . Tomorrow is the sad anniversary of this massacre and I decided to see this movie for the first time . Unfortunately , the quality of the image of the Brazilian VHS is not good .

The showgirl Arlete ( Sonia Mamede ) and her smalltime crook boyfriend decide to steal the money from the naive Felismino , plotting a scheme with a fake murder and then blackmailing Felismino . When his greedy family finds that her earned the prize , his wife and his mother-in-law decide to spend the money in luxury . Meanwhile , his smart niece Sueli ( Miriam Teresa ) discloses the fraud and she is kidnapped by the bandit . This chanchada is delightfully naive and silly , but has action and many funny lines , specially for Brazilians . Following the standard of this popular Brazilian musical comedy of the 40's and 50's , there are many critics hidden in the jokes that are still valid in 2007 . The civil servant awarded with a huge prize just because he is never absent of his work ; when he believes that the police is chasing him , he comments that he does not have parliamentary immunity ; the consumption dream of the financially repressed middle-class , these are only some samples of a sharp criticism to the ethics and behavior of our society . Unfortunately the VHS released in Brazil has troubles with the sound in many parts , being impossible to understand many dialogs .

He gets a bootleg tape of his idol Bob Dylan from the host ( Kiefer Sutherland ) , a kiss from a beautiful girl he met in the party , Maya ( Uma Thurman ) and a news in the end : that night , his father had left his mother . This short story seems to be the experience of probably some important person in Hollywood when he was young . It is very personal . It is about a very special night of a teenager , an ' asshole ' in the eyes of the girls as mentioned by Rich to Maya , who goes to a party , makes success with a beautiful girl , gets a great gift and receives unpleasant news .
371075	2488512	113303	6.0	He Comes Back to Life With Another Vision	While traveling on the road with his wife Lindsay ( Christine Lahti ) and his daughter Regina ( Alicia Silverstone ) , Hatch Harrison ( Jeff Goldblum ) has a car accident , hitting a truck and falling with his wife in a river . He dies for more than two hours , but the specialist Dr . Jonas Nyebern ( Alfred Molina ) successfully brings him back to life . Hatch has some weird premonitions and becomes able to see through the eyes of the psychopath serial killer Vassago ( Jeremy Sisto ) , a young man that killed his mother and his sister and committed suicide and was also brought back to life and now is killing young women and teenagers . When he foresees that Vassago is trying to capture his daughter , Hatch tries to find the criminal first , in spite of Lindsay , Regina and the detective in charge of the investigation believe that he needs psychiatric help . " Hideaway " is another rip-off of " Eye of Laura Mars " , I believe the first movie to explore the idea of a person connected to a serial killer through his eyes . " Hideaway " has a good cinematography and special affects , the cast is great and the sequence of the accident of Hatch and Lindsay is excellent . Although not being an original storyline , this attractive movie entertains . Title ( Brazil ) : " O Esconderijo " ( " The Hiding Place " )

One day , Shaun finds a book from the writer and professor Marcus Skinner ( Kevin Kline ) and after reading it , decides to go to Stanford to become a writer . However , the stupid clerk Charlotte Cobb ( Lily Tomlin ) makes a mistake with his name and forwards the record of the bad student Shane to Stanford instead of Shaun's . His application is not accepted and Shaun tries different approaches to reach his objective and study in Stanford . This comedy has some good moments and has some funny parts , especially when Jack Black's shallow character is in action . I do not know the educational system in USA , but it sounds strange to me that a donation can put a student with bad grades in a university . I am used to see in American movies , dumb athletes joining the university due to the skills in football , baseball , basketball or volley , but this is the first time that I see money buying a spot in a reputable university .

When Django is betrayed , he steals the gold from Hugo and is helped by Maria . They are chased by Hugo and his men , while Jackson organizes with the Mexican army to trap Hugo . The originality of the beginning of " Django " is simply fantastic , with a lonely man dragging a mysterious coffin along desert lands and saving a woman from sadistic criminals . When the mystery is disclosed , it is very funny to see the confrontation of Django against forty-eight " bad guys " . The story follows captivating , with the usual pattern of spaghetti-western , but the scene when the accomplice of Hugo hits successively times the hands of Django with a rifle is exaggerated and spoils the rest of the movie . The DVD released in Brazil does not have the original Italian audio , only dubbed in English or Portuguese . Title ( Brazil ) : " Django "

One day , Zak finds by accident a watch developed by Earl Dopler ( French Stewart ) , a former student of Dr . Gibbs , with capability of accelerating time . Henry Gates ( Michael Biehn ) , the villain of the story , stole this research and wants to make lots of money with this device . Zak and Francesca will face lots of adventures due to this finding . The screenplay of this film has lots of flaw , but anyway it entertains . There are lots of inconsistency in the story , but if the viewer do not pay attention to these details , may have some fun . The special effects are very reasonable . Teenagers are certainly the public-target of this movie .

Meanwhile , two seniors students from the frat house have prepared pranks in the house to scare the sorority pledges . But the evil spirit of Professor Kapps possesses Doug , slashing the group of students that have to fight to survive . " The Hazing " was a good surprise . I was expecting a bad horror movie , but actually it is good and funny , and entertains . Even the gore scenes are hilarious , and in spite of not having exceptional performances , the cast is nice . There are many beautiful women naked , gore , and lots of humor , following the pattern of 1986 " House " , " Vamp " , " Frankenhooker " , " Idle Hands " , " Evil Dead " and many other flicks .

He tries to gather evidences that his son is alive and is a ' pow ' ( prisoner of war ) . He does not convince Washington and decides to reunite other veteran ex-militaries and organize a raid in the field in Laos where Frank is supposed to be arrested . With the financial support of MacGregor ( Robert Stack ) , a wealthy father in the same situation as Rhodes , they prepare a small but experienced team for the action . First of all , I do not like this type of movie . It offends my intelligence . The usual arithmetic works this way : the life of Blaster + Sailor + two Asians > the freedom of four deranged and very sick prisoners . Further , having such soldiers like presented in movies like that , how Americans lost the Vietnam war ? Anyway , the action is great and entertains and at least the author made a decent end .

369852	2488512	365737	6.0	Confused , Ambitious and Complex Collection of Clichés	Syriana is a confused , ambitious and complex thriller of corruption and power related to the oil industry that tells four parallel stories : the CIA agent Bob Barnes ( George Clooney ) with great experience in Middle East that falls in disgrace after an unsuccessful mission dealing missiles in Lebanese Republic ; the investigation of the attorney Bennett Holiday ( Jeffrey Wright ) related to the merge of two American oil companies , Connex and Killen ; the traumatic association of the energy analyst Bryan Woodman ( Matt Damon ) with the son of a powerful emir of Iran ; and the social drama of the Pakistani immigrant worker Wasim Khan ( Mazhar Munir ) that is fired by the oil company . The greatest problem with this movie is that it is too complex for only 126 minutes running time , due to the number of plots , subplots and characters ; therefore its edition is tremendously confused with the use of many ellipsis . It would be more appropriated a mini-series , or a longer film . Even the title of this movie is very ambiguous , with many non-official explanations . The movie's website states that " ' Syriana ' is a very real term used by Washington think-tanks to describe a hypothetical reshaping of the Middle East . " ( http syrianamovie warnerbros com about html ) In the end , I truly found this movie a pretentious and sophisticated collection of clichés sold in a beautiful " package " . Title ( Brazil ) : " Syriana ? A Indústria do Petróleo " ( " Syriana ? The Oil Industry " )

Brad and Zeke are greater lovers and Jonathan loves to self-masturbate . One day , each one of them tells the others that have met the perfect girl . Indeed , they come to realize that the girl is the same , Mia ( Amanda Peet ) . A great dispute among them will shake their friendship . A funny surprising end will conclude the plot . This is a film that looks like that is based on the teenagers of ' American Pie ' , when they have grown up . The ' low level ' and scatological jokes , the concept of relationship with a woman , the focus on sex , the entire screenplay seems to be ' inspired ' in ' American Pie ' . However , it has many funny moments and will certainly entertain the fans of movies like ? ' American Pie ' .

Rudy finds a weird box in the basement , and brings it to the living room . Dora opens it and an evil force is released . Rudy is possessed by the unleashed devil , threatening his friends along a night of horror . I do not know whether this Vince Di Meglio wants to remake or to pay a tribute to Sam Raimi's ' Evil Dead ' , but I did not see the name of this great director in the credits . Therefore , I believe that ' Deadfall ' is indeed a plagiarism of that masterpiece of horror . Anyway , there are good effects and in the end this is a watchable movie .

369057	2488512	382625	7.0	Reasonable Adaptation	While in Paris for a lecture , the specialist in symbols , Robert Langdon ( Tom Hanks ) , is called on to the Louvre by Captain Bezu Fache ( Jean Reno ) to help the investigation of the murder of the curator Jacques Saunière ( Jean-Pierre Marielle ) . Before dying , Saunière wrote codes , symbols , a pentagram and a Fibonacci number sequence inclusive using his own blood . Sooner Saunière's granddaughter , the cryptologist Sophie Neveu ( Audrey Tautou ) arrives with a message to Langdon , advising him that he is in danger and suspect for the murder of Saunière . Langdon and Sophie join their knowledge and follow leads to one of the greatest secrets of mankind history , the descendants of Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene . The novel and bestseller of Dan Brown was one of the most intriguing books that I had read about a couple of years ago . I was curious about the adaptation to the cinema of this complex and detailed story , and I found it only reasonable , with beautiful locations and a total lack of emotions . The cast uses great names , but first of all the physical appearances of Robert Langdon , the " red haired " Sophie Neveu and the " strong black " Bezu Fache do not correspond with the description of the characters in the novel . Further , Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou do not show any chemistry , but the always excellent Paul Bettany is perfect performing Silas . Of course there are simplifications in the story , it would be impossible to translate all the subplots to the screenplay , but I still found the movie quite confused and presenting too much information to be followed by a viewer that has not read the book . In the end , " The Da Vinci Code " frustrated my expectations . Title ( Brazil ) : " O Código Da Vinci " ( " The Da Vinci Code " )

He began the shootings submitting himself to a complete check-up with three doctors , and along the weeks , he compared his weight and results of exams , coming through a scary conclusion . Only today I have watched this famous documentary , and I am really impressed with the courage and determination of Morgan Spurlock , being subjected to such experiment to prove how noxious fast foods are . This documentary is so important that McDonald's changed their menu worldwide , including some juices and salads . I found also amazing the sizes available in USA , since in Brazil , for example , the largest size of coke corresponds to the medium one showed in the film . The same happens with French fries . This documentary should be mandatory in schools . Title ( Brazil ) : " Super Size Me , A Dieta do Palhaço " ( " Super Size Me , The Diet of the Clown " )

When they are attacked by the carnivorous creeping plants , they understand the reaction of the Mayan villagers . " The Ruins " is an original horror movie , with a different and creepy story , good performances of the young cast and great special effects . The beauty of Laura Ramsey is impressive , and the great actress Jena Malone performs an annoying character . The scene of the amputation of Mathias legs is extremely gore and gruesome .

Clayton does not believe in what he has seen and heard , but when Gayle gets mysteriously sick and Dr . Clayton becomes the prime suspect of David and the locals , he finally accepts that his brother is a vampire and tries to find his coffin to destroy him . " Dead Man Walk " is a creepy low-budget vampire movie visibly inspired in " Dracula " , with a good story and acting . The cinematography of the DVD that I watched is a kind of blurred in the scenes in the cemetery , maybe because of a lighting problem in the shot , but the story is told in a dark atmosphere and I liked this underrated film . George Zucco has great performance in his double role . Title ( Brazil ) : " Mortos Que Andam " ( " Dead That Walk " )

Ann Grant ( Claire Danes ) is welcomed by Lila's alcoholic and reckless brother Buddy ( Hugh Dancy ) in the Wittenborn's cottage at seaside and he tells her that his sister is in love actually for their friend and servant Harris Arden ( Patrick Wilson ) , who fought in the war and has graduated in medicine . Later the bride-to-be confesses her true feelings about Harris to Ann . However , when Ann meets Harris , she has a crush on him and they have a brief affair during one night stand while a tragedy happens with Buddy . Meanwhile Ann's daughters , the insecure and unstable Nina Mars ( Toni Collette ) and the happy wife and mother Constance Haverford ( Natasha Richardson ) , are worried with their mother and have differences to be resolved . " Evening " has one of the best feminine casts I have ever seen in a movie , with magnificent performances . The resemblance of the stunning Mamie Gummer with her mother Meryl Streep is amazing and she has a performance that honors the name of her mother . The locations , costumes , set decoration , cinematography and soundtrack are also awesome . Unfortunately the plot is confused and I have not clearly understood the message of this film . Why motherhood is so important in the story ? Was Constance engendered in the night stand of Ann and Harris and he would be her father ? Why Ann and Harris have not stayed together , if the guy really loved her like he confesses in their occasional encounter in New York ? Which issues Ann Lord has resolved after the visit of Lila Ross ? Was Buddy Wittenborn bisexual or his love for Harris was a fraternal love ? Why Nina Mars changed her thoughts about motherhood in the end ? It seems that the screenplay writers or the director failed since they were not able to make sense and fulfillment to the beautiful love story .

This theme has been approached in many other movies , and I personally like 1963 " Vidas Secas " very much , but in " Morte e Vida Severina " , the story is told through poetry and songs . The author makes an analogy between the animals and the river that flows to the sea with the migrants that also moves to the big city nearby the sea , and he remarks that only the rocks stay in the drought . Unfortunately the sound of this movie is not good , and it is very difficult to understand some parts due to the strong accent of the interviewed migrants .

However , Otto ( Ronald Nitschke ) , the former husband of Maria , threatens and blackmails her , affecting the personal life and the professional performance of Leonard , culminating in a difficult situation for him . " The Innocent " is a surprisingly good love story in times of cold war . While in " Casablanca " the elegant Rick Blaine spontaneously sacrifices his love for Ilsa Lund Laszlo in a noble situation , in " The Innocent " we see a sacrifice of a love provoked by a dirty and nasty situation . However , this movie has action , love , black humor and suspense and is a worthwhile entertainment . Title ( Brazil ) : " O Inocente " ( " The Innocent " )

She is abducted and while pursuing her , many erotic tales are told to him . This Pasolini's version of ' Arabian Nights ' is very reasonable , but I do not understand how this movie won a special prize in Cannes 1974 . In my opinion , it is a forgettable film , highly recommended for the gay community due to the quantity of scenes with frontal male nudity , but which deserves to be watched once , because of the ' trademark ' Pasolini . The location where it was filmed is the best this movie can offer . In Brazil , this movie is not available on VHS or DVD ; I saw it yesterday , on cable television , in a Pasolini's festival along this week . Title ( Brazil ) : ' As 1001 Noites de Pasolini ' ( ' The 1001 Nights of Pasolini ) '

The adventure mixes the apocalyptic society of Mad Max and Waterworld with dragons and entertains . The special effects work on DVD .

The little girl that " vanished " for her parents is a great critics to the behavior of most families . The hypocrisy of the justice , reflected in the segment of the sniper .

Emma Watson , in the role of Hermion Granger , has another excellent performance . It is funny to see how the cast grew and changed in a couple of years . However , this movie is a great entertainment and does not disappoint . Title ( Brazil ) : " Harry Potter e o Prisioneiro de Azkaban " ( " Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban "

372392	2488512	893356	9.0	The Fresh-Blood Colored Flag of the Rising Sun	In 1937 , the Japanese army invades China in a cruel war and after the fall of Shanghai , the soldiers head to the capital Nanking . A group of Western foreigners led by John Rabe , Minnie Vautrin , Bob Wilson and George Fitch create the Safety Zone , a sanctuary that was not bombed by the Japanese airplanes , to protect thousands of refugees . While the Japanese soldiers reach the town on 13 December 1937 , raping , slaughtering and pillaging the civilian , the heroic group of Westerns defends the lives of about 250 , 000 Chinese sacrificing their own freedom , and succeeds to tell the world the crimes of war committed by the Japanese army in Nanking . The harrowing , heartbreaking and awesome " Nanking " retells the story of the genocide in Nanking in 1937 promoted by the Japanese army . In the late 90's I saw the also impressive and disturbing " Nanjing 1937 " ( a . k . a . " Don't Cry , Nanking " ) and I confess that was the first time I heard anything about this massacre . In the movie " Shake Hands with the Devil " , the Canadian General Romeo Dellaire has a fantastic line when he says that " genocide is when there are cargo train , concentration camps , gas chambers " . In Hollywood , usually genocide is associated to the Jews in World War II and there are dozens of excellent movies about this dark period of the contemporary history . " Nanking " uses letters and other documents written mainly by the group of Westerns that created the Safety Zone in touching and emotional lectures of great actors and actresses ; disturbing and heartbreaking testimonies of survivors ; a great number of footages , in a magnificent work of research ; and the wonderful music score of Kronos Quartet . I immediately associated how traumatic might have been the lives of these survivors after witnessing such cruel crimes of war . Further , in Nanking there were Westerns observers that told the world part of what happened in the city ; imagine in Shanghai and in the minor towns in the countryside on the way of the Japanese troops without foreign witnesses how violent these soldiers might have been with the population . These group of expatriated shows the difference that an individual can make . I was really disturbed and sad after watching this fantastic movie . Title ( Brazil ) : Not Available

In " Good Fences " , the impressive fate of Sara is disclosed to Lincoln and I confess that I did not expect such violent twist in the story . Mahone has lost for his addiction and now he is consuming heroin . Michael lures Lechero and now he can count with Sucre's support . Bellick is probably the most despicable character of this series and T-Bag is indeed a deranged cold blood killer . Just as a curiosity , the soccer game between Fluminense versus Grêmio showed in Lechero's television happened in 1996 , the year that the player Mauro Galvão played in Grêmio .

There are many moments of truth in this episode centered in Sun , like when she finds who the father of her baby is or the secret about Jin's mother . The evil Juliet may hate Ben , but I believe I hate this despicable woman most . Unfortunately Sayid is not in the group leaded by Desmond to " take care " of Mikhail ; I believe Desmond will regret his decision .

Once in New York , things do not happen as planned . " Maria Full of Grace " is a very powerful and real movie about the lack of perspective in the life of teenagers in poor countries .

Once there , the poor adolescent sees a chance to join to the American Dream and give a better life to her unborn child and make money to send to her family .

However , Yasmin meets Ahmed ( Rudolph Valentino ) , who is the Sheik's son but she does not know , and they fall in love for each other . When the young couple secretly dates in the ruins of Touggourt , where Yasmin dances , the criminals attack Ahmed , beat up and capture him , expecting to ask for a ransom . Ghobah poisons Ahmed , telling that Yasmin is a bait to lure victims for them . Ahmed escapes , and he abducts Yasmin and despises her . When he knows the truth , he fights against the gang of criminals trying to rescue her from Ghobah . " The Son of the Sheik " is the last movie of Rudolph Valentino and a delightful adventure with romance , action and drama . The cinematography is impressive , and I particularly liked very much the sequences when Vilma Banky dances in Touggourt beginning with a close and opening to the whole place , and when Ahmed chases Ghobah and Yasmin in the desert . Considering the equipment available in 1926 , big , heavy and with serious limitations , it is amazing how these scenes were shot . Rudolph Valentino is fantastic in the role of the son of the Sheik , and his agility recalled me Errol Flynn , when he fights in the bar of Touggourt , jumping on the chandelier . The beautiful Vilma Banky dances magnificently well , shows a great chemistry with Rudolph Valentino and has also a great interpretation . The intense music of Arthur Gutmann gives a perfect dynamic to this wonderful underrated film . Title ( Brazil ) : " O Filho do Sheik " ( " The Son of the Sheik " )

" De Vento em Popa " is a delightfully naive and funny comedy in the present days , but still a marvelous entertainment . The story and the situations are hilarious , making the viewer laugh and cry , and Sonia Mamede and Oscarito are amazing in the role of a talented double from the Northeastern that comes to Rio de Janeiro to become famous . The lines of Mara are magnificent , and I loved the definition of " interview " given by Tancredo's maid ( " interview is everything that we do not say that is published " ) . Sonia Mamede and Oscarito dancing in the night-club and Oscarito performing Elvis Presley " ( " Melvis Prestes " ) are among the best scenes I have ever seen in a Brazilian movie .

His best friend No Joo-hwan ( Dae-han Ji ) releases him from the police station , and while calling home from a phone booth , Dae-su vanishes . Indeed he has been abducted and imprisoned in a room for fifteen years . One day , he is suddenly released , receives clothes , money and a cellular and meets the Japanese chef Mido ( Hye-jeong Kang ) , and they feel a great attraction for each other . However , Dae-su seeks for his captor and the reason of his long imprisonment . While looking for revenge and explanation , Dae-su discloses deep secrets from the past . " Oldboy " is really a very impressive and violent Kafkanian tale of revenge . With a stunning direction and supported by an excellent screenplay , where there is explanation for every apparently weird situation , " Oldboy " is also very unpleasant , with the hero being indeed an anti-hero . The theme incest is very strong and almost forbidden for us , westerns , but when I worked in South Korea , I learned that this theme is simply unconceivable for Korean people . Further , a man be called a " dog " is very offensive and a great humiliation . Therefore , I believe that this movie is tougher and more offensive for Korean people , and explains the reaction of Dae-Su when the final secret is disclosed . Based on some unfair bad reviews , I believe this movie is not recommended for certain audiences that need ( and has problem ) to read subtitles and has difficulties to understand other cultures . Title ( Brazil ) : " Oldboy " Obs : Why are there so many users with only one review writing about this movie ? It is very usual to find people writing only one standard favorable review to promote awful movies in IMDb , probably hired by the production of the film . But with " Oldboy " , we can find also many bad reviews written by persons with only one review issued in IMDb . Sounds very weird and fake for me this type of " inspiration " ! Further , what is the meaning of " That user does not exist " in the message board profile of these users ? Is this message correct ? How can a user that " does not exist " write reviews ( and certainly vote ) ?

I watched this unforgettable film in the 70's and I was very impressive with this metaphoric movie . In Brazil , it remained unreleased on video until a couple of months ago , when fortunately it was ' rescued ' and released on DVD by the Brazilian distributor ' Versátil ' , specialized in masterpieces such as Fellini , Rosselini and Visconti . Now I have just had the chance to watch again this weird and daring movie about the decay of the society of consumption , empty and compulsive , searching for sex and food . The main characters uses their Christian names . This movie is also a great black humor comedy .

The story is good , but very short , and most of the time we see excessive special effects , sometimes polluting the screen with too much details . I love " Star Wars " series , but I do not like George Lucas . This director , in 1971 , surprised the world with the cult " THX-1138 " . In 1973 , another great movie : " American Graffiti " . Then , in 1977 , he directed the fantastic " Star Wars " . That was the end of a promising career of director : from this moment on , he limited to the sequels and prequels of Star Wars . Sometimes I wonder if Steven Spielberg limited his career to " Duel " ( 1971 ) , " Jaws " ( 1975 ) , " Close Encounters of the Third Kind " ( 1977 ) , and then " Raiders of Last Ark " episode IV , then V , then VI , then many special editions , then I , then II , and at last III .

He sees that something has fallen on their chicken house and killed two chickens , and he brings the circular object home . On the next morning , Cleci reads on the news that a Sputnik is missing and might have fallen on Earth . Based on the picture of the satellite , they conclude that the object is the sputnik . Anastácio sneaks out of the house with the object and goes to the bank Caixa Econômica Federal to pledge the object and raise some money to repair the chicken house . However , the attendant Dorinha ( Neide Aparecida ) calls her boy-friend Nelson ( Cyl Farney ) that works in the newspaper Tribuna da Cidade under the pseudonym Jacinto Boucha , covering the social column , and he sees the chance of a scoop that could raise his career . However , the snoopy and unethical reporter Alberto ( Alberto Perez ) hears the conversation in an phone extension and releases the news on the front page . Anastácio becomes famous and has an immediate social ascension to the high society , moving to the fancy Copacabana Palace Hotel , while the Russian , North American and French governments send their agents to Brazil to get the sputnik at any cost . This is the fourth time that I have watched " O Homem do Sputnik " , one of the funniest comedies of Brazilian cinema ever . In 1959 , with the Cold War , sputnik and Brigitte Bardot , this movie is a hilarious collection of stereotypes . The sexy and witty Norma Bengell performing BeBe is na amazingly perfect parody of the French actress ; Hamilton Ferreira in the role of a Russian agent and the presently famous Jô Soares ( Joe Soares in 1959 ) performing an American agent chewing gums and swinging while walking are comical . The lines of Oscarito and Zezé Macedo are amusing , and Cyl Farney and Neide Aparecida play the usual good guy and his girl . Title ( Brazil ) : " O Homem do Sputnik " ( " The Man of the Sputnik " )

When I was a boy , I recall how my mother loved this movie . Today I have had the chance to watch it on DVD and it is a delightful classic love story . The romance is very beautiful , showing a tough fight of classes and prejudice in the beginning of the Twentieth Century in Spain . Sarita Montiel is amazingly gorgeous , and have a wonderful chemistry with Raf Vallone . The music score is dated in the present days , but it is still very beautiful , highlighting the title song with the magnificent interpretation of Sarita Montiel .

Further , he brings a message and also a threaten against the danger Earth could cause to other planets : the planet could be destroyed if the people does not live in peace . Any menace to other planets would cause the destruction of the entire planet . This classic is one of the best science-fiction movies I have ever seen . The story is very simple , but the message is wonderful . When this film was made , World War II had finished six years ago only , there was the Cold War and the paranoia of the Americans at that time was against the communists . The special effects are excellent for a 1951 movie . In Brazil , this classic movie was not released on VHS or DVD . It is a shame ! I have a VHS , having a version dubbed in Portuguese , full of commercial and with a terrible quality of image that I recorded from TV many years ago . Yesterday I watched this video again , and it is really an outstanding movie .

368710	2488512	79261	10.0	My Number One Cult-Movie	The antiwar musical " Hair " is my number one cult-movie . I do not know how many time I have seen this film in the movie-theaters and on VHS , or how many times I have listened the CD with the stunning soundtrack , and now , this masterpiece has been finally released on DVD in Brazil . The pacifist and touching story is still amazing , a hymn of freedom , friendship and liberty of choices , and pictures the resistance of a generation against the stupidity of war . I do not know what happened to this wonderful generation of the counterculture of the 70's and their dreams , since the present world is probably worse than in the 70's . I do not recall who won the Oscar in 1979 , but Treat Williams and John Savage deserved at least a nomination for their awesome performances . Beverly D'Angelo is extremely gorgeous in the role of a hypocrite spoiled upper-class teenager . I have seen " Hair " probably more than twelve times , and my eyes always get wet while Berger walks to the airplane singing " That's me , that's me , that's me " , and I start crying with his gravestone in the cemetery .
