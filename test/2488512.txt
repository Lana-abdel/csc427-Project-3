372187	2488512	808210	1.0	Boring , Pointless and Unpleasant Mess	In New York , detective Alex Scott ( Christian Camargo ) is investigating with his partner Sergio Perez ( Carlos Leon ) the disappearance of several children . When they visit the Mexican witch Gloria ( Miriam Colon ) , the woman advises that a powerful evil force is chasing the reincarnation of her son and drowning the other children to bring pain to their mothers . " The Cry " is a boring , pointless and unpleasant mess about a Mexican legend called " La Llorona " . This is the first time that I see a reference to this legend , and maybe this movie might make some sense to those that are familiar with " La Llorona " . However , the screenplay is terrible , without development of characters or situations , and there is an absolute lack of explanation about everything that happens in the story . Why the evil spirit is attacking children in New York ? Why the former Wall Street broker Scott has become a New York detective after losing his son ? Why Maria was able to protect her son and why she blinded herself in the end ? The lead character Scott is absolutely boring ; maybe the actor has felt the turkey he was hired to work . Last but not the least , the theme of mothers drowning babies and children is of an extremely bad taste even for a pseudo-horror movie . Title ( Brazil ) : " Gritos da Morte " ( " Cries of the Death " )
371816	2488512	808279	1.0	Did I Press the Replay Button of the Original " Funny Games " ?	In 1997 , Michael Haneke became worldwide known with his masterpiece of sadism , alienation and cruelty " Funny Games " and I recall how disturbed I was after watching that impressive movie . " Funny Games U . S . " has just been released on DVD in Brazil , and I have decided to check what this version could present to the viewers . The answer : absolutely nothing but the language , spoken in English , and the cast . The performances of Naomi Watts , Michael Pitt , Brady Corbet , Devon Gearhart and Tim Roth are outstanding , but they have added no value to the original movie since it is a remake frame by frame of the original film , giving me the sensation that I pressed the replay button of the original " Funny Game " . Does it worth to remake a movie just to satisfy viewers that can not read subtitles and to fill the pockets of the author ? Title ( Brazil ) : " Violência Gratuita " ( " Free Violence " )
371950	2488512	372832	2.0	Awfully Boring , Annoying and Senseless	The scientist Charles and his wife ( or assistant ) Marissa receive some objects and a skull from an ancient Indian cemetery , and while cleaning a vase , they are attacked and murdered by a mysterious being , the Skeleton Man . Then , a military squad commanded by Captain Leary ( Michael Rooker ) seeks out two groups of four soldiers each that vanished in the jungle . They face the Skeleton Man , shooting him while he kills each soldier . Then the Skeleton Man goes to a power plant , and Captain Leary explodes the facility destroying the supernatural being . I bought " Skeleton Man " on DVD expecting to see a funny trash , but I found an awfully boring , annoying and senseless crap , with shoots and explosions . The imbecile story is totally disconnected and does not make any sense , and the military team is composed of imbeciles , insisting in shooting the supernatural Skeleton Man until they are totally slaughtered . Their leader is also the most stupid , with the blow-up of an entire facility in the end to destroy the supernatural rip-off of the extraterrestrial warrior Predator . On DVD , it is possible to use the fast forward button along the movie and reduce the suffering of the viewer . Title ( Brazil ) : " Skeleton Man "
372374	2488512	167427	2.0	A Boring and Very Silly Comedy , Which Is Not Funny	Mary Katherine Gallagher ( Molly Shannon ) is an orphan raised by her grandmother and student of a catholic school . She decides to participate in a competition of new talents , where the winner will travel to Hollywood and may have a chance to act in a movie . She is also interested in kissing Sky ( Will Ferrell ) , the boyfriend of the selfish Evian ( Elaine Hendrix ) . This movie is a crap . It is a boring comedy , which is not funny . Molly Shannon is not beautiful , not funny , not charismatic and too old for the role of Mary . Her smile , showing the teeth , is horrible ! I hated this trash . I spend the whole film without any laugh . It really deserves a spot in IMDB Bottom 100 . Title ( Brazil ) : ' Superstar - Despenca Uma Estrela ' ( Superstar - Falls a Star ' )
370050	2488512	381601	2.0	Awful Crap	What could I expect of a movie with Sean Astin in the lead role of a scientist ? I have just watched " Slipstream " and I am amazed how awful this movie is : it is incoherent , with bad acting , full of holes in the screenplay and with some of the worst dialogs I have ever heard in a film . I read the excellent lead review from smash016 called " Mere pretentiousness " that practically exposes and summarizes everything I wanted to say about this crap , in a very funny style . As a movie lover , I usually try to see the good and positive points of a movie , but in " Slipstream " I have nothing good to highlight . Do not waste your time and money with this garbage .

" ) While in London in their honeymoon , Rosy and Oskar disclose the real intentions of a voyeur . Tinto Brass writes , directs and edits six erotic tales of extremely bad taste and low level . My first impression is that this film was cast in the red light district , in a brothel or in the porn industry . Most of the " actresses " shows cellulite and have flaccid bodies , or are simply wasted . I do not know the target audience of this crap , but I believe that even the most fanatic fan of Tinto Brass will be disappointed . Title ( Brazil ) : " Faça Isto ! " ( " Do It ! " )
371227	2488512	245356	3.0	Boring , Shallow , Artificial ? Looks a Sequel of the Awful " Prêt-à-Porter "	I bought this VHS attracted and curious by the beautiful and unknown Estella Warren , highlighted in the cover of the Brazilian VHS , and the long list of famous actors and actresses , including Sonia Braga . However , this movie proves that quantity will never mean quality ( only in " IMDb User Rating " ) ? " Perfume " is indeed a boring and shallow movie , with very artificial lines . This crap looks like a sequel of the awful Robert Altman's " Prêt-à-Porter " . The characters are not well developed , most of them only appear to give their names to the credits and create expectation of a good movie ; the storyline about the world fashion is terrible and ambitious ; and the awkward actress Leslie Mann , who plays one of the lead roles , has unpleasant and terrible tone of voice and corporal posture . Title ( Brazil ) : " Perfume "

While the group fight to survive , alien apes plot to use the ark to destroy the human race and dominate planet Earth . I like parodies , but " Miss Castaway " is an offense to human brains . The awful story and the special effects are very , but really very bad . There are spoofs with " Lost " , " Castaway " , " Jurassic Park " , " Sixth Sense " , " Titanic " , " Planet of the Apes " , " Raiders of the Lost Ark " , " Congo " , " MIB " , " Perfect Storm " , " Austin Powers " , " Jaws " , " Mission Impossible " , " Close Encounters of the Third Kind " , " Star Wars " and " Hulk " , but the problem is that most of them are very silly and not funny . In the end , the trailer is better than the film . Title ( Brazil ) : " Missão Quase Impossível " ( " Mission Almost Impossible " )
370612	2488512	808266	4.0	Disappointing Supernatural Romance	The musician and writer of the comic book " Ghost with Heart of Stone " Eduardo ( Vladimir Brichta ) meets the gorgeous Laura ( Aline Moraes ) , who is engaged and close to her marriage , in a bookstore and immediately they fall in love for each other . Sooner they get married , and one night , Eduardo unexpectedly dies , but his soul does not move to the Third World . He meets the Ghost with Heart of Stone ( Gustavo Falcão ) stranded in his house , stalking his beloved next door neighbor D . Mariana ( Laura Cardoso ) and he asks to the ghost how he can communicate and say farewell to Laura . " Fica Comigo Esta Noite " is a disappointing supernatural romance about love after death , with confused and not-well developed characters and situations . The dark humor is weak , the repetition of theme song is boring but the lighting and the atmosphere are great . The Brazilian cinema has many better movies than " Fica Comigo Esta Noite " . Title ( Brazil ) : " Fica Comigo Esta Noite " ( " Stay With Me Tonight " )
370670	2488512	444821	4.0	Pretentious Narcissism	In Rio de Janeiro , the actresses of forty and something years Diana ( Priscilla Rozenbaum ) , Isabel ( Dedina Bernardelli ) , Eugênia ( Clarice Niskier ) and Babi ( Cacá Mourthé ) reunite to write a play about their life experience . Along the afternoon , they disclose confidences about their lovers , husbands , affairs and personal and professional lives . But the director and Diana's husband Mariano ( Domingos de Oliveira ) is not satisfied with the story , since he believes that women in the mid-forties do not confess the truth about their feelings . I bought this DVD expecting a good kind of tropical story à la " Sex and the City " , with four women from Rio de Janeiro of forty and something years and their " adventures " in the wonderful city . Unfortunately I found a boring and pretentious exposition of Narcissism of Domingos de Oliveira , in the role of an intellectual director that is always right in his shallow arguments , even when he totally changes his opinion . The insecure and submissive Babi is concerned with her relationship with Theo ; Eugênia with Guido ; Bel with Caco ; and the ambiguous Diana with Mariano , but all of them in a very confused way and going nowhere . The style of documentary does not present any worthwhile opinion or advice in the interviews , and the messy use of black-and-white alternating with color has no explanation . The charming actresses are excellent and deserved a better movie but the screenplay is absolutely weak and pointless . Title ( Brazil ) : " Feminices " ( " Feminine Things " )
369219	2488512	61132	5.0	Too Many Targets ? In the End , Hunger Kills Ideology	Innocenti Totò ( Totò ) and his son Innocenti Ninetto ( Ninetto Davoli ) are drifting in a road in Italy , when they meet a Marxist speaking crow . The trio travels together in a long journey , but when hunger increases , the crow is simply eaten by the drifters . " Uccellacci e Uccellini " is an original and critical surrealistic fable about the fate of the leftist ideology in the view of Pasolini . Although dated , the lead story is good , using the successful style of road-movie of the 50's explored by other Italian directors , like Fellini or Rossellini ; but like a machine gun , Pasolini shots everywhere making the plot diffused , confused and sometimes boring . Totò has good performance , but Ninetto Davoli in his debut is very silly , with a forced smile on his face . The DVD released in Brazil by the minor Brazilian distributor Mediagroup is surprisingly good , presenting restored image and having lots of extras inclusive a documentary of 28 minutes running time about Pier Paolo Pasolini . There is a mistake in the Audio Menu : the 5 . 1 option shows indeed the movie with comments in Italian . But this minor mistake does not diminish the value of the Brazilian DVD . Title ( Brazil ) : " Gaviões e Passarinhos " ( " Hawks and Sparrows " )
370593	2488512	201316	5.0	Beautiful , Young , Rich and Virgin ? The Perfect Widow	In Minas Gerais , the powerful " colonel " Alexandrão ( Carlos Imperial ) gets married with the young and virgin Cristina ( Adriana Pietro ) and promotes a huge wedding party in his farm . He eats and drinks a lot along the day , and in his " first night " with the bride , he dies before consummating his marriage . The marital status of Cristina becomes very unusual , being a virgin widow . Her doctor advises her to travel to Rio de Janeiro to rest , and she moves with her aunt to an inherited apartment in Leme . Once in Rio de Janeiro , the rascal Constantino ( Jardel Filho ) , who is aware of her wealth , courts her and borrows money , clothes and a Mercedes Benz from his friends , pretending he is businessman man . His friends release " stocks " in a parallel stock market , based and supported in the expectation of the possible marriage of Constantino with Cristina . However , the ghost of Coronel Alexandrão appears for her whenever she intends to have sex with Constantino . " A Viúva Virgem " is an erotic comedy from a dark period of Brazilian cinema history . The military dictatorship installed in my country stimulated this type of silly erotic movie called " pornochanchada " to the population . " A Viúva Virgem " was very famous and one of the best , indeed a milestone and a symbol of a successful " pornochanchada " of those times . All of them were very appellative low budget movies , having ham actors and actresses , and many naked models and popular low level jokes . This was one of the last movies of the gorgeous Adriana Pietro , who died in a road accident in 1974 , when she was only twenty-four years old . This movie is a good opportunity also to revisit the wonderful city of Rio de Janeiro in the 70's , before being partially destroyed by the slums and the construction boom . Title ( Brazil ) : " A Viúva Virgem " ( " The Virgin Widow " )
369442	2488512	131704	5.0	A Waste of an Excellent Cast and Budget in a Very Silly Movie	First of all , let me explain that these characters ( Rocky ? Dentinho & Bullwinkle ? Alceu ) are completely unknown in Brazil . My son , my daughter , my wife and I , i . e . very different generations , have never heard anything about this animated cartoon . Therefore , part of the jokes are lost for us . Maybe in North America or in other countries where this cartoon is popular , the viewers may have a different approach . But this is not the unique problem , otherwise we would not like the yearly released new character , for example , by Disney studios or Dreamworks . The cast of ' The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle ' is excellent , having names like Robert de Niro , Whoopy Goldberg , John Goodman , Rene Russo , Randy Quaid , Jason Alexander and Janeane Garofalo and the effects are great meaning very high budget . However , the story is so horribly silly , that maybe even children may find it imbecile . Title ( Brazil ) : ' As Aventuras de Alceu e Dentinho ' ( ' The Adventure of Alceu and Little Tooth ' )
369488	2488512	451957	5.0	Predictable and Forgettable	Samantha Owens ( Mara ) is the editor of the high school newspaper and was blacklisted with her two friends , Gina ( Haley McCormick ) and Mindy ( Olesya Rulin ) , by the football players after an article about them , so they do not go to a high school party . Samantha tells to the other girls an urban legend told by her mother : in 1969 , in Salt Lake City , the two girlfriends of Mary Banner ( Lilith Fields ) are drugged by their dates in a prom , but she understands the situation and runs from her date , who kills her and hide her body in a trunk in the basement of the school . Like the Candyman , Samantha speaks " Bloody Mary " three times , evoking the evil spirit of Mary . Along the night , the three girls are drugged and kidnapped in a prank of the players , but Samantha has visions and premonitions about Mary . When her school mates are killed , Mary visits Grace Taylor ( Tina Lifford ) , one of the girls abused in 1969 , and finds that the victims are the descendants of the trio that killed Mary and harmed her friends , and that Mary spirit is seeking for revenge . I bought this DVD full of good expectations , based on the name of director Mary Lambert , since " Pet Sematary " is one of my favorite horror movies ever . Unfortunately , the predictable and forgettable story of " Urban Legends : Bloody Mary " is very bad and full of clichés . Mary crawling from the bottom of the bed is a rip-off of Samara in " The Ring " . It seems that there is only some care with the gore deaths , but the same does not happen with the characters . For example , Samantha's mother Pam ( Nancy Everhard ) , who told the story of Mary to Samantha , vanishes and Samantha and David never ask for additional information about Mary to her . David is stupidly killed and Samantha in the end of the story with Grace does not miss or even mention him . The death of Heather Thompson , attacked by spiders , is the best moment of this disappointing flick . Title ( Brazil ) : " Lendas Urbanas 3 : A Vingança de Mary " ( " Urban Legends 3 : Mary's Revenge " )
369027	2488512	41842	5.0	To Make the Viewers Become Vegetarian	In the periphery of Paris , the fate of horses , cows and other animals in a slaughterhouse is detailed in this short documentary . My first comment about this disgusting short is that fortunately it is not in color . I believe that there are two possible views of this short : technically , my opinion is that it is perfect . The shootings of Paris , the cinematography , the camera , the skill of the workers , in this regard everything is perfectly shown . However , the theme is simply awful and of a completely bad taste . I do not know if George Franju was vegetarian , but probably his intention showing the slaughter of animals , inclusive of an offspring , was to make the viewers become vegetarian . I believe most of the pseudo-intellectual readers will not like my review , but that was my impression of this documentary . Title ( Brazil ) : " O Sangue das Bestas " ( " The Blood of the Beasts " )
371028	2488512	539473	5.0	The Ice Cream Man and the Demon Children	Prue has a melody in her head and when she sees a girl humming the tune , she finds that it belongs to the ice-cream truck . Prue and Phoebe follow the girl and the trio is sucked by a vortex inside the van . They find a playground in the middle of the snow and several children hiding from The Nothing . They rescue the children and once back in San Francisco , they realize that they are demon children . Meanwhile , their father Victor Bennett returns and helps his daughters to fix the situation , capturing the dangerous demons and sending them back to The Nothing . " We All Scream for Ice Cream " is a very silly episode of " Charmed " . The corny return of the father of the Halliwell sisters and the explanation for his absence are totally unreasonable and boring . Title ( Brazil ) : " O Sorveteiro " ( " The Ice Cream Man " )
369697	2488512	271136	5.0	If You Do Not Have Nothing Better To Do In a Rainy Saturday Afternoon , You May Watch and Even Appreciate This Movie	Jake Mellows ( Michael Keaton ) is a divorced American banker sent to Monaco to investigate the possibility of laundering of money . Apparently the laundry of money was made through the production of films . In Monaco , he meets Lela Forin ( Judith Godrèche ) , the financial manager of Miramax films , and Michael Caine , a decadent , alcoholic and gambler previously famous actor of action movies . Being in Europe , makes him promise his teenager daughter to visit her in London . Then , he gets absurdly involved in the murdering of the ports chief of police of Monaco . Then he realizes that most of the high level characters of the story are somehow involved with corruption . Next , his daughter is kidnapped . Jake will have to fight against powerful persons trying to save his daughter and himself and prove his innocence . This plot is so absurd and has so many ' holes ' that becomes funny . The murdering of the ports chief of police ' à la Kennedy ' and how and why Jake is blamed are ridiculous . Anyway , if the viewer do not have nothing better to do in a rainy Saturday afternoon , there is a chance to enjoy this flick . The excellent Michael Caine is not decadent yet like his character , and Michael Keaton is a good actor .
369396	2488512	418763	5.0	Distant From the War	In 1989 , when Iraq invaded Kuwait , the USA sent countless troops to Middle East deserts to combat Saddam Hussein army . " Jarhead " is based on a book written by one Marine , who joined this force due to lack of professional options , since he was not able to go to college . This movie shows the Marine Corp trained by stupid and sadistic leaders , and the troop completely alienated , in a war without seeing the enemy , or knows the country or the costumes of the locals , and even the reasons for their action , being trained like pawns , aiming to kill an enemy . I do not know the reality of the Marines , but the way the story is presented it is not compatible with the worldwide image they have , mostly due to Hollywood movies . I was a little disappointed with director Sam Mendes , after " American Beauty " ( 1999 ) and " Road to Perdition " ( 2002 ) . With the usual interval of three years to make a movie , he should have selected a better screenplay . Title ( Brazil ) : " Soldado Anônimo " ( " Anonymous Soldier " )
368689	2488512	191297	6.0	Important in Brazilian Filmography , But Also Very Dated	In the slums of São Paulo in the 30's , Carmen ( Carmem Violeta ) is a young woman abused by her stepfather ( Humberto Mauro ) . She leaves her home and finds that her boyfriend Milton ( Milton Marinho ) is married . While looking for a job , she faints on the street and is helped by the writer Flávio ( Celso Montenegro ) . She moves to his house and maritally lives with him . Flávio becomes shared between the love for Carmen , the desire for his former fiancée and the passion and self-interest for a wealthy young daughter of a powerful judge . " Mulher " is an important movie in the Brazilian filmography , since it was shot after the Revolution of 1930 and presents a powerful woman character , Carmen . One of the greatest transgressions of this film is the fact that she lives with her beloved mate , but they are not married . In the end of the story , they stay together , but also without a wedding . In the hypocrite Brazilian society of the 30's , a woman of such behavior would be unacceptable . Nevertheless , this story is very dated in the present days . This film was restored with the support of the Brazilian oil company Petrobras , and the destroyed parts were completed with inter-titles to avoid breaking the soundtrack . Title ( Brazil ) : " Mulher " ( " Woman " )

Due to the long round trip of eighteen years , the explorers have been forgotten by Earth . The Enterprise scans Terra Nova and finds fifty-eight humans living in the underside . When Archer , T'Pol , Malcolm and Travis reach the planet , they are treated as if they were hostile aliens by the locals . However , they find that Nardet , the mother of the leader of the human mutants , has lung cancer , and they bring her to be treated in Enterprise . But Dr . Phlox finds that their water is contaminated by a poison rain . Captain Archer suggests the relocation by force in the non-contaminated south hemisphere of the planet , but T'Pol advises that this procedure would destroy the Novan's culture . However fate helps Archer to find a solution . " Terra Nova " is the weakest episode of this series up to this moment , with a non-original . It is amazing the silly and quite stupid decision of Captain Archer , believing that he could bring a breed of mutants to Earth without thinking in the consequences of his unreasonable act . Title ( Brazil ) : " Terra Nova " ( " New Land " )

However , the ship is surprisingly stopped by another Enterprise from the future with the descendants of the original crew-members . Lorian , the captain and son of Trip and T'Pol , explains that the original Enterprise was sent one hundred and seventeen years back in time while escaping from the Kavalans through the corridor , and they want to help the Enterprise to succeed and accomplish her mission at any cost . " E2 " is a flawed episode , where the only explanation for the holes in the screenplay is the Expanse , where the laws of physics and time are different . T'Pol alive and the duplicate Enterprise together with the original T'Pol and Enterprise are absolutely incoherent and I did not like this unnecessary and forgettable episode . Title ( Brazil ) : " Enterprise 2 "

When T'Pol detects an alien form in the ship , the reaction of Ryan is violent and the Enterprise discovers that the officer is plot revenge against the Nausicaans , jeopardizing the space route for other freighters . " Fortunate Son " is the weakest episode of this good series so far . The story of revenge of Officer Ryan is silly and pointless , since the guy is not totally wrong . The Nausicaans are pirates and attack the freighters , and the Starfleet does not take any action , therefore his attitude of despair seems to be very reasonable . The moral message of this episode in the end is blurred . Title ( Brazil ) : " Mercadores do Espaço " ( " Merchants of Space " )

The team is also volunteer to the experiences , and is under investigation of Paula Henning ( Franka Potente ) . When Jo gets close to a Filipino nurse , and becomes addicted in the drugs used in experience , he realizes the truth hidden in the methods used by the secret society in the development of science . " Anatomy 2 " is a deceptive and forgettable story with total lack of credibility . The participation of Franka Potente is ridiculous , only to give her name to the credits and to attract her fans . The implausible story is very imbecile , but anyway if the viewer shutdown the brain , the film entertains . Title ( Brazil ) : " Anatomia 2 " ( " Anatomy 2 " )

This low-budget movie is a dramatization of this deplorable event , based on the report of one of the survivors of the ' day after ' of Nagasaki . Tomorrow is the sad anniversary of this massacre and I decided to see this movie for the first time . Unfortunately , the quality of the image of the Brazilian VHS is not good .

Clark is affected by the red kryptonite transferred through her lips and crashes Lex and Lana's engagement dinner party with Lois ; he tells his true feelings to Lois , Martha , Chloe and Lana , and kidnaps Lana , opening his heart and damaging relationships . The episode " Crimson " seems to be a plot point in the whole " Smallville " series .

How his reckless speech will affect Martha , Chloe , Lana and Lois in future ? The mystery about Lana's baby is intriguing with the last line of Lex to her doctor , but this episode has a huge flaw .

Lana Lang confess to Chloe Sullivan that she is virgin , but Chloe tells her that she loved a guy called Jimmy during her working period in the Daily Planet . Lana decides to have sex with Jason to keep their relationship . Lex Luthor and Lionel Luthor give a break in their fight and have a closer contact . In this episode , there are many confessions about virginity . I did not like the story , and I found it very incoherent , since Alicia stayed for more than a year in an institution keeping Clark Kent's secret , and was shot to keep his secret . Therefore , why is Clark so afraid of a relationship with Alicia , if the girl proved that loves him and accepts him the way he is ? Martha knows that Clark traveled to Las Vegas due to the effect of the red kryptonite , so why the final complaint with Clark ? The lack of coherence in the attitude of these characters really upset me . Title ( Brazil ) : " Em Perigo " ( " In Danger " )

The same event is showed through different perspectives in four different versions told by Little Red Hiding Hood , The Wolf , The Woodsman and Granny . The trailer of " Hoodwinked !

The mysterious Jiji ( Shinya Tsukamoto ) arrives in their office and accuses the rival Yakuza Suzuki ( Sabu ) of abducting Anjo , and Kakihara tortures him trying to locate the boss . When Kakihara realizes that he has committed a mistake , he pays with his tongue to the Yakuza and sooner he finds that the responsible is the psychopath and mentally deficient Ichi , who was abused in his childhood and is sexually repressed , and is controlled by Jiji using his skills in martial arts and blades to eliminate the gangsters . " Koroshiya 1 " is another gore and twisted movie of Takashi Miike , where most of the characters are bizarre and practically all the stylish scenes disclose tortures , perversion and explicit violence . I know his style , therefore there is no surprise for me in what I have just seen ; however , unfortunately this movie has a messy screenplay . I did not find the motives for the procedure of Jiji and I did not understand the last scene . Title ( Brazil ) : " Ichi , O Assassino " ( " Ichi , The Killer " )
368979	2488512	235712	6.0	Confused and Scary	This story happens thirty years before the first ' Ring ' . It tells , in a dramatic way , the story of Sadako Yamamura ( Yukie Nakama ) when she was a teenager , working on a theater stage as an actress and having a crush in Tôyama ( Seiichi Tanabe ) . The problem is the very confused screenplay and the badly developed characters . I do not know whether the translation to Portuguese along the film is correct . I watched a VHS spoken in Japanese with subtitles in Portuguese , but when I watch a movie in English , I note that there are many mistakes or omissions in the translation to Portuguese . Therefore , I do not know how precise is the translation in the Brazilian VHS . I myself did not understand the story as a whole , but I agree it is scary . I do not dare to say that it is a bad movie , but unfortunately I felt lost in many parts of the plot . In the future , I intend to watch the three Japanese ' Ring ' in sequence , and maybe the story becomes clearer . The actress Yukie Nakama is an amazingly beautiful and delicate young woman . I was astonished with her beauty . Title ( Brazil ) : ' Ring 0 ? O Chamado ? Birthday ' ( ' Ring 0 ? The Calling ? Birthday ' )
371425	2488512	174336	6.0	When the Teenagers of ' American Pie ' Grow up ?	Brad ( Brian Van Holt ) , Zeke ( Zorie Barber ) and Jonathan ( Jonathan Abrahams ) are best friends . They use to meet each other once a week together with their married friend Eric ( Judah Domke ) to tell theirs dates , affairs and sex experiences along the week . Brad and Zeke are greater lovers and Jonathan loves to self-masturbate . One day , each one of them tells the others that have met the perfect girl . Indeed , they come to realize that the girl is the same , Mia ( Amanda Peet ) . A great dispute among them will shake their friendship . A funny surprising end will conclude the plot . This is a film that looks like that is based on the teenagers of ' American Pie ' , when they have grown up . The ' low level ' and scatological jokes , the concept of relationship with a woman , the focus on sex , the entire screenplay seems to be ' inspired ' in ' American Pie ' . However , it has many funny moments and will certainly entertain the fans of movies like ? ' American Pie ' .
369685	2488512	128158	6.0	Remake , Tribute or Plagiarism of ' Evil Dead ' ?	On her birthday , Dora ( Audrey Lowe ) and her friends Hope ( Kirstin Leigh ) and Rudy ( Brady Fischer ) travel with her boyfriend Stanley ( Patrick Lawlor ) to the cabin of his uncle , a man who studied superstitions and other supernatural matters , in the woods to spend a couple of days together . Rudy finds a weird box in the basement , and brings it to the living room . Dora opens it and an evil force is released . Rudy is possessed by the unleashed devil , threatening his friends along a night of horror . I do not know whether this Vince Di Meglio wants to remake or to pay a tribute to Sam Raimi's ' Evil Dead ' , but I did not see the name of this great director in the credits . Therefore , I believe that ' Deadfall ' is indeed a plagiarism of that masterpiece of horror . Anyway , there are good effects and in the end this is a watchable movie . Title ( Brazil ) : A Força Sinistra ' ( ' The Sinister Force ' )
370798	2488512	384570	6.0	Promising Beginning , Typical TV Movie Conclusion	After being raped by a serial killer , Jillian Hayes ( Roma Downney ) , Carol Rosen ( Jacqueline Bisset ) and Meg Pesaturo ( Lauren Lee Smith ) found " The Survivors Club " , and they use the press to force the police and justice to arrest the rapist . Eddie Como ( Darren Shahlavi ) is arrested , based on DNA evidences , and while going to court for trial , he is murdered by a sniper and the three women switch position from victims to suspects . Detective Roan Griffin ( James Remar ) , who is traumatized by the brutal murder of his beloved wife by the manipulative killer David Price ( Brian Markinson ) , joins the investigation with detective Fitz Fitzpatrick ( Jerry Wasseman ) trying to solve the case . " The Survivors Club " has a promising and original premise , with victims trading positions to suspects after the murder of the prime suspect . The story is tense and keeps the mystery , but in the middle of the plot , the writer decides to have a romance between the detective and the suspect , and introduces a criminal that is a rip-off of Dr . Hannibal Lecter and spoils the good movie with a typical commercial conclusion of an ordinary TV movie . Anyway , this flick is a reasonable entertainment .

The book is supposed to be written by Marisa , under the pseudonym of Antonio Castro , and becomes a successful bestseller . Marisa does not tell Antonio and becomes famous , when many ironical situations happen . The first part of this story is really funny , when the character of Antonio Banderas believes the police want to catch him for murderer and Marisa cheats her husband . The situations of the cuckold are hilarious . The second part loses the rhythm , but anyway this comedy is a very worthwhile entertainment . In Brazil , it was released on VHS , with the name ' Casos da Vida Privada : A Mulher Feliz ' ( ' Cases of the Private Life : The Happy Woman ' ) together with a second episode , ' La Mujer Oriental ' ( ' The Oriental Woman ' ) . Title ( Brazil ) : ' Casos da Vida Privada : A Mulher Feliz ' ( ' Cases of the Private Life : The Happy Woman ' )

Hall ) alone . She has only two friends in her job among her gossiper colleagues . When her overprotected daughter is seduced by her mathematic teacher Peter Robertson ( Martin Donovan ) , the world of Isabelle falls apart . She becomes lost and loses her confidence on Amy , spoiling their relationship . Their bond gets tied again when Isabelle discloses her inner secrets from the past to Amy . Although being very predictable , " Amy & Isabelle " is a beautiful coming to age drama . The good direction and acting never lets the story becomes a soap opera , although dealing with elements like seduction and secrets . The innocence of the face and look of the gorgeous Hanna R . Hall is amazing . I was impressed ( and quite disappointed ) how fat the lovely and still beautiful Elisabeth Shue , one of my favorite actresses ever , is . But her and Hanna R . Hall performances were really great . Title ( Brazil ) : " Inocência Marcada " ( " Marked Innocence " )
372103	2488512	87909	7.0	Total Cult	In Switzerland , the teenager Jennifer Corvino ( Jennifer Connelly ) , daughter of a famous actor , arrives in an expensive board school and shares her room with the French schoolmate Sophie ( Federica Mastroianni ) .

While sleepwalking , she meets and becomes friend of a Scottish entomologist , Prof . John McGregor ( Donald Pleasence ) , and his chimpanzee Tonga . Jennifer decides to help the investigation of Dr . McGregor about a serial killer that is killing young girls in that area . It may sound ridiculous , but " Phenomena " has never been released on video in Brazil ; only two days ago , " Phenomena " was released on DVD in Brazil and now I am glad to have this movie in my collection . The weird story of Dario Argento , one of my favorite directors , is a total cult , showing bizarre characters and situations , maggots , flies , deformed people , serial killer and lots of bodies and body parts . A fifteen years old Jennifer Connelly in her third work , extremely beautiful , shines in the very original role of a sleepwalker that is very connected to insects and develop the skill of communicate with them . Daria Nicolodi , the mother of Asia Argento and former mate of Dario Argento , has a minor , but very important role . And the versatile Donald Pleasence , in the role of a paraplegic researcher , is efficient as usual . The music score , with Goblin , Iron Maiden and Motorhead , is another great attraction of this movie . Title ( Brazil ) : " Phenomena "

Fearing their reaction , T'Pol recommends leaving the ship immediately , but Bu'kaH awakes , attacks Reed and hijacks the shuttle . While the vessel sinks in the atmosphere near to collapse , the group tries to identify the defect to fly with the ship again . " Sleeping Dogs " shows the ingratitude of the Klingon and how distrustful this breed is . Further , their principle of honor is also very interesting regarding they are warriors . But Archer uses shrewdness and knowledge to accomplish his objective . Title ( Brazil ) : " Cães Adormecidos " ( " Sleeping Dogs " )
369739	2488512	191074	7.0	Good Story With a Bad Casting	In Lawrence Ville , the poor student of University Colby Alicia Campbell ( Mia Kirshner ) , had an overdose and is in coma in the intensive care unit of the local hospital . Sheriff Artie Bonner ( Taye Diggs ) is called by the Dean ( Edmund J . Kearney ) and intimidated to carry out a shallow and discreet investigation , since the school is very dependent of the wealthy families of the riches students , and a scandal would jeopardize its reputation and consequently its income . The mother of Alicia , Connie Campbell ( Glynnis O'Connor ) , is blaming her new upper class friends of drugging her daughter . Hadley Ashton ( Meredith Monroe ) , Sidney Connors ( Dominique ' Lolita ' Swan ) , Julianne McDowell Levinson ( Rachel True ) and Trevor ( Scott Bairstow ) have become her friend a few time ago , and Alicia was seduced by the ' world of the rich people ' . Through interviews and investigation of the manipulative students , Sheriff Bonner discovers the truth . I liked this amoral movie . The screenplay is intriguing and the story is presented in pieces through flashbacks along the investigation of Artie Bonner . In the end , none of the characters is really like we supposed they were . The problem with this movie is the age of the lead actresses . It is very hard to believe that , women of about thirty years old in real life can really play the roles of young women . Anyway , it is a good entertainment . Title ( Brazil ) : ' Perversas Intenções ' ( ' Wicked Intentions ' )

A government representative comes to the Enterprise and travels with the crew to release Archer and Trip and avoid other misunderstandings . However , the prisoner Kuroda and his Nausican partner escape from their handcuffs , dominate the guards and take control of the ship . " Canamar " is a predictable and unoriginal episode , without anything special . Archer uses his intelligence to lure the criminal and control the situation , while the poor Trip has to hear the experiences of the annoying alien . Title ( Brazil ) : " Canamar "

When the situation is dramatic and critical , Hoshi contacts another craft from the breed that had been murdered , the Axanar . " Fight or Flight " is a reasonable episode of Enterprise with a greater participation of the insecure Hoshi . T'Pol is more restraint by Captain Archer , but her advices are sensate and wise , contrasting with the impulsive Captain Archer . The preoccupation with the slug is silly , and the attitude of leaving the worm in another planet is irresponsible with the environment . Title ( Brazil ) : " Luta ou Fuga " ( " Fight or Runaway " )

The quartet drives with the boy to a camping area in Maine , closed in the cold winter , where they are individually disturbed by whispers that affects their behaviors until Max discloses the dark secret about David and his mother . " Whisper " is a very effective horror movie that scares without explicit violence or gore . The association of the fallen angel David and the Antichrist Damien from " The Omen " is quite immediate , but the creepy story is engaging and developed in a suitable pace . The young actor Blake Woodruff has a top-notch performance in the role of the evil soul collector and the acting and direction are solid . The twist with the identity of the leader of the kidnappers is a great unpredictable plot point . Title ( Brazil ) : " Reféns do Mal " ( " Hostages of the Evil " )

Later Sid calls them and they are introduced to the paranormal investigators Vincent Cochet ( Tcheky Kayro ) and Frances ( Megahn Perry ) , who tell them that Sid read an ancient spell that cursed the trio and brought back the ghosts of the graves from the damned sector of the cemetery where they danced . He also discloses that Harris and Allison are being haunted by an insane ax murderer pianist ; Kira by a sadistic rapist ; and Sid by a pyromaniac . They have to break the curse or survive for an entire cycle of the full moon when the curse would finish , while the ghosts are getting stronger and stronger . Yesterday I saw " The Gravedancers " on cable and I really liked this horror movie . The supernatural ghost story is original and scary , having right doses of humor and funny moments , and the acting is reasonable . This is the first time that I see the idea of bringing ghosts back from hell through the disrespect to the grave of the dead , and I found it great . This movie is highly recommended to fans of the genre . Title ( Brazil ) : " Carta Para a Morte " ( " Letter to the Death " )

After an accident in a waterfall , the survivors realize that a pack of anacondas have gathered for mating and their nest is nearby the plantation of Blood Orchid , which made them bigger and bigger . I saw " Anacondas : The Hunt for the Blood Orchid " with a very low expectation based on the IMDb User Rating , but I liked this entertaining adventure a lot . The story is full of action and humor , and I laughed a lot when Cole calls Sam of " Lorena Babbitt " when she cuts the head of one anaconda . There are the usual clichés of this type of predictable B-movie , but I had a good surprise in the end .

In the end , we see that it is almost impossible to control life , and sometimes , a subtle incident may lead to fatality . I did not find the word " Tesseract " in Webster or American Heritage Dictionary , but in internet , I found that it would be a 4-dimensional cube . The explanation of this word is also provided in the introduction of the movie . Using this concept with four characters in a hotel , reducing to three and converging to one , the screenplay writer wrote a very original and intriguing story , apparently based on a book , confused in the first twenty minutes since it is non-linear , but attractive when the viewer understands the plot . I believe that watching for the second time , this film would be better and better , and that is my intention in a near future . I liked the idea of how difficult would be to control our destiny , which is connected and affected by the actions of other people . Jonathan Rhys-Meyers , Alexander Rendel and Saskia Reeves give great performances . I really recommend this movie to audiences that like a dark and different story .

Along their journey , Alice gets minor jobs and has some love deceptions and desperate situations . This movie has great dialogs , an outstanding performance of Ellen Burstyn and an excellent camera work . The screenplay is unconventional and intriguing , but I did not like its conclusion . It is very difficult to identify the teenager Jodie Foster looking like a boy . Great participation of the boy Alfred Lutter in the role of the rebel Tommy .

" A Date with Darkness : The Trial and Capture of Andrew Luster " is a great TV movie based on a true story . I liked the way the story is disclosed and the performance of the cast , specially the cynical face of Jason Gedrick , who is perfect in the role of a manipulative sociopath . Although being a made-for-TV movie , this movie has a good screenplay , direction and acting . Title ( Brazil ) : " Líquido X " ( " Liquid X " )

370710	2488512	264616	8.0	A Great Debut of Bill Paxton as Director in a Very Scary Low-Budget Movie	Matthew McConaughey is a mysterious man waiting for Agent Wesley Doyle ( Powers Boothe ) in his FBI office . He claims to have information about a serial killer chased by FBI . When Agent Doyle arrives in the office , he tells him that the serial killer is indeed his dead brother . Agent Doyle requests some evidence , and the man tells the story of his life , since his childhood . They were a simple family of three : his widow father Meiks ( Bill Paxton ) , his brother and himself . One night , his father gathers the two brothers and tells them that an angel of God had just visited him and assigned his family to destroy demons . What happens next is one of the most scary movie I have ever seen . I watched this movie four months ago on VHS , and yesterday I watched again , now on DVD . Although being a low-budget movie , the screenplay is sharp , with no flaw . The cast is outstanding , but I would like to highlight the performance of Matt O'Leary as the young Felton . It is a very difficult and complex role to be performed by a young teenager . The direction of Bill Paxton is remarkable . There is no explicit violence in this horror movie . A great debut behind the camera . I regret the Brazilian title of this movie : ' A Mão do Diabo ' ( The Devil's Hand ' ) . If at least it were ' The God's Hand ' , it might be acceptable . But calling this movie as ' the devil's hand ' is indeed ridiculous . Brent Hanley , the screenwriter , did not deserve such a lack of respect from the Brazilian distributor . This film is highly recommended . Title ( Brazil ) : " A Mão do Diabo " ( " The Devil's Hand " )

Meanwhile Self kills the intermediate Vikan and his bodyguard to deal Scylla directly with the buyer . " Just Business " is a stalled episode , with many exaggerated twists and betrayals . If Michael and his group wanted a meeting with a trustful authority , why not the General Attorney Cooper Green they met on the episode " Wash " ? The bad timing rules this show : Michael faints in the exact moment he has the complete Scylla ; Lincoln unexpectedly hits Self and the whole group is surprised by Gretchen ; why Sucre would try to dominate a skilled killer like Gretchen with bare hands , when a weapon should have resolved the whole problem . Why Mahone would schedule a meeting with his opponent , the ambitious Agent Mark Wheeler , without having Scylla ? It would be more reasonable if he had helped Michael , Sucre , Lincoln and Sara first to retrieve and schedule an encounter with Wheeler later . When T-Bag does a good deed , he is betrayed .

He goes to the war and leaves his family . Michael Whiteacre ( Dean Martin ) is a successful actor who became friend of Noah while in New York and is also obliged to join the army and go to London . There , he decides to leave the office activity and join his platoon in the front . This movie is excellent . It shows common people being used by government in a senseless war . All the main characters are peaceful common persons : Christian is a very simple person , wishing to climb socially in life in a Germany without opportunities and is misguided by the speech of Hitler and pretty soon he becomes aware how stupid war is . Noah is also a very simple person , a salesman from a department store , who indeed wishes to be with his family and join the Army just for obligation . And Michael is a selfish actor and bon vivant , without any sense of patriotism and who is not interest in anything but to have his life back . These characters are put together in a stupid war , having to kill persons to save their lives and to obey orders , which they do not agree . This movie is an excellent perspective of the stupidity of a war .

He drinks sake with her and later he asks the woman to tell the story of her life . The prostitute discloses a dark and cruel story about her life and the sad fate of Komomo .

Using magnificent camera-work and impressive make-up in an awesome atmosphere , " Imprint " approaches gruesome and gore theme like abortion , fetus , incest , torture , perversions and abuse along 63 minutes running time of pure and sick horror with many twists . I confess that I felt uncomfortable and disturbed with the sadistic sequence of the torture of Komomo . Takashi Miike really honors the title of this series , being a Master of Horror .

The dispute between the " Focker-ized " and very " Zen " family and the rigid and paranoid Jack Byrnes made me burst in a " non-stop laughing " mode not only along the movie , but also after , recalling the funny scenes and gags . The talent of Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro as comedians is very well-known by the audiences , but Dustin Hoffman surprised me how funny he is . Barbra Streisand is also excellent , and the jokes with the English word " Focker " are great . For my surprise , there are IMDb users that hated this movie , probably bitter people without sense of humor that unfortunately we stumble in our lives . If the reader of my simple review wants to laugh , see this movie . Title ( Brazil ) : " Entrando Numa Fria Maior Ainda " ( a slang , that means " Getting into a Bigger Trouble " )

The destructive little gossips , the difficulties of communication , and many other problems of relationship are also shown in this little gem .

There , the skinheads believe he is the representative of a wealthy American , who wants to sponsor a German Neo-Nazis group . This film is very scary , since it is based on a true story . It is almost unthinkable that , in 2004 , there are persons having such a feeling of rage in their hearts against other human beings , just because of their religions or ethnicity . Oliver Platt has a great performance as a brave and audacious man . Very disgusting , but also a very important and highly recommended film about intolerance and racism .

Holmes . When Jo decides to search the last victim behind the walls , she is captured by the evil spirit , and Dean and Sam figures out how to rescue Jo and escape from the wrath of Ellen . " No Exit " is and engaging but flawed episode of " Supernatural " . The story has good moments , like the revelation of Ellen to Jo about her relationship with John Winchester , but I honestly believed Jo was actually sister of Dean and Sam . The greatest flaw of the story is the use of the sledge hammer in the walls of the apartment building does not bring the attention of the super or the dwellers .

In order to avoid a scandal , the Archdiocese hires the successful , ambitious and agnostic lawyer Erin Bruner ( Laura Linney ) , and the prosecution assigns the religious prosecutor Ethan Thomas ( Campbell Scott ) . Along the days , there is a battle between science and religion in the court . " The Exorcism of Emily Rose " was a great surprise for me . Based on a true event , I was expecting a horror movie like " The Exorcist " , but actually it is a great story of trial , with the confrontation of science and religion , but with an agnostic lawyer defending and a religious one accusing a priest . The story is leaded by Erin , and her contact with the unknown and her final speech are some of the great moments of this film . Among the scariest parts are Dr . Cartwright ( Duncan Fraser ) saying that he started praying again since he had witnessed the exorcism , and when the priest explains that 3 AM is the demoniac witching hour . The direction of Scott Derrickson is excellent , using special effects only when necessary , and very well supported by a magnificent cast , leaded by the wonderful Laura Linney and the great Tom Wilkinson , followed by the unknown Jennifer Carpenter , who is great in the role of Emily Rose , Campbell Scott and Colm Feore .

I rented " White Noise 2 : The Light " with a lower expectation , but as a fan of horror movies , I decided to give a chance to this film . What a great surprise ! " White Noise 2 : The Light " is scary , having a creepy story with characters well developed and with good explanations for the most different situations . The concept recalls the " Final Destination " franchise ( if you cheat The Ripper , he will chase you ) but with a different approach , through NDE and EVP .

This movie participated of the following film festivals : 1 ) Festival do Rio BR ; 2 ) Mar del Plata Festival ; 3 ) Festival de Cinema do Recife ( " hors concours " ) ; 4 ) Miami Festival of Brazilian Movies : - Best Movie ; - Best Screenplay ; - Best Support Actor : Tony Ramos ; - Best Soundtrack . 5 ) Montreal Festival ( " hors concours " ) ; 6 ) Festival de Gramado : - Best Lead Actor : Tony Ramos ; - Best Lead Actress : Isabel Guéron ; - Best Support Actor : Juca de oliveira ; - Best Art Direction : Gualter Pupo . 7 ) Festival de Natal : - Best Support Actress : Zezé Polessa ; - Best Art Direction : Gualter Pupo . 8 ) Del Nuevo Cine Latinoamericano International Festival ( Cuba Festival ) ; 9 ) Palm Springs International Film Festival ; 10 ) Tiburon International Film Festival ; 11 ) Philadelphia Festival of World Cinema ; 12 ) Chicago Latino Film Festival ; and , 13 ) Paris Brazilian Cinema Festival . The Brazilian DVD , released by Warner do Brasil , wrongly spells the French expression " hors concours " in the list of film festivals in the " Extra " and does not provide the year of each foregoing festival . Considering that Warner is not a minor distributor , it is a shame and a lack of respect with the Brazilian consumer ! Title ( Brazil ) : " Bufo e Spallanzani "

In spite of that , the plot point is totally unexpected and I really loved this film . His work is supported by the gorgeous and sweet Anat Klausner , an unknown actress that has a stunning performance . I hope to have a chance to see his next work in a near future , and I can not understand how an actress with the potential of Anat Klausner has only this excellent movie in her filmography .

Meanwhile , Carrie matures and becomes successful in her business . " Carrie " is a cruel classic romance , with a stunning performance of the great British actor Laurence Olivier , who surprisingly was not nominated as Best Lead Actor to the Oscar . I am really impressed with his acting in this movie , being perfect either as an elegant upper class man or as a beggar . The direction of William Wiler is brilliant and stylist as usual , supported by magnificent costumes and decorations . Jennifer Jones , Eddie Albert and Miriam Hopkins give credibility to their characters with their great performances . The romantic and dramatic story does not have the usual commercial happy end of Hollywood movies , but a credible and realistic conclusion , and maybe that is why I loved this film .

The desperate Louis meets the golden hearted whore Ophelia ( Jamie Lee Curtis ) , who lodges him at her house and helps him . When Billy Ray overhears the Duke Brothers discussing their bet in the bathroom , he seeks out Louis and together they plot their revenge . " Trading Places " is certainly one of the best comedies of the 80's . Eddie Murphy in the beginning of his career was extremely funny and together with Dan Aykroyd , they are hilarious ; the veterans Denholm Elliott , Don Ameche and Denholm Elliott are amazing ; and Jamie Lee Curtis extremely sexy . I have just watched this movie again now on the DVD released by Paramount Pictures in Brazil ( Special Edition for Collector ) that shamefully does not have subtitles in Portuguese . I can read and understand English , but most of the Brazilian population does not . Therefore it is a complete lack of respect from this major distributor . Title ( Brazil ) : " Trocando as Bolas "

The story is very intelligent and realistic , reaching characters of different ages to show the crisis that most of the persons pass along their lives in their relationship with their mates . Whose teenager has never had a passion for a man or woman , like the character of Francesca ? And the doubts and insecurity about fatherhood or motherhood , like Carlos , Giulia , Adriano and Livia ? And the love jealousy , like Paolo ? And the middle age crisis , like Anna ? Therefore , the story certainly catch a phase in the life of the viewer himself or herself , and he or she will certainly identify the situation of a character as his or her own .

The life of Rusty changes when she participates and wins a contest to be the cover page of the Vanity magazine . She is invited to work in a huge theater in Broadway , whose owner proposes her . She loses her happiness and starts drinking in her new life style , missing the love of Danny and her old friends . ' Cover Girl ' is a delightful romantic comedy , very naive and having magnificent parts , such as the beauty and talented Rita Hayworth dancing , singing and acting ; Gene Kelly , specially in two scenes , dancing with himself and with Rusty and Genius on the street ; the songs and the choreography of the dances are also spectaculars . Danny , the character of Gene Kelly , is almost nasty with his chauvinist behavior . Rita Hayworth surprised me with her talent : I found her amazing in ' Gilda ' , but she is stunning in ' Cover Girl ' . In accordance with the information on the cover of the VHS , ' Cover Girl ' was the first musical where the songs were part of the plot , giving continuity to the story , instead of just being ' thrown ' in the movie . My sixteen years old son saw this movie with a friend of the same age in a recent Gene Kelly festival and they loved ' Cover Girl ' , therefore I dare to say that this classic is recommended to any movie lover and not only to the old generations . Title ( Brazil ) : ' Modelos ' ( ' Models ' )

The journey of Frodo Baggins and his friends in this movie is again outstanding , stunning , a masterpiece . I believe there is nothing else to be said about this fantastic movie . The eleven Oscars , the IMDB User rating of 9 , 0 with 62 , 820 votes and the 2 , 219 reviews are sufficient . I just want to record my enthusiasm with such a film . Unfortunately the same did not happen with the sequence of Matrix , where the first film was excellent , but the sequences were very disappointing .

The awesome " Slumdog Millionaire " is one of the best movies I have recently seen . The story is an original and simple tale of love , serendipity and fortune , in the environment of poverty and criminality in the slums and streets of India ; but the screenplay is fantastic , using flashbacks to disclose the life of the lead character , his brother and his passionate and pure love for another orphan in a perfect development of the characters and the plot . The acting is top-notch , and the boys and girls that perform the lead roles ( young Jamal , Salim and Latika ) have also amazing performances .

He sees that something has fallen on their chicken house and killed two chickens , and he brings the circular object home . On the next morning , Cleci reads on the news that a Sputnik is missing and might have fallen on Earth . Based on the picture of the satellite , they conclude that the object is the sputnik . Anastácio sneaks out of the house with the object and goes to the bank Caixa Econômica Federal to pledge the object and raise some money to repair the chicken house . However , the attendant Dorinha ( Neide Aparecida ) calls her boy-friend Nelson ( Cyl Farney ) that works in the newspaper Tribuna da Cidade under the pseudonym Jacinto Boucha , covering the social column , and he sees the chance of a scoop that could raise his career . However , the snoopy and unethical reporter Alberto ( Alberto Perez ) hears the conversation in an phone extension and releases the news on the front page . Anastácio becomes famous and has an immediate social ascension to the high society , moving to the fancy Copacabana Palace Hotel , while the Russian , North American and French governments send their agents to Brazil to get the sputnik at any cost . This is the fourth time that I have watched " O Homem do Sputnik " , one of the funniest comedies of Brazilian cinema ever . In 1959 , with the Cold War , sputnik and Brigitte Bardot , this movie is a hilarious collection of stereotypes . The sexy and witty Norma Bengell performing BeBe is na amazingly perfect parody of the French actress ; Hamilton Ferreira in the role of a Russian agent and the presently famous Jô Soares ( Joe Soares in 1959 ) performing an American agent chewing gums and swinging while walking are comical . The lines of Oscarito and Zezé Macedo are amusing , and Cyl Farney and Neide Aparecida play the usual good guy and his girl . Title ( Brazil ) : " O Homem do Sputnik " ( " The Man of the Sputnik " )

The romance is very beautiful , showing a tough fight of classes and prejudice in the beginning of the Twentieth Century in Spain . Sarita Montiel is amazingly gorgeous , and have a wonderful chemistry with Raf Vallone . The music score is dated in the present days , but it is still very beautiful , highlighting the title song with the magnificent interpretation of Sarita Montiel . The rare DVD released in Brazil by New Line has many problems mainly with the image , but the distributor issued a warning on the cover advising the consumers about these defects on the available matrix of the film .

John Locke convinces Desmond to invade the hatch , which is protected by Mr . Eko , and not press the button of the computer to see what will happen . This episode is one of the best of the Second Season . Unfortunately , we lovers of " Lost " can see the lack of respect the producers of this stunning series have with the fans . In the USA , the air date of this episode was 24 May 2006 . Therefore , along this period , fans have to wait for the Third Season in a very suspenseful situation , with Jack and his group surrounded by " The Others " and finding the truth about Michael and the death of Ana Lucia and Libby ; John locked inside the hatch without the intention of pushing the button and Mr . Eko in despair outside the hatch . I hope the fate of " Lost " be better than " Angel " and its very disappointing conclusion ( or lack of conclusion ) after five seasons .

François calls his acquaintance , Inspector Charas ( Herbert Marshall ) , and later the reluctant Helene is convinced to tell them what happened . She explains that François had invented a matter transportation apparatus , and while experimenting with himself , a fly entered the chamber , exchanging one hand and the head with him after the transference . " The Fly " is one of my favorite classic movies of the 50's . The story is great , blending romance , sci-fi and horror , and the narrative , through flashback , keeps the mystery alive until the last scene , when the fly with white head is finally found in a spider web screaming for help . I like very much the dialog when Inspector Charas smashes the spider and the fly with a stone , and François tells him that he is as killer as Helene is , since he killed a man-fly and Helene a fly-man . Title ( Brazil ) : " A Mosca da Cabeça Branca " ( " The Fly of the White Head " )

370788	2488512	70959	10.0	A Testimony of the History of Latin America in the 70's	In the early 70's , in Uruguay , the revolutionary group Tupamaro kidnaps an American trainer of torture and the Brazilian consul , and through the interrogation of the abducted American , the big picture of Uruguay ( and other Latin America countries ) is reported . " État de Siege " is a testimony of the history of Latin America in the 70's , during my childhood and adolescence . All the democratic governments elected by people were discharged through coup d'état by military dictatorships supported by the American government , the police and military forces trained in tortures by American advisors , student and union leaderships destroyed and revolutionary groups unsuccessfully fighting against the dictatorial regime . The fantastic director Costa Gravas exposes this serious wound in Latin America and this denunciation shall never be forgotten by the next generations . This movie remains amazingly real and important , sometimes recalling a documentary . Only this month this film was released on DVD in Brazil , and it is a worthwhile investment . Title ( Brazil ) : ' Estado de Sítio " ( " State of Siege " )

371038	2488512	51790	10.0	A Sequel That Is Another Masterpiece	In 1564 , Ivan , The Terrible ( Nicolai Cherkasov ) , is feeling alone : his wife , friend and great companion was poisoned and his best friend , Prince Andreu Kurbsky ( Mikhail Nazvanov ) has betrayed him and delivered some Russian cities to Poland . Trying to have somebody to believe , he promotes Archbishop Philip ( Andrei Abrikosov ) to the highest authority of the church in the city of Moscow . Then , the story presents lot of treason in his court and a great revenge . This movie is so remarkable as ' Part I ' is . The photography , lights and shadows in black and white are again a piece of art . There are at least twenty minutes in color , and in my opinion t would be better off being only in black and white . The sumptuous scenarios are amazing , plenty of details and very luxury , and the story is a sequel of an epic . The direction and the performance of the cast are outstanding , making this movie another unforgettable masterpiece and highly recommended . However , it is necessary to watch the ' Part I ' first , otherwise the viewer will not understand the story .
