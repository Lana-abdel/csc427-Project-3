369691	2488512	281865	1.0	Awful	Today I have lost about two hours of my Saturday afternoon watching this crap . This trash is so awful and ridiculous that does not deserve my review . It is enough to read the summary of other IMDb users : - No toilet bowl is large enough to hold the crap this movie produces - Avoid this movie at all costs - So Unfunny - This movie is so bad the producers would not let it be released into theaters - The worst movie I've ever seen . . . - Avoid at all costsTitle ( Brazil ) : ' As Aventuras de Frank McKlusky ' ( ' The Adventures of Frank McKlusky ' )
371816	2488512	808279	1.0	Did I Press the Replay Button of the Original " Funny Games " ?	In 1997 , Michael Haneke became worldwide known with his masterpiece of sadism , alienation and cruelty " Funny Games " and I recall how disturbed I was after watching that impressive movie . " Funny Games U . S . " has just been released on DVD in Brazil , and I have decided to check what this version could present to the viewers . The answer : absolutely nothing but the language , spoken in English , and the cast . The performances of Naomi Watts , Michael Pitt , Brady Corbet , Devon Gearhart and Tim Roth are outstanding , but they have added no value to the original movie since it is a remake frame by frame of the original film , giving me the sensation that I pressed the replay button of the original " Funny Game " . Does it worth to remake a movie just to satisfy viewers that can not read subtitles and to fill the pockets of the author ? Title ( Brazil ) : " Violência Gratuita " ( " Free Violence " )
369710	2488512	1213644	1.0	The Perfect Title	In general , parody movies are entertaining and recommended when the viewer is upset , expecting to shutdown the brain and laugh with silly jokes . That was my expectation with when I selected " Disaster Movie " on DVD this Friday . Unfortunately this flick is AWFUL and I was incapable of laughing during the long 88 minutes running time . With the due respect the retards deserve , the " directors " and " writers " of this crap certainly have mental or education issues ( or both ) , and I can not imagine how someone sane can produce and put money in this terrible production . The only thing that works perfectly is the original title of this disastrous flick . My vote is one ( awful ) . Title ( Brazil ) : " Super-Heróis , A Liga da Injustiça " ( " Superheroes , The League of the Injustice " )
369226	2488512	382011	2.0	A Complete Mess	Rebecca Haster ( Taturn Adair ) blames herself for the death of her parents and decides to spend sometime alone in the lakeside cottage of her parents in Rushford Lake . She meets Stan James ( Timothy Prindle ) on the road and gives a lift to the stranger . Later they become friends , while Rebecca sees supernatural events with drowned people in the lake . While searching the accidents in the library , she finds that mysterious deaths happen in the spot every thirteen years . I bought this DVD without any previous reference and only based on its creepy cover , since I love zombie movies . Unfortunately , this film is simply awful , with a messy and flawed screenplay . I have no problems with low budget movies with simple special effects , but with good story , direction and performances and this is not the case of " Ghost Lake " . Further , I am not moralist but the lead character Rebecca has the behavior of a slut , having casual sex with two strangers in a couple of days and while grieving the death of her parents . Title ( Brazil ) : " O Retorno dos Mortos " ( " The Return of the Dead " )

" ) While in London in their honeymoon , Rosy and Oskar disclose the real intentions of a voyeur . Tinto Brass writes , directs and edits six erotic tales of extremely bad taste and low level . My first impression is that this film was cast in the red light district , in a brothel or in the porn industry . Most of the " actresses " shows cellulite and have flaccid bodies , or are simply wasted . I do not know the target audience of this crap , but I believe that even the most fanatic fan of Tinto Brass will be disappointed . Title ( Brazil ) : " Faça Isto ! " ( " Do It ! " )
370648	2488512	372873	3.0	Disappointing and Lame	In accordance with a Korean legend , every five hundred years , a woman protected by a man transforms in a serpent to fight against a dragon in a battle between good and evil . In Los Angeles of the present days , after a mysterious accident , the reporter Ethan Kendrick ( Jason Behr ) recalls his meeting fifteen years ago with Jack ( Robert Forster ) , who owned an antique shop and told him that he was the one supposed to protect Sarah Daniels ( Amanda Brooks ) . Ethan seeks out Sarah and together they fight to survive and destroy the devilish dragon . " D-War " is a disappointing movie , with a lame story of the director and writer Hyung-rae Shim associated to a terrible acting of the unexpressive lead couple . The screenplay is ridiculous and boring , supported by reasonable special effects only and together with the art of the cover of the DVD , they are the best offered by this feature . Title ( Brazil ) : " D-War ? Guerra dos Dragões " ( " D-War ? War of Dragons " )
370572	2488512	202314	3.0	Awful : Predictable and Full of Clichés	Brian Goodman ( Craig Sheffer ) is a scientist specialized in drilling operations . He aborts a dangerous perforation , leaded by Alan Morrisey ( Harry Van Gorkun ) and Darryl Simmons ( James Russo ) and destroys the whole project and facilities . A few years later , he is working with his friends Sam Dalton ( Bruce McGill ) and Rodney Bedecker ( Wil Wheaton , from Star Trek ) , when he detects an abnormal movement of the tectonic plates , provoked by Alan's new enterprise . Brian meets Alan , and together with Allison Saunders ( Terry Farrel ) , a highly graduated scientist from MIT , try to stop the movement of underground layers of Earth . This flick is awful : very predictable and full of clichés . The characters are badly developed , the story is horrible and it does not work . The best part is the ironical dialog of a married couple , asking for information in a road bar . The Brazilian distributors called it ' Catastrophe ' , maybe a hint regarding the terrible quality of this film . Title ( Brazil ) : ' Catástrofe ' ( ' Catastrophe ' )
371841	2488512	810988	3.0	Overrated and Pretentious Mess	Part One : The Prisoner ? In Los Angeles , the television actor Gary ( Ryan Reynolds ) accidentally burns his house while burning the belongings of his ex-girlfriend . Then he drives drinking booze , uses crack and capsizes his car . He is sentenced to home imprisonment under the surveillance of the public relation Margaret ( Melissa McCarthy ) and befriends and flirts with his neighbor Sarah ( Hope Davis ) . However , weird things happen in the house haunting Gary . Part Two : Reality Television ? The screenplay writer Gavin fires his old friend Melissa , the lead actress of his reality show , following the advice of Susan , who is the liaison with the direction of the network , and finds that he has been betrayed . Part Three : Knowing ? The car of the video game designer Gabriel runs out battery and he leaves his wife Mary and his daughter , seeking a signal in his cellular to call a tow truck . He meets the drifter Susan that tells Gabriel who he is . " The Nines " is an overrated movie , actually a pretentious mess , with three tales entwining the lives of three lead characters . The first part is intriguing , but the other two and the conclusion are awful . Title ( Brazil ) : " Número 9 " ( " Number 9 " )
372331	2488512	139374	3.0	Silly , Naive and Dated	While navigating from Rio de Janeiro to Vitória , the stewards Didi ( Renato Aragão ) and Dedé ( Dedé Santana ) and the inexperienced captain of the passenger vessel Anna Neri flirt with a group of models . In the return trip , Didi and Dedé simulate that the ship is sinking , and with another steward , they kidnap the captain and use a liferaft to go to a desert island with four models . But the island is the hidden place of a dangerous gang of smugglers , jeopardizing the group . " A Ilha dos Paqueras " is a silly , naive and dated Brazilian comedy of 1970 . The unique interest in this movie is historical , once shows Renato Aragão and Dedé Santana in the beginning of their career before the successful " Os Trapalhões " . There are also some images of Rio de Janeiro that worth . The DVD released by Cinemagia / Fantasy distributor has an awful quality of image and sound , and in some moments it is impossible to understand the dialogs , but probably the master is damaged . Title ( Brazil ) : " A Ilha dos Paqueras " ( " The Island of the Flirt Men " )
371502	2488512	453467	3.0	Flawed and Corny	In Algiers , New Orleans , after the explosion of a ferry transporting the sailors from the USS Nimitz and their families with 543 casualties , the lonely AFT agent Doug Carlin ( Denzel Washington ) is assigned to investigate the terrorist attack . Without any lead , he is informed by Sheriff Reed about a corpse of a woman that was found one hour before the explosion , but burnt with the same explosive . He is invited by FBI Agent Pryzwarra ( Val Kilmer ) to join the surveillance team leaded by Jack McCready ( Bruce Greenwood ) in the investigations , using a time window and Einstein-Rosen bridge through seven satellites to look back four and half days in time . He discloses the identity of the mysterious dead woman called Claire Kuchever ( Paula Patton ) and decides to follow her last moments trying to find the criminal . Along the surveillance , Doug falls in love for Claire and tries to change destiny , saving her life . " Déjà Vu " is a great deception , with a flawed , shallow and corny screenplay . The paradoxical story is full of inconsistencies , but the worst is the ridiculous and incoherent conclusion . I like time travel movies , but the plot of this overrated flick is full of holes . I believe the misleading title " Déjà Vu " refers to the role of Denzel Washington , very similar to many others of his movies . Title ( Brazil ) : " Déjàvu "
371709	2488512	489772	4.0	Dumb , Unpleasant , Silly and Shallow	In Maceió , the dysfunctional pothead Roberta ( Mariana Ximenes ) , who was abused by her mates in the elementary school , has a deep hatred against her grandmother Judite ( Laura Cardoso ) because of her treatment in the summer holidays of her childhood and adolescence . She kidnaps Judite and puts her in the trunk of her car ; then she visits her sister Suzana ( Paloma Duarte ) , who is scheduling the birthday party with a clown for her son , and she prepares some shots to dope Judite . While waiting for Suzana on the street , Roberta goes to a bar to calm down drinking whiskey and she meets the dumb lawyer Renato ( Ângelo Paes Leme ) , who has just been stolen . Roberta creates a big mess in the bar and they do not pay the check ; while escaping from the police , she invites Renato to travel with her sister and her to her grandmother's beachside home for the weekend . When Renato discovers that the sisters plot revenge and plan to torture Judite to get even , he tries to convince the girls to call off their plan . Meanwhile , Suzana's husband Francisco ( Thiago Lacerda ) finds the drugs in a desk in his bedroom and decides to chase his wife , believing that Roberta is persuading Suzana to use drugs , getting into serious trouble . " Muito Gelo e Dois Dedos D'Água " has a dumb and unpleasant storyline and screenplay , with one of the most imbecile stories I have ever seen . The motive for the revenge of Roberta and Suzana is not funny ; on the contrary , it is stupid and does not justify their act . The shallow and fool metaphor used for the title of the movie seems to be written by a person with elementary school only . The characters are awful : Roberta is a dysfunctional pothead ; Suzana is an amoral bitch ; Renato is a dumb man with a weak character ; Dr . Francisco is a caricature of a man ; Cleusa is a bitch ; and Judite is not well developed and it is impossible to imagine her as a villain or a child abuser , just an old woman with some silly ideas . The good points are the locations in and nearby Maceió , one of the most beautiful cities in the world , and the great cast leaded by the gorgeous Mariana Ximenes and Paloma Duarte that unfortunately is not able to save with their talents such awful story . Title ( Brazil ) : " Muito Gelo e Dois Dedos D'Água " ( " Lots of Ice and a Little Bit of Water " )
372268	2488512	479884	4.0	Unpleasant Anti-Hero	The hit-man Chev Chelios ( Jason Statham ) is poisoned by the criminal Verona ( Jose Pablo Cantillo ) and his friend and doctor Miles ( Dwight Yoakam ) advises him that he must keep his adrenaline in an upper level to stay alive . Chev meets his girlfriend Eve ( Amy Smart ) and together he looks for Verona to kill him . " Crank " at least in Brazil is one of the blockbusters in every rental and I expected to see a great action movie , since I am a fan of Jason Statham . Unfortunately the film is awful , paced like a video-clip or a video game , but the worst , with an unpleasant anti-hero . The guy kills , threatens , rapes , steals , summarizing , breaks all the rules of a civilized society to survive . In some moments , the situations are funny , but the black humor is supported by a criminal that trespasses the law practically in every action , therefore I personally hated this character . When he dies in the end , I was relieved . In times of great violence worldwide and specifically in my country , I would never like the apology to crime and lack of respect to the law demonstrated by Chev Chelios . The proposed black humor does not work . Title ( Brazil ) : " Adrenalina " ( " Adrenaline " )
369219	2488512	61132	5.0	Too Many Targets ? In the End , Hunger Kills Ideology	Innocenti Totò ( Totò ) and his son Innocenti Ninetto ( Ninetto Davoli ) are drifting in a road in Italy , when they meet a Marxist speaking crow . The trio travels together in a long journey , but when hunger increases , the crow is simply eaten by the drifters . " Uccellacci e Uccellini " is an original and critical surrealistic fable about the fate of the leftist ideology in the view of Pasolini . Although dated , the lead story is good , using the successful style of road-movie of the 50's explored by other Italian directors , like Fellini or Rossellini ; but like a machine gun , Pasolini shots everywhere making the plot diffused , confused and sometimes boring . Totò has good performance , but Ninetto Davoli in his debut is very silly , with a forced smile on his face . The DVD released in Brazil by the minor Brazilian distributor Mediagroup is surprisingly good , presenting restored image and having lots of extras inclusive a documentary of 28 minutes running time about Pier Paolo Pasolini . There is a mistake in the Audio Menu : the 5 . 1 option shows indeed the movie with comments in Italian . But this minor mistake does not diminish the value of the Brazilian DVD . Title ( Brazil ) : " Gaviões e Passarinhos " ( " Hawks and Sparrows " )
372232	2488512	491005	5.0	Mad Cow Disease Makes Ravens Intelligent	On the last working day of Sheriff Wayne ( Sean Patrick Flanery ) , his small town is attacked by blood thirsty ravens that eat human flesh . Meanwhile his wife Cynthia ( Kristin Booth ) visits a farm where a Mennonite family lives to say farewell to her friend Gretchen ( Megan Park ) and discloses a dark secret about the origin of the fierce ravens . " Kaw " is entertaining , but the plot is quite ridiculous . The explanation that the ravens had eaten flesh of cattle with mad cow disease could explain their aggressive behavior or they hunger for flesh ; but the ravens are smart , using for example stones to break the windows of the school bus , and the scientific conclusion is that mad cow disease makes raven intelligent . That is too much , isn't it ? Title ( Brazil ) : Not Available
370111	2488512	1065092	5.0	Silly , but Very Entertaining Adventure	In India , the backpackers American friends Gina ( Emma Catherwood ) , John ( Cian Barry ) , Stacy ( Lisa Livingstone ) , Geraldine ( Jane Perry ) and Phil ( Michael Smiley ) hike in the woods with their guide Brian ( Mike Rogers ) . When Geraldine is bitten by a poisonous spider , the group decides to seek an American doctor that lives in the jungle in a tribe . Dr . Lecorpus ( Lance Henriksen ) treats the girl and while Gina , John and Phil return to the village in the civilization , Brian and Stacy stay with the native . They decide to visit a temple in the forest while waiting for the recovering of Stacey ; however , they find a dark secret about the evil Dr . Lecorpus . " In the Spider's Web " is a silly , but very entertaining adventure . It is funny to see the short clothes that Gina wears in the jungle , very adequate for a place with vegetation , mosquitoes , bugs and spiders ; or to discover that spider's web is combustible , and a torch provokes fire with explosion ; or that a person should shout in a cave while chased by men armed with daggers . But in the end , this movie was better than I expected and I liked it . Title ( Brazil ) : " Aranhas Assassinas " ( " Assassin Spiders " )
370000	2488512	381849	5.0	Absurd , Corny , Incoherent and Overrated	The rancher Daniel Evans ( Christian Bale ) , who lost part of his leg in the Civil War , is broken and owing a large amount to a powerful man in Bisbee . When the outlaw Ben Wade ( Russell Crowe ) is captured after the heist of a stagecoach , Dan offers to escort the cold blood killer to the city of Contention to take the 3 : 10 PM train to Yuma to be sent to trial . In return , he would receive US$ 200 , 00 , enough to save his land and give a better life to his family . During their journey , Ben gets closer to Dan while his gang of criminals follows the group to rescue their boss . The deceptive " 3 : 10 to Yuma " has an absurd and incoherent plot and is absolutely overrated in IMDb . Indeed I can not understand how many viewers do not see how illogical this movie is ( maybe influenced by the positive marketing ) . I am a big fan of Christian Bale , I like Russell Crowe a lot , and actually their performances are top-notch as usual . Regarding the Hollywoodian bad guy Ben Wade , he is a cold blood killer and leader of mean criminals . However , along their journey , he has feelings for Dan in a ridiculously corny situation ; he runs and jumps over the roofs and alleys without any explanation to help Dan to reach the station ; in the climax , he kills his own loyal men that had risked their lives to save him . Regarding Dan Evans , he leaves his wife and sons in a dangerous trip just to raise money ; however , he neither accepts the offer of Ben ( ok , it would be corruption and not compatible to a good guy ) nor the money of the railroad agent when they are under siege in the hotel with a dreadful perspective of survival . Last but not the least , he runs and jumps very well with only one foot . Why the good guy did not kill the arrogant and cruel Ben Wade along the incidental trip ? Maybe the most ridiculous situation is Byron McElroy ( Peter Fonda ) , who was shot in the stomach , riding a horse on the next day . Title ( Brazil ) : " Os Indomáveis " ( " The Indomitable " )
371428	2488512	319495	5.0	Trespassers Will Be Eaten	While returning to Los Angeles in a trailer through the desert , the driver Neil ( Brent Taylor ) convinces his friends Tara ( Ashley Elizabeth ) , Harmony ( Danna Brady ) , Loopz ( Aaron Buer ) , Michelle ( Jessica Osfar ) , Lee ( Ryan De Rouen ) and Cashie ( Kelsey Wedeen ) to take a detour to an isolated mine where it could have a plantation of peyote . The owner of a gas station advises the group to not go to the place , but the stubborn Neil does not pay attention to his words . While driving in a secondary road , Neil sees a girl and wrecks the car in a rock . He decides to walk back to the gas station to call a tow truck , while Michelle and Lee climb a hill trying to get signal to their cell phones . Sooner the teenagers find that they are under siege of a group of sadistic deformed cannibals and they have to fight to survive . " Detour " is a teen rip-off of " The Hills Have Eyes " , using the same storyline but with many silly dialogs and situations . I like horror movies , and " Detour " is not among the worse that I have seen , having beautiful and sexy actresses and a good conclusion with the scary little girl in the best scene of the movie . Unfortunately the annoying character Loopz spoils what could be worthwhile in this movie , plagiarizing the way of speaking of Eminen and having imbecile lines and attitudes . In a certain moment I was so irritated with this actor that I almost stopped the DVD . The screenplay is very weak , without suspense or tension . If you have not seen this movie yet , better off watching " The Hills Have Eyes " instead . Title ( Brazil ) : " Detour - Rota 666 " ( " Detour - Route 666 " )
370352	2488512	539407	5.0	The Dark Past of Phoebe	Phoebe is attacked by some invisible force , and Leo advises that it might be some signal from her past life . Phoebe casts a spell to live her former life , and she discloses that she was evil . Her boyfriend Anton was a warlock that wanted to kill her cousins and good witches Prue and Piper to steal their powers . Phoebe finds also that she used an amulet to protect herself against her cousins . " Pardon My Past " is a silly episode of " Charmed " , with a weak explanation for the attack to Phoebe . Further , how Leo could be Piper's lover if he died in World War I ? Title ( Brazil ) : " Desculpe-me Pelo Meu Passado " ( " Sorry for My Past " )
370718	2488512	539451	5.0	The Guardians of the Bad Guys	Piper and Leo have vanished for one month , and Piper and Prue are wondering if they will ever come back . When the sisters save Darryl from the killer Emilio Smith , the prosecutor Cole Turner builds a case with the testimony of Phoebe . However , Judge William Hamilton uses the pretext of the missing weapon to release the criminal . Piper returns with Leo , and he proposes her . When Emilio attacks Cole , Prue and Phoebe save him , and in the court the Halliwell sisters find that Guardians are protecting the bad guys . In this Third Season , the mysterious new character of Cole Turner is introduced and I believe this is the greatest attraction of this show . In this moment , the questions certainly are if he is a good or a bad guy , and what are his objectives . The story has the usual flaws and silly lines , but entertains . Title ( Brazil ) : " Acabou a Lua de Mel " ( " The Honeymoon Is Over " )
372201	2488512	303990	6.0	Mafia War	When the mobster Iwaida Nishikawi is executed by the hit man Takeshi , his family chases the killer . Takeshi's brothers Takashi and Hideshi Miwa try to find Takeshi , who is hidden with the nurse Rie Ishibashi , to protect him and Hideshi discovers that Takeshi was secretly sent by their Yakuza boss to eliminate Iwaida . Meanwhile , the mobster Kenmoshi abducts Takashi's wife Mariko and rapes her , trying to force Takashi to deliver his brother to him . " Family " is a reasonable movie of Yakuza war directed by Takashi Miike . However , the screenplay is very confused and there is no conclusion of the story that ends with Hideshi seeking his brother Takeshi . There are also flashbacks of the Miwa family and I am not sure whether this film is a sequel with a sequence not released in Brazil . The acting is excellent and the violent scenes are very well choreographed in unusual angles . Title ( Brazil ) : " Cena Mafiosa " ( " Mobster Scene " )
368620	2488512	312603	6.0	Reasonable Pilot of a Show	In 2084 , a nuclear war wasted Earth , making the sky red of chemicals and the former United States of America becomes Deathlands . Breeds of mutants and half-mutants share what was left on Earth with humans . The vile of " Front Royale " is ruled by a good man , but he is killed by his wife Lady Rachel Cawdor ( Traci Lords ) , and his evil son Harvey Cawdor kills one of his brothers and blinds one eyes of his fifteen years old brother Ryan , who escapes . Twenty years later , the one-eyed leader Ryan Cawdor ( Vincent Spano ) returns to " Front Royale " with his girlfriend and half-mutant Krysty Worth ( Jenya Lano ) , his human friend and specialist in weapons JB Dix ( Cliff Saunders ) and the teenage mutant Jak Laurent ( Nathan Carter ) to face his brother and his stepmother . " Deathlands " is another entertaining post-apocalyptic story à la " Mad Max " and probably a pilot of a show . In spite of the bad reviews , I found this low-budget movie very reasonable and in the end I liked it . The lead character Ryan Cawdor recalls Snake Plissken , from " Escape from New York " and " Escape from L . A " and the red-haired Jenya Lano is very gorgeous . Title ( Brazil ) : " Deathlands ? Terra em Fogo " ( " Deathlands ? Earth on Fire " )
371325	2488512	373051	6.0	Entertaining Adventure	Professor Trevor Anderson ( Brendan Fraser ) receives his teenager nephew Sean Anderson ( Josh Hutcherson ) that will spend ten days with him while his mother Elizabeth Anderson ( Jane Wheeler ) prepares to move to Canada . She gives a box to Trevor that belonged to his missing brother Max Anderson and Trevor finds a book with references to the last journey of his brother . He decides to follow the steps of Max with Sean and they travel to Iceland , where they meet the guide Hannah Ásgeirsson ( Anita Briem ) . While climbing a mountain , there is a thunderstorm and they protect themselves in a cave . However , a lightening collapses the entrance and the trio is trapped in the cave . They seek an exit and falls in a hole , discovering a lost world in the center of the Earth . This nth version of the classic novel of Jules Verne is an entertaining adventure . The characters are nice and there is a strong chemistry between Brendan Fraser and the unknown Anita Briem . However , the strongest part of this enjoyable movie is certainly the special effects . I have just seen this movie on DVD , but for those viewers that saw it in 3D in the movie theaters , the impact was certainly bigger and bigger . Title ( Brazil ) : " Viagem ao Centro da Terra " ( " Journey to the Center of the Earth " )
370995	2488512	572251	6.0	Contaminating a Pre-Warp Culture	Captain Archer , Reed and Hoshi returns from a period of observation of a pre-warp civilization split in a war . Lieutenant Reed notes that he lost his communicator somewhere in the planet , and together with Archer , they return to a tavern where his scanner indicates the location . However , they are captured by militaries that have found the unknown technology and imprisoned in a military compound . Meanwhile , Trip and Travis try to find the means to activate the cloak of a Suliban ship to rescue their friends in the hostile planet . I did not like the predictable " The Communicator " episode . The story is silly and the preoccupation of the contamination of a pre-warp culture is not applied when the rescue team fights against the militaries . Further , the capture of Reed with a weapon is worse than lost of a simple communication apparatus . In my point of view , this episode is not well resolved in spite of the explanation of T'Pol in the end . Title ( Brazil ) : " O Comunicador " ( " The Communicator " )
371015	2488512	497465	6.0	Summer in Barcelona	The conventional Vicky ( Rebecca Hall ) , who is engaged of Doug ( Chris Messina ) , travels to Barcelona for summer vacations in the house of their parent's friends Judy ( Patricia Clarkson ) and Mark Nash ( Kevin Dunn ) with her unconventional and open-minded friend Cristina ( Scarlett Johansson ) . While in a restaurant , the divorced painter Juan Antonio Gonzalo ( Javier Bardem ) flirts and invites them to travel to Oviedo with him , and also to go to bed with him . The reluctant Vicky does not accept the invitation but Cristina says yes and Vicky travels with her girlfriend . Once in Oviedo , Cristina has a crisis of ulcer and Vicky goes to sightseeing with Juan Antonio ; then they go to his father's house and later they go to a guitar concert . Vicky falls in love with Juan Antonio and has sex with him . However , back in Barcelona , she does not tell anything to her friend and Cristina moves to Juan Antonio's house , while Vicky marries Doug . When the unstable former wife of Juan Antonio , Maria Elena ( Penélope Cruz ) , has an OD , the painter brings her to his house and their troubled relationship harmonizes with the presence of Cristina , living a threesome . When Cristina asks for a time to travel to Paris and rethink their relationship , Vicky feels in doubt about her sentimental love . I had a great expectation with " Vicky Cristina Barcelona " , first because I am a great fan of Woody Allen , and also because of the Oscar of Penélope Cruz . Unfortunately I found this movie overrated , pretentious and annoying , with excessive narrative in off . The performance of Penélope Cruz is great , as usual , but not to be nominated and win an Oscar . Rebecca Hall has a better and better performance in this movie and Vicky is the most credible character . I like Scarlett Johansson very much , but I believe she needs to give a break in filming with Woody Allen , since her way of speaking and gestures are repetitive , like a female alter-ego of this director . Further , the yellow hair is awful . Title ( Brazil ) : " Vicky Cristina Barcelona "
371452	2488512	572262	6.0	Troubled Leave	The Enterprise finally arrives in planet Risa where the crew will have a leave for resting . T'Pol stays in the ship , while Captain Archer rents an apartment at the sea shore and intends to read ; Travis intends to climb a very difficult mountain that moves ; Commander Tucker and Lieutenant Reed seek out females in a club ; and Hoshi intends only to practice her skills in languages without the use of a computer translator . Meanwhile Dr . Phlox intends to hibernate for two days in Enterprise . However , their plans fail and Travis has an accident and breaks his leg ; Dr . Phlox is awakened to give medical assistance to Travis ; Trip and Reed are trapped and robbed by thieves ; and Archer meets an attractive woman that actually is a Tandaran interested in his knowledge of Sulibans . Only Hoshi has good-time with a handsome and gentle alien . " Two Days and Two Nights " shows the troubled two days of leave of some members of Enterprise . The story should be a comedy , but it does not work well and becomes very silly and predictable . Title ( Brazil ) : " Dois Dias e Duas Noites " ( " Two Days and Two Nights " )
371221	2488512	1204979	6.0	Decent Prequel	In 2004 , the redneck managers of the Meadow View Motel Gordon ( David Moscow ) and Reece ( Brian Klugman ) use room 6 to videotape the intimacy of the guests to sell porn movies . When the mysterious Mr . Smith ( Scott G . Anderson ) checks in with a young woman , they witness the sadistic psychopath guest stabbing and killing his mate . The footage is a success and they decide to make other snuff movies with Smith . When Caleb ( Trevor Wright ) , who is traveling from Chicago with his fiancée Jessica ( Agnes Bruckner ) and his best friend Tanner ( Arjay Smith ) , decides to rest in Meadow View , they have a nightmarish night and try to survive from the sick intention of the gang . The underrated " Vacancy 2 : The First Cut " is a decent prequel to the original " Vacancy " ( which is also a reasonable movie , nothing more than that ) . There are some stupid scenes , like for example Jessica beating on the window instead of escaping ; or the attitude of Tanner in the house of Otis and Doris ; or the conclusion with the police finding no evidence of the murders ; but the final result is not bad or mediocre like mentioned in some reviews . The screenplay and the story could be better but work on DVD . Title ( Brazil ) : " Temos Vagas 2 - The First Cut " ( " Vacancy 2 : The First Cut " )
371976	2488512	572211	6.0	A Matter of Revenge	Captain Archer is contacted by Admiral Forrest asking him to turn back to investigate a distress call from the cargo freighter ECS Fortunate . Archer finds that the freighter had been attacked by the Nausicaans , a race of space pirates . Archer provides supplies , manpower and medical assistance to First Officer Matthew Ryan , who is in command since the captain is injured . When T'Pol detects an alien form in the ship , the reaction of Ryan is violent and the Enterprise discovers that the officer is plot revenge against the Nausicaans , jeopardizing the space route for other freighters . " Fortunate Son " is the weakest episode of this good series so far . The story of revenge of Officer Ryan is silly and pointless , since the guy is not totally wrong . The Nausicaans are pirates and attack the freighters , and the Starfleet does not take any action , therefore his attitude of despair seems to be very reasonable . The moral message of this episode in the end is blurred . Title ( Brazil ) : " Mercadores do Espaço " ( " Merchants of Space " )
371986	2488512	191115	6.0	Delightfully Naive and Silly	The government employee and family man Felismino Tinoco ( Oscarito ) is awarded with one million in his job due to his assiduity , and his colleagues force him to go to a night-club to celebrate the prize . The showgirl Arlete ( Sonia Mamede ) and her smalltime crook boyfriend decide to steal the money from the naive Felismino , plotting a scheme with a fake murder and then blackmailing Felismino . When his greedy family finds that her earned the prize , his wife and his mother-in-law decide to spend the money in luxury . Meanwhile , his smart niece Sueli ( Miriam Teresa ) discloses the fraud and she is kidnapped by the bandit . This chanchada is delightfully naive and silly , but has action and many funny lines , specially for Brazilians . Following the standard of this popular Brazilian musical comedy of the 40's and 50's , there are many critics hidden in the jokes that are still valid in 2007 . The civil servant awarded with a huge prize just because he is never absent of his work ; when he believes that the police is chasing him , he comments that he does not have parliamentary immunity ; the consumption dream of the financially repressed middle-class , these are only some samples of a sharp criticism to the ethics and behavior of our society . Unfortunately the VHS released in Brazil has troubles with the sound in many parts , being impossible to understand many dialogs . Title ( Brazil ) : " Esse Milhão É Meu " ( " This Million Is Mine " )
370361	2488512	360009	6.0	An Only Reasonable David Mamet's Movie	Scott ( Val Kilmer ) is an agent of the American secret service assigned to investigate the kidnapping of the daughter of a high member of the US Government . What seemed to be a traffic of white slaves discloses a darker plot . " Spartan " is quite a deception , considering that was written and directed by David Mamet . The characters are not well developed , and in the beginning is hard to understand that Scott is not a military , but a secret agent . Further , for a cold guy like him , I have not understood how he gets involved with the abduction situation of Laura Newton ( Kristen Bell ) , and jeopardizes his agents Curtis and Jacqueline ( Jackie Black ) is such a mission . I saw this movie in an American DVD , since it has not been released in Brazil yet , and I found it only reasonable , maybe overrated because of the name of David Mamet . When is mentioned in the movie that the president's daughter was kidnapped ? I did not see this information in any part of the story , only in IMDb comments . Title ( Brazil ) : This movie has not been released yet .
372294	2488512	265104	6.0	Something Does Not Work Well in This Movie . . .	In a near future , the existence of a city of vampires is disclosed to the human race . However , some killings of humans jeopardize the integration of the races . Detective Steve Grant ( Bokeem Wooddbine ) and the vampire Detective Aaron Gray ( Adrien Paul ) join forces investigating the murders . This movie has many essential components to be a great film : a wonderful photography , something between Gothic and noir , recalling ' Dark City ' and even ' Matrix ' ; an intriguing and original plot , discussing the problems of integration of two very different races , which can be extrapolated for the present intolerance in the world ; great costumes , good special effects and some good actors and actresses . However , the screenplay is confused , with an unnecessary romance , and the direction is cold , and in the end , we have a movie without emotion or vibration , basic elements for this type of story . Anyway , it is watchable and is a reasonable entertainment . Title ( Brazil ) : ' Cidade dos Vampiros ' ( ' Vampires City ' )
370615	2488512	60268	6.0	Weird and Bizarre	The wounded criminal Richard " Dicky " ( Lionel Stander ) and his dying partner Albie ( Jack MacGowran ) seek for shelter in an old seaside castle full of chickens and owned by the eccentric and coward American George ( Donald Pleasence ) and his slut French wife Teresa ( Françoise Dorléac ) . While waiting for the rescue of his boss , Albie dies and Dicky develops a strange relationship with the odd couple . The cult and awarded black comedy " Cul-de-sac " is a weird and bizarre movie . I do not know whether this sort of non-sense humor is dated or works for European , but in my concept most of the jokes are not funny . Nevertheless it is worthwhile watching this film , first because it is one of the first works of the great director Roman Polanski , and also because it is one of the last works of Catherine Deneuve's sister Francoise Dorleac , who prematurely died in 1967 when her sports car crashed and burned in Nice , France . Title ( Brazil ) : " Armadilha do Destino " ( " Trap from the Destiny " )
371542	2488512	36241	6.0	Naive Version of the Legend of Billy the Kid	In the Nineteenth Century , in the town of Lincoln , New Mexico , the sheriff Pat Garrett ( Thomas Mitchell ) welcomes his old friend , Doc Holliday ( Walter Huston ) , who has had his horse Red stolen by a stranger while coming to the town . They meet the thieve and realize that the guy is the gunman Billy the Kid ( Jack Beutel ) . Doc becomes friend of Billy , but Pat invites them to leave Lincoln in the afternoon . There is an incident , Pat wounds Billy the Kid , and Doc asks his girlfriend Rio McDonald ( Jane Russell ) to take care of Billy while he would misguide Pat Garret t and his officers . There is a romance between Billy the Kid and Rio , and when the hit-man is healed , he disputes with Doc the possession of Red and Rio , with Pat Garrett chasing them . On 13 July 1881 , this hunting ends in a tragic way . After watching " The Aviator " , I was very curious to see " The Outlaw " , mainly because of the problems of Howard Hughes with the censorship mentioned in Martin Scorcese's film . It is amazing to see on the present days how a simple décolleté could provoke such a reaction in 1943 . Further , presently " The Outlaw " is a very silly western , showing a naive version of the legend of Billy the Kid . The repetitive soundtrack along many dialogs is very boring , and in the presents days this movie could be a parody of westerns movies . It is worthwhile as an entertainment and to satisfy the curiosity rose in " The Aviator " about this polemic work of Howard Hughes . Title ( Brazil ) : " O Proscrito " ( " The Outlaw " )
371308	2488512	157191	6.0	Beautiful Choreography	When the successful artistic director Alex McGrath ( Matthew Walker ) dies , his New York dance company invites three veteran dancers , Travis MacPhearson ( Patrick Swaize ) , Chrissa Lindh ( Lisa Niemi ) and Max Delano ( George De La Pena ) , to exhibit a never performed dance piece called " Without a Word " as a last homage in a benefit show . Along the troubled trio reunion , secrets are disclosed , deep wounds are healed , culminating with their last dance together . " One Last Dance " is certainly a very personal work of Patrick Swaize and mostly of his wife Lisa Niemi , who are producers , writer , director and lead actor and actress . The choreography is very beautiful , with a great music score including two Brazilian songs . Lisa Niemi and Patrick Swaize show that they are in good shape as dancers . Unfortunately , the screenplay is weak , with a sort of soap-opera drama and Lisa Niemi performs a confused character , never clear of her feelings and intentions . If she had a serious situation with Alex , why does she need to dance again ? Travis returned for Chrissa , and Max because he is completely broken . Further , the tearful character Chrissa Lindh is boring in some moments with her insecurity . But the dances make this movie a worthwhile entertainment for those who like this art . Title ( Brazil ) : " A Última Dança " ( " The Last Dance " )
368679	2488512	373926	6.0	Disappointing Commercial Thriller	I heard some good comments about this movie from some colleagues , and I bought the DVD really expecting to see great film . Directed by Sydney Pollack and having Nicole Kidman , Sean Penn and Catherine Keener in the cast , I thought that it would certainly be a great political thriller . Unfortunately I was absolutely wrong . The confused and flawed screenplay does not develop well the characters , the story is very disappointing and commercial and there are very stupid lines , such as when Silvia asks Keller what he does when he can not sleep , and he answers that he stays awake ; or when Dot comes to a stripper in a night-club and asks her to not touch the Prime Minister in a lap dance . What about the secret service leaving the menaced president of a country alone in a room after an attempt against his life ? Why would a citizen and her president together alone speak in English instead of in their native dialect or language ? The conclusion is simply awful and corny , and the alternative ending with worse than the original one . There is a total lack of chemistry between Nicole Kidman and Sean Penn for the insinuated romance arising between them . Nicole Kidman seems to have fixed the awful plastic surgery of her nose , and is very beautiful again in this flick . Last but not the least , it is very weird that many favorable reviews are made by users with only one review issued in IMDb , in a type of apparently fake promotion . Title ( Brazil ) : " A Intérprete " ( " The Interpreter " )
369284	2488512	311429	6.0	Good Cast , Idea and Effects , in a Movie That Does Not Work Well	In 1899 , almost simultaneously , England is attacked by German and vice-versa . The European continent is close to the war due to these events . A group of heroes ? Allan Quartermain ( Sean Connery ) , Captain Nemo ( Naseeruddin Shah ) , the vampire Mina Harker ( Peta Wilson ) , the Invisible Man Rodney Skinner ( Tony Curran ) , Dorian Gray ( Stuart Townsend ) , the American Tom Sawyer and Dr . Jekyll ( Jason Flemyng ) ? are invited by M ( Richard Roxburgh ) to gather and form the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen . Their objective would be fighting against Phantom , the mentor of the aggressions in Europe . Although having good cast and special effects , this movie fails . Somehow it recalled me Will Smith's ' Wild Wild West ' .
369407	2488512	350774	6.0	Funny and Entertaining	While heading to Galveston in a RV for the wedding of a friend , the driver Johnny ( Oz Perkins ) gets lost and arrive in the small town of Lovelock and his friends Kate ( Bianca Lawson ) , Sara ( Ever Carradine ) , Melody ( Gina Phillips ) , Christian ( Jeremy Sisto ) and David ( Erik Palladino ) decide to spend the night in the Bed and Breakfast owned by Mr . Robert Wise ( David Carradine ) . David has an argument with the chef of the inn , Henri ( Diedrich Bader ) , and when the chef is found dead and Mr . Wise has a heart attack in the middle of the night , the local Sheriff ( Jeffrey Dean Morgan ) suspects of the group and asks his assistant Enus ( Mark Kelly ) to take the key of their trailer and stay in Lovelock during the investigation . Then the Sheriff arrests a drifter ( Brent David Fraser ) that becomes his prime suspect . When the clumsy Johnny accidentally breaks a box of Mr . Wise , he releases the fiend Kuman Thong and the evil spirit possesses the locals transforming them into zombies . Matthew Leutwyler certainly wrote and directed " Dead & Breakfast " with the intention of making a cult-movie . Unfortunately his target is never reached , but this gore comedy is funny and a worthwhile entertainment . There are good lines and most of the characters are likable , and one of the best moments if the phone call of the maid of honor Kate to the bride Lisa , with a hilarious dialog . Title ( Brazil ) : " Adivinhe Quem Vem Para Morrer " ( " Guess Who is Coming to Die ? " )
368979	2488512	235712	6.0	Confused and Scary	This story happens thirty years before the first ' Ring ' . It tells , in a dramatic way , the story of Sadako Yamamura ( Yukie Nakama ) when she was a teenager , working on a theater stage as an actress and having a crush in Tôyama ( Seiichi Tanabe ) . The problem is the very confused screenplay and the badly developed characters . I do not know whether the translation to Portuguese along the film is correct . I watched a VHS spoken in Japanese with subtitles in Portuguese , but when I watch a movie in English , I note that there are many mistakes or omissions in the translation to Portuguese . Therefore , I do not know how precise is the translation in the Brazilian VHS . I myself did not understand the story as a whole , but I agree it is scary . I do not dare to say that it is a bad movie , but unfortunately I felt lost in many parts of the plot . In the future , I intend to watch the three Japanese ' Ring ' in sequence , and maybe the story becomes clearer . The actress Yukie Nakama is an amazingly beautiful and delicate young woman . I was astonished with her beauty . Title ( Brazil ) : ' Ring 0 ? O Chamado ? Birthday ' ( ' Ring 0 ? The Calling ? Birthday ' )
370291	2488512	359013	6.0	Reasonable Entertainment , Indicated for Fans of Action Movies	The vampires , leaded by Danica Talos ( Parker Posey ) , rescue Dracula - called Drake ( Dominique Purcell ) - from the depth of the sands of Iraq , and prepare a setup to Blade ( Wesley Snipes ) . The FBI arrests Blade , and the Nightstalkers , an anti-vampire group leaded by Abigail Whistler ( Jessica Biel ) saves him . Together with Hannibal King ( Ryan Reynolds ) , the trio faces the vampires and the powerful Drake . " Blade : Trinity " is a reasonable entertainment , indicated for fans of action movies . There are lots of explosions , car chase , shootings and the usual scenes of this type of film , sometimes looking like a MTV video clip . The first two movies of Blade are better and better , and I personally found this third sequel a little boring . The reference to Iraq , where evil is hiding below the sands of the desert , is terrible . Wesley Snipes is horrible in the role of Blade ; Hannibal King , performed by the ham actor Ryan Reynolds , has many unfunny jokes ; and the best role and parts of the movie belong to the character of Abigail Whistler . Title ( Brazil ) : " Blade Trinity "
370756	2488512	319531	6.0	Back to the Past	After the suicide of the small time drug dealer and thief Davey ( Jonathan Rhys Meyers ) , his brother and former powerful gangster Will Graham ( Clive Owen ) , who is living a peaceful recluse life trying to redeem himself from his past , returns to his homeland to investigate the motives for such desperate act . Will hires an independent autopsy and the coroner informs that Davey had been raped the night before his death . Will returns to his past life seeking for revenge . " I'll Sleep When I'm Dead " is a deceptive thriller with an absolute absence of originality . In spite of having a great cast leaded by Clive Owen , Charlotte Rampling , Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Malcolm McDowell , and a beautiful and stylish cinematography , the screenplay is very weak and confused , with a storyline similar to many other better movies . The characters are badly developed , and who they are and their motives are disclosed in a confused way . Further , the motives of Boad for the stupidity against Davey are unbelievably ridiculous . Title ( Brazil ) : " Vingança Final " ( " Final Revenge " )
369940	2488512	89945	6.0	A Funny Joke with Western Movies	" Rustlers ' Rhapsody " is a homage to Western movies , a sort of Luke Lucky , actually a satire to the Western movies . This film shows all the clichés usually presented in this genre in a funny and laconic way . There are the characters of the bar tender , the corrupt sheriff , the drunkard , the prostitute in the saloon , the powerful farmer , the ' bad guys ' and the ' good guy ' . The acting and the direction are very reasonable and Hugh Wilson is the director of the hilarious " Police Academy " . In the end this movie is a forgettable and funny entertainment indicated for fans of Western flicks . Title ( Brazil ) : " Vaqueiro Cantador " ( " Singer Cowboy " )
369718	2488512	384537	6.0	If You Do not Play the Game , Read the Excellent Explanation of " TensersFloatingDisk " in the Message Board	The little Sharon ( Jodelle Ferland ) is a sleepwalker , who frequently speaks the name " Silent Hill " in her trances . After a research , her stepparents Rose ( Radha Mitchell ) and Christopher da Silva ( Sean Bean ) finds that the place is a ghost town . Rose runs away home with Sharon without the agreement of Christopher , and drives to " Silent Hill " trying to solve the mystery . Along her trip , Rose has an incident in the road with the police officer Cybil Bennett ( Laurie Holden ) , who chases her . She speeds her car and crashes , and Cybil has an accident with her motorcycle . When Rose wakes up , Sharon has vanished and Rose searches her . Later , Cybil joins Rose and they find that they are trapped in the town . Along their investigation , they disclose the dark secret of the place . When I finished watching " Silent Hill " , I had not understood the story . Fortunately , I read the excellent explanation of " TensersFloatingDisk " in the IMDb Message Board and I now can see that the story is good . My conclusion is that the screenplay of Roger Avary is completely flawed , since it is based on the premise that the viewer plays ( or at least knows ) the game . For those like me that do not play the game , the story is absolutely confused . The cinematography , effects , performances and direction are great . Title ( Brazil ) : " Terror Em Silent Hill " ( " Terror in Silent Hill " )
372103	2488512	87909	7.0	Total Cult	In Switzerland , the teenager Jennifer Corvino ( Jennifer Connelly ) , daughter of a famous actor , arrives in an expensive board school and shares her room with the French schoolmate Sophie ( Federica Mastroianni ) . Jennifer is a sleepwalker , is capable of telepathically communicate with insects and has adaptation problem in the new school . While sleepwalking , she meets and becomes friend of a Scottish entomologist , Prof . John McGregor ( Donald Pleasence ) , and his chimpanzee Tonga . Jennifer decides to help the investigation of Dr . McGregor about a serial killer that is killing young girls in that area . It may sound ridiculous , but " Phenomena " has never been released on video in Brazil ; only two days ago , " Phenomena " was released on DVD in Brazil and now I am glad to have this movie in my collection . The weird story of Dario Argento , one of my favorite directors , is a total cult , showing bizarre characters and situations , maggots , flies , deformed people , serial killer and lots of bodies and body parts . A fifteen years old Jennifer Connelly in her third work , extremely beautiful , shines in the very original role of a sleepwalker that is very connected to insects and develop the skill of communicate with them . Daria Nicolodi , the mother of Asia Argento and former mate of Dario Argento , has a minor , but very important role . And the versatile Donald Pleasence , in the role of a paraplegic researcher , is efficient as usual . The music score , with Goblin , Iron Maiden and Motorhead , is another great attraction of this movie . Title ( Brazil ) : " Phenomena "
371558	2488512	572185	7.0	Rebellion in the Prison Carrier	The Enterprise locates the shuttlepod one wandering in the space and Captain Archer and Trip missing . T'Pol finds that they have been mistakenly assumed smugglers by a patrol ship while returning from a visit from a trade post at the planet K'et Enol , arrested and set to the penal colony Canamar . A government representative comes to the Enterprise and travels with the crew to release Archer and Trip and avoid other misunderstandings . However , the prisoner Kuroda and his Nausican partner escape from their handcuffs , dominate the guards and take control of the ship . " Canamar " is a predictable and unoriginal episode , without anything special . Archer uses his intelligence to lure the criminal and control the situation , while the poor Trip has to hear the experiences of the annoying alien . Title ( Brazil ) : " Canamar "
371800	2488512	572192	7.0	Time Travelers From the Future	The Enterprise encounters an alien spacecraft with amicable aliens that will watch the Great Plume of Agosoria , a phenomenon considered religious by them that happen every eleven years , and Archer invite the group to come on board of Enterprise . When a plasma storm hits Enterprise , there is a miracle interrupting a serious cascade failure , preventing the reactor breach and explosion of Enterprise , and Trip finds that someone of the alien group disconnected a cable saving Enterprise . Later , the crewman Daniels tells Archer that he is a time traveler that has come from the future to chase the Sulliban soldier Silik , his opponent in a temporal cold war . " Cold Front " is an engaging episode of this series , but the explanation of Daniels and his motives are very confused . I confess that in the end I did not understand why Silik was the enemy , and why he saved the Enterprise from blowing up . Title ( Brazil ) : " Frente Fria " ( " Cold Front " )
368929	2488512	303858	7.0	Good Canadian Thriller	In Quebec , a serial killer kills , rapes and takes parts of his victims in this sequence . The Detective Maude Graham ( Maude Guérin ) , a lonely woman and very efficient detective , is in charge of the investigation . She uses the media to tease the criminal , and acts like a bait to find the unknown assassin . " Le Collectionneur " is a good Canadian thriller . The story and the characters are very well constructed , and Luc Picard is excellent in the role of a deranged serial killer . I regret only that the VHS distributed in Brazil is ( horribly ) dubbed in English . I do not understand why the distributor spoils many films with dubbed copies . They claim that there are many illiterate people , who do not know or have difficulties to read the subtitles , but anyway speaking is part of the acting and therefore is unacceptable such a procedure of dubbing the original language . Title ( Brazil ) : " O Colecionador " ( " The Collector " )
372416	2488512	303373	7.0	Touching a Serious Social Wound	In Chicago , the Afro-American teenager friends Lloyd Newman ( Brandon Hamond ) and LeAlan Jones ( Roderick Pannell ) win a contest promoted by the successful producer Dave Isay ( Josh Charles ) of NPR ? National Public Radio ? for a documentary about the daily life in the ghetto where they live . They prepare a documentary showing their routines , the life in their neighborhood , and it becomes controversial , with some negative reviews of important persons of their community . Nevertheless , they are awarded as the 1997 Chicago Citizen of the Year . Dave becomes a close friend of the boys and their families , and they decide to prepare another documentary about the death of Eric Morse , a young kid dropped from the 14th floor of a building in the compound by two other boys on 14 Nov 1994 . They win the prestigious Peabody Award with their work . " Our America " is a good movie based on a true story and is about the dramatic situation of many poor people living in ghettos and slums . The story happens in North America , but it could have happened in any country in South America , Afrika , Asia , and even Europe . I liked this film because it touches a serious wound , the social debt of the society with many persons . Further , it is not corny , but it gives some hope , when we see two boys like Lloyd and LeAlan having a chance to improve their lives . It emphasizes the importance of friendship and sympathy , to help those who need . Title ( Brazil ) : " Território Violento " ( " Violent Territory " )
371135	2488512	104700	7.0	When an Honest Man Finds Corruption in the Breast of His Family	In Chicago , Zach Resnick ( Michael Ontkean ) is an honest detective from homicide department , working in a case of murder of a director in front of a restaurant . He finds that the target was indeed a prominent politician . While investigating , he realizes that his father , the policeman Abraham Resnick ( Martin Landau ) , is a dirty cop and is involved in the crime . He faces a great dilemma , causing serious problems to him . This film has a good story , which could be improved . The performance of Michael Ontkean , Martin Landau and Eli Wallach are very convincing , and the jazz in the soundtrack recalls the atmosphere of those film-noir of the 30s and 40s . Title ( Brazil ) : ' Legado de Mentiras ' ( ' Legacy of Lies ' )
370174	2488512	435670	7.0	Promising Original Idea , Unfortunately Wasted in a Corny and Implausible Romantic Situation	In Burnaby , Nick Powell ( Justin Chatwin ) is an excellent high-school student that raises money selling homeworks and results of quizzes to his schoolmates . He aims to travel secretly London to have a course of writer and he tells his best friend is Pete Egan ( Chris Marquette ) that he has already bought the airplane ticket but he has not told to his mother yet . Meanwhile the punk and smalltime thief Annie Newton ( Margarita Levieva ) has a problem with Pete , who owes money to her . Nick pays the debts of his friend and the angry Annie attacks Nick in the messroom . In the night , Annie and her boyfriend Marcus Bohem ( Alex O'Loughlin ) that is in parole rob a car and Annie breaks a jewelry window and steals the exposed jewels . When Annie tells Marcus that she will not share her theft , he anonymously denounces Annie to the police . The police go to the high-school and open Annie's locker , and the girl assumes that Pete has rat her . Later Annie and her gang attack Pete and the coward teenager to protect himself tells that actually Nick has called the police ; then the raged trio chases Nick and beats him to death , dumping his body in a sewer . On the next morning , Nick goes to school and finds that he is actually a spirit , invisible for people . Further , he tries to communicate with the living to find his body since he is still alive . " The Invisible " has a promising original idea of a spirit in limbo while his body is in coma . The beginning of this movie is excellent and without clichés and developed in an adequate pace and good development of characters . However , the writer in a certain moment wastes the plot with a corny and implausible romantic situation . How could a handsome teenager that has no problem with girls fall in love for the girl that tried to kill him a couple of days ago ? This dull situation really spoiled the movie since it is not believable . Pete is one of the most despicable characters I have recently seen in a movie . At least , the writer gives a decent conclusion in the end and Annie has the deserved fate . Title ( Brazil ) : " O Invisível " ( " The Invisible " )
372249	2488512	190524	7.0	A Good Religious Story Even for Atheistic	While traveling in an airplane , the GNN journalist Buck Williams ( Kirk Cameron ) and the airline pilot Rayford Steele ( Brad Johnson ) note that many passengers mysteriously vanished . When they land , they realize that the disappearance of children and some adults is a worldwide happening . Later , Rayford finds that these events are described in the Holy Bible and indeed those who stay on earth were left behind , and the Antichrist will born on the next years . Although having a screenplay a little confused and being boring in some parts , ' Left Behind ' is a good movie , and has an intelligent story . In accordance with the Extras on the DVD , the best seller ' Left Behind ' is the most sold and one of the top ten of the Twentieth Century . I believe that religious persons will love this movie , but even atheistic will like it . Title ( Brazil ) : ' Deixados Para Trás ' ( ' Left Behind ' )
369826	2488512	245562	7.0	A Good but Predictable War Movie	In 1943 , Joe Enders is a traumatized and hurt soldier , who lost all the men under his command when following the instruction to defend a certain spot . After a period in a military hospital , he is promoted to sergeant with the ungrateful assignment of protecting the radio-operator Navajo private marine Ben Yahzee ( Adam Beach ) . In accordance with this movie , in the Second World War , the Americans developed a secret and unbreakable code based on the Navajo language . Sgt . Enders together with the promotion , received also an undercover mission of killing Pvt . Yahzee , if necessary , to avoid Japanese to get the cipher . This movie is very predictable . I had the sensation all the times of what would happen on the next scene and even the end of the story . I myself expected much more from Nicolas Cage ( for me , one of the best actors in Hollywood ) , and John Woo ( one of the greatest director of action movies ) . It is not a bad movie , but it is not in the same level of the recent Randall Wallace's ' We Were Soldiers ' , for example . Anyway , it is recommended for viewers that like war and action movies , John Woo and Nicolas Cage .
368958	2488512	282515	7.0	A Typical Example That a Low Budget Movie , Having a Suitable Screenplay in the Hands of Good Director and Cast , Works	Minor SpoilerFranck Chaievski ( Richard Anconina ) and Nina Delgado ( Anne Parillaud , gorgeous as usual ) are two undercover detectives of a French special force trying to identify two corrupt members of the Paris Police Force . Franck is pretending to be a gangster and Nina a prostitute living with him , and involved in a robbery of a fortune in diamonds , having seven deaths and some injured persons . This movie is a typical example that a low budget movie , having a suitable screenplay in the hands of good director and cast , works . The plot is simple , but the way the facts are presented to the viewer through flashback is great . Violent as you may presume a heist and a police interrogatory to criminals are , the fans of police story movies will certainly enjoy this film . Title ( Brazil ) : " Gangsters "
370399	2488512	122291	7.0	Funny " Chanchada "	While grieving her husband in a cemetery , a widow meets a smart widower and tells him that she has inherited a large amount of money from her husband . The small time crook convinces her to go to a beauty shop and he moves to her apartment , going to parties , theaters , restaurants and casinos with her . The widow brings her son Carlinhos ( Oscarito ) , who lives in a mental institution , to live with them . " Tristezas Não Pagam Dívidas " is a funny Brazilian musical comedy called " chanchada " , written and directed by Ruy Costa . This very common type of movie in the 40s has great technical limitations and usually is a silly storyline prepared for many songs sing by the popular Brazilian radio singers of the 40s . The original running time of " Tristezas Não Pagam Dívidas " was about 100 minutes , but only 43 minutes survived , therefore it is quite difficult to understand some parts of the story . Title ( Brazil ) : " Tristezas Não Pagam Dívidas " ( " Sadnesses Do not Pay Debts " )

The British civilian Leonard Markham ( Campbell Scott ) is requested to support an American ? British joint-venture in a secret project leaded by the American Robert Glass ( Anthony Hopkins ) due to his knowledge of electronics . Afterhours , in his spare time , the naive Leonard meets the divorced Maria ( Isabella Rossellini ) in a night-club and they have an affair , falling in love for each other . However , Otto ( Ronald Nitschke ) , the former husband of Maria , threatens and blackmails her , affecting the personal life and the professional performance of Leonard , culminating in a difficult situation for him . " The Innocent " is a surprisingly good love story in times of cold war . While in " Casablanca " the elegant Rick Blaine spontaneously sacrifices his love for Ilsa Lund Laszlo in a noble situation , in " The Innocent " we see a sacrifice of a love provoked by a dirty and nasty situation . However , this movie has action , love , black humor and suspense and is a worthwhile entertainment . Title ( Brazil ) : " O Inocente " ( " The Innocent " )

The objective is to find a flower , Blood Orchid , that flourishes for a couple of weeks every seven years and could be a fountain of youth , prolonging the expectation of life of human beings . They are succeeded and once in Borneo , they realize that it is the raining season and there is no boat available to navigate on the river . They pay US$ 50 , 000 . 00 to convince Captain Bill Johnson ( Johnny Messner ) and his partner Tran ( Karl Yune ) to sail to the location . After an accident in a waterfall , the survivors realize that a pack of anacondas have gathered for mating and their nest is nearby the plantation of Blood Orchid , which made them bigger and bigger . I saw " Anacondas : The Hunt for the Blood Orchid " with a very low expectation based on the IMDb User Rating , but I liked this entertaining adventure a lot . The story is full of action and humor , and I laughed a lot when Cole calls Sam of " Lorena Babbitt " when she cuts the head of one anaconda . There are the usual clichés of this type of predictable B-movie , but I had a good surprise in the end .

" Cinema , Aspirinas e Urubus " is a simple , realistic and pleasant tale of friendship . This road-movie has a story based on the performances of Peter Ketnath and mainly of João Miguel , whose character has some excellent lines , associated to a sharp screenplay and precise direction . I love Brazilian movies , but the indication of this good movie to a nomination to the Oscar seems much exaggerated to me . Title ( Brazil ) : " Cinema , Aspirinas e Urubus " ( " Cinema , Aspirins and Vultures " )

His recollection is triggered by the question of the " sheriff " Isabel , and later with the situation of Juliet . The secret of Achara and the reaction of her brother and friends are quite incomprehensible and exaggerated . In the end , Jack has the same feeling while walking with " The Others " that he had in Phuket , of a complete stranger in a strange land . Title ( Brazil ) : Not Available

This bizarre vegetarian character meets a dysfunctional Ukrainian family that owns an amateurish travel agency specialized in helping Jews to find missing relatives , and together they have an almost surrealistic road-trip through the country of Ukraine . The movie begins like a comedy , with a sarcastic black humor , and ends in a touching and tragic drama recommended for specific audiences .

368781	2488512	373889	7.0	Another Entertaining Adventure	After defending himself and Dudley Dursley with magic from an attack of the Dementors , Harry Potter ( Daniel Radcliffe ) is sent to a hearing and found not guilty from the accusation of inappropriate use of magic in front of humans . Then he returns to Hogwarts and finds that most people do not believe that Voldemort is back . Further , the Ministry of Magic has assigned the annoying and despicable Dolores Umbridge ( Imelda Staunton ) to change the directions in the school affecting the lives of the teachers and mainly the students . She suspends the practical course of self-defense spells , and Harry Potter and his friends Hermione ( Emma Watson ) and Ronnie ( Rupert Grint ) form a clandestine group to learn magic with Harry Potter . Meanwhile Harry Potter has horrible visions and nightmares and Severus Snape ( Alan Rickman ) tells him that he is mentally connected to the Dark Lord , teaching him how to defend from an intrusion in his mind . " Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix " is another entertaining adventure of this young witch and his friends . The top-notch cast , with most of the best British actors and actresses , introduces the stunning Imelda Staunton in the role of a very nasty character and she is amazingly perfect . Contradictorily , the weakest name in these Harry Potter films is the hero and lead actor Daniel Radcliffe , but unfortunately there is no other way to handle the situation . The special effects are state of art and very impressive . My daughter is a big fan of Harry Potter , she reads all his books immediately after the release , and I imagine how difficult is to write an adaptation to the cinema of such number of pages . But for those like me that have not read the book , it works very well . Title ( Brazil ) : " Harry Potter e a Ordem do Fênix " ( " Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix " )

Ahead of time , she shocks the conservative Catholic Brazilian society with her costumes of being naked most of the time , and when she moves to the " Ilha do Sol " , a property of her own , it became a nudism colony . This movie was awarded in Gramado Festival , and Lucélia Santos has an amazing performance , being very natural naked most of the time and dancing with snakes . The story omits many parts of the biography of Luz del Fuego , highlighting her mostly as a low-level woman , and explores the beautiful body of Lucélia Santos . However , in accordance information of the site : http aolliver vilabol uol com br luzdelfuego html ( written in Portuguese ) , Luz del Fuego was born on 21 February 1917 , with the name of Dora Vivacqua , in Cachoeiro do Itapemirim ( ES ) . In 1944 , she began her artistic career with the company of two snakes , " Cornélio e Castorina " , working in " Circo Pavilhão Azul " ( " Blue Flag Circus " ) , with the artistic name of " Luz Divina " . In 1947 , she changed her name to the foreign artistic name of " Luz del Fuego " , following the advice of her friend , the clown " Cascudo " , expecting to attract a greater public . Later , she was hired by the owners of the theater " Follies " . Luz del Fuego was an ecologist and naturalist , in a period when these themes were not discussed by the Brazilian society . In 1950 , she opened the first nudity colony of the Latin American in the Ilha do Sol ( " Island of the Sun " ) , in São Gonçalo . She wrote two books : " Trágico Black Out " ( " Tragic Black-Out " , in 1947 ) and " Verdade Nua " ( " Naked Truth " , in 1950 ) . Part of her profits with these books were donated to charity institution . The famous Ilha do Sol hosted many international vips , such as Errol Flynn , Ava Garden , Tyrone Powel , Brigite Bardot , Steve MacQueen , César Romeno , Laura Turner and Gleen Ford . On 19 July 1967 , Luz del Fuego was murdered by Alfredo Teixeira Dias and Mozart . In 1982 , the pictures of Lucélia Santos in this film was the front page and the centerfold of the Brazilian edition of Playboy magazine . Further , it is worthwhile watching this movie .

Michael , with the support of Jake , Detective Pryce ( Amanda Redman ) and the ghosts , try to avoid the ninth crime and find the serial-killer . I saw " The Sight " on video , and it seems to be a pilot of a series , since the story has a " hook " for a sequel . If this film is a pilot , I would like to know where I can find the series . The story is a kind of supernatural mystery movie in the same line of " Haunted " , " The Others " , " The Sixth Sense " and " El Espinazo del Diablo " , and I really liked it . There are some flaws in the screenplay , like for example when Michael pays a visit to the lawyer in the burned building with his friend Jake , or why the ghosts do not simply tell him who the killer is , but anyway it is an enjoyable entertainment , working perfectly on video or DVD and being a promising TV series .

Renato assumes his guilty , and the young boy Hélio ( Agnaldo Rayol ) , who witnessed the crime , convinces Marta to testify that Renato killed Walter in self-defense . " Somos Todos Irmãos " is a movie made in the beginning of Brazilian cinema's new phase . In the end of the 40's , Brazilian cinema made a rupture with the previous model mainly due to the post-war ; political changes ; growing industrialization ; and new references of the traditions of the Brazilian man and culture . In this movie , both black characters have different views of the society . The story does not fall in the usual melodramatic Hollywoodian clichés and there is no final redemption . This movie was produced by Atlântida but unfortunately the available copy is almost impossible to be heard . I probably understood less than 40 % of the powerful dialogs .

When Ah-Soon calls her Esther Santos and she finds some belongings of the unknown Esther in the house , she discloses a dark and scary secret about the past of her masters . " The Maid " is an original , scary and very-well constructed ghost story based on a Chinese superstition . The screenplay introduces with an explanation about the seventh month of the lunar calendar , and Mrs . Teo explains the rules to be accomplished to Rosa , giving the big picture about the theme to the viewers like me that are not familiarized with this tradition . I startled many times with the creepy ghosts , and the scene when Rosa is watching the presentation of the troupe sat in the middle of the spirits is really frightening .

However , he spends all the money he makes in his addiction , parties with clients and friends and travels , never structuring or organizing a network or saving money . When he is arrested , he is sent to the prison first and later to the judicial asylum for treatment , reintegrating to the society . Presently João is a successful musical producer . " Meu Nome Não É Johnny " depicts the raise and redemption of a drug-dealer in the most positive story I have recently seen . The dynamic narrative discloses the true story in a wonderful combination of drama and comedy , with the excellent Selton Mello in the lead role . The dialogs are intelligent , the corruption of police is slightly disclosed but the screenplay never goes deeper in the connections of João Guilherme ? who are the suppliers or the users , for example , are totally forgotten . Have they helped Johnny later ? In the prison , the relationship of João Guilherme and the criminals are also not very clear . However , the objective of the movie is achieved and I personally loved the message of the possibility of recovering of a doomed person .

Ma Shan drank too much in the party and does not recall what might have happen with his weapon . He falls in disgrace with his superiors and investigates who might have stolen the gun . When his former sweetheart Li Xiaomeng ( Jing Ning ) is found dead with a shot of his weapon , he becomes the prime suspect . When the police force arrests his acquaintance Zhou Xiaogang ( Shi Liang ) , he discloses that Li Xiaomeng was accidentally killed since his friend was the real target of the murderer . Ma Shan uses Zhou Xiaogang as a bait to lure and arrest the criminal an retrieve his missing gun . " The Missing Gun " was one of the greatest and best surprises among the movies I have recently watched . China Video usually produces low budget , violent and full of action movies with messed screenplays , but " The Missing Gun " is actually a refreshing story that exposes a shock of cultures . In most of Western movies , it is very easy to get a gun ( banal in North American movies ) , but in Communist China , guns are prohibited for the population and therefore they are a symbol of power , respect and honor to the policeman . Even the number of bullets are limited in accordance with this film . Based on this explanation , we can understand the saga of Ma Shan to find his missing gun . This movie has great interpretations , wonderful locations and a beautiful cinematography . The bicycles chase is surrealistic and unusual and one of the most attractive scenes along this great film . The ambiguous conclusion , with the death of Ma Shan , ends this highly recommended movie with golden key . Title ( Brazil ) : " A Arma Perdida " ( " The Lost Weapon " )
369082	2488512	35432	8.0	Great Classic	Phillip Raven ( Alan Ladd ) is a hit-man hired by Willard Gates ( Laird Cregar ) to execute the blackmailer Albert Baker ( Frank Ferguson ) and retrieve a letter and some documents for his unknown boss . When the work is done , Raven is double-crossed by Gates , receiving marked ten dollar bills . Gates delivers the list with the serial number of the bills to the police , expecting they find and kill Raven . Meanwhile , the performer Ellen Graham ( Veronika Lake ) , who is the fiancée of the L . A Detective Lieutenant Michael Crane ( Robert Preston ) , is contacted by Senator Burnett ( Roger Imhof ) and asked to help investigating Gates . She accepts the invitation , and is hired by Gates to work in his private club in Los Angeles . The police force , leaded by Det . Crane , chases Raven for the death of Baker ; Raven chases Gates and his unknown boss , expecting to kill them for their betrayal ; Ellen secretly chases Gates for the government . This is the beginning of a great classic . Alan Ladd and Veronica Lake have fantastic performances in this movie . Alan Ladd is magnificent in the role of a cold blood killer , needy of a friend , that loves cats . In order to show the personality of his character , there is a scene in the beginning of the story , where he almost shoots a crippled girl to eliminate any possible witness of his murder . Veronika Lake is wonderful and very gorgeous , inclusive singing two songs . I disagree with the reference of film-noir for " This Gun For Hire " , since there is no " femme-fatale " , no dirty cop , no weak man ( other than Gates ) or sordid motivation . Indeed it is a police story , showing a cold-blood hit-man without compassion , capable of killing without showing any emotion , hunting " worse guys " looking for his personal vengeance .

Meanwhile , Lana Lang and Whitney Fordman decide to give a break in their relationship , and Clark gets close to Lana , but when he finds the motives for the attitude of Whitney , he approaches Lana to Whitney again . " Shimmer " is another good episode of " Smallville " . In this episode , the beginning of a romance between Clark Kent and Lana Lang certainly is the greatest attraction . The business advices of Lionel Luther ( " Empires are not brought down by outside forces - they are destroyed by weaknesses from within . " ) , some of them based on the " Art of War " , are always very interesting . Title ( Brazil ) : " O Mistério " ( " The Mystery " )

Professor Willoebrook insists that Clark Kent is Namam , the man who fell from the stars , and in accordance with the Indian prophecy , that knife belongs to him and could be destroyed only by his greatest enemy . Meanwhile , Lana Lang decides to move to Paris . " Talisman " is a reasonable episode of Smallville . The story is based on the Indian prophecy , and the greatest enemy of Namam is shown in the very end . The always undecided Lana Lang seems to have finally decided to move to Paris . Amen , since I hate this character . Pete Ross finds that his parents are divorcing and becomes very upset . Title ( Brazil ) : " Talismã " ( " Talisman " )
371859	2488512	404032	8.0	Science vs . Religion	The nineteen years old Catholic college girl Emily Rose ( Jennifer Carpenter ) dies a couple of days after being submitted to an exorcism carried out by her parish priest , Father Moore ( Tom Wilkinson ) . Emily believed she was possessed by six demons , and although authorized by Emily and he parents , Father Moore is accused of negligent homicide , since he had suggested Emily to interrupt the use of medications for epilepsy . In order to avoid a scandal , the Archdiocese hires the successful , ambitious and agnostic lawyer Erin Bruner ( Laura Linney ) , and the prosecution assigns the religious prosecutor Ethan Thomas ( Campbell Scott ) . Along the days , there is a battle between science and religion in the court . " The Exorcism of Emily Rose " was a great surprise for me . Based on a true event , I was expecting a horror movie like " The Exorcist " , but actually it is a great story of trial , with the confrontation of science and religion , but with an agnostic lawyer defending and a religious one accusing a priest . The story is leaded by Erin , and her contact with the unknown and her final speech are some of the great moments of this film . Among the scariest parts are Dr . Cartwright ( Duncan Fraser ) saying that he started praying again since he had witnessed the exorcism , and when the priest explains that 3 AM is the demoniac witching hour . The direction of Scott Derrickson is excellent , using special effects only when necessary , and very well supported by a magnificent cast , leaded by the wonderful Laura Linney and the great Tom Wilkinson , followed by the unknown Jennifer Carpenter , who is great in the role of Emily Rose , Campbell Scott and Colm Feore .

371055	2488512	201416	8.0	A Melodrama in Rio de Janeiro With Influence of the Italian Neo-Realism	The simple and naive country girl Mariana ( Fada Santoro ) arrives in Rio de Janeiro from Minas Gerais trying to find her fiancé , José da Silva ( Hélio Souto ) , with his picture only , and without his phone number or address . She is lodged and welcomed by her simple lower middle class relatives , and sooner they are informed that Mariana is pregnant . The family decides to help her to find José da Silva : her aunt , the kind hearted housewife D . Gisa ( Sara Nobre ) : her cousins , the bus driver Baiano ( Jackson de Souza ) and the aspirant radio singer Elisa ( Dóris Monteiro ) ; the family's friend , the street-car driver Eduardo ; and their neighbor composer , all of them join Mariana in her almost impossible quest , equivalent to find a needle in a haystack . When the shy Eduardo and the simple Mariana fall in love for each other , José da Silva is finally found . But the winding road of love keeps them together . " Agulha no Palheiro " is a good melodrama , with a narrative different from the traditional Brazilian " chanchadas " of that period . The director Alex Viany was originally influenced by the German cinema , mostly by the German Expressionism through the Communist Party , and in this particular film he was very influenced by the Italian Neo-Realism . This movie uses professional actors and actresses and also non-actors or actresses , like , for example , Dória Monteiro , who has an amazing and very natural performance in the role of Elisa . There is a preoccupation of integrating the insertion of the musical presentations with the story , on the contrary of the traditional " chanchadas " , where any situation was a motive for a musical presentation . Further , this movie uses many locations , and shows where the places are physically located , presenting the big picture . Maybe the romance of Mariana and Eduardo is dated in 2006 , but anyway this movie is still better than most of the present romantic-comedies of Hollywood and much related to our culture . Title ( Brazil ) : " Agulha no Palheiro " ( " Needle in a Haystack " )
369665	2488512	374345	8.0	In the Swamp of Corruption and Children Prostitution	I bought this DVD without any reference , and for my surprise it is an excellent thriller . The theme about children prostitution is very well exposed , the beginning of the movie is very impressive , and the actress Lauren Van de Broeck that plays Bieke Cuypers really looks like a little Lolita . The story of an old hit man that has a code of honor and does not accept the job of killing a teenager , turning against the powerful men that hired him , is magnificently disclosed , in a right pace and with stunning performances . The emphatic character of Angelo Ledda is played by the unknown actor Jan Decleir , and I was really impressed with his acting . I have just seen in IMDb that " De Zaak Alzheimer " won seven prizes and three nominations in European Festivals and this movie certainly deserved these awards . The character of Baron Gustave De Haeck , living in a swamp of corruption and children prostitution , would certainly not adapt living in the jungle , as mentioned in the story .

They do not communicate to each other anymore , and Alex is almost speechless at home and without motivation and inspiration in his work as a former successful photographer . When Claire decides to leave him to live with her sculptor teacher , and Alex , completely wasted , accidentally orders an expensive and desirable sex molded doll called " Monique " , his life changes completely . Alex falls in love with Monique , making all his fantasies come true , while his privacy is respected . His behavior affects the lives of his closest friends and Claire . This witty and original comedy plays with endured and routine relationships that are completely exhausted , without communication or sex life . Alex represents those men in middle-age crisis that keep their boring and tedious marriage without any further emotions or dialog , actually accommodated to the situation . Claire represents those women afraid to give a step ahead in life , balancing between a stable finished relationship and the fear for new feelings and experiences . Monique represents the new , the refreshment of a wasted life and the dream of most " Alexs " . The director Valérie Guignabodet shows a great sensibility , approaching this delicate theme in a funny and neutral way , never being corny or accusing or defending who is right or who is wrong in this battle of sexes . One correction : The Worldcup of 1950 was in Brazil , director Valérie Guignabodet committed a serious research mistake . Title ( Brazil ) : " Monique ? Sempre Feliz " ( " Monique ? Always Happy " )

The depressed Amador ( Celso Bugallo ) misses his wife , who left him some time ago . For all of them , each jobless idle day looks like a Sunday . " Los Lunes al Sol " is a bitter and sad worldwide contemporary story , with magnificent performances . I am marine engineer and Rio de Janeiro is the greatest Brazilian pole of naval construction . In the 80's and 90's , I saw many people of this sector , including friends and colleagues , losing their jobs and many of them changing their professions with the crisis in this sector . This type of situation happened in many other economical sectors , and Brazil has presently about a ten percent unemployment rate . I feel very sorrow for those who lost their jobs , and the large number of street vendors and slums in my hometown , associated to very low wages , reflect our present situation . The universe of Santa and his friends may be extended too to many other countries and sectors of the economy , therefore it is very easy to sympathize and understand the drama of the characters . This impressive film is also very well directed and watching it is a worthwhile experience , mainly for the younger generations . Title ( Brazil ) : " Segunda-Feira ao Sol " ( " Monday in the Sun " )
368768	2488512	421239	8.0	Excellent Thriller	After attending the funeral of her grandmother in Dallas , the Lux Atlantic Hotel manager Lisa ( Rachel McAdams ) is waiting for a flight to Miami . Due to the bad weather and consequent flight delay , she meets in the airport bar Jack Rippner ( Cillian Murphy ) , who is also in the waiting list . They sit together in the plane , and Jack reveals that he wants Lisa to change the room in Lux of an important American politician to facilitate a terrorist attempt against him . Otherwise , Lisa's father will be killed by a hit man . Lisa has to decide what to do with the menacing man at her side . " Red Eye " is one of the best thrillers I have recently seen . The claustrophobic first part of this movie is amazing , with a great performances of Rachel McAdams in the strong role of a heroine and the weird Cillian Murphy as a cold and cruel villain . Unfortunately , Wes Craven in the second half , after the plot point with the landing of the plane , uses the usual clichés and flaws of thrillers and the film loses its strong initial impact . Nevertheless , " Red Eye " is still an excellent thriller and a great entertainment for a Saturday evening . Title Brazil ) : " Vôo Noturno " ( " Night Flight " )
370855	2488512	702943	8.0	Martha Kent , the Heroine	Three months later the last episode , Lois Lane ( Erica Durance ) , the cousin of Chloe Sullivan , drives to Smallville trying to find Clark Kent to help her to find the responsible for Chloe's murder .

She brings him to Smallville Medical Center , where Martha is with Jonathan Kent , who is in a hopeless coma . Martha brings Clark back to the farm , expecting him to retrieve his memory . Meanwhile , Lana Lang has an American boyfriend in Paris , Jason Teague ( Jensen Ackles ) , and is having good time with him . Lex Luthor's blood is poisoned and he travels to bring an ancient object retrieved from an excavation . The first episode of the Fourth Season shows news characters ( Lois Lane , Jason Teague and Bridgette Crosby ) and situations . I loved to see Margot Kidder again , the unforgettable Lois Lane of " Superman " . Pete Ross left the show , and we do not know what has happened with Chloe . The effect of the black kryptonite is very different and in this episode , the greatest heroine is to Martha Kent , who saves her son and her husband . Title ( Brazil ) : " Cruzada " ( " Crusade " )
371603	2488512	539462	8.0	True Love Conquers All	A couple of days before the wedding of Elliot Spencer and Allison Michaels , his mother Mrs . Grace Spencer is unexpectedly visited by her old acquaintance Hannah Webster and Jade D'Mon , who put a spell on Elliot to marry Jade , actually the demon Hecate , with the intention to get pregnant and have an offspring . Piper is hired to cater the wedding , while Phoebe has a premonition of the birth of a demon baby . When a priest is murdered in the mansion with an ancient dagger , Prue discloses the mystery and together with her sisters , they decide to help Allison and destroy the demon . " The Wedding from Hell " is a good episode with a weak conclusion , since nobody including Andy question what happened with the ceremony and mostly with Jade . Anyway , the situations with the nice trio of lead actresses make this show worthwhile . Title ( Brazil ) : " Um Casamento dos Infernos " ( " A Wedding from Hells " )
372132	2488512	979595	9.0	Moments of Truth , In the Most Intriguing Conclusion of " Lost "	Juliet invites Sun along the night to submit to a medical ultrasonography examination in a facility of The Others hidden in the hatch to determine the date of conception of the fetus . Juliet discloses that the women that became pregnant in the island had died , driving Sun to a dilemma about who could be the father of the baby . Meanwhile she recalls when she was blackmailed by a stranger about the origins of Jin . Desmond , Charles , Jin and Hurley capture Mikhail and he makes an offer : he could heal the wounded woman if they release him after the conclusion of the medical procedures . The last minute of " D . O . C . " is certainly the most intriguing conclusion of " Lost " , when Naomi tells the fate of the Oceanic Airlines Flight 815 . There are many moments of truth in this episode centered in Sun , like when she finds who the father of her baby is or the secret about Jin's mother . The evil Juliet may hate Ben , but I believe I hate this despicable woman most . Unfortunately Sayid is not in the group leaded by Desmond to " take care " of Mikhail ; I believe Desmond will regret his decision . Further , in my opinion every viewer and fan of " Lost " is anxiously expecting the next episode . Title ( Brazil ) : Not Available

She is fired and with a total lack of perspective of finding a new job , she decides to accept the offer to work as a drug mule , flying to USA with approx . seventy pellets of cocaine in her stomach . Once in New York , things do not happen as planned . " Maria Full of Grace " is a very powerful and real movie about the lack of perspective in the life of teenagers in poor countries . The dramatic story takes place in Colombia and is based on real events , the use of poor people to transport drugs to United States of America . Once there , the poor adolescent sees a chance to join to the American Dream and give a better life to her unborn child and make money to send to her family . In my country , mules are not the problem , but the use of children , protected by law , by the dealers in the traffic of drugs . The story is very well written , and the movie has a stunning direction . Catalina Sandino Moreno has awesome performance and this film really deserves the nomination for Oscar and another twenty-seven ( 27 ) wins and twenty-one ( 21 ) nominations in Festivals . The title plays with the Catholic prayer " Ave Maria " . Title ( Brazil : " Maria Cheia de Graça " ( " Maria Full of Grace " )
372091	2488512	77878	9.0	Police and Bandit Are All the Same Stuff	Lúcio Flávio Lírio was a famous bank-robber in the early seventies in Rio de Janeiro , glamorized by part of the population and press due to his bold robberies and escapes . " Lúcio Flávio , o Passageiro da Agonia " is a spectacular and brave film of Hecto Babenco , which shows themes like " Death Squad " and the corruption in the police of Rio de Janeiro . The viewer shall understand that these subjects where hidden from the Brazilian society in those times of military dictatorship , but Lucio Flávio disclosed names and how the system operated before being killed in the penitentiary on 29 January 1975 . José Louzeiro wrote a book with his revelations and Hector Babenco made this daring movie . Even in 2005 , this film is very attractive : the performances of the cast are outstanding , and Reginaldo Farias is superb in the role of the famous outlaw . The dialogs are amazing , and I have selected my three favorite lines for the readers ( Obs : it is a free translation , since the movie is spoken in Portuguese ) : ( 1 ) Moretti to Lúcio Flavio : " - Heads and tails are in different sides of the coin , but very close to each other . Police and bandit are all the same stuff , both of them are in the same boat . " ( 2 ) Lúcio Flávio : " - I have been " dead meat " for a long time . I am just waiting time to come . " ( 3 ) Lúcio Flávio : " - Jail without money does not work . " " Lúcio Flávio , o Passageiro da Agonia " was awarded with the 1978 Golden Kikito in the following categories : Best Actor ( Reginaldo Farias ) , Best Cinematography , Best Editing and Best Supporting Actor ( Ivan Cândido ) . Unfortunately , it seems that this is another excellent Brazilian movie without international distribution . Even in Brazil , I have a very old VHS , bought from a rental , and this movie has not been released on DVD . IMDb users , lovers of films like the dear Bob the Moo , will probably not have the chance to see this excellent film . Title ( Brazil ) : " Lúcio Flávio , o Passageiro da Agonia " ( " Lúcio Flávio , the Passenger of the Agony " )
372401	2488512	373283	9.0	Powerful Humanistic War Movie	After surviving a massacre in Malmedy , a location behind the German army in Europe , four American soldiers with only one weapon rescue the British pilot Oberon Winley ( Kirby Heyborn ) in a tree and they move together , trying to reach the allied forces and save a great number of allied soldiers from a German attack with the information got by Winley in his flight . While marching , each soldier discloses inner secrets to the rest of the group . What a great movie this " Saints and Soldiers " is ! Awarded with many prizes in minor festivals , and recommended by some friends of mine , I saw it yesterday and I was really surprised with a powerful humanistic war story . I do not know how precise it is , but the screenplay was based on true events as per the information in the beginning of the film . The performances are very human and real , touching in some moments , and presented in a very suitable pace . This team of unknown actors and director really made an excellent war movie , and I really would like to record my congratulation to all of them . Title ( Brazil ) : " Santos ou Soldados " ( " Saints or Soldiers " )
369666	2488512	390808	9.0	Powerful Movie ? Probably the Best Police Story that I Have Recently Seen	A couple of days ago I saw the trailer of " 36 Quai des Orfèvres " and I decided to buy the DVD . What a powerful movie it is , probably the best police story that I have recently seen . The dramatic and amoral story is a contemporary film-noir , with action , betrayal , shootings and hooks the attention from the beginning to the end . There is a great duel between two titans : Gérard Depardieu , in the role of a scum detective , and Daniel Auteuil , playing a detective with non-conventional procedures , and they both deserved nomination to the Oscar for such brilliant performances . The music score , with the song " Don't Bring me Down " , is also wonderful . The grandiosity of " 36 Quai des Orfèvres " recalled me 1995 " Heat " , one of the best police stories of the 90's . I really do not understand why there are negative reviews for such great film . Title ( Brazil ) : " 36 "

Later , he meets Kate ( the beautiful Nancy Travis ) , a broker , who helps him to find a new house . Lieberman will fall in love with Kate , and many funny and cynical situations will happen . This short story is a masterpiece of the cynicism : great , outstanding , very funny . Congratulation to the writer , the screenwriter , the director Christine Lahti , cast and crew . I really love it !

The situations generated by this lie are delicious . This is indeed a lovely movie . With humor , innocence , great screenplay and direction and outstanding performances of Claude Rich and Salomé Stévenin , it is a type of movie to be watched by the whole family . This film is not well known in Brazil : looks like a hidden jewel to be discovered by viewers who appreciate a sensible story with wonderful performances and direction . Roberto Benigni , with his Oscar winner ' Life is Beautiful ' , copied not only the screenplay of the fantastic ' Train de Vie ' , but also the innocence of this marvelous ' Les Jardin des Plantes ' .
370488	2488512	381681	9.0	Delightful Sequel of One of the Most Beautiful Romances I Have Ever Seen	In Paris , the American writer Jesse Howard ( Ethan Hawk ) is in the end of an European tour , promoting his novel about the one night stand he had with a young French woman nine years ago .

Along the moments together , they realize that they are still in love for each other . " Before Sunset " is a delightful sequel of " Before Sunrise " , which is in my opinion one of the most beautiful romances I have ever seen . The screenplay was written by Ethan Hawk , Julie Delpy and Richard Linklater and it is fantastic , with wonderful dialogs . It is also amazing the natural performances of Ethan Hawk and Julie Delpy , who intensively live the characters of Jesse and Celine . It is impossible not liking this movie ! The simple song sang by Julie Delpy is a great complement to this lovely fairy tale . Title ( Brazil ) : " Antes do Pôr-do-Sol " ( " Before Sunset " )

Chloe publishes the picture in the front page of The Torch , and Clark receives an e ? mail from a wealthy and prominent scientist from New York . He schedules a meeting with Dr . Virgil Swann ( Christopher Reeve ) and learns about his origins in Krypton . The greatest attraction is this episode certainly is the participation of the former Superman Christopher Reeve disclosing to Kal-El his origins . The story is basically centered in Clark seeking the truth about his origins , and being partially satisfied with the answers . Title ( Brazil ) : " Respostas " ( " Answers " )

Later , Clark Kent goes with Chloe Sullivan to the cave , and she is also pierced , changing immediately her behavior . When Pete puts a red kryptonite in the pocket of Clark , the trio makes lots of mess in Smallville and hurts the feelings of Lana . " Rush " is another great episode of Smallville . In this episode , Clark Kent finally invites Lana Lang to date , but the reason for the failure of the scheduled date is not compatible with the situation and problems of Pete and Chloe . Lana is not reasonable with her attitude . Title ( Brazil ) : " Pura Adrenalina " ( " Pure Adrenaline " )
371553	2488512	702984	9.0	Investigating the Past and Disclosing Hidden Secrets	When Lana Lang is hit by a blow of a gas pipeline in the field , she has visions of a criminal and sees Chloe Sullivan being kidnapped . Meanwhile , Lex Luthor is visited by the despicable reporter Roger Nixon ( Tom O'Brien ) that convinces him to open again the investigation of the mysterious events surrounding the meteor shower of years ago . " Obscura " presents two different stories at the same time : the one about the power achieved by Lana Lang in her accident , but the most important is the one about the achievement of a piece of Clark Kent's spacecraft by Dr . Steven Hamilton ( Joe Morton ) in the fields and the investigation of Roger Nixon . I believe the series will take another route along the next episodes . Title ( Brazil ) : " Oculto " ( " Hidden " )

During her assignment , Rachel recognizes Günther Franken ( Waldemar Kobus ) as the commander of the attack to the boat of refugees and later she discovers that the murders are part of a scheme with a traitor in the resistance team . " Zwartboek " is a spectacular epic , with an impressive theme that joins drama , romance , action , betrayals and thriller in times of war in a story full of twists . Paul Verhoeven has another awesome work not only as director , but also as writer together with Gerard Soeteman . The locations , cinematography and art decoration are amazing , with a magnificent reconstruction of the landscapes of Netherlands in the end of World War II . The performances are top-notch , and the actress Carice van Houten is wonderful , giving a unique acting . I regret only that this skilled actress is absolutely unknown in Brazil , and I really expect to have a chance to see her again on the screen . I only do not understand why this outstanding movie has no nominations to the Oscar . Title ( Brazil ) : " A Espiã " ( " The Spy " )
369988	2488512	166851	9.0	Three Amoral Tales of One of the Best Brazilian Writers	' Betrayal ' is an adaptation to the screen of three amoral tales of Nelson Rodrigues , one of the best Brazilian contemporaneous writers . 1st Episode : ' O Primeiro Pecado ' ( ' The First Sin ' ) Director : Arthur Fontes ( 02 Nov 2004 ) Mário ( Pedro Cardoso ) meets the married woman Irene ( Fernanda Torres ) in the bus station , and a few days later , he invites her to go to the apartment of his friend Jordão ( Tonico Pereira ) for having sex . Revelations and lies are disclosed in the end . 2nd Episode : ' Diabólica ' ( ' Evil Woman ' ) Director : Claudio Torres ( 02 Nov 2004 ) On the rainy day of his wedding with Dagmar ( Fernanda Torres ) , Geraldo ( Daniel Dantas ) goes to a precinct with the dead body of his bride's sister Alicinha ( Ludmila Dayer ) . While waiting for the family , Geraldo tells Marshal Argemiro Santos ( Francisco Cuoco ) a sordid and sick story . Further dirty revelations are disclosed in the end . 3rd Episode : ' Cachorro ! ' ( ' Dog ! ' , literally , but meaning ' Bastard ! ' ) Director : José Henrique Fonseca ( 02 Nov 2004 ) A husband ( Alexandre Borges ) goes to a cheap hotel room , where he finds his best friend ( José Henrique Fonseca ) having sex with his wife ( Drica Moraes ) . The story has a tragic end . I am a great fan of Nelson Rodrigues and I used to read his column on the newspaper ( although many of his texts were about his soccer team ' Fluminense ' , and mine is his opponent ' Flamengo ' ) and some of his books . Many screenplays in the Brazilian cinema or TV series or theater plays are adaptation of his stories . His corrupted and amoral view of the values of the society and religion has always fascinated me . ' Betrayal ' is performed by some of the best Brazilian actors and actresses , leaded by Fernanda Montenegro and Fernanda Torres . My global vote is nine . Title ( Brazil ) : ' Traição ' ( ' Betrayal ' )
368992	2488512	319758	9.0	The Karma of a Wealthy Country , In an Engaging Movie	In 1990 , the producer Robert Wiener ( Michael Keaton ) convinces the direction of CNN to go to Iraq with his crew due to the increasing tension of this country with USA . When Baghdad was bombed and Iraq invaded in 1991 , CNN was the unique television broadcasting the events , being worldwide projected as a great news channel . I liked very much ' Live From Baghdad ' , mainly because the story is very decent and engaging and stays politically neutral , trying not to manipulate the viewer with any political crap , and limiting to show the hard work and difficulties of the CNN team to work in country under the pressure of an eminent war and with a totally different culture . The direction and the performance of the cast are excellent , but Michael Keaton , Helena Bonham Carter and David Suchet ( whose name I have not found in the IMDb credits ) are superb . The original title of my review was ' A Decent Movie ' , and for my surprise there is another review with this title . Once there is a very interesting line about the karma of a country with oil fields , which would be a cemetery of forest and dinosaurs , I decided to highlight this uncommon reference . Title ( Brazil ) : ' Ao Vivo de Bagdá ' ( ' Live From Baghdad ' )
369265	2488512	167261	10.0	A Sequel in the Same Level as the Original Movie	This sequel of the best movie of fantasy and adventure ever made can not be seen as another movie , but the second part of a splendid film . The journey of Frodo Baggins and his friends in this movie is also outstanding , stunning , a masterpiece . I believe there is nothing else to be said about this fantastic movie .
369616	2488512	70644	10.0	Another Ingmar Bergman's Masterpiece	The lawyer Marianne ( Liv Ullmann ) and the professor Johan ( Erland Josephson ) have been married for ten years , having two daughters . One night , Johan tells Marianne that he met a young woman , Paula , and he will travel to Paris with her for eight months . Caught by surprise , the perfect world of Marianne falls apart , and she starts living alone . Along the next ten years , they meet each other in different situations , in a relation of love and hate for each other . The first time I watched this theatrical movie I was single and was less than twenty years old . In that occasion , I loved the performances of Liv Ullmann and Erland Josephson , but I found the story too long . Today , with twenty-five years of marriage , I have watched this film again on video : what a masterpiece ! Ingmar Begman presents an amazingly credible and honest story of the relationship of a couple along twenty years of their lives . Liv Ullmann is so beautiful and has such a stunning performance that impressed me . Erland Josephson also has a magnificent performance as an insecure but sensitive man , full of contradictions and without knowing how to make a decision about his feelings . Unfortunately the VHS spoken in Swedish distributed by Concorde in Brazil has many dialogs without subtitles . Sometimes , four , five sentences are omitted in the translation , or a long speech of a character is resumed to a five or six words sentence . A crime against the viewer ! Highly recommended for married couples as a lesson of life . Title ( Brazil ) : ' Cenas de um Casamento ' ( ' Scenes From a Marriage ' )

" Cogenitor " is original , dramatic and tragic , and certainly the best episode of the Second Season up to now . The story is important to show that there are different cultures where the concepts of what seems to be right or wrong are different from the standards of others and must be respected , no matter in deep space or on Earth . In Brazil we have a saying that could be translated as follows : " the hell is full of people with good intentions " . Trip seems to have learned the lesson through the most difficult way when he sees the consequences of his action . Title ( Brazil ) : " Cogenitor "

A deranged and wounded Jason goes to the Kent farm and threatens Martha and Jonathan trying to find the stones . And Chloe saves Clark in the Luthor mansion . " Commencement " is certainly the best episode of the Fourth Season of " Smallville " , with many new situations : the death of Genevieve Teague ; the declaration of Lana to Clark ; another meteor shower in Smallville ; Chloe secretly saving Clark ; Lana apparently seeing a spacecraft ; Clark sent to the Artic . Unfortunately I have to wait for the release of the Fifth Season on DVD to watch the sequel of this excellent episode . Title ( Brazil ) : " Formatura " ( " Graduation " )
