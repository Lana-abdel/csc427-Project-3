420968	2542703	147612	1.0	Happiness is Anything But . . .	This is a real clinker of a movie . It is certainly not for the squeamish among us . This story of a dysfunctional family puts the word dysfunctional over the top in most dictionaries . We don't have to be reminded that a psychiatrist could be a child molester and that Camryn Manheim , who really throws her weight around on screen , could have killed a doorman and chopped his body into pieces . There is one solid performance and that belongs to Jane Adams as the youngest sister who appears to be the biggest loser of them all . Unlucky in forming solid relationships , she falls for a Russian cab driver who is out to get her money . As she did in her Oscar nominated supporting performance in " Junebug , " Miss Adams pulls out all the emotional stops here as well . She will be the next Joanne Woodward as she matures in films . She evokes plenty of frustration and emotional turbulence in her roles . It's just the poor quality of this film that does her in .
421420	2542703	427392	1.0	This " Invasion " Needs to Be Conquered	Who wrote this junk ? Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig star in this mysterious trash dealing with a virus that comes to earth and causes people to be almost monster-like . They become like zombies and then resort to violence to get others to join them . At first there is a nuclear disaster which brings about the epidemic . You come down with the disease by falling asleep and it manifests itself during the rem dreaming period . I would suggest that you risk the virus and fall asleep on this miserable film . The writing is a complete joke . New York is quarantined and Kidman's son and ex-husband run to Baltimore to stay with his mother . The latter looks just like the type you would meet in Borough Park , Brooklyn . Of course , Kidman is in pursuit and she naturally gets into a pharmacy and has a serum from keeping her from sleeping . What hogwash .
421502	2542703	28358	1.0	Things to Come-If this Be True , Stop the World I Want to Get Off	Dreadful film of things to come . I still have nightmares after viewing this master mess of a film . True , the story tells us of the devastation of war and its aftermath . True , the sets are good and appropriate for what the film is trying to show . However , the writing is very bad and the acting even worse . As the boss , Sir Ralph Richardson gives one of the worst performances on record . It is almost laughable when in reality it is so tragic . As the hero , Raymond Massey is impressive but he is given such poor material to work with . The acting by others is extremely stilted . Cedric Hardwicke as the man against progress is another joke . I thought he was trying to act like a pharaoh-like character as he did 20 years later in " The Ten Commandments . " That's a movie , not this piece of trash . While the set decorations were good , is that what Welles thought the world would look like in the 1970s ? Who was that woman who played Richardson's wife ? She came off as an Amazon , reminding me of Phaedre . Her performance was truly wretched , but so is the rest of the film .
420565	2542703	400525	1.0	Ice Harvest It's Not Even for the ( Snow ) Birds !	Ridiculous nonsense involving an attorney ( John Cusack ) and his pal ( Billy Bob Thornton ) who steal $2 . 1 million from the mob in Kansas City . Robert Benton , the screenwriter for this nonsense , never bothers to explain to us how they were able to pull this caper off . Perhaps , that might have made for better entertainment . Instead , this misery of a film becomes a shooting and stabbing film . The scene at the river is just gruesome enough . Cusack thinks that Billy Bob is dead . He isn't but the latter's wife is thanks to Thornton putting a bullet in back of her head . Thornton tells Cusack that the mobster did it but as the latter is felled by a bullet , he blurts out that Billy Bob killed his own wife . Then there is a girlfriend who helps Cusack kill the other mobster , a disgusting looking Randy Quaid . If this is called black comedy , please bring in the light of day . Simply awful .
420820	2542703	365485	1.0	This Matador is Full of Bull	Absolutely terrible film dealing with a burned out assassin ( Julian ) , played by a hard drinking , heavy smoking Pierce Brosnan and his chance meeting with a conventional business person Danny ( Greg Kinnear ) The two become friends as Julian tells Danny that he is burned out . He can get out of this deal by doing one more job-the job we find out is killing his boss ! The gags are ridiculous . This is a very amateurish , inane comedy . Kinnear tells Julian that his son was killed in a school bus accident . Julian changes the subject and that ticks off Danny . The viewers should be ticked off with the rest of this foolishness as well .
421466	2542703	37420	1.0	I Was Up in Arms After Seeing this Picture	A colossal Danny Kaye bomb . It's amazing that Danny's film career went anywhere after a film as miserable as this . This was not the film to showcase his talents . Dana Andrews was not for musicals . It was as simple as that . He played his sidekick in this and was Jeanne Crain's love interest in " State Fair . " Andrews hit his stride in " The Best Years of Our Lives . " Danny is a severe hypochondriac in this film . He gets drafted and loves Constance Dowling who doesn't have the heart to tell him that it's Andrews who is her love interest . Dinah Shore , as Virginia , loves Danny but he can't see it . General mayhem develops when all 4 of the characters are on the ship and Dowling becomes a castaway by accident . Look for Margaret Dumont in 2 brief scenes . I guess she was taking a respite from the Marx Brothers . She is not even at her gawky best here . Also miscast are Louie Calhern and Lyle Talbot , both wonderful character actors , who have little to do here and are wasted . Dinah sings nicely and I guess that she and Kaye make a nice Jewish couple . That's about it .
421393	2542703	496806	1.0	Ocean's 13 - Drown It	Even an all-star cast can't save this misery of a movie . Danny Ocean is back with his pack ready for another caper . The original Ocean's 11 was lousy and believe me , this one is no better . I love Al Pacino's flaming red hair . At the beginning , I actually thought that Pacino's character would rival that in the wonderful Dick Tracy film . That role got him a supporting Oscar nomination . This picture he'd go absolutely nowhere . How about a little more excitement here such as terrorizing Elliott Gould ? Carl Reiner looked like he was ready to attend a Brighton Beach outing in this film . Bernie Mac at the gambling table ? He looked more like a super fool here . Ellen Barkin was just ridiculous in her role as Mr . Bank's ( Pacino's ) subordinate . By the way , what's going on here ? Are our motley crew more interested in breaking the bank or getting that piece of jewelry . Even the alleged earthquake scene was dull . Old ladies in a nursing home could run out faster in their wheelchairs . A thoroughly ridiculous , poorly written film . Scrap it to the garbage dump .
420913	2542703	206634	1.0	Below For This Awful Movie	If this is what movie making has come to , count me out . This is one of the worst pictures ever made . It's even worse that 200l : A Space Odyssey , 5 Card Stud , etc . What a stupid plot ! Women are no longer pregnant . What would the church say about this ? This isn't even about abortion . The very talented Clive Owen is in this mess and I extend his greatest sympathy to him . What's going on in 2027 ? The world has certainly lost its way in this monumental mess . Who is the father of this girl ? What's going on here ? How fortunate that Julianne Moore and veteran Michael Caine take bullets to finish them off . What is the message that the author is trying to convey here ? The streets are beyond bombed out . Who is the enemy here ? Who are the terrorists ? I was hoping that Woody Allen would pop out and restore some sense into this nonsense .
421237	2542703	94663	1.0	Another Woman , Another Stinker	Marion is the head of the Philosophy Department at a college who takes a leave of absence to write a book . As far as I'm concerned , she ( Gena Rowlands ) should have taken a leave from this terrible film . Marion , as in the case with too many of Woody's characters , has emotional hangups . Writing a book , the woman needed to be in therapy real fast . There is so much going on in this movie that yentas sitting in front of a building couldn't report it as quickly . Marion is on her 2nd marriage . Her husband is a cold doctor played by Ian Holm . At a pre-wedding party , Holm's first wife came in to slap her husband and condemn Marion for taking her husband away from her . Then , there's Holm's daughter , Martha Plimpton , who gets along very well with Marion but has her own emotional problems . Complicating all this , Marion's mother has died within the past few months , and her father , played by John Houseman , can't really dispose of his wife's belongings . A flashback shows him as a younger man ( played by David Ogden Stiers ) telling his son to work in a cardboard factory so that Marion can go to college . After talking about her friend , the latter suddenly shows up . Sandy Dennis , as the friend , condemns Marion for paying too much attention to her husband as well as a previous boyfriend . How could I forget to mention that Holm's friend , Gene Hackman , makes a play for Marion at the pre-wedding party . In writing her book , Marion can hear a psychiatrist talking in the next room to a patient . ( Mia Farrow ) Later , Marion befriends Farrow and then loses her as the movie thankfully ends . The film , which was Houseman's last , is ridiculous at best . Houseman looked in great pain . ( He died the same year . ) He managed to deliver his lines like Prof . Kingsfield in " The Paper Chase . " Dennis was very swollen , dying of cancer 4 years later , she was probably taking treatments . The best part of this farce is that Marion is recognizing that her marriage to Holm is coming apart . They are never alone and no longer sleep together . Naturally , while in a restaurant with Farrow , Marion sees Holm with a friend . It is tiring to see these emotionally strung-up women and men act out their problems . In a world full of problems , we don't need theirs .
421618	2542703	34274	1.0	That Uncertain Feeling is A Certain Stinker	A really good film to doze off by . This is far better than taking sleeping tablets . When her friends persuade her to go to a psychoanalyst for her hiccups , Merle Oberon complies and finds analyst Alan Mowbray blaming her marriage to Melvyn Douglas as the culprit . It's also there that she meets off-the-wall patient Burgess Meredith . The two pursue an affair and she soon separates from Douglas . The film is just too much to believe . On the rebound , Douglas starts an affair with his attorney's ditsy secretary , a very young Eve Arden . The film is totally unappealing and unassuming to say the least . If this is comedy , forget it ! ! ! ! !
421429	2542703	44762	1.0	The Stalk Should Have Come Down With the Writing for this One	Absolutely inane film starring Abbott and Costello . Even our young children would become increasingly annoyed with this complete mess of a film . Abbott as Dinklepuss . What a look he had on his face . Sure , he had to be part of this dreadful film . Did anyone notice that Costello's mother in the film sounded and looked like Fay Bainter ? Luckily , for Ms . Bainter , that she wasn't in the film . There is really no excitement hear for children . The jokes , if any , are quite stale . Some of the singing is nicely done but the lyrics are ridiculous .
420673	2542703	91306	3.0	No Need to Jump Over this Flash	Poorly scripted film where heroine Whoopi Goldberg works diligently on her computer at a bank only to get involved with spies when her computer connects with them . Carol Kane is totally wasted in a small role as an office worker . Miss Kane , who has the ability to be hilarious with that foolish Brooklyn accent , would have been far better had she been allowed to appear in the caper scenes . As for Stephen Collins , he appears in so many important scenes that it's just a simple matter to figure out if he is with the good guys or bad guys . The scenes where Goldberg's dress is caught in a shredding machine and where she is locked inside a moving telephone booth could have been hilarious but end too quickly . Another scene at the British embassy is also wasted . This apparent spoof of spy movies just doesn't cut it .
420986	2542703	185014	3.0	Wonder Boys is Wonderfully Awful	Disintegrating film and real fast despite an excellent fast . The story starts out well as Michael Douglas , a tenured English professor , is teaching his creative writing class . The film soon falls apart due to the miserable writing . Tobey McGuire portrays one of his students who is sullen , an excellent writer , with constant morbid thoughts . Who really cares about the number of Hollywood stars who committed suicide ? Ridiculous . Never get too cozy with your students . McGuire and others are invited to the home of the Chancellor ( Francees McDormand ) and her mousy-like husband , English Chairman Richard Thomas . Go know that Douglas and McDormand are lovers and she is pregnant by him . All mayhem breaks lose when McGuire steals a coat worn by Marilyn Monroe and kills the Chancellor's dog who has attacked the Douglas character . What follows is a weekend of revealing philosophies and torture for the rest of the audience . The ending is somewhat unexpected . Rip Torn shows up as a guest speaker at some sort of weekend symposium . Robert Downey Jr . portrays the editor for Douglas . Ironically , it's Douglas who is hooked on coke and what not . Wouldn't the part have been more appropriate for Downey ? Of course , nothing really would help this film .
421432	2542703	367089	3.0	How Deep is the Ocean ? Not far Enough for Squid And Whale ?	for " The Squid and the Whale . " This picture has been filmed in Brooklyn , N . Y . and that's how exciting it gets ! Jeff Daniels and Laura Linney , two excellent thespians , are liberal Ph . D husband and wife . Their doctorates are in literature . They were apparent failures in their marriage and as the film begins , they announce their separation . You would think that the film would then be about how the divorce affects their two precocious sons . That's only part of it . The film shows that people who are highly educated really don't know much about parenting . In fact , it's called using some common sense and decency . This includes not cursing in front of your children and not allowing your older son access to dad's " bachelor " pad when he has taken in a female grad student to live with . The latter played by Anna Paquin is suggestive to say the least . Yes , I'll admit that it's nearly 15 years since her undeserved Oscar supporting win for " The Piano . " She has come a long way . As a tennis teacher , Billy Baldwin comes off as an idiot . Calling him a Philistine skirts the issue . Referring to everyone as my brother became downright annoying . Of course , he takes up with Linney to make this film even more unbearable . Daniels has to have symptoms of a coronary before the picture shows some interest but by then the credits start to roll as the elder son rushes from the hospital to the beautiful Brooklyn museum . Linney has a brief moment in the sun as she recounts an affair in Ohio before her marriage . I'm just pointing out that these are inappropriate topics to teenagers , especially those with their own sexual hangups . When the elder son is suggested to go into therapy , Daniels wonders out loud what degrees the " shrink " , as he calls him , has . Children are treated almost like adults and that's a basic flaw with this film . Children are still children and must be dealt with appropriately during a separation and subsequent divorce by parent . The subject matter is interesting but is handled incorrectly .
420384	2542703	195022	3.0	Liberace : Behind the Music-Casts A Sour Note	Too much is attempted to be told in 1 hour and 36 minutes . Victor Garber does turn in a convincing performance as the flamboyant Lee . Maureen Stapleton is his doting mother who appeared on the way to another wonderful performance when the writing for her part did her in . As is the case with all those who orbited around his life , she was there to take full advantage even if it meant attempting to sabotage his one brief stab at a female romance . That being said , even the female took advantage of Lee as well . The music is nicely staged . There is an all too brief scene with his father , the latter having abandoned the family years before . Years later , the father , an apparent Alzheimer's victim , doesn't even remember his son . The film tries to convey that Liberace was virtually trapped by his homosexual tendencies . The film begins to fail as the men in his life begin to come and go . The most tragic of his guys was the 18 year old that he took in to make his chauffeur , only to see him become a cocaine addicted victim who is thrown out by Liberace . He retaliates by filing a palimony suit for millions .
420976	2542703	373926	3.0	The Interpreter Gets Lost in Translation	Muddled , often confusing account of an assassination attempt on an African leader . Nicole Kidman translates an African dialect at the U . N . but how increasingly involved does she become in the assassination plot ? In a post - world , we don't need seeing a Nostrand Ave . bus being blown up . The corrupt African leader looks just like Nelson Mandela ? Were the writers of this junk trying to tell us something ? Penn's wife was just killed in a New Mexico auto accident ? What's the point of all this ? There is no relevance of this tragedy whatsoever to the story . The ending was pointless and confusing . What were the bad guys trying to accomplish ?
421458	2542703	30396	4.0	What's So Mad About Miss Manton ?	Some people say that this Stanwyck-Fonda vehicle was a perfect warm up for their " The Lady Eve " film in 1941 . To me , both were equally bad to the core . This film is so uninteresting that you couldn't care less who committed the murder . Miss Manton finds a dead body in a deserted house and the police department does not believe her . Believe me , who cares ? The film is somewhat redeemed thanks to the performance of Sam Levene as the head of the force . His one liners are memorable as is those of Hattie McDaniel , as Hilda , Miss Manton's maid . Those facial expressions of McDaniel are memorable . She too provides some comic relief in an otherwise droll production . Did anyone notice that in the screen credits , Hilda is listed as Hattie McDaniels ? Fonda appears entirely too stoic in the part of the newspaper reporter who finds himself involved in the case and increasingly romantic with Manton . He appears quite stiff and with the exception of the hospital scene , he isn't funny at all .
421191	2542703	78056	4.0	Paradise Alley is Really from ? ? ? ? ?	An after World War 11 film set in Manhattan where Sylvester Stallone further hurts the image of Italian-Americans with his Rocky like talk . This is most disparaging . At least , the award winning " Rocky " had a good story . In " Paradise Alley " Stallone plays a low-life hustler named Cosmo Carboni . He looks to take advantage of his younger brother's physique by making him a big-time wrestler . An interesting performance here is by Armand Assante as the middle brother . Maimed and bitter by his injuries during the war , he becomes a promoter for his wrestling brother and really doesn't mind when the latter is getting hurt . It's all for the money for him . Assante , in his first film , gives a convincing performance nicely showing the changes that take place with him . This film offers no violence which is one of its few assets . Other than the character development part of Lenny Carboni , ( Assante ) the film offers little else .
420932	2542703	361127	4.0	The Woodsman : Lead Us Away from Temptation	Memo to Kevin Bacon : Making the film " The Mark , " in 1960 , also about a child molester , brought Stewart Whitman an Oscar nomination but may have very well ruined his career . Pay attention Mr . Bacon . Out on parole as a molester , Bacon encounters a condescending cop ( nicely played by up and coming actor Mos Def ) a woman who finally accepts him after professing shock at what he has done ( a chain smoking Kyra Sedgwick-the real Mrs . Kevin Bacon ) and a girl who would allow herself to sit on his lap at a park bench . Mercifully , this film is only 1 hr . and 22 minutes . It is very slow moving and his usual ride on the bus from work becomes tedious to watch . Of course , Bacon finds hostility among fellow workers . The secretary of the office prints out what the computer says about the paroled child molester . This is obviously an extremely difficult subject . Bacon is perplexed . He has to contend with a psychiatrist who seems to provoke him . At the same time , he assaults a man who has taken a child for a ride . for some fine acting by Bacon and Def , but otherwise , forget it .
421534	2542703	67975	4.0	What's the Matter With this Film ?	The film is almost laughable with Debbie Reynolds and Shelley Winters teaming up as the mothers of convicted murderers . With the horrible notoriety after the trial , the two women team up and leave N . Y . for California in order to open and song and dance studio for Shirley Temple-like girls . From the beginning , it becomes apparent that Reynolds has made a mistake in taking Winters with her to California . Winters plays a deeply religious woman who increasingly seems to be going off her rocker . To make matters worse , the women who live together , are receiving menacing phone calls . Reynolds , who puts on a blond wig , is soon romanced by the wealthy father of one of her students , nicely played by Dennis Weaver . Agnes Moorehead , in one of her last films , briefly is seen as Sister Alma , who Winters is a faithful listener of . The film really belongs to Shelley Winters . She is heavy here and heaviness seemed to make her acting even better . Winters always did well in roles testing her nerves . The ending is of the macabre and who can forget Winters at the piano banging away with that totally insane look ?
421578	2542703	39926	4.0	Two Mrs . Carrolls - And Alexis Smith Nearly Makes 3	You've got Humphrey Bogart , Barbara Stanwyck and Alexis Smith in a film and yet it stinks . Where did this film go wrong ? Bogart stars as a crazed killer who has already murdered his first unseen wife and is well on his way to do in wife # 2 played by Barbara Stanwyck . In a way , I thought Miss Stanwyck was using this film as a dress rehearsal for her Oscar nominated performance in the following year for " Sorry , Wrong Number . " Ann Carter stars as Bea , Bogart's daughter from his first marriage . The child is precocious . She sounds like a 40 year old rather than a child of 8 or 9 which she is supposed to be . Nigel Bruce is somewhat effective as the doctor to Stanwyck who loves his " occasional " drink and obsessive talking about the burglar-strangler on the loose . The heavy rain and dark atmosphere adds to eeriness of the production . Problem is that the plot can be figured out in about 10 minutes .
420937	2542703	73692	4.0	Shampoo-Wash That Man Right Out of Your Hair	Disappointing film as Warren Beatty plays a non-homosexual hairdresser who rides around in a motorcycle as if he is part of " Easy Rider . " Obviously , George does more than hair with his clients . The film is Robert Altman-like with its jumping around as it follows Beatty's sex escapades . Julie Christie and Goldie Hawn steal the acting here in their portrayals as two of Beatty's clients . The supporting Oscar went to the usually fabulous Lee Grant . I can't imagine why even though her category was full of weak contenders in 1975 . Beatty's life unravels at a party on election night 1968 . President-elect Richard Nixon promises an open administration , the next day , which is probably the film's greatest laugh . Guys should take heart since Beatty probably gets what he deserves at the film's end . ( No , it's not the " Bonnie & Clyde " shooting . ) Jack Warden received a supporting Oscar nomination for his portrayal of a man who Beatty asks to loan him money so he can open his own beauty salon . Warden is carrying on with Julie Christie , who is also the lover of Beatty but at the same time Beatty is carrying on with Lee Grant , who is wed to Warden . When all this is discovered , it really is not handled that well . This hysterical-like situation could have been dealt with a lot better .
420530	2542703	115710	4.0	Blood and Wine Uneven Drama	Again , a stellar cast cannot help this miserable film . Jack Nicholson and Michael Caine are on a caper to steal a necklace . Nicholson seems to be in a very bad marriage with Judy Davis . Davis is the bright moment in this otherwise uneven drama . She is explosive and pulls out all the stops in her violent scenes with " husband " Nicholson . Caine coughs up a storm here as the dying thief . At least , he got his wish by not dying in prison . Jennifer Lopez appears as the love interest of Nicholson and his stepson-the son of Davis . The films tends to become overly violent . There are frequent uses of sticks to do the beating . Someone should have taken a stick to this film .
421123	2542703	58265	4.0	Kiss Me Stupid is Just That	Imagine a Billy Wilder flop and you have 1964's " Kiss Me Stupid . " Why this picture wasn't in color was beyond me . I see where Wilder was trying to somewhat imitate his 1960 Oscar winner " The Apartment , " but that attempt falls flat . Dean Martin , as Dino , plays himself . While driving to California , he has to take a detour to a remote Nevada town and that's where our story begins . Ray Walston , a piano teacher , and organist in a church is insanely jealous of wife Felicia Farr . He also writes songs with his sidekick Barney . Martin drives up to the house and the two have the idea to get Dino to purchase their songs . To get the swinger Dino in the mood , they substitute Walston's wife for Kim Novak , at her worst , in this film as the original dumb blonde . The story is silly and the title most appropriate .
420800	2542703	45009	4.0	Park Row Takes A Skid Row Course	What could have potentially been a wonderful movie , instead turns into an amateurish like production . I heard that this film could have been made with Gregory Peck and Ava Gardner in Technicolor . It would have been a musical with Peck singing . How delightful that would have been . Instead , we are subjected to an overly simplified production of trying to explain the importance of newspapers . Angered when a newspaper caused the hanging of an innocent man , Gene Evans forms his own paper called the Globe . The Star , the rival paper , is owned by a woman . Soon , a war develops between the papers . An odd sort of people work for the Globe . A typesetter who can't read , a young boy who has his legs sliced off by the competitor's carriage . As the story evolves , there might be a hint of romance between the lady and Evans . This is not pursued as the film ends . When the Globe is bombed , the lady , who has had a change of heart , prints the paper itself . . . . And we have mom and apple pie too . Don't bring up the trial of John Peter Zenger . That was a story . This story of the importance of newspapers would have been better served in an old fashioned western .
420281	2542703	383694	4.0	Vera , Not Nice Dearie ,	Just caught Vera Drake on television as it was shown at 4 o'clock in the morning on Starz . To me , the standout performance is that of Vera's daughter , Ethel , who is either severely retarded or dumbfounded by what is going on in this film . Vera is made to come off as a victim . Her stupidity is unmatched . She knew very well what she was doing . She refused to label it abortion , but would say that she is " helping " girls . Too kind to accept remuneration , did she really believe what she was doing , or is she just plain stupid ? Could our heroine , Vera , rival James Dean as the rebel with a cause ? The real victims here are the family who will have to live through all this . The first hour of this film is tiresome . We can really learn to become performing abortion experts . Suddenly , when caught , British actress Imelda Staunton pulls out crying , wining and a sense of innocence not seen since the crocodile tears of a not-so-innocent Katharine Hepburn , in a plethora of films . The judge will not give Vera the least severe sentence for her misdeeds . An example must be set . At least , he admitted that .
421017	2542703	40366	4.0	See No Force of Evil	John Garfield in another film noir . Problem with this film is in terms of explanation . Why after so many years of estrangement does Garfield want to bring his older brother , Thomas Gomez , a small time gambler into the big time ? Beatrice Pearson makes her first appearance in a brief career . She sounds like and tries to emulate Grace Kelly . Sorry , it doesn't work . As a poor working girl for Gomez , she always seems to be in the wrong place . The big mobster here is Roy Roberts , who was so memorable in 1947's " Gentleman's Agreement , " as the bigoted innkeeper . 20 years later he would take on a similar role in " Hotel . " Garfield is a Wall Street attorney who works for the crooked Roberts . There's also the bookkeeper who can't keep his mouth shut and takes a bullet for it . The ending music where Garfield searches for his dead brother below the bridge is totally inappropriate .
421565	2542703	219965	5.0	Bandits-Crime Does Pay But Never So Nicely	Bruce Willis and Billy Bob Thornton teamed up as bank robbers in this 2001 farce . Thornton plays an intellectual hypochondriac who nonetheless would kill if he had to . Willis is a care-free guy . After escaping from an Oregon prison , the two go on quite a spree , where they invade the homes of bank officials and stay overnight and then take them the following morning to rob the place . Their escapades are absolutely real . The police and bank officials are made to look foolish in the eyes of those viewing this film . Bored and upset with her husband , Cate Blanchett meets up with this dynamic duo and becomes a member of the gang in the way that Patty Hearst did as well as Estelle Parsons in " Bonnie & Clyde . " Unlike Parsons , Blanchett becomes attracted to both of these guys . Their final caper is one for the books and would leave us all saying that crime does pay . Not really as it's really not worth paying to see these fools create themselves as legendary heroes . A good point is that the film lacks violence and in some ways becomes a comical tribute to film bank robbers .
421286	2542703	56671	5.0	Please Cross the Street to Avoid " Walk on Wild Side "	Barbara Stanwyck showed her age as the tormented head of a Baton Rouge brothel in this 1962 film . Laurence Harvey portrays Dov Linkhorn , a man looking for his love , Capucine , who really gives the film's only good performance . Anne Baxter is wasted as a Mexican owner of a restaurant . Her accent is as phony as this film is . The biggest joke here is Jane Fonda , who acts churlish in far too many scenes . The dismal black and white photography here tries to emulate 1951's " Streetcar Named Desire . " That had a story , this has basically nothing . The only male Dov who was memorable on the screen was Sal Mineo's Oscar nominated Dov Landau in 1960's " Exodus . " The film was ahead of its time in trying to depict the apparent lesbian relationship between Stanwyck and Capucine . The former will just not let go and tragedy results . However , it is the body of this picture that suffers . What exactly is going on in this brothel ? It's just not all sex , please ! A major disappointment , even with a star-studded cast .
420812	2542703	66471	5.0	Too Late the Hero - Cliff Robertson's Journey to Demise	As one who could speak Japanese , Cliff Robertson thought that he could ride out World War 11 sunning himself on a beach . His sunning ends when he is called to go on a dangerous mission to the New Hebrides . There he will encounter danger that he never imagined along with a British crew at each other's throat . The goal was to knock out a Japanese transmitter . This is done but the rest of the film becomes a cat and mouse game as Robertson and Michael Caine try to make it back to their base . The cat and mouse game is played with a Japanese official who speaks to them via a loudspeaker urging them to give up . The exciting ending is one that is rather routine though very difficult . The real acting kudos go to Denholm Elliot in a supporting role as one of the British lead soldiers . Interesting but rather routine warfare .
420627	2542703	32021	5.0	They Made Her A Spy is Routine Espionage	You didn't have to be a rocket scientist to realize that the Allan Hale part is one of being a counter spy , just like the lead role of Sally Eilers . The film is basically a routine one where Eilers , following the tragic death of her military brother due to espionage , decides to join and fight spying by herself . There she meets up with all kinds of characters , one which is led by the terrible Dr . Krull , a wonderful Fritz Leiber here . Leiber's very demeanor is the embodiment of evil . The scene where Eilers and Hale pass themselves off as married people to prudish people is absolutely hilarious . You know that the film will end in the way that it does when the 2 return , now married , to the very same boarding house and say they're here on their honeymoon . The expression on the prudish couple is worth the price of admission . Naturally , the film served as a reminder that spies were everywhere , even within the government itself .
420426	2542703	435705	5.0	Ends Before We Really Want to See What Comes Next	High packed action film where the CIA wishes to thwart a terrorist plot by using a magician , Nicholas Cage , who has the power to see what is going to happen in the future . The problem with the film is that it goes down in quality rather rapidly once the chase scenes start . We see cars crashing and all sorts of wood flying away causing havoc . Julianne Moore , a fine actress , does an excellent job as a tough enforcement agent . Surprised to see that Russia is involved in the terrorist plot rather than the conventional middle eastern countries . The film is fast-paced and there is a romantic side to it once Cage involves a lady , who in turn is recruited by the CIA to capture Cage . Once Cage is taken by the CIA , we want to see more of how the agency will further go after the terrorists . Instead , the film ends .
421025	2542703	33664	5.0	Girl-Guy-Gob -	Lucille Ball was much more restrained in this 1941 comedy with Edmond O'Brien and George Murphy . O'Brien appears so young and dashing in this film . He plays an upper class businessman who meets and finds love with secretary Ball . Murphy plays her sailor boyfriend . To me , the biggest question in the film was who would Murphy wind up with ? The comedy here is tedious . O'Brien has a snobbish girlfriend with a high society mother to the bargain . Ball comes from a real common family where the brother finds opera tickets that belong to O'Brien . By the next scene , Ball is going to apply for a job where O'Brien is the owner . How coincidental can we get ?
421010	2542703	435623	5.0	This Conversation is Endless	Aaron Eckhardt and Helena Bonham-Carter provide the right chemistry as people who meet at the wedding of his sister and begin a night of passion . True is that they had met years before . As the evening goes on , we find out about their previous relationship and marriages . The problem here is that the film is way too talkative . The conversations are endless and drawn out . The hotel room scene seems like it shall never end . Filming the scene is double-scene sequence is a good idea and would have worked even better if the surroundings had changed more . Even when the two part at the end of the film , we don't know for sure if the relationship has ended for good . This could certainly be a " Same Time Next Year " event and the sequel would probably be even better than this .
421005	2542703	414387	5.0	Pride and Prejudice-Pardon My Bias	Jane Austen's novel continues to be a bore when it's transferred to the screen . Despite the great 1940 cast of Greer Garson and Edna Mae Oliver , the film didn't exactly catch fire and the same is true for this 2005 remake . Elizabeth is a highly intelligent girl . Her parents are played well by Donald Sutherland and Brenda Blethyn . The latter should be used if ever they make the life-story of Sara Allgood . She is in fine form as the doting mother who wants to see her daughters married off into wealth and happiness . Allgood ? She ought to be the Irish answer to the Jewish mother . Keira Knightley is beautiful and gives a restrained Oscar nominated performance as the eldest daughter . She meets up with Mr . Darcy , a brooding character , who is both angry and frustrated with life in general . His nature is to almost cause misery for the family until things are straightened out by explanation and he emerges as not such a bad Joe after all . In her brief role as Darcy'd aunt , Dame Judi Dench nearly steals the picture with her vicious performance as a wealthy dowager , who looks down on the family and tries to prevent Elizabeth marrying Darcy . Dench has made quite a success in brief screen performances as she did in her supporting Oscar win for " Shakespeare in Love . " The cinematography and set decorations are elegant and quite in order for the period of history they represent . The problem here is with the writing . We can't see all at once why Darcy is such a brooding character . His emergence as a person is also not adequately explained .
420729	2542703	33467	5.0	Citizen Kane-Forever Seeking Rosebud	Perhaps , I am missing something here but what's the big fuss regarding " Citizen Kane ? " A masterpiece , no way ! In 1941 the motion picture academy selected " How Green Was My Valley " as the best picture of the year and this is one person who wholeheartedly agreed with the academy's decision . This movie starring Orson Welles as the fictional Charles Foster Kane was not at all interesting , especially when it was supposedly based on the life of William Randolph Hearst . Had they spoken more about the Hearst Newspapers , his castle in San Francisco , and his affair with Marion Davies , we would have had a far better picture . The picture conveys Kane as an absolute tyrant with a whole host of people around his orbit . Everett Sloane was excellent as Bernstein . The part I liked best was when Kane thought that he would be elected governor and the disappointment that was etched on his face when this did not occur . Rosebud . . .
421381	2542703	40109	5.0	Reteaming of Boyer and Bergman Doesn't Really Work-Arch of Triumph	Even the re-teaming of Ingrid Bergman and Charles Boyer in this 1948 film doesn't help it very much . At least , unlike the 1985 version , Paris is not that lugubrious . While war is about to break out in September , 1939 , Paris is still very much a city of lights , and much is happening in the outdoor cafés . The story is one of an ill-fated affair between a chanteuse and doctor , both refugees from Nazism . Boyer and Bergman are lovers but events and extremely bad timing make for the inevitable tragedy . As always , Charles Laughton is the personification of evil , this time as a Nazi official who loves to visit gay Paris for a variety of reasons , one being to keep check on German citizens who have fled Nazi Germany . The chemistry between Bergman and Boyer is fine , but the story needs to be jazzed up somewhat . It's extremely slow-moving . An interesting performance is given by Louis Calher , as Boris , a friend of Boyer . I loved his line that history doesn't make accommodations . This movie's writing didn't make the necessary accommodations either .
420909	2542703	758766	5.0	Music & Lyrics - It's Not The Sound of Music	Hugh Grant does a wonderful take off as a rock singer attempting to make a comeback . The problem is that there isn't much to go by here . As for Drew Barrymore's portrayal of Sophie Fisher , the part really requires a quirky young girl . That's another problem here as Drew's interpretation of Sophie is anything but quirky . Naturally , the two meet when it's determined that Sophie can write lyrics . The problem they encounter is that they have to write a song for a Brittany Spear look-alike who sounds really just awful . Sophie doesn't like what they have written but of course love shall conquer all . It usually does in these silly pictures . Nevertheless , this was a fairly nice change of pace for the usual foolish Grant . At least , in this film , he is a washed-up rock singer who needs a hit record . Alas , this picture is no hit .
420779	2542703	44557	5.0	Don't Bother to Knock - Have Patience	As far as Marilyn Monroe being a gifted actress , forget it . In this dramatic film she sounds just like her in musical comedy films with that baby intonation voice . Please . Anne Bancroft , as Lyn , the lounge singer should have had the title role here . Did Bancroft actually do her own singing here ? The best performance in this film by far was by Verna Felton as a busy-body resident of the hotel , always complaining , and luckily she was on hand at the right time . Richard Widmark's character is interesting here . Starting out as a guy who wants a fast good time , he rises to the occasion when he sees how off the wall Nell ( Monroe ) is . Marilyn Monroe always dreamed of being a dramatic actress . The drama part was way out of her league . She excelled in musical comedies such as " Some Like it Hot , " and " There's No Business Like Show Business . " Those were her pictures . Her only reasonable dramatic performances came in " River of No Return " and " Niagara . " This film " Don't Bother to Knock " really showed us what the nut houses have always been about . Take them in and release them no matter what's currently going on .
421220	2542703	56575	6.0	" That Touch of Mink " Are Minks A Girl's Best Friend ?	Funny Cary Grant-Doris Day tale about a woman on the way for an interview who becomes the victim of a car splashing incident . Adviser Gig Young is given money to compensate Miss Timberlake ( Doris ) but she is so angry that she goes to tell him off but is instead swept off her feet by the extremely wealthy Grant . Audrey Meadows is in rare form as a wise-cracking matron at the local cafeteria . Thinking that it is Young who is the Casanova , she hits him several times . The movie though is quickly reduced to silly fanfare with both Day and Grant breaking out in blotches as they work their way through nerves to love . The antics are pretty predictable . Grant and Day have the right chemistry but the story line bogs down .
421392	2542703	337978	6.0	Live Free or Die Hard-Just the Same Old Explosions	We've seen this so many times before . Disgruntled employees turning into maniacs when they're rejected by the employer . Vicious girlfriends who do kung-fu and heroes such as Bruce Willis who come to the rescue despite the fact that their own child , alienated from them , is in danger . The special effects make this movie . Willis is as bald and vulgar as ever . His response to the villain is that he can find his wicked girlfriend at the bottom of the heap with a car up her . Naturally , there is a nerd in this film who is a computer hack and wanted for his services by both sides . Of course , the guy falls for Bruce's daughter . They're both kidnapped . Give me a break already . Children could write this constant script .
420582	2542703	50212	6.0	Bridged too Far	This Oscar winning film of 1957 , " The Bridge on the River Kwai , " is a little too heavy handed . One of the prisoners has it right , " won't building this bridge be seen as an act of treason ? " Captured by the Japanese , Col . Nicholson and his men agree to build such a bridge . They put a tremendous effort into it . At no time is there ever a discussion of trying to escape . What would John Wayne have done ? Nicholson's lame excuse is that in years to come people will thank the English for building the bridge . He anticipates a world at peace with respect and toleration for all cultures . Baloney . You're at war , Mr . Nicholson . At the end , Nicholson cries out in regret , " What have I done ! , " as he collapses and destroys the bridge . What was the writer really thinking . As always , William Holden is effective , this time as an ant-war hero caught up in this predicament . Jack Hawkins acts in his usual bombastic overbearing way . The cinematography is beautiful but the story itself is far from the realm of reality . War is war .
421131	2542703	45566	6.0	A Blueprint for Murders " Peters " Out	Interesting film soon falls flat . Joseph Cotten , a reserved heavy smoking businessman , shows up just in time when his young niece dies suddenly in the hospital . Joe's brother and sister-in-law are already gone , and before his death , the brother had remarried the lovely Jean Peters . A young nephew survives . What seems to be a routine tragedy soon develops into murder by poisoning . When it becomes obvious that Peters has killed her step-daughter , Cotten and others must prove it and at the same time protect the young nephew from the conniving killer . The film falls flat once Cotten follows Peters and the young nephew on to a boat where she is taking the young lad to see Europe and probably come to his death . Cotten's scheme is to kill his sister-in-law before she kills the little boy . Far-fetched but not out of the realm of a world gone crazy is the plot to this film . The entire problem here is that it's almost impossible for anyone to pin the murder on Peters . It appears that after supposedly poisoning Miss Peters at the end , Cotten seems to have gone awry . The poison doesn't seem to be working proving that those aspirins with the w on them weren't poison after all . . . . But were they ?
421138	2542703	39725	6.0	" Possessed " The Devil Made Her Do It	Poor Joan Crawford . In her 1945 Oscar-winning performance , she was victimized by a wretched daughter . 2 years later Miss Crawford was nominated again for having a stepdaughter-in-law almost get the man that she wanted . ( Van Heflin ) Pity Raymond Massey in this " Possessed " mess . His first wife , a mentally ill woman , commits suicide and Crawford plays the nurse that had taken care of her . She marries Massey on the rebound after being spurned by Heflin . Trouble is that Crawford is a schizophrenic with grand delusions . While the ending is tragic , how can she claim insanity as a defense ? She was overly in love with the Heflin character and was overbearing to put it mildly . Geraldine Brooks has some good moments as the stepdaughter but I generally feel this picture was done to cash in on the success of " Mildred Pierce . " It doesn't work .
421580	2542703	115580	6.0	The Associate - You Could Associate With This	Women's lib would really go for this 1996 film about a woman who loses a promotion to her fellow worker despite her better experience and seniority . Since she will now be a subordinate to this guy , she quits and forms her own investment group . She is aided by a very frumpy Dianne Wiest . When she can't get anywhere due to her sex , she invents a male partner to get her ideas accepted . The film is a funny one and when Whoopi is forced to " produce " this partner , she gets a costume with the white face of a Marlon Brando mixed with a Thomas Jefferson profile and hair-do . That part is really hilarious . Of course , there is more fun ahead when Whoopi is accused of killing this partner and Wiest is accused of being an accessory to murder . With all this , the film is highly predictable but go enjoy it anyway .
420568	2542703	356680	6.0	The Family Stone - Too Many Stones Unturned ?	Dermott brings Sarah Jessica home for Christmas to meet his family and propose marriage . Every conceivable thing goes wrong and the family can't warm up to her . In the midst , Dermott has a deaf-mute brother who is gay and living with a black gentleman . Another sister has broken off with her beau and there is still another brother . Things get out of hand and Sarah Jessica runs out and the other brother runs after her . When things started to go wrong , Sarah Jessica called her sister to come over . Claire Danes is the sister who does so little in the film . As you can expect , the other brother falls for Sarah Jessica and the same is true for the other couple . Haven't we seen this so many times previously ? In addition , the parents are played by Craig T . Nelson , who looks like he is ready to resume playing " Coach " after this and the usual free-spirited Diane Keaton , who has a secret to reveal that she is terminal . You can just imagine what the last scene is like a year later without Miss Keaton . A highly predictable film dealing with when things aren't and are supposed to be . The best scene is one on television showing Judy Garland singing " Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas " when everything has come out .
421305	2542703	46931	6.0	Dragnet-More than Just the Facts Are Needed	Jack Webb and Ben Alexander , the two television icons of " Dragnet , " made this 1954 film . As an inducement to get people to see it , the film was colorized . The television show was black and white . The story centers on a runner who is rubbed out at the beginning . Unlike the television show , the killers are shown at the beginning so there is no guessing game . More action was needed . This film was made as if it were for television . There are two very good supporting performances by Virginia Gregg , as the widow of the murder victim . Her scene of utter despair and drunkeness was memorable . When it showed her on one foot , your heart could give out . Also noteworthy was Georgia Ellis ' portrayal of the murderer's wife , hard-boiled and abusive to police , she soon changes her ways when her husband is knocked off . We have the usual elements of police harassment , but this time it's more than justified , a witness who is scared off , thereby making the case harder to get to the guilty . When the head of the mob falls victim to cancer at the end , we can all say , " He deserved it . " Speaking of the latter dread disease , the film is marred in a way by Joe Friday's ( Webb's ) chronic smoking . The latter probably led to his early demise from a coronary some years ago .
420613	2542703	47811	7.0	All that A Good Movie Allows	In honor of their 1954 hit , Magnificent Obsession , Hollywood decided to team Jane Wyman and Rock Hudson again for another tear-jerker . This one is All that Heaven Allows . Jane is a widow again who falls for the town gardener , nice played by Rock Hudson . Since Ron is much younger than the Wyman character , the town gossips led by Mona , an excellent Jacqueline de Wit , have a field day . The inference immediately is that the two must have had a relationship while Wyman was still wed . As was the case with so many Jane Wyman films , Agnes Moorehead is part of this one too . She again plays an understanding friend , Sara . She attempts to warn her friend of the gossip with its ramifications . I found Moorehead to be weak here . Sirk would have been better served to have her in the Mona role . Moorehead could play real vicious when prompted to . Bowing to the town gossip and her adult children , Wyman breaks off with Ron only to find herself alone with her new television set . It has to take an accident for true love to intervene as the film ends . for Wyman and Hudson lovers . As Jane Wyman in well into her 90s now , wouldn't it be nice if her masterpiece picture of 1951 , The Blue Veil , were shown ? The film is currently in litigation . Time to get this gem of a film out of mothballs .
421069	2542703	480025	7.0	This is England-Union Jack at its Worst	Here we go again . An 11 year old loses his dad in 1983 in the Falklands War . Bullied in school and very unhappy with his life , our young chap , who gives a wonderful performance , is recruited by a bunch of skin-headed losers . He resorts to violence . My criticisms of the film include his mother who scolds the group for keeping her son late and then goes on her merry way and the boy becomes a bona fide member . The film wants us to evoke sympathy for this brat . Yes , I call him a brat because of his actions . Not everyone who loses a parent at 11 resorts to such behavior . Let's stop making excuses for this type of recalcitrant conduct . The film does have redeeming value when the boy sees the death of a black member by the leader is a rage caused by the use of drugs . Question : Since when is a black person allowed to be in such a group ?
421354	2542703	407265	7.0	Transamerica Transcends All	Oscar Nominee Felicity Huffman gives a wonderful performance in this film . Unhappy with life and unable to make decisions , this male wants a sex change operation . Before she can have it , she discovers that she fathered a child with a woman now deceased . The character meets the kid and the two travel cross country on a self-revealing journey . A lot of these cross country films such as " Harry and Tonto " deal with human self-discovery while the journey is made . Transamerica is no exception . It follows the pair as they live , experience and as they come to find out their true relationship . This is a film dealing with the acceptance of a transsexual person in society . There are comic over-tones but the picture takes on a lot of meaning when Huffman comes face to face with her parents , especially the mother who could really never accept the situation . This film nicely challenges social mores and values .
420335	2542703	43590	7.0	Go for Broke Tackles Prejudice	Japanese-Americans serving in the U . S . army during World War 11 is the central theme of this film . How ironic that this occurred while we were placing other Japanese-Americans in internment camps during this period . Van Johnson harbors prejudice as he chosen to shape these recruits up . While he runs into difficulty with top brass , he does his job well . He comes to understand and appreciate his men . When he meets up with his old Texas regiment , he fights someone for passing an anti-Japanese remark . The Japanese players do a good job of showing that their true spirits were with the U . S . A totally satisfying film depicting the human spirit .
420583	2542703	34891	7.0	The Ship Comes First	When " In Which We Serve " was made in 1942 , England was in the midst of its finest hour . We see a film of honor , devotion , and loyalty to the realm . It is basically the story of a boat being torpedoed and the flashbacks of 3 sailors aboard the doomed wreckage . Noel Coward , a brilliant talent , did not perform well here . His scenes with his children appear awkward and he is unusually cold towards them . While a war is going on , that strong sentiment of a loving friendly tie is missing . Kudos go to Celia Johnson , as Alix , his wife in the film . She states in a memorable way that in the navy , devotion to the ship comes first . John Mills is also effective as a navy man . In a heart-wrenching scene , he must tell a fellow shipman that his wife and mother-in-law have been killed in the blitz . The ending is poignantly done . A tear will come to the eye as Coward says goodbye to those who survived the torpedoed ship . A film of valor and of the human spirit . England was certainly at its finest hour .
420829	2542703	364603	7.0	Plain Song Not Exactly Missing Themes	Interesting but too many plots bring this film down . We have a teacher who is pressured to pass a miserable child so that they can get him out of the school despite the fact that the brat assaulted the teacher . The teacher ( Aidan Quinn ) has a wife who has left him , apparently suffering from depression and has gone to her sister in Denver . There are 2 young polite boys from the marriage who eventually find an old lady dead in her apartment . They deliver the paper to her and never bother to report that the woman , who lost her son in Korea , has died . The boys get caught up with that miserable student , who has bigoted parents . If this isn't enough , we have America Fererra , who has been abandoned by her mother when it is determined that she is pregnant . She goes to live with 2 older gentlemen who have kept to themselves following the deaths of their parents . They are recommended by the teacher in the next room who has romantic visions on Quinn . The school secretary also has an eye on this man . Yes , the movie is interesting but the themes abound . Each character could have developed into a story by itself . Was the teacher motivating the student ? The pressure that teachers are faced with to pass students according to their supervisors is another theme . The depression of the mother . The life of the old woman ( Marion Seldes ) and the 2 older gentlemen who find they can contribute to life . I could go on and on .
420542	2542703	57090	7.0	Gather Your Rosebuds-Human Element Shines	Forget the technical aspects of explaining what the function of these fliers are . It was a tedious explanation at the beginning of the flick and was as confusing as Price Waterhouse's explanation of voting procedures at the Oscars each year and as boring and difficult as Ethel Weintraub's chemistry class at Erasmus Hall H . S . in Brooklyn . The film begins to take shape when it discusses the human element . Rock Hudson portrays a hard driven commander who pushes his men to the limit so as to prepare our people in aviation for a war emergency . In the process of doing this , Hudson ruins the life of veteran Barry Sullivan . The former feels that Sullivan can no longer cope with the difficulty of the job and forces him into retirement . This retirement causes Sullivan's son to leave Stanford and the Sullivan character placing a bullet in his body in a suicide attempt . Rock , as Col . Caldwell , ameliorates the situation by visiting Sullivan in the hospital and gets him to say that he will strive for excellence in his new position in civilian life . Hudson also tries to get rid of Rod Taylor as he believes that the latter has become too chummy with the men . It is while Hudson is visiting Sullivan at the hospital that a simulated emergency occurs which tests the strengths of all . Mary Peach plays the British wife of Hudson . Her performance is not peachy-keen . When she first walks off a plane to meet her husband in an early scene , you would think that Queen Elizabeth was playing the part . A good film relating to working with men in a difficult but often unexplained task . Rod Taylor and Mr . Hudson can't be commended for their excessive smoking in this film . Is this what our army brass has come to ?
420955	2542703	39881	7.0	T-Men Make Sure You Infiltrate this Film	Two treasury agents infiltrate a dangerous gang of counterfeiters in this exciting 1947 film . The two are able to be accepted by the gangsters due to excellent detective and preparation on their parts . The heartbreaking scene where one of them was killed was skillfully done . The camera image of Dennis O'Keefe , after his cohort is killed , was memorable . Also memorable was the one scene that June Lockhart appeared in . Realizing that her husband is on assignment and unable to reveal himself , Lockhart plays along . Later , her husband is killed . Wallace Ford is excellent as a mob stooge . Another great film noir by director Anthony Mann . It is only at the very end that the head of these people is revealed . We never saw this person throughout the film .
420576	2542703	375679	7.0	Crash Survives and Makes the Grade	This is not a film that will promote racial understanding but it certainly shows what can happen when we don't do this . " Crash " really refers to the cultural differences within the framework of a system that may very well be against us from our date of birth . There is redemption and miracles depicted here . The film is headed by an all-star cast . Matt Dillon , nominee for best supporting actor , steals the show as a racist cop who comes down to reality when the situation demands it . Otherwise , he is an out of control bigot , angry at the system for what it did to his father who practiced racial toleration and was victimized by reverse racism in his profession . Dillon has his moments in his emotional outbursts and could very well be walking down the aisle on March 5 . On March 5 , 2006 the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences chose " Crash " as the year's best picture . Thinking back , I saw a very small but important similarity to the great 1947 Oscar best picture winner , " Gentleman's Agreement . " The two films show a similarity in that they tackle prejudice by hitting the nail right on the head . " Crash " will be a very important film as the years go on . There are other strong performances by Don Cheadle , as a savvy officer who , in neglecting a family problem , is blamed by his mother when tragedy strikes . I would have liked the Brendon Fraser and Sandra Bullock parts expanded . He is a D . A . and she is his wife . Their car is hijacked and he wants a black to be named in an important position for political purposes . Then , their parts seem to go limp . This is a film of racial and cultural misunderstanding well done .
420595	2542703	42771	7.0	Mystery Street is A Taut Thriller	Jan Sterling is a pick up lady who is pregnant . When she calls the father , he blows her away in a secluded area . Problem is that Marshall Thompson is on a drunken binge following the death of his son during childbirth . Sterling lures Thompson into his car and then steals it . When she is killed , the killer ditches the car and several months later Sterling's skeleton is found along with the awfully wet car . Excellent detective work by cop Ricardo Montalban and as a Harvard professor turned sleuth Bennett leads to the arrest of Thompson , thus destroying his life with his wife , nicely played by Sally Forest . Elsa Lanchester steals the movie as a snoopy , vicious landlady , whose greed shall lead to her demise as well . Well done picture by showing how the real killer is caught at the end . This is film noir at its very best .
421569	2542703	27214	7.0	. . . More like The Whole Town is Mistaken	John Ford directed this 1935 comedy . Edward G . Robinson has an absolute field-day in a double role portraying a plain , introverted office worker who is mistaken for a major gangster . The fun begins when the gangster breaks out of jail and the usually hilarious Donald Meek identifies our poor worker . Jean Arthur co-stars as a fellow office worker . The confusion goes on and on with the gangster taking refuge at our worker's apartment . The latter has to get a letter from the police to hold onto so that he is not arrested . Later , he is taken in protective custody only to have the real thief take his place so that the latter can knock off someone in jail who has bad-mouthed him . The ending certainly shows that crime does not pay .
421526	2542703	46935	7.0	Drive A Crooked Rode Hits Right Path	Hell hath no fury like a man scorned . Mickey Rooney starts out as if he is a Danny Kaye milque-toast character . Taken in by Diane Foster , he soon meets up with 2 guys who want his driving talent to be used in there robbing a bank . Rooney is great here as he goes from a quite guy , afraid of really living to aiding the guys in the heist . Hurt by the betrayal of Foster , she shows compassion at the end and this leads to tragedy as Rooney becomes a killer . This is really film-noir at its very best . The robbery was a complete success but the thieves were done in by personal reactions . This one is worth catching .
421087	2542703	340855	8.0	O What a Wonderully Done Monster !	Charlize Theron well deserved her best actress Oscar for " Monster . " The person who did her make-up should have received one as well . Ms . Theron is marvelous as serial killer Aileen Wuornos , a prostitute who went on a killing spree . Theron received remarkable support from Christina Ricci , who played a young girl seduced by Wuornos . Ricci's face shows her unhappiness and disturbance and ultimate betrayal of her lover . The film does suffer from clichés such as Wuornos's attempt to justify the killings . Raped at age 8 by her father's friend , she would be subjected to abuse by the father as well . When she is found guilty of the killings and sentenced to death , Wuornos screams that you're killing a raped girl . Does this life history excuse her from what she did ? Not even a psychiatrist would be able to justify this .
420833	2542703	119848	8.0	Out to Sea-Go Down to the Sea in Ships to Catch this One	Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon , both of whom are sadly missed , proved once again that they were a team dedicated to their craft of bringing hilarious moments to the screen . This film is just another example of this . This time out they play two brothers-in-law who land on a ship as dance instructors on board . Of course , their boss is a perfectionist and miserable person named Gil Godwin who just enjoys harassing these boys . It's hilarious how Lemmon gives a quick lesson in dancing to Matthau and how the latter dances a riotous rumba with the boat's owner Rue McLanahan . Too bad that fellow dance instructors Hal Linden and Donald O'Connor are given so little to do but their parts call for that . Matthau falls for Dyan Cannon , on board with her fellow gold-digging mother , the usual outrageous Elaine Stritch . Unknown to them , Matthau has no money either . The widower Lemmon falls for Gloria De Haven , looking lovelier than ever . The film belongs to Matthau and Lemmon and will serve as a further tribute to their illustrious careers .
421049	2542703	33918	8.0	Mama Miami ! Moon Over Miami	Light fanfare with Bette Grable , Don Ameche , Bob Cummings , and Carol Landis in a fun-filled film . The Technicolor by the always reliable Natalie Kalmus in really great here . We never get tired of plots dealing with 3 ladies trying to get rich guys for themselves . This picture isn't How to Marry a Millionaire ( 1953 ) but it's enjoyable along with the marvelous dancing and singing . As the aunt , Charlotte Greenwood joins in the fun . Did anyone notice how depressed Carol Landis looked ? She would kill herself 7 years later . Jack Haley , as the snooping butler , is a joy to watch . He provides an excellent foil to Miss Greenwood .
421574	2542703	44760	8.0	Ivanhoe-Bring on the Anglo-Saxons and Normans	" Ivanhoe , " filmed in bright techicolor was nominated for best picture in 1952 . Miklos Rosza again provides us with a major musical score . I always felt that his scores , so rich in textures , would be a prelude to his Oscar-winning score in " Ben-Hur . " ( 1959 ) The film deals with the ongoing fight between the Anglo-Saxons and Normans , the latter having ruled England since the infamous Battle of Hastings in 1066 . While fighting in the crusades , Richard the Lionhearted has been kidnapped and held captive in Austria . This has been done with the help of the Austrian emperor Leopold and Prince John , Richard's evil brother , who assumes the throne in his brother's absence . I laughed at the beginning of the film when Robert Taylor , who plays Ivanhoe , loyal to Richard , asks someone for a translation as he doesn't read Austrian . Didn't they mean German ? While it is true that Germany did not become a unified country until 1871 following the Franco-Prussian war , the dialect spoken in the entire region was German . Taylor rallies to the aid of his people . Hurt , he is given refuge by the Jewess Rebecca , played with warmth and skill by Elizabeth Taylor . Her father , Isaac the Jew , played by the always serious Felix Aylmer , promises to help pay the ransom for Richard so that his people can have religious toleration in England . Naturally , Rebecca loves Ivanhoe but so does Lady Rowena played by a much reserved Joan Fontaine . Her guardian , the father of Ivanhoe in the film , is portrayed by Finlay Currie , who played in numerous bible films . The Technicolor and cinematography are breathtaking in the film . A story of love and devotion , especially that of George Sanders , who sacrifices all for Rebecca .
420360	2542703	57877	8.0	Becket - Men for All Seasons	Very good moral conflict is depicted here dealing with a man's devotion to his king and to the lord . When you think of it , Richard Burton's troubles began when Henry 11 , played masterfully by Peter O'Toole , appointed him as the Archbishop of Canterbury . Burton soon takes his position very seriously and this will lead to the tragic conflict between these 2 figures . Burton's Becket and O'Toole's Henry are fantastically done by these thespians . Both earned well earned Oscar nominations for their performances that year as well as John Gielgud in a supporting role as France's King Louis . After viewing this film , we can see how lucky Oscar winner Rex Harrison ( " My Fair Lady " ) was that both Burton and O'Toole were nominated . Martita Hunt excels as Henry's strong-willed mother . 1964 was quite a year for Ms . Hunt . That same year she starred as a member of a European royal family in " The Unsinkable Molly Brown . " A flaw in " Becket " is showing the transition of Burton from a lecherous individual to servant of the lord . This transition occurs too quickly and is unbelievably hard to fathom .
420558	2542703	33149	9.0	They Drive By Night An Excellent Vehicle	Wow ! Ida Luppino gives a memorable performance in this Humphrey Bogart , George Raft film . Ida was such an under-rated actress . What did she have to do to win an Oscar yet alone be nominated ? That's right , Ida Luppino was never nominated for an Oscar even though she would win the New York City Film Critics award in 1942 for " The Hard Way . " Unbelievable ! In this film she plays the frustrated wife of truck owner Alan Hale . Trapped in a bad marriage , she desires for lust but certainly can't get that from the happy-go-lucky Hale . When the Bogart-Raft brothers come to work for Hale , Luppino thinks she has found romance with one of the brothers . She decides to end her marriage by killing Hale with gas fumes from his car . When spurned by her suitor , she allows him to be blamed for Hale's death . Her crack-up scene in court at film's end must be one of the greatest scenes filmed on screen . Hysterically shouting that the doors made her do it , Luppino proved one again that she was one of Hollywood's greatest femme fatales . Ann Sheridan proved her mettle in the film as well . This picture was sort of a warm up for two years later for Sheridan , when she made a hit as Ronald Reagan's girl friend in the 1942 memorable " King's Row . "
421149	2542703	175959	9.0	A Great Night and Beautiful Day	Beautiful biography of Cole Porter wonderfully realized by Cary Grant in the title role . Many criticized the film due to the fact that Porter's homosexuality was omitted . What they fail to recognize in their criticism is that we're dealing with 1945 . Our moral behavior was so differently viewed at that time . The affluent Porter family wanted him to study law ; with his gift for songwriting , he had other ideas . Jane Wyman , as Gracie , is wonderful as well as Mary Martin portraying herself . Donald Woods is a loyal friend along with a very young newcomer to the screen , Dorothy Malone . Monty Woolley plays himself , a stuffed shirt , in a great performance . A college professor , who gave everything up to pursue Porter in California , only to achieve a remarkable movie career for himself . The Porter songs come alive especially the title song-Night and Day . Cary Grant was meant for the role . He alternates beautifully , handling the musical part greatly and gives a wonderful performance when it came to Porter's personal life-especially his war injury and other accident that followed . The film probably marked the end of Jane Wyman's career in musicals . She did quite well as Gracie , discovered by Porter in his early years and then transferring with him to Broadway and success . With the exception of singing In the Cool , Cool , Cool of the Evening with Bing Crosby in 1951's " Here Comes the Groom , " Wyman fled to strong dramatic roles after " Night and Day . " Mary Martin's heart certainly belonged to daddy . She belted out her classic song in the film . Ginny Simms was wonderful here singing a variety of Porter tunes . Too bad that her career really never took off . Alexis Smith , adequate for the part of Linda , really acted subservient until she leaves the workaholic Porter . The ending where they come together and embrace was typical Hollywood all the way . With beautiful set decorations and the Porter music , the film is memorable . Monty Woolley is a steal scener as Porter's friend , a college professor at Yale , who gave up his professorship for a stage and screen career .
420302	2542703	52451	9.0	Bonanza Certainly Was For All of Us	As part of our late 1950s vocabulary , we well knew the Ponderosa , Little Joe , Hoss , Ben Cartwright , etc . on that great show " Bonanza . " It came Saturday night and everyone was glued to the television set . This was a real show depicting family values . There may have been a weekly crisis , but it was the strong family atmosphere that pulled everyone together . Lorne Greene was dominant as the patriarch of the family . His words depicted wisdom . We often were left to wonder that Ben Cartwright , a widower , must have been the best of husbands to that poor wife of his who had died . He reared wonderful sons . Naturally , we all wondered why Pernell Roberts left the show . The show was a gold mine and Roberts surrendered loads of money when he departed . His career never took off as he was associated as a Cartwright son . He should have tried to get back into the series . He certainly lost a bonanza by dropping out .
420762	2542703	30317	9.0	Kentucky-Family Feuds Make for Great Memorable Filming	Terrific film dealing with the horse racing scene in Kentucky . We are taken from the beginning of the civil war , when generations of feuding between families begin when a Goodwin is killed by a Dillon during the taking of horses for the union army . The film then jumps to 1938 and the generations that followed these families . Naturally , Loretta Young and Richard Greene will become lovers and are from the different families with Greene hiding his Dillon name . Walter Brennan is absolutely magnificent here as the older Peter Dillon , who cried hysterically at the time of his father's murder in 1861 . He plays a crusty , cantankerous individual with a rare knowledge of horse breeding and with it all , a wonderful human heart . His Academy Award as best supporting actor was extremely well deserved here . The blue grass of Kentucky was never more enjoyable in this sprawling film of great memories of a bygone era .
420517	2542703	63356	9.0	No Way to Treat A Lady is A Treat to Moviegoers	Rod Steiger was sensational in this 1968 film . His ability to disguise himself and play so many different parts as an insane killer was just fabulous to watch . Yes , the film was definitely an eerie won but you never know what's coming next . Eileen Heckart was just fabulous as the Jewish mother of her son-the police officer , played so well by George Segal . You just wonder when Heckart , Segal and girlfriend , Lee Remick , will be drawn into the web of this serial killer who seems to strike without reason . Who can ever forget his first venture into killing disguised as a priest ? Rod Steiger had a definite field day with this film . Dealing with the macabre , it was truly a memorable film .
420794	2542703	58808	9.0	Green Acres Was the Place to Be	Both the late Eddie Albert and Eva Gabor found their niche in this mid 1960s television classic . Green Acres is the place to be . Fun living , etc . N . Y . is where I'd rather be . I get allergic smelling hay . Darling I love you but give me Park Avenue . The chores . . . The storesYou are my wife . . . Goodbye city life . Green Acres , etc . This show theme song , abbreviated since I can't remember all the exact words , depicted the ongoing struggle between Oliver Wendell Holmes ( Albert ) and his wife , memorably played by Eva Gabor . Fed up with urban life , Oliver moves the clothes-horse Eva to the country to embark on a new life filled with fresh air . The show depicted the weekly adventures of these two people attempting to adjust to rural life . The basic theme here was that love conquers all . This marvelous show certainly did .
421611	2542703	37557	9.0	Money Can Be Everything-Brewster's Millions	Dennis O'Keefe in a field day romp in Brewster's Millions . He becomes an instant millionaire through inheritance but in order to get the full $8 million , he must spend $1 million by age 30 , which is in 2 months . He is not permitted to tell anyone why he is spending money as if there is no tomorrow . Naturally , his love-life will be adversely affected . Of course , when this occurs , O'Keefe gets that Midas Touch . Everything and everyone he touches yields a gold-mine . As his butler , Eddie ' Rochester ' Anderson has lots of fun here and you can see that he is enjoying himself . . The film co-stars Helen Walker as his befuddled girlfriend and there is a nice turn by June Havoc , as a flashy Broadway show-girl , caught up in this mayhem . The picture succeeds because of the fine performance of O'Keefe who has the part of the suddenly wealthy ex-G . I . down to a science . We feel his emotions of joy , frustration and comic desires .
421171	2542703	41373	9.0	Flamingo Road - Upper Society vs . Joan Crawford	A fabulous Joan Crawford vehicle reuniting her with Zachary Scott of " Mildred Pierce " fame . Again , Scott eventually takes a bullet , but this time it's by his own doing . The film came 4 years after " Pierce " and Crawford looks a lot older here , probably because of her lighter hair . The film is a good one involving upper vs . lower class and dirty , corrupt politics in the name of one Sydney Greenstreet , who is just wonderful here . ( I don't know what the other writers wanted with his performance . ) He is the embodiment of the big city corrupt official who will destroy anyone in his path . He thinks he is self-righteous yet and his name of Titus is most appropriate for him . As the carnival girl , trying to build a life for herself , Crawford etched another memorable performance . She is at her best when she lifts herself up from adversity . Scott is wonderful in the role of the guy , pushed up in politics and thrown into a political marriage with disaster resulting . David Brian has his moments as the other shady official who Crawford also falls for . Get yourself to Flamingo Road !
421648	2542703	60420	9.0	Follow Me Boys Tribute to the Boy Scouts	Wonderful Fred MacMurray fanfare dealing with a man who settles in a small rural town in 1930 and in order to impress Vi , ( Vera Miles ) he embarks on a career as the scoutmaster of the town . Little does he know that this will become a lifetime position for him as he guides countless numbers of boys to maturity through 20 years of scouting . The film is an excellent tribute to the Boy Scouts of America . Vera Miles plays the girl he eventually marries . The film deals with the trials and tribulations that he has deal with during his 20 years of work . Lillian Gish is in fine form as Aunt Hetty , who seems to be senile but is anything but . Elliott Reid , her nephew , comes off as the villain here , partly because he had lost Miles to Lem ( MacMurray ) years before . Kurt Russell is absolutely terrific as a difficult youngster who loves his alcoholic father but is embarrassed by him . Russell goes to live with Lem and Vi when the father dies . Heartwarming and poignant , this is really Americana at its best .
421552	2542703	43175	9.0	Amos N Andy - Done in By Political Correctness	Outstanding television series originally from radio . It dealt with life among black people . Though the show was an instant hit , it came at the time of the rising influence of the NAACP and other civil rights groups of the early 1950s . Through successful efforts of threatening advertisers with boycotts , the show was suddenly taken off the air . How come we never heard such protests in the early 1970s with " All in the Family ? " Certainly that show may have offended other groups but it was done in fun as was " Amos . " With characters such as the Kingfish , Andy Brown , Lightnin ' and Sapphire with her mother , a memorable cast of great black acting talent was shown . Unfortunately , none of these talented thespians went anywhere after the show went off . I hate to use the pun , but were they blacklisted ? Yes , Kingfish was lazy and shiftless and he did try to fool Andy Brown with some of his outrageous schemes . Yes , Sapphire was a wife with a temper and her mother was memorable as well . How many groups can also boast having mothers-in-law like what the Kingfish endured ? Plenty .
421066	2542703	100352	9.0	Case of Silenced Singer Brings Added Surprises	Another very good Perry Mason film where a singer , with a changing personality , is murdered and her second husband is arrested for this . As always , Perry uncovers a slew of others who could have done the victim in . You know that something is really amiss when of all people , Alice Ghostley , is killed by the killer as she same him at the scene where he didn't want people to know that he had been there . Other potential suspects include the woman's first husband , and two female friends . The ending , as always , is a real shocker . You'll almost feel empathy for the killer until you realize that he or she tried to blame the first husband out of revenge for his previous affair . As the singer , Vanessa Williams sparkles . Her singing , in flashbacks , is absolutely sparkling . Wonder if she did her own singing .
420899	2542703	43014	9.0	Sun Never Sets on this Boulevard	Billy Wilder's memorable dramatic film , " Sunset Boulevard , " was made in 1950 . The lead role of Norma Desmond , a washed-up actress , had first been offered to actresses Pola Negri and Norma Shearer before landing in the capable hands of Gloria Swanson . This film heralded the return to the screen by Miss Swanson after many years . It was well worth the wait . Swanson , as Desmond , evokes fear and emotion-complex but yet believable to the audience . A has been actress , who dreams of a comeback , she is mystified by the appearance of William Holden , an apparent gigolo , who made a wrong turn with his car and entered the Desmond world . Norma is needy and emotionally ill . Her butler , played by the excellent Erich Von Stroheim , admits to Holden , that he had been married to Desmond years before . Though the marriage had faltered , he remained to tend to her needs . He even sends her cards with the names of her adoring public-in reality long since gone . Like a magnet , Desmond is attracted and immediately attached to the Holden character . When he ultimately attempts to leave her , she shoots him dead and acts as if this was part of a scene in one of her films . Completely off by film's end , she tells Cecil B . De Mille that she is ready for her take . Be ready for a tale of misfortune , of great acting performances and an attempt to understand the human psyche .
421254	2542703	37884	9.0	The Lost Weekend - Weekend Worth Remembering	Memorable Ray Milland film where he showed Hollywood that he could really act . After playing numerous cads and other Hollywood types , in 1945 Milland gave a well deserved Oscared performance as a writer who is a hopeless drunk . In conveying what a drunk goes through during binge drinking , Milland fully captured the aspects of alcoholism and was honored by Hollywood's highest acting award . The film also gave Jane Wyman an opportunity to break through from her usual silly inane parts up until this film . As the long suffering but dedicated girl friend , Wyman showed that she could handle problem parts adeptly . New York of the 1940s is also well shown . Director Wilder handled details brilliantly here depicting the pawn shops and other stores that are closed on Yom Kippur , the Jewish Day of Atonement . Milland's scenes of delirium and utter despair are memorably shown . He is able to bring us , in a vivid portrayal , what alcoholics go through . His performance showed that alcoholism is a disease . This break through film of 1945 is memorable in that Wilder took on the problem of alcohol addiction . The film would serve as a trail blazer for " Smash Up : The Story of A Woman , " and " I'll Cry Tomorrow . "
420525	2542703	42767	9.0	My Blue Heaven - Almost A Penny Serenade Musical	Wonderful Bette Grable and Dan Dailey fanfare dealing with a musical couple's hard luck in having their own child . They are forced to resort to adoption when a traffic accident causes the loss of her unborn child . We then see unscrupulous adoption procedures and other mayhem preventing this couple from having a child of their own . The couple do a routine on television and Dailey along with Grable show they could still sing and dance at their best . In a brief role , Mitzi Gaynor , who would play Daley's daughter 4 years later in " There's No Business Like Showbusiness , " turns up as a fellow dancer who is ready to flirt and take Daley away from Gable . The wonderful is ending but we expected that . In such film predicaments , they usually do just that .
421452	2542703	67314	9.0	Kotch is Top Notch	What a wonderful movie . For a change , Walter Matthau plays a sympathetic rather than a cantankerous character . He is just wonderful here in his Oscar nominated performance . What makes the movie so good is that it doesn't really stress the attempt of his son and daughter-in-law to put him in a home and then show the misery of homes . Rather , it deals with the coming of life anew for Matthau when he takes a profound interest in the very pregnant babysitter for his grandson . What an interesting idea and it is so well developed . Deborah Winters gives a fantastic supporting performance as the pregnant girl , orphaned , raised by an uncaring brother who finds meaning in her life when she aided by Kotch . There is a totally winning song dealing with what you do with your life . This film was definitely an under-rated gem . Too bad .
421438	2542703	74958	9.0	" Network " Great View on Screen 12	" I'm mad and I'm not going to take it anymore , " yells anchorman Howard Beale . Marvelously played by Peter Finch , Beale etched an unforgettable movie character . It was certainly a sad scene when Finch was posthumously awarded the best actor Oscar for his portrayal of a very frustrated anchorman . As a news honcho hot-shot lady , Faye Dunaway merited an Oscar for best actress . As a network executive , William Holden had to settle for a best actor nomination . Yet , his movie wife , Beatrice Straight , was the surprise winner of the best supporting actress award . Remember her outburst when he told her that he was leaving her ? You'd have to remember because that was one of her two scenes in this film , but she made the most out of it . " Network " is one of the few movies where 5 acting Oscar nominations occurred . As mentioned before , we had Finch , Holden , Dunaway and Straight nominated . Ned Beatty would join them with a supporting nomination . Great film for the news hounds .
421044	2542703	824747	9.0	Changeling - Strong 1920s LAPD Corruption Setting	Lengthy but worthwhile Clint Eastwood film dealing with police corruption in Los Angeles in the late 1920s . Angelina Jolie gives a worthy performance as the mother of a kidnapped boy , victimized by the police when she refuses to accept the child they find and claim is hers as her own son . This shows and leads to a massive cover-up of the LAPD . When the police chief commits Mrs . Collins ( Jolie ) to an asylum for refusing to play ball with them , we see the corruption not only of the police department but the asylums of Los Angeles during this period . I thought that I was going back to Olivia De Havilland's " The Snake Pit " in 1948 . The film is well directed as usual by Clint Eastwood . Great how she shows the simultaneous trials of the man accused of killing the son of Mrs . Collins while the LAPD heads are tried for what they did to Mrs . Collins . Getting through that asylum was almost like " One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest . " The main problem with the film is that it is too long . It could have ended at least 20 minutes to one half hour before .
421531	2542703	1269560	9.0	Love Takes Wing-Only Angels Have Them	This is a wonderful , endearing film which appears to be the beginning of a series on Hallmark network . While it resembles the former Dr . Quinn Medicine Woman television show of years back , we need more of this quality , heartwarming tales . Two female doctors venture forth to the west , this time Missouri . In a rural area , they encounter a cholera epidemic as well as the usual superstitions , prejudice and viciousness of a town in believing that the orphans caused the outbreak . 82 year old Cloris Leachman is just wonderful as a dedicated woman working in the orphanage . There is also fine acting by Patrick Duffy as the conflicted mayor of the town and by director Lou Diamond Philips , who also plays a heavy in the film . One doctor soon finds a male interest and by the end of the show , they wed . Of course , just like Dr . Quinn , they adopt Lillian , a precocious youngster caught up in the epidemic , who acts like a young Florence Nightingale . Looking forward to the continuation of this Love series .
420860	2542703	80948	9.0	The Jazz Singer-When Accommodations Were Made	Wonderful version of a cantor's son in conflict over his orthodox Jewish beliefs and his desire to be a singing star . The only major flaw that I had with this film is that by the orthodox Jewish people , there is no accommodation made whatsoever in the field of intermarriage . If it occurs , the person intermarrying is regarded as dead as depicted in the film . Caitlin Adams , who portrayed Jesse's wife Rivka , is true to life since she chose to break with her husband due to her orthodox beliefs . Others might argue that their marriage was headed towards a downward spiral anyway . Laurence Olivier is absolutely mesmerizing as Diamond's father . His authentic Jewish accent and tearing his clothes are memorable . Diamond's voice is superb and is acting is on par for the role . " Love on the Rocks , " as well as " Acapulco , " and " Coming to America " are wonderfully staged . In the world of today , we need understanding and accommodation and that's exactly what we get in this fine film .
421368	2542703	116731	10.0	Plenty to Deliberate Here in Taut Thriller	Terrific . Exciting thriller about a woman on jury duty who is threatened by the mob to make sure that the jury votes for acquittal . Demi Moore is the juror with conviction , that is to save her young son who is threatened . Alec Baldwin is the psychotic killer who will go to any length to make sure that Moore tows the line . He even kills her friend , Ann Heche , a doctor . Tony Lo Bianco is the head of the mob syndicate who fears Moore even after he is acquitted of all charges . An exciting ending for this gripping film . Moore becomes Rambo-like in the end and it's well justified .
420773	2542703	61240	10.0	I'm So Glad We Had this Time Together	This show was an amazing hit due to the fine comedic talents of Carol Burnett and a terrific supporting cast of Tim Conway , Vicki Lawrence , Harvey Korman and Lyle Waggoner . Those sketches of Burnett will be forever etched in the minds of television viewers . Who can forget Mrs . Wiggins or Nora Desmond , the latter a take off on the brilliant performance of Gloria Swanson as Norma Desmond in 1950's " Sunset Boulevard ? " Swanson , at one time , guest starred on the Burnett show and stated that she never realized that Norma Desmond was such a comical rather than tragic figure . I'm so glad we had this time together .
420699	2542703	32676	10.0	An American for All Ages-Knute Shines	Pat O'Brien had his best role ever as Notre Dame football coach Knute Rockne . From humble beginnings , Rockne entered Notre Dame as a student circa 1910 . He is into chemistry but becomes a marvelous football player and hero . Upon graduation , he teaches chemistry at the school but he has got the football fever that tugs at him , this forces him to give up chemistry to pursue his dream of coaching the game . In a way , too bad , the school probably lost a great chemistry teacher-certainly far better and nicer than the one I had in high school . ( Erasmus Hall in Brooklyn to be exact . ) He motivates his students . He will not tolerate academic underachievement . He is a coach for all seasons . O'Brien captures that common kind touch . One of his students , George Gipp , is memorably played in a fine brief supporting performance by Ronald Reagan . The years pass and the achievements run high-but Knute remains the same kind coach who testifies before Congress when football is called into question . Donald Crisp is outstanding as a Notre Dame priest who knew that Rockne was destined to coach football . Albert Basserman is adequate , but his Jewish accent in the portrayal of a priest is awkward at best . Basserman was nominated that year in the supporting category for " Foreign Correspondent . " Rockne's tragic death , in a plane crash , robbed the world of many more years of a totally professionally wonderful human-being . The film is great .
420952	2542703	365247	10.0	Sinatra : You Will Be My Music-What Class	Highest rating to this Frank Sinatra special . Frank was 57 when he made this show in 1973 . Guest star was his often movie co-star , Gene Kelly , who at 61 , could still hoof it when it came to dancing . His display of it with Sinatra were great . Sinatra came out of retirement to do this show . After viewing it , you have to wonder why he retired to begin with . He first sings " You Will Be My Music " which essentially becomes the theme of the show . Frank was never better when it came to one liners explaining that a telephone operator didn't know who he was , couldn't spell his name and hung up on him when he sang . His rendition of Send in the Clowns was phenomenal . Nice to have seen Lucille Ball and Sammy Davis Jr . in the audience cheering The Chairman of the Board on . They had plenty to cheer about .
421162	2542703	918927	10.0	No Doubt About It . A Great Film	Father Flynn , in a sermon , states that doubt creates a bond . How right he is . This is a knockout film , one for the ages as Meryl Streep , Philip Seymour Hoffman and Amy Adams turn in monumental performances . Viola Davis , in a one scene stealer , is also quite effective here . What really went on in Father Flynn's office ? That remains to be seen . Streep , who was never better , and who has the ability to assume those great accents , takes on an authentic N . Y . one . In many scenes she sounds like the late Connie Gilchrist , a wonderful character supporting actress of the 1930s and 1940s . Streep pulls absolutely no punches as the stern , old-fashioned parochial principal of the 1950s . Bitter by the fact that she lost her husband in World War 11 and afraid to accept a changing American culture , she hides behind all this and is absolutely a brutal principal and person to deal with . She is the very old-fashioned principal who many a teacher suffered under . She goes after Father Flynn after a student allegedly drinks wine from a holy ceremony . Hoffman was made for the role of Father Flynn in the same priestly way as Bing Crosby and Barry Fitzgerald earned their angelic wings in " Going My Way . " He will certainly come into conflict with Sister Aloysius ( Streep ) as he wants change and understanding . Amy Adams stars as the shy , nerd-like nun who catches Father Flynn in a questionable scene and immediately reports back to Sister Aloysius . There are flaming scenes here between Sister and the boy's mother . The latter is played by Viola Davis , who seems to be the prototype for blacks in society circa 1964 when the film takes place . She doesn't want to rock the boat , she fears her husband and her son will be graduating in June . This is definitely a contemporary film as it alludes to priest misconduct in recent and past years .
421001	2542703	54535	10.0	" Dr . Kildare " When Doctors Still Made House Calls	Truly outstanding television series with Richard Chamberlain and Raymond Massey in the lead roles . This was based on the motion picture with Lew Ayres , a conscientious objector during World War 11 and Lionel Barrymore . Each week we were treated to new episodes . The show depicted that doctors are real people as well with emotional feelings . I remember how each show would start off and then there would be that gorgeous music played . I can still hum it like it was yesterday , and we're talking about 45 years ! One of my favorite episodes was when a retarded man ( Sorrell Booke ) came into the emergency room with his brother . Both were of the Orthodox faith and after careful testing , it was revealed that the brother was terminal . When Booke was told of this by Kildare , the latter told him to be a mensch . ( Person ) Raymond Massey was excellent as Kildare's mentor . Too bad that as a lead doctor , he was continuously smoking on the show . Chamberlain , as we all know , went on to become the king of the mini-series .
420999	2542703	85101	10.0	The Thorn Birds - The Church Wouldn't Be Happy With this Masterpiece	Wow ! Best describes this brilliant film . No wonder Richard Chamberlain was known as the king of mini-series . He etched one unforgettable character after another . This time , he is Father Ralph Di Bricissart , who is loved by the town's wealthy Mary Carson . Barbara Stanwyck turned in a brilliant performance as Miss Carson . Her love for Father Ralph had no bounds . When he spurned her , she decided to fix him but good , even if it meant hurting her own family . That's exactly what she did by leaving her fortune to Father Ralph , thereby creating an embarrassing situation for him as well as the church . That being resolved , years pass and we are now finding out that a niece of Carson is romantically involved with Father Ralph . Dane is the result . The Australian outback is beautifully realized here . Jean Simmons , as the sister-in-law of Mary Carson is wonderful as well as the gentleman who portrayed her husband . A story of heartbreak and of the human spirit , " The Thorn Birds " is well recommended .
420900	2542703	39628	10.0	Great Film Fun Highlights Good Values Film	" Miracle on 34th Street " is a heart-warming tale of the spirit of the season-Christmas and other holidays too . Edmund Gwenn deserved his best supporting actor Oscar for his role of Kris Kringle , who had to go to court to justify and prove his very existence . Maureen O'Hara and the late John Payne shine as a couple brought together during this Holiday fanfare . O'Hara's daughter , played by an adorable Natalie Wood , is terrific as the little girl caught up in this holiday madness . The idea of cooperation of Macys and another department store to guide customers is one of the true holiday spirit . A wonderful film depicting American holiday tradition . It only lost the best picture of the year award as the memorable " Gentleman's Agreement " invoked an aura of much needed toleration following the Holocaust period among the socially conscious .
421519	2542703	32138	10.0	We're Off to See the Wizard-Go , Go , Go	. . . And to think , L . Frank Baum , the author of this classic , never lived to get the accolades that he deserved for writing such a masterpiece . The book was found by relatives go through his belongings following his death . To think , Shirley Temple couldn't get out of her contract to go to MGM . As a result , we got Judy as Dorothy . What a voice ! Singing Over the Rainbow , naturally , the best song of the year . To think , that Buddy Ebsen was allergic to his costume and had to bow out of the project . To think , Gale Sondergaard , having won an Oscar 3 years before , thought that the wicked witch part was beneath . Thanks Ms . Sondergaard . You made the biggest mistake of your illustrious career . As a result , we got Margaret Hamilton and the rest is history . To think that W . C . Fields and Mae West were first considered for the roles of the Wizard and Glinda . What comedy we would have had , but much less of a movie as a result . The film is super outstanding . It is primarily for children but adults can certainly learn regarding the human frailties . Poor Dorothy , caught in that Kansas tornado with Toto too ! Injured , she falls into a memorable dream and is transported to the land of Oz , filled with adventure and memories to last for a lifetime . A film to challenge our hearts and dare to dream your dreams that will come true . Some day I'll wish upon a star and wake up where the clouds are far behind me . Isn't it great to escape into a world of fantasy ? Trouble should only melt like lemon drops upon all , not only chimney tops . Why can't I fly beyond the rainbow ? See the film and get caught up in those magical moments .
420377	2542703	45409	10.0	Loretta Young - " Thank You John "	In 1953 Loretta Young left films and ventured to television . Remember how she would come out on the screen in elegant gowns ? She would thank John , the man who introduced her . This television series was an anthology . Loretta tackled a different role each week . Most of the shows were dramas but Ms . Young had the ability to do comedy as well . She really did some fine acting here . I vividly remember the show where she played a woman dying of a brain tumor . I'll never forget when she met the priest by the gate and said that she wasn't Catholic but was dying . How about the one where the principal of a school visits her home at the end of summer vacation . She is the typical spinster teacher here . The principal tells her of his archaeological adventures that summer . When she comes back from making him tea in the kitchen , she discovers him dead . The whole town engages in vicious gossip on what must have been going on between the 2 . I'll also not forget when Walter Slezak appeared as Emil Kronstadt , a chemistry or physics teacher who told a child not to wear falsies . Still another memorable episode was where Loretta comforted her next door neighbor when the latter lost his wife in a hit and run accident . The opening music to the show was marvelous as Loretta waltzed in . She gave us some wonderful memories !
420881	2542703	47528	10.0	La Strada A Road to Pure Excellence	Memorable super outstanding film of a strongman's cruelty towards a woman that he has purchased . Anthony Quinn gives a memorable brilliant performance as the Zampano , the strongman . He shows animal-like instincts rarely seen on the screen . Giulietta Masina's performance as the simpleton is picture-perfect . She utterly evokes sympathy as a simpleton beyond belief . She may be simple but she is tragically looking for love to a strongman who thinks of it as nothing to hurt her in any way that he can . Richard Basehart , in an engaging performance , plays the fool of the circus . Yet , is he really this ? The sadness seen on Masina's face is unbelievable . She cries out for compassion and for survival which fate has decided shall not be hers . Scenes of the tormented Quinn are beyond the realm of human understanding . When he returns after a year's absence only to learn of Masina's fate , he is wrought with destruction as a totally broken man . In 1954 the Motion Picture Academy would not allow actors in foreign films to be nominated in Acting categories . Had this been permitted , both Quinn and Masina would have certainly won Oscars . The film established Federica Fellini , Masina's husband , as a master director . A totally powerful film-never to be forgotten .
420275	2542703	78565	10.0	This Series Takes No Back Stairs to Anything	Outstanding . Superlative . Out of this world . No other words seem adequate regarding this magnificent series . I am a retired social studies teacher . This series would have been so perfect for my grade 8 history students . It was so rich in history and personal emotions . As far as the Emmy awards go , Backstairs should have tied with Roots for the best mini-series of the season . The acting was outstanding . Robert Vaughn brought the perfect touch to Woodrow Wilson . Whoever thought that the character of Florence Harding , who died in 1924 , under mysterious conditions was so interesting ? Celeste Holm was simply memorable as Mrs . Harding . Eileen Heckart was memorable as Eleanor Roosevelt . Lee Grant brought the perfect touch to Grace Coolidge . Julie Harris set the tone as Nellie Taft . Actresses Olivia Cole and Leslie Uggams , in a totally non-singing role , were just fabulous as the mother and daughter who worked for so many years at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave . This is another Best Years Of Our Lives . We all realize the sacrifices that were made during the extremely informative period of history . We are also shown that the White House was a scene of constant tragedy mixed with a total triumph of the human spirit . We need more series of this quality .
420331	2542703	55100	10.0	A Vip Movie !	Both Rock and Doris are caught up in the VIP madness . Trouble is that no one knows what VIP actually is . You see that Rock made it all up to get Edie Adams off his back . Unfortunately , his " crazy " boss , Tony Randall , doesn't know this and as a result the hilarity begins . Rock Hudson excelled in comedy roles when he would be imitating others so as to fool Doris Day . Remember Rex Stetson in another Rock and Doris film ? As Jerry Webster , the advertising Casanova in this film , Rock gave a totally memorable performance . Doris plays Carol Templeton , a devoted advertising executive who can no longer stand losing accounts to Jerry , since he knows how to wine , dine and bed prospective clients . The dialogue is crisp and riotous at best . Edie Adams as Rebel will make you laugh out loud with a darling southern accent . Jack Kruschen has his moments as the embittered chemist who can be bought . Interesting to note that both Adams and Kruschen appeared together the year before in " The Apartment . " As is the case with this film as well , they weren't in any scenes together . A romp in every sense of the word .
421434	2542703	253474	10.0	The Pianist - Destruction Hits A Memorable Chord	Surprise Oscar winner Adrien Brody is magnificent in Roman Polanski's " The Pianist . " ( It was thought by the experts that Daniel Day Lewis would win the award for " Gangs of New York . " ) Polanski's win was a surprise since the conventional wisdom had Martin Scorsese for " Gangs " winning the directing award as well . This tremendous holocaust film deals with the destruction of a family . The scene where a family had its wheelchair bound member tossed from a window and then shot as they ran was eerie and never to be forgotten . As a marvelous piano player , Brody captured the role with depth and a strong conviction . The scene where the family is placed on a train for their ultimate destiny can and must never be forgotten as well . From that point on , the focus of the picture becomes one of survival as Brody is able to elude the Nazi barbarians . A strong film in the tradition of " Schindler's List . " Surely , a film for humanity .
421633	2542703	1227530	10.0	Living Out Loud-A Song in Her Heart	This is an absolutely outstanding film with Gail O'Grady as a music teacher , who leads the typical American life with her husband and 2 children , until a diagnosis of breast cancer sets all of their lives upside down . What makes this film so good is that it depicts the effects of the illness not only on the mother , but the ramifications to the family . It is a time when O'Grady begins to question her values and is told to go for it with a wonderful friend that she meets at a breast cancer group . It is also a time to reflect on her marriage and some very interesting points as well as sacrifices to be made . This film should serve as an inspiration to all those suffering from the dreaded disease . This is the type of film that Hollywood most desperately needs . O'Grady is phenomenal as she takes you all the way from disbelief , the chemotherapy sessions , the losing of hair and ultimate redemption as well as a new quest in life . She is literally supported by a great cast who are totally caught up in the disruption brought about in their lives . Not only does this film tells us that it's time to smell the roses , we have to get going with our lives and dream that impossible dream .
420647	2542703	31381	10.0	A Wind for All times .	The memorable " Gone With the Wind " captures the south at its time of degradation . Margaret Mitchell's outstanding novel was made into a memorable Oscar winning film in 1939 . Here we have the lovely Katie Scarlett O'Hara who will not allow the catastrophic civil war to wreck her life . We see her go through 3 husbands in record speed , while she still yearns for Ashley Wilkes , married to Melanie . ( Olivia De Havilland ) Despite fierce objections by Miss Mitchell , Leslie Howard was cast as Ashley . It was believed that Mitchell objected to Howard since the late actor was Jewish and she could not see him in that particular role . Whether anti-semitism played a part in her objection was unclear . Hattie McDaniel , was the beloved , sly mammy , whose strong will kept a family going despite one tragedy after another . Both McDaniel and DeHavilland were nominated for best supporting actress ; the former would win . Scarlett loves Ashley but he is taken with Melanie . She marries his brother who dies of measles in the army . Frank , her 2nd husband , dies for her honor . Rhett , the real man of her dreams , becomes husband # 3 . Despite a wonderful life with him and bearing him a child , Scarlett can never stop thinking of her precious Mr . Wilkes . There are fireworks from the actors as well as the great civil war scenes . Atlanta destroyed ; the wounded crying out in agony is memorable . We have carpetbaggers and scalawags ready to ravage an already ravaged south once the war ends . Melanie's death , in childbirth , makes it very convenient for Scarlett . She can now divorce Rhett and have Ashley . Surprise ! ! ! ! Ashley professes never loving Scarlett who runs through the fog back to Rhett . She now realizes that she always loved him . Confusing ? The confusion is worth it thanks to Vivien Leigh's forever memorable performance as Scarlett . She would win a well deserved Oscar . As Rhett walks out on her , Scarlett declares that she will think about how to get him back tomorrow . This is one film to always think about . A way of life gone with the wind is an outstanding tribute to a way of life long gone but whose memories are forever etched in our minds .
421613	2542703	29222	10.0	Maytime is A Wonderful Time	This was by far Jeanette MacDonald's best film when teamed up with Nelson Eddy . An elderly woman , counseling young lovers , thinks back to her tragic love affair during the Napoleonic era . Both Nelson and Eddy are at their usual singing best and for a change , Eddy acts the part . He has often been criticized for poor acting in his other films with the wonderful MacDonald . John Barrymore was literally robbed of a best supporting Oscar nomination for his tyrannical role of a lover and husband of MacDonald . It was his inability to accept that MacDonald had found true love with Eddy that leads to tragedy . Too bad that this wonderful film wasn't in color since the set scenes of the Napoleonic era are beautifully realized .
