421206	2542703	340377	1.0	Take the Express and Get Away Fast	A complete lack of continuity best describes " The Station Agent . " When his friend suddenly dies , a dwarf inherits his home by a train depot . He moves there to be alone only to meet up with 2 fellow losers-a hot dog vendor whose watching the place for his ailing father and a woman ( Patricia Clarkson in a thankless role ) separated from her husband , who lost a son 2 years ago . Pete Dinklage ( the dwarf ) wants to play Greta Garbo as he wants to be left alone . The vendor is desperately seeking friendship . Clarkson eventually takes pills to end it all which is really not that bad an idea considering how bad this movie really is . Finbar , ( the dwarf ) meets a pregnant young girl who is subject to abuse by child's father . Having had it and you can't really blame him , Fin gets drunk at a bar and lays down by a railroad track as the train passes by . Suddenly our hero is talking about trains in front of a class only to be humiliated by a student who asks about his height . Our 3 losers appear at a house talking about getting information about the blimps from a library as the film mercifully ends . This is definitely an amateurish production . It seems as though it's a high school project made by a novice film crew .
421420	2542703	427392	1.0	This " Invasion " Needs to Be Conquered	Who wrote this junk ? Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig star in this mysterious trash dealing with a virus that comes to earth and causes people to be almost monster-like . They become like zombies and then resort to violence to get others to join them . At first there is a nuclear disaster which brings about the epidemic . You come down with the disease by falling asleep and it manifests itself during the rem dreaming period . I would suggest that you risk the virus and fall asleep on this miserable film . The writing is a complete joke . New York is quarantined and Kidman's son and ex-husband run to Baltimore to stay with his mother . The latter looks just like the type you would meet in Borough Park , Brooklyn . Of course , Kidman is in pursuit and she naturally gets into a pharmacy and has a serum from keeping her from sleeping . What hogwash .
420320	2542703	780536	1.0	In Brutal Bruges - Enjoy Belgian Waffles But Not this Stinker	After they make a hit in England , 2 killers flee to Bruges , Belgium where the violence really begins . This picture really makes absolutely no sense and eventually becomes nothing more than a blood bath . When Colin Farrell is ordered to kill a priest a young innocent also takes a bullet and for the rest of the film Collin Farrell begs for redemption for what he has done . An hour into this horrific film , Ralph Fiennes shows up as their boss and orders Ken to kill the Farrell character . We also have a Zeljo Ivanek taking a blank bullet to the eye and revenge and all other sorts of mayhem . Ken takes a plunge off a building and that's really disgusting at best . More shooting , more mayhem and we dare to call this black comedy ?
421203	2542703	116353	1.0	Put out the Fire , Please	Terrible film with Angelina Jolie starting off her career . She comes into a school and goes around unchallenged by a security guard . Walking into a biology class , she sees that the teacher is harassing a student for refusing to cut up a frog . It turns out that the teacher has been doing more than just that to his female students . Jolie , known as Legs , finally jumps the teacher with 4 other girls . They are suspended by Principal Parks . ( Richard Beymer ) Sad to see that Beymer's career has come to this playing a non-understanding principal . The part is gratefully brief . The girls are suspended and come back to the school with Legs since one of them has to retrieve papers . A lit match ignites a fire and the sprinkler system goes on . Even with the arrival of the police , the girls manage to flee to a hidden abandoned house where they dance and act like the brats they are . Of course , there is a stolen car episode and a gun going off and hitting one of the parents . Seems his daughter , Goldie , is on drugs . There is entirely too much going on here . Legs thankfully leaves and Matty is suddenly no longer afraid of heights . The writing is contrived . The ideas are out of inner sanctum . A very poor movie with no way out other than turning it off .
421350	2542703	405325	1.0	Sky High Hits Record Low	You wonder why Kurt Russell would accept anything like this . Playing a Superman-like character , Goldie Hawn's long-time lover , must be super fool . Sky High refers to a high school over the rainbow . The kids go there and there is anything but academics . You prove how cool you are by showing your strength . Our hero has strong parents but he is a nerd who will have to find his way . A girl , who was really quite evil in another life , tries to turn the tables on all at the annual homecoming . When the plot is resolved , the main character has nerve enough to say that the rest of the school year was boring . What did he call this film-enjoyable ?
420820	2542703	365485	1.0	This Matador is Full of Bull	Absolutely terrible film dealing with a burned out assassin ( Julian ) , played by a hard drinking , heavy smoking Pierce Brosnan and his chance meeting with a conventional business person Danny ( Greg Kinnear ) The two become friends as Julian tells Danny that he is burned out . He can get out of this deal by doing one more job-the job we find out is killing his boss ! The gags are ridiculous . This is a very amateurish , inane comedy . Kinnear tells Julian that his son was killed in a school bus accident . Julian changes the subject and that ticks off Danny . The viewers should be ticked off with the rest of this foolishness as well .
421456	2542703	40974	1.0	The Woman in White-Fade to Black Quickly	Miserable film showcasing 2 excellent acting performances . John Emery , as Percival , a nervous wreck is simply marvelous here . He can't take any noise and I wonder how he could have taken any of this miserably crafted and written film . Sydney Greenstreet is so good here because the part of being so sinister was made to order for him . Eleanor Parker has the pleasure of have a dual role here , as one woman , victimized by a fortune hunter and another , dressed in white , who is absolutely off her mind . Speaking of off , Agnes Moorehead looks like a mannequin here . She is totally off the wall and is a perfect foil for " husband " Greenstreet . The writing is simply awful and dull . The film is a period piece taking place in Victorian England of 1851 . The dark , somber mood is befitting here .
421621	2542703	765443	2.0	Eastern Promises - Goes South Rapidly	Remember David Cronenberg's NAKED LUNCH ? I should have known what I'd be in for after viewing this mess of a film . I must hand it to Viggo Mortensen , a fine actor , who comes up with a marvelous Russian accent . Otherwise , the story line is boring . A prostitute dies while emergency surgery is performed to deliver her baby . Turns out that the baby's father and family are Russian mafia living in England . By the way , what are these characters doing in England ? This is never adequately explained . While the end is satisfying , the film is gruesome and highly predictable .
420522	2542703	34273	2.0	That Night in Rio-Chica Boom Bomb !	I wholeheartedly disagree with the other viewers of this wretched film . The only reason why I didn't rate it 1 for awful was due to the great talent of Carmen Miranda . The beginning and end are the best parents due to her gifted singing and dancing . The problem is with the rest of the picture . Alice Faye comes off quite hollow . Don Ameche has a great singing voice but with the wretched writing material , he comes off so terribly corny . The plot is a real stiff here with Ameche assuming two parts as a song and dance man and a baron not happily married to Faye . It seems that by playing the song and dance man , Ameche's marriage gets a second change to reignite . Some silly nonsense about the baron having to clear up business and being away allows him to play both parts . S . Z . Sakal is given little to do here and so his comedic gifts are not given the opportunity to shine . Ditto for J . Carrol Naish who actually appears uncomfortable in his role . This is a chica chica boom bomb of a film .
421292	2542703	42247	2.0	Big Hangover Sleep this One Off	It's hard to believe that just 4 years after this ridiculous film , Johnson and Taylor costarred in the memorable " The Last Time I Saw Paris . " That was a picture . The problem with this film is that the sub-plot would have made the ideal plot . A Chinese doctor is refused admission into his apartment due to racism and bigotry . This would have made for a fascinating problem especially in an era when the movies was searching for relevant social problems of the period . Instead , we are given an inane film where every time Johnson even sips a drink , he goes absolutely bonkers . Come to think of it , this is insulting to people who have drinking problems . Taylor talks in a voice that was appropriate for " National Velvet " but certainly not 6 years later when she was older . Any decent acting here is done by veteran pro Leon Ames , as a city official . His one scene stealer towards the end is memorable .
420986	2542703	185014	3.0	Wonder Boys is Wonderfully Awful	Disintegrating film and real fast despite an excellent fast . The story starts out well as Michael Douglas , a tenured English professor , is teaching his creative writing class . The film soon falls apart due to the miserable writing . Tobey McGuire portrays one of his students who is sullen , an excellent writer , with constant morbid thoughts . Who really cares about the number of Hollywood stars who committed suicide ? Ridiculous . Never get too cozy with your students . McGuire and others are invited to the home of the Chancellor ( Francees McDormand ) and her mousy-like husband , English Chairman Richard Thomas . Go know that Douglas and McDormand are lovers and she is pregnant by him . All mayhem breaks lose when McGuire steals a coat worn by Marilyn Monroe and kills the Chancellor's dog who has attacked the Douglas character . What follows is a weekend of revealing philosophies and torture for the rest of the audience . The ending is somewhat unexpected . Rip Torn shows up as a guest speaker at some sort of weekend symposium . Robert Downey Jr . portrays the editor for Douglas . Ironically , it's Douglas who is hooked on coke and what not . Wouldn't the part have been more appropriate for Downey ? Of course , nothing really would help this film .
420486	2542703	48728	3.0	To Catch A Thief - Don't Bother	This is probably one of Alfred Hitchcock's worst films . He would certainly redeem himself the following year with the classic " North by Northwest . " Other than breathtaking cinematography of the French Riviera , this film really has little to offer . It is said that Cary Grant came out of retirement to make this . Thank the lord that he didn't resume retirement after it . It's basically the story of someone copying the cat burglar techniques of former cat burglar John Robie ( Grant . ) There are chase scenes throughout the Riviera but the film is dull . We really reach the point where we don't care who the guilty party is . As in the fabulous " North by Northwest , " there is an exciting climatic scene but even that fails to realize the emotions needed . Grant gives a fairly good performance but is hampered by the written material . Grace Kelly was still probably with a swell-head for her undeserved Oscar win , the year before , for " The Country Girl . " The part of a rich , snobby , girl in the fast lane was good for her but she fails to capitalize on it . Her mother , Jesse Royce Landis , has some scene stealing scenes . Note that Landis appeared the following year in " North by Northwest " as Grant's mom .
421014	2542703	50438	4.0	Not Likely to Like " The Girl Most Likely "	Disappointing 1957 musical where within an 1 hour and 40 minutes , Jane Powell gets engaged to 3 guys at the same time . The Gauer Champion choreography is its usual greatness . Dancing sequence of " Keeping up with the Joneses " is memorable as well as the scene with all the dancing in Mexico . Powell does nicely in the part but is not convincing in the comedy scenes where she has had one too many . Tommy Noonan is good as her original guy who is an ambitious salesman . Cliff Robertson , who she meets by jumping over-board is young and simple . Keith Andes , as the wealthy guy , looks old for 1957 . Una Merkel , who seemed to fit in nicely in the 1950s in mother roles , is along for the ride . The ending is somewhat of a surprise and proves that wealth isn't everything .
421321	2542703	837119	4.0	Jane Doe-Keep Her Anonymous	Muddled story with stolen art , American Nazis , and an entire host of things included . Despite a stellar cast , the film suffers from constant confusion . Why was that art dealer killed ? Would we actually think that an elderly Holocaust survivor was trying to fool people with the Veneer portrait ? Do we have to be told that villain Philip Casnoff is thrown off the helicopter he flees to ? Since when does a blonde dish have the name of Agnes ? What an art investigator she is ! Lea Thompson directed and starred in this mess as a housewife who goes on student field trips and also doubles as a secret agent . The mixing of the two is hard to believe as well as realize here . Thompson always has that bit of anger on her face when she is acting . I can't blame her here given the material that she has to work with . Joe Penny , as the cop Frank , is taken in by Agnes , Elaine Hendrix , and he looks entirely confused by all this . Nice seeing William R . Moses in the part of Thompson's husband . Remember him in Perry Mason ? I always wondered what became of him . He is given so little to do in this film .
420385	2542703	65400	4.0	The Angel Levine Unsettling and Morally Tragic	I was very disappointed in this 1970 film based on a Bernard Malamud story . This is basically a story of possible redemption , racial bias and the unfulfillment of life based on mistrust . A black Jewish angel is sent to help a struggling tailor and his critically ill wife . If Morris Mishkin ( Zero Mostel ) will only believe in the angel ( Belafonte ) , his wife Fanny ( Ida Kaminska ) will recover . The problem is that Morris has basically given up on life and just refuses to believe that Belafonte is an angel . When he believes it , Fanny improves but in the end he has doubts and Fanny suffers accordingly . It would have been very nice if there had been an English translation in the last scene when a dying Fanny speaks to Morris . Jan Kadar , who successfully directed Miss Kaminska in her Oscar nominated brilliant performance in 1966's " The Shop on Main Street " directs this film as well . Kaminska is reduced in the film to mostly bed scenes and her kindness in her speech really doesn't convey the desperate situation that she faces . She keeps calling for Ruthie , their daughter , who disobeyed them by marrying out of the Jewish religion . For most of the film , she does not realize the Angel's appearance in her apartment . The scene in the pharmacy is muddled and the scene where the Angel's girl friend confronts Belafonte in their apartment , is memorable but all too brief . We don't know why Belafonte is in danger and why he has died . Those viewing this film must have left the theater in a state of depression and desperation .
421047	2542703	70290	4.0	The Last Detail Needs More Specifics	While viewing this inane film , did anyone else besides myself think that how could two guys like Nicholson and his partner be assigned to bring a naval prisoner to jail ? If anything , these 2 guys were the embodiment of no good . You just know that they are going to go on some adventure with this jerk , played admirably by Randy Quaid , who is off to jail for lifting $40 . 00 in church . The big riot is when the gruesome threesome come to the house of ill repute . There Quaid chooses Carol Kane , a prostitute , to be his lady of the hour . Carol Kane a prostitute ? Even Sister Aloysius in Doubt could have done a better job here . Quaid is quiet , soft spoken and yet you know he is ready to break loose . The ending is absolutely no surprise . Bring me some more details , please .
421544	2542703	39556	4.0	The Late George Apley - Film Should Have Departed As Well	In the same year that he won the Academy Award for the great " A Double Life , " Ronald Colman starred in this colossal stuffy bomb about an idealistic Boston family of 1912 . They're a wealthy bunch although the film never tells us where they got their money from . Colman was an outstanding actor and he is able to rise above the boring film and give a splendid performance as a man devoted to his social mores of the time . The problem is that he is about to wreck the lives of his son and daughter by his obstinate ways . In reality , he is nothing more than a snob who quotes Ralph Waldo Emerson to justify his ways . You know that he will eventually come to his senses but you don't care as this film just moves along at a dull pace . As his sister , Mildred Natwick ( Amelia ) has some funny lines but that's about it . You would think that being born in Boston to wealth meant that you remained there for good and acted in an outlandish way . It is only when The Bird Society denies him the presidency , Apley begins to come to his senses . This film is certainly for the birds . This might have worked in 19th century Europe but forget it here .
420735	2542703	39589	4.0	Lured - Don't Be Enticed	Pretty bad film with George Sanders and Lucille Ball starring . Their chemistry is about non-existent . This is supposed to be a murder thriller and for a change there is absolutely no violence shown as 7 women fall victim to a mysterious killer . Charles Coburn is the inspector of Scotland Yard yet he has no British accent . Lucille Ball plays a dancer doing odd jobs who works as a decoy for the Yard when one of her friends mysteriously disappears and eventually shown to fallen victim to this maniacal killer . Ball is essentially Lucy without the laughs . Despite what others say , she shows absolutely no dramatic flare here at all . I expected Ethel and Fred Mertz to intervene at any time to save the day . It becomes so obvious who the killer is . Sir Cedric Hardwicke , who was so good in " The Ten Commandments " and memorable as Henry Cabot Lodge in " Wilson , " looks like a real odd-ball here . The ending is predictable even with Sanders , the lover of Ball , in the film confessing guilt to draw the real killer out .
420589	2542703	33628	4.0	Four Mothers Need More Maturity	Very disappointing film after the wonderful " Four Daughters " made in 1938 . Claude Rains and May Robson do well in their parts as brother and sister . They are given little help but some weak written material . Everyone seems to be investing in Florida land and when a hurricane ravages the land , everyone is wiped out . Rains is forced to sell the family house of 40 + years and move with Robson to a small apartment . The sisters sulk , three of them have become mothers and two have been somewhat unfaithful with the other sister's husband . Everything seems to get conveniently tied in as Rains is called upon to conduct an orchestra playing Beethoven . It's just a little too neat of a package , especially when they find their house intact in another part of the neighborhood . The builder who bought it from them just needed the land . Robson delivers the best lines here .
421007	2542703	29675	4.0	This ' Toast ' Burns On All Corners	Dreadful 1937 film where three con men played by Cary Grant , Jack Oakie and Edward Arnold con their way to success . For them , the worst thing could have been was that the civil war ended . They wind up with a fortune ; that is , a fortune in confederate bonds . While they are worth nothing , the trio manages to parlay this nothing into a fortune . Here is a major flaw in the film . It is never adequately explained how they could get away with this . Sounds more like the junk-bond trade of the 1980s and so . Frances Farmer , as a maid to a chanteuse , is elegantly dressed but does very little else here . Too bad that Miss Farmer spent much of her life combating mental disorders . Starring in this film was a disorder in itself . Arnold has some moments especially when he allows greed to lead to his downfall . However , you didn't have to be a rocket-scientist to see this coming . A very poor script certainly did not help this . Jack Oakie was traditionally a comedian of A-1 quality . How many times was he going to refer to Arnold as Yes Boss , Yes Boss . Slavery ended with the civil war .
421006	2542703	421729	4.0	Big Momma's House - Same Old Laughs	The person who does the make-up for Martin Lawrence deserves the Oscar-hands down . In this sequel , Big Momma again goes undercover , this time as a maid to a family that has little time for its 3 children . Seems that daddy , the typical nice guy , has gotten mixed up with enemy agents . The latter want to steal a disk that shows all secret government items . The laughs are there but the jokes are so old and you can easily predict what is going to happen . Lawrence makes all the right moves and the audience shall certainly laugh with his body-motions . The enemy is so predictable ; the kids are cute but their actions are known to the viewer before the next scene arises . Lawrence pulls out a couple of good laughs . Threatening to call the Rev . Al Sharpton , if he doesn't get the job and parking by a synagogue while claiming that Momma is half-Jewish . The reply of the FBI agent is " Shabbat Shalom . " As was in the original , when the bad guys are caught Lawrence can return again as Big Momma to pull the family situations together . While he does a credible job , the viewer should not be prepared for part 3 .
421017	2542703	40366	4.0	See No Force of Evil	John Garfield in another film noir . Problem with this film is in terms of explanation . Why after so many years of estrangement does Garfield want to bring his older brother , Thomas Gomez , a small time gambler into the big time ? Beatrice Pearson makes her first appearance in a brief career . She sounds like and tries to emulate Grace Kelly . Sorry , it doesn't work . As a poor working girl for Gomez , she always seems to be in the wrong place . The big mobster here is Roy Roberts , who was so memorable in 1947's " Gentleman's Agreement , " as the bigoted innkeeper . 20 years later he would take on a similar role in " Hotel . " Garfield is a Wall Street attorney who works for the crooked Roberts . There's also the bookkeeper who can't keep his mouth shut and takes a bullet for it . The ending music where Garfield searches for his dead brother below the bridge is totally inappropriate .
420663	2542703	171227	5.0	Diplomatic Siege - Needs More than Diplomacy	The film goes awry towards the middle of it . It starts off quite well when the U . S . embassy in Bucharest , Romania is taken hostage by Serbian terrorists . We have the usual threats and intimidation . We have the usual demands but things go way out of control when the person the terrorists are negotiating for is killed by a Croatian and the Americans must come up with a substitute to fool the Serbs . Darryl Hannah's role is quite perplexing . When she turns out to be a villain , she is still adored by film's end . Her role in this was somewhat of an enigma , even though it is explained by the film's end . Naturally , the theme of money being the root of all evil is examined here as well . A very muddled ending does not help the film at all . The special effects are quite good , and there is plenty of screaming by the hostages . Tom Berrenger comes across like a military know-it-all .
421155	2542703	1042877	5.0	Cadillac Records Doesn't Exactly Ride the High Country	The music is fascinating but it's still the same old story in movie land . A group of guys make it big in the record industry in the 1950s and mayhem results . Yes , it's the old story of what success can lead to . Adrien Brody has the lead role of Len Chess , a Jewish guy whose parents came from Poland . The last time we heard Poland mentioned in a movie , Brody won the Oscar for " The Pianist . " Brody certainly needs to have gone to a smoking cessation clinic after this film . This guy can really put those cigarettes away . While I imagine that Len Chess was a heavy smoker , it becomes very disgusting and poignant as Chess died of a massive heart attack at age 37 . There is the usual screaming , violence and killing in this picture as you can imagine . Beyonce Knowles is wonderful as the drug-addicted Etta James . She belts out AT LAST in a phenomenal way .
420534	2542703	32823	5.0	There is Music in My Heart But Not Much Else	Rita Hayworth stars in a film that would have been better served by having Ginger Rogers in it . Rita misses the boat and therefore an opportunity to wed wealthy boyfriend Alan Mowbray who has a contentious butler , played by the usual witty Eric Blore . In a taxi-cab mishap , she meets up with Tony Martin , who is about to be deported . The rest of the film is devoted to hiding Tony out from immigration authorities . George Tobias plays a Russian chef whose major claim to fame was that he was honored by the tsar for his blintzes ! The gags are predictable and we can all guess what the plot shall bring . We needed Tony to be singing more . The film ends with him singing the title song . Hayworth has a one scene fling at dancing which is great but more of this was needed .
421074	2542703	35829	5.0	DuBarry Was A Lady - When the 2 Redheads Collide	Mild fanfare with Red Skelton , Lucille Ball and Gene Kelly in this farce about what's going on at a local nightclub . Lucy is Lucy and Red does his usual nonsense . Kelly tries to play it straight but isn't given the substantial material needed . Zero Mostel , young and chubby looking , is along for the ride as a seer . You may not recognize him here but after all , it's 1943 ! The film begins to take off during Skelton's dream sequence of being transported back to revolutionary France as Louis XV . The costumes of that period along with the singing and dancing of modern music are a joy to watch . While Red , as Louis , has been over-taxing his subjects , he's in for a rude awakening when he gets up . Tax man Donald Meek is there to take away most of the money that he won in the sweepstakes . Much more of Cole Porter's fine music is missing in the film version .

Annie needs a bypass immediately and she wants to send out the ashes on her 50th wedding anniversary . The plot is seemingly ridiculous and White recruits her song-loving granddaughter to accompany her on this cross country trip . The film has shades of Geraldine Page's " The Trip to Bountiful . " Problem is that it isn't half as good . With the kerchief tied around her head , White looks like an elderly Russian babushka ( grandmother . ) If you need a bypass , you don't go running around the country . Take it from me . Richard Thomas plays Annie's son . He has inherited the business and tries to be a work , work , work sort of guy . He is also a widower . The film centers on the adventures of Annie and granddaughter . She affectionately calls her Ella-bear . There is a scene when the two land in jail for trespassing and a nostalgic meeting with Annie's brother . The latter , 20 years younger than Annie , has not seen his sister in nearly 30 years . We've seen so much of this material before handled a lot better .

The town's people of a small Mexican town are so kind and friendly . No one argues . Everyone lives so happily in poverty . The boss is so nice . When a couple's marriage is strained due to the inability to conceive a child , the husband's boss lets him get off from work for a week to use his time-share . Our childless couple wander into a small town caught up in a festival to honor some saint . There's a crippled child there who has been selected to fly around the saint so that a miracle can happen . The child flies , his bad leg is cured . Our childless couple witness this , go home and presto , she is pregnant ! Yes , the story is inspirational as it deals with human relationship and how people can cooperate . Years ago , Frank Sinatra summed it up best when he sang : Fairy tales can come true , they can happen to you , if you're young at heart . This Mary Poppins like fairy-tale can't really work . It's too sugar-coated for anyone's taste .
421381	2542703	40109	5.0	Reteaming of Boyer and Bergman Doesn't Really Work-Arch of Triumph	Even the re-teaming of Ingrid Bergman and Charles Boyer in this 1948 film doesn't help it very much . At least , unlike the 1985 version , Paris is not that lugubrious . While war is about to break out in September , 1939 , Paris is still very much a city of lights , and much is happening in the outdoor cafés . The story is one of an ill-fated affair between a chanteuse and doctor , both refugees from Nazism . Boyer and Bergman are lovers but events and extremely bad timing make for the inevitable tragedy . As always , Charles Laughton is the personification of evil , this time as a Nazi official who loves to visit gay Paris for a variety of reasons , one being to keep check on German citizens who have fled Nazi Germany . The chemistry between Bergman and Boyer is fine , but the story needs to be jazzed up somewhat . It's extremely slow-moving . An interesting performance is given by Louis Calher , as Boris , a friend of Boyer . I loved his line that history doesn't make accommodations . This movie's writing didn't make the necessary accommodations either .
420825	2542703	411061	5.0	88 Minutes Might Really Be A Class Act	It isn't as bas as some people are saying . It's not an Oscar winner but Slumdog Millionaire wasn't either . Al Pacino , as always , delivers a good performance , this time as a forensic psychiatrist caught up in murder and forced to relive the brutal slaying of his younger sister years before . The title has something to do with that . Nice seeing William Forsythe playing a nice guy for a change , that is , on the right side of the law . You have to see the film to understand why I bring in class act into the mix . The premise is not that outrageous . After all , what some of these lawyers wouldn't do ! As is the usual case with this type of film , the bodies begin to pile up and we have lots of turns and twists where even Pacino is suspected of causing all the mayhem . Takes place in a rainy Seattle . What else is new ?
421468	2542703	388500	6.0	Beauty Shop Provides Thin Cut	Queen Latifah opens a beauty shop after her big argument with her boss . Latifah is kind , intelligent but just plain out of luck . Kevin Bacon steals the film in his role as the gay boss with a thick German accent . Wearing his blond wig , Bacon is hilarious in a performance that should have been considered for best supporting actor . The women and man hairstylist have a comment for everything and everyone but the film just seems to meander about . The writers should have remained focused on Latifah's relationship with the evil Bacon , who conspires with the State Board to ruin her after she takes business away from him . An aging Della Reese has a wasted one scene role as a high class woman entering the shop . Miss Reese was offered few lines and disappears rapidly . Alfre Woodard , as one of the stylists , is effective in her common talk but no nonsense approach .

Naturally , as a comedian , he is confused with a spy and is made to serve his country to act like the former to obtain information . We get the usual Hope shtick here . " I have no friends in Washington . I vote Republican . " You don't have to be a rocket scientist to realize that the real spy escapes and soon is on Hope's trail as well . Hedy Lamarr tries to be funny but really can't . She is the thrown-over ex-girl friend of the spy Hope who soon realizes that the joker Hope can't really be her true flame . The ending is funny . We see the two on the lam riding on a fire truck . Some funny lines here , almost as funny as Hope fleeing with Jane Russell and saying to an animal , " Thanks for the ride . " " Thanks for the memories Bob , " you did a lot better than this .
421484	2542703	1182887	6.0	Flirting With 40 - It's Still the Same Old Story	The older woman with a younger guy syndrome . Of course , when her husband falls for a younger girl , this is perfectly all right . This seems to be the norm in society . While on vacation , Jackie , ( Locklear ) falls for a younger guy , a surf instructor . Her friends back at home try to dissuade her from such a relationship . Even her former husband , who is living with a younger girl , has his criticisms as well . There are 2 children involved . When you think of it , this is really an updated version of 1955's " All that Heaven Allows , " with Jane Wyman and Rock Hudson . Of course , that was far superior because of the likes of Janie and Rock and the marvelous supporting cast of Jacqueline de Wit , the town's vicious gossip and Wyman friend , Agnes Moorehead . A lot of these films have the same common denominator . While there shall be an understanding at the end , the husband loses his new girlfriend .
420315	2542703	420818	6.0	Out of the Woods and Into Oblivion We Go	Does Larry Levenson of Hallmark just enjoy creating the same theme where people visit older folks and redeem themselves before the latter pass on ? We see this theme over and over in many of Levenson's productions and " Out of the Woods " is no different . When a grandson , an attorney , is sent to deliver legal papers to his grandfather , who has moved to the woods , the former gets much more than he ever bargained for . This is basically a story of getting away from the rat race and a return to nature . While a good movie , it is cliché . The movie goes downhill when Asner is revealed to be suffering from a terminal illness . He does go gently into that good night by going off into the forests . Of course , the film brings out the grandson's redeeming qualities and that he can do better than the girlfriend he has been seeing within the L . A . scene .
420582	2542703	50212	6.0	Bridged too Far	This Oscar winning film of 1957 , " The Bridge on the River Kwai , " is a little too heavy handed . One of the prisoners has it right , " won't building this bridge be seen as an act of treason ? " Captured by the Japanese , Col . Nicholson and his men agree to build such a bridge . They put a tremendous effort into it . At no time is there ever a discussion of trying to escape . What would John Wayne have done ? Nicholson's lame excuse is that in years to come people will thank the English for building the bridge . He anticipates a world at peace with respect and toleration for all cultures . Baloney . You're at war , Mr . Nicholson . At the end , Nicholson cries out in regret , " What have I done ! , " as he collapses and destroys the bridge . What was the writer really thinking . As always , William Holden is effective , this time as an ant-war hero caught up in this predicament . Jack Hawkins acts in his usual bombastic overbearing way . The cinematography is beautiful but the story itself is far from the realm of reality . War is war .
421126	2542703	37588	6.0	The Cheaters-Cheat Movie Goers	Joseph Schildkraut in a Christmas film . I can't seem to think where his character as a washed-out actor belongs . In some scenes he looks totally out of his mind and in others he tries to instill good virtues in this hum-drum picture . The youngest daughter of Eugene Palette and Billie Burke is a real brat . She acts like a real princess and by the next scene , she is in the holiday spirit flapping pancakes . Then , we have that annoying voice of Billie Burke . That voice was great to say Toto too in " The Wizard of Oz , " or even as the wealthy dowager in " The Young Philadelphians , " where Burke gave the best performance of her career . Not in this film , as she portrays a woman as part of a family trying to deny a total stranger her inheritance . Her voice is annoying and she finally remembers when her sonny finally says mom to her after so many years . What nonsense . Ona Munson , Belle Wattling in the great " Gone With the Wind , " is the woman they're all trying to fool here . I must say that Munson , who committed suicide in 1951 , is good in this film as well . She is sympathetic and kind as the woman looking for holiday ties . Schildkraut , who appears as the embodiment of evil in the film , suddenly comes to his senses and tries to revert back to the Christmas Carol in attempting to get the wayward family to mend their ways . Any viewer who can compare this tripe with the memorable " It's A Wonderful Life , " must be on another planet .
420357	2542703	434139	6.0	Last Kiss - Peyton Place in Wisconsin ?	. . . And I actually thought that the television series " Picket Fences " showed plenty of what was going on in Wisconsin . This film primarily deals with commitments or really the lack of . It is about immaturity and problems among older and younger couples . That's the problem here . Too much is trying to be shown . Nonetheless director Tony Goldwyn should be applauded here for an admirable job and getting top performances by veterans Blythe Danner and former Oscar nominee Tom Wilkinson ( In the Bedroom ) . As the frustrated 30 year wife , this is Danner's best part and performance in years . She pulls out every emotional stop as a woman whose married to a psychiatrist ( Wilkinson ) has been failing for years . Wilkinson is a brooding figure who finally speaks out when his pregnant daughter's fiancé has cheated on her . The story is also about friends of the young couple . One disenchanted guy whose affair has ended and has decided to leave on a whirlwind trip with a fellow pal , a 29 year old bartender . Casey Affleck and his wife can't stop arguing while they undergo the pains of trying to rear a baby . The film really centers around Zach Braff and his relationship with Barrett . Who are Barrett's parents to give advice after it is revealed that their marriage is on the rocks ? The film had the potential to be a good one but it tries to convey too much . Too much immaturity and lack of commitment here . The ending scenes of sitting out in the rain to get his girl back are sometimes laughable at best .
421131	2542703	45566	6.0	A Blueprint for Murders " Peters " Out	Interesting film soon falls flat . Joseph Cotten , a reserved heavy smoking businessman , shows up just in time when his young niece dies suddenly in the hospital . Joe's brother and sister-in-law are already gone , and before his death , the brother had remarried the lovely Jean Peters . A young nephew survives . What seems to be a routine tragedy soon develops into murder by poisoning . When it becomes obvious that Peters has killed her step-daughter , Cotten and others must prove it and at the same time protect the young nephew from the conniving killer . The film falls flat once Cotten follows Peters and the young nephew on to a boat where she is taking the young lad to see Europe and probably come to his death . Cotten's scheme is to kill his sister-in-law before she kills the little boy . Far-fetched but not out of the realm of a world gone crazy is the plot to this film . The entire problem here is that it's almost impossible for anyone to pin the murder on Peters . It appears that after supposedly poisoning Miss Peters at the end , Cotten seems to have gone awry . The poison doesn't seem to be working proving that those aspirins with the w on them weren't poison after all . . . . But were they ?
421219	2542703	395251	6.0	Shock , Schlock Mar Bialystock & Company	An early song in this Mel Brooks romp describing shock , schlock of Max Bialystock really describes the problems in this offensive movie . Yes , offensive it is to all groups . Singing about Hitler and Germany is most obnoxious . Could you imagine Holocaust survivors sitting through this ? Unlike the original film , the song of " Springtime for Hitler " is lengthy and downright insensitive . Nathan Lane reprises the role originally done by the late Zero Mostel . He is engaging but lacks the emotional nerve needed for the role of this conniving human being . Matthew Broderick is Leo Blum , the bookkeeper originally played by Gene Wilder in the film . Broderick's performance is lacking . Though he sings well , his emotional outbursts lack the zany insanity of the Oscar nominated Wilder . There are some added songs and Will Ferrell as the author of " Springtime " is engaging but does not tackle the role as Kenneth Mars did in the original . Perhaps another flop could have made such as a nonsensical musical of Julius Caesar . Dancing to the Ides of March might have yet been hilarious !
421011	2542703	443543	6.0	The Illusionist Deals With A Vanishing Love	Edward Norton is in top form as a magician who loves the woman engaged to the prince of the Austria-Hungary before World War 1 . The two know each other from childhood but were separated due to her family . Leopold is a vicious character who plots to overthrow his father and marry Duchess Sophie . Norton reenters the scene as the Illusionist Eisenheimer and draws much attention as he shows his magical gifts . The fun really starts when Leopold kills Sophie after she tells him that she is leaving him . Paul Giamatti is the police inspector , a role that Charles Laughton would have had a field day with in his time . The film is engrossing and when Giamatti realizes what has occurred , the picture ends on a positive note . Love will keep us together .
421150	2542703	53716	6.0	Cinderfella	The old story told with a twist . The sexes are reversed in this one . This time it's Jerry Lewis victimized by a wicked stepmother and her 2 hoodlum sons . Who else but Ed Wynn could play a fairy godfather ? Dame Judith Anderson , a veteran player of the wicked , is at it again but how can we expect this great lady to add comedy to spice up her performance . She needed to do her part with a comic twist as Jo Van Fleet did in the television version of " Cinderella . " Sadly , that's missing . Playing the role straight is of no consequences in this farce . The sons come off like underworld hoods . It's a little too heavy for this film . Jerry is funny but his attempts at singing fall quite flat . Nice to show the kiddies that guys can be victimized too .
421460	2542703	33028	7.0	Dovish on this Hawk	This film was not nearly as good as 1938's Errol Flynn classic - " Robin Hood . " As in the case with " The Sea Hawks , " this film also starred Claude Rains , Una O'Connor and Alan Hale . Rains , brilliant in ' Hood , ' was not given the lines here . While he is again cast in a villain role , he is not given the opportunity to exert evil . O'Connor , who could be counted on to give great comical lines , is muted in this film . Hale is unable to deliver as well . " The Sea Hawks " should be noted for an excellent supporting performance by Flora Robson as Queen Elizabeth . She acts in a majestic style . The film dealing with English piracy , and the Spanish Armada is really dull at best . The escape from slavery was exciting but the picture is about done by then . Brenda Marshall is an engaging leading lady but her part was small and the depth of her acting is not viewed until the end .
420542	2542703	57090	7.0	Gather Your Rosebuds-Human Element Shines	Forget the technical aspects of explaining what the function of these fliers are . It was a tedious explanation at the beginning of the flick and was as confusing as Price Waterhouse's explanation of voting procedures at the Oscars each year and as boring and difficult as Ethel Weintraub's chemistry class at Erasmus Hall H . S . in Brooklyn . The film begins to take shape when it discusses the human element . Rock Hudson portrays a hard driven commander who pushes his men to the limit so as to prepare our people in aviation for a war emergency . In the process of doing this , Hudson ruins the life of veteran Barry Sullivan . The former feels that Sullivan can no longer cope with the difficulty of the job and forces him into retirement . This retirement causes Sullivan's son to leave Stanford and the Sullivan character placing a bullet in his body in a suicide attempt . Rock , as Col . Caldwell , ameliorates the situation by visiting Sullivan in the hospital and gets him to say that he will strive for excellence in his new position in civilian life . Hudson also tries to get rid of Rod Taylor as he believes that the latter has become too chummy with the men . It is while Hudson is visiting Sullivan at the hospital that a simulated emergency occurs which tests the strengths of all . Mary Peach plays the British wife of Hudson . Her performance is not peachy-keen . When she first walks off a plane to meet her husband in an early scene , you would think that Queen Elizabeth was playing the part . A good film relating to working with men in a difficult but often unexplained task . Rod Taylor and Mr . Hudson can't be commended for their excessive smoking in this film . Is this what our army brass has come to ?
421122	2542703	39054	8.0	Two Sisters from Boston Rates	Nice turn of the century film where Kathryn Grayson comes to N . Y . to sing in a joint . Her presence there threatens a scandal in her native Boston as her uncle is the Republican candidate for mayor of the town . He comes with his wife to investigate and the fun starts . June Allyson is her sister and Jimmy Durante , the owner of the place where Grayson is singing . To save Grayson , Durante arranges for her to sing at the opera with the established Lauritz Melchior . Peter Lawford , falls for Allyson but thinks that Grayson is having an affair with his father . The picture becomes funny at times but needed technicolor to brighten it up . Ben Blue is funny as a drunken waiter and Melchior shows some comedic gift here . A pleasant film capturing the turn of the century musical traditions in America .
421525	2542703	43949	8.0	Quo Vadis ? Translation Please	No one has ever bothered to translate into English the meaning of the title . Is it what's wrong ? The film is really mostly spectacle . The scenes of Rome burning were greatly handled . Peter Ustinov gave a magnificent performance as Nero . He totally captured the part . Just watching his facial expressions were a joy . His insanity is unbelievable and you really feel that the emperor is a real nut job . Too bad that both Ustinov and Leo Genn were nominated for best supporting actor . While Ustinov was far better than Genn , the latter had some great philosophical lines which he delivered so admirably . The film really discusses the blame technique which has been used throughout history for dictators to divert the attention of people from their horror . Yes , the Christians were blamed for the decadence of Rome .
420858	2542703	866438	8.0	Love is Even Better than 4 Letters Here	A very satisfying comedy film featuring a girl and guy who meet at the wedding of their best friends . They are truly a perfect match for each other until they walk into court as divorce attorneys handling the opposite side of a divorce case . The film deals with how their handling of the case affects their relationships . This is basically a story of love , conflict , divorce and redemption . This is told along a backdrop of the true California beach scene . The couple who is divorcing after 30 years are being described as a retirement divorce . You hear so much of the husband retiring and the marriage faltering as he is around more often now at the home . This was a very interesting plot and is well resolved by film's end .
421612	2542703	858479	8.0	Smart People isn't Only for the Very Intelligent	Dennis Quaid stars as a self-centered intellectual English professor who still has plenty to learn about learn about life . A widower with 2 children , he has established quite a dysfunctional family . Ellen ( " Juno " ) Page plays Vanessa , his intellectually strung-out daughter who talks about normal sexual mores and is plenty to contend with . There is also a gem of a performance by Thomas Haden Church , who portrays Quaid's adopted brother . Appearing to be one with manual labor skills , Church exhibits a lot of intellectual curiosity while certainly having many hangups as well . We also have Sarah Jessica Parker , a former student , and now a doctor , who meets up with Quaid when he is hospitalized . The story does wilt somewhat when the relationships begin to develop but things are neatly tied up . The film shows you that even the intellectual can get caught up in difficult situations . Being smart isn't as great as it has been made out to be .
421559	2542703	43338	8.0	Ace in the Hole is A Big Carnival	This film was also appropriately titled " The Big Carnival . " What a circus-like media atmosphere is created when sly reporter , Kirk Douglas , goes after a big story in New Mexico . A man becomes trapped in a cave and Douglas decides to exploit the situation to its fullest extent . While the media goes crazy over the situation , Douglas creates a moral dilemma by taking the slow way to free the poor fellow . What Douglas doesn't realize that he is in for is the guy's wife , played memorably by Jan Sterling . Trapped in a loveless marriage , Sterling is convinced by Douglas to hang on . When he becomes too demanding , tragedy results . There is also a nice supporting performance by Porter Hall , usually funny in a movie . This time , Hall attains dramatic heights as the editor . Exploitation has always been a great Hollywood story . This film is no exception to the rule .
421153	2542703	64030	8.0	" Anne of the Thousand Days "	Richard Burton received the 6th of 7 Oscar nominations as Henry V111 in this costumed-lavish production . Burton has the right temperament for the part of the tortured king , obsessed with the idea that he must have a son as a daughter cannot rule England . That hat that he wore throughout the film was ridiculous . The costume designer should have been faulted for making it . He looks so silly in it . Genevieve Bujold shines especially in her condemnation scenes . She plays the role of an ill-fated condemned Anne Boleyn in a much striking difference then say the doomed Queen Marie Antoinette ( Norma Shearer ) Bujold is more resolute in her determination to die for her beliefs . Shearer , touched your heart with that magnetic tear in her eye . That feeling is missing from Bujold's performance . John Colicos is excellent as Cromwell , whose lies would condemn Boleyn ; nevertheless , a supporting actor's nomination was given to Anthony Quayle as Cardinal Wolsey . The latter's morality can certainly be questioned in his bed-scene . Given the woman in the scene , the latter becomes hilarious to view . A majestic movie score well captures the mood of the story . Irene Papas is basically wasted as Catherine of Aragon . A fine actress , her role deserved to be more meaty in content .
421032	2542703	49471	8.0	Dead Man Can Tell An Interesting Tale in Man Who Never Was	Interesting film with Clifton Webb and Gloria Grahame starring in a British plot to fool the Nazis during World War 11 . We wanted the Germans to believe that the invasion would occur in Greece rather than in Sicily . A young man , who died of pneumonia , was used by the British government in the plot to fool the Germans . The first hour of the movie deals nicely with how the British hoped to accomplish this plan . The second part deals with the Nazis sending an Irish spy ( Stephen Boyd ) into Britain to investigate the authenticity of Pvt . Martin , the alleged victim . Interestingly , in the film , Webb and Grahame never appear in any scenes together . Webb is Montague , a British army official , who hatches the plot . Grahame lives with Webb's secretary and accidentally falls into the plot when her boyfriend is killed . Her emotional trauma in a scene with Boyd fools him since he thinks that Grahame's dead boyfriend was Martin indeed . An interesting film with shrewd overtones .
420767	2542703	1065291	8.0	All the Good Ones Are Married - Real Good Ending	Darryl Hannah has really matured from her early years as a girlfriend of the late John F . Kennedy , Jr . and films such as " Splash . " In this film she gives quite a performance as the married wife who brings misery to her family when she takes in a fellow worker to live with . The latter brings havoc to the family by having a brief fling with Hannah's husband . The performances are excellent though the story is riddled with unfortunate usual coincidences such as mother taking ill and Hannah unable to get back to her husband which leads him into the arms of the fellow worker , the worker's frustration by having an unfaithful boyfriend and mother who lives rehabilitation without giving a forwarding address . As her marriage implodes , Hannah gives an excellent performance as the over-working mother whose life seems to have literally fallen apart . There is no violence in this film and the ending is most satisfying . We've seen a lot of this before through the eyes of violence and tragedy .
421370	2542703	49027	8.0	Bottom of the Bottle-Successfully Hits the Bottle	Interesting film dealing with family relationships and ultimate responsibility for family actions . Successful lawyer , Wendell Corey , must come to grips when his convict brother , Van Johnson , escapes from jail and shows up at his doorstep . Corey had abandoned Johnson and a younger sister years before to get away from the poverty stricken family . The film succeeds because it shows the eventual path that must be taken by a sudden ethical turn in the life of Corey . I am my brother's keeper is the theme of this well-played film . Ruth Roman is wonderful as the sympathetic sister-in-law to Johnson . While it is true that the film ultimately turns into a modern day posse-like hunt for Johnson , it succeeds because of its redeeming quality of family relationships above all else .
421522	2542703	44552	8.0	Diplomatic Courier-Cloak & Dagger At its Best	Wonderful Tyrone Power vehicle that will have you guessing every minute along the way . When Power is assigned to deliver important papers , the person who is to receive them can't retrieve them and is eventually murdered . Suspicion centers on Hildegarde Knef , who does quite well in this film . Patricia Neal is in fine form as a wealthy looking widow of an official who comes along and tries to romance Power along the way . What else is this conniving woman up to ? Diplomatic intrigue hasn't been this good in years . Power is sympathetic and will rescue Neff at the end when it appears that she has been truthful to him throughout the film .
421369	2542703	417001	8.0	You Must Love this Dog	Bright quirky comedy dealing with love and relationships with a wonderful cast . John Cusack and Diane Lane are both recent divorcees from others and find romance through the internet and love of dogs . Lane has a strong family to support her emotionally and keep finding possible suitors for her . Nice seeing veteran actor Christopher Plummer in a comedic role as Lane's widowed father who has a variety of dates so that he shall never forget the true love that he lost . One such date is Dolly , played in a very funny way by Stockard Channing . Channing's role is similar to that of the late Maureen Stapleton in " Interiors . " She is a real live wire even after burying her third husband . Dermot Mulroney plays another love interest to Lane . His son is in Lane's pre-kindergarten class . Sit back and enjoy this comedy .
420308	2542703	33024	9.0	Saturday's Children Plays Well	The director of this film died recently as we was approaching 100 . Dennie Moore , who plays the common Gertie , with a typical Brooklyn accent , turns 99 in December . Wonderful seeing John Garfield in a non-gangster role . As the sympathetic Sims , an inventor whose a dreamer , Garfield etches a totally believable character . Anne Shirley plays the girl who loves and tricks him into marriage . Garfield plays basically another George Bailey type . The opportunities are there for him but situations arise which prevent him from fulfilling his dreams . Claude Rains plays his philosophical father-in-law who plots to do away with himself so that Garfield and Shirley can live happily ever after . The two work in the same office , fall in love and marry . With the coming of war , she gets laid off and he is asked to take a pay cut . Sad but realistic . This true to life film does end happily .
420756	2542703	32554	9.0	Great McGinty When the Public Works Didn't Really Work for Public in Fabulous Film	Outstanding writing and direction by pro Preston Sturges highlighted this 1940 satire on politics . To think , public works program being used for graft by crooked politicians is the major theme of this film . As a hobo , who pleases the town political boss , and rises to be mayor and governor , Brian Donlevy etched an unforgettable character . He is great here as the man who marries a woman with 2 children and seems to have it all , only to throw everything away in his attempt to do something honest . While it is true that the ending of the film is a downer , you have to credit Sturges with the marvelous satire that she shows regarding the political world . Akim Tamiroff , as the town boss , is just great in his role . Those eyes would continue to bulge 3 years later in his memorable part as the Spanish revolutionary in " For Whom the Bell Tolls . "
420488	2542703	39041	9.0	Tomorrow Can Be Wonderfully Forever	This excellent 1946 vehicle provides Orson Welles with a role that he is most sympathetic with . Married to Claudette Colbert in this film , he is soon declared missing and dead . Colbert quickly remarries a wealthy gentleman who is most sympathetic when this apparent tragedy strikes . Fast forward 20 years . By chance , Colbert comes across Welles in a new disguise . This is all coming about as World War 11 will envelop Europe . It appears that Welles was not killed off during World War 1 , but merely was missing and apparently suffering from amnesia . The film becomes a heartbreak after this . Both Colbert and Welles really are conflicted here . She suspects that he realizes his true identity now and he realizes that the son she bore is his . Both Colbert and Welles put on some very fine acting here in this film where you had better have plenty of handkerchiers available .
421312	2542703	1224368	9.0	Ladies of the House Were Not Housebound	A typical film dealing with 3 women working on the fixing up of a house left by a church member , so that they can sell the house and provide for needy children , really blossoms out . We soon find out that this work really serves as therapy for these women to combat one whose husband has been stricken with a fatal form of cancer , another whose wealthy husband has been cheating on her with his secretary , and the third whose husband has retired and she now feels that their marriage is faltering . Florence Henderson does a beautiful job as the widow and is equally matched by Donna Mills , the wife of the cheater , who comes down to earth and sees the true value of life by doing this work for their church . The film deals with the fulfillment of life by working for an admirable goal . It succeeds here .
421549	2542703	808348	9.0	Life Support - Gives Life A Chance	A very good film showing the life of a former drug user who works for an outreach program for women with HIV . Queen Latifah , a very fine actress , is well suited for the part of Annie . What makes this film so good is that there is little violence . All the characters give meaning to this very endearing film . Latifah is especially effective in her sessions with other women . There are marvelous supporting performances by the daughter she gave up to her mother . The latter is also quite good . This is a very compelling story detailing the black experience with regard to home life and personal identifications and self-esteem . The Brooklyn locations are a joy to see .
420637	2542703	37094	9.0	Mr . Skeffington	Another great Oscar nominated performance by Bette Davis . In this one , she plays Fanny , a selfish woman who thinks of nothing but her beauty . As she ages , she will do about almost anything to keep youthful looking . The picture begins where she is overwhelmed by a plethora of suitors . Eventually , she will marry a banker , wonderfully played by Claude Rains . Frustrated by getting older , she leaves it out on him and he is eventually driven away . Returning later , Fanny is stunned to see him now blind . Apparently , he was in a Nazi occupied country and being Jewish did not exactly help . She takes him under her arm and leads him away . Now , as a blind man , she will accept him knowing that he can't see her age . This was done in a poignant manner .
421607	2542703	50383	9.0	Fear Strikes Out Hits Home Run	Outstanding biography detailing the life of Boston Red Sox slugger Jimmy Piersall . The late Anthony Perkins depicted the appropriate temperament in his portrayal of this baseball legend . Driven by a domineering , obsessed with perfection father , Perkins is outstanding in his portrayal . He is equally matched by Carl Malden , terrific as the father . From childhood Perkins is seen as being driven by his father to achieve perfection . Nothing less will satisfy the compulsive driven father . The scene where Perkins goes berserk during a game is memorable . His recovery is well staged as well . My diagnosis would have been to keep his father away but to make sure that the viewers see this wonderful film .
420478	2542703	45891	9.0	Really Not How to Wed into Dough . . . But Film Shines ' / 2	Bette Grable , Marilyn Monroe and Lauren Bacall make quite a team in this 1953 fun film . Bacall is the leader of the girl pack whose quest is to get 3 rich guys . They take an expensive apartment along the way . Bacall has by far the best lines in the film . She comes off with her constant wisecracks and they are hilarious at best . Monroe is perfect as her usual dumb blond . Grable is literally Loco in this flick as well . The film reunites David Wayne and Rory Calhoun as two of the suitors . Both had appeared together a year earlier in the Jane Froman musical-drama biography of " With A Song in My Heart " with Susan Hayward . The ending is quite a pleasant surprise . Resigned to marrying a relative pauper , Bacall and the others are literally floored when a millionaire reveals himself instead . A fun film showing that money isn't necessarily everything .
421249	2542703	32831	9.0	My Son , My Son is No Sunny Boy But Shines Anyway	We have often seen in films the self-sacrificing mother and the negative effects it has had on children . This 1940 film deals with a father , who attains wealth as a writer , and has a son that he spoils rotten so that the latter can have everything in life that he didn't . Naturally , tragedy results from all this . Our father is played wonderfully and Louis Hayward , as the son , is excellent as well as the son who ruins the life of so many . Ironically , it is the mother here , a religious woman , who sees from the beginning that there is a need to discipline the boy . The father can't do this and the two argue only to show that their marriage has been a failure . When dad meets Madeleine Carroll , his wife is conveniently killed by being run-over . Ironically , this occurs on her way home from church . The son has also met Carroll and when he learns that his father loves her , he plots to destroy their liaison . The father's friend also marries and has two wonderful children . The daughter grows up to become a famous actress and is indebted to the father for writing her plays . The actress is Lorraine Day , and she is miscast in this film . When he can not have Ms . Carroll , Hayward turns to her and when she finds herself in trouble , the father offers to marry her as the son rejects her . Day takes her life tragically . World War 1 in England intervenes and the son , seeing his father's devotion , becomes a hero but it is too late . An absorbing film dealing with the loving relationship between father and son . It should not be missed .
421048	2542703	1019454	9.0	Taking Chance - What the Results of War Are All About	Kevin Bacon gives a restrained , compelling performance in this film dealing with the meticulous handling of our soldiers killed in Iraq . Every detail is described and the army is very strict about making sure that customs and traditions are fulfilled as the loved ones are returned to their families . It was wonderful seeing Blanche Baker back in films after so many years . The daughter of the legendary Carrol Baker , Blanche won a best supporting actress Emmy over 30 years ago for the memorable " Holocaust " television series . After following this up with a role in Robert Redford's " The Candidate , " she seemed to have dropped out of sight after all these years . " The mortician did the best he could . It is recommended that the body not be shown for viewing . " This line will forever live with me . The film deals with patriotism and how a young man , apparently full of life , died a hero in Iraq while protecting others .
420569	2542703	37280	9.0	Since You Went Away for Memorable Depiction	It's World War 11 at the home front . Claudette Colbert's husband is missing in action . The picture is interesting in the fact that we never see the husband but we do view the trials and tribulations of his family at home . The supporting cast joins Miss Colbert in creating great performances . Colbert was nominated for best actress and Monty Woolley and Jennifer Jones received supporting nominations . The latter had won the best actress Oscar the year before for " The Song of Bernadette . " This was the first time that a best actress winner was nominated in the supporting category . Agnes Moorehead is no slouch either . The veteran thespian shows her grit in a brief but memorable role as an unpatriotic friend of the family . Joseph Cotten , in uniform , as a faithful family friend , provided great emotional support as well . We also have a grown up Shirley Temple as a courageous daughter . As Fidelia , the maid , Hattie McDaniel showed perseverance and determination . She is basically a subdued Mammie in 1944 clothing . That ending scene will cling to your hearts . A triumph of the American spirit in every way .
420950	2542703	62601	9.0	Laugh in Socked it To Us So Well	Fabulous television series running from 1967 to 1973 . What made the show so great was the lively supporting cast associated with it . The sketches with Arte Johnson as the old man starting up with Ruth Buzzi on the park bench were constantly hilarious . Who had the idea to put that net on Buzzi's hair ? It made her look so appropriately ugly . When she swung that pocketbook , we roared with laughter . Then we had Judy Carne saying " Sock it to Me ! " Remember when Richard Nixon said that famous line briefly on the show ? Dick Martin gave us that dead pan like humor and Dan Rowan portrayed the typical slick but constant smoking guy on the show . Joanne Worley was loud but so well suited for this continuous mayhem . I can't imagine how announcer Gary Owen was able to restrain himself from laughing . This show and " That Was the Week That Was " gave new dimension to television .
420730	2542703	32145	9.0	Wuthering Heights - Descends the Clouds	The New York Film Critics defied conventional thought in 1939 by selecting " Wuthering Heights " as the best picture of the year . This must have come as quite a surprise to all the " Gone With the Wind " fans out there . Laurence Olivier will probably be forever remembered as our hero Heathcliff . His love for the Merle Oberon character probably represents one of the greatest love stories that Hollywood ever produced . Olivier was terrific because he was in the brooding move . He showed the same depth of character the following year in " Rebecca . " It is amazing that the motion picture academy passed him up for both performances . Who can ever forget the heather of the film ? Geraldine Fitzgerald , who won the film critics ' award for supporting actress for her role in the film . She played a bitter , loveless woman ready to settle into a grim spinsterhood similar to Olivia De Havilland's " The Heiress . " A memorable production with a memorable cast .
421171	2542703	41373	9.0	Flamingo Road - Upper Society vs . Joan Crawford	A fabulous Joan Crawford vehicle reuniting her with Zachary Scott of " Mildred Pierce " fame . Again , Scott eventually takes a bullet , but this time it's by his own doing . The film came 4 years after " Pierce " and Crawford looks a lot older here , probably because of her lighter hair . The film is a good one involving upper vs . lower class and dirty , corrupt politics in the name of one Sydney Greenstreet , who is just wonderful here . ( I don't know what the other writers wanted with his performance . ) He is the embodiment of the big city corrupt official who will destroy anyone in his path . He thinks he is self-righteous yet and his name of Titus is most appropriate for him . As the carnival girl , trying to build a life for herself , Crawford etched another memorable performance . She is at her best when she lifts herself up from adversity . Scott is wonderful in the role of the guy , pushed up in politics and thrown into a political marriage with disaster resulting . David Brian has his moments as the other shady official who Crawford also falls for . Get yourself to Flamingo Road !
420427	2542703	488120	9.0	Fracture-No Break in this Law	Anthony Hopkins basically continues his eerie ways from " Silence of the Lambs " in this film . Problem is that he is probably a little too old for this part . Nice to see Embeth Davidtz in this picture . It has been 15 years since Ralph Fiennes threw a bookcase at her in " Schindler's List . " Ryan Gosling , on the other hand , is too young for this part . He is supposed to be a hot-shot lawyer on the verge of landing a big position at a law firm . There are some scenes where he looks like an emotionally disturbed young man . The plot here is what saves the film . Carelessness on the part of the Gosling character allows for Hopkins to go free after he has shot his wife in the head . Gosling eventually figures out how Hopkins was able to find the gun . He did it in the way that Jessica Fletcher would in " Murder She Wrote . " All said , this is an engrossing film which keeps you guessing and on edge .
421648	2542703	60420	9.0	Follow Me Boys Tribute to the Boy Scouts	Wonderful Fred MacMurray fanfare dealing with a man who settles in a small rural town in 1930 and in order to impress Vi , ( Vera Miles ) he embarks on a career as the scoutmaster of the town . Little does he know that this will become a lifetime position for him as he guides countless numbers of boys to maturity through 20 years of scouting . The film is an excellent tribute to the Boy Scouts of America . Vera Miles plays the girl he eventually marries . The film deals with the trials and tribulations that he has deal with during his 20 years of work . Lillian Gish is in fine form as Aunt Hetty , who seems to be senile but is anything but . Elliott Reid , her nephew , comes off as the villain here , partly because he had lost Miles to Lem ( MacMurray ) years before . Kurt Russell is absolutely terrific as a difficult youngster who loves his alcoholic father but is embarrassed by him . Russell goes to live with Lem and Vi when the father dies . Heartwarming and poignant , this is really Americana at its best .
420349	2542703	490084	9.0	See this Film " Because I Said So "	Diane Keaton does it again , this time as Daphne , a single mother , totally engrossed in the romantic failures of her daughter . She actually goes through the motion and puts an ad in the newspaper regarding her daughter . She then interviews prospective suitors for the daughter . The latter is well played by Mandy Moore . Complications arise when Moore finds one guy through the ad and another by accident . The picture is then devoted to which fellow she will invariably go with . Further surprises erupt when Keaton finds love with the father of one of the two suitors . The film is the testimony to modern technology with the constant use of cell phones and the internet . It really doesn't get better than this .
420405	2542703	76666	9.0	Great Fever to Catch	John Travolta truly shines as dance hero Tony Monero in this wonderful 1977 production of " Saturday Night Fever . " When Friday night comes around , Tony can quickly forget about the rest of the week , get those dancing shoes ready , dress up and head down to that Bay Ridge Disco and dance the night away . The songs from the Bee Gee's are great . Shockingly , they were not nominated for best song among the Academy Award nominations . Why not ? What was the nominating committee thinking ? Tony has his problems at home and frustration at work . Dancing becomes an outlet for him and what an outlet he has . Fast on his feet , Arthur Murray praised Travolta's dancing in this film ; although , prudish Arthur and Katherine objected to the language . We see the lives of average Italian Brooklynites on the streets of Bay Ridge as well as the disco . Complications ensue . Tony's brother , a priest , comes home and announces that he is leaving the church . There may be homosexual implications but that is fortunately glossed over . Karen Lynn Gorney is an excellent dance partner for Tony . Usual TV good girl , Donna Pescow turns in a surprisingly good performance as a girlfriend rejected by Tony . There is plenty of excitement beyond the dance floor . That memorable scene on the bridge , where tragedy befalls a pal of Tony's , is terrifically done . Get out your dancing shoes and dance up a storm . This is sure one fever well worth catching .
421254	2542703	37884	9.0	The Lost Weekend - Weekend Worth Remembering	Memorable Ray Milland film where he showed Hollywood that he could really act . After playing numerous cads and other Hollywood types , in 1945 Milland gave a well deserved Oscared performance as a writer who is a hopeless drunk . In conveying what a drunk goes through during binge drinking , Milland fully captured the aspects of alcoholism and was honored by Hollywood's highest acting award . The film also gave Jane Wyman an opportunity to break through from her usual silly inane parts up until this film . As the long suffering but dedicated girl friend , Wyman showed that she could handle problem parts adeptly . New York of the 1940s is also well shown . Director Wilder handled details brilliantly here depicting the pawn shops and other stores that are closed on Yom Kippur , the Jewish Day of Atonement . Milland's scenes of delirium and utter despair are memorably shown . He is able to bring us , in a vivid portrayal , what alcoholics go through . His performance showed that alcoholism is a disease . This break through film of 1945 is memorable in that Wilder took on the problem of alcohol addiction . The film would serve as a trail blazer for " Smash Up : The Story of A Woman , " and " I'll Cry Tomorrow . "
421096	2542703	86896	9.0	Angel is Anything But That While Delivering	She was an A student by day and a hooker at night . Living the life of a lie , when in fact , her mother had abandoned her 3 years before , Angel has taken to the street to make a living for herself . On the way , she has met a variety of characters and unfortunately there is a psychopathic killer on the loose who murders 2 of her hooker friends . We have a first rate cast here led by Ms . Wilkes , as our heroine , Rory Calhoun , as Kit Carson who relives his days of long ago on the strip as well as Susan Tyrrell , a foul-mouthed character along with Dick Shawn , who portrays a transvestite quite effectively . Cliff Gorman plays a very understanding police officer . There is action . There is drama , especially when Angel's secret life is discovered and she is humiliated in school . She then goes on a death hunt when May , her friend , is stabbed to death . This is a surprisingly interesting and good film .
421598	2542703	119683	9.0	Les Miserables Not At all Miserable	Phenomenal remake of the Fred March-Charles Laughton classic dealing with a relentless officer's pursuit of a decent man whose sole crime was the stealing of a loaf of bread . The film depicts the conditions in France that would lead to this type of behavior . Excellent performances by Liam Neeson as the victimized Jean Valjean and Geoffrey Rush as the evil inspector made so famous by Laughton in the 1930s . This is a tale dealing with hate caught up in the pursuit of following the law in every detail . It brings forth the 1848 uprising in Paris and in a near tragic coincidental way , brings the inspector back to pursuing Valjean after a 10 year absence . The Paris uprising was never more valiant and the players are true to their form in revolutionary France . A film not to be missed . How come that Neeson doesn't really age as nearly 20 years goes by ?
420479	2542703	369735	9.0	When the Critics Are Wrong : Monster-In-Law Rocks	A surprisingly hilarious spoof on mother-in-law and daughter-in-law to be in their bitter rivalry . Jennifer Lopez meets the doctor of her dreams and they decide to wed . The problem is his mother , Viola , played with relish and great comic timing by Jane Fonda . A pleasure to welcome Fonda back to the silver screen . She plays a neurotic , vicious washed-up Barbara Walters type who can't bare that her precious physician son is marrying supposedly beneath him . The two exchange in bitter rivalry with Lopez eventually turning the tables on Viola . Viola has an assistant , delightfully played by Wanda Sykes . Sykes comes up with one-liners in the tradition of Thelma Ritter . She is a great side kick . Fonda's reaction to the announcement of the engagement hasn't been shown in a funny way . We had the Katie Roth ( Jo Van Fleet ) reaction when Lillian was set to marry David in " I'll Cry Tomorrow , " but that was a totally different genre . Look for veteran Elaine Stritch as Viola's mother-in-law . She steals the scene and gets Fonda to look at herself . A very pleasant surprise of a film . Watch it and chuckle with laughter .
421579	2542703	82766	9.0	Mommie Dearest - Even Any Mother Couldn't Love This	This film is based on adopted daughter Christina Crawford's biography of her legendary screen mother , Joan Crawford . Faye Dunaway gives an absolutely mesmerizing performance as Miss Crawford . Her make-up artist deserved some kind of recognition for those broad shoulders that the late Joan Crawford was known for . Many say that Dunaway's performance was over the top . What are they talking about ? She is absolutely brilliant as the screen icon who was unbelievably brutal to her children . Who can forget the scene with the hangers ? Who can forget the scene after Crawford wins the Oscar for Mildred Pierce ? She acts as if she felt the award was coming to her . No matter what , Crawford was emotionally distraught . Dunaway conveys this in every scene of the film . What made Joan Crawford tick ? As her abused daughter , Diana Scarwid turned in a powerhouse performance as well . Notably absent were Oscar nominations for both Dunaway and Scarwid in the best actress and supporting actress divisions . What has happened to Ms . Scarwid ? She was terrific as well as Bess Truman in the HBO biography of Harry Truman starring Gary Sinise . She seems to have faded from the acting scene . Her presence is missed as well as quality pictures such as this one .
421415	2542703	52522	10.0	Forever Touching-The Untouchables	Outstanding weekly television series of the late 1950s and early 1960s . Who can ever forget that haunting theme music that was played at the beginning and end of each episode ? The show was just terrific , even down to the superb narration of Walter Winchell . Having lost the Academy Award for his brilliant performance in " Written on the Wind , " in 1956 , Robert Stack turned his attention to this television series . He portrayed Eliot Ness , a crime buster of A-1 quality , who would bring down some of the biggest names in crime history . With a terrific supporting cast , each weekly episode was an absolute treasure to view . People such as Nehemiah Persoff and Virginia Vincent had standard stand-out roles . Yes , there was plenty of violence but Chicago of the 1930s was just that .
421555	2542703	32342	10.0	City for Conquest-Captures Mood of N . Y .	Terrific 1940 film where the great James Cagney does it again in giving a memorable performance . This time it's as a fighter who goes into boxing so that his brother , Arthur Kennedy , can fulfill a musical career as well as an escape for girl friend , Ann Sheridan , ditching him for a dancing career with Anthony Quinn , a real cad if there ever were . The film has a tremendous supporting cast and all do a fine job in showing what movie making should be . Future director , Elia Kazan , is in fine form as a mobster , a product of a rough childhood environment . In seeing Kazan here , I wonder what his acting career would have been like had he not chosen to go behind the camera . The aspect of N . Y . life is wonderfully shown by the upper class of musical life , life on the lower east side as well as the boxing center of sports . How they interact in this film is so well memorably accomplished . As a boxing magnate , I thought that the usual erudite Donald Crisp would be miscast . How wrong I was . He evoked much sympathy in trying to protect his fighter-Cagney . A truly memorable film . This is a heck of a movie classic .
420402	2542703	47885	10.0	Blackboard Jungle-Mary Poppins Today !	Having taught in the New York City school system for 32 years and now retired , I am quite qualified to comment on this ground-breaking film . When it came out , few people realized how bad some of our urban schools were . The truth is that the situation is even far worse today . This great film attempts to show the truth about our urban school centers . It depicts the complete lack of discipline as well as a totally inept and unsympathetic school administration . The latter will hide incidents to show that their school is a good one . Glenn Ford is terrific as the idealistic teacher . Having come from the military , he soon sees that the school is worse than many army situations he has encountered . Gang violence is prevalent . Student disruption is constant . Vic Morrow and his gang of thugs , ( yes , Mayor Bloomberg , they are thugs not Transit Workers ) do their best to make sure that no one learns anything and that mayhem is the general order of the day . The scene where Richard Kiley's records are destroyed in front of him by these recalcitrants is memorable . If our society would only realize what these schools have become and do something about it . Instead , teachers are routinely blamed . Teachers must be psychiatrists , psychologists , social workers , and parents for so many who resist learning and authority . The film was an omen for what was to come . Sadly , we have not learned from it . Yes , we try catch phrases like cooperative learning , etc . but the fact remains that teaching cannot be done until there is effective discipline . An for what this film tries to show . Nonetheless , the worst was yet to come .
420270	2542703	37536	10.0	Worthy Sequel to Going My WAy	Believe it or not , I liked The Bells of St . Mary's even better than Going My Way . Bing Crosby , once again was Father O'Malley , in a new parish , with new problems and in competition with the Sister , in a wonderful performance by Ingrid Bergman . There is the expansion of the school to contend with . Then , there is Patsy , a troubled child . When she does not pass her graduation exams , will that lead to further conflict between Crosby and Bergman ? Crosby and Bergman were nominated for Oscars but did not win and the picture was not proclaimed the best by the motion picture Academy , the award going to The Lost Weekend instead . When Bergman is suddenly transferred , she feels that this is being done due to the fact that O'Malley doesn't like her . It is only at the last minute that Bergman is informed that she has to leave as she has tuberculosis . The picture ends and we feel that we have just seen a great film , regardless of race and religion , we are left with such a positive , good feeling .
421097	2542703	32143	10.0	These Are Really Dames ! The Women	Highest rating for this superb version of the Clare Booth Luce film dealing with what gossip can do to happy people . 1939 was certainly a banner year for motion pictures . Amazing to me that " The Women " was not nominated for best picture . What a brilliant idea not to use men in the film but to refer to them constantly . What an all-star cast is prevalent is this grand production . The dialogue is snappy and absolutely first rate . The wonderful Norma Shearer is Mary Haines , whose marriage falls when she allows gossip by a manicurist to get the best of her . Joan Crawford is as viciously good as ever as Crystal Allen . Who can beat Roz Russell in the wonderful part of Sylvia Fowler . Mrs . Fowler , friends like her you never needed . A golden masterpiece of a treasure .
421627	2542703	111257	10.0	Speed-Wonderful Bumpy Ride	If Bette Davis were alive when this marvelous action film was made , she would have certainly said to fasten your seat belts as we're in for a bumpy ride . What a wonderful bumpy ride it is . This is a fast paced , high action thriller . We have the usual lunatic mad bomber , this time played marvelously by Dennis Hopper , disgruntled and off his rocker , who plants bombs in elevators , buses and finally creates havoc on a train . Keanu Reeves is terrific as the cop who foils his plans at every turn along with Jeff Daniels . This is the latter's best film since he played the ill-fated son-in-law of Shirley MacLaine in the 1983 Oscar winner " Terms of Endearment . " Sandra Bullock turned in a fantastic performance as the woman on the bus who winds up having to drive it under such tense circumstances . If all action films were like this . Intelligently written , well acted , and a great story line to boot !
420734	2542703	43299	10.0	Feeling Great With As Young As You Feel	You come away feeling great after seeing this 1951 gem . Notice that LaMar Trotti did the screenplay and co-starred Thelma Ritter and David Wayne . The three were together the following year in " With A Song in My Heart . " Note how Ritter acted almost in the way she did the following year in " Heart . " Notice again the references to Brooklyn in her early lines . This film is inspiring because in a comical way it covers some social issues that are pertinent today . A man , played by the wonderful Monty Woolley , protests when he is victimized by the mandatory age of retirement rule . He makes believe he is the head boss of the concern and gives a terrific speech calling for hard work , individual initiative and the end to forced retirements . The speech causes a huge success and leads to one of the boss's wives wanting to leave him to run off with Woolley . Constance Bennett is great as the woman whose marriage has lost its sparkle and husband , Albert Dekker , who is a constant worker . David Wayne and Jean Peters play the young lovers in this highly entertaining , enjoyable , feel-good movies of the early ' 50s . Notice a young Russ Tamblyn here as a teenage son of Dekker and Bennett's .
421035	2542703	43208	10.0	We All Loved Lucy	Memorable comedy show of the 1950s . How daring of Lucille Ball to go on television with her Cuban born husband , Desi Arnaz , in 1951 . CBS took a bold step and the dividends certainly paid off . Even though they didn't get along at all off the cameras , Vivian Vance and William Frawley were the perfect neighbors for Lucy and Desi . It was Ethel who was also a part of Lucy's hair-brained schemes . Lucy always wanted to break into show business . Lucy was jealous of Desi . One show was where Lucy thought that Desi was going to kill her . Naturally , the classic shows was where Lucy advertised a vitamin , stepped on grapes , got her head caught in a vase , met various stars , and would be told by Desi to start ' splaining . Fred Mertz ( Frawley ) did a great imitation of Jack Benny's cheapness . Remember Mrs . Trumbull , the landlady ? She was played by Elizabeth Patterson , a veteran actress who played just about everyone's mother in Hollywood . How can we forget the panic that ensued when Lucy told Desi that she was ready to give birth ? We sure loved Lucy .
421276	2542703	57193	10.0	Mad World Absolute Magnificent Mayhem	Go know that Stanley Kramer , best known for his films regarding social issues , would make such comical masterpiece . Go know that Ethel Merman , who could belt out any song in her day , would give a phenomenal comic performance is this all-star classic of 1963 . The picture begins with a great musical score which sets mood for what you are about to see . Jimmy Durante , plunges down a ditch and in his revealing words , tells of money hidden under the Big W at a California park . This sets off a wild and extremely memorable chase by those who have heard his words . Others will join in this mayhem . Kramer knew how to get every well known comedian into this hysterically funny film . Often used by Stanley Kramer in his other dramatic films , Spencer Tracy , as the frustrated police officer does an unusual comic performance and he was really good at it . Sid Caesar and Edie Adams are phenomenal as well as the dentist and his wife caught up in this chase for the money . Milton Berle goes through plenty with a mother-in-law such as Ethel Merman . The casting director deserves a lot of credit here for casting Ethel in the loud-mouth mother-in-law role . She really steals the films with her hysteria and antics . I would have thought of Connie Gilchrist for the part of Mrs . Marcus , but Merman is in fine form here . She gets great additional support from Dick Shawn , who portrays her crazy son and British comedian Terry-Thomas who meets up with the group and is drawn into the conspiracy . Phil Silvers is at his devilish best here . The way he orders around people reminds us of his presence as Sgt . Bilko in that classic television series . Jonathan Winters will just break you up here , especially when he goes berserk and destroys a gas station run by Marvin Kaplan and Arnold Stang , who were also made for their parts . The film may exaggerate what people would do for the mighty buck but it gives you the feel-good attitude and is certainly a classic to behold . The film also reunited Tracy with Mickey Rooney , 25 years after they made Tracy's Oscar-winning " Boys Town . " The film marked the end of Za-Su Pitts ' career . Ailing during the film , she died of cancer the same year the film came out . Note that Paul Ford , Ben Blue and Carl Reiner , all had smaller roles in this film but would be used 4 years later in the equally hilarious " The Russians Are Coming , The Russians Are Coming . " A time honored classic . Better now to see it at home . When I viewed the film in the theater , people were laughing out so loud that you couldn't hear the words .
420692	2542703	47574	10.0	There's No Picture Like This One	Ethel Merman and Dan Dailey - a perfect movie couple in the rousing There's No Business Like Show Business . The Donahues sing on the stage and raise a family along the way . As adults , Johnny Ray , who could really act as well as sing , chooses the priesthood . Mitzi Gaynor is on stage , but she soon weds and a child follows ( after the appropriate time ) The problem is Donald O'Connor . In trouble as a child , he is definitely the difficult one . He grows up and meets showgirl Marilyn Monroe , who is just perfect here . He gets into a car wreck before his big break on stage can take place . Admonished by Dailey , who slaps him across the pace , O'Connor disappears . Dailey hopelessly searches for him . The end when the family is reunited will make you shed plenty of tears . The chemistry between Merman and Dailey is perfect-far better than what I had in high school . Seriously , their musical talents are greatly depicted . Merman belts out the title song as no one else can . This is one great musical family and film .
421467	2542703	422093	10.0	Diary of A Mad Black Woman Scores	They just don't make pictures like this anymore . A high-powered attorney accepts the Jacob Feinstein Award for Attorney of the Year and soon qualifies as a heel not seen since Fred MacMurray's performance in " The Apartment . " He bodily throws his wife of 18 years out to be with his lover and the two children he has fathered with her . Our heroine returns to her poor dysfunctional family including 2 relatives who are hilarious at best . Bent on retribution , she returns to the mansion with one of them-a big fat grandma-like lady and they begin their path of destruction . What you think is your typical comedy of revenge soon turns into a fine drama with the power of love , religion and redemption conquering all . I haven't seen a movie turn from such comedy to drama since 1983's " Terms of Endearment . " Cicely Tyson is wonderful in a supporting role as a mother with strong religious convictions . She talks and acts like Jane Pittman . The movie shows that wickedness may be paid by punishment followed by redemption . It's a powerful message and is quite well done .
420843	2542703	57329	10.0	Move Over , Darling-What's the Guy Supposed to do ?	Absolutely hysterical film dealing with a guy , James Garner , who remarries only to find out that very day that first wife , Doris Day , has survived a plane crash in the jungle and has come home to him . Polly Bergen is just sensational as the 2nd wife caught up in all the mayhem . James Garner , who costarred with Day later on in " The Thrill of It All , " is very good here as the victimized husband who may very well have an ax to grind himself . What was Day doing all those years on an island with Chuck Connors ? The picture also allowed a re-teaming of Day with Thelma Ritter from 1959's " Pillow Talk . " The always wonderful Ritter fits in beautifully in the mother-in-law role . Acting kudos to Edgar Buchanan as the harried judge and to Fred Clark , the hotel guy who must put up with the antics of Garner , Day and Bergen in the hotel . Day must have taken lessons from Loretta Young in giving an authentic Swedish accent in several scenes . Going Swedish gave Loretta a 1947 Oscar for " The Farmer's Daughter . " Too bad that Garner , Day , Bergen and Buchanan were not considered for Oscars .
421493	2542703	55312	10.0	Pocketful of Wonderful Miracles	Glenn Ford and the late Hope Lange in a comedy with Bette Davis taking a supporting role . Interesting enough , this crowd pleaser works quite well . Dave The Dude ( Ford ) is a gangster on the verge of making a big deal . Dave is superstitious . He always must get an apple from that vagrant-looking Davis . Davis , as Apple Annie , was phenomenal in this film . She acts just like an old broken down bag-lady . She does it with a finesse . ( Is it really possible to have a refined bag-lady , you bet it is . ) Anyway , it appears that Davis has a daughter living abroad all these years . Ann-Margret is she and the latter thinks that her mother is high society . Trouble now is that Ann is getting engaged to a count and they're coming to New York to look mom over . Dave and his girlfriend , Lange , fix up Davis to make her look like a dowager . They even provide a husband for her-Thomas Mitchell ! As if this isn't funny enough , we have Peter Falk , in a truly worthy Oscar nominated supporting performance , as Dave's sidekick who can't fathom what is going on . Edward Everett Horton is the butler who can't take bad endings . Fortunately , for him , the film has anything but that kind of ending . It's up-beat down to the last laugh . When " the kids " sail away , Apple Annie resorts to her old ways by even announcing that her prices have gone up to her faithful friends . A romp and memorable film .
421624	2542703	375986	10.0	Mother Teresa is A Spiritual Mother for All Seasons	Marvelous film showcasing the excellent acting talent of Olivia Hussey . Hard to believe that it's over 35 years since her 1968 interpretation of " Romeo and Juliet . " This is an extremely inspiring story of the nun who looked for the most simplicity of life in aiding the impoverished . Her dedication to the suffering of mankind is definitely an inspiration to us all . Not only does the picture beautifully capture what she must endure working among the impoverished , it also shows the problems that she goes through within the Catholic church , accusations of corruption and trying to accomplish her goals in a society that is not accustomed to handle what she wants done . Hussey is simply magnificent in the part of this saintly woman . She has her down to every movement of her walking , talking , etc . Too bad that the film did not bring out that Mother Teresa came from an affluent Albanian family . A wonderful film of the human spirit .
420811	2542703	34092	10.0	Remember the Day - Dewey A Winner Here	A marvelous film in the genre of Miss Dove , Mr . Chips and every wonderful teacher you ever had . The role was just perfect for Claudette Colbert . She really worked magic with co-star John Payne . This picture really offers Americana circa 1916 in Indiana . The embodiment of the school structure at that time is so well done . The obedient student , the prim and proper schoolteachers who dedicated their lives to teaching and nothing else . Nora Trinell ( Colbert ) is a dedicated , wonderful teacher but she goes against what society thought of as a role for teachers when she finds love with Payne . The " crisis " that leads to his dismissal and his ultimate redemption on the part of the principal is beautifully done here . For me , the picture was so good because Trinell reminded me of my grade 5 teacher who inspired me in the field of social sciences . Colbert , as the teacher who found love and tragically lost it , has one of her best film roles here . A caring person to her students , especially Dewey , she certainly tells the truth when she says that each year a teacher finds a student who she can really love as her own . Those words will forever stay with me . As the typical spinster teacher , Anne Revere , was wonderful . Prone to be a gossip , she embodied what society thought was the role of a teacher in this period . The ending will tug at your heart . Nostalgic and so wonderfully realized .

The gang's plan begins to go awry as the bank had been sold a week before and new technology was brought in . A high speed chase only brings more excitement in this action packed film . Alan Arkin plays an aging executive who is suspicious of Ford's erratic behavior . A must see film . Excellent summer fanfare .
420531	2542703	326315	10.0	Harry Truman : A President for All Seasons	Outstanding biography of our nation's 33rd president . While it was becoming apparent that Harry Truman was failing at everything he did , when it came to the presidency , he succeeded more than anyone could imagine . The documentary showed how Truman went into politics thanks to Boss Pendergast . It depicted the dilemma that Truman found himself in . Wanting to do right as the county commissioner but tied to the strings of this malevolent boss . Truman may have been a footnote in senate history had it not been for his work on showing corruption in defense in the 1940s . The work that he did on the committee certainly caught the eye of President Roosevelt . Though it is said that Roosevelt didn't think much of Sen . Truman , it is hard to believe that despite Roosevelt's failing health , that he didn't care who the Democratic bosses picked as his running mate in 1944 . We have to say thank the Lord for the bosses . Had Vice President Henry Wallace been renominated for V . P . , this country would have been in a lot of difficulty . What a tumultuous presidency Truman would have with the threatened railroad strike , use of the a-bomb to end World War 11 , Berlin blockade and Korea . When Truman left office in 1953 , his approval rating was 32 % . History has judged him a lot better than that .
421221	2542703	57997	10.0	Dead Ringer-Classic Bette At Her Best	Bette Davis is just fabulous here as the embittered sister who kills her recently widowed twin sister and assumes her identity . What makes this film so good is what Bette has to go through to keep this charade going . From the handwriting , to recognizing friends and rooms in the mansion , Bette has a field day . The irony here is great when Bette realizes what a witch her sister is but it's too late to do anything about it . Just seeing why Bette goes to the chair at the end is just unbelievable . Surrounded by an excellent supporting cast consisting of Peter Lawford as the playboy boy-friend of dead sister Margaret and Karl Malden as the man who loved Edith , the sister who has done the killing . This film has been tremendously under-rated . Not to be missed !
421037	2542703	86765	10.0	Where Jessica Visits , Murder Always Follows	Outstanding television series where retired English teacher , Jessica Fletcher , a mystery writer tries successfully to solve a murder each week . No matter where Angela Lansbury goes , there is always a murder . She is almost like Columbo in her pursuit for the culprit . The show was a field day for Angela Lansbury to further showcase her brilliant acting talent . Of course , as far as I'm concerned , there will never be another Angela as Mrs . Iselin in 1962's " The Manchurian Candidate . " Angela , as Mrs . Iselin , portrayed a monster of a woman , one of the worst female characters ever depicted on screen . The show " Murder , She Wrote " was further enhanced by having veteran performers as guest stars on the show . Regulars , such as William Windom , certainly added spice . You knew it was Sunday night when that familiar opening theme began the show . The theme sounded like an ice cream trucking coming along the block . As is the case with ice cream , the show was equally delicious .
420802	2542703	31385	10.0	Goodbye , Mr . Chips-R . Donat Was Certainly Teacher of the Year	Outstanding film with Robert Donat in an Oscar winning performance as a beloved schoolteacher in England . Donat's Oscar win must have certainly been astonishing in a year where he vied for the award with Clark Gable , " Gone With the Wind , " Laurence Olivier , " Wuthering Heights , " Mickey Rooney , " Babes in Arms , " and James Stewart , " Mr . Smith Goes to Washington . " Though his Oscar was probably a surprise , it was well deserved because Mr . Donat captured the very essence of a well-liked teacher at the school for boys . He really represented the embodiment of what teaching is all about . Greer Garson played his stoic wife , who dies in childbirth . Though she received a best actress Oscar bid for this film as well , her performance was certainly no match for winner Vivien Leigh , " Gone With the Wind , " or fellow nominee , Bette Davis , " Dark Victory , " Who can forget Donat's perseverance and dedication despite the loss of his wife ? His spirit certainly depicted the stiff upper lip idea shown by Brits in times of emergency . With it all , Donat as Chips conveyed the idea of a brilliant , stern but compassionate educator .
420499	2542703	101921	10.0	Fried Green Tomatoes in Forever Tasty	Wonderful motion picture with a stellar cast . Kathy Bates , as Mrs . Couch , along with her husband , go to a nursing home repeatedly to visit his cantankerous aunt . While they get thrown out of her room repeatedly , Bates soon strikes up a friendship with one of the residents who tells her an unbelievable story of love , tragedy , redemption in the south following World War 1 . The older woman is marvelously played by the late Jessica Tandy , who received a best supporting Oscar nomination for her performance . There are wonderful performances by Mary Stuart Masterson and Mary Louise Parker who form a life's friendship following the tragic death of one's brother while trying to retrieve a hat lost by the other woman along railroad tracks . This is a story of a brutal marriage subjected to one of the girls . It is well told along the backdrop of the 1930s and the Ku Klux Klan operating in both Alabama and Georgia . The picture works well because it treats a murder of the abusive husband in a comical way and there is a triumph of the human spirit along the way . This film was vastly under-rated .

As Rena Marlowe , Carroll Baker gets the role of a lifetime that she was born to play . As the sultry sex-pot , Marlowe , Baker is absolutely brilliant as the woman who was destined for tragedy despite the men in her life , her carefree swinging from a Paris chandelier , and her ultimate road accident . Just when you thought you saw that character die with Marlowe's car crash , along comes Martha Hyer , another brassy blond on the way to replace her as a screen icon . Hyer sheds her usual high class lady as was the case with her Miss French in " Some Came Running , " and gives a marvelous performance as the tramp who loves Cord but must leave him when she realizes that all he wants her for is for him to pursue his wayward life . The film has everything . Greed is adeptly shown by Martin Balsam and Robert Cummings as 2 Hollywood moguls out for the all-mighty dollar . Elizabeth Ashley , as the wife of Jonas , is vulnerable , and what she has to put up with ! Alan Ladd shines as Cord's friend and eventual enemy who finally makes him come to terms with his reasons for his brutal behavior . The film even has insanity as its subject matter and even that is handled beautifully
