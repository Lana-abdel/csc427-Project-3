420968	2542703	147612	1.0	Happiness is Anything But . . .	This is a real clinker of a movie . It is certainly not for the squeamish among us . This story of a dysfunctional family puts the word dysfunctional over the top in most dictionaries . We don't have to be reminded that a psychiatrist could be a child molester and that Camryn Manheim , who really throws her weight around on screen , could have killed a doorman and chopped his body into pieces . There is one solid performance and that belongs to Jane Adams as the youngest sister who appears to be the biggest loser of them all . Unlucky in forming solid relationships , she falls for a Russian cab driver who is out to get her money . As she did in her Oscar nominated supporting performance in " Junebug , " Miss Adams pulls out all the emotional stops here as well . She will be the next Joanne Woodward as she matures in films . She evokes plenty of frustration and emotional turbulence in her roles . It's just the poor quality of this film that does her in .
420565	2542703	400525	1.0	Ice Harvest It's Not Even for the ( Snow ) Birds !	Ridiculous nonsense involving an attorney ( John Cusack ) and his pal ( Billy Bob Thornton ) who steal $2 . 1 million from the mob in Kansas City . Robert Benton , the screenwriter for this nonsense , never bothers to explain to us how they were able to pull this caper off . Perhaps , that might have made for better entertainment . Instead , this misery of a film becomes a shooting and stabbing film . The scene at the river is just gruesome enough . Cusack thinks that Billy Bob is dead . He isn't but the latter's wife is thanks to Thornton putting a bullet in back of her head . Thornton tells Cusack that the mobster did it but as the latter is felled by a bullet , he blurts out that Billy Bob killed his own wife . Then there is a girlfriend who helps Cusack kill the other mobster , a disgusting looking Randy Quaid . If this is called black comedy , please bring in the light of day . Simply awful .
420820	2542703	365485	1.0	This Matador is Full of Bull	Absolutely terrible film dealing with a burned out assassin ( Julian ) , played by a hard drinking , heavy smoking Pierce Brosnan and his chance meeting with a conventional business person Danny ( Greg Kinnear ) The two become friends as Julian tells Danny that he is burned out . He can get out of this deal by doing one more job-the job we find out is killing his boss ! The gags are ridiculous . This is a very amateurish , inane comedy . Kinnear tells Julian that his son was killed in a school bus accident . Julian changes the subject and that ticks off Danny . The viewers should be ticked off with the rest of this foolishness as well .
421466	2542703	37420	1.0	I Was Up in Arms After Seeing this Picture	A colossal Danny Kaye bomb . It's amazing that Danny's film career went anywhere after a film as miserable as this . This was not the film to showcase his talents . Dana Andrews was not for musicals . It was as simple as that . He played his sidekick in this and was Jeanne Crain's love interest in " State Fair . " Andrews hit his stride in " The Best Years of Our Lives . " Danny is a severe hypochondriac in this film . He gets drafted and loves Constance Dowling who doesn't have the heart to tell him that it's Andrews who is her love interest . Dinah Shore , as Virginia , loves Danny but he can't see it . General mayhem develops when all 4 of the characters are on the ship and Dowling becomes a castaway by accident . Look for Margaret Dumont in 2 brief scenes . I guess she was taking a respite from the Marx Brothers . She is not even at her gawky best here . Also miscast are Louie Calhern and Lyle Talbot , both wonderful character actors , who have little to do here and are wasted . Dinah sings nicely and I guess that she and Kaye make a nice Jewish couple . That's about it .
421407	2542703	470765	1.0	For Your Consideration-How Dumb Can You Get ?	A truly awful film depicting what goes on during the making of a film as well as Oscar time . We've seen ideas like this before with Maggie Smith in " California Suite " and Stephen Boyd in 1966's " The Oscar . " However , these films were far superior to this nonsense . That stupid film " Home for Purim " is so obnoxious because the Jewish players are anything but Jewish . We could have sung when Irish eyes are smiling . Note that due to political correctness , the name of the film was changed to " Home for Thanksgiving . " The good part of the film was showing what happens when the supposed stars don't get the Oscar nominations and literally fade into oblivion . Until that point is made , the film is useless .
421246	2542703	373469	1.0	Kiss Kiss Bang Bang-Kiss this One Good Bye	Absolutely dreadful film . At the end of the film , you will definitely ask yourself what this film is all about . You will not be able to answer this as well . I realize that Robert Downey Jr . has had a tough life doing drugs . Must he submit to scripts such as this one ? It's enough for him to revert back to his old habits . In it , a guy running from the police comes into an audition like situation for a part . He reads the part brilliantly and is immediately confused for a Marlon Brando-method-like acting person . After that , it's off to Hollywood parties with plenty of shooting , chase sequences and other nonsense galore . What's going on here ? Corbin Bernsen appears as a father who took some drastic measures to prevent his own daughter from suing him . Someone should sue the director or the movie chains subjecting patrons to see this miserable mess .
421622	2542703	477348	1.0	No Country for Old Men-No Picture for Anyone	I was terribly disappointed after seeing this Oscar winning film for 2007 . Why did this picture win the best picture Oscar ? It is absolutely horrendous . The Coen brothers seem to have a very warped view of life as we saw in FARGO and O BROTHER , WHERE ART THOU ? If I were Javier Bardem , I would have been embarrassed to accept the award for best supporting actor for playing a totally depraved killer . His voice sounded as if he were on record and was placed on slow speed . While he portrays an absolute maniac , it was just horrible to see how he goes around with his gun blasting away at his victims . The film would have been much better had it been more about the drug deal going wrong . Instead , we see 2 guys after money and we know that the latter is the root of all evil . Tommy Lee Jones becomes a philosopher in the last scene of the film . Did anyone realize that the movie ended abruptly ? This is a totally awful film , way too violent for my taste and others .
421172	2542703	39500	1.0	Had to Be You - Shouldn't Be Yours to See	Total stinker involving Ginger Rogers who says no to 3 guys during her wedding ceremonies . She finally meets up with Cornel Wilde , dressed as an Indian , at a station . Wilde is supposed to be some guardian angel . The film is an absolutely stupid series of events where Wilde emerges as a fireman , the only true love for Rogers . Seems that the two of them knew each other years before when she was 6 . He also has left 3 women at the altar . The film might have been better had it try to develop further the relationship between a wealthy society girl and a fireman . Wilde looks like he is having a good time here . The audience certainly was not .
420694	2542703	115964	1.0	This Film is Awful Big Time Don't Confuse With Oscar Winner	One of the worst films I have seen in recent memory . The automobile association and others should be up-in-arms with this trash . We are seeing the glorification of automobile accidents . This is outrageous . A group of people are aiming for Jayne Mansfield and James Dean like fatal accidents . What an awful plot ! With today's violence , who needs junk like this for our teens to see ? To state that smashing up a car is conducive to sexual freedom is the sickest message one can give . This film should be banned from the universe .
421456	2542703	40974	1.0	The Woman in White-Fade to Black Quickly	Miserable film showcasing 2 excellent acting performances . John Emery , as Percival , a nervous wreck is simply marvelous here . He can't take any noise and I wonder how he could have taken any of this miserably crafted and written film . Sydney Greenstreet is so good here because the part of being so sinister was made to order for him . Eleanor Parker has the pleasure of have a dual role here , as one woman , victimized by a fortune hunter and another , dressed in white , who is absolutely off her mind . Speaking of off , Agnes Moorehead looks like a mannequin here . She is totally off the wall and is a perfect foil for " husband " Greenstreet . The writing is simply awful and dull . The film is a period piece taking place in Victorian England of 1851 . The dark , somber mood is befitting here .
420969	2542703	443453	1.0	Borat : Bring Back Censorship	After viewing this very poor imitation of a movie , I really believe that censorship needs to be enforced more so than ever in the motion picture industry . This film is a disgusting , vulgar attempt at comedy . It fails miserably . This picture is highly insulting to Jewish people . Other groups are made to look like fools as well . As someone of the Jewish faith , Sacha Cohen should be ashamed of himself in participating in such nonsense . The scene with the feces is vile . I had to run out of the room when this is shown . From the first scene , I expected a far better movie . Once he comes to America , the film goes downhill rapidly . A monumental mess .
420566	2542703	29842	2.0	Adventures of Polo . . . . Mr . Deeds Goes to Chinatown ?	The above statement is what one critic referred to when the film came out in 1938 . It is simply an awful amateurish-like production by Samuel Goldwyn . Mr . Goldwyn produced an absolute bomb here in his depiction of Polo ( Gary Cooper ) going to China . By the way , with the exception of a map stating Cathay , ancient Cathay is referred to as China in this film . Who did the research for Mr . Goldwyn here , the 3 stooges ? The acting is just awful . Gary Cooper comes across like a western star and Sigrid Gurie , his leading lady , must have thought she was doing a poor imitation of Luise Rainer in " The Good Earth . " You know you're in for it when Ernest Truex , the bookkeeper , goes singing " Marco Polo " on a gondola at the beginning of the film . Alan Hale and Binnie Barnes play leaders in western China where the Kublai Khan sends them to . The Khan , played by a fellow by the last name of Barbier , sounds like a Brooklyn or Bronx truck man . Barnes and Hale are completely unfaithful to each other . Basil Rathbone , as evil as ever as the horrible Ahmed , minister to the khan , even looks disgusted and rightfully so by all this . H . B . Warner provides the firecrackers , spaghetti and gun powder for all this . Goldwyn lost a bundle on this mess and rightfully so . Since Technicolor was sparingly used in 1937 , the film did not have it . It would not have helped .
420274	2542703	386588	2.0	No Pitch for Stitch	You know the old story . So and so can help anyone except himself . We find it again in Hitch , a silly movie about basically silly characters . The best scene of this poor film is probably at Ellis Island . Will Smith is certainly no Dear Abby . His help almost backfires on him . The character Allegra , to me , was deadpan . With that name , she would be more needed to clear up my allergic reaction to this film . I love the way that characters , who supposedly can't dance , can dance up a storm , especially when they're playing fat nerdy type individuals . Even the psychiatrist character in the film needs help . I still can't figure out her brief over-the-top hysterical outburst . Maybe , the film would have better been served with a Barbra Streisand like rendition of " People needing people . " This film , for sure , needs a complete makeover . .
421448	2542703	37892	2.0	Man Alive in Dead End Film	I knew that something was amiss . Pat O'Brien , in a leading role ? No gangsters ? Not a police officer . Really ! Here he stars in this pure stinker as a husband who loves his wife but forgets her birthday . The wife , played by Ellen Drew , looked so much like Eve Arden in many scenes . How coincidental that as he forgot her birthday , her divorced friend from college , enters the movie . Played by Rudy Valee , the guy wants Drew . O'Brien storms out of the house and to the local bar . There he meets a poor drunkard chap , both get plastered , exchange clothes and papers and go on a drunken ride , ending in death for the other guy and total confusion for the rest of the film . The film basically becomes slapstick . O'Brien lands on a riverboat and meets Adolph Menjou , who convinces him to act like a ghost . The two return to the house just as the will is being read . When O'Brien told Drew to continue her life , Valee immediately proposes marriage . O'Brien acts as the ghost to " terrorize " Drew and mayhem and general wackiness ensues . Rate this and be off .
420810	2542703	48183	2.0	How to Be Very , Very Popular - Is Anything But	The film starts off as if I was seeing " Some Like it Hot " years before . Two strip-tease dancers witness the shooting death of a Chinese stripper on stage and are pursued by police and the killer alike . Sounds funny and promising but the film soon falls into a trap of utter stupidity . Bette Grable ( too old for the part ) and Sheree North are the two fleeing strippers who wind up in a college dormitory and cause mayhem there . North is accidentally hypnotized by Tommy Noonan and spends much of the picture in a hypnotic state . How fortunate for her . There are two really good performances here by Charles Coburn , as the college dean , more interested in the college getting money than actually providing education and Alice Pearce , as a wacky housemother in the school . Fred Clark , as the millionaire father , who doesn't know that his son , Orson Bean , has been expelled is given the part of the guy getting hit over the head as he is confused with the killer . Rhys Williams gets the same treatment as North's father . Bette Grable plays Stormy Tornado . Stormy ? This storm blew out to sea . Big-time .
420912	2542703	466909	3.0	The Omen 2006-Enough With the Brat Already	The 1976 film was enough for me . " The Omen " has had several sequels . Why did they bother to make this film over again ? At least , the original had Gregory Peck and Lee Remick who brought some radiance to their doomed roles . In this version , Liev Schrieber and Julia Stiles are terribly miscast . Their chemistry is non-existent even before that little monster shows up to ruin their lives . Mia Farrow , as that evil nanny , has some good moments but even she is no match to Billie Whitelaw who starred in the original . Whatever became of Whitelaw ? She was the embodiment of evil with those large eyes . Farrow , on the other hand , acts like she is in " Rosemary's Baby " and is trying to emulate co-star , the Oscar winner , Ruth Gordon . Ms . Farrow , a Minnie Castevet , you're not !
421225	2542703	47878	3.0	Big Combo is Combustible 1 /	Despite a sterling cast , this 1955 film noir is absolutely dreadful . The film is done in by weak writing an extremely poor character development . As always , Richard Conte gave a gem of a performance . This time he is an evil man caught up in being a gangster for all seasons . Unfortunately , we don't know what kind of rackets he is in and after viewing this film , we really wouldn't care to know . Conte is good here because he captures his usual vicious self on screen . Seeing him here , you are reminded of his great performance as Tony Barden in " I'll Cry Tomorrow . " The latter was the same year as " Big Combo . " Cornel Wilde is terribly miscast as the police detective trying to get the goods on Conte through the women in the latter's life . An equally bad performance is done by Jean Wallace , who talks like Melanie Griffith . The film goes down in quality rapidly as the bodies begin to pile up . Earl Holliman appears as one of Conte's hoods . He is as dumb as a stump . Did he ever show any creative intelligence in his films ? Even veteran actor Ted de Corsia is weak in a one scene act where he divulges information on Mr . Brown . ( Conte )
421426	2542703	39661	3.0	Nightmare Alley - Belongs With the Alley Garbage	After seeing Tyrone Power masterpieces of " The Long Gray Line , " and " Witness for the Prosecution , " this " Nightmare Alley " is just that-one big nightmare . Power was 33 years old when he made this misery of a film . Joan Blondell , his first love interest in the film , looked old enough to be his mother . In fact , the picture goes downhill rapidly after Blondell's part is practically removed from most of the film . Power has some moments as the carnival barker especially at the beginning of the film as well as at the end when he has been relegated to a drunkard . However , the body of the film suffers greatly from absolute boredom . Helen Walker , as the analyst-turned thief abetting Power with his scheme , to fleece a wealthy family , is an interesting character in a rather hopeless film .
420939	2542703	120533	4.0	This Celebrity is Just Not that Famous to Me	Kenneth Branagh assumed the part that a younger Woody Allen would have had in " Celebrity . " As always , this Woody Allen creation deals with relationships . Judy Davis steals this film in the role of a plain-Jane looking woman who is divorced by Branagh , as he is looking for more fulfillment in his life . While in an office regarding a face lift , the English teacher Judy meets up with a producer who is doing a feature on the facial doctor . Joe Montegna plays the producer and he falls for her without her doing anything to her face . Davis shows her adeptness at comedy . In fact , she is even better here at being funny than when the role requires more serious acting . One line I regarded as utter stupidity by Allen . It is when Branagh states that he would do something even if it meant getting terminal cancer . Besides being a horrible thought , this line was totally insensitive to cancer patients . Davis can't believe that she has fallen in so good . In fact , it is she herself who almost ruins things by jilting Joe at the altar . A seer saves the day . By film's end , we see Branagh having nothing in his life other than a few trysts with others who prove themselves to be faithless and dimwitted .
421321	2542703	837119	4.0	Jane Doe-Keep Her Anonymous	Muddled story with stolen art , American Nazis , and an entire host of things included . Despite a stellar cast , the film suffers from constant confusion . Why was that art dealer killed ? Would we actually think that an elderly Holocaust survivor was trying to fool people with the Veneer portrait ? Do we have to be told that villain Philip Casnoff is thrown off the helicopter he flees to ? Since when does a blonde dish have the name of Agnes ? What an art investigator she is ! Lea Thompson directed and starred in this mess as a housewife who goes on student field trips and also doubles as a secret agent . The mixing of the two is hard to believe as well as realize here . Thompson always has that bit of anger on her face when she is acting . I can't blame her here given the material that she has to work with . Joe Penny , as the cop Frank , is taken in by Agnes , Elaine Hendrix , and he looks entirely confused by all this . Nice seeing William R . Moses in the part of Thompson's husband . Remember him in Perry Mason ? I always wondered what became of him . He is given so little to do in this film .
420445	2542703	45866	4.0	Here Come the Girls - Thank Heaven for Them	Inane Bob Hope farce where the Great Bob portrays Snodgrass , a jerk who has only succeeded at failure in his life . He gets the show business bug and of course he is completely inept . He is about to get the heave ho in 1900 New York , until a serial N . Y . killer is bitterly jealous of co-star Arlene Dahl and her lover Tony Martin . Unknowingly , Hope is put in as a decoy for Martin and there are some hilarious moments . Rosemary Clooney is the girl who really loves him . Unfortunately , both Clooney and Martin have little to do here except sing some ditties , none of which ever became memorable .
420385	2542703	65400	4.0	The Angel Levine Unsettling and Morally Tragic	I was very disappointed in this 1970 film based on a Bernard Malamud story . This is basically a story of possible redemption , racial bias and the unfulfillment of life based on mistrust . A black Jewish angel is sent to help a struggling tailor and his critically ill wife . If Morris Mishkin ( Zero Mostel ) will only believe in the angel ( Belafonte ) , his wife Fanny ( Ida Kaminska ) will recover . The problem is that Morris has basically given up on life and just refuses to believe that Belafonte is an angel . When he believes it , Fanny improves but in the end he has doubts and Fanny suffers accordingly . It would have been very nice if there had been an English translation in the last scene when a dying Fanny speaks to Morris . Jan Kadar , who successfully directed Miss Kaminska in her Oscar nominated brilliant performance in 1966's " The Shop on Main Street " directs this film as well . Kaminska is reduced in the film to mostly bed scenes and her kindness in her speech really doesn't convey the desperate situation that she faces . She keeps calling for Ruthie , their daughter , who disobeyed them by marrying out of the Jewish religion . For most of the film , she does not realize the Angel's appearance in her apartment . The scene in the pharmacy is muddled and the scene where the Angel's girl friend confronts Belafonte in their apartment , is memorable but all too brief . We don't know why Belafonte is in danger and why he has died . Those viewing this film must have left the theater in a state of depression and desperation .
420918	2542703	37365	4.0	The Thin Man Goes Home - Should Have Stayed Away	Nick and Nora Charles go home to see his parents . Myrna Loy and William Powell were usually wonderful as the detective and his lovable wife . The script does them in in this film . Supported by the usually elderly looking Harry Davenport and his wife , veteran actress Lucile Watson add really nothing to the plot . Naturally , they have no vacation as they're soon thrown into investigating a murder that occurred at their parents ' doorstep . We soon find an array of suspects to deal with . We have Crazy Mary who loves to knock people over the head with any object in her reach . The wonderful Anne Revere plays the part and says so little . She is dressed up as if she is Apple Annie from " Pocketful of Miracles " fame . Donald Meek , Edward Brophy , Leon Ames and a very young Gloria De Haven round out the fine cast . By the way , what was behind those paintings being sold ? This is never fully explained and that might just be what's wrong with this picture . You'll laugh at the beginning when Nick and Nora are trying to move about in a very crowded corridor of the train . You will be reminded of the Marx Brothers in " Room Service . " When a very fat man comes the opposite way , you will laugh heartily . Other than this , there is very little to smile to .
420735	2542703	39589	4.0	Lured - Don't Be Enticed	Pretty bad film with George Sanders and Lucille Ball starring . Their chemistry is about non-existent . This is supposed to be a murder thriller and for a change there is absolutely no violence shown as 7 women fall victim to a mysterious killer . Charles Coburn is the inspector of Scotland Yard yet he has no British accent . Lucille Ball plays a dancer doing odd jobs who works as a decoy for the Yard when one of her friends mysteriously disappears and eventually shown to fallen victim to this maniacal killer . Ball is essentially Lucy without the laughs . Despite what others say , she shows absolutely no dramatic flare here at all . I expected Ethel and Fred Mertz to intervene at any time to save the day . It becomes so obvious who the killer is . Sir Cedric Hardwicke , who was so good in " The Ten Commandments " and memorable as Henry Cabot Lodge in " Wilson , " looks like a real odd-ball here . The ending is predictable even with Sanders , the lover of Ball , in the film confessing guilt to draw the real killer out .
420668	2542703	31762	4.0	Only Angels Have Wings - A Devil of A Film	Cary Grant is terribly miscast as Jeff Carter , who heads a mail flying outfit out in an area filled with bad weather . Jean Arthur comes off the boat and falls for Grant . What else is new ? Grant looks ridiculous in a sombrero like hat and is always asking for a light . Even a bigger joke is his sidekick Thomas Mitchell . The latter is called The Kid . Some kid . This is the same year that Mitchell starred as Gerald O'Hara in the true classic " Gone With the Wind . " He also copped a supporting Oscar that year for " Stagecoach . " After Noah Beery Jr . is killed in bad weather , the group goes around a piano and Grant and Miss Arthur lead them in an absolutely awful rendition of " Some of these Days . " Where was Sophie Tucker when she was badly needed ? Arthur loves Grant so much that she points a gun at him and when she places it down on the table , the gun offs off popping Cary in the arm . The writer of this nonsense needed some popping as well . Of course , the characters become resolute at the end . Cary flies off and Jean will be waiting for him . The other thing they needed to wait for was much better projects than this which thankfully they got in the years ahead .
420741	2542703	416508	4.0	This Film Does Not Become Jane	Stop with tales of Jane Austen already . They are constantly boring with everyone spewing forth his own philosophy . Obviously , this definite period piece tries to overdo the mannerisms and tenets of a long bygone era . As the players say , they live in a period where it is believed that a wife who has a brain is dangerous . James McAvoy , the lover of Austen , played well by Ann Hathaway , is too young for the part . He has that boyish look which seems inappropriate . It is only at the end of the film , when the years have passed , that he seems to come into his own . As the erudite , manipulative and crusty old aunt , Maggie Smith gives a gem of a performance as this fine character actress always does . Jane Austen never married . Let's keep it that way and not do anymore movies on a spinster who lived in a different era .
420428	2542703	33477	4.0	Come Live With Me-Move Away from this One	To paraphrase : " When you wed , you don't have to know that much about your partner , but when you're getting a divorce , you should learn about them . " This is basically what this film is about and it is as foolish as my first sentence . The plot sounds good . A woman who escapes Nazi controlled Austria must marry an American or face deportation . This is the problem facing Hedy Lamarr but she can't make the most of it due to the inept writing . They certainly could have made her romance James Stewart more during the week she had before facing being removed . Instead , she merely weds Stewart quickly . After they're wed , her lover then decides to divorce his wife so that he can be free to marry her . Why in heaven's name didn't he do this before her marriage to Stewart . Going up to grandma's house at the end of this film does nothing either . Grandma's house is full of proverbs . One of them should have read " Much Ado About Nothing ! "
421155	2542703	1042877	5.0	Cadillac Records Doesn't Exactly Ride the High Country	The music is fascinating but it's still the same old story in movie land . A group of guys make it big in the record industry in the 1950s and mayhem results . Yes , it's the old story of what success can lead to . Adrien Brody has the lead role of Len Chess , a Jewish guy whose parents came from Poland . The last time we heard Poland mentioned in a movie , Brody won the Oscar for " The Pianist . " Brody certainly needs to have gone to a smoking cessation clinic after this film . This guy can really put those cigarettes away . While I imagine that Len Chess was a heavy smoker , it becomes very disgusting and poignant as Chess died of a massive heart attack at age 37 . There is the usual screaming , violence and killing in this picture as you can imagine . Beyonce Knowles is wonderful as the drug-addicted Etta James . She belts out AT LAST in a phenomenal way .
421565	2542703	219965	5.0	Bandits-Crime Does Pay But Never So Nicely	Bruce Willis and Billy Bob Thornton teamed up as bank robbers in this 2001 farce . Thornton plays an intellectual hypochondriac who nonetheless would kill if he had to . Willis is a care-free guy . After escaping from an Oregon prison , the two go on quite a spree , where they invade the homes of bank officials and stay overnight and then take them the following morning to rob the place . Their escapades are absolutely real . The police and bank officials are made to look foolish in the eyes of those viewing this film . Bored and upset with her husband , Cate Blanchett meets up with this dynamic duo and becomes a member of the gang in the way that Patty Hearst did as well as Estelle Parsons in " Bonnie & Clyde . " Unlike Parsons , Blanchett becomes attracted to both of these guys . Their final caper is one for the books and would leave us all saying that crime does pay . Not really as it's really not worth paying to see these fools create themselves as legendary heroes . A good point is that the film lacks violence and in some ways becomes a comical tribute to film bank robbers .
420886	2542703	43992	5.0	Sante Fe - Westward Slow	Wonderful premise where 4 brothers , after the civil war , go different directions with the elder brother , Randolph Scott , working for the railroad and the other 3 wind up as bank robbers . The film becomes muddled as you really don't understand the conflict between the various factions within the railroad . You also don't know how to feel about the brothers . Are they victims of circumstances ? What was the fate of the surviving brothers by film's end ? Roy Roberts plays the villain here . I remember him as a hotel innkeeper who refused admission to Gregory Peck for being Jewish in " Gentleman's Agreement , " and 20 years later to a black couple in " Hotel . " This is a great part for Randolph Scott . He is a real good guy here , and yet still loyal to the concept of family .
420998	2542703	41967	5.0	Tokyo Joe - Not the Same Old Story	This certainly was not one of Humphrey Bogart's best films ? Why ? There is very little action in it . When the action does occur , it is so quickly resolved . The end is predictable because after all , Florence Marly ( Trina ) can't have two husbands . What did the Baron really want to smuggle in ? Just some Communists to stir things up , or was there even more to this ? Alexander Knox is terribly miscast as Bob Landis , Tina's second husband . He is drab and needed to exert much more if he wanted his wife back all together . Surprising that after such a brilliant performance in 1944's " Wilson " that Knox got stuck with this part . The part called for a much more suave type . Knox totally lacked appeal here and it's showing . The ending really ends with a question mark . However , we know how it had to end . A " Casablanca " this certainly is not .
420521	2542703	58557	5.0	Seance on A Wet Afternoon-Soak it Up	Kim Stanley and Richard Attenborough gave fine performances in this eerie film about a dysfunctional couple , she is a seer , who meticulously plan a kidnapping . Miss Stanley is the epitome of evil . She evokes eerie images each time she is on the screen . Soft spoken and sinister , Kim Stanley gave a masterful performance as Mrs . Savage . Though she lost the Oscar , she did capture the N . Y . C . Film Critics Award . Evenly matched by Richard Attenborough's excellent portrayal of her milque-toast husband , who is reluctant to do this , both thespians gave unforgettable performances . The problem though is the film itself . Shot in black and white , Ms . Stanley's character does come off as a complete nut job . When he reads the ransom note to her , it's almost comical in nature .
420450	2542703	31756	5.0	On Your Toes is Off the Mark and is Slaughtered	Once again Zorina proved that she was not the person for being Maria in " For Whom the Bell Tolls . " Nice to have seen what the late Donald O'Connor looked like as a boy . I knew it was him and was just waiting for cast confirmation at the end of the film . The film would have been better had James Gleason and Queenie Smith , the parents of the boy , been given larger parts . The film deals with a vaudeville couple and their son in an act . The boy eventually decides to write music instead and has grown up in the person of Eddie Albert . Albert is pretty good on his feet . The problem with this film is the writing . Albert soon gets involved with a Russian troupe and writes The Slaughter on 10th Avenue Ballet . The head of the ballet is a comic Alan Hale who wants some Russian killed . There are Russian mobsters to do the job . When Hale becomes jealous of Albert , he tells the mobsters that he is the Russian to be killed . There are some hilarious ballet sequences and Zorina does show that she was meant to be a ballet star .
420554	2542703	783233	5.0	Thou Shall Atone For Your Sins , How About this Picture ?	A young girl's lie forever alters the destiny of her sister and the latter's boy friend . This is what we are told in the advertising for the best picture nominee of 2007 - " Atonement . " The director should atone for giving us this kind of picture . We are dealing with nothing more than a little brat who accused her sister's boy friend of molesting a younger cousin of theirs . The story would have been far more exciting if the class angle issue would have been emphasized instead . The lad accused of the molestation was the son of a cook in the house . Despite his education and ambition to become a doctor , no one believed him , probably because of class distinction , and as a result he suffered imprisonment . The picture alternately fast forwards and goes back to make its point . The ending is most shocking , when some 40 + years later , the girl is now an elderly woman , portrayed by the venerable hag Vanessa Redgrave . As a child , Briony loved to write and it was probably her precocious attitude that stirred her imagination . Redgrave admits to the fact that the book that she has written was a take off on the lives of the young man and her sister , both of whom , really had died during World War 11 . She is atoning for her sin in writing the book of how their lives should have been . Of all people to play a person atoning for her sins , Vanessa Redgrave ! That witch should be atoning for her 1978 presence at the Oscars , when after winning for best supporting actress in " Julia , " she delivered her diatribe against Zionism . Practice what you preach Vanessa and atone for first things first . As for the movie , it is an utterly boring and is so slow paced , that it could have been told in half an hour .
421577	2542703	410400	5.0	On A Clear Day - Cloud this up to Me	An Irish couple have secrets after years of marriage . She is aspiring to pass a test to drive a bus and he wants to swim the English Channel . It takes nearly the entire movie to explain that the family had a swimming tragedy years before . Brenda Blethyn , so wonderful in " Secrets and Lies , " and " Little Voice " is the mother here . Sorry , Miss Blethyn this is not the former film here . The father has an assortment of friends who are basically insecure . Of course , his successful conquest of the channel will change all that . They also have a married son who is unemployed with twin boys . With thick Irish accents , it is often difficult to understand what the characters are trying to say . As an example , Miss Blethyn states and I say it phonetically - " I joost faeled mi buz tezt . " Jump for joy when the major swim and the film are over and the credits begin to roll .
421396	2542703	430105	5.0	4 Brothers - Where's the Beef ?	The plot of this potentially excellent movie is short-circuited by the writing . Why did the gang go after Mrs . Mercer like that ? The woman was shot down like an animal . The wonderful Mrs . Mercer , who took in 4 youths that no one ever wanted comes to an end like this . You have to wonder . The four adopted sons reunite and naturally begin to ask questions why this happened . At first , it appeared that old Mrs . Mercer was in the wrong place at the wrong time . Too much starts to come out about corrupt Detroit police , and elected local officials . It just doesn't bother to explain why all this is occurring . The chase scenes , especially the one in the snowstorm was filmed quite well .
420957	2542703	48705	5.0	Don't Fall for A Tender Trap	Disappointing inane farce with an all-star cast . Frank Sinatra plays his usual swinging self . As a theatrical agent , he has a supply of women around including Lola Albright and Carolyn Jones . Both are completely wasted here . Jones was much better , when she starred 4 years later with Sinatra , in 1959's A Hole in the Head . Debbie Reynolds tries to play the prim and proper Julie , who has her life planned out for her . She falls for Sinatra . Celeste Holm tries to show comic flair by playing a musician-another love interest of Sinatra . Frankie becomes engaged to both Holm and Reynolds at the same time-you would think this would make for an hilarious situation . It doesn't and is quickly resolved . David Wayne , a wonderful under-rated actor , plays Sinatra's married and want-to-be swinging pal who has left his wife of 11 years along with his 3 children . He falls for Holm as well . Naturally , this story resolves itself at the end . Was it really worth the effort ? Sinatra-Reynolds-Holm and Wayne come out on the screen at the end to sing the title song . Holm and Wayne hold hands despite the fact that Wayne returns to his wife and Holm conveniently marries a British resident who resides in the same building as Sinatra . How coincidental .
420825	2542703	411061	5.0	88 Minutes Might Really Be A Class Act	It isn't as bas as some people are saying . It's not an Oscar winner but Slumdog Millionaire wasn't either . Al Pacino , as always , delivers a good performance , this time as a forensic psychiatrist caught up in murder and forced to relive the brutal slaying of his younger sister years before . The title has something to do with that . Nice seeing William Forsythe playing a nice guy for a change , that is , on the right side of the law . You have to see the film to understand why I bring in class act into the mix . The premise is not that outrageous . After all , what some of these lawyers wouldn't do ! As is the usual case with this type of film , the bodies begin to pile up and we have lots of turns and twists where even Pacino is suspected of causing all the mayhem . Takes place in a rainy Seattle . What else is new ?
421468	2542703	388500	6.0	Beauty Shop Provides Thin Cut	Queen Latifah opens a beauty shop after her big argument with her boss . Latifah is kind , intelligent but just plain out of luck . Kevin Bacon steals the film in his role as the gay boss with a thick German accent . Wearing his blond wig , Bacon is hilarious in a performance that should have been considered for best supporting actor . The women and man hairstylist have a comment for everything and everyone but the film just seems to meander about . The writers should have remained focused on Latifah's relationship with the evil Bacon , who conspires with the State Board to ruin her after she takes business away from him . An aging Della Reese has a wasted one scene role as a high class woman entering the shop . Miss Reese was offered few lines and disappears rapidly . Alfre Woodard , as one of the stylists , is effective in her common talk but no nonsense approach .
420788	2542703	30442	6.0	Merrily or Silly Live We	Very familiar plot to " My Man Godfrey " regarding butlers in upper class society . Oscar nominee Billie Burke is a complete ditz in this film . As an upper class matron , she can't remember much and cracks such lines as to the chauffeur : " Do you drive ? " To a U . S . senator : " The last time I visited Washington it was for a coronation . " Her eldest daughter played with a sexy sarcasm , by Constance Bennett appears much older than her 2 movie siblings-Bonita Granville and Tom Brown . In most scenes , she looks like their parents ! The plot really gets going when the butler , who is about to be fired ( Brian Aherne ) is mistaken for one of the dinner guests and becomes romantically entangled with the visiting senator's daughter . This gets Bennett jealous . Patsy Kelly's comedic gifts are not taken to full advantage here . Some funny moments but the plot and outcome are so predictable .
421265	2542703	414993	6.0	The Fountain She Studied Science in Junior High School	Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz are well cast in this film . Their acting is quite good but in reality , what are they really trying to achieve here ? The film has its good moments when it is up-to-date with a dedicated doctor desperately trying to save his wife from a fatal brain tumor . The ancient scenes are absolutely ridiculous and are even laugh-worthy . Discussing tree of life , problems in Spain et al could have been avoided here . Veteran pro Ellen Burstyn as Dr . Lillian provides some good moments as an understanding doctor in a world of reality but her role is wasted here . Perhaps , it would have been more exciting to bring another exorcism in here . Jackman's line that death is a disease is a catchy one . Only in the end does he accept some form of reality . As for Ms . Weisz stating that she studied science in junior high school , my high school chemistry teacher would take umbrage at that . Life , as we know it , sure isn't a bowl of cherries as this film wisely depicts .
420624	2542703	46806	6.0	Bridges of Toko-Ri is A Bridge to Nowhere	Imagine , Grace Kelly won the Oscar in 1954 for " The Country Girl . " Bill Holden costarred with her in that film and in this one , he plays her husband . Amazing that Miss Kelly did not have a major role in this film . This is really nothing more than a routine film again dealing with the subject of the futility of war . Holden plays a Colorado attorney who has been brought back for service in the Korean War . Fredric March , the commander is stoic throughout the film . How he relates to Grace Kelly in this film is quite puzzling . He tells her of the fact that he lost 2 sons in war-time and that his wife has gone off . Perhaps , he serves as the intermediary to prepare her for the tragedy that lies ahead . No matter what , it is an eerie performance . Mickey Rooney provides some comic relief in his role as a helicopter pilot who is ready to fight all of Tokyo when his Japanese girlfriend abandons him for another serviceman . We expect more from the film , which in my opinion is a major disappointment . There are some excellent aerial scenes .
420895	2542703	48744	6.0	Viva Villa But Not Necessarily this Film	Shelley Winters in a typical western yarn set at the time of the uprising of the fiery Mexican Revolutionary Pancho Villa . Gilbert Roland , as Castro , another fiery revolutionary is fascinating to watch . He has these types of parts well under his grip . Even the use of the word gringo can't be said better by anyone . Gold is taken from a train to aid the revolution . Western star , Rory Calhoun , comes along for the ride as a American soldier of fortune , and Miss Winters portrays a woman of virtuous ideals , and full of love as well . This is a story of betrayal and redemption . The love triangle is there but is certainly not dominant in this film . Yes , there is lust and greed but it's revolution time !
420629	2542703	44751	6.0	Invitation Could Have Been More Inviting	Routine film involving father Louis Calhern's over protective approach for his ailing daughter . Not only isn't she told that she has a year left to live , Daddy Calhern uses his wealth to marry her off to Dan Pierce . ( Van Johnson ) The film would have worked better had it not been for the Ruth Roman part of Maud , the girl next door , who lost out on Johnson and never lets Ellen ( Dorothy McGuire ) forget it . Between this and finding a book , Ellen soon finds out what is going on . A series of flashbacks shows how Dan wooed her and the supposed happiness they found during their 10 months of supposed wedded bliss . The acting is quite good here , especially McGuire's Ellen . She is soft spoken at times and reminded me of Kathy , her Oscar nominated performance of 5 years before , in the memorable " Gentleman's Agreement . " She pulls out all the stops when she finds out what is really going on . Roman's Maud is a nasty character . She will do anything to get back her lover Dan , even if it means telling Ellen that she will die soon . The film goes down in quality once Ellen knows what is going on . It is with the change of season that we know that love has triumphed and all shall end well as the end flashes on the screen .
421566	2542703	50682	7.0	Man on Fire - Give the Kid A Break !	Definitely a forerunner to " Kramer vs . Kramer " with Bing Crosby starring as a father who has custody of his young son . His wife ( Mary Fickett ) divorced him years ago for a Washington political person . Crosby is a successful businessman who has a wonderful relationship with his son . Enter mom and her husband who want custody of the child . Anne Seymour , in a one-scene restrained performance , plays the judge who surprises everyone with her decision to give the boy to his mother since the child has no ties with her . An embittered Crosby goes on a brief binge while being consoled by Inger Stevens , an assistant to his attorney played by the usual movie-lawyer E . G . Marshall . The film is interesting and well acted by all but my flaw with it is that the child is constantly bounced around as Crosby and Fickett fight it out . In addition , the Solomon-like decision did not apply here . If we remember our bible , the woman who was willing to see Solomon divide the child really didn't love the child at all , if she wanted this to happen . In the film , the mother finally relents as she sees that the child really wants to stay with his father and therefore , in the tradition of Solomon , she loves the child more . This is wrong and the writers of this picture should have read the bible more carefully . Naturally , everyone comes to his senses in this one by the end as a reasonable solution is obtained . One could question why this solution couldn't be put forth at the beginning of the controversy . Nevertheless , the film shows insight in its discussing the effects of divorce on children , the anger of one parent in particular and that a child should remain with the female parent . Yet , haven't we come a long way in equality for both parents ?
421529	2542703	70510	7.0	Paper Moon Proves that It's A Barnum & Bailey World	Depression era film with Ryan and Tatum O'Neil as two terrific con artists . How could Tatum have won for best supporting actress ? She is nearly every scene in the film and steals the show for sure . Amazing that she was able to beat out Madeleine Kahn's Trixie Delight in that category . You really get a feeling for the depression from what the film depicts . When Addie ( Tatum ) stares with that icy expression , you know you're vulnerable to just about everything . What makes the film so good is the bonding between Ryan and Tatum . Since they're father and daughter in real life , this helped the situation . It was that very bond that brings them together at film's end .
420326	2542703	483726	7.0	Man of the Year - A Joke to the Chief !	While watching this film , I was saying to myself that it would become better when it would become more serious . That is exactly what happened . The problem with the film is that we were stuck with Robin Williams ' corny jokes . He plays a comedian who seeks the presidency and by some fluke wins . As far as the fluke goes , does this sound familiar ? Yes , he runs on a platform of integrity and ignoring the needs of special interest groups . As with too many candidates of today , he is quite vague on complex issues . The film vastly improves when it is discovered that a computer error has pushed him into the presidency . When Laura Linney , as Eleanor Green , an employer with the computer company brings this out , she is discredited in the usual discredited sort of way . Of course , Williams admits on a comedy news show that he shouldn't be president-elect after all . He now becomes even more famous on the comedy circuit because he has shown true integrity . Did the writers of this film ably do so ? The usually sinister Christopher Walken sheds that image and portrays an adviser to Williams or Dobbs as the candidate's name is in this film .
420829	2542703	364603	7.0	Plain Song Not Exactly Missing Themes	Interesting but too many plots bring this film down . We have a teacher who is pressured to pass a miserable child so that they can get him out of the school despite the fact that the brat assaulted the teacher . The teacher ( Aidan Quinn ) has a wife who has left him , apparently suffering from depression and has gone to her sister in Denver . There are 2 young polite boys from the marriage who eventually find an old lady dead in her apartment . They deliver the paper to her and never bother to report that the woman , who lost her son in Korea , has died . The boys get caught up with that miserable student , who has bigoted parents . If this isn't enough , we have America Fererra , who has been abandoned by her mother when it is determined that she is pregnant . She goes to live with 2 older gentlemen who have kept to themselves following the deaths of their parents . They are recommended by the teacher in the next room who has romantic visions on Quinn . The school secretary also has an eye on this man . Yes , the movie is interesting but the themes abound . Each character could have developed into a story by itself . Was the teacher motivating the student ? The pressure that teachers are faced with to pass students according to their supervisors is another theme . The depression of the mother . The life of the old woman ( Marion Seldes ) and the 2 older gentlemen who find they can contribute to life . I could go on and on .
421089	2542703	332047	7.0	Pitch One For Fever Pitch	Jimmy Fallon and Drew Barrymore sparkle in this delightful comedy about comedy and baseball . Instilled with the love of the Boston Red Sox from childhood , Fallon grows up to become a high school math teacher . He brings his students to a company where Miss Barrymore works and the two fall instantly in love . It's a shame that the kids that he brought were not used more in this film . All goes well until Barrymore is beaned by a foul ball . Their romance begins to hit the skids as does this picture , for in one scene , Fallon is talking about his sexual life with Barrymore to a student during school baseball practice . This was inappropriate but silly . Of course , love conquers all and by the end , we have a championship for the Sox , thereby ending the curse of the bambino . Stay with this film . Barrymore is perky and suits the role to a tee . Nice to see Marissa Jaret Winokur of " Hairspray " fame in this flick . Just too bad that nothing is made of her part . This talented thespian should be given better starring roles in the future .
420954	2542703	326905	7.0	Great Raid Does Justice to the Big Screen	Very good telling of a raid led to free American prisoners of war in the Philippines at the end of World War 11 . The Japanese are depicted for their savage treatment of American prisoners . We see random shootings and other atrocities committed by a military induced society . The characters are not given the opportunity to develop since this is wartime . The ending sequence showing liberation pictures is heartwarming and a credit to the human spirit . We salute those who sacrificed so much so that others could enjoy freedom .
420595	2542703	42771	7.0	Mystery Street is A Taut Thriller	Jan Sterling is a pick up lady who is pregnant . When she calls the father , he blows her away in a secluded area . Problem is that Marshall Thompson is on a drunken binge following the death of his son during childbirth . Sterling lures Thompson into his car and then steals it . When she is killed , the killer ditches the car and several months later Sterling's skeleton is found along with the awfully wet car . Excellent detective work by cop Ricardo Montalban and as a Harvard professor turned sleuth Bennett leads to the arrest of Thompson , thus destroying his life with his wife , nicely played by Sally Forest . Elsa Lanchester steals the movie as a snoopy , vicious landlady , whose greed shall lead to her demise as well . Well done picture by showing how the real killer is caught at the end . This is film noir at its very best .
421187	2542703	901693	7.0	Staircase Murders - Watch Your Step Please	Treat Williams gives another excellent performance in this true story about a supposedly successful writer on trial for the murder of his second wife . Did he or didn't he kill her by the staircase and make it look like an accidental drunken fall ? Williams does best when he is the victim of accusations . His sinister performance is remarkably done . Did anyone ever bother to question why the other woman who met her death on a staircase 18 years before looked so good when her body was dug up ? This is also a story of strong family relationships . It depicts how part of that relationship begins to break up as the evidence begins to pile up . A footnote to all this is that one should never start rejoicing with their attorney until the verdict is announced .
420346	2542703	465417	7.0	Living With the Enemy - With Husbands Like This	A beautiful Sarah Lancaster stars in this unusual movie . Mr . Humphrey ( Philip Lauder ) shows a profile similar to John Edwards . As an assistant to an executive , Allison finds the love of her life - any woman would find this handsome hunk a gem , as he is a billionaire . His firm , Cobalt , is amazing . After a day of whirlwind romance , they wed and the fun begins . He brings her home to an estate run by his alcoholic vicious sister who thinks she is an older version of Dorothy Malone's Oscar winning performance in " Written on the Wind . " I thought that this sister would be another Mrs . Danvers of " Rebecca " fame . Allison also sees that the house is like a fortress and she is given rules to live by the security agency that guards her . Turns out that Phil Lauder was married twice before . Wife # 2 was kidnapped and found dead . While walking on the street , Allison is pulled away by the FBI . She finds that Phil is under investigation for shady dealings-anyone opposing Cobalt seems to meet a sudden , nasty end . Look out for a sinister attorney-friend , the real culprit . The end is rather satisfying as we realize that Allison has become another Cinderella . It's another fairy-tale ending .
420941	2542703	44431	7.0	Bloodhounds Has A Fairly Good Smell Over Broadway	Mitzi Gaynor and Scott Brady starred in this 1952 Damon Runyon tale involving gangsters and some good people . When Brady is returning from Florida , as the heat from the commission investigating him has been turned off , he runs into Georgia hick Mitzi Gaynor . Feeling sorry for her , this bookie brings her back to New York only to realize that she is a 20 year old girl . He sets her up for dancing and naturally being Mitzi Gaynor , she succeeds . As he falls in love with her , he will incur the wrath of his jealous girl who will turn the tables on him . Gaynor was just wonderful in her dance sequences . Mitzi Green is in fine form in a supporting performance as the mob's moll who helps both Gaynor and Brady as the two fall for each other . Very light and amusing entertainment . Look for 2 brief scenes by Charles Bronson as a mobster . Milo O'Shea handles his role as a police officer effectively .
421122	2542703	39054	8.0	Two Sisters from Boston Rates	Nice turn of the century film where Kathryn Grayson comes to N . Y . to sing in a joint . Her presence there threatens a scandal in her native Boston as her uncle is the Republican candidate for mayor of the town . He comes with his wife to investigate and the fun starts . June Allyson is her sister and Jimmy Durante , the owner of the place where Grayson is singing . To save Grayson , Durante arranges for her to sing at the opera with the established Lauritz Melchior . Peter Lawford , falls for Allyson but thinks that Grayson is having an affair with his father . The picture becomes funny at times but needed technicolor to brighten it up . Ben Blue is funny as a drunken waiter and Melchior shows some comedic gift here . A pleasant film capturing the turn of the century musical traditions in America .
421640	2542703	308055	8.0	Bobby - Should Have Kept Bobbin ' Along	Film detailing the problems confronting the U . S . in 1968 and that fateful day and night at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles , where Robert F . Kennedy was shot and killed after winning the California primary . The film deals with a variety of characters and situations at the Ambassador . The film also mirrors the problems of the 1960s , drug addiction , boredom in retirement which isn't something new , Alzheimer's phenomenon , racial relations , marital woes and of course the Vietnam War with a set wedding so that the groom can avoid Vietnam service . Demi Moore gives an interesting performance as a nightclub singer at the hotel caught up with an addiction to alcohol . In a way , she resembles Anne Bancroft's Mrs . Robinson in " The Graduate " of the year before . It's just the way she stretches those legs . Is she supposed to resemble Rosemarie Clooney who was there that fateful night and was never the same after the shooting ? Anthony Hopkins is in fine form as a retired worker at the hotel who meets with an increasingly forgetful Harry Belafonte . William H . Macy plays the cheating husband who discharges an employee only for the latter to squeal about his affair with a hotel switchboard operator . Laurence Fishburne attempts to explain black accommodation to the hostile Latino employees at the hotel . All the stories shall inter-connect at the time of the shooting . A bold attempt to depict the social problems of the 1960s .
421550	2542703	39208	8.0	Boomerang Makes A Sharp Turn	Interesting cast makes this 1947 film intriguing . Elia Kazan directs this complex drama regarding the shooting of an elderly priest on the street . The weakness here was that the reason why the culprit killed the man of the church was never fully adequately explained . Nice to see Karl Malden and Lee J . Cobb in this film . Kazan would use them again 7 years later in " On the Waterfront . " Dana Andrews seems quite subdued here . He has given us much better performances through the years . Jane Wyatt's role is wasted . Her possible innocent involvement in Ed Begley's scheme is not fully developed . The film is also interesting as it shows that the reformers in government have plenty of skeletons in their closets as well . Forced confessions have always been a major problem in crime enforcement . Still another weakness in the film was Dana Andrews literally turning on the witnesses to the crime . While they deserved it , this wasn't adequately explained either .
421316	2542703	39536	8.0	Kiss of Death Makes You Wonder	Even though he saw his gangster father cut down by police bullets , you have to wonder how a kind hearted , sympathetic character as Nick Bianco , well played by Victor Mature , settled down to a life of crime . In addition , was there anything going on with Nick and the babysitter while Nick's wife was living ? They sure teamed up quickly and Nick remarried very fast after his wife's suicide . Despite these possible flaws , we have an engrossing film dealing with a gangster must face when he starts squealing on fellow mob members . Of course , Richard Widmark steals the movie with his performance of the insane hooligan with that memorable laugh , eerie smile and depraved indifference to human life . Throwing a wheel-chair bound Mildred Dunnock down the stairs was most shocking . It would take a performance such as the one given by Edmund Gwenn in the family tradition film , " Miracle on 34th St . " to defeat Widmark . Ironically , Widmark was never Oscar nominated again .
421557	2542703	104265	8.0	Final Analysis - You'll Enjoy this Evaluation	When viewing this film , I thought that Alfred Hitchcock had returned to film making . A marvelous , intriguing film dealing with a psychiatrist who becomes involved with the sister of his patient . Unfortunately , he is unaware of their diabolical scheme . As a gangster husband of Kim Bassinger , Eric Roberts is quite effective in this role . Ms . Bassinger has one of her best roles and turns in a powerhouse performance as a deeply disturbed woman whose diabolical scheme is unimaginable . She uses psychiatric data to justify murdering her husband , and if things don't go her way , she can always blame her sister's psychiatrist , played by Gere , who gives a restrained but compelling performance .
421124	2542703	114148	8.0	Pocahantas Gets Her Man ?	Wonderfully animated film , even if they distort history . Too bad the anti-Semite Mel Gibson had to play John Smith . A better role that would have been suited for that misery would have been Gov . Radcliffe . Back to the film , which is an interesting one , it depicts the basic reason for war-greed . The music is carefree and great . All sing well . As Willow , the Tree , Linda Hunt is impressive . ( She usually is . ) Too bad that the father's choice for Pocahantas had to catch a bullet . The way the film turned out , they really didn't have to kill him off that way . After all , we are dealing with a younger audience .
420548	2542703	102945	9.0	Sleeping With the Enemy - A Rude Wide Awakening	This abusive husband is just too much and as a result , wife Julia Roberts fakes her own drowning just to escape . When a fellow swimmer calls to pay his condolences the maniacal husband becomes suspicious . Seems that Julia never learned to swim . By a series of conniving ways , our fiend finds out where his wife has gone . She has settled in a small town in Iowa and attempted to make a life of her own . She even told her husband that her blind stroke victim mother had died when in reality she had her moved to another home in Minnesota . Julia finds love in the way of a college teacher . There is one funny line when the husband puts a gun to the head of a drama teacher . It can be him since he is in a relationship with another guy . The ending will tell you just how miserable Julia was when she makes the phone call to police . It also tells you that getting papers to keep these fiends away is nothing more than worthless . This film is exciting and nicely paced . How the husband finds out the whereabouts of his wife is also fascinating .
421532	2542703	65206	9.0	Whatever Happened to Aunt Alice ? Pure Fun for the Rest of Us	A definite film of the macabre again proving that there was no one like Geraldine Page for these neurotic , vicious parts . In this one , Ruth Gordon takes a job as a maid in Page's home under false pretenses . It seems that Gordon had a disagreement with her long time domestic , played by Mildred Dunnock . In a huff , Dunnock walked out and went to work for Page . Seems that Page has quite a history . Once she finds out that her maids have no family , she does them in quite neatly . Throughout the film you constantly are hearing Page yelling Mrs . Dimmock to maid Gordon , as she begins to suspect that Gordon is no usual maid . The film takes place in the desert of Arizona which seems to place a peculiar and effective aura to the film . The ending is an absolute knockout .
421500	2542703	340380	9.0	Straight from the Heart -	This is a wonderfully realized television movie starring Teri Polo and Andrew McCarthy . McCarthy , as the embittered widower , sullen and angry with life , shows that he has become a masterful matured actor . He has really graduated from the days of the college or high school teen movies that he starred in years back . What makes this film so good is the way that the McCarthy character and Teri Polo gradually fall in love . How they get together is interesting enough . His sister writes an ad for her brother to meet someone , Polo's friend is upset that her friend's 5 year romance seems to be going nowhere and answers the ad for her friend . This brings about the Polo trip to the west where she immediately shows McCarthy that she can handle a rural life as well as his apparent insults . This is a heartwarming tale featuring the animals on the farm and an embittered father-in-law who blames McCarthy for his daughter's death after she gives birth to a baby girl who also dies .
421351	2542703	43667	9.0	A Mountain Worthy to Climb	William Lundigan and Susan Hayward starred in this 1951 film regarding the trials and tribulations of a preacher and his wife . The scenery was truly beautiful in the part of Georgia where the film was made . Alexander Knox , so memorable in 1944's Wilson , steals the film in another wonderful performance as the dirt farmer , a non-believer , whose child drowns accidentally while under Hayward and Lundigan's care . That scene in itself will just tug at your heart . A film of the human spirit beautifully realized by Lundigan and Hayward .
420641	2542703	51193	9.0	Wild is the Wonderful Wind	When Johnny Mathis sings the opening theme to this film , you know you're in for a treat . Mathis does not let you down . Anna Magnani is brought to America by her new husband , played memorably by Anthony Quinn . It seems that Quinn was married to Magnani's sister Rosa . Rosa wrote Magnani of the wonderful life she had with him . Unfortunately , Rosa dies . This is a tragedy for Magnani because she falls into a marriage from hell with Quinn . Things go from bad to worse . Magnani , in a fine performance , screams that Rosa is dead ! Naturally , Anthony Franciosa , as a cowhand on the ranch , really makes things interesting . Franciosa merited a supporting nomination here . Ironically , he was vying with Quinn for the best actor Oscar that year . Franciosa was up for " A Hatful of Rain . " Quinn and Magnani were Oscar nominated for their strong powerful performances . It was wonderful seeing Magnani sing in her native Italian . Subtitles should have been in the film at the beginning since only Italian was spoken . Magnani delivers the same type of energy that she displayed in " Rose Tattoo . " Quinn appears in the same gripping way as he did in his powerhouse performance in " La Strada " 3 years before . The woman who played Magnani's sister-in-law looked similar to Ida Kaminska . I wasn't surprised to see that she was also born in Poland . The earthy Magnani does not disappoint here . A must see film to see how this situation can be resolved and a marriage salvaged .
420987	2542703	461987	9.0	A Lover's Revenge - We Need More Revenge Like This	Terrific , well paced thriller with William R . Moses , the Ken Melansky on the old Perry Mason television series giving an absolutely riveting performance as a millionaire psychopath who abuses his wife to no end causing her to make telephone calls to a radio therapist . When he walks in on one of her calls , he chases her out of the house and she is fatally struck by a car while trying to flee .

420413	2542703	192647	9.0	Sun Never Sets for this Gang	Three distinctive Jewish stories highlight this 1991 film . One segment entitled " Yiddish " is an excellent venture into the world of senior citizens in Miami Beach , Florida . Harold Gould is one such senior . Intelligent and outgoing , he wants more out of life . Certainly more than what his long-time wife , played with gusto by Doris Roberts can offer . She is made for this part as the typical Miami Beach " yenta " parading around in loud-colored clothes with a big-mouth to match . One like her is content to sit by a set or gab with the neighbors all day . Gould begins to find relief from this way of life by attending a Yiddish workshop . There he meets a woman who shares the same problem that he does-boredom with his way of life . The two act beautifully at their Yiddish playhouse . As time goes on , they are drawn to each other . As time goes on , it's time to call in their respective spouses and children to discuss what is to be . Predictably , Roberts becomes hysterical at the thought that her husband is walking out on her . The other woman's husband seems to accept that his wife is leaving ; he has been preoccupied with his hobbies . The children on both sides are not happy , but in defiance to all , our new lovers walk out and ride on their bicycles away to begin a new life for themselves . This film tells us that it's never too late to enjoy life and to follow your dreams . Why continue to suffer a drab existence ? It's done well and is a pleasure to watch .
421151	2542703	358273	9.0	Walking A Great Line	Joaquin Phoenix gives a beautiful performance as the late Johnny Cash . Phoenix , who did his own singing , is absolutely superb as the late singer , who had a rough childhood with an abusive father whose disdain for him increased following the tragic death of his brother . Reese Witherspoon portrays June Carter , the love of Johnny's life . Ms . Witherspoon , though adequate in her acting , really has a supporting performance and why she has been nominated in the best actress category is an enigma to me . The picture belongs to Phoenix all the way . His characterization of fame , fortune , drugs and downward spiral are well done . The two sing quite well and the chemistry is great between them .
421611	2542703	37557	9.0	Money Can Be Everything-Brewster's Millions	Dennis O'Keefe in a field day romp in Brewster's Millions . He becomes an instant millionaire through inheritance but in order to get the full $8 million , he must spend $1 million by age 30 , which is in 2 months . He is not permitted to tell anyone why he is spending money as if there is no tomorrow . Naturally , his love-life will be adversely affected . Of course , when this occurs , O'Keefe gets that Midas Touch . Everything and everyone he touches yields a gold-mine . As his butler , Eddie ' Rochester ' Anderson has lots of fun here and you can see that he is enjoying himself . . The film co-stars Helen Walker as his befuddled girlfriend and there is a nice turn by June Havoc , as a flashy Broadway show-girl , caught up in this mayhem . The picture succeeds because of the fine performance of O'Keefe who has the part of the suddenly wealthy ex-G . I . down to a science . We feel his emotions of joy , frustration and comic desires .
421171	2542703	41373	9.0	Flamingo Road - Upper Society vs . Joan Crawford	A fabulous Joan Crawford vehicle reuniting her with Zachary Scott of " Mildred Pierce " fame . Again , Scott eventually takes a bullet , but this time it's by his own doing . The film came 4 years after " Pierce " and Crawford looks a lot older here , probably because of her lighter hair . The film is a good one involving upper vs . lower class and dirty , corrupt politics in the name of one Sydney Greenstreet , who is just wonderful here . ( I don't know what the other writers wanted with his performance . ) He is the embodiment of the big city corrupt official who will destroy anyone in his path . He thinks he is self-righteous yet and his name of Titus is most appropriate for him . As the carnival girl , trying to build a life for herself , Crawford etched another memorable performance . She is at her best when she lifts herself up from adversity . Scott is wonderful in the role of the guy , pushed up in politics and thrown into a political marriage with disaster resulting . David Brian has his moments as the other shady official who Crawford also falls for . Get yourself to Flamingo Road !
420806	2542703	37614	9.0	The Corn is Certainly Ripe " Corn is Green "	In comparison to past and her performances after 1945 , Bette Davis gave a restrained but compelling performance as the schoolteacher in a Welsh town who wants to improve the education of the town's children ( already mostly miners in " The How Green Was My Valley " vein ) through education . In this wonderful performance , I see elements of Davis's " The Little Foxes " as well as her 1944 film " Mr . Skeffington . " Leave it to Davis to find a brilliant student , a terrific John Dall , in her midst . The problem is that Dall is a drinker who feels he is betraying his fellow miners in pursuing an education . The maid's daughter , Bessie , played with evil intent by a fabulous Joan Loring , gets into trouble thanks to Dall , and she threatens to ruin all concerned . The end , where Davis agrees to take the unborn child and raise it herself , while vowing never to see Dall again , may be regarded today as corny but is well done . This film is memorable because of its depiction of class structure and the opportunity for upward mobility . Both Dall and Loring received Oscar nominations in the supporting categories but Davis was denied a best actress nomination here which is somewhat surprising . Mildred Dunnock and Rhys Williams costar as teachers in Ms . Moffat's school . Dunnock , so young here , but displays the same vulnerability as Elsie Thornton in 1957's " Peyton Place . "
420405	2542703	76666	9.0	Great Fever to Catch	John Travolta truly shines as dance hero Tony Monero in this wonderful 1977 production of " Saturday Night Fever . " When Friday night comes around , Tony can quickly forget about the rest of the week , get those dancing shoes ready , dress up and head down to that Bay Ridge Disco and dance the night away . The songs from the Bee Gee's are great . Shockingly , they were not nominated for best song among the Academy Award nominations . Why not ? What was the nominating committee thinking ? Tony has his problems at home and frustration at work . Dancing becomes an outlet for him and what an outlet he has . Fast on his feet , Arthur Murray praised Travolta's dancing in this film ; although , prudish Arthur and Katherine objected to the language . We see the lives of average Italian Brooklynites on the streets of Bay Ridge as well as the disco . Complications ensue . Tony's brother , a priest , comes home and announces that he is leaving the church . There may be homosexual implications but that is fortunately glossed over . Karen Lynn Gorney is an excellent dance partner for Tony . Usual TV good girl , Donna Pescow turns in a surprisingly good performance as a girlfriend rejected by Tony . There is plenty of excitement beyond the dance floor . That memorable scene on the bridge , where tragedy befalls a pal of Tony's , is terrifically done . Get out your dancing shoes and dance up a storm . This is sure one fever well worth catching .
420503	2542703	796368	9.0	Talk To Me , Please Do	Don Cheadle gave a remarkable performance as an ex-con who gets out of jail and enters the world of talk radio . His vulgarity seems to make it appear that he will get nowhere quite quickly but that all changes with the tragic assassination of Dr . Martin Luther King . Petey Greene ( Cheadle ) rises to the occasion and becomes an instant star . The film reminded me of the classic 1957 picture " A Face in the Crowd . " It shows how someone could attain instant fame and yet at the same time be unable to cope with the newly founded fame . Cheadle is absolutely off-the-wall in his chain smoking performance as the radio host Petey Greene . He certain overcomes any adversity but again is unable to live with his fame .
421280	2542703	117627	9.0	She Woke Up Pregnant-Biology Never Lies	Very interesting story which we can certainly relate to in our times . Connie , who is married with 2 children , finds herself pregnant . Tests indicate that her husband is not the father and naturally his suspicions are aroused . This is so since he had a vasectomy and the couple had briefly separated for 3 weeks . Suspicion soon falls on the dentist who had put her to sleep during a dental procedure . The dentists surprises all by admitting that he is the father but claiming that the 2 had an affair so the sex was consensual . Interestingly , Joe Penny plays the evil dentist and you really come to hate him . Joe has become like Richard Chamberlain and Perry King , the macho guy of television movies . Both parties bring charges against each other and it is very interesting to see how Penny is trapped at the end . The film depicts an almost end to a marriage , before the husband realizes that his wife is a victim . The film shows the intricacies of the court system and how you have to maneuver around it . Well acted and quite interesting . Makes you shutter when you have to go under for any procedure .
420698	2542703	45029	9.0	One Phone Call You'd Never Want to Receive	Surviving a plane crash and then going on to meet the families of those who did not . What an intriguing idea ! How morbid , to say the least ; but yet this is a well-done film mostly because of a fine ensemble cast . Shelley Winters is one of the passengers who did not make it . Following a difficult life and breakup , she is one of the passengers who interacted with the survivor . What do you say to the families at a time like this ? How does one feel ? Why did they survive the crash and the others did not ? We face serious questions of ethics and moral values in this film . Surprisingly , Bette Davis took a supporting role in this film . She is quite effective as the bedridden wife of one of the victims . No matter how large or small the part , Miss Davis always could figure it out !
420604	2542703	37913	9.0	Mildred the Great	Mildred Pierce , a comeback film for star Joan Crawford , brought her a well-deserved Oscar for best actress of 1945 . Crawford , as Pierce , portrays a woman whose marriage to her husband , nicely played by Bruce Bennett , falters . Left with 2 children , a vicious older daughter played in a superb memorable performance by Ann Blythe and a younger daughter , Pierce must fend for herself . Learning the restaurant business in a hurry as a waitress , Pierce soon goes into business for herself . Along the way , she meets up with Wallie , played well by Jack Carson , as an adviser , and Monte Berrigan , a shrewd , cunning , gigolo forever remembered by Zachary Scott . Monte knows how to show Veda a good time . Too good ; in fact . Veda fights with mom , tries to swindle her new husband by claiming she is pregnant , and slaps her mother when the latter finds out that she is not pregnant . Later , thinking that Veda will return if she marries Monte , Pierce does so , and in addition to the marriage , makes Monte a partner in the restaurant business . Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned . How about a mother who finds out that her daughter is carrying on with her step-father ? When confronted , Veda states that Monte will divorce her mother and marry her . When Mildred storms out , Berrigan calls Veda a tramp and proclaims that he'd never marry her . Shot dead for this statement , Veda pleads with her mother to save her stating that it's just as much her fault that the killing occurred . The film was shown in flash-back sequence where Mildred confesses to the killing but the cop is not buying the confession . An all-star cast including Eve Arden , as the fast-talking , wise-cracking Ida , are perfect . What a mother wouldn't do for a child is the theme of this movie . The film has all the emotions depicting a broken marriage , the death of the younger daughter , a fast-talking gigolo , an ungrateful , impossible daughter beyond control , and that money can't solve all the problems . .
420876	2542703	417217	9.0	You Bet . . . Gamble on " Two for the Money "	for viewing gambling as the root to all evil . Brandon knows how to pick sport winners so he is recruited by big-shot gambler Al Pacino to come to N . Y . and work for him . Brandon starts off as a Willie Stark , naive , smart and a regular guy . Pacino soon puts him through a metamorphosis of changing his name to John Anthony , and making him a general swinger-cigar smoking , with a drink in his hand kind of guy knowing full well how to use the f word . Pacino soon puts him on his cable station and John Anthony , with his football predictions and sly style , soon becomes a sensation . People will go along with his wagers and gamble heavily themselves . Naturally , we have the mob involved . When he does well , John is everyone's boy ; when the tables start to turn mobster " Armand Assante " shows how little he can regard human dignity and I'm putting that mildly . The picture though is a positive one . Showing that gambling is nothing more than suckers guessing who will win , it depicts when it's time to get out . This was one time you don't want to get out because of the usual outstanding performance of Al Pacino and Matthew McConaughey , the guy who Pacino makes as John Anthony . A searing look into the world of gambling . All bets are on for this rather good film .
421053	2542703	44903	9.0	Million Dollar Mermaid A Honey	Wonderful film exhibiting the talents of Esther Williams portraying swimming Annette Kellerman at the turn of the 20th century . The water sequences were never lovelier and the story of Kellerman , who overcame adversity as a young child , was remarkable . Victor Mature is in fine form as her promoter and eventual lover , Frank Sullivan . Jesse White brings his comic relief as Sullivan's side-kick and Walter Pidgeon is endearing as her father . Coming from Australia to star in the Hippidrome and other features , Kellerman exhibited outstanding talent in her swimming career while at the same time trying to maintain her dream of being a ballerina . Ballet star Maria Tallchief brief appears as the legendary Pavlova in the film . When professional differences end her romance with Sullivan , Kellerman really makes it on her own thanks to the help of David Brian , as the head of the Hippidrome . While the tragic accident she had while making " Neptune's Daughter " in Hollywood almost cost her her life , it brings on a wonderful moving ending . This is a highly entertaining film .
421481	2542703	55490	9.0	Susan Cuts No Slack in Susan Slade	By the early 1960s Hollywood was handling unwed pregnancies differently than they had done in the 1940s or even earlier . This film is no exception to that rule . Connie Stevens does a remarkable job in the film acting as churlish , and a totally obedient , young naive daughter to Lloyd Nolan and Dorothy McGuire in the film . Does she mature when she becomes pregnant and the child's father dies in a fall while mountain climbing . While Susan Hayward had nothing to fall back on other than marriage when she befell the same fate in " My Foolish Heart , " Stevens comes from an affluent family who flee to Guatemala where she gives birth and mom McGuire assumes the role of the baby's mother . Naturally , we have further sadness with the death of Nolan , from a heart condition that he kept from the family for years . There is ample support from friends Brian Aherne and Natalie Shafer , the latter always the wealthy high class matron , assumes a much more comforting and understanding role here . The real gem here other than Stevens is the performance by Troy Donahue , whose father embezzled from Aherne and hung himself in jail . Naturally , Donahue is to bear the stigma of being his father's son . Of course , love blossoms between him and Stevens . Aherne and Shafer have their young son , Burt Convy , as a love interest . The film is a good one due to story-line and the love of 2 people , both of whom society could have deemed as losers , if it weren't for the fate they shared together .
420510	2542703	389557	9.0	Zwartboek or Black Book Delivers	Terrific film dealing with the German occupation of Holland during World War 11 . The film is fabulous due to the exciting plot twists . Even though many of the good guys turn out to be villains , the film is done so well that you just don't mind having to think a little . Imagine , a Jewish woman , whose parents and brother were gunned down by Nazis , is eventually accused of being a traitor . An admirable job is done to depict her as this , especially since she was the one who helped to wire German headquarters while working for the Dutch underground . When it's discovered by the Nazis , what she is up to , they fabricate stories which they know will be heard by the underground . The cast of German and Dutch actors are wonderful . One question I have is since when was escaping to Belgium considered a panacea ?
420711	2542703	42546	9.0	The Wide Wonderful World of the Loony Bin - " Harvey " ' / 12	James Stewart shined in this comic performance of 1950 . Elwood P . Dowd is a mild-mannered gentleman whose difficulty is that he has an imaginary friend , Harvey , which is no less a rabbit ! Added to the confusion is his sister , the adorable but ever nutty Josephine Hull . Miss Hull apparently made a career of playing lunatics . She was excellent as Cary Grant's aunt in " Arsenic and Old Lace , " and for " Harvey , " she was voted best supporting actress . The fun really begins when Stewart is sent to a mental institution . Another example , of " One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest , " but in a comic vain . As always , in these situations , the tables are turned supposedly on normal sister Hull .
421044	2542703	824747	9.0	Changeling - Strong 1920s LAPD Corruption Setting	Lengthy but worthwhile Clint Eastwood film dealing with police corruption in Los Angeles in the late 1920s . Angelina Jolie gives a worthy performance as the mother of a kidnapped boy , victimized by the police when she refuses to accept the child they find and claim is hers as her own son . This shows and leads to a massive cover-up of the LAPD . When the police chief commits Mrs . Collins ( Jolie ) to an asylum for refusing to play ball with them , we see the corruption not only of the police department but the asylums of Los Angeles during this period . I thought that I was going back to Olivia De Havilland's " The Snake Pit " in 1948 . The film is well directed as usual by Clint Eastwood . Great how she shows the simultaneous trials of the man accused of killing the son of Mrs . Collins while the LAPD heads are tried for what they did to Mrs . Collins . Getting through that asylum was almost like " One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest . " The main problem with the film is that it is too long . It could have ended at least 20 minutes to one half hour before .
420996	2542703	62362	9.0	Millie oh Millie , You Are My Girl	Entertaining musical , made in 1967 , with Julie Andrews as Millie . She comes to town in the 1920s in the midst of a sort of sexual revolution for women . Andrews endears herself by singing Mazel Tov at a Jewish wedding . Her rendition of Jimmy Oh Jimmy , My Jimmy Boy will warm your heart . Along the way , she meets a very sheltered Mary Tyler Moore , who soon becomes a victim of a white slave trade run by innkeeper Beatrice Lillie , in an absolutely hilarious performance . Instead of Lillie getting a best supporting actress nomination , Carol Channing , as an eccentric wealthy widow , got the nod in that category . Years before he became U . S . Ambassador to Mexico in the Reagan administration , John Gavin , a handsome actor , played a love interest in the film . A wonderful journey of the flapper period .
421531	2542703	1269560	9.0	Love Takes Wing-Only Angels Have Them	This is a wonderful , endearing film which appears to be the beginning of a series on Hallmark network . While it resembles the former Dr . Quinn Medicine Woman television show of years back , we need more of this quality , heartwarming tales . Two female doctors venture forth to the west , this time Missouri . In a rural area , they encounter a cholera epidemic as well as the usual superstitions , prejudice and viciousness of a town in believing that the orphans caused the outbreak . 82 year old Cloris Leachman is just wonderful as a dedicated woman working in the orphanage . There is also fine acting by Patrick Duffy as the conflicted mayor of the town and by director Lou Diamond Philips , who also plays a heavy in the film . One doctor soon finds a male interest and by the end of the show , they wed . Of course , just like Dr . Quinn , they adopt Lillian , a precocious youngster caught up in the epidemic , who acts like a young Florence Nightingale . Looking forward to the continuation of this Love series .
420733	2542703	35982	9.0	Hello Frisco , Hello - S . F . Great As Always	Wonderful music and sumptuous color mark this great 1943 film . The song You'll Never Know won the academy award that year and deservedly so . This is a sparkling musical where John Payne really shines as Johnny Cornell , a street hustler , who goes from rags to riches . While I thought that Clark Gable would have been fabulous in the part , Payne is quite good here . Alice Faye seemed to just get better and better . Continuing her tradition in " Alexander's Rag Time Band , " she goes through a lot to get her man . Jack Haley and June Havoc give great musical support to Payne and Fay . Havoc looks just like Lucille Ball in several scenes . Hard to believe that just 4 years later , she portrayed Jewish secretary Elaine Wales in " Gentleman's Agreement . " I guess that's what acting is all about . The devil here is Lynn Bari , a socialite from Knob Hill who is wiped out only to marry an up and coming Cornell and then take him for a financial ride . Of course , love conquers all at the end but you will feel so good after seeing this film . They just don't make musicals like this anymore .
420751	2542703	758720	9.0	Shell Seekers - Seek Out this Wonderful Film	I have to admit that as much as I dislike Vanessa Redgrave for her political views , she gave a wonderful performance in this film . The story of a painter , whose paintings are worth a fortune and are desired by two greedy children , is an absolute artistic treasure . Flashbacks are beautifully realized to show the unhappy life of the Redgrave character during World War 11 . It depicts a war-bride marriage and a tragic love affair . When the boyfriend of Redgrave's youngest daughter's b is killed in a boating accident , his daughter goes to live with Redgrave and the two develop an important bond . The ending will forever tug at your heart and you will know that Redgrave did right in her will . Max Schell appears briefly as young Redgrave's artist . He is great here and shows a completely American accent .
420398	2542703	48947	9.0	Anastasia-You Are the One	After her scandal with Director Rosselini , would the American public accept Ingrid Bergman again ? The answer was a resounding yes in 1956 when Bergman won her 2nd best actress Oscar for Anastasia , the story of a girl who might be the only surviving member of the Czar Nicholas's murdered family . Yul Brynner had a banner year in 1956 . Besides playing the man who introduces Bergman as Anastasia to society , he gave a brilliant performance in The Ten Commandments and won the best acting Oscar for The King and I . Terrific by any standards . Remember the beautiful song written at the time of the movie ? Remember those lyrics ? Anastasia , are you the one ? Why wasn't Helen Hayes nominated for supporting actress in this film ? As the grandmother of Anastasia , she gave a heart-wrenching soul searching performance . Bergman's innocence or lack of was just perfect for the part . At the end , Hayes tells all to go home as the show is over . As Anastasia has fled , is she an impostor ? Was she the real descendant of the Romanovs who panicked ? We may never know that but what we do know is that we had a wonderful picture .
421439	2542703	50681	10.0	Who Was Asleep in Oscarville ? Cagnes Shines in Another Biopic	What were the members of the Motion Picture Academy thinking when James Cagney was not nominated for his outstanding performance as Lon Chaney in 1957's " Man of A Thousand Faces . " ? Cagney was at his best portraying the masquerade man whose personal life was such a heartbreak . This was certainly an outstanding follow-up after the wonderful " Love Me or Leave Me " two years before . Fresh from her Oscar win for " Written on the Wind , " Dorothy Malone pulled off another great performance . Cagney's acting toward his deaf mute parents was a sight to behold . Celia Lovsky , a veteran Hollywood matron , was his loving mother . Her bold eyes spoke of the love that she could not blurt out due to deafness . Always a sympathetic woman , Lovsky was the real life live in girlfriend of actor Peter Lorre . Who can forget Cagney during his terminal cancer scenes ? Unbelievable .
421492	2542703	62994	10.0	Funny Girl , Wonderful Girl ( 1968 )	Barbra Streisand detailing the heart-breaking life of Fannie Brice in " Funny Girl . " Starting out life on the lower east side , Brice achieved stardom being going to the Ziegfeld Follies . She soon proves herself to be a formidable match to Florenz Ziegfeld himself , played by the wonderful Walter Pigeon . She matches wits with him and in the end does a part the way she wants it done . Hilarious and outrageous at best . Of course , the film deals with the romance and her marriage to gambler Nickie Arnstein , a remarkable Omar Sharif . Kay Medford plays her mother and in a very funny scene , Arnstein plays poker with the girls including the late Mae Questel . Out of kindness , he lets the ladies win . Naturally , there is plenty of heartbreak in this great musical film . Shady dealings leads Arnstein to prison . When he comes out , he decides to end the marriage as he felt that the two were just not good for each other . This leads Streisand to belt out on stage the classic My Man . There's not a dry eye in the house after her beautiful rendition . Streisand wonderfully captures Brice's antics as Baby Snooks and other routine sketches . Her Jewish accent is way up to par and for all this she tied with Katharine Hepburn for " The Lion in Winter , " for best actress . Streisand sings like a beautiful bell in this rich William Wyler production .

Randall hopes that Hudson will do great scoring when he loans him his weekend retreat in Connecticut . This was the only film that Doris Day was ever Oscar nominated for . Thelma Ritter received her 5th of 6 supporting nominations for this film . A classy movie , funny to watch , and a pleasure to view . You may even wish for cross-wires after seeing this great film .
420608	2542703	33729	10.0	Poignant Valley A Masterpiece	A Welch coal mining town ; impoverished as ever , but rich in family relations , is the theme for How Green Was My Valley , an outstanding picture . Those coal miners , suffering from black lung disease , are forever remembered with poverty etched on their faces . They work long days and have little for it . They work for an uncaring management . They go on strike with violence resulting . The cast is top-rate . Donald Crisp , as the patriarch , won a supporting Oscar for his performance . He is strict but understanding . His wife , astutely played by Irish theater actress , Sara Allgood , is superb . Her scenes with the striking workers , and with family are all memorably done . Allgood was nominated for best supporting actress and unfortunately lost to Mary Astor for " The Great Lie . " This was a travesty . Maureen O'Hara , as Anharyd , their loving daughter , who loves the town preacher , but yet never marries him . Instead , she marries into the family of the owner of the coal mine . The marriage is loveless and subject to criticism by the town gossips , who direct their attention to the kind wholesome preacher , admirably played by Walter Pigeon . " 37 years in the family , " Anharyd is constantly reminded of this head housekeeper , wonderfully realized by Ethel Griffies . Note her social snobbishness as she too looks down on the less fortunate . Speaking of social class distinction , the scenes where scholar Huw ( Roddy McDowall ) attend school are fantastically realized when he encounters children as well as a hostile teacher , all of whom despise Huw Morgan for being a member of coal miners . We're in an era of the picture where belonging to a union or just mentioning a union smacked of socialism . The whistle signifying an accident in the coal mine is forever haunting . How much can the Morgan family take ? The film is a tribute to coal miners and others working in hazardous industries . The warmth of family surrounded by poverty is another theme dealt well in this film . You will just burst out crying when Allgood , at the mine when her husband is killed , speaks out that her dead son , along with her husband , came to her . " My father never died , " says Huw . Such is also true of this magnificent film . It must be remembered that How Green Was My Valley was voted best picture of 1941 by the Motion Picture Academy . It beat out Citizen Kane , regarded by many as the best film ever made . To me , the academy made the right choice , politics aside . We all know family values and we can value this true American classic .
421182	2542703	79219	10.0	Going in Style Really is	A terrific gem of a film . Three elderly men are so bored with their lives that they rob a bank and actually get away with it for a while .

Coming back to face the ultimate music , 2 of our " heroes " pass on and leave the rest of the story and the loot to the survivor . A sad but extremely effective commentary on retirement and old age . If you're contemplating retirement , miss this film until you know how you're going to spend your days .
421624	2542703	375986	10.0	Mother Teresa is A Spiritual Mother for All Seasons	Marvelous film showcasing the excellent acting talent of Olivia Hussey . Hard to believe that it's over 35 years since her 1968 interpretation of " Romeo and Juliet . " This is an extremely inspiring story of the nun who looked for the most simplicity of life in aiding the impoverished . Her dedication to the suffering of mankind is definitely an inspiration to us all . Not only does the picture beautifully capture what she must endure working among the impoverished , it also shows the problems that she goes through within the Catholic church , accusations of corruption and trying to accomplish her goals in a society that is not accustomed to handle what she wants done . Hussey is simply magnificent in the part of this saintly woman . She has her down to every movement of her walking , talking , etc . Too bad that the film did not bring out that Mother Teresa came from an affluent Albanian family . A wonderful film of the human spirit .
420811	2542703	34092	10.0	Remember the Day - Dewey A Winner Here	A marvelous film in the genre of Miss Dove , Mr . Chips and every wonderful teacher you ever had . The role was just perfect for Claudette Colbert . She really worked magic with co-star John Payne . This picture really offers Americana circa 1916 in Indiana . The embodiment of the school structure at that time is so well done . The obedient student , the prim and proper schoolteachers who dedicated their lives to teaching and nothing else . Nora Trinell ( Colbert ) is a dedicated , wonderful teacher but she goes against what society thought of as a role for teachers when she finds love with Payne . The " crisis " that leads to his dismissal and his ultimate redemption on the part of the principal is beautifully done here . For me , the picture was so good because Trinell reminded me of my grade 5 teacher who inspired me in the field of social sciences . Colbert , as the teacher who found love and tragically lost it , has one of her best film roles here . A caring person to her students , especially Dewey , she certainly tells the truth when she says that each year a teacher finds a student who she can really love as her own . Those words will forever stay with me . As the typical spinster teacher , Anne Revere , was wonderful . Prone to be a gossip , she embodied what society thought was the role of a teacher in this period . The ending will tug at your heart . Nostalgic and so wonderfully realized .
421290	2542703	53291	10.0	and More for Classic Comedy Film	Billy Wilder was really at the top of his game with this screwball comedy hit of 1959 . When loser-musicians Joe and Jerry ( Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon ) witness the Saint Valentine's Day Massacre in Chicago , they look to leave town at once . While in freezing Chicago , they seek out an opportunity to join an all girls ' band that's headed towards Florida . Our 2 heroes soon adopt the names of Josephine and Daphne and that's when the hilarity really begins . The film has a top-notch cast including Marilyn Monroe in the part that was made for her-Sugar Kowalski - a love stricken loser who loves to hit the booze to drown out her problems . Joyce Jameson , a frequent artist under Wilder , is in rare form as Sweet Sue , the head of the band . Joey E . Brown as the millionaire who falls for Daphne is just divine and George Raft , as Spats , the guy who is the head of the gang and after Josephine and Daphne , is in perfect form . Pat O'Brien is simply memorable as the chief of police . After a wonderful existence in hiding out in Florida , the 2 come face to face with the gang when the latter shows up there for a salute to the Friends of the Italian Opera . The writing is near perfect along with the performances . Curtis ' imitation of Cary Grant is memorable . " Some Like It Hot " should have been nominated for best picture in 1959 . It would have lost anyway to " Ben-Hur " but this film is truly a tribute to comedy . Anway , wasn't this better than the nominated " Anatomy of A Murder ? "
420874	2542703	49509	10.0	It Rained Full of Tears	Van Johnson and Jane Wyman starred in this 1956 film , " Miracle in the Rain . " Wyman stars as a typical plain Jane . She has a job and a wonderful friend , played with sympathy and understanding by the usually capable Eileen Heckart . In a chance meeting , Wyman meets soldier Van Johnson . The two are a match made in heaven . Fate shall determine an early entrance into the latter for them both . Wyman came from a dysfunctional home . Her father abandoned her mother when she was quite young . Look for Alan King and Barbara Nichols in a brief but memorable scenes as a couple who befriend Jane and Van . When Wyman receives word that Johnson has been killed in action , it is Heckart who uttered , " He was my friend , too . " Wyman never recovers from the shock of Johnson's death and with a bad cold , runs out in pouring rain to go to church for salvation . It is there that she collapses with a locket in her hand that had been Johnson's . Heckart finds Wyman collapsed in the street . She dies in her arms with Johnson's locket in her hands . As Wyman collapses , a further miracle occurs . After years away from the family , the father returns to the mother ( Josephine Hutchinson ) in a poignant scene . Miss Wyman was well typecast in tear-jerkers such as " The Blue Veil , " ( 1951 ) , " Magnificent Obsession , " ( 1954 ) , and " All that Heaven Allows , " ( 1956 ) . She certainly knew how to pour out those tears . " Miracle in the Rain " is an extremely sad movie . Nonetheless , it will evoke sympathy from you . Just make sure you have a box of tissues with you . Simply memorable .
421575	2542703	84805	10.0	Tootsie Rolls !	Uproarious film with Dustin Hoffman , desperate for a job , who lands a part of a female in a soap opera that his girl-friend , Sandy , Teri Garr , was supposed to audition for . The laughs come a mile a minute . With the excellent director Sydney Pollack , who goes in front of the camera as Hoffman's agent , and a phenomenal cast , this film can't miss and it doesn't . Hoffman is positively brilliant in the role of Michael Dorsey who becomes Dorothy Michaels . All I can say is that Tony Curtis , ( " Some Like it Hot " - move over . ) Problem is that the role of Dorothy begins to interfere with Michael's personal life . Co-star in the soap opera , Jessica Lange , in a supporting Oscar performance , believes he is a lesbian . Dorothy meets her widowed father , the wonderful Charles Durning , a redneck , who begins to have designs on Dorothy for himself . Teri Garr is Michael's girl friend who doesn't know that Michael has gone drag and further believes that he is carrying on with Julie ( Lange ) Of course , there is Dabney Coleman as the director of the soap opera who mistreats Julie as well . It appears that Dorothy is able to solve the problems of others whether it be on the show or off camera . How she finally shows herself to be Michael is brilliant film-making . Tootsie received a well-deserved Oscar nomination for best picture . It lost to " Gandhi . " Hoffman was nominated for best actor . Did anyone think of nominating him for best actress ? Teri Garr was also nominated in the supporting actress division .
421037	2542703	86765	10.0	Where Jessica Visits , Murder Always Follows	Outstanding television series where retired English teacher , Jessica Fletcher , a mystery writer tries successfully to solve a murder each week . No matter where Angela Lansbury goes , there is always a murder . She is almost like Columbo in her pursuit for the culprit . The show was a field day for Angela Lansbury to further showcase her brilliant acting talent . Of course , as far as I'm concerned , there will never be another Angela as Mrs . Iselin in 1962's " The Manchurian Candidate . " Angela , as Mrs . Iselin , portrayed a monster of a woman , one of the worst female characters ever depicted on screen . The show " Murder , She Wrote " was further enhanced by having veteran performers as guest stars on the show . Regulars , such as William Windom , certainly added spice . You knew it was Sunday night when that familiar opening theme began the show . The theme sounded like an ice cream trucking coming along the block . As is the case with ice cream , the show was equally delicious .
