504613	2911571	95734	1.0	Ptooey	Dan Haggerty has sure been in some fine movies . Elves , and this . . . and maybe some other equally fine movies . Grizzly Adams stuff , I reckon . I guess you could call this Nightmare on Elm Street meets Platoon , but that's an insult to Nightmare On Elm Street and I've never seen Platoon , but that's the first war movie that came to mind . Some Vietnam vets are having realistic dreams about their experiences during the war . They actually look rather young to have been there at all considering the war ended a good 16-17 years before this movie was made ? I found this to be a very flat movie , little in the way of excitement or scares . It does have the " Nightmare on Elm St . " thing going on though with trying to stay awake or having someone watch you so they can wake you up if the dream gets too bad . I could identify with the trying to stay awake part , I was having a lot of trouble with that myself . One absolutely ridiculous scene consists of two guys lying on a double bed in a suburban bedroom , dressed in their combat fatigues , firing their machine guns while asleep . What the hell ? Anyway , I passed this one up time after time at the " used " store , but finally broke down and got it because I was intrigued . Nothing to be intrigued about , guess I should go with my gut feelings . Ptooey .
504159	2911571	161634	1.0	gratuitous torture and violence with NO redeeming values	I've seen other Guinea Pig films , like Mermaid in a Manhole & He Never Dies , and while they're pretty sick , they at least have a bit of a sense of humor to them ( however dark ) . Devil's Experiment though , is nothing more than filming a bunch of punks submitting a young girl to many methods of torture and violence and there's no plot and no redeeming values to it whatsoever . It isn't remotely scary , except for perhaps the mind-set , but it's definitely disgusting and I certainly would not call it entertainment . Now , I'm not the paragon of good taste in films and I like my trash and sleaze , but this was too much for me , really . I'm all for disturbing , in fact , I seek out things that are disturbing whenever possible , but this was a bit much . The young woman is kicked , beaten , submitted to continuous noise via headphones until she drools , and then pelted with raw meat and innards and left hanging in a hammock out in the woods somewhere . If you think that sounds great , go for it , but it certainly put me off viewing any more Guinea Pig stuff . , absolutely nauseating .
504719	2911571	183072	2.0	yikes . . . .	There are some movies that are so horrific , so riveting , and so shocking , that there is almost a hypnotic effect on the viewer and they sit , transfixed , mouth hanging open , waiting to see what happens next . This is not one of those movies , but it does have a hypnotic effect , of sorts . More of a numbing effect , I think . Thankfully I was able to break through that effect and get up and stop this and put it somewhere where it could do no more harm . Imagine fans of Ed Wood and Don Dohler making a movie with carnivorous alien sock puppets and you about have it . Wooden acting at its finest , and when the sock puppet aliens feed , they flop down on top of something in the manner that Cathy ( from the comic strip " Cathy " ) throws herself on top of food to eat . . . the artist can't draw someone eating properly , and the special effects person here couldn't create aliens to look like they were feeding properly either so they are shown flopped on top of someone and afterward there is somewhat of a messy spot . Interesting because there are no visible mouths . We have two hapless boobs wandering the country in search of the Atlantic Ocean , but they had to stop at THIS place right when an alien invasion was taking place , one laments . Interesting that they're from out of state but have the same license plates as everyone else . And if I'm looking at license plates then you know how interesting and exciting this movie is . There is also a second film on this DVD called " Feeders Two : Slay Ride " and I'm wondering if I have the nerve to try to watch it . I'm thinking if it was done later than perhaps the actors and special effects folks had perfected their craft a bit and it'll be much better . I'm also thinking that life is too short to watch REALLY bad movies and that it should go into the trade-in pile unwatched . For those with a high threshold for pain . .
504583	2911571	382077	2.0	a desperate move ?	Is the " R " rating on this movie a desperate move to make folks think that it's more " meaty " than all the " PG-13 " ' horror ' movies that are coming out lately ? Well , needless to say I felt that held a bit of hope for this . Of course the previews have all the best parts and don't subject one to the reality of how truly dull this movie is . Nobody would go see it , then , duh ? My buddy & I went to see this yesterday afternoon and we were both very disappointed . There is a lot of " build up " in this movie and what is it building up to ? Who or what is Charlie ? Well , you find out who / what Charlie is , but afterward the movie just goes on and on . Robert DeNiro is totally wasted in this , he's done so many creepy movies over the years but this definitely isn't one of them . The basic storyline is a man & his daughter move upstate NY from NYC after the mother kills herself , and the daughter finds a new friend named Charlie , who seemingly lives in a cave in the woods . Strange things begin to happen around the house , and when they do it's always the fault of Charlie . This could have been a decent supernatural sort of chiller maybe , but instead the makers chose to go a different route , and they didn't pick the road less traveled . A huge disappointment , stars .
505238	2911571	447448	2.0	More formulaic garbage	There's a lot of bad horror movies coming from Texas these days , and this is but one , the tale of a slaughterhouse worker that was killed and then comes back to life 10 years later to exact his revenge , or something along those lines . We have your usual under-brained and over-sexed teenagers , busily killing off whatever brain cells they have left with beer & pot , deciding to go see this place , and this guy called Stoner who is set up to dress up like the killer and scare the girls on tape . Whee . Throughout the course of the film young Stoner consumes enough wacky tobaccy to immobilize a small country but is still conscious , or what passes for conscious if you're in a movie like this . He doesn't get out of his car , and when the kids think he's in there all dressed up , nope , it's the real thing . There's one almost decent special effect in which the guy that has the sickle says " I gotta split " and does , but I've already seen THAT effect in Ichi the Killer , which is done much better and is a movie more worthy of your time than this video cow-patty . Not a scare to be found , not an original idea or decent script either , but our buds at Lion's Gate see fit to put it out at their usual outrageous price ? Yeah , whatever , and I'm being generous here , duuude .
505205	2911571	110065	2.0	What a mess	Hey now , a young studly ex-doctor ( who gave up his practice for booze and women , apparently ) is called to a religious cult compound to take care of an ex-girlfriend of his . This cult is run by a brother and sister out of a huge house / compound that has high security and doesn't let anyone out . All the worker bees in the cult must abide by strict rules but the brother and sister get drunk all the time on wine and are treated like royalty by the workers . This is a fairly low-budget movie with a pretty sketchy plot that degenerates into something far less interesting than a creepy religious cult as it winds its way toward the end . Not a lot of interesting things going on here except the recurring themes of getting drunk , and ( for the doctor and for one young worker , trying to get AWAY ) . And , AWAY you should stay , for this is not for you , nor for anyone else . An absolute waste of good film and your time . Ptoeey .
505679	2911571	848552	2.0	A complete waste of time	A comedy about people turned into zombies ( or something ) by eating tainted beef ? Oh boy . Billy Zane plays a " stuck in the 80's " doctor who travels to a small town with his girlfriend , daughter , & daughter's boyfriend , only to find that the town's residents are being turned into killing machines by eating tainted beef ( free range , organic tainted beef , though ) from a local farm . Seems that there was a problem with the cows on this farm getting sick , but the farmer " found something on the internet " to make the well again . Well , that's not exactly what happened , but it doesn't keep the old geezer from grinding the cows up and selling them to the local diner . After which folks dine on the tainted meat and go wacko . This whole thing is just a waste , and it's not funny , except for one scene in which Zane tries to keep zombies out of a hotel room & finally puts the " do not disturb " sign on the door knob before slamming the door shut again . Lots of spew and lots of blood but nothing you haven't probably seen a million times before . If you're undemanding in your entertainment then go ahead , watch it , but I found it to be a total waste of time . .
505017	2911571	129358	2.0	Was this meant to be taken seriously ? If not , it's still hilarious . . . .	Hard to say if this was meant to be taken seriously , but a college professor is commissioned ( by none other than exploitation king David Friedman ) to go find a Bigfoot-like creature in the Okaloosa wilds in Alabama . Along for the trip is an overly helpful former student , and a bunch of over-fed rednecks with guns , to take pictures only though , of course . It seems as though the character played by Friedman lost his son to this beast , and he wants revenge . And the professor is apparently none too bright , because he seems to suspect nothing . The beast is a rather tragic figure , really , since it's some poor schmuck in a gorilla suit with some kind of rigid ugly mask . It , of course , manages to elude capture and bullets and just about everything else , and the professor , while talking to himself the whole time , manages to kill everyone but the girl and they ride off into the sunset , sort of . You see the beast from afar , several times , but no matter how far away it is , it always is treated like it's right on the intrepid explorer's tails , and they're always moseying for their lives . Throw in some guitar & mandolin picking , and a bunch of talking , and that's about it , really . Oh , and there's some other fine upstanding campers in the area , and the girl , after a fine show of cellulite , dresses up in a red frilly skirt and shorty top , yecch . . . . and I think she's also got on patent leather shoes and white knee-socks . Absolutely stunning . Anyway , this gets her white trash boyfriend all hot , & while he's having his way along comes our monster & cuts in . Definitely the highlight of the film . Plenty of unintended laughter , really . . . . and I'm in awe that someone could crank something out like this and be serious about it , really . Definitely a " regional " film , probably best enjoyed by " regional " folks . .
505076	2911571	353351	2.0	Dud : The Movie	I supposed I was actually expecting a Bollywood remake of " The Fog " , from the title , but this is actually more of a Bollywood remake of " I Know What You Did Last Summer " , with some elements of " Scream " , kind of , sort of , and not a very good one either . Apart from a couple very entertaining song & dance numbers , this is pretty terrible . It's obviously got a decent budget & yet it's wasted on reheated leftovers that weren't that tasty to begin with . A young woman is threatened by a creepy guy to not enter a beauty contest , because he wants his sister to win ( she , thankfully , doesn't look as creepy as her brother ) , but she enters anyway and wins , and of course the creepy guy comes after her , and is killed , after which comes a rousing game of " hide the body " . Of course , the body disappears and no one seems to know why , but someone knows , and they're waiting for the end to reveal a ridiculous plot twist . Interspersed with all this tired rehash are a few nifty dance numbers , especially the celebratory dance number at the party for Simran , the girl who won the beauty contest . . . it's highly colorful , it's well done & downright fun , and utterly wasted in this terrible film . I would much rather watch an old Ramsay brothers movie than this piece of crap , although someone has deemed that these don't need to be made available , for the most part , which is a crime in itself . But not as big of a crime as this film . I took one for the team watching this one , so take my advice , don't bother . .
504376	2911571	54333	2.0	Horrifying	Hmm , back in 1962 , " hideous " and " blood curdling " must have meant a bit more than they do now , I guess , because the only hideous thing I found in this movie was the dubbing . A bunch of dancers on a plane , on their way to Singapore , crash land on an island that's full of big spiders ( not GIANT spiders , though , that's some other movie ) and when they bite the women's manager , he turns into a human spider monster , or something . . . . and lurks in the bushes , touching their hair and stealing their scarves with his long claws . In the words of Joe Flaherty on SCTV , oooh , scary stuff , kids . Along come two young guys that are assistants to the already - dead - when - they - found - him professor , and they help the women to get away from the island , woo hoo . For some reason the men in this seem to be holding their guts in the whole time they have their shirts off , and while what the women were doing may have been kind of racy for 1962 but now it's pretty tame & laughable . A movie that doesn't succeed as either horror or " adult " entertainment . Truly a bore .
503900	2911571	70893	3.0	chock full of jaw-dropping unintentional entertainment value	A sarcophagus containing the remains of a Hatian voodoo priest is taken aboard a cruise ship and guess what ? That's a bad thing . For the voodoo priest isn't dead , and he wreaks havoc . Most of the reason for wreaking havoc seems to be that his long-lost lover , Kenya , seems to be on board , but Kenya is played by a different actress than the woman that this man now has his sights set on , Sylvia . Not to mention that one seems to be black and one seems to be white . I say " seems " because it also seems that it's hard to tell what race people are supposed to be in this because they keep changing . ? ? Now , Sylvia is the secretary and love object of Dr . Kessling , who is the man who is responsible for transporting the sarcophagus to a museum , and he also seems to have discovered the secret of its occupant , who manages to change places with an incoming professor and take his place , that is , after that particular poor soul is run over by a steam roller , egad . I really don't know how to better describe this but it's like " Love Boat goes horror " flick in the hands of some of the most incompetent film makers you could imagine . Incredibly cheesy special effects , like a severed head that looks either plastic or plaster . One cool thing though is the ring , worn by the priest , it's like a snake with a hypo on the end that dispenses curare , the better to make zombies with . This is incredibly cheap and incoherent , but worth seeing once for a few laughs and to realize that it's obscure for a good reason . .
505069	2911571	71256	4.0	not the standout in " The Blind Dead " collection	The first two " Blind Dead " films are pretty good , and the first is a classic of sorts . Not so for this one . A woman , who is a model , goes in search of her roommate , who is also a model , but seems to have disappeared . She's part of a super-secret advertising campaign for designer sporty life-boats or something ( yes really ) , and she and another model have stranded themselves somewhere in the North Sea near the shipping lanes so that they can supposedly be rescued in style . The two women are supposedly stuck in one area , and surrounded by fog & tropic heat , and then they spot an old galleon , but stupidly expect to be rescued & have absolutely no qualms in hopping aboard this derelict ship . And guess who is on board ? Why , it's our old friends , the walking dead Templar Knights . And you know that no good can come of that . To the rescue , though , is Lillian ( Maria Perschy ) , the head of the sporting goods conglomerate , the woman looking for her roommate ( Noemi ) , and some professor of something . . . . who wants to see this ship , although supposedly it doesn't exist . He's a professor that apparently has a B . S . , because that's certainly what he spouts . There's all kinds of stuff like talk of " other dimensions " , etc . , but why are rats running around a ship in another dimension with nothing but dead Templars on board ? Got me . The dialog is totally ridiculous , to the point of being hilarious , especially when the professor is holding forth on his theories . And when the Templars make themselves known and are driven back " to the hell from where they came " ( which in this case is apparently the hold of the ship ) , there's some kind of notebook or something sitting on the hatch that slides down inside before the hatch finally closes . . . . was that the script ? Could have been , oh well , I don't think anyone was using it anyway . A hoot for bad movie fans , but a real come-down after the first couple " Blind Dead " movies , which are actually worth seeing . .
505383	2911571	71415	4.0	more a Medieval drama than a horror film	Despite the ( English ) title , this seems to have little to do with Devils and much more to do with a power hungry ruler who seeks the Philospher's Stone & wants gold made from lead ( & virgin's blood ) . Jacinto Molina plays Gilles de Lancre and seems to have little issue with having people put to death when he thinks they threaten his position or when he needs virgins for their blood . He's basically egged on by his lady love and an alchemist that he's employed and it's more greed and insanity that seems to be his problem than demonic possession ( unfortunately ) . There are parts that are at least somewhat exciting like jousting and grown men trying to knock each other down with big sticks , and the film at least has a good look to it , but otherwise there's little about this to recommend . Little in the way of gore and nothing to be afraid of at all , and most unusual , for a Molina / Naschy film , not really any unintentional humor . Therefore , .
504842	2911571	55946	4.0	eek !	This movie was a vehicle made by Arch Hall , Sr . to launch his son into " teen idol status " . That being , Arch Hall , Jr . , who to me resembles sort of a cross between Mickey Rooney & Billy Idol . My God , that hair . . . Anyway Eegah is some kind of ancient caveman that's somehow miraculously survived in a desert area ( Palm Springs , apparently , otherwise no gas pump jockey would be driving a Corvette ) . Roxy , who is Tom's girlfriend ( Hall , Jr . ) is going to the club for dinner & Tom is to join her later , but she finds Eegah ( as played by Richard Kiel ) on the road and is almost apparently clubbed and dragged off by her hair if Tom hadn't happened along and scared him off . Anyway , later , Hall Sr . ( who plays Roxy's dad ) decides to don a pith helmet and jaunty safari outfit to go out into the desert and search for this giant Roxy says she saw . So he does and he finds him and then disappears . So of course Tom & Roxy go looking for him in Tom's dune buggy , which is actually one of the most fun and enjoyable parts of the movie , with cool background music to boot . Of course they find that dear old dad is being held in a cave by Eegah , and soon they're his prisoners too . While in the cave , Roxy gets to see Eegah's etchings . . . one of which she exclaims over . . . " look , it's me in my car ! " . Uh , sorry , it looks like a flying pig . Anyway , the trio manages to escape the cave and you think that's the end of the film ( or you hope ) but NO , there's more , as Eegah manages to get from the middle of the desert to this town in a matter of seconds in search of Roxy . And if you thought things couldn't go much more downhill than they were already , you'd unfortunately find yourself wrong . I didn't mention that Tom played guitar either , and whenever he does there's all kinds of percussion and back-up vocals that come out of nowhere to accompany him , wow , now THAT'S talent . Unfortunately he can't sing his way out of a wet paper bag , although I think he does in every movie except " The Sadist " , which is probably one of his best because dear old dad didn't get involved . I dunno , I've heard a lot about this movie over time and had never seen it , and now that I have , finally , I can't say it's the absolute worst I've ever seen , and it does have some camp value , but it goes on WAY too long after it should have ended . Now that I've had my curiosity satisfied I can move on to bigger and better ( I can only hope ) things . .
505081	2911571	384537	4.0	what on earth did I just see ?	I saw Silent Hill yesterday & had been very much looking forward to it since seeing the previews a few months ago , despite the fact that someone told me it was based on a video game . I still had great hopes for the movie though , but some time into it when I was waiting for something to happen that " wowed " me , and it never did , I got the sinking feeling that I was watching yet another bomb . The elements for a great movie are all there , and I love the idea of a ghost town where fires from a coal mining disaster still burn underground , and there's some great effects and some great looking scenes but there's a great big something MISSING that I can't quite put my finger on , maybe a coherent story ? I'm not a video game kind of guy so I don't know anything about the game itself , so I don't know if you had to be familiar with the game to understand the movie ? If that's the case then maybe it should have been released just to video or something . I did really like the atmosphere of this and some of the effects are VERY creepy but those were just thrown in here and there for " shock value " , I guess , and provided no insight as to what the hell was going on . From what I could figure , a mom takes her daughter to the town of Silent Hill because the daughter is " disturbed " and always mentions the town's name in her dreams , so mom figures this is the easiest way to confront her fears or something . Makes sense , right ? Only in the movies , I guess . The town is of course a ghost town from coal fires burning below ground for over 30 years and it's off limits but that doesn't stop mom . She's followed by a rather suspicious ( for no good reason ) WV state motorcycle cop too , and they both end up wandering the town looking for the now-missing daughter and find all manner of weirdos and whatever other things are there , evil mutants or something ? Of course dad is not happy about mom's decision to do this either & follows along , encounters more suspicious cops , etc . For a small ghost town there sure a lot of folks wandering around but I guess they're all dead or in some kind of limbo or something , and they all take refuge at the church and yell things about burning witches and stuff . I rather felt in limbo myself . I kept waiting , waiting , for something to happen that actually caused an emotion or fear and yet the film managed to end without that ever happening . I guess maybe this is an acquired taste , or maybe it just sucked . .
505460	2911571	1237863	4.0	no worse than 80's " direct to video " stuff , really . . but that's no recommendation	If you liked things like " Video Violence " , " Woodchipper Massacre " , " Cannibal Campout " , etc . , then you may well like this , because it could have been made around the same time . It has the same look , the same feel , and the same ( ahem ) quality . Amy is a girl who has just returned from a funeral in Japan . Her boyfriend Nick has cooked up an idea for them to go to some " adult " resort , for a little wild weekend , but Amy is apparently a virgin and intending to remain that way , which of course , makes things a bit difficult . Upon arriving at this " resort " , they are greeted by the loony caretaker , Walter , who is kind enough to reveal the size of his penis to them , after which they go into their cabin and lock the door . Nick has ideas that Amy isn't warming up to so of course , things are getting uncomfortable . But , this isn't just ANY resort , it's one that has a mysterious killer lurking about and busily slaughtering young ladies . He's armed with all the requisite maniac tools , like a chain saw , etc . There's lots of fake blood squirted everywhere , like , by a hose or something , there's a bit of strangeness in one cabin where the guests are playing some kind of " father knows best " type scenario , with mom being a guy , there's two weirdo desk clerks from the resort office that mess with an Ouija board but those two DO have great taste in movie posters . And there's of course , Walter , who really isn't the caretaker after all , but it's never explained who he is before he meets his demise either . I wouldn't call this the WORST film I've ever seen , not by a long shot . In fact , I'd say it was better than many of the " After Dark Horror Fest " films , but then again , I wouldn't consider than a recommendation . Still , it has its moments , and if you can get past the cheesy look , it's kind of a throw-back to some of the films I mentioned earlier , although , that's not really a recommendation , although I will confess to enjoying some of those to an extent . , some may like this more than others . . . but most will probably hate it .
505340	2911571	780485	5.0	Has its moments , but overall , it's not all that funny	Archie is a kindergarten teacher who is trying to invent an engine that runs on wheat grass . With gas at $32 a gallon , no one drives anymore . One day he accidentally cuts himself & when the blood gets into the wheat grass the engine starts and runs . Now all Archie , a vegan , has to do to test his engine , is kill a bunch of squirrels , birds , and even a few dogs , as we see him stalking the woods with his BB gun . But what works best , is humans , because there's obviously , more blood . So Archie rigs up a fan with knife blades in the trunk , and pop in a car-jacker , a disabled war vet ( less the plastic arm & legs ) and the occasional hitch hiker , and the car runs just fine . Archie has had a sort-of relationship with Lorraine , who runs the " Veg-table " stand at the playground , and from whom he's been buying his wheat grass . As soon as he has a car , he's pounced on by Denise , who runs the Meat stand at the playground right across from Lorraine . In exchange for getting to ride in a car Denise provides Archie with plenty of wild & kinky sex . In fact , since he has a car , ALL the girls want Archie . But so do the feds , who have been spying on him all along & THEY want the car . Of course , a few of them do wind up in the trunk but eventually Archie is apprehended , only to find that he's more a hero than a fugitive . This has a few laugh-out loud moments , and most of it is definitely in bad taste , all of which is fine with me . But the dark humor isn't quite enough to sustain the whole film , and a lot of it just kind of falls flat . Not really a bad effort but still , it's kind of amateurish . Some may , of course , like it more than others . .
505535	2911571	276744	5.0	OK , but tries a bit too hard to be " quirky "	No doubt about it that this is one weird movie , but there's something about the overall feel of it that didn't work for me . A young boy is left by his mom with his bail-bondsman dad while dad is working , enabling them to interact with all manner of weirdos , like Bananas the Clown ( Buscemi ) who is fresh from an encounter with his estranged wife in which she tried to run him down with a car . There's also some guy with a big RV who has a girlfriend that can't sing , a drug & drink-addled Santa ( the ever-loopy Peter Stormare ) that is a would-be kidney donor for the boy until he manages to escape the hospital , a trio of priests , one of which decides to hit a strip club , one of whom is arrested and carted off to jail , and a host of other low-lives and weirdos . Now this group of people all converge upon each other & wander around LA looking for the escaped would-be kidney donor , and havoc ensues . This has plenty of potential but to me it lacked something I couldn't put my finger on . I guess a lot of it just seems too forced , and it left me kind of cold at the end . , may appeal to others but to me only just OK .
505225	2911571	377707	5.0	an amazing film , in many ways , but a good film . . . ?	I've read lots of things about this marvelous piece of work but now I've finally seen it , and boy oh boy . . . . what a film . I guess the whole gist of the thing is that some giant storm hits Thailand and in some way uproots this giant crocodile , although later in the film , some mention is made of this being a mutant due to radioactive waste . So how it got to be big is a toss-up , I reckon . The fact that it IS big ( or is at least attempted to be portrayed as big ) is the problem as it munches its way through little villages and such . There is lots of footage that shows this croc ( k ) tottering along above the palm trees and for close ups , we have an obviously fake looking head , the better to show young topless Thai women getting munched upon , I guess . I think what I liked the best was that the crocodile's eyes light up at night , so it looks like there's a VW floating around out in the water somewhere , therefore : It must be a mutant . I kind of feel like parts of this movie just got skipped right over and it moves from scene to scene with no concept of continuity , but considering the quality of the entire film , it doesn't really matter . At times I thought I was watching a Godzilla re-hash , so remarkable are the special effects , and at other times I thought I was watching something along the lines of " What's Up Tiger Lily ? " since most of the dubbed voices are so ridiculous and inappropriate . Yeah , it is rather obvious this was an attempt to rip-off " Jaws " , but in the hands of someone who may well have been the Thai successor to Ed Wood Jr . it's hardly memorable . Is this good stupid fun ? I thought so . Is this a good movie ? HELL no , but if you like bad cinema you'll probably find plenty to enjoy here . .
504588	2911571	366555	5.0	horror comedy fluff	Can a horror comedy be called fluff ? Well , I'm calling this one fluff . The cover suckered me in , a young lady in a skimpy outfit with a chainsaw , and while she is the nicest thing to look at in the movie , well , let's just say I need to start bringing my glasses and actually READING the boxes before I buy movies . This is kind of The Evil Dead meets your basic scavenger hunt & " spend the night in a haunted house as a frat house / sorority house initiation " flick , and the scavenger hunt itself is actually more entertaining than most of the rest of the movie . As for the comedy parts , if you get big laughs from people biting their tongues off then this is right up your alley . I will admit this had a few good one-liners but overall it's a very fluffy movie , little of substance here & doesn't suffer overly from originality .
505685	2911571	94886	5.0	I like the clowns but the movie falls mostly flat	OK , I guess this is the film that got Victor Salva in trouble , with young boys in their undies and even a brief buttocks view . So what . If you like that kind of stuff then it may excite you , but it's thankfully brief ( no pun intended ) and probably more creepy than the rest of the film . The story is , that 3 brothers have gone to the circus , on the night that 3 escaped lunatics invade the circus clown's changing tent & assume their identities . And , since young Casey has a morbid fear of clowns , well , they seem to latch on to him . The oldest brother is played by a very young Sam Rockwell , I wouldn't have known it had it not been in the credits . The role of the " evil " Cheezo the Clown is played by wacko comedian Tree , whose stand-up act I saw on TV once , wow , was he a good choice to play a lunatic clown . Although , of course , he doesn't speak . The creepy clowns are good , and the creepy clowns stalking three kids left on their own in a big house are good , but the kids are so unlikeable that you hope the clowns DO get them . And because the kids are unlikeable , the film fell flat , for me . Anyway , if I'm going to watch a clown movie , " Killer Klowns From Outer Space " would be my choice , this one is rather mediocre . .
504489	2911571	86058	5.0	complicated revenge story	I was not sure what to expect from this when I watched it , but what I felt after seeing it was not that I'd just seen a great film . This was Sam Peckinpah's last , and while I'm not any fan of his I know he had done far better . John Hurt plays a CIA operative ( I guess ) and his wife is killed by order of the head honcho , as played by Burt Lancaster . Some time later , Hurt has devised a way to get back at his old boss via a TV talk show host , of sorts , as played by Rutger Hauer , who has a get-together at his place every year for some friends of his . However , these friends of his have now been presented to him as possible Soviet spies , and he's been shown taped footage ( that of course , only allows him to see seemingly incriminating conversations ) to prove that . So now he's housing some Soviet spies for the weekend and things turn tense and get out of hand , and so on . Meg Foster , who plays Hauer's wife , gets away with her son & their crossbows and comes back later for some target practice with the real thing . The rest of the guests pile into an RV and are heading for the hills but they won't get far . And then Hurt manages to kidnap Hauer's wife , son , & dog , in order to finally get what he really wants , to expose his old boss . It's not a bad story , I guess , but it's very confusing and complicated and completely lost me a few times , because ( I'm guessing here ) there are things that the film seems to assume that you know , as in , you've read the book by Robert Ludlum , which I hadn't . Of course , this was also Peckinpah's last film & if you know anything about him , he had his problems , and maybe this is the end result of some of that too , who knows . I wouldn't call this terrible , but it's certainly not very well executed and could have been far better in the right hands . .
504374	2911571	63145	5.0	A Magnificent Creature	Hey now , I saw this about a million years ago on Theatre X in Orlando , Florida , the Saturday afternoon monster / sci-fi movie show that made me what I am today ( warped ) . Somehow seeing it again on DVD isn't the same , because I'm a bit older now and it's pretty tame stuff , including the Magnificent Creature , The Mezosaur , as it's described by its owner , the " few fries short of a happy meal " farmer , and Tommy Kirk , the paleontologist . It's supposed to be many feet tall & some kind of lizard , but one never quite gets that feeling at all , since it comes out of a bubbly , red-lighted pond and it's some guy in a rubber suit that has ping-pong balls for eyes and and a nasty overbite . I still do enjoy a lot of the monster movies I liked as a kid , and it was good to see this again , although I couldn't begin to describe what makes me like this . The farmer has captured 2 wayward tourists and is holding them to feed to the monster , and Tommy Kirk too , as he was dumb enough to stumble into the trap . The farmer has a housekeeper who used to be a wayward tourist herself until she also stumbled into his little trap , but she somehow escaped being fed to the creature and got to stay on . This is cheesy as all-get-out , but I still enjoyed it well enough . .
505152	2911571	138304	5.0	good ideas , poorly done movie	This is a movie with some good ideas but they don't seem to get put across very well . While on a space mission two astronauts who are outside the space shuttle end up being taken over by some alien force . Upon their return to earth one eventually dies of a stroke but the other ( Johnny Depp ) survives to impregnate his wife . With what ? Who knows . Let's just play it safe and say " twins " . Depp is miscast as an astronaut with a Southern accent ( and not a good one ) . He has a pretty wide acting range and is a very talented actor but he fares much better as eccentric types than a straight role . After the incident Depp retires from his job and takes a job at an aerospace company in NYC , where he and his lovely wife appear to live in an office building , although technically I think it's an apartment . What an ugly place . Anyway Depp seems rather obsessed with listening to static on the radio , and lovely Charlize Theron seems quite worried about him . With good cause . An ex-NASA guy follows them to NY and tries to warn her but Depp manages to nip THAT in the bud , but not before she gets her hands on a video the guy left for her . I guess it's not any big surprise that this never made it to theaters , and in the right hands it may have been better , but as it is it's a pretty slap-dash movie , and seems to be nothing much more than some sketchy X-Files episode . Just longer and more excruciating . , it's not terrible but it's not good either .
504591	2911571	61329	6.0	stupid fun with Styrofoam	This film begins rather inventively as several different people are shown going about their jobs as time ticks off on the clock , and then it's quitting time and this bunch of people all converge on this building that seems to be some kind of garage , for they all come out dressed differently and on motorcycles and then out into the country side for a weekend of acid tripping and body painting and whatever else may come along . Their quest is seemingly a pyramid of acid ( sugar cubes I guess ) and it looks not much like a pyramid or cubes , but they go inside and it's like . . . a psychedelic warehouse or something , complete with a devil and lots of uh , trippy things . The devil wields cubes of LSD and the people approach him one by one to partake ( it's obviously chunks of Styrofoam , and you can especially tell when one person takes a bite , because you can HEAR it ) . Earlier on too , one young lady sinks in quicksand , but she's back later , huh . There's other goofy things like Native Americans appearing here & there , portrayed in less-than politically correct form , plus plenty of other silliness throughout . This is kind of a fun film in a stupid way , nothing too heavy here , maaan . Can't say this is 60's exploitation films at their best though . .
504364	2911571	780583	6.0	watchable & better than expected	I know it's not exactly a ringing endorsement to say " something wasn't as bad as I thought it would be " , but I had pretty low expectations for this and was surprised that it was actually watchable and better than expected . Of course , it's a bit far-fetched in many ways , zombies being one of them , and once the zombies start doing their thing there's enough firearms discharged and enough other things done to bring an aircraft down in pieces many times over , with no ill results . The basic story is that there's some kind of " special cargo " , that being the wife of a scientist , who is on the plane with his cohorts , and she's been given some kind of special serum , and the three of them seem to on the run from the authorities . Of course , you know that when the plane hits some turbulence the " special cargo " gets out , and bites , and those who are bitten get up and bite , and pretty soon the living dead are everywhere . The plane is supposedly only a quarter full , but there seems to be no end to the zombie stewardesses and passengers and those survivors that remain are of course , fighting to stay alive . A bit of a silly ending , but still , not bad overall , and the captain of our flight is no less than Raymond Barry , who played the sadistic loony in " Headless Body in a Topless Bar " . .
504744	2911571	91213	6.0	OK , but no high point for Penelope Spheeris	This could almost be a made for TV movie , to a point , and looks as though it was kind of quickly put together . Various members of the Hollywood Vice Squad , under occasional direction from Captain Ronnie Cox , bust hookers , drag queens , bookies , pimps , etc . Also a few johns here and there . One storyline involves a mother from the Midwest out to find her daughter , who's now a hooker and addicted to heroin . Another storyline involves an East Coast operation that has low level bookies afraid for their lives . Etc . , etc . Pretty standard stuff if you ask me , with plenty of " love-to-hate " stereotypes , like Frank Gorshin as the owner of an " escort service " . Also Carrie Fisher as an eager young detective manages to bust an S & M / porno movie maker . This is OK in a kind of mid-80's way but it's also pretty " by-the-book " and could have been churned out by anybody . Also a strange mixture of comedy and drama that doesn't always work . Anyway , if you like to make fun of California , the land of fruits and nuts , and haven't ever been there or lived there , this movie will give you plenty to hoot at . However , if you actually like decent movies you may well not care for it . And , if you go about your life without ever seeing it then I guarantee that you'll never regret not having seen it . .
504458	2911571	100991	6.0	undistinguished follow-up to " Tetsuo "	Hiruko the Goblin is a rather undistinguished follow-up to Tetsuo the Iron Man for this director . I guess you could call it a horror comedy , although it's really not that funny or horrific . It's pretty strange though , which is about its only saving grace , I guess . There is evidence that there's some kind of burial mound at a school that has been guarded for years , and due to circumstances one of the goblins is released and races around beheading people , only to have their heads show up on spider or crab-like bodies . Investigating all this is an archaeologist and the son of one of the people that has disappeared , and they race around with weird detection equipment and act frantic . I guess overall it's OK , it's just not what I'd expect from Tsukamoto at all , after seeing Tetsuo & Snake of June . It's more like a mindless throw-away type flick , the kind one used to watch in the summer a long time ago , and there's just not that much to it . Still though if you like Tsukamoto's films it's good to see at least once . .
504570	2911571	145091	6.0	one of the better " Mondo " films	Some of the material in these so called " Mondo " films is rather tame by today's standards , but I'm sure it was pretty strange to viewing audiences upon initial release . This particular one is narrated by George Sanders , and features such things as a secret " dueling club " in Berlin , where the object is to leave a scar on your opponent's face . It also has a lesbian nightclub in Paris , a female body builder that bends metal bars & tears a phone book in half while performing a song and dance routine , and Portuguese men hunting whales the old-fashioned way . . . with a row boat and hand-held harpoon . The big favorite here was Lapp women castrating reindeer with their teeth , and then the men of the group lassoing the object of their desire , and getting a bit rough with them , it seems , for not all of these women seem particularly willing . Were these guys not paying attention to what was happening with the reindeer in the previous scene ? Anyway , this is an entertaining , if not spectacular , " Mondo " , and worth seeing . .
504821	2911571	43539	6.0	five alive	" Five " is , I guess , the first " post-nuke " flick , in which we find a survivor wandering , looking for others , and she runs across a cabin where there are cups , and a fire , and then she finds the man that lives there . She's nursed back to health , and then , along comes a jeep with two more men in it , one black , one old . The old man may well be suffering from radiation poisoning & sleeps for days , but when he awakens he wants to go to the ocean , so everyone piles into the jeep & off they go , to find the fifth survivor , washed up on the shore . Things are not idyllic , for the final survivor , an explorer with a very odd accent , is rather a jerk & does not like the fact that the black man is treated as an equal ( remember , this is 1951 ) . The woman is pregnant but men being what they are , at least one has a go at her , but he doesn't get very far . The final survivor is also rather a trouble-maker , and convinces the woman to go with him to find her husband in the city , with dire results . An odd little film , not bad but not as not quite as good as I expected . Director Arch Oboler also went on to make " The Bubble " , which is a 3-D feature . Interesting , but not great . .
505349	2911571	820111	6.0	seems to be missing a certain something . . . .	Some kind of strange parasites have invaded Earth & ( as one gentleman explains ) " some came from the sea and some came from space " . These parasites invade humans and turn them into mutated fighting machines called " Necroborgs " . The Necroborgs battle each other to the death for the amusement of the parasites . A young man who works at a machine shop ( Yoji ) has found one of these parasitic things , that he thinks is dead . He keeps it in his closet at home but when he brings a young lady home that he fancies , it takes over her body & turns her into one of them there Necroborgs . Of course , Yoji eventually is infected by a crazy man who BREEDS Necroborgs so he can feed his partially-mutated daughter , and from there it's a battle of human will versus parasitic will . In some ways this is reminiscent of " Tetsuo " , without quite being like it . However , despite the special effects and wild action scenes , this film seems to lack a certain something that I can't put my finger on , that would have breathed some life , or given some soul to this film . It's nasty , violent , and at times , fairly disgusting , and it's fairly well-done as far as effects go , but otherwise it seems rather flat . Of course , some will like it more than others , and it's not exactly made for a wide viewing audience . .
505697	2911571	304722	6.0	just weird enough to raise it a notch above others of its type	I wasn't expecting much from this , especially considering that Warwick Davis , of the wretched " Leprechaun " movies , was in it . But once I got watching it I kind of got sucked in , and this has enough good old-fashioned weirdness to it that it's almost appealing . This has plenty of elements borrowed from Texas Chainsaw Massacre to it , but it does have enough going for it on its own that it's not entirely a rip-off . A family , who is on vacation , has car trouble ( of course ) and the father finds a diner run by a sweet old lady , and of course brings the rest of his family back there to her house across the road , which is inhabited by three freaks , one of whom has a giant brain , one of whom has a bear-trap for a face , or something like that , and the other of whom is a midget that throws plates . Yes , plates , as in dishes ? Of course , the whole family ( except for the daughter ) is slaughtered , and she's kept as a pet by the one with the giant brain ( who , by the way , is called Brain , although he claims his name is Brian ) . She , of course , tries to escape and almost does , managing to get out when some old biker types are at the diner ( the Ancient Ones , they're called , and the likes of which you may never seen in any biker movie ) . Of course she doesn't get away , the last remaining biker ( who stayed to enjoy his coffee ) is slaughtered , and so on . And more slaughter after that , with assorted weirdness . This is a Fangoria release , and it's not really too bad , although it falters at times . Just the idea of someone being pursued by a midget throwing lethal plates is enough to pique just about anyone's interest . Isn't it ? Well , maybe not . At any rate it's not as abysmal as I thought it would be and is just weird enough to raise it a notch about similar fare . .
505287	2911571	443594	6.0	Indian remake of " The Eye " is not bad , but brings nothing new	I rather liked this , but it's not much more than a remake of " The Eye " , the film from the Pang Brothers ( Jian Gui ) . A woman has a cornea transplant from an anonymous donor and when she realizes that she sees things that no one else can , she of course , becomes alarmed . Particularly when she sees another woman's reflection when she looks in a mirror . She and her psychiatrist boyfriend , Sameer , fly to India to find who the donor was , and it was a woman that the local villagers deemed a witch , because she could foretell death . I suppose technically , she could see the future , but death is what the future held , so therefore she was cursing people so that they died . This , of course , made her somewhat unpopular , until she finally did herself in . And Naina got her corneas . Until Naina & Sameer left for India from London , this all seemed rather routine stuff , but when in India the film became more interesting , and upon return to London , more interesting still , as Naina sees disaster coming but no one will heed her . It has been a few years since I saw " The Eye " , so I'd have to go back to see that one again to see how close it is to this version , but this film is still not bad , and worth seeing if you like Asian horror . This is not gory but more spooky than anything , as was the original , but I wouldn't just write it off as a terrible remake either . .
504562	2911571	52187	6.0	50's schlock / horror cheese	Let me say first off , that I like cheesy movies , especially far-fetched ones like this . Not that the films of today aren't far-fetched , but they did some pretty good reaching back in the 50's . A small group of people are shipwrecked on what they think is a deserted island , after a big storm ( which hit Surf City , of all places , woo hoo ! ) . They discover that they aren't alone though after finding footprints , and these footprints seem to indicate some kind of ritual ? As in the owners of those feet performed some kind of dance ( one , two , cha cha cha ? ) Then they find a woman on the beach , or at least the body of a woman with the face of a demon . Then they find the Nazis that are experimenting on these women . But of course , they stumble across the women first , and on this supposedly deserted island there's a bunch of white women performing native dances . . . . ? According to the credits these women are the " Diane Nellis Dancers " but till I saw that I was going to assume they were a bunch of strippers hired for the film , it looks like THAT kind of dancing . Of course they eventually get snagged by the Nazis while snooping around their labs , etc . etc . Pretty silly escapist stuff , definitely " midnight movie drive in " stuff , but kind of fun , in a stupid way . .
503901	2911571	222817	6.0	Sex and gore galore , with a generous helping of bad taste	An egotistic photographer and his ( mostly ) egotistic crew are on a film shoot with some young models , and when they're done and on their way back to the city they get lost in a fog and take refuge in some abandoned house . Of course , some of these models have become " respectable " by sleeping with this particular photographer , and he's not above sharing with his crew , so an evening of wild sex ensues . But nearby , some mud monster has arisen from the , uh , mud , and is stalking them all . I guess I could say that this is interesting in an " I can't believe I'm watching this " kind of way . I did get kind of tired of squeaky little Japanese girl voices though as they hung on the edge of orgasm for what seemed like hours , though . It is rather interesting , too , that most of these girls still call the photographer " sir " even while he's banging away at them . . . what a nice polite society Japan has . Anyway , once the mud man shows up , it's only a matter of time for everyone to enjoy life to its fullest , because mud man is both horny and hateful & after he has his pleasure he disposes of the receptacles . And just by their proximity , the guys get killed too . One young woman is apparently a nymphomaniac , and she always wants more , to the point where she makes good use of the severed arm of one of the dead . Ick . After the mud man has his way with her & she asks for more , he instead merely removes her innards with his hand , through her vagina . Double icky . Not quite sure what to think of this , really , but it's not terrible . It's too gruesome to be sexy , and too disgusting to be funny , although it is a bit amusing at times , again , in an " I can't believe I'm watching this " kind of way . .
504483	2911571	129797	6.0	obscure Florida vampire flick	Vampires , in Florida ? Well , it is Jacksonville , so almost not really even Florida . This story concerns the curse of the De Lorca family , which has something to do with the occult and vampires , and apparently rounding up a few young ladies to lure back to the ancestral mansion is a good way to make sure that curse is carried on , because one must bear a child , apparently . Beyond that I was quite lost , actually , because this has a high level of incoherence but is still someone interesting to watch despite its flaws . There's also a fortune teller , and some beast from the beyond , which sort of looks like a cross between a werewolf and an ape . That must be the occult part , because it doesn't seem very much in the vampire vein ( so to speak ) . Anyway , for a no-budget film with a no-name cast it's not totally abysmal , but it's not exactly top-notch either . Just another low-budget 70's obscurity that's worth at least a look , if not for the scares , at least for the " huh ? " value . .
504193	2911571	200940	6.0	for all its faults , it's still fairly inventive	I was rather surprised to run across this on DVD the other day , and since it was on my list of " Must Have " films , I snagged it . I'd never seen it before but how could any z-grade movie fan like myself pass it up ? By no means is this a well-made & professional film . It begins with some awful Claymation characters , which are martians in a tiny ship , who come to earth to see how humans have progressed , and they find Vernon , a wino , who is sleeping on a roof-top . So , obviously , they aren't impressed . The decide that perhaps they need to mate a human with a vacuum cleaner , and Vernon is the man . But strangely enough , even though Vernon falls in love with " Dusty " , the vacuum cleaner , they're , uh , both male . Dusty falls into the hands of a guy who needs a vacuum cleaner because his wife has complained that theirs just broke . So Dusty ends up at their house while poor Vernon is distraught that he's lost his love . When the unwitting housewife accidentally spills aphrodisiac tea on the floor and uses the vacuum to clean it up , well , of course she's attacked & ravaged by the vacuum cleaner , but she dies and her poor , voyeuristic hubby is dragged away to jail . And I said voyeuristic hubby , because he's been spying on the hot chick next door who does nude heavy-metal aerobics and leg-shaving in the window of her house . And she's stuck with a new-age-type boyfriend who wants to eat nothing but brown rice & do meditation , while she wants to eat burgers & rock and roll & @ $ # % like a bunny . And eventually , she sort of gets her wish , except her " lover " happens to be the naughty vacuum cleaner , which has found its way into the REST of the aphrodisiac tea and then has its way with her . There's a lot more ( and a lot less ) to this than what I've described , but that's the basic gist of it . Of course , this woman has been impregnated by the vacuum and gives birth to the first " vacusapien " . Etc . For all this film's shoddiness , it does still manage to be fairly inventive . The shots of the vacuum cleaner making its way down city streets with barely a glance from pedestrians is worth a few smirks . Also , the woman looking at a police line-up of vacuum cleaners is worth a laugh , too . Overall , it is a rather stinky film but it doesn't really pretend to be high art , either . Worth seeing for fans of utter trash .
505706	2911571	1031280	6.0	OK effort but isn't this kind of like " Feast " ?	Splinter involves the unexplained appearance of some kind of prick-like things that apparently perform somewhat like mold , according to the resident biology student that just happens to be trapped at a gas station with his girlfriend and some dangerous ex-con . The boyfriend & girlfriend are out camping , but have to give it up because the tent gets broken and they set out for a hotel , only to be carjacked by the ex-con & his doped-up girlfriend . While on their way somewhere they hit something in the road , one of these splintery things , apparently , which puncture a tire & the radiator , so they all end up at this gas station , where the doped-up girlfriend is promptly attacked by the former gas station attendant who has turned into one big prickly thing . So , the three surviving people hide out inside the gas station , occasionally visited by marauding prickly body parts & the usual possessed dead bodies banging themselves into bloody pulp against the glass . Overall , this isn't a bad little horror flick but it's somewhat derivative , it seemed , of Feast , only with less people . Isolated place under attack by mysterious critters , folks getting killed , etc . The possessed dead bodies & the prickly things aren't really shown very long or very clearly in order to get a good look at them ( as in with Feast ) . And of course , what's going on has no explanation . I won't say this is nothing you've never seen before ( couldn't tell , really ! ) but while it's an entertaining time-passer it's certainly not the future of horror . .
504532	2911571	68505	6.0	not the best of the Dracula lot , but still plenty enjoyable	Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee return in one of the many of the Hammer Dracula films , and this time they're in the early 70's in London . It seems one young man ( calling himself Johnny Alucard ) has taken the ashes of the fallen vampire back after Van Helsing seemingly killed him in the 1800's , and deposited them near hallowed ground , only to bring him back to life in the London of the 70's , with the usual blood-sucking results . We have a bunch of young people that like to hang out , drink , do drugs , and get up to mischief , and they are unwittingly drawn into the resurrection , resulting in plenty of dead bodies with a puzzling cause of death . Peter Cushing , though , as the descendant of Van Helsing , comes to the rescue & again manages to save the day . The best part of this film is the updating of the usual Gothic 1800's scenario , but this is by no means the best of the Hammer Dracula films . Still though , it's plenty enjoyable and worth seeing if you're a fan , and maybe even if you're not . .
505285	2911571	66160	7.0	entertaining werewolf / vampire flick	This is an entertaining werewolf / vampire flick , starring everyone's favorite Spaniard , Jacinto Molina , as Count Waldemar Daninsky . As usual , young damsels in distress come across him living in an old monastery , and choose to hang out with him , only to be there when an ancient vampire woman is released from her slumber , with the usual results . For a werewolf , Daninsky is certainly chivalrous about keeping his young guests free from harm of vampire bites , but he's not entirely successful , because Genevieve gets bitten and then comes back for her friend Elvira ( yes , really ) . Now , there's some atmospheric slow-motion bounding and bouncing when it comes to these beautiful vampires , and their hair looks so sleek , sassy , and full of body , that I thought at times I was watching a macabre shampoo commercial , but that's only a small complaint . Overall this is fairly decent and entertaining , as Naschy / Molina films go , and if you're a fan and haven't seen it , guaranteed you'll like it . .
505552	2911571	276935	7.0	short , weird , and noisy	I was surprised I'd actually seen one other movie by this director and it was " Angel Dust " which is quite unlike this one in every way . That one is more a thriller / mystery , quite creepy , this one is a " wham bam thank you ma'am " sort of comic book adventure , along the lines of Tetsuo meets Guitar Wolf or something . A young boy climbing an electrical tower is shocked and it's awakened a part of his brain that I guess is mostly dormant in most humans , that makes him rather aggressive . He was apparently an orphan or something , living in a group situation , because you see him break out in fights and then getting dragged to have another electro-shock session ( over and over , as he gets older ) . He finds solace in making lots of electric guitar noise though . There is a new guy in town , though , Thunderbolt Buddha , who wears half a Buddha head over his face and was apparently struck by lightning , and these two eventually face off in some huge and shocking ( he he ) battle . And noisy . This is all filmed in black and white and is quite odd , but it's also very short ( 55 minutes ) and was over with before I knew it and my thought was " that's it ? " . Well , it wasn't bad ; appealed to my sense of weirdness , but it seemed like it was lacking . . something , I can't put my finger on it . Still it was watchable and weird , and the " music " served to exact revenge on my downstairs neighbor for playing Bing Crosby Christmas music all weekend . .
504506	2911571	64691	7.0	A western dressed in sci-fi clothing , but a good one . . . .	I had never even HEARD of this film before it was released on DVD with " When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth " . This film begins with a jazzy theme song and animated opening credits which make it seem like it might be a comedy of sorts , but no , really it's a western dressed up in sci-fi clothing . It seems that one Bill Kemp ( James Olson ) , former Mars explorer and all around surly guy , now runs a passenger service for people on the moon , and he also ( with the help of his engineer , Korminski ) collects salvage to sell . It seems that he's been railroaded into helping a very rich man with highly questionable morals to " land " an asteroid on the dark side of the moon so that this man's thugs can get all the sapphires off of it . In the meantime though , one Clementine Taplin has come to Kemp , looking for his help in getting HER to the dark side of the moon so she can find her brother , who is a miner ( forty-niner ? ) who was supposed to meet her but hasn't been seen or heard from in a long time . And it's possible that the reason for that has something to do with Hubbard & his band of thugs , who want to land their asteroid in the general vicinity of her brother's mining operation . Olson does take Clementine on the trek , but what they find is not good , and they're also ambushed by Hubbard's men , but do manage to return to what passes for civilization on the moon . This is rather an odd change for Hammer , but still a fun little film , with more than a little sly humor thrown in . Bright colors , cool music , go-go dancing space gals in futuristic saloons , and even some folks playing Moonopoly ? Yes indeed . Not a great film but certainly a fun one , a space oater , I guess you could say , but thankfully minus the horses . .
504776	2911571	435678	7.0	ultra-high squirm factor	" Katiebird " takes a while to get going but when it does you will be squirming and cringing in your seat . It's right up there with " Scrapbook " for utterly uncomfortable viewing . While the director shows great promise there's some things about this that bugged me though and one is the music which is rather overpowering at times . The other thing is the split screen stuff which is kind of distracting at times . If you were uncomfortable with the " dentistry " scene in " Marathon Man " then look out , because some scenes here far eclipse any discomfort you may have felt there . This begins with Katiebird having a session with her psychiatrist , and she rather quickly dominates the situation , chaining him to a bed , and submitting him to all kinds of torture . This is sort of a wrap-around throughout the film . I guess the overall story ( as told in flashbacks ) is that Katiebird is a chip off the old block , her dad is a serial killer as was his father before him , and his father , etc . In fact they show these old geezers at one point and one actually waves at the camera , probably the only glimpse of humor in this whole film . Now dad has lovingly collected the tools of his trade , and when she becomes distraught because a boy she likes is seeing some other girl , he introduces her to the pleasures of torture and killing . And she takes to it like a duck to water . This is not a film for folks with weak constitutions , and may not be a film for a lot of other folks either . It's sick , it's disgusting , and it's vile . Having said that though , it's also worth seeing at least once if you have a sense of adventure . .
503990	2911571	65826	7.0	biker / Nazi / spy / pseudo-psychedelic drive in trash FUN	I'm not sure why I'm drawn to the films of Al Adamson but they always leave me a bit tired out , because they're so full of stuff and a wild mix of genres slapped together that they're super hard to follow and yet they have a certain charm . Maybe in some ways it's the music , I don't know . This one is about bikers who are in cahoots with a re-united Nazi party , and a Nazi War Criminal , and an agent for Israel who is after him , and a double agent who works for the syndicate AND the FBI , and a counterfeit ring , and who knows what all else I might have missed when I blinked . The Nazi Party is , of course , running the counterfeit ring which is in the secret basement of some shack in the woods and consists of two fat German guys in aprons that are using a hand press and hanging up fake $20 bills on clothes pins to dry , and with this they're going to achieve world domination ? There's lots of abrupt clothing changes , hairstyle changes , and scenario changes , like at one point this woman is about to be ravaged by the bikers and runs out into the road in torn clothes , and the next scene she's dressed differently and driving her cool Mustang Fastback and looks like none of that ever happened . Mark Adams is the FBI plant in The Syndicate which of course operates out of Las Vegas in a hotel room with cheesy hanging lamps , bad paintings , and of course , a bar . And gosh , Broderick Crawford is in this too , playing to usual sort of Broderick Crawford role . Not to mention Scott Brady , who made a career out of being in bad movies . For the right viewer , this is awe-inspiring and quite entertaining in ways other than was intended . However , for someone that's perhaps seeking a good biker movie , or perhaps even just a good movie period , well , this probably isn't it and you should avoid at all costs . I thought this was just one more example of Al Adamson's uh , unique talents , and I loved it . .
505140	2911571	64939	7.0	actually quite good , as bad biker flicks go . . .	In the intro to this Sam Sherman , who was one of Al Adamson's buddies and partners , calls " Satan's Sadists " the " Citizen Kane " of biker movies , and I wouldn't go so far as to call it that , but this is higher than usual quality Al Adamson stuff , maybe because it was shot in 10 days with no splice-and-dice and welding together of other totally different films like usual ? Uh , maybe . Russ Tamblyn plays " Anchor " a sadistic biker gang leader , and he has some swell pals along with him , like " Acid " ( Greydon Clark ) and Firewater and a few others . Now these biker dudes stir up trouble at some remote roadside café and harass and eventually kill a couple of tourists , while the hitch hiker that rode in with those same tourists takes to the hills with the waitress from the restaurant and they're running for their lives ( well , moseying , is more like it ) with the bikers in pursuit . And , as with most good / bad biker movies , the bikers either turn on each other or kill themselves in other moronic ways while the good guys , well , you know . Anyway this has some fairly groovy music ( but would self-respecting bikers listen to it ? Maybe not . . ) and it also has some pretty decent scenery and seems almost like a professionally done , if low budget , outing . Probably one of the best movies Adamson ever puked out , .
504175	2911571	64902	7.0	The first " Sex-Horror " film ? Well , not really , but still interesting	Blood Rose is sort of a remake of " Yeux Sans Visage " ( Eyes Without a Face ) . The story is that of a man who has married the woman of his dreams only to have her horribly burned and scarred and then finds a former doctor to restore her . Howard Vernon plays the part of the former doctor who went to prison for his attempts to operate on a child many years previous , and who is actually quite reluctant to participate in this new venture . This begins almost like a fairy tale , with voice-over narration . Of course , lots of potential donors are required for this particular operation and young ladies are lured to the château for this purpose . The burn victim is never shown entirely , just her eyes in some scenes , or filmed from the back , which is just as well , thanks . This has a good atmosphere & is fairly interesting but seems to lack some focus , and there's really not much sex to go with the horror . There are two strange little men , Igor & Olaf , that are the servants of Frederic , the tortured artist , that lend some extra weirdness to the film . This isn't particularly scary but it does have some creepy moments and is not at all bad . And what exactly is the Blood Rose ? Well , I thought it was a plant that was introduced early in the story that has thorns that secrete poison & is responsible for the death of one person in the film , but that's just dropped and never heard from again . ? ? Overall though , not bad , if kind of derivative . Now available on DVD from Mondo Macabro . .
504710	2911571	369359	7.0	Mad Cow Disease Zombies	When you think about it , the idea that people eating tainted meat and becoming zombies is really more realistic than a space probe returning from Venus and spreading radiation with the same basic results . That is , if flesh eating zombies were realistic to begin with . A good idea but a pretty low budget , and not that much different really from Night of the Living Dead , despite the Irish location and actors . I guess nailing zombies with a cricket bat is kind of cool though . A woman and her boyfriend or husband are on the road , on vacation , when they hit a man , and when the put him in the back of their car to take him to a town , he suddenly sits up and removes a chunk of the driver's neck , therefore causing him to become a zombie . . . of course the woman is having none of this and runs for her life , where she meets up with a young man ( a gravedigger , to be exact ) . Eventually they hook up with a man & his wife in a jeep , all the while trying to get to safety . I think I'm going to give this one another chance and watch it again but as much as I wanted to like this I found it to be only so-so . The makers of the film seemed to give a couple nods to Romero here & there , but overall this is low budget and amateurish , and at times the Irish accents are almost indecipherable . OK , but only close , no cigar . .
505669	2911571	109838	7.0	oozing with sarcastic humor	I've only read about this until it came out on DVD so i grabbed it . This is pretty funny in a sarcastic way , as only maybe Alex Winter ( Bill & Ted's E . A . ) could do , and supposedly under all that makeup there is Keanu Reeves too . A major star ( Winter ) is hired by a toxic fertilizer manufacturer to give a better image to their product in South America , for 5 million dollars , so off he goes , and ends up in a Freak Show run by Randy Quaid where all the freaks have been created by coating them with this particular fertilizer ! Mr . T plays a bearded lady with just the right amount of delicacy , and there are lots of other goofy freaks too , like Bob Goldthwait as Sockhead , a kind of cookie monster wanna-be . This is a rather hard movie to describe but mostly everything is thrown at the viewer and it's up to you to decide how to take it . There's a few good laughs and lots of gross-outs , but the run time is kind of short . .
505394	2911571	848557	7.0	Not the shocker we might expect , but Romero IS 68 years old . . .	I'm not quite sure what people were expecting from this film , but I found it to be to MY liking . It's certainly no " Dawn of the Dead " but I thought it was well done & had its share of chills . The story : A bunch of college students filming a horror movie hear reports of the dead rising , etc . , so they all pile into a Winnebago to try to get home . One is filming everything with a camera , documenting the events to put online so that people can see the truth , since of course , the beloved government is censoring what's going on so the public doesn't get upset . Seems like everyone's more in danger of getting et than upset . There's not excessive gore & such but it's still there & it's enough , believe me ( at least for me it was ) . As events unfold and as the group dwindles , the feeling of hopelessness grows . There's some eerie moments as the remaining people band together in a big mansion that has a surveillance system & some of the action takes place on these cameras , which lends a detachment to some of the horror . This isn't a kick-ass zombie flick but Romero hasn't lost his touch . Expecting another " Dawn of " or " Night of " from him is unreasonable , just like expecting Cronberg to kick out another " Scanners " or something . I liked this . .
504834	2911571	362387	7.0	The Odd Couple Meets Texas Chainsaw Massacre ? ( minor spoilers )	This is a very strange little flick about two young actresses , living in the same luxury apartment not by choice , but because they've been placed there by their employer . They're both auditioning for a role in the movie " Yakuza Wives " and there's a slight bit of tension between them . One is from " hicksville " ( Sado Island ) and the other is a city gal , who spends money like it was going out of style . At first they're somewhat civil to each other on the surface , but you also get to see their true thoughts about various situations . After several minor spats over the use of shampoo , leaving hair in the bathtub , and other little indiscretions , things begin to spiral out of control and it's all out war . Sometimes subtle , sometimes quite in-your-face , especially when it comes to bathroom cleaner . There IS actually a chainsaw in this movie but it doesn't do any bodily harm , mostly thanks to a short extension cord . This is a pretty dark comedy and also has elements of drama and horror as things escalate toward the ironic ending . You'd not think young ladies in Japan could be so vicious but these two are top-notch in that field . This is a fairly fascinating film but it's not for everyone . .
504103	2911571	296042	7.0	Icky the killer	Hey now , I will admit that I thought the blond guy on the cover was Ichi for a while but once I realized who he was I enjoyed the movie more . It seems there's an issue with a Yakuza guy that ran off with a bunch of money , and of course everyone is looking for him . And then there's Ichi , who somehow figures into all this . Ichi is this little milquetoast guy who gets violent when he gets upset . He gets REALLY violent . Anyway he's supposedly out for revenge on people that had bullied him when he was younger but it seems he's rather impressionable and that's not exactly what's going on at all . This film has some rather icky moments , as in gore galore , and there's even someone that literally splits . . . . . . . amazing . The blond gentleman pictured on the cover has a rather interesting mutilation that allows him to open his big mouth when he chooses . . . . . which is quite the ghastly effect . Overall this was a decent movie but it was a bit hard to figure out who was who for a while and in the opening the editing is quite confusing but once everything settles down a bit this becomes quite an interesting film . Miike did much better with Audition though , and I'd prefer that over this if I had to choose .
504433	2911571	195614	7.0	if you can get past the cheesy look , it's actually a rather good horror omnibus	Years ago I bought Cremains on VHS , and it was the wrong movie inside . I returned it to the store & got a replacement with the same result , so I got something else instead . And forgot about it . Now , about 7 years later , I found it at a used store on DVD so I thought I'd try this again . To me , things filmed on video ( instead of film ) always have a incredibly cheap and cheesy look , and most things I've seen filmed that way are not worth seeing , but I was pleasantly surprised that behind the cheap look , this isn't a bad film at all . It begins with a brief little " skit " that's really not worth mentioning , and then there's a man in a suit being grilled by some voices ( you never see the people ) about something he'd done . He's an undertaker , and he has apparently mixed someone's remains with those of someone else , and for that , he's being detained . . . somewhere . The first real story is of a young woman meeting her dad at some café , and then following him to wherever her mom is hospitalized , but they become separated on the road & she ends up in the town of Wyndham , Mississippi , where once in a blue moon ( which it happens to be ) , the town folks select someone for a special " honor " . There's also a tale of a young man kidnapped by someone who he thinks sounds " very familiar " , and it's eventually revealed that this particular man is using his job as a means of preying on those who are troubled . And , there's also a woman lawyer who has lost her child , who is approached by a woman she represented in court a couple years previously , who happens to be a witch , who has told her that she can make things like they used to be . Meaning , bring back her dead child . Of course , you know that this sort of stuff never works right . Too bad her child was the one that the undertaker co-mingled with someone else's ashes , and that someone happened to be a killer . Despite the sometimes-low production values , and the sound , and the look , this still manages to be a worthwhile film for fans of B-movies . I was prepared to be disappointed but was quite surprised that the stories were as good as they were . Of course , the acting isn't top notch but all involved did a pretty good job for a low-budget independent feature . .
505647	2911571	114323	7.0	food for thought , but a very slow film	This is a rather slow moving and quiet movie about a woman who gradually begins to lose her tolerance for chemicals and toxins all around her . Julianne Moore plays the timid housewife who is beginning to react strangely to her environment and become ill , despite the fact that her doctor really can't find much wrong with her . Xander Berkeley plays her puzzled husband , with all the gusto he usually give to his roles , he's just kind of an ordinary guy . As time goes by Carol ( Moore ) does some research and finds a place in New Mexico that is for people like herself that can no longer tolerate their environments and goes there to stay . The founder of this place is a man who also found he had this problem but since he helps others ( for a fee ) his house is nicer ; everyone else lives in cabins . The gatherings of the afflicted ones here become something like a 12-step program complete with the usual get-up-and-dance to oldies stuff , which is actually a rather tired cliché . This is a slow moving film , and at times a VERY slow moving film , but it is food for thought and a little scary at times : really makes you think about how much in the way of toxins are around you in everyday life and what if . . . ? This is a pretty low-key movie compared to other stuff I've seen from this director ( Todd Haynes ) but while I don't think it's any great success it certainly made me think . .
505587	2911571	63549	7.0	weird Euro Trash with cool music	Part of the joy to me of Italian films is their incoherence , and this is no slouch in that department . We have a hideous hag of a woman , who's a doctor , no less , a scientist , to be more exact , and she steals a formula from her boss and turns into a beautiful young woman . The problem is , she doesn't stay that way for very long so she stocks up on the formula and then assumes the role of a dead gangster's girlfriend in order to steal lots of money , or something . This is quite trashy and has bits of horror to it but it's more a sort of espionage kind of thing more than a horror movie , although that's not quite it either . The music is groovy with lots of twangy guitar and plenty of lounge lizard type stuff , so I loved that . The storyline is fairly thin and the action is scatter-shot , but overall I rather liked this as a whole . I'm a bit confused with what I read about this as the main character was supposed to be something along the lines of Diabolik and I didn't see that at all , but I still liked this . More or less . The Retro Media release features some skips in the film and it appears little bits were missing but overall that didn't detract a whole lot from the film . , not for all tastes .
504835	2911571	323630	7.0	An interesting premise ( maybe a minor spoiler )	An investigative reporter is plagued by phone calls and changes her number and relocates to a big empty house owned by her sister and brother-in-law , after writing some articles that exposed public figures for doing naughty things . Apparently the phone calls haven't stopped though , because her niece picks up the phone while the woman and her sister are at a museum , and whatever she hears sends her off the deep end . The key seems to be the identity of the person that had this particular phone number previously . This is a fairly decent film that uncovers dark secrets where there don't appear to be any , and some of the revelations are quite surprising . The niece is a cute little thing , until she gets one of her " spells " and then she becomes the child from hell that puts many of the other " child from hell " films I've seen to shame . Some decent twists and turns make this worthwhile , but it could have been a little better , I thought . Perhaps I wasn't in the mood when I watched it , but it's by no means a bad film . .
504195	2911571	66847	7.0	decent 60's Filipino horror offering	A NY sex-crimes expert heads to the Philippines to help out an old friend , who is investigating some strange murders of women in the Manila area . Seems that the victims have been drained of blood & that a lot of the women all seem to work at this night club called " The Barrio " . Adamm Rourke ( Robert Winston ) poses as a writer to avoid being pegged as a cop , and manages to meet with the owner of the night club , who seems a bit concerned that his employees are disappearing , but he's also a rather strange man , and he guards his privacy heavily . Of course , he's assisted by two men who look after his interests . One of the women at the night club , the star attractions , seems to have some secrets of her own , too , and there is definitely something strange about her , considering the arm bands she wears , which seem to be from some ancient culture . Eventually , with the help of some unlikely allies , Roarke gets to the bottom of what's going on , and we get to see the strange creature that we've seen several times earlier in the film , who mostly has been lurking in trees and such , just before pouncing on victims . It's something along the lines of " Attack of the Mushroom People " , but still , it's kind of cool . This film has a decent atmosphere to it , and the " Something Weird " release ( with Blood Suckers ) is surprisingly clear and crisp . This film was actually made in 1965 but not released in the US till the 70's . If you enjoy Filipino horror films , then this is possibly one of the better ones . .
505500	2911571	760187	7.0	there you go again . . . . .	" The Tripper " is sort of a fun throw-back to the 80's slasher flick , with hippies ( of the modern sort ) who have gone to attend a music festival in the redwoods ( Humboldt County , CA , I believe ) and there's someone out there in a Ronald Reagan mask who is acting out his dislike for tree-hugger types . . . with an ax . This has a good atmosphere to it and some decent humor , although it does seem a bit strained at times . A van full of drug-addled kids has arrived for this music festival , and one of them , Sam , has just gotten out of a bad relationship with her boyfriend , who is a rather possessive and well , conservative type . Of course , the woods in this part of the country are full of surprises , nasty ones too , and an old hermit-type warns the kids about wandering into pot fields and watching out for traps . . . although he himself doesn't last much beyond his warning . The mayor of this little logging town is adamant that this festival will go on because it will bring in money , the organizer of the festival ( Paul Reubens ) is adamant that this will go on because HE wants money , but the sheriff wants the whole thing shut down because people keep getting killed in fairly nasty ways . The prelude to this film will show you approximately who is responsible for what's going on but the problem for the viewer is that you don't know which person represents the " grown up " version of one particular unbalanced child at the beginning . But that's fine , it gets revealed when it's supposed to be . And there's even an ironic twist to this particular person being on the loose , which dates back to something Reagan did in California in the 70's . A rather fun , if derivative , film , best enjoyed by people who like slasher flicks & don't like Republicans , although many references will probably sail right over some people's heads . .
504765	2911571	388395	7.0	slow moving but ultimately rewarding	Schultze is a retired salt miner in Germany , in a small town in the former DDR . He is at loose ends with his retirement , as his wife is in a nursing home & his friends that were retired with him don't have much more exciting going on in their lives . One day Shultze hears Cajun music on the radio and picks up his accordion ( he's a polka musician too ) and tries his hand at it . He has an ear for music so pretty soon he's obsessed with Cajun culture and even tries his hand at Jambalaya for his buddies . Pretty soon Schultze is working odd jobs to raise some money to go to Louisiana but before he can he's sent as a representative of his town to their " sister city " of New Braunfels , Texas . After fleeing the music festival there ( maybe it was the polka version of " La Paloma Blanca " ? ) he appropriates an old boat & makes his way into the bayous where he finds some unlikely friends and gets a taste of music and culture first hand . This is pretty slow moving at times but try to stick with it . The ending is a bit downbeat but the trip there is worth it . .
504403	2911571	107302	7.0	your basic psycho road picture	David Duchovny and Michelle Forbes play a young journalist couple who want to go to California , but can't really afford to , so they ' ride share " with another young couple ( Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis ) to save on expenses . The idea is for them to stop at various murder sites along the way , sites where serial killers did their thing , since Brian ( Duchovny ) is a writer and Carrie ( Forbes ) is his photographer . What they don't know is that Pitt ( Earley ) and Lewis are serial killer and girlfriend who just goes along with whatever HE says . I don't care for Pitt as a rule but he does justice to psycho roles . The scary thing is that he does them so well ; I've actually KNOWN people like him before , no , not killers , but with pretty much the same mindset . Anyway , as the road trip goes along , Carrie guesses that the others are about out of money , but Earley seems to always come up with the cash somehow . . . . never mind that he leaves someone dead here and there to do it though . Lewis does her role well , one that she excels at , a not-too-bright waif that has a good heart but doesn't understand that she doesn't have to put up with being beaten up by Earley when she does something he doesn't like . As things begin to get more unacceptable Carrie insists that the other couple be put out at a gas station , and unfortunately it's at that point where she's inside that she sees a news bulletin that tells her exactly who they've been ride-sharing with , after which things go downhill for them at a rapid clip . This is not the greatest flick in the world , but it's not bad . . . I watched what was supposed to be the ' unrated ' version but I wonder how much was cut out of the rated version , because this seemed fairly tame to me , really . . . not that this makes it family fare or anything , unless it's maybe the Manson Family . .
504528	2911571	70464	8.0	an extremely surreal treat	I hadn't seen much of Malcolm McDowell's earlier work in films , only Clockwork Orange , so I was curious to see what else he'd done earlier on in his career , and along came " O Lucky Man ! " . What a great film . McDowell plays Michael Travis , a young man who works for a coffee company and due to circumstances ( of the extreme kind ) ends up working for an extremely rich man and then ends up in prison , only to find himself penniless and on the street in London . There are all sorts of interesting adventures that he wanders through on the way , and it's all done in sort of a deadpan humor , with occasional musical breaks by Alan Price and his band . Fans of British TV & film will find several familiar faces here . McDowell moves through his adventures with a sort of calm naivety , no matter what happens , and he is often taken advantage of , but still manages to keep his good attitude . This may not be for everyone since the humor is rather dry at times , but it's a good satirical look at society and morals and a very interesting movie . .
505589	2911571	83844	8.0	lives up to its almost " legendary " reputation	I caught most of the " made-for-TV " horror films back in the 70's but I guess I must have been busier in the 80's because I missed this one and just now had the opportunity to see it . This is a film that is highly sought after by those who remember it , I guess , and it does live up to its reputation too , because for a made-for-TV movie it's pretty well done and rather creepy . A family moves to a new home , and apparently it's a " fresh start " so they can forget about what happened in the past and move on . Moving into their new house with them is Grandma ( Ruth Gordon , playing one of her usual eccentric characters ) and someone else that only daughter Mary can see , her dead sister , Jennifer . Now , it seems like dad ( Dennis Weaver ) has a bit of a drinking problem , and that perhaps that's part of why Jennifer isn't around anymore , and there are some vague flashbacks to what happened , which was apparently a car accident . Jennifer says that she misses her family and wants to be with them , but she means to bring them over to HER side and she enlists Mary's help . First Grandma dies after finding an iguana in her bed , then brother Kevin falls from the roof trying to get his Frisbee , and so on . Seems that Mary doesn't so much miss her family as want revenge on them for her death . For a made-for-TV movie this is well done but it's not without a few faults , like Mary apparently stalking her mother with a pizza cutter , which seems rather ridiculous . But overall it is a fairly creepy and strange flick and well worth seeking out if you can find it . .
504786	2911571	382810	8.0	what a tangled web we weave	Despite the fact that this is not exactly an uplifting film , I liked it a lot , and believe me , a film doesn't have to be uplifting for me to like it . But some may find it a downer . Cate Blanchett plays a young woman who has kicked the heroin habit and works at a video store in an Asian part of Sydney . The temptation is always around though , and even her brother is into drugs , although their mom doesn't seem to realize it . The brother ( Ray ) lost a leg to an accident a few years earlier that was caused by Jonny , a Vietnamese immigrant who has been living in Canada for a while to " clean up his act " but who still seems rather vague about his life and current activities , with good reason . Tracy ( Blanchett ) has tried to secure a loan at a bank for the expansion of the shop but has been turned down due to her " colorful past " , but she doesn't have the heart to tell her partner Ming . There's also Lionel ( Hugo Weaving ) , a has-been soccer star who is heavy into heroin and also has a rather interesting relationship with his connection , as played by Sam Neill , who seems to prefer to spend his days golfing and having his way with young men . Out of all this seemingly tangled mess comes an offer from Jonny to help Tracy get the money she needs for the shop expansion and it's all seemingly above board because Jonny is a stockbroker . . . . so he says , but in calling at his office she finds otherwise . So some money is removed from Tracy shop with the idea of increasing it by way of a complicated drug deal , which of course doesn't go as planned by any means . This is a rather complicated movie , but well acted and quite interesting , although it doesn't exactly zip along at a breakneck speed . Blanchett is excellent in her role as one who feels trapped in her life but she's not alone in these feelings , by any means . Hugo Weaving is also excellent as the has-been soccer star and former love interest of Tracy , who also has the dubious distinction of getting her onto heroin in the first place , which doesn't exactly make him a hero in her mom's eyes . An excellent drama from down under and well worth seeing . The music is also excellent and provides a rather dream-like quality to the film at times . .
503935	2911571	260494	8.0	The hairy beasts are back	Veerana has just been released on DVD in the US , and I just watched it last night and have to say that it was enjoyable , but not quite as good as anticipated . The tale is that of a witch , hanged for her crimes many years ago but given new life by a black magician . A man taking his daughter back to school in the city is passing through a remote area and his car breaks down , and when he goes to get water he finds his daughter has been taken & used in a ceremony to transfer the evil spirit of this witch into the young girl , Jasmin . Dad disappears , but Jasmin shows up at the door of her uncle's house with " Baba " in tow , who claims he found her lost & he also becomes part of the household . Jasmin is obviously not right though , and strange things begin to happen , and after the demise of her mother , her sister , Sahila , is sent to live with her grandmother in Mumbai . Many years later , sister & new boyfriend ( and a bumbling horror writer ) come back to visit , and while Jasmin is older , things aren't much better . Jasmin seems to enjoy luring men to a remote mansion and doing very bad things to them . And her uncle's household is in an uproar . Of course , with the help of Sahila's new boyfriend and the goofy " horror director " Hitchcock , all is resolved , eventually . The effects are typical Ramsay Brothers stuff . . . . forked lightning , garish makeup , and yet , there are some interesting touches , like these zombie things sitting around a table in a cave that are part cone-head & part tree-trunk . . . very weird . I like what I've seen of the Ramsay Brother's films a lot , so far , and this is definitely entertaining and fun . But I would have to say that I like earlier films like " Purana Mandir " and " Hotel " better . Still though , if you're a fan of Indian horror , and I'd say there weren't many of us , you'll probably enjoy this film . There's the usual mix of horror , comedy , and music and dancing , which seems odd to westerners , but that's the way it is , take it or leave it . I'll take it . .

OK , this is not a great film , but it is quite interesting , really , being the first ever horror film made and released in Pakistan . The DVD of this has special features that have interviews with the cast and crew that give some background on this . At any rate , what we have is a mad scientist discovering the secret of eternal life and becoming a vampire by drinking a potion he's made . From there on out it's relatively the same story that we're all familiar with but with a few twists here and there . We have some interesting musical interludes too , one of which features a female vampire performing a rather seductive ( ? ! ) dance to an instrumental surf tune , which is somewhat akin to someone suffering some sort of fit . The musical interludes fare much better when dancing to traditional Eastern type music though , although you can see the Western influence in the clothing in this at certain times . The film was considered lost but found and restored so there's a few parts that are a bit jumpy or the sound isn't quite right , but those are pretty minor and this is well worth seeing out of curiosity if nothing else . There's also a dance number with some young ladies frolicking on a beach but this is Pakistan ? Are they frolicking near an irrigation canal ? Who knows . Overall this is kind of fun and more a novelty here in the US really , than a horror film . It's not very scary and yet it's still quite interesting considering the time and place it was made . Worth seeing if you like foreign horror films . .
504466	2911571	64789	8.0	Venus in Furs = Paroxismus ? Okay . . . . .	I guess I never knew the " real " title of this , I remember seeing , back in 1969 or 1970 , a film called " Venus in Furs " advertised in the Denver , CO , newspaper , rated X , and at the tender age of about 12 I wondered what that was , now I'm not sure it was even this film . Whatever , shut up , write the review . This is one strange and surreal story . James Darren stars as a trumpet player who is obsessed with this woman , who is supposedly dead but keeps showing up . They meet in Istanbul , he goes to Rio , they meet up again there , etc . Seems that there was some ritual committed by Ahmed ( Klaus Kinski ) , Olga , and some other dude that left her either very injured or quite dead , and you're never really sure because she's still hanging around . I guess you'd say she was out for revenge from beyond the grave . At any rate , this is one of Franco's better films , done during what was probably the height of his career , when he still knew what the difference was between kinky and surreal , and just plain disgusting ( Tender Flesh ) . Also , this has some of the best music in any Franco film I've heard since Vampyros Lesbos , and quite often the musical accompaniment in his films is worth the " price of admission " by itself . stars .
504865	2911571	69747	8.0	fun stuff	This is a fun movie and I guess you could call it madcap , screwball , zany , whatever , it's fun . I had never heard or seen Louis De Funes prior to this ( and he's been deceased for about 23 years now ) but he seemed quite the master of the inappropriate facial expression . As in , making faces ? The gist of the story is that M . Pivert is on the way to his daughter's wedding ( with his boat strapped to the top of his Citroen ) when he runs afoul of traffic ( first ) and a political conspiracy ( second ) . Seems that M . Pivert is rather a racist as well and fires his driver when he finds out he's Jewish . Meanwhile , beloved Rabbi Jacob leaves NYC to fly to Paris to see his French family , and followers , and it's been 30 years since he visited there . Little did he suspect he'd be caught up in this wild conspiracy and case of mistaken identity , for to hide from his pursuers , M . Pivert and his newfound sidekick Slimane have mugged a pair of rabbis in the washroom and dressed like them to avoid capture . Of course the folks showing up at the airport to meet Rabbi Jacob have mistaken them for the real thing so off the go back to the neighborhood to improvise their way out of uncomfortable situations . Also of note is that M . Pivert first encounters his pursuers in an abandoned chewing gum factory and of course at one time or another they all end up in a vat of green goo . There are moments of this where I just laughed out loud ( by myself ) and overall I enjoyed this a lot . Highly recommended and yes , it's even OK for the whole family . .
505230	2911571	217331	8.0	Horror comedy succeeds where so many other don't	I don't necessarily like horror / comedies , because they're generally pretty lame and a waste , but this one somehow manages to succeed where most don't , and why ? I'm not really sure , but to me , it does . We begin with a young lady in a Catholic school uniform setting nuns and a priest on fire and shooting them , all to the strains of Leslie Gore in the background . Now THAT'S the way to start a film . Fast forward to the present in which a bunch of college frat / sorority types are going to this abandoned convent to smoke dope and raise hell . Boy do they ever ( both ) . Seems that the convent is now haunted by evil spirits and they're after a virgin to bring the Antichrist into the world , and they have quite a selection to choose from . Unfortunately for the evil spirits , there are some fruity devil worshippers afoot ( one of whom works at Dairy Queen , the first victim points out before her demise ) , and they unwittingly set things in motion . The stop-motion glow-in-the-dark zombie things are cool , and one snotty cheerleader-type even gets her face ripped off . Somehow even when one is watching the " scary " parts there's a sense of humor to this , and a tip of the hat to the film makers for managing somehow , to pull this off so well . Oh , and to put a stop to all this one girl escapes and runs to the house of the " crazy lady " who started this all 40 years ago , and they go to battle with the forces of evil . Yay . OK , so this is kind of stupid and goofy but in a way that actually oozes with fun , and while it's not scary particularly , it does make for a very entertaining watch . , well worth seeing .
504176	2911571	416282	8.0	Excellent Creepy Bollywood Horror	Vaastu Shastra is probably one of the best Indian horror films I've seen , of the modern variety , anyway . A couple move into an isolated house with their young son Rohan and the wife's college-age sister . Not long after they move in the son begins to act oddly and seems to be listening or seeing something that no one else can see . He claims to have two little friends and his parents think they're imaginary until strange things begin to happen . Seems that a banyan tree in their yard has something to do with all this too . People soon begin to die , including a maid who was mean to Rohan , and eventually even the wife's sister & her boyfriend , before all HELL breaks loose . This is a rather thrilling horror film ( for Bollywood ) and even boasts some pretty creepy zombie-things . There are bits and pieces of this story that remind me of other films but I can't quite put my finger on what they are , although the creepy big dead tree brings to mind " Poltergeist " . Not bad at all & well worth seeing , .
504105	2911571	312843	8.0	Mail Me	My my my , the Japanese don't mess around when it comes to the portrayal of nasty things , and this movie is no exception . From the opening scene of 54 school girls taking a dive onto railroad tracks and the resulting blood bath , this film almost never lets up with the nasty imagery and icky things . A wave of suicides has hit the country and police are baffled as to the cause . About mid-point it seems the mystery is solved when a group takes credit for the mass suicides but by no means is this over . All the while we're treated to the innocuous pop music of Dessart ( which is spelled several different ways in the movie ) , a band of young girls with a big hit song ' Mail Me ' that may or may not figure into what's going on . Overall this is one wild ride of a film and takes everyday things and turns them into nightmares . Highly recommended and worth seeing , but bring a strong stomach with you .
505258	2911571	182996	8.0	cheesy but rather fun favorite of mine , now on DV	Despite what doesn't show on IMDb , " Don't Go In The Woods " ( Alone ) has just been released on DVD . This has been a favorite of mine for years and oddly enough the DVD box notes say that it was intended as a comedy ? Hmm , well , I guess you'd have to be in the right frame of mind ( as in , wasted ? ) to think that , but I dunno , maybe on some levels it does work as sort of a twisted comedy . Lovely Utah settings , nasty thing in the woods killing folks , I mean , nothing spectacularly different about this , really , but to me it's always had a sort of appeal that is hard to explain . The nasty thing in the woods is some crazy man who shops at the local " Hills Have Eyes " boutique for his ensembles , and also chases folks through the woods and hacks them to bits and takes them back to his place to hang out ( literally ) . Of course , sooner or later , someone has to escape this dude and give this a sort of happy ending , except for the hint at the end that all could NOT be well . . . . . it's kind of late for a sequel to this , though , isn't it ? Ha , in the movie industry ? Yeah right . One note though : The box on my Vestron VHS tape says it's 88 minutes , the box on Code Red says : approx . 83 minutes . . . . ? ? ! ! I don't know if there's anything missing or not , or if someone just can't count , but the DVD sure looks good . , hey , it's not for everyone .
503873	2911571	69840	8.0	Good little film with some great twists ( maybe a minor spoiler or 2 )	Candy is 16 and on her way home from school when 3 people in a van sweep her off her feet and put her in a hole in the ground . With oxygen , of course . Seems like Candy has been targeted as " most likely to yield diamonds " to the 3 kidnappers , who have been staking her out and her father , who works at a jewelry store specializing in diamonds . There's only one problem though : Her father is only her stepfather , and if Candy was to die before her 21st birthday he gets of her trust fund , which is why he's married her mother in the first place . . . and he's been VERY patient , waiting for SOMETHING to happen . So now , the kidnappers have Candy and nothing else , and they certainly aren't of a mind to help dear old dad out in achieving his goal . There is also a small autistic boy ( who can't speak ) who has witnessed the burial of Candy , and he attempts to bring this matter to light with his parents , but they're too caught up in their own screwed-up lives to pay much heed to what he's trying to bring to their attention . The scenes with this child are amazing , for as young as he is , he does quite well in his role . As the situation with Candy and what to do with her worsens , the kidnappers begin to turn on each other because one wants to make sure Candy is OK and the others just want to kill her since she's no longer of any use . Considering that this is a low budget drive-in movie , it's actually well done and the acting is decent , especially Ben Piazza as the cold-as-ice stepfather . The ending is quite grim though , and leaves one thing unresolved but there's pretty much only one thing that could have happened . I found this to be pretty interesting and and well done for a low-budget movie and I thought it was well worth seeing . , check it out if you like 70's exploitation flicks .
504118	2911571	346800	8.0	always expect the unexpected with Maddin	This is autobiographical ? Not in a million years , or at least I hope not . I don't know much about Guy Maddin's personal life but I'm at least relatively sure he wasn't a murderous hairdressing hockey player with blue hands . Maddin's films are always full of surprises , and this is by far his most , uh , daring , as far as the subject matter presented . As per his usual formula , if he could be said to have one , it's filmed like it's a 1920's film with modern themes , and this takes his modern themes a bit further than any of his previous films . After a rousing hockey game with the Maroons , after which Maddin suffers from a couple head shots , he and his best friend Shaky ( who is also the police chief ? ) take his girlfriend Veronica to a beauty salon which , at night , is turned into a brothel / abortion clinic . There , the hockey teams beloved Dr . Fusi performs a procedure on Veronica after which she dies while Maddin runs off with the brothel madam's daughter , Meta . Meta wants her father's hands ( which are blue from hair dye ) transplanted on Guy , but the doctor disposes of those hands and merely paints Guy's hands blue , after which he goes on a murderous rampage because he can't control his ' new hands ' . There's a hockey player's wax museum , a sub-plot involving revenge killing , and other delightful stuff going on too . There's also a lot of male full-frontal nudity , yeow , where did THAT come from ? At any rate this is pretty damn strange but it is worthwhile to see and Maddin's genius , if that's what it is , has triumphed again . For fans of jaw-dropping weirdness . . . but perhaps not a good place to start for the uninitiated . And IS there a good place to start for those not familiar with Maddin's weird world ? Try " The Saddest Music in the World " , his most , uh , accessible film , if you like that try some of his other stuff . , wow . . . .
505368	2911571	55783	8.0	eerie thriller from India	This is a highly atmospheric film & while rather tame by modern standards , it still manages to be quite creepy at times . A man ( Kumar ) returns to his ancestral home to find it seems to be haunted . There's a creepy butler called Laxman who is very reminiscent of old dark house films , almost like Boris Karloff . There's also a beautiful young lady ( Radha ) who herds goats and lives nearby with her uncle . It seems that every night at 9 : 30 something odd happens , and it has to do with murders in the past , and are there really ghosts or are there people merely creeping around doing nefarious things ? There's also a plump detective to add comic relief , and a guy named Mohan who gets around on crutches who may not be who he seems at all . Lots of the scenes take place in tall grass and that adds to the creepiness . This is beautifully photographed in crisp black and white , although due to the age of the film ( and possibly poor storage ) the film has obviously been damaged somewhat and there are blips here & there on the DVD , but that doesn't detract from the viewing experience too much . Quite reminiscent of creepy US films of the 30's & 40's at times , this still stands rather well on its own . .
504450	2911571	67500	8.0	dark and creepy stuff	This is the first of the Blind Dead series , I just sprung for the box set from Blue Underground and while I'd seen this on VHS a long time ago I rather enjoyed seeing it again . If " enjoyed " is the right word , because it's dark , creepy , and dare I say it ? Sure , why not , disturbing . An old medieval town exists in the middle of nowhere near the Spanish and Portuguese border , and when one woman of a trio that is headed for a weekend in the country decides to disembark from a moving train she hikes through the countryside and finds this place . Deciding it's a nice spot to bed down for the night ( ! ! ) she proceeds to cuddle up in her sleeping bag only to get munched by skeletal knights in rotting shrouds . These knights were of an order that practiced the dark arts , and I guess technically they're the Templars of legend but that's never mentioned in the movie . However , as wandering dead things , you can't get much creepier . The scenes with them on horseback are something to see as well . This is a very atmospheric film and it does well at conveying a sense of dread . This is early 70's Euro-horror at about its finest , in my book . .
505063	2911571	425661	8.0	Entertaining and wild " children's film " that is probably not for children	" Yokai Daisenso " is a children's film by Takashi Miike , but as you might expect , it's probably a bit too dark & scary for younger ones . However , older children may well eat this up , that is , if you play it dubbed in English . The story is that of a young boy , who has moved with his mother to the country , to live with his grandfather , after a divorce . During a village festival the boy is chosen as a " Kirin rider " , a great honor , but with that honor comes much danger and adventure , of course . Meanwhile , evil doings are at hand as a woman in a white mini skirt , go-go boots & a beehive hair-do , teams up with an evil Yokai to turn people's resentments and discarded items against them . And this evil has manifested itself as a flying city in the form of a monster that heads for the City of Rage itself , Tokyo . One quite funny scene has two derelicts watching the monster fly over the city . . . says one , " Oh , it's only Gamera " . The young boy has befriended Yokai , which are monsters of a kind , mostly benign , that have isolated themselves away from humans , and all the Yokai in Japan band together to fight the evil . In many ways Miike & crew have taken the late 60's / early 70's Yokai films and turned them into a modern action adventure film for ( older ) kids that also combines some strange mechanical monsters that made me think of " Transformers " . The look and feel of the film is great , the effects are entertaining , and some of the humor will just sail right over kid's heads , but still , older ones might enjoy it . As for adults , there's not much here not to like , if you're a fan of Japanese monster movies you'll enjoy the heck out of this . Cool & fun stuff , kind of dark at times but perhaps that's just Miike . . and what a wild ride . .
504468	2911571	131534	8.0	Weird , twisted , worthy of your time . . . . if you enjoy dark humor	I'm not sure why so many people seem to dislike this film , at least ones that have reviewed it on IMDb . I have now seen this twice and found it to be just as weird and hilarious the second time as the first . Beth is a lonely young lady at a Kansas high school that makes two new friends , one of whom is Student Body president , and the other is his girlfriend , and on the school newspaper . Now Beth has a somewhat troubled home life , as her parents are whacko , so she's often tardy for school , for which she gets called to the principal's office . His intention is to make a pass at her but it's unsuccessful when she brains him with a trophy , and she then enlists the help of her new friends to help her dispose of the evidence . . . . oh yes , the principal is still alive , for now , anyway . He's taken to the basement of this one girl's house and held captive . Unfortunately for our heroic trio , this was all witnessed by Terra , an " absurd " girl with outrageous clothing and hairstyle ( think one of the B-52's wearing 70's polyester , for want of a better description ) and Cherry , the angry rich girl with psychotic tendencies , to say the least . Of course the principal is accidentally loosed from his bonds and then shot , also accidentally , sort of . So now there's a body to dispose of but Cherry seems to know a lot about that , so her help is enlisted . As a subplot there were several girls chosen as prom queen nominees , and Cherry , who isn't nominated , of course wants to be prom queen , so she's busily mowing down the candidates in her Jeep Cherokee and even picks off a few in a drive-by . This is a busy movie . Now , this is very well done considering it's a low budget film with no-name actors and actresses , and the film makers had a pretty good sense of humor and it comes off quite well . Mind you , the humor is mostly jet-black and this ain't no run-of-the-mill mindless teen comedy . Makes Kansas seem like quite a scary place , too . I give this , if you like black comedies that take good taste for a drag through the mud , you'll most likely enjoy this . If you're looking for a dumb teen comedy , look elsewhere .
505074	2911571	277909	8.0	Hilarious animated sci-fi revenge flick	I've been a fan of Plympton's ever since I saw his early stuff in the 80's , probably at a " Spike & Mikes " festival . I enjoyed " I Married a Strange Person " , and now this , Mutant Aliens . Mutant Aliens isn't quite as funny or outrageous as " I Married . . . " but it still manages to be vile , disgusting , gory and hilarious , sometimes all at the same time . It even has a rather decent story which is ( to me anyway ) , far more coherent that " I Married . . . " . Astronaut Earl Jensen is launched into space & the evil Dr . Frubar rigs it so his spacecraft loses all its fuel , and then blames it all on Earl's young daughter Josie . Dr . Frubar has staged all this to get people to contribute to the space program , of course , so accidents like this don't happen again . Fast forward to the future , when Josie is all grown up and working at an observatory , when she spots an object entering Earth's atmosphere & it turns out to be dear old dad , returned to earth with some benign aliens . . . . for revenge . And , surprise , the aliens aren't so benign after all , but they are pretty darn cute for the ravenous creatures they're supposed to be , especially the tiny chipmunk-like creature with the big eyes , which strikes fear into the hearts of all who gaze upon it . I rather enjoyed this whole film , and Plympton's animation just kind of sucks me right in . . . yeah , it's a bit primitive but I still like it a lot . If you're a Plympton fan , you should like it , if not , well , perhaps this isn't the best place to start , perhaps his earlier work first . . ? , fun stuff . . .
504541	2911571	71143	8.0	somewhat contrived in parts but still fun and interesting	I guess you could say this wasn't really a true documentary , as there are parts of it that are staged , and if you're making a film you can get pretty much the outcome you want with editing , etc . But that doesn't detract from the enjoyment of the film , if you don't think about some of what you're seeing too hard while you're watching this . Jamie Uys chose to film the denizens of the Namib desert ( both the " red " and the " white " ) , and there are some truly fascinating creatures that live in both , and have adapted themselves to their environment . Granted , this was made over 30 years ago so things may have changed a bit since then too . There's lots of " choreographed " animal activity with classical music playing and that all works quite well . It is a bit disturbing though to see baby pelicans stranded when the water in which they thrive dries up rapidly and they begin a " death march " in which only a few survive . There's even some plant life examined and while some of what's shown is obviously animated , it's still somewhat interesting . Uys also touches briefly on Bushmen , apparently one of his favorite subjects and a tiny bit of a preview of what was to come , since some of the same oddities are shown here that were shown in " The Gods Must Be Crazy " , several years later . Overall , this makes a pretty good " family film " but it's also rather interesting for people that just enjoy animals . .
503913	2911571	75462	8.0	DVD release of " Who Could Kill A Child ? "	This is a film that I'd been waiting to see for a very long time , and it's finally been released on DVD from Dark Sky Films . The DVD itself is very nice & the print is clean and clear . The story concerns a young couple who are on holiday in a coastal town ( Spain ? ) and are going to a remote island for the balance of their relaxation time . They rent a boat to reach this island , and upon arriving are greeted by several children at the dock who help them to secure their boat & then go back to their play . As the young couple go in search of refreshment and then their hotel , they note the lack of any other people in the village , anyone of adult age , that is . The husband leaves his wife in a bar to go find something to eat & the wife is visited by a young girl , Lourdes , who is rather interested that the wife is pregnant and wants to touch her belly , but then flees when the husband returns . The husband , of course , has encountered no one in his travels , but he doesn't have the camera eye view that the audience at home has . And one is beginning to suspect that things are very wrong here . After eating the couple heads for their hotel & they spot an old man , who is then beaten by a young girl with a big stick , so the husband gets his wife out of the way and moves the man's body so as not to upset her , I guess , and then lies about what happened to assure her . . . he must really want this vacation ! Although , he does begin to have his doubts shortly after when he sees a band of children have strung up the man's body and are playing " pinata " with it , but using a scythe instead of a stick . . . thankfully we're spared the bursting . The couple then decides it's time to get out of Dodge , but it's rather late by then . They do find another adult who has been hiding and he's an ally for a while , but his own daughter lures him into coming home because his wife and mother are sick , supposedly . The conflict in this movie is when it comes to actually killing any of these children because adults just don't do that , although there's plenty of footage at the beginning of the film that shows children suffering in all kinds of horrific conditions from WW2 right up to ( at that time ) the present . Of course , children do get killed but by then it was far to late to be thinking about all that anyway . This is a fairly chilling film because it creates a sense of dread out of virtually nothing , much in the way that Peter Weir does in " Last Wave " or " Picnic at Hanging Rock " and what seems rather ordinary turns out to be one's worst nightmare . A decent 70's chiller and a different kind of horror . . . . far better than things like " Children of the Corn " , which has a similar premise but is not even remotely in the same league . .
504784	2911571	56112	8.0	good old-fashioned fairy tale with scary scenes for kids	Seems there's a lot of films that scared people as kids , and this seems to be one that people that grew up in the UK remember well . I personally had never seen it until yesterday , and while it's pretty mild for an adult , I can certainly see where it would scare the bejeezus out of the kids . Personally , Wizard of Oz used to scare the crap out of me & I couldn't get past the scene with the witch on top of the house and when the flying monkeys showed up , that was all I could watch for years . At any rate , this is a good old-fashioned sort of fairy tale , complete with an evil prince and a giant who kidnaps a princess in order to negotiate with her father , the king , as to when this evil prince might take the throne . Of course , our hero , Kerwin Mathews , saves the princess from the giant but of course the evil Pendgragon is persistent . The stop motion animation is pretty good , and some of the effects , especially the witches that attack the ship and make off with the princess , yet again . These are some of the scenes a friend in the UK described to me as scary when he was a kid and I can certainly see why . It's also pretty obvious , I think , that Rob Reiner used this as part of his " inspiration " for the Princess Bride , although that's played more for comedy than adventure and swashbuckling . Familiar character actor Walter Burke makes a good evil henchman to Pendragon , as well . Overall this is an enjoyable diversion for a Saturday afternoon for kids of all ages , but perhaps the younger ones will be too jaded for it ! .
504715	2911571	116791	8.0	Silly and messed up	This is one weird cookie of a movie , as it takes place in NYC yet everybody except a Slavic tourist ( Croat , Serb , ? ) speaks German . Most of the action takes place at Hotel Quickie , a sleazy " no tell hotel " where all manner of prostitutes of both sexes bring their Johns , and there's even a lounge where ex-cop Babette ( or Bob ) lip-syncs to Roberta Flack and The Supremes . This hotel also thoughtfully provides condoms to prevent disease but in doing so also provokes mayhem in that there's something not right about these little rubbers , they have TEETH . If you're put off by detached penises flopping around on the floor , hookers , transvestites , gay sex ( mostly implied , thankfully ) then you'd probably do well to take a pass on this . Because there's lots of all of the above . Luigi Macaroni , hard-boiled Marlowe-type detective , yet gay , is hard on the trail of the source of these nasty little rubbers , especially after one deprives him of one jewel . The condoms themselves are cute and rather squeaky , that is , until you see their teeth . The condoms were supposed to have been designed by H . R . Giger , he who did the critter in Alien , so you probably know what to expect there . Especially notable is the giant condom that you see towards the end when Macaroni stumbles across the source of these nasty little critters . OK , so if you're still with me , keep in mind that this is a Troma release , and therefore not for everyone . If you're a Troma and Troma pick-up fan though , you'll most likely enjoy this , that is if you can get past the some of the themes . , good disgusting fun .
504097	2911571	209485	8.0	strange & chilling	Lily is a young lady about 14 who isn't well . And speaking of not well , there's her parents . Now dad has left to go somewhere , leaving mom in charge of the bed & breakfast that they run . Along comes a young man , a photographer , who thought that it would be nicer to stay at a bed & breakfast than a roadside motel . That turns out to be only in theory . Things seem OK at first until mom starts displaying tendencies towards odd behavior , and that's when the mystery of Lily begins . The young man finds her diary , and it seems like mom & dad aren't very nice to her or her uncle / friend , whomever this guy may be , named Tom . . . . now Tom , on the other hand , is VERY nice to Lily and isn't around anymore to talk about it . This is creepy and somewhat atmospheric , and chilling , because most of it is in a snowbound landscape in the middle of nowhere , something that you'd expect of Canada although at one point a license plate is shown and it's New Hampshire ( Live Free or Die ) . That in itself seems to be a bit of a statement of some kind . I will admit this is a bit slow moving at times , and in no way is there any explosions or car chases and things like that , but try to stick with it , it's chillingly creepy and weird and you may find you just like it . .
504179	2911571	79482	8.0	Eerie Australian flick	Long Weekend is sort of like " Day of the Animals " as done by Peter Weir ( think " Last Wave " and " Picnic At Hanging Rock " . But this is NOT a Peter Weir film , just so you understand that . A young couple heads to a seaside campsite to sort things out as their marriage isn't doing so well , and they're a couple of non-nature types , trees are there to be chopped down for no reason , critters to be run over or shot or sprayed with insecticide , etc . And there's other strange things going on like things in the water ( but not a shark ) and eerie sounds at night , and there appeared to be other folks camped down the beach but while their stuff is still there where did they go ? It seems like animals are turning against people and while these two are not the only ones , they are the focus of this film . Like the films of Peter Weir , this has an atmosphere of anxiety and anticipation instead of cheap scares , and creates discomfort from practically nothing . This is well done and well worth seeing , highly recommended . .
504503	2911571	66849	8.0	An inescapable feeling of dread throughout . . . . .	This was one of my favorite films when I was younger & it was on the late-night " Creature Features " circuit . I've just gotten this on DVD and I have found that it is still a fairly powerful film , to me . A young man , Ralph , uncovers the remains of something while plowing a field , and he's frightened by what he's found , so he goes to a judge who is staying nearby to tell of his findings , only to come back & have whatever it was , gone . So of course , no one believes him , but he comes back with friends , one of whom is Angel , who DOES find something but won't show anyone . And the son of the woman where the judge is staying , returns home with a new bride to be , but after she's forced to stay the night in the attic room , she goes mad because something was up there with her . And she's taken away to Bedlam . Now , the children of this village are acting more & more strangely , and beginning to disappear . Seems that Angel has something to do with this , and so does what she found in the fields . There apparently are some sort of deep-woods rituals going on to mutilate the village's children for some kind of chilling resurrection . And there is something that is causing pains in the children , and at the location of those pains , they've grown a hairy patch of " The Devil's Skin " , as the doctor says when he's trying to remove it from one young woman . This is beautifully filmed , and the children are somewhat innocent enough , but you know that they're not quite themselves and are up to no good , and there is an inescapable feeling of dread throughout this whole film . When things begin to get really out of hand , one man rides to find the judge ( Patrick Wymark ) who returns and puts things right again . Strange he didn't do that in the first place instead of returning to London , but then , he didn't at first believe what was happening , either . An excellent early 70's British horror flick , very atmospheric and creepy and well worth seeing , and gee , it's not even a Hammer production . .
504730	2911571	385752	8.0	just keep repeating to yourself . . . . it's only a movie , it's only a movie . . . .	I received an email ( one of those internet things that goes around from person to person ) telling me this movie should be boycotted because of the values & morals it would instill in young people . So , of course , I went to see it with a friend & his son ( 4 years old ) and I thoroughly enjoyed it . I also saw nothing in it that I would take to be bad for children ( or adults ) and kept in mind that it was only a movie & couldn't hurt me . Then again , I'm not a paranoid alarmist . Golden Compass has marvelous special effects and stunning visuals , and is beautiful to watch . As for the story , well , I haven't read any of the books ( and didn't know they existed until " controversy " reared its ugly head ) so I can't really comment on how well this did or didn't adhere to the original stories , but I found it thoroughly enjoyable , if a bit confusing at times . The " daemons " that everyone seems to have by their sides are wondrous little creatures , protectors & perhaps " soul mates " and the one that Lyra has , Pan , morphs from bird to ferret to cat to mouse , and is my favorite of them all . The story seems to be that young children are being kidnapped and taken to the North , where they're experimented on and apparently separated from their " daemons " . Lyra has gone to free them & enlists the help of an armored polar bear & a cowboy sort of guy ( Sam Elliot ) and his sidekick , a jackrabbit " daemon " . There are some scenes that may be a bit scary for small children , like the ice bear fight scene and the scene with the " cossack-like " warriors and their wolf " daemons " . Overall though , this is a fantastic magical adventure and if you just enjoy it and try not to read things into that aren't there , you'll probably like it just fine . .
504709	2911571	94793	8.0	Silly and nasty and from Frank Henenlotter , so what do you expect ?	If you're not familiar with Basket Case or Frankenhooker , there's a good chance you shouldn't start out with " Brain Damage " if you are curious about the films of Frank Henenlotter . I'd suggest that if you haven't already seen any of his films start out with Basket Case and THEN if you're still willing check out Brain Damage . Seems there's this young man Brian , who wakes up to discover that he's got a little friend , who's name is Aylmer ( Elmer ) . Now Aylmer isn't too pretty to look at , he looks like a cross between a deformed penis , a turd , and perhaps one of those critters from Cronenberg's " Shivers " . And he talks , and he injects fluid into Brian's brain that makes him see colors and such , AND he also eats brains . Sucks ' em right out , he does . Problem is that Aylmer is like a drug , and a highly addictive one at that . Also problematic is that Aylmer used to reside with an old couple in the same building who fed him animal brains to keep him weak , and they , also being addicted , want him back . Of course with all these injections of juice , Brian hasn't been feeling himself these days , and his behavior becomes strange and erratic . It's funny to see Kevin Van Hentrick ( Basket Case ) on a subway car with Brian & his girlfriend , complete with his basket ( and Belial inside ? ) and to see him move away from them because THEY'RE too weird . I guess you could call this a horror comedy , because it is a bit silly at times , but it's also kind of nasty with plenty of blood and gore . Probably not for the uninitiated but I give it an .
504566	2911571	75666	8.0	messy & nasty	Another " forgotten gem " from Moctezuma , one in which two young ladies that live at a convent are possessed and cause a bit of havoc , to say the least . Justine comes to live at the convent & is befriended by Alucarda , and as they're romping through the countryside around the convent they encounter a strange gypsy man that speaks terrible German and may be other than he appears ( and his appearance isn't any too normal ) . The two girls begin exhibiting strange behavior and then spouting blasphemy so they're under the care of a doctor and a priest , and an exorcism is called for but apparently Justine doesn't survive that . . . or does she ? Who knows , because she mysteriously disappears . Lots of blood , lots of screaming and torture , and lots of nuns doing uncharacteristic things , like menstruating in their habits and bursting into flames ? Charming . At any rate , this isn't a bad little flick , takes a bit to get going but when it does it gets pretty darn nasty and messy . A bit more over the top than Mansion of Madness , just a bit . .
505000	2911571	59311	8.0	Esperanto ?	OK , let's first scare away all the non-adventurous types by saying this film is in Esperanto with Subtitles , and it's from 1965 and in black & white . It does have Captain Kirk in it but he's too busy trying to master Esperanto to emote very much , I guess . OK , having said that , this was quite a nice surprise , because after all I've heard & read about this I wasn't expecting it to live up to the ' hype ' but I guess it does . The atmosphere of this is always eerie and creepy , the basic story line is a struggle between good and evil , as two evil sisters , one of which gets her kicks from luring men into the sea and drowning them , set their sites on Marc ( Shatner ) . He's squeaky clean with a heart of gold and " defiles " one sister with his goodness , therefore the evil Incubus is summoned forth . Sounds weird , eh ? Well , it is . But it's also pretty much a pleasant surprise to fans of horror , even though it's pretty tame . In watching it I didn't realize that Leslie Stevens had a big part in the making of this , and I heard recycled music from the old Outer Limits TV series that had me wondering until I saw the credits . And this does have the feeling of some of the Outer Limits episodes , just kicked up a few notches on the Strange-O-Meter . And Esperanto ? It's an " artificial " language , at one time it was thought to be destined to be a " universal " language , thankfully THAT didn't happen , but it lends an extra dash of weirdness to an already weird movie . See it , it's great , you'll be glad you did , if you have a sense of adventure .
504452	2911571	75913	8.0	stick with the TV master version	OK , so this was one of my favorite 70's TV movies that I saw way back when and guess what ? I still like it , and when I first saw it I had no inkling who William Girdler was . . . . what , you don't know either ? Well , OK . . anyway , this just came out on DVD from the folks at Shriek Show , whose DVD's are pretty hit or miss in the quality department This has both the TV version & the theatrical version , forget the theatrical version , it's warts and all and missing chunks , I'm not even sure why it was included . And if you're not familiar with the story here , there's a bunch of folks hiking in the mountains & the ozone layer's gone because of too much fluorocarbons and all the wild animals go , well , wild , I guess you could say , like attacking humans and stuff ? This is actually pretty high quality for " made for TV " , and while it's still a cheesy 70's movie it's actually pretty darn good . .
505142	2911571	457430	8.0	Awesome adult " fairy tale "	Pan's Labyrinth brings to mind Guillermo Del Toro's other Spanish Civil War film , Devi'ls Backbone , because it's a film mostly from a child's point of view and it also incorporates the supernatural , or in this instance , it's more a young girl's obsession with fantasy , to deal with life during war . The young girl and her pregnant mother are going to live with a Captain in the Spanish army , the father of the woman's unborn child , and the daughter does not want to recognize this man as her father , much less go live with him . She has far better instincts than her mother , for this man is sadistic , narcissistic , and his main concern is that he have a son to carry on his name . The young girl is either having dreams , supernatural experiences , or has retreated into a fantasy world where she thinks a she has met a faun in an old labyrinth on the property and has been recognized as a princess and is to carry out three tasks to prove her worthiness . Meanwhile , back at the ranch , Mercedes , the servant , is smuggling out food and medicine to nearby rebels , one of whom is her brother . And Mercedes hates the captain and feels sorry for the young girl and her mother . This is a rather awesome film to watch and the idea of fantasy type creatures out and about during a wartime setting is rather fascinating . One scene has the little girl drawing a door in her room with a piece of chalk and descending into the world of whatever the thing is that's in all the promo's , a creature with its eyes in the palm of it's hands , which is probably the scariest thing in this film , besides the captain , that is . I was shocked to see , here , in Louisville , KY , a FULL THEATER of people when this film ended and everyone started to leave . For this movie is in Spanish with subtitles . I guess not everyone thinks that if it's not in English it doesn't belong here . A movie well worth seeing , .
505046	2911571	59043	8.0	Stalkers have been around for a long time , I guess . . . . . .	Even in proper Great Britain in the 60's , there were stalkers , and this one , mild-mannered young Freddie , collects himself a lovely specimen ( much in the same way he does butterflies ) in Samantha Eggar , whom he places in a lovingly constructed dungeon in his lonely country house he bought after winning a huge football pool . Terrence Stamp is great as the shy & repressed but vaguely threatening Freddie , always the gentleman , despite the fact he's got this poor woman locked away and she doesn't want to be there . The idea is that he will keep her until she doesn't want to leave , but she's not exactly going for that . This is a decent little thriller , all in all tame by today's standards , but still very worthwhile if you like older films & for the most part , quite well done . Interesting to see Eggar in this role , as all I've ever seen her in is 70's & 80's horror films , and you might say she was past her prime by then . All in all , stars , a decent watch .
504536	2911571	17739	9.0	excellent silent " spook house " film	I had seen the 1979 version of The Cat and the Canary a few years ago , & didn't find it particularly good or memorable . Now that I watched the original , I found that to be far more entertaining & an excellent " spook house " film . The story is that of an old mansion , built on a hill above the Hudson River ( which makes it in New York somewhere by my calculations ) . 20 years after the owner , who was considered insane , died , some distant relatives of his are to be gathered for the reading of his will . Guests are greeted by the dour Mammy Pleasant , who has taken care of the house ( but not the cobwebs , apparently ) for the 20 years since her master's death . The relatives gather , one is named the sole heir BUT she must be pronounced sane by a doctor who doesn't look like the bedrock of mental health himself . To add to the fun , there's apparently also an escaped lunatic loose , either on the grounds or IN THE HOUSE . . . . eek ! This is a fun and totally enjoyable horror / comedy type flick . The old house is perfect , full of secret passages and spooky settings . The cast is great & plays their roles to the hilt . Of course , everything is a bit exaggerated in silent films to get the point across , but that's just part of the fun . An excellent film for a dark & stormy night , or just about any time , really . .
504980	2911571	382806	9.0	excellent , off-beat Aussie film about life & death	Nick has just found out that he has testicular cancer , and he's devastated . Meryl has a brief chance meeting with Nick on her way home from visiting her parents , and just before she witnesses a man run down by a train who was apparently trying to save his dog . Meryl is an artist who sees death everywhere in her imagination , and witnessing the man hit by the train doesn't help . Eventually she and Nick develop a tentative relationship but she is confused by his reluctance until he tells her he has cancer . We are shown all aspects of the tragedy of the man run down by the train , from his girlfriend's grief to the train driver's remorse , and yet eventually everything works its way around to a more-or-less upbeat ending . This is an excellent off-beat film , and our brief trips into Meryl's imagination ( all animated ) was something that I could identify with , somewhat . The film's message seems to be why dwell on death when life is there to be enjoyed , and while my take on this is a bit simplistic , it's a worthwhile message and a great film . See it now . .
505271	2911571	55830	9.0	No frills classic horror , probably the best ever . . . .	This is probably the best ever low budget horror film ever made , back in the dark days of 1962 . It has an eerie quality that's hard to explain to anyone that hasn't seen it . A young woman is the sole survivor of a car that went off a bridge into a river , but no one seems to understand how she survived . She goes off to Utah to play the organ at a church ( which is just a job to her ) and is haunted by a white-faced specter that no one else can see . Some of this is filmed at an old pavilion out by a lake which is creepy in itself . As the movie progresses Mary Henry ( Candace Hilligoss ) experiences strange periods where she seems to have trouble interacting with others . Being a person that doesn't care for human company anyway , she is still disturbed by these incidents . An excellent twist ending at the pavilion is probably one of the most surreal & finest pieces of film making I've seen . And now a slight commentary : I bought this on a slim-pack DVD from a big discount chain store for $1 . 00 . A seller of " important films " markets this for about $39 . My cheap DVD plays just fine and how much better can this film be ? Anyway , off the soapbox , this movie rates in my book , if you have't seen it , where have you been ?
505130	2911571	66563	9.0	for 1970 , this kicks butt	I have no idea how this film was received upon release but it's a dark dark comedy , with plenty of bad words and plenty of controversial subjects , in other words , it's pretty offensive , and I loved it . George Segal stars as a lawyer with a senile mother ( Ruth Gordon ) who has apparently managed to scare away all nurses and housekeepers in NYC . The latest attempt at a care-giver is a young lady ( Trish Van Devere ) who Segal fell in love with at first sight but momma keeps getting in the way . This is full of unexpected jaw-dropping lines and situations and is basically a rollicking romp through the depths of bad taste . Ruth Gordon is excellent as always as the senile mother who is always wondering where Poppa is ( he's been dead for years ) . Now THIS is a comedy , perhaps more along the lines of a John Waters comedy but still probably a big chance in Hollywood 36 years ago . Check it out , well worth seeing . .
504263	2911571	40522	9.0	desperation & hope	In post-WW2 Italy , a man gets a job ( which are scarce ) and to do his job , he needs a bicycle , which he has pawned , so his wife sells their sheets to get the money to get the bicycle out of hock . With the new job , the man is thinking of how much money he will make and how much better his family will live , until when he's working , his bicycle is stolen . He desperately tries to get it back , but it's gone , and a group of friends and he try to look for it , but to no avail . He and his son comb all of the city looking for it , and out of sheer desperation he actually tries to steal someone else's bicycle but is caught . Because of the presence of his son , he is forgiven and doesn't go to jail , but he's back to square one with no resolution . This is a rather depressing film , or perhaps merely sad , because the state of things in Italy after the war are not good and people are trying whatever they can to survive . The hero , Ricci , is a good man , trying to do what's best for his family and yet he's tempted to do what he knows is wrong when there seems to be no other solution . This is a great film , with great acting , and well worth seeing for anyone that wants to see what desperation leads people to do . Recommended . .
504671	2911571	460829	9.0	dense , claustrophobic , disturbing , difficult to follow , and great !	I'm kind of disappointed that Inland Empire may have only had a very short theatrical run in the US , because I would have loved to have seen it at the cinema . However , since I live out in the " boondocks " , I had to make do with the DVD which I've been waiting for anxiously . I can't say I was at all disappointed by the film but I would need to watch it again to see if I can get some kind of idea what the hell it's about . Laura Dern plays an actress that gets a part in a movie , and she's attracted to her co-star ( Justin Theroux ) , but beyond that , this is mostly a surreal nightmare . Is Dern lost in an alternate universe of sorts , or is she losing her mind ? We have a family of rabbits ( to be precise , humans with rabbit heads ) in a small apartment , talking nonsense and waiting for SOMETHING to happen , and apparently this is a sitcom too , since there's a laugh-track to it . We have bits and pieces of people speaking in Polish ( with English subtitles ) and what all this has to do with the rest of the film was beyond me . And , we have Dern wandering back into the dark at the back of a movie studio and coming out somewhere else , to a small house furnished in early post-modern Lynch . We also have her hanging out with what seems to be a group of prostitutes , who " do the locomotion " to Little Eva and then disappear . We have a young woman who is seemingly watching all that is happening on her TV screen too , and she seems to be the key to some of this . Laura Dern plays her part to the hilt , and she goes through a very wide range of changes from wholesome , clean actress to abused housewife to crazed street person or hooker , I wasn't sure which . Throughout all she manages to look quite haunted , and that's pretty much how I felt while watching this . I'm a big Lynch fan , not to the point that I subscribe to his website or anything , but I do love his movies & Twin Peaks . This may be one of his best films but I can't say without watching it at least once more . On an interesting side note , there is something inside the DVD that advertises David Lynch's label of coffee . . . thanks , but I'll pass , who knows what might be in it . .
505600	2911571	59025	9.0	Interestingly weird little time capsule	I found this DVD for five bucks yesterday at a used movie & music store and it jumped into my hand , claiming to be something that I wanted , so I took it home with me , and wow , it's great and I wasn't disappointed at all . This is the semi-autobiographical story of the director himself , an alcoholic & drug addict that goes to somewhere in France for treatment . Beyond that tidbit of " normalcy " well , I'm at a loss to describe most of the rest of it although hallucinations and DT's could explain it , or maybe spiritual experiences ? We're treated to the music of Ravi Shankar & The Fugs and who knows who else , and some of it's quite good in a 60's non-pop way . This is surreal and bizarre and actually has quite a bit of humor to it but one also feels some sympathy for the lead character Russell ( as played by Rooks ) as he's self-destructing . And imagine showing up at a place to be treated for drug abuse and finding that William S . Burroughs one of your attending physicians ? Talk about a bad trip . At any rate , I was all of 8 years old when this was made but I truly enjoyed watching it and anyone with a taste for the weird and different should check this out , although apparently it's now out of print and hard to find . I guess things only work that way if you're actually LOOKING for it though . stars , well worth seeing !
504764	2911571	67633	9.0	highly disturbing and as relevant today as when it was made	Punishment Park is a pseudo-documentary made by Peter Watkins . The premise is that the nation's dissidents ( hippies , musicians , protesters , pacifists , etc . ) are being rounded up and tried by a tribunal and then given the choice of prison or running the course of Punishment Park . It's a 52 mile grueling trek through the desert to an American flag , with police , National Guard , and various other authority figures in pursuit . The idea is , that if you make it to the flag , you're set free . The tribunal consists of a bunch of conservative types , all condemning any behavior that is not like their own , and there is no result except a prison sentence or the option of " Punishment Park " for any of those on trial . There are a lot of things in this that still ring true today , which is quite disturbing in itself . The people running the course are promised water at the half-way point , which isn't true , and the pursuing officials are mostly a sadistic bunch that are just out for a bit of target practice . This is not a very graphic film but it's more shocking in its ideas and themes than anything else . The scary thing is , it could happen . Not a very upbeat film but definitely worth seeing . Warning : it might make you angry . .
504558	2911571	108906	10.0	incredibly good Danish hospital horror / drama / comedy	I really loved " Riget " ( The Kingdom ) but one wonders if Von Trier doesn't owe a bit to David Lynch's " Twin Peaks " . It's not that it's a rip-off , by any means , but one wonders if The Kingdom would have come about had it not been for Lynch's pioneering ultra-weird TV show . The Kingdom is about a very strange hospital in Copenhagen , built where bleaching ponds used to be and there's been a lot of strange things that have happened there over the years . Now all those strange things seem to be coming to a head . Stig Helmar , a pompous Swedish doctor , has come to The Kingdom to work , but is universally hated except by his main squeeze , Rigmor . Hook is a strange character that lives in the basement & is sort of a " Robin Hood " of hospital supplies . Moosegard is sort of a Danish Leslie Nielsen but not as much of a buffoon . Sigard Drusse is an old woman whose son works in the hospital , and she repeatedly admits herself to study the hospital and the spirits that live there . Bondo is a doctor who is so interested in a dying man's cancerous liver he has it transplanted into himself . . . and so on . This is filmed in a rather creepy style that fits the material well . This is funny , creepy , and just plain weird most of the time and is a delight to watch . Followed by " Riget II " which continues the saga , and supposedly there was to be a " Riget III " but the main characters have now passed on so that's an impossibility . Well worth seeing , check it out ! .
