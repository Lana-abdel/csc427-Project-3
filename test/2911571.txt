505093	2911571	96177	1.0	Still born	The premise of this film is interesting , only once that premise is established then the film wanders off into the sunset long before the run time is over . The idea is that there's some lunatic running around some nameless big city killing derelicts and leaving their bodies to be found in arty settings , with the initials A . K . ( Art Killer ) showing that he's struck again . But then we wander into the not very interesting life of a young couple and a friend / neighbor of theirs who are all sort of media types ( he's a musician , she's a reporter , and their friend is a performance artist ) and from that point on the interest in the film faded by the minute . Anyone who is remotely conscious will have figured out who the culprit is long before the film is over , and my recommendation is that WHEN you figure it out you just stop either the tape or the disc , remove it from the player and throw it away . Trust me , you'll be fine , it won't really matter if you were wrong , and you won't have it on your conscience that someone ELSE will see this if you were to take it somewhere and trade it in . Believe me , you'll feel better about yourself than I did when I woke up this morning , I watched it till the end , and am still drooling . .
505068	2911571	471011	1.0	Lock the windows . Bar the doors . Draw the blinds . Don't let this one in .	There used to be a certain naivety in low-budget horror back in , oh , maybe the 70's & 80's . A film could be earnest and yet not very good , and perhaps with some unintentional entertainment value ( like laughs ) . Seems like those days are gone forever as up-and-coming " directors " can turn out seemingly " serious " horror movies , like this , at the drop of a hat , and get them released on an unsuspecting public . Be warned , this is a real piece of work . Perhaps the makers of this film WERE earnest in their efforts , but the acting is terrible and the characters are unconvincing , like the tough blond police officer and the drunken retired ex-cop that team up to catch the perpetrator in this film . The story is that young kids are getting killed in grisly ways by some Leatherface-looking killer , who may be an escaped mental patient . Suspicion falls on the janitor at the high school though , mainly because he's big & weird . He plays with dolls , & " Rock-em Sock-em Robots " with kids faces taped on . He also pretends to be a rock star & sticks pins in dolls , etc . The tough and potty-mouthed police officer then eases up and teams up on the potty-mouthed ex-cop & they set out to find the killer . The red herrings in this film are practically thrown into your lap , or perhaps your face . There are some scenes in this film that make you wonder if this was intended as a horror-comedy , but it's pretty difficult to say . The film really doesn't work on either level . Overall this is generally uninvolving and it just plays on until you either finish watching it or rip it out of the player & go to bed before it's over , like I did . Maybe the killer wasn't who it seemed to be and there was some great twist to it . Can I live without knowing this ? You betcha . .
505462	2911571	839880	1.0	I think I've reached the point where I'm not foolish enough to try to watch any more of these . . . .	I have foolishly viewed far too many of these " 8 films to die for " DVD's , from both the first go-round & the second . I think that perhaps " Lake Dead " is the nail in the coffin of my interest in these films . There were a few goodies in among the crap , like " Reincarnation " , " The Abandoned " , and " Frontiers " , but as for the rest , well , utterly forgettable with little in the way of any redeeming values . Three girls inherit a hotel from their grandfather that they didn't know was alive . Their father may well be a drunken fool , but he at least tried to protect them from the knowledge of grandpa's existence . Why ? Well , because there were some unsavory family ties that he didn't want his daughter involved in . And how unsavory were these ties ? Well , grandpa gets it at the very beginning of the film , when he decides enough is enough , apparently , although a little late , I'd say . The girls , of course , head off to view their inheritance in a big RV that belongs to an old frat buddy of one of the daughter's boyfriends . Also along for the ride is a friend of one of the daughters , of the female persuasion . There is a bit of dismay expressed by the RV owner's girlfriend , since her boyfriend has cheated on her numerous times , and he's not done yet , you can bet . When they reach the hotel they're greeted by the shriveled manager , a sweet old lady who really isn't all that sweet . And after tangling with some deformed looking locals they're picked up by the nice sheriff , who really isn't so nice . And then it's sort of revealed that the girls may have a few family ties with these folks and they're due to keep the family line going . I guess there's not a lot of good things that I can say about a movie where the highlight is a guy giving his mom some tongue . . . I won't say who it is but if anything in this movie was scary , that was it . An abysmal piece of work , not to be bothered with . .
504938	2911571	157102	1.0	OK , so I made a mistake	I know Jesse Franco is responsible for a wide variety of films , and I mainly go for his horror films , as lousy as they are at times . I guess it was morbid curiousity that drew me to this , and I wasn't even curious enough to finish it . Maybe it got better towards the end but unless you're into lesbian sex scenes ( of which there's plenty ) then you may want to take a pass . So what exactly can you say about a movie that features a woman that pees in a bowl on the kitchen counter ( while standing up ) ? Just never you mind what that's used for later , you probably don't want to know . If this sounds intriguing to you , then that's your problem but then again you might just like this movie . I myself , am no prude , I've seen plenty of disgusting movies in my day but at least they were done well , and this isn't . Sometimes too much is just too much . Bleah .
504539	2911571	129855	1.0	no-budget junk is OK to a point , then it's off to dreamland . . . .	I have no idea how this movie ended , on the DVD , that is , but at my house it ended with the push of a button and ta-dah , it was done . Some hunters and their girlfriends go out into the woods and decide to try a different trail from what they normally take , and find that they're camping near an old church and cemetery . In this cemetery seems to be a hodge-podge of people in ersatz confederate uniforms and some in flannel shirts and jeans , who rise up and attack . Of course our intrepid hunters , girlfriends in tow , manage to get away and encounter some cops , neither of whom appear to be under 60 , and one tries to explain away what happened while the other goes out into the woods and gets attacked and eaten . Whoever this guy was , he was definitely a good whimperer , not even a scream from him . The effects are rather laughable and the body that the zombies are feasting on appears to be a white shirt stuffed with nasty bits of meat so basically the things are reaching inside the shirt to get nourishment , not removing it from a disgusting gaping hole like in MOST zombie movies . There's also something about exploding bullets that make the zombies disappear in a puff of smoke , and fireworks that get thrown on a fire and then are super-imposed over the rest of the footage for that really confusing look . The one zombie feast with the policeman goes on for some time ( at least five minutes ) and there's plenty of lip-smacking and " yummy " noises which at times almost sounds rather sexual . You'll be gaping in awe . As I found myself drifting off to sleep I realized that life is too short to watch movies that are THIS bad , so I stopped it and watched something else , whew . Truly a coma-inducing film , , zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
504719	2911571	183072	2.0	yikes . . . .	There are some movies that are so horrific , so riveting , and so shocking , that there is almost a hypnotic effect on the viewer and they sit , transfixed , mouth hanging open , waiting to see what happens next . This is not one of those movies , but it does have a hypnotic effect , of sorts . More of a numbing effect , I think . Thankfully I was able to break through that effect and get up and stop this and put it somewhere where it could do no more harm . Imagine fans of Ed Wood and Don Dohler making a movie with carnivorous alien sock puppets and you about have it . Wooden acting at its finest , and when the sock puppet aliens feed , they flop down on top of something in the manner that Cathy ( from the comic strip " Cathy " ) throws herself on top of food to eat . . . the artist can't draw someone eating properly , and the special effects person here couldn't create aliens to look like they were feeding properly either so they are shown flopped on top of someone and afterward there is somewhat of a messy spot . Interesting because there are no visible mouths . We have two hapless boobs wandering the country in search of the Atlantic Ocean , but they had to stop at THIS place right when an alien invasion was taking place , one laments . Interesting that they're from out of state but have the same license plates as everyone else . And if I'm looking at license plates then you know how interesting and exciting this movie is . There is also a second film on this DVD called " Feeders Two : Slay Ride " and I'm wondering if I have the nerve to try to watch it . I'm thinking if it was done later than perhaps the actors and special effects folks had perfected their craft a bit and it'll be much better . I'm also thinking that life is too short to watch REALLY bad movies and that it should go into the trade-in pile unwatched . For those with a high threshold for pain . .
504376	2911571	54333	2.0	Horrifying	Hmm , back in 1962 , " hideous " and " blood curdling " must have meant a bit more than they do now , I guess , because the only hideous thing I found in this movie was the dubbing . A bunch of dancers on a plane , on their way to Singapore , crash land on an island that's full of big spiders ( not GIANT spiders , though , that's some other movie ) and when they bite the women's manager , he turns into a human spider monster , or something . . . . and lurks in the bushes , touching their hair and stealing their scarves with his long claws . In the words of Joe Flaherty on SCTV , oooh , scary stuff , kids . Along come two young guys that are assistants to the already - dead - when - they - found - him professor , and they help the women to get away from the island , woo hoo . For some reason the men in this seem to be holding their guts in the whole time they have their shirts off , and while what the women were doing may have been kind of racy for 1962 but now it's pretty tame & laughable . A movie that doesn't succeed as either horror or " adult " entertainment . Truly a bore .
505008	2911571	278408	4.0	Dead Teen Horror , Hong Kong Style	Interesting to note that Dead Teen Horror movies can be just as bad from Hong Kong as they are right here in the good old USA . This is kind of a Freddy and Jason rolled into one ( instead of versus ) and when a bunch of teens go to a lonely island to have a camp out , they run afoul of the weirdos that live there and pay with their lives . Nothing you haven't seen before , if you want that , check out Japanese movies . The subtitles on this one are pretty literal , meaning they aren't conversational English and apparently not done by someone for whom English is their main language . Cantonese ( or Mandarin , I don't know which one I heard this in ) is a lot harder on the ears than Japanese , in fact it grates on your nerves , or at least it did mine . This is pretty much by-the-numbers stuff , just from a different country , which a lot of times guarantees it's going to be better but I guess in the future I'll just stick to the " new wave " of Japanese horror , which is far more imaginative and not just copying Western ways . , see it if you must but be prepared to be disappointed .
504434	2911571	293346	4.0	them darn goat-suckers . . .	I vowed some time ago to never get another Joe Castro film ( perhaps after " Near Death " ) but I sort of ended up with this one by accident , since it was a Troma release & I didn't read the cover carefully . Oops . Well , I watched it , and it's by no means good , but it's , I guess , sort of " tongue in cheek " . . . . if it's not , it sure seemed that way . Some intrepid folks from the University of the Rio Grande set out to find if the Chupacabra exists , because of surveillance camera footage from someone's GOAT BARN that shows this weird thing hopping across the field of vision . And also because the person that this thing supposedly killed was the uncle of the leader of the expedition . There's a couple of camera men , one of whom whines the whole time , and there some ex-Marine named " Army " ( ? ! ) , who is some kind of munitions expert or something . At any rate , the do find the Chupacabra on some guy's ranch & set out to find it , getting involved with two supposed witches along the way . The creature itself is rather ridiculous-looking , with spines on its back & a great big long tongue that Gene Simmons would die for . Eventually , after a bunch of folks done get killed , so does the Chupacabra , and they take it back to the university for an autopsy . So , is it from another planet ? Is it a genetic creation from some lab in Puerto Rico ? Uh , they don't tell us , really . Not exactly intriguing but not quite terrible either . Definitely not a wide audience for this one . .
504970	2911571	86119	4.0	now on DVD as " Island Fury " . . . . and what the hell IS this ?	This is available on a " Drive In Double Feature " from Dark Sky Films , and since I just had finished up " Barracuda " , I watched this too . This is a film that proves to be incredibly ambitious and inept at the same time . We begin with two young ladies wandering the streets of some foreign town , but where exactly are they ? They stop to look at necklaces from some Chinese vendor , and try on Chinese-style clothes at a shop , but then we see some Aztec dancers ? And all the while , these girls are being followed by two guys , who eventually drop whatever stealth they didn't have to chase the girls on a wild run though the town , and they finally catch them . It seems that one of the girls has a coin on a string around her neck , and these guys want to find the loot , and where did she get it ? So , in flashback , we go back to find out . And how did they know she had this coin ? Hard to say , really . Now , back in the day , when these two women were 10 years old , they were out with their sisters and their sister's boyfriends on a boat , and after stopped to get air in their tanks , they tow this young boy back to his home dock , only to have his grandpa come out & invite the " young ' uns " up for herbal tea with granny . But not everyone has the tea , Todd has gone back to the boat to check on the young girls , and then when they're away from it , the boat blows up , and when they get back to the house their friends have mysteriously disappeared . Well , it seems as though these " kindly folk " raise their own vegetables but they wait for the meat to drop by for a spell , and serve it herbal tea . But the girls and Todd did leave the island , but now , they're returning , escorted by their captors , and they're there to find the treasure , despite the fact that no one ever showed the girls where it was BEFORE . There also seems to be someone else on the island , and the thugs mysteriously begin to die , one by one , and since there's only three , it doesn't take long . And there's even a sort of happy ending , which will leave the viewer every bit as baffled as they were throughout the rest of the film . The two thugs seem to be speed freaks with anger issues , and combined with no acting ability they're borderline hilarious . The hillbilly-type family is also devoid of acting ability , despite the fact that the grandpa is Hank Worden , who appeared in many films and TV shows . The action is confusing , the locales are even more confusing , and the island looks like Southern California . So what the hell IS this ? I'm not sure , but it certainly is worth seeing once so you can think ( or say ) , huh ? , very bizarre .
504549	2911571	95483	5.0	even though this was made in Indonesia , it screams " 80's "	I'm giving this a 5 based on its rich content of unintentional entertainment value , some of which can be attributed to " big hair " and " bad music " . Oh , and one mullet , that's important . The story . . . well , it starts out like some kind of legend of a South Seas woman who managed to kill of her lovers with a eel / dagger that she kept somewhere where an eel or dagger would fit easily . But someone manages to get the eel / dagger from here & she curses this person's ancestors , so 100 years later here's this anthropologist ( I think ) who gets this curse & all of a sudden , forget the dagger , she's armed with a machine guy . And this is one of those films where despite the fact that this woman can't be killed by gunfire , over and over again , they still continue to shoot at her . They being , the cops , etc . Of course these are special forces cops ( and for Indonesia , strangely of Western origin ) . And then there's Snake , the stoner dude with the mullet . I think he dies , at least I hope he did , I kind of forgot now that this is all over , but for a mullet , death is the only answer . As for the woman , she gets blown up , she gets shot at , and guess what ? She still keeps on coming . . . . but like with all good ( or bad ) movies , eventually they must come to an end , and I think this one could have ended because they had used up all the ammo available in Indonesia . This is one of those " can't believe I'm watching this " kind of films , stupid but actually kind of fun , if you're in the right mood . .
504879	2911571	60666	5.0	for fans of really bad horror . . . . . . .	I don't quite know what to say about this . I've seen the original version and I've seen the MST3K version , and this is quite possibly the most inept and meandering film I've ever seen . A man , his wife , and his daughter ( and their poodle ) are going on vacation at some resort , or so they think , and they stumble into a nest of supposed Devil Worshipers , led by " The Master " , a guy in a black cape with red hands on the front and he's got a Doberman and a harem of women in nighties . Plus , he's got Torgo , who has some definite anatomical problems , especially with his legs , perhaps gout or something ? Or maybe underneath those pants is supposed to be a satyr or something ? Dunno , we never see , thankfully . Anyway , we end up with a dead poodle and lots of discussion on the little girl growing up to be a woman , and lots of pointless laughter from The Master , not to mention a wrestling match between the nightie-clad women . Woo hoo . It's hard to believe someone could make a film so bad unintentionally but I suppose it's possible . This is not without redeeming values though , because if you have a sense of humor and wonder , you'll wonder what the hell they were thinking . , huh ? ?
504290	2911571	71318	5.0	An OK thriller with a sort of " Movie of the Week " feel to it	This is part of a double release that came out on ( with Earth Dies Screaming ) and I'd never seen , nor heard of this film before . It's about a bunch of people who are ostensibly chosen to be protected from a " nuclear exchange " in an underground bunker so that they can re-populate the earth when this war is over . There are 10 of them but there's one more person down there , an army major ( Richard Jaeckel ) who was there as a caretaker to run the computers , etc . Now of course , these people don't particularly WANT to be down in this bunker , even after seeing videos of the destruction on the surface , but after they find out what is down there WITH them , they want to be down there even less . Seems that this " bunker " was built inside of huge caves and what lives in caves ? Bats . And what's found its way into the bunker ? If you guessed " bats " you're doing well . But they aren't just bats , they're VAMPIRE bats , which means they suck . Blood , that is . And seeing real bats hopping along toward intended victims as they snooze is pretty downright creepy , if you ask me . . . made my skin crawl . This film , I'm sure , had a theatrical release way back when but it has sort of the look and feel of a 70's " ABC Movie of the Week " , except there are scenes that would never have made it onto network TV back then , not that they're anything to get too excited about . Not a bad story line , really , but it gets a bit silly and tedious at times . Oh , there's somewhat of a major twist to this too , but I won't reveal much about that except maybe the reason these people have been told that they are here for isn't entirely honest . .
504588	2911571	366555	5.0	horror comedy fluff	Can a horror comedy be called fluff ? Well , I'm calling this one fluff . The cover suckered me in , a young lady in a skimpy outfit with a chainsaw , and while she is the nicest thing to look at in the movie , well , let's just say I need to start bringing my glasses and actually READING the boxes before I buy movies . This is kind of The Evil Dead meets your basic scavenger hunt & " spend the night in a haunted house as a frat house / sorority house initiation " flick , and the scavenger hunt itself is actually more entertaining than most of the rest of the movie . As for the comedy parts , if you get big laughs from people biting their tongues off then this is right up your alley . I will admit this had a few good one-liners but overall it's a very fluffy movie , little of substance here & doesn't suffer overly from originality .
504489	2911571	86058	5.0	complicated revenge story	I was not sure what to expect from this when I watched it , but what I felt after seeing it was not that I'd just seen a great film . This was Sam Peckinpah's last , and while I'm not any fan of his I know he had done far better . John Hurt plays a CIA operative ( I guess ) and his wife is killed by order of the head honcho , as played by Burt Lancaster . Some time later , Hurt has devised a way to get back at his old boss via a TV talk show host , of sorts , as played by Rutger Hauer , who has a get-together at his place every year for some friends of his . However , these friends of his have now been presented to him as possible Soviet spies , and he's been shown taped footage ( that of course , only allows him to see seemingly incriminating conversations ) to prove that . So now he's housing some Soviet spies for the weekend and things turn tense and get out of hand , and so on . Meg Foster , who plays Hauer's wife , gets away with her son & their crossbows and comes back later for some target practice with the real thing . The rest of the guests pile into an RV and are heading for the hills but they won't get far . And then Hurt manages to kidnap Hauer's wife , son , & dog , in order to finally get what he really wants , to expose his old boss . It's not a bad story , I guess , but it's very confusing and complicated and completely lost me a few times , because ( I'm guessing here ) there are things that the film seems to assume that you know , as in , you've read the book by Robert Ludlum , which I hadn't . Of course , this was also Peckinpah's last film & if you know anything about him , he had his problems , and maybe this is the end result of some of that too , who knows . I wouldn't call this terrible , but it's certainly not very well executed and could have been far better in the right hands . .
503959	2911571	456055	5.0	a good look at times , tried hard , failed anyway	Dead Life is filmed in 16 mm , and at times it does have the look of a 70's film , and at times the way it's filmed is quite inspired . However , the story is nothing anyone's never seen , the acting is pretty amateur and as with most low budget films the sound level is so inconsistent at times you can't hear what's going on . The story is about some galloping plague that's taking over , it's spread via the water , apparently , and the only ones that don't get it aren't drinking the city water , apparently they're on a beer-only diet . The gore effects are cheesy , the zombies are mostly walking dead alternative-types , like skinheads , metal-heads , etc . , so it would appear . It does have some mesmerizing qualities in the choice of scenery and the way it was filmed at times , but unfortunately that's overshadowed by the balance of the amateur-hour stuff . Tries very hard , fails anyway due to the low budget and the mostly grungy cast , who it's very hard to like . Not terrible , not the worst I've ever seen , but not exactly something I'd recommend to anyone either . .
505392	2911571	1090360	5.0	Blair Witch Project meets Cannibal Holocaust " lite "	I don't think this was a terrible film but it does boast a group of actors that will get on your last nerve . After a while , you're hoping to see them die , and soon , please . The premise is that these young drifter types meet up in Fiji and decide to find out if they can find Michael Rockefeller , who disappeared in the wilds of New Guinea in 1961 . We have Mandy & Bijou , who are Aussies , and Mikey & Colby , who are American . Mandy has paired off with Colby & Mikey with Bijou . They have heard rumors that a white man in his 70's has been spotted in the jungle , so they decide to go see if they can find him . Obviously they're not up on their Italian cannibal movies . They set out across New Guinea to the Indonesian side of the island and leave their van to set off into the wild . What follows is almost endless squabbling because Bijou is somewhat of a " free spirit " and totally undisciplined , wants to drink & smoke the whole time and sleep all day instead of getting up and hiking . Mikey is an obnoxious jerk who sort of eggs Bijou on , and eventually those two build a raft & take all the supplies & set off down the river , with unfortunate consequences . Mandy & Colby also build a raft & manage to find Mikey and Bijou , but they're a bit worse for wear , to say the least . And all of this is captured on shaky camera for you to ponder what you're seeing , at times . Of course , like all stupid white folks in cannibal territory films , there is no happy ending . There's some pretty nasty moments but this is nowhere near as nasty as it could have been . It's entertaining to a point but nothing you haven't seen before . .
505152	2911571	138304	5.0	good ideas , poorly done movie	This is a movie with some good ideas but they don't seem to get put across very well . While on a space mission two astronauts who are outside the space shuttle end up being taken over by some alien force . Upon their return to earth one eventually dies of a stroke but the other ( Johnny Depp ) survives to impregnate his wife . With what ? Who knows . Let's just play it safe and say " twins " . Depp is miscast as an astronaut with a Southern accent ( and not a good one ) . He has a pretty wide acting range and is a very talented actor but he fares much better as eccentric types than a straight role . After the incident Depp retires from his job and takes a job at an aerospace company in NYC , where he and his lovely wife appear to live in an office building , although technically I think it's an apartment . What an ugly place . Anyway Depp seems rather obsessed with listening to static on the radio , and lovely Charlize Theron seems quite worried about him . With good cause . An ex-NASA guy follows them to NY and tries to warn her but Depp manages to nip THAT in the bud , but not before she gets her hands on a video the guy left for her . I guess it's not any big surprise that this never made it to theaters , and in the right hands it may have been better , but as it is it's a pretty slap-dash movie , and seems to be nothing much more than some sketchy X-Files episode . Just longer and more excruciating . , it's not terrible but it's not good either .
504463	2911571	61191	6.0	Astounding	If I were a psychiatrist I might like to do some time travel and chat with Jerry Warren ( and perhaps Bill Rebane ) about what motivated them to make the movies they made . Because these were some strange folks . I got the version of this put out by Mystery Science Theater 3000 , and watched the version without the snide comments . . . . hmm , as much as I hated that show I probably should have watched it WITH the commentary . This is the classic ( ? ) battle of good against evil as Batwoman and her minions ( scantily clad bimbos ) do battle against the evil Rat Fink and his gang of goofy thugs . I guess Batwoman is played by Katherine Victor , I can tell from the voice , after having seen her in " Frankenstein Island " ( which by the way is much better than this ) . She never breaks character , like Batman changing into his millionaire duds when he's not working . I'd say perhaps her outfit in this was the inspiration for many a late 70's punk rock chick , although it's hard to tell what's her hair and what's something else . . . feathers I guess . Bats don't have feathers , by the way , but whatever . This is not an overly interesting film , really , but it does hold oodles of mind-boggling stuff to look at , and wonder about . Like for instance , when one of Batwoman's assistants is captured Batwoman shows up to talk with the captors and is offered chocolate milk and macaroons . And in a scene near the beginning when the Batgirls are shaking their booties to 60's rock and roll there's this guy in the background that's gleefully clapping his hands to some OTHER rhythm than what we're hearing , or maybe it's just that he's a white guy , you know we ain't got no rhythm . This is pretty bizarre , to say the least , and if you're a cult and / or bad movie fan ( in many cases that means the same thing , I guess ) , you will probably want to see this if you haven't already been subjected to it . , must be seen to be believed .
504969	2911571	78235	6.0	The Seventh Woman	Just for the record , the Italian title of this film is " The Seventh Woman " . Three bank robbers on the run in their aging Citroen come across a remote beach house & find that as a perfect place to hide out . Trouble is , though , the house is occupied , by a few Catholic school girls and their teacher , who is also a nun . The sadistic bank robbers move right on in , kill the maid , and then proceed to have their way with a a couple of the girls and their teacher . One girl spurned one robber's advances with a deftly aimed comb handle to the groin area , and he's not doing too well , though . The girls , of course , and the nun , are not about to continue to be subjected to rape & torture , and eventually get the upper hand . This is no where near as nasty as " Last House On The Left " , it's more a rather pale imitation . Still though , it's a decent enough exploitation film , if you like that sort of thing , but there's nothing to elevate it above that particular distinction . .
504456	2911571	78067	6.0	the viewer may also struggle to avoid a comatose state	Patrick is a young man who has been in a coma for several years and is apparently a ward of the state , or something to that effect . He lies completely still and yet there's something going on with him that's not quite right . It seems that his current state is something to do with killing his mother and her lover in the bathtub with an electric heater and that led up to the way things are now . Along comes a young woman , who takes a nursing job at this hospital , and she picks up rather quickly that this place is rather strange and so is Patrick . Patrick seems to take a shine to her , even if he doesn't show it outwardly , and manages to somehow communicate with her . And through her . Now , it seems Patrick does some out-of-body stuff that threatens the lives of people around her , including a new beau that she is hanging out with . The matron at the hospital is afraid of Patrick and never comes into the room , except of course when the young nurse just happens to be feeling around under the sheets , oops . At any rate the somewhat wacko resident doctor decides to experiment on Patrick and decides his life must be ended but despite Patrick's lack of quality in his life he apparently decides to fight back . Overall this is a rather slow and relatively unexciting film , but it has a certain something to it that kept my interest . Most viewers will probably dislike this because it's not exciting or bloody or anything like that but for strange " horror " I guess it's not bad . Not exactly a classic but I kind of like it for some reason . .
504372	2911571	61094	6.0	Nostaligic junk	I used to watch Thunderbirds on TV when I was a kid , and when I found the VHS of this on the " sell " table of my local video store , I snagged it . Mostly my interest in this was having just seen " Team America , World Police " but I was a little surprised that the puppets in Thunderbirds did't have visible strings , I seemed to remember they did . Anyway , this is an interesting little novelty more than anything else , it's not great but it's entertaining . The music by The Shadows is wonderful ( and to think when I watched this as a kid I'd never heard of them ) . It's interesting to watch certain scenes that are obviously real human body parts interspersed with the puppetry . To say the acting is a bit wooden would be a cheap shot , though . Anyway , I did enjoy watching this but not sure I'd watch it again anytime soon . .
504262	2911571	112939	6.0	OK Japanese witchcraft thriller	Misa has just started at a new high school , and it seems that some of the kids there dabble in magic . Now , Misa herself seems to be knowledgeable about magic & there are rumors that at other schools she's attended that " people died around her " . There is some force at work in the area of her new school though , which appears to be someone committing murders in an area that forms a pentagon , at which the center is Misa's new school . Rarely can that be a good sign , it seems . For Misa and a bunch of her schoolmates are suddenly trapped inside the school by evil forces and Misa still cannot figure out who the source is . This starts out pretty well , and finishes up fairly well , but there are some bits in between where things seem to just crawl . . . too much talking , too little of interest going on . Still though , this is kind of fun in a way & has some decent effects . I'm looking forward to watching the rest of this series , of which this is the first film . .
504458	2911571	100991	6.0	undistinguished follow-up to " Tetsuo "	Hiruko the Goblin is a rather undistinguished follow-up to Tetsuo the Iron Man for this director . I guess you could call it a horror comedy , although it's really not that funny or horrific . It's pretty strange though , which is about its only saving grace , I guess . There is evidence that there's some kind of burial mound at a school that has been guarded for years , and due to circumstances one of the goblins is released and races around beheading people , only to have their heads show up on spider or crab-like bodies . Investigating all this is an archaeologist and the son of one of the people that has disappeared , and they race around with weird detection equipment and act frantic . I guess overall it's OK , it's just not what I'd expect from Tsukamoto at all , after seeing Tetsuo & Snake of June . It's more like a mindless throw-away type flick , the kind one used to watch in the summer a long time ago , and there's just not that much to it . Still though if you like Tsukamoto's films it's good to see at least once . .
504645	2911571	104567	6.0	weird and quirky	Hey now , I'd seen this around & I'm no Brad Pitt fan , but when I read in one of my movie guides that this was pretty surreal & qualified for induction into the " David Lynch Museum of the Weird " I though it would be worth a look . And it is , for the most part . The case says it's a " romantic comedy " ( yechh ) but it's much more than that , but what exactly is hard to pinpoint . Pitt is Johnny Suede , with a ridiculous hair style and the dream of being a star playing strange little songs . He's seeing this girl that claims her boyfriend beats her and then she decides not to see him anymore , then he takes up with Yvonne , who is a bit more strange . At one point he hooks up with some guy named Freak Storm ( Nick Cave ) who's sporting even a MORE ridiculous hairstyle and acting as an ' agent ' from his office , which consists of a derelict recliner in an alley . There's sure lots of strange imagery , and dream-like wandering scenes , and this is probably too slow for some folks to appreciate , but it was just strange enough to be appealing to me . Pitt is fairly low-key so he was OK in this . I'm not really sure how to describe this , it's very hard to categorize this but I did kind of like it . .
504244	2911571	60228	6.0	despite the " horror horn " and " fear flasher " , there's not much to be scared of here	" Chamber of Horrors " is something I'd seen a long time ago on " Creature Features " ( KTVU , Oakland ) , and I'd really forgotten it until I just watched it on DVD . This has just been released as one of Best Buy's " exclusives " , which means it's generally hard to get your mitts on , unless you luck out like I did . It is an entertaining film , but not a great film . Still , it's kind of fun . A man named Jason ( Patrick O'Neal ) seems to have a way with the ladies , but his way is killing them . As our film opens we see him wedding his recently deceased bride , who he strangled with her own hair . So obviously this is not a well-balanced man . He is arrested , but on the train to prison , he escapes while handcuffed to a big piece of metal on the train , and while sinking in water he removes his own hand to escape . Of course , later , he has his stump fitted for a set of utensils that all all sharp , pointy , and in every way , deadly . And guess what ? He wants revenge on those who " wronged " him . Two amateur " detectives " , who run a rather macabre wax museum , are assisting in trying to find this particular Jason guy , who has now shaved off his beard and is therefore " unrecognizable " as the man he used to be . Wayne Rogers ( yes , the guy from MASH ) , plays a police Sargent also hot on the trail . There are four key points in the film where there is a " fear flasher " and a " horror horn " which is meant to clue you in to when you should look away . But alas , this was made in 1966 , and the camera does all the " looking away " for you . . . . nothing in the way of gore here . Still though , this is an entertaining film , if not entirely memorable . .
505464	2911571	71212	6.0	Exorcist meets Rosemary's Baby , Italian style . . . now on Code Red DVD ! !	First things first . . . I got my copy of the Code Red DVD in the mail yesterday and watched it last night . It looks great , and there's even a small introduction with Juliet Mills where she compares the film to " The Omen " , before she's corrected . She also says it's a good film , but at that point she wasn't corrected , although technically she should have been . Despite the fact that it's a ripoff , I still like this film quite a bit . How can you not like a film where one of Mill's children is constantly slurping from a can of pea soup ? ( with a straw ) . At any rate , Mills is pregnant , and her baby is growing at an alarming rate , and so are her , uh , mood swings . Or maybe it's not mood swings , maybe it's something much , much worse , like demonic possession . Mills had dated a man named Dmitri ( Richard Johnson ) before she met her current husband , and Dmitri was a Satanist , and he's been lurking about , waiting to " help " , although he supposedly has been dead for some time . Of course there's lots of strange happenings in the house , and Mills spews a lot of nasty green stuff , and disappears mysteriously from time to time , and even eats a banana peel she finds on the sidewalk . . . when they showed that I though she was going to step on it and do some kind of slapstick , really . . . . it certainly would have fit the nonsensical style of the film . Technically , this would be called a real dog of a film , but I still like it . It has that sort of style ( or lack thereof ) that makes even the most terrible Italian films seem , well , entertaining , and perhaps not for reasons intended . Plus , it does have a lot of beautiful San Franciso locations , places where I've actually been myself , plus it does have a fine view of the Cypress Freeway that collapsed in the 1989 earthquake . But come on , someone who's not a tourist driving down Lombard Street to get home ? Yeah right . . . . This is not by any means a great movie , but it is rather a fun movie , and perhaps not for any reason intended . .
505659	2911571	67480	6.0	Graveyard of Unintentional Humor	For unintended humor and weirdness , you can't really beat this movie . However , for a coherent storyline and a good movie , well , there's plenty else out there to choose from . Seems that some gentleman has returned to his ancestral castle , where he and everyone around this small place only know one tune , and they either whistle it ( or in his case , play it on the harmonica ) all the time . It kind of sounds like " On Top Of Old Smoky " but not really . It also grates on your nerves after a while & I don't even know the significance of it . There's a mother and three sisters , who all dress in black ( and high heels , which are especially good for walking around in the snow , I guess ) and there's something about another sister that died during a c-section in order to remove a dead fetus , and she herself died at that point , or so it seems . At one point our " hero " or whatever he is , disappears too , for no apparent reason . There's a sinister grave digger who runs around in a ghoul mask & his partner , who is apparently a woman based on the fact that we keep getting shown her shoes underneath her robe . Best of all , we have a doctor that apparently suffers from " Super Marionation " Syndrome , that is , with his hair , eyebrows , and make-up , he looks like a puppet from " Thunderbirds " . Of course he's evil and up to no good , yeah , right , whatever . Then there's a monster of sorts , and you never see it until the very end , with good reason I guess . Up until the grand finale , you only see its eyes , which is probably the same scene played over and over , where the eyes shift back & forth . . . . but when you see the monster you'll probably understand WHY it was only shown at the end , it's so bad that you'll probably die of laughter . Looks a lot like something a small kid might draw to describe something they think is hiding under the bed . Anyway , I guess this has sort of a story to it to , more or less , it's really hard to tell because it's so awe inspiring with some of the other things trotted out for you to try to fathom . for unintentional entertainment , otherwise it'd be about a 1 or less . Ideal for fans of bad movies .
504640	2911571	82410	6.0	Must be seen to be believed	So this guy , Jerry Warren , who I don't think I'd ever heard of before this , must have been a disciple of Al Adamson or something . At any rate , I went into this not knowing exactly what to expect and I found this to be an film that's absolutely SO dreadfully and hideously bad that it's incredible entertainment . The basic story line is that 4 hot-air balloonists and their dog , Melvin , crash land on what they think is a deserted island , only to encounter leopard-skin bikini-clad babes that are part space alien , a mad scientist's wife ( and the mad scientist himself , holding forth from a hospital bed ) , holographic images ( well , sort of ) of John Carradine , repeating the same things over and over and cackling , a bunch of brain-dead ex-seamen who are zombie guards , two cackling old salts that do " odd jobs " and Cameron Mitchell as Jayson , who has been imprisoned for 17 years in what looks to be a building made of balsa wood from the outside . Oh , and there is a Frankenstein monster , but he's underwater for most oft he movie and doesn't show up till near the end . This lurches breathlessly from scene to scene , never stopping once to make sense , and the segues are so amazingly bad that you wonder if the disc skipped . There are an amazing array of gadgets and props to make your jaw drop , for instance , there's something called an oscillator that looks like either a small tackle box or lunch box , painted pink and balanced on one corner to spin endlessly when doing Frankensteiny things . There are all kinds of intangible things that happen , like some force that makes your hand tingle if you talk about certain things , like other places . . . ? ? ! ! And there are the zombie-dudes , who have no blood in the bodies but partake of a local narcotic , according to Mrs . Frankenstein / Von Helsing , whatever her name is . Hmm , so no blood , how does the narcotic effect them ? This is just an absolutely ridiculously bad movie , but it's vastly entertaining and fun , despite all that . I really can't say I would recommend this to anyone but if you like bad movies that provide oodles of unintentional entertainment , then this will be right up your alley .
505706	2911571	1031280	6.0	OK effort but isn't this kind of like " Feast " ?	Splinter involves the unexplained appearance of some kind of prick-like things that apparently perform somewhat like mold , according to the resident biology student that just happens to be trapped at a gas station with his girlfriend and some dangerous ex-con . The boyfriend & girlfriend are out camping , but have to give it up because the tent gets broken and they set out for a hotel , only to be carjacked by the ex-con & his doped-up girlfriend . While on their way somewhere they hit something in the road , one of these splintery things , apparently , which puncture a tire & the radiator , so they all end up at this gas station , where the doped-up girlfriend is promptly attacked by the former gas station attendant who has turned into one big prickly thing . So , the three surviving people hide out inside the gas station , occasionally visited by marauding prickly body parts & the usual possessed dead bodies banging themselves into bloody pulp against the glass . Overall , this isn't a bad little horror flick but it's somewhat derivative , it seemed , of Feast , only with less people . Isolated place under attack by mysterious critters , folks getting killed , etc . The possessed dead bodies & the prickly things aren't really shown very long or very clearly in order to get a good look at them ( as in with Feast ) . And of course , what's going on has no explanation . I won't say this is nothing you've never seen before ( couldn't tell , really ! ) but while it's an entertaining time-passer it's certainly not the future of horror . .
504532	2911571	68505	6.0	not the best of the Dracula lot , but still plenty enjoyable	Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee return in one of the many of the Hammer Dracula films , and this time they're in the early 70's in London . It seems one young man ( calling himself Johnny Alucard ) has taken the ashes of the fallen vampire back after Van Helsing seemingly killed him in the 1800's , and deposited them near hallowed ground , only to bring him back to life in the London of the 70's , with the usual blood-sucking results . We have a bunch of young people that like to hang out , drink , do drugs , and get up to mischief , and they are unwittingly drawn into the resurrection , resulting in plenty of dead bodies with a puzzling cause of death . Peter Cushing , though , as the descendant of Van Helsing , comes to the rescue & again manages to save the day . The best part of this film is the updating of the usual Gothic 1800's scenario , but this is by no means the best of the Hammer Dracula films . Still though , it's plenty enjoyable and worth seeing if you're a fan , and maybe even if you're not . .
504792	2911571	68504	6.0	The Lunatics Have Taken Over The Asylum	So this is a retitled " Dr . Tarr's Torture Dungeon " , eh ? Hmm , I tried to find it in my movie book but nothing seemed to match up with this . Anyway , in the tradition of great marketing ploys , this is touted on the box as being Monty Python directed by Fellini on acid . OK , there are some Python-esque moments but only in look , not in feel . I wouldn't doubt though that there was some acid involved in the making of this . It's OK , it's not bad , really , but it doesn't quite go far enough with some of the bizarre antics to be truly satisfying . It has its moments , and some scenes are pretty odd , but nothing really awe-inspiring . Visitors to a large asylum find that the tables have been turned on the doctor and his staff , and they're all imprisoned and the loonies are in charge . Visually interesting but as I mentioned , nothing to make you gape .
505195	2911571	378814	7.0	Sundown ? Strange things happen ALL THE TIM	Hey now , this is definitely , without a doubt , one of the best Brain Damage movies I've seen , which may not be saying much as some of the others are so abysmal , but this one is cult material , in my book . One strange thing is that sundown shouldn't matter much , because these vampires have no problem hanging out in the daylight . This is a pretty gruesome vampire gore-fest but it's also interspersed with some dark dark comedy , but it also contains moments of comedy that are almost goofy in nature , because they're just so ' out of left field ' . So we have some vampire gangsters , who've just been ripped off by one of their " bag men " I guess , who's taken the money and fled with his vampire girlfriend to parts unknown . We have a " rouge " female vampire who's out for vengeance . We have this male / female team that are " hit vampires " , I guess , who are stuck in the 80's , that are hired by the gangsters for protection . ( says Jimmy Fangs , the gangster leader , " I've got the Thompson Twins watching my back " ) . And , we have The Reaper , a kind of tracker / hit man who always wears a black cloak and hood , who is older than dirt and is supposedly disfigured ( hence , the hood ) . For someone that is to be so sinister and creepy , he actually provides a good deal of the comic relief . . . . . check out his rainbow-striped socks when he bends down in one scene . And let's by no means forget his wife , the vampire-psycho June Cleaver from Hell , complete with pearls , who goes absolutely ballistic every time hubby forgets to clean up after himself , unleashing a torrent of obscenities that would make Andrew Dice Clay blush . The best line in the movie comes from the rouge female vampire that's out for vengeance against the vampire that turned her in the first place : " Eating human flesh does not contribute to a healthy state of mind " . OK , so this is no work of cinematic genius but there was some imagination and humor put into this , and it's not your typical Brain Damage dump truck full of blood , although it is a bloody mess at times . I found it to be pretty darn good , myself , but it won't be for everyone that likes vampire movies . stars .
504664	2911571	118739	7.0	stupidly funny low-budget post-holocaust extravaganza	I was expecting to be disappointed after watching this but no , this is good stupid fun . Low-budget , filmed on Super 8 , but still plenty entertaining for what it is . Slangman is a guy who survives by his wits , and his dictionary , and he wanders the wastelands of post-holocaust earth . Seems that mankind did so well in their peace efforts they tried to bring the continents together to make one big happy country but with disastrous results . Slangman comes in contact with a tongueless savage whom he calls Atlatl , and together they set out to find " the source " which is supposedly something that will help the remaining people of earth . Along the way they pick up Femme , a brain-dead " actress " who Slangman is attracted to . They encounter all manner of mutants and slime-balls , sometimes with hilarious results . Eventually they find Dr . Obvious , who knows of the source and even where it is , and they must get to it although they're attacked by still more mutants . The humor is sarcastic & silly , and even at times , " Monty Python-ish " , although this is an American film . The effects are silly at times but imaginative at others , considering the low budget . If you're in the mood for a goofy post-holocaust film , this one's for you . .
503975	2911571	281810	7.0	a strange thriller	Here's a strange little thriller as an ex-heroin addict leaves NYC for the Cape Cod community of Atwater Commons to attend some kind of seminar on serial killer profiling ? Or something like that . Seems Atwater Commons is quite proud of their curmudgeonly resident author who wrote a book called " Dirt Boy " about a serial killer . Atwater Commons is like David Lynch's version of The Village from the 60's TV show " The Prisoner " , they have a weird radio station that doesn't extend beyond town lines and they're always up to something odd . And so is someone else as people keep turning up dead in the fashion of the killings from the book Dirt Boy . Our intrepid hero is onto the mystery and gathering clues , but little does he suspect the real truth , until he does some real digging , literally and figuratively . This is overall not a bad little mystery thriller but could have been better , obviously a lot of work went into it but it's lacking in some areas . Still though , it's not a bad little flick and worth seeing at least once . No wild special effects , no gore , a bit on the talky side , but not bad . .
505308	2911571	348008	7.0	low budget mix of horror and action mostly works	Here's a strange tale owing a bit to David Cronenberg ( especially Videodrome ) , David Lynch ( especially Blue Velvet with a tad of Lost Highway ) and perhaps a couple other influences I couldn't put my finger on . A strange young man ( Noble ) lives in a seedy hotel in a incongruously cheery room ( daisy wallpaper ) and receives a couple strange notes shoved under his door . He see some strange stuff on TV from a pirate station and goes in search of this attractive young woman ( played by Debbie Rochon ) and finds himself in a mystery . Who is this woman and does she exist ? He hooks up with some deranged folks like a guy with an umbrella and some serious complexion problems , and also some wacko pornographers . He is also having strange dreams and seeing some man that wears a white mask that nobody else seems to see . Despite the low budget it's a fairly effective film and even has a fairly decent shock that was totally unexpected ( well , to me , OK ? ) . I gave it a slightly lower rating because the low budget and the way it was filmed sort of detract a bit from the viewing experience but overall it's pretty darn strange and interesting . And what does it all mean ? Who the hell knows , but I liked it . A decent effort and fairly original despite the obvious influences . .
504270	2911571	74222	7.0	cheesy low budget horror comedy is kind of fun	From the director of Bloodsucking Freaks , " Blood Bath " is fairly bloodless and not straight horror , but rather a sort of cheesy horror comedy along the lines of movies like Deadtime Stories and such . This is a horror anthology with a wrap-around of actors having a dinner after working on a play together and they all have tales to tell . Certainly no masterpiece but then again , neither is Bloodsucking Freaks . They both have a rather scuzzy charm to them though , despite the low budget , and this is definitely entertaining if you don't mind little in the way of scares or gore . P . J . Soles , later of Carrie & Rock ' n ' Roll High School , is in this , but I didn't recognize her . And also Harve Presnell , who I believe is in Fargo many years later ? Not a bad little watch , nothing too exciting though but entertaining enough . . Now available on DVD from Subversive , too .
504448	2911571	365478	7.0	Not exactly screaming	I am disappointed . This is nowhere near as funny or weird as I expected and I certainly would expect better from Bruce Campbell . This is a tale that takes place in Bulgaria , why there I don't know , but it does . Campbell plays an " ugly American " type that comes with his wife on a business trip . In many ways he reminds me much more of John Cleese ( it's the mustache ) than Bruce Campbell , but I would have expected better of John Cleese too . Ted Raimi pretty much gives the funnier performance here as kind of a Russian Hip-hop Huntz Hall ( and assistant to inventor Ivan Ivanov , played by an almost unrecognizable Stacey Keach ) . Anyway , Campbell runs afoul of a knife-toting Bulgarian gypsy maid who also happens to be the ex-fiancée of their ex-KGB Russian cab driver , Yegor , and gets his skull bashed in , and Yegor himself doesn't fare too good either . Along comes Pavel ( Raimi ) to collect the bodies so the good doctor can experiment and we end up with two person's brains in one person's body , and they aren't exactly compatible . Campbell finds delightfully atrocious clothing in a bin to wear and cruises around on a pink Vespa , and also engages in a bit of rehashed " Evil Dead II " shtick and he smacks himself around with his own hand . There are a few encounters with Euro-trash thugs and gypsies and the like , oh , and by the way Campbell's wife also gets experimented on and her brain ends up in the body of something like a crash-test dummy . This is mildly amusing , and mildly weird , and mildly intriguing , but certainly not screaming . For a better taste of recent Campbell goofiness that is more weird and bizarre , try Bubba Ho Tep if you haven't seen it . It's a more satisfying watch . .
505326	2911571	69986	7.0	marvelous crap	I read somewhere where this marvelous Z-grade Ted V . Mikel's film was the ' inspiration ' for " Charlie's Angels " , and if so , I guess someone was really desperate . This is a fun cheesy exploitation flick but not exactly inspirational . A space shot gets blown up after lift-off and there was a threat that had gone ignored by a senator , and he now feels badly that he didn't look into it further . Now he sends out a cry for help ( after the astronauts blew up ) and the Doll Squad ( led by tough gal Sabrina ) is the squad of choice , I guess . The girls are gathered up but not quickly enough as someone's killing them off as fast as they can be contacted , but luckily the killing is stopped and the squad is formed and ready for action . I guess the scenes where one woman is smoking a cigarette by holding it with her thumb and index finger is supposed to convey the idea that she's no dainty thing , but it doesn't quite fit her hair-do and outfit , oh well . Tura Satana is also one of the girls in the squad but sadly , she's not in the forefront most of the time , like in Astro Zombies and in that other director's film , Faster Pussycat . She was a great exploitation / cult film star but man , she has one scary visage . Luckily she had a personality and presence that overrode that . Anyway , these gals run around , kill bad guys , plant bombs , and do all kinds of cool stuff while wearing matching pant suits and platform boots , perfect for running around the desert . Two of them also stop at a check point and talk to the guards there , who of course stop them , but they get away after offering them cookies and vodka . Yes , vodka , but it's not just any vodka , it has something in it that makes the guards explode from within . Which brings me to the explosions in this movie . They're something akin to an old flashbulb or something like that , things don't so much explode as flash and disappear . Except at the end when buildings blow up , then it looks like a fireworks show superimposed over the buildings . Anyway , this is fairly enjoyable crap , if you're in the mood for some decent unintentional laughs and cheesy entertainment . .
504354	2911571	289944	7.0	weird journey into Lynch territory	This is a very strange , eerie movie about a Wisconsin security guard who is obsessed with finding the killer of his wife . His wife was mysteriously killed by a man at the mall where he works . His obsession leads to watching surveillance tapes over and over again looking for clues and piecing them together . He asks about a strange house , one across the road from where he lives , ostensibly to move there but the real estate agent tells him it is leased to some corporate account . He then breaks in and finds photo negatives which he has developed and goes in search of the people in the photograph which leads him to Montana . I guess while watching I did find out who killed his wife but the why was really never explained , it was all quite sinister . A lot of this reminded me of the films of David Lynch and probably that's why I liked it , but it also left me feeling like I missed something and that perhaps ( here & there ) there were gaping plot holes . I mean , I can certainly see someone carrying around a picture of their wife and kid but a negative ? Anyway , this does rate pretty high on the strange scale and yeah , it's a tad on the slow side but I personally found it to be fascinating and liked it pretty well . Not top notch but if you're a Lynch fan & like odd movies then you should have no problem with this . .
504109	2911571	64828	7.0	what am I to make of this ?	This is my first Pasolini film and if I am to believe one reviewer , Water Bearer Films has screwed up the sequence of reels but while I wondered about the reel change showing up on the screen , you couldn't prove it by me . Since it seems to be rather tough to figure out what exactly the purpose of this film is anyway . I did find this pretty fascinating but I'm not enough of a cinematic genius or a metaphor seeker , so perhaps some of this was lost on me . There are two tales that intertwine , one of a young cannibal in medieval times and one of a young man in modern times and his rather disturbing family . Seems this young man is rather disturbed himself as well , something to do with pigs , which is implied rather than shown , thankfully . I don't know exactly how this was supposedly to have been laid out in its original form and it's so jerky anyway that if I've had the wool pulled over my eyes by the distributor I wasn't aware of it , but that's also rather disappointing that if the parts of the film are out of sequence that they wouldn't know enough or care enough to make it right . At any rate this is certainly strange and kept my attention till the end , although it is rather talky and doesn't necessarily make lots of sense , but there is a sense of wrongness about it that made it appealing to me , and I did like it , to an extent . I doubt I'll be paying hundreds of dollars any time soon for the Criterion version of ' Salo ' so I guess I'll let this be my intro to Pasolini and leave it at that until these slackers re-release what I've heard to be his best , yet most disturbing , work . .
504133	2911571	64888	7.0	Now on DVD , but does this deserve the " Elvira " treatment ?	What was anyone thinking when it was decided that " La Residencia " ( The House that Screamed ) should be put out as part of Elvira's " Movie Macabre " series , complete with her comments ? Luckily , the film can be watched without Elvira's patter , but still , it's been edited to allow for those little touches of her wit , and there are fades as in when a TV film goes to a commercial . Still though , the quality of the film is good & it IS widescreen , so it isn't a total loss , but this is much too classy of a film to get the Elvira treatment . The story is that of a girl's school in France , run by Lilli Palmer , and the girls are a bit on the " difficult " side , so of course they do things like have sex with the hired help and things like that , all the while covering for each other . Palmer has a " delicate " son too , but he's also a bit curious about the girls and has devised many ways to spy on them , especially while they're in the shower . But some of the girls are disappearing , and why ? Madame thinks it's because they've run away , but none of them have left , not under their own power , anyway . One particular scene of a girl getting stabbed in slow motion is quite effective as the music winds down and she hits the ground , a gout of blood spouting from her mouth . Also quite effective is the scene where one of the girls goes to the woodshed for a " roll in the hay " while the others sit frustrated in embroidery class . . . . with the girl's moans imposed over the scene . Lots of needles thrusting through fabric and even a needle being threaded , no subtle symbolism here . This is a rather slow-moving yet creepy film , and the ending was rather unexpected . The run time on the box shows 114 minutes , and I'm not sure if that's with or without Elvira , but even with I think it's pretty close to the original run time so it's probably not cut . It would be nice to see this in a respectable presentation though , but for now this is all that's commercially available in the US . .
505232	2911571	443756	7.0	Dolly Dearest from the Land of the Rising Sun . . . .	Here's a strange little Japanese flick that combines elements of Dolls , House of Wax , Crucible of Terror , and who knows what all else . I guess it's not a ' professionally ' made film either , since it has the look of being filmed on video yet still manages to succeed rather well . It's rather gruesome it parts , yet it does have a strange sense of humor to it . Seems like there is an artist that makes dolls , very expensive dolls , that is a loner and works in his isolated studio . He has a rather unsavory assistant , who has apparently taken over a lot of his work in creating dolls but not in the way that he was originally making them . Now you can forget about credibility , since when people get water from this pond on them they turn to wax , and therefore they can be made into dolls . The assistant has also fashioned a machine that uses pond water in a more efficient way than having to chase down the victim and push them into the pond . So we have a bunch of missing girls and a bunch of dolls that seem to be created from them , although they're not apparently , entirely dead or entirely alive . This is a surreal and strange film , and at times you haven't really a clue what's going on , but it was still very interesting to watch and while it lacks high production values , it's still worthwhile to see , if you're a fan of Asian weirdness as I am .
504835	2911571	323630	7.0	An interesting premise ( maybe a minor spoiler )	An investigative reporter is plagued by phone calls and changes her number and relocates to a big empty house owned by her sister and brother-in-law , after writing some articles that exposed public figures for doing naughty things . Apparently the phone calls haven't stopped though , because her niece picks up the phone while the woman and her sister are at a museum , and whatever she hears sends her off the deep end . The key seems to be the identity of the person that had this particular phone number previously . This is a fairly decent film that uncovers dark secrets where there don't appear to be any , and some of the revelations are quite surprising . The niece is a cute little thing , until she gets one of her " spells " and then she becomes the child from hell that puts many of the other " child from hell " films I've seen to shame . Some decent twists and turns make this worthwhile , but it could have been a little better , I thought . Perhaps I wasn't in the mood when I watched it , but it's by no means a bad film . .
505594	2911571	455760	7.0	better than average but minus a point for Donnie Wahlberg	I thought Dead Silence was full of lots of creepy imagery and goings-on , and it was a pretty solid horror flick , but the irritating prescence of Donnie Wahlberg was somewhat of a distraction . A man and his wife receive a mysterious package , which contains a ventriloquist dummy , hmm , no return address ? But they of course just rip it open and hubby leaves his wife to go pick up Chinese food and returns home to find out she's dead in a rather nasty fashion and after that Wahlberg is glued to his butt for the remained of the film . Now , both this man and his wife are from some small town called Raven's Fair where the local populace were fearful of some old woman called Mary Shaw , who was apparently responsible for rather nasty goings-on back in the day , and she was a ventriloquist but also apparently some kind of a witch , and she had tons of dolls that she lived with . Parents used some poem about her to scare their kids into submission when they acted up , apparently . So the young man returns to his hometown to make funeral arrangements for his wife and encounters plenty more strangeness . His father has had a stroke and his new " stepmother " is a few years older than he is , and there haven't been much happy family feelings for years . The local mortician has a loony wife that seems to be a late-stage alzheimer's victim and tells him plenty of strange things too , and there's also a creepy theater on a lake that holds many dark secrets as well . And all the while , the presence of Wahlberg , making sarcastic comments and acting all the while like the young man is the prime suspect in the killing of his wife , which absolutely rubbed me the wrong way . If you can get past Wahlberg though , this is truly a well-made creepy film , but it has a few holes , hey , it's a horror movie . I thought it was far better than most of what I've seen these days that tries to pass itself off as horror and I certainly would buy it when it's out on DVD . Definiltely eerie & the settings are a big plus . .
505025	2911571	56220	7.0	OK early Franco	This is your basic family-with-a-curse flick , starring the ever-present ( at least for Franco's films ) Howard Vernon as a baron suspected of deaths of young ladies in the area of his castle , most notably , the swamp , where his ancestor did his evil deeds many years ago . Of course the police and a news reporter are on the case , and are out to catch someone for these deaths . Decent enough spooky atmosphere , enough red herrings to make you wonder , and ( surprise ! ) nudity , for 1962 , huh , go figure . This isn't bad but it's not great , and you may figure out who the killer is long before it's revealed . It's interesting to see Jesus Franco's older films before he got too " out there " although I do enjoy some of his " out there " stuff as well . .
505302	2911571	491197	7.0	at least this has more plot and less naked old men	I had ordered 2 films by Giuseppe Andrews at the same time from different places so saw " Period Piece " before I saw this and thought , what the hell have I bought ? Thankfully , " Touch Me In The Morning " at least has something of a plot and doesn't prominently feature any 80-year old man rubbing pork rinds on his body . . . however , it does feature more than enough disgusting people and acts to rival the earlier films of John Waters for sheer . . . uh . . perversion , yeah , I guess that's it . Some young man named Coney Island ( Andrews ) kind of drifts through life . His mom is a addled coke fiend and his dad is a drunk , and they're not together anymore , mom lives in a trailer park and dad lives in some motel . Coney goes around during the day with his Casio keyboard & makes up tunes to cheer up old folks & shut ins . His mom either has Alzheimer's or is far gone , his dad is a disgusting pig who hangs out with disgusting friends and drinks and smokes dope , and the birthday party for dear old dad is something to behold too , with a cheery and accommodating stripper / prostitute , complete with stretch marks , bleah . . . . In other words this is thoroughly perverted , disgusting , and you won't want to know how Andrew's came up with his ideas , I guarantee you . Some of these same folks are featured in his other films , I have to think they're people he must know , because my first though in looking at most of them is that I would not go near them . , uh . . . what talent .
505691	2911571	68284	7.0	interesting take on " Dracula "	William Marshall plays Mamuwalde , an African prince visiting ( unfortunately ) Count Dracula in Transylvania , with his beautiful young wife , Luva . They are basically campaigning against slavery , but when the Count expresses some rather unpopular ideas on that subject , his guests start to leave , only to be attacked and bitten by the undead , and Mamuwalde is re-christened " Blacula " . Fast forward to the present ( which in this case was 1972 ) and two " faggot interior decorators " have bought the castle in which all this took place , and are delighted to have a big coffin to take back to L . A . with them too . Of course you know who is inside and as soon as the coffin is opened , Mamuwalde ( who by now is very thirsty ) attacks . Pretty soon the police realize that they have a very strange problem on their hands . Dr . Gordon Thomas & Lt . Jack Peters are on the case but they aren't entirely sure what they're dealing with . To complicate matters , the sister of Dr . Thomas's " main squeeze " is a dead ringer for Luva , Mamuwalde's dead wife , so of course he has the hots for her . More and more people get bitten , etc . . . . typical vampire stuff , but the creepiest resurrection is a cab driver who has been in the morgue who launches herself at morgue attendant Sam ( Elisha Cook Jr . ) from down the hall , in slow motion , one of the creepiest scenes in the film . Not timid about feeding time is this lady . Overall this is a fairly decent film for " blaxploitation " and it also seems to have a bit of commentary on race relations , although I can't be sure that's how it was intended . .
505484	2911571	76164	7.0	A fun and goofy flick , not to be taken seriously ( no matter HOW it was made )	It's hard to say with some Asian flicks whether they were made to be serious or if they were made as spoofs . If this one was made to be serious , it's also an excellent spoof . The story is not that much different from that of King Kong , except home base is Hong Kong & the Peking Man has been spotted in the Himilayas , so a heart-broken explorer and a team of men head off to find it . Our heart-broken explorer had just caught his fiancée in bed with a friend and therefore was ready for anything to get out of town , but maybe this . . . he finds the Mighty Peking Man but he also finds Ah Wei , a beautiful blonde who wears a ragged loincloth and top , who can communicate with Peking Man & also all the other animals in the jungle , except for perhaps a cobra , which bites her . Seems like she was in a plane crash with her parents years ago & they died but she lived with the animals . After bidding a tearful farewell to her favorite leopard ( which is shown making choked-up faces when she walks away ) she sets sail for Hong Kong with Mighty Peking Man chained to the deck of the ship , and from then out out it's more or less like " King Kong " only funnier . There's the obligatory shoot-out on a tall building at the end , and the usual treachery from those who don't understand . Strange that Ah Wei communicates with Kong in " native language " in the jungle but then in English towards the end , maybe he's as fast a learner as she is . Some of the earlier parts of this film are beautifully done , and somewhat fun and exhilarating , but it bogs down a bit toward the end with the seemingly endless shoot-out . There's some truly priceless bits in this , like someone getting their leg bitten off by a tiger near the beginning , and a gun battle with rear-projected elephants , and so on . A fun film , hopefully not meant to be taken seriously but if it was , you won't . .
505448	2911571	68415	7.0	A decent little thriller	This is a decent little thriller that takes place in Scotland but it's an Italian film . Now , apparently Blue Underground put some restored footage in or something because suddenly we take a few brief detours from Scottish brogues into Italian with subtitles ? Hmm , that kind of ruined the mood , but still , this is a perfect movie for a rainy day or evening because it's got some creepy moments and you're not sure really what's going on up until the end , without suspecting for a moment who the killer is . At least I didn't . The witness to all the murders in this movie is a big yellow cat , and yet my big yellow cat didn't care to watch the movie , go figure . The cat was apparently distraught his mistress was killed and threw itself on the coffin , which , apparently , is a legend in Scotland ; when a cat follows a corpse it means that person is a vampire . Doesn't help when the woman is mysteriously no longer in her coffin , either . Anyway , this is kind of a cool little film , no great shakes but still not a bad little " giallo " , and yes , I think it's one of those . . . . it's never referred to as one but I think it fits the bill . Good gloomy day material . .
503930	2911571	437857	7.0	A great " how to " guide using your basic " horror clichés "	Behind the Mask : The Rise of Leslie Vernon , is the take of an up-and-coming young man who see himself as a possible successor to the throne of Jason Vorhees , Freddy Krueger , and Michael Myers . It begins as a small group of grad students film & interview this young man as he lays out the groundwork for his rise to notoriety . But somewhere along the way , the grad students realize that this is perhaps a little more than they bargained for and they have second thoughts about their complicity in Leslie's schemes . Now Leslie has staked out his prey , and he's divided the potential victims into categories , including the lone girl that has the distinction of being the " survivor " . She's a good girl , she's a virgin , and she keeps away from the alcohol & drugs . Of course , Leslie has made one mistake in his assumptions but you'll have to see the film to find out why . Leslie has also set up the location for the spree he's planning , and it's the old farmhouse where the young boy , who he is stealing the identity of , was dragged out & thrown over a waterfall many years ago , and now he's poised to " come back " for vengeance . Leslie has made a lot of preparation for his rise to infamy , including plenty of cardio and training , for all those long chases through the woods . Leslie is also a former mental patient but he does play that down a bit . There's also an " Ahab " , a rescuer , a sort of adversary , in a character played by Robert Englund , of all people , who knows ( or seems to ) what's going on and is bound to stop it . This is a very clever film and comes off as sort of a cross between " Man Bites Dog " and your basic clichéd horror flick . But it makes use of those clichés as though they were some kind of training course for the demented killer . A fun , clever , and twisted little horror romp & some of it's genuinely funny . Well worth seeing , .
505572	2911571	76478	7.0	let's get one thing straight here	What exactly do people expect when they watch an Al Adamson film ? Are they expecting classic cinema that is wonderful beyond belief and will leave them with lasting memories ? You'd think so by some of the reviews . Al Adamson's films are trashy and sleazy and cheesy , not much more , so if you go into them knowing that already it helps , and they aren't necessarily to be taken at face value , especially when they have so much unintentional entertainment value . First off , this starts by ripping off the end theme music from Outer Limits , so you know things are looking promising . This is the story of some wacko cult that lives in the hills and while trying to raise a dead body , the leader suffers a heart attack and ends up in the hospital . Of course Nurse Sherri tends to his needs and all , and when an operation is needed she just happens to be hanging out in the operating room when the guy passes on so his spirit invades her . And Nurse Sherri begins to change . No longer the nice nurse , she develops a taste for blood and sharp objects . There's a couple little side stories going on like folks trying to burn the body of the dead cult leader and a blinded football star that has become the love object of one of Sherri's co-workers who also just happens to dabble in voodoo . This is not bad if you're a cult film fan , but it may be bad if you're a " Spiderman " fan because you won't like it . At times this actually lurches towards " respectability " ( for Adamson , anyway ) but then it " unredeems : itself with some ridiculous event . If you enjoy Adamson's films and similar trash you may well like this , for anyone else who may be looking for a lost treasure , keep digging . .
504805	2911571	130216	8.0	Pretty weird for its time	Hey now , this is one weird flick for when it was made , about 1977 from what the ending credits said . I'd say it was pretty much " experimental " , because it has some artsy-fartsy moments that are just out of left field . Some people get invited to their high school reunion and upon arriving there are only 6 of them ? But there's lots of food and drink so they party hearty , and good thing too because that's probably the last time they'll ever do it . There's a reason for their choosing , too , one's gay , one's lesbian , one's adulterous , the rest , well , they must have done SOMETHING wrong , I'm not sure exactly what all was going on . Now keep in mind this is a tad hard to follow , but it sure has some inspired weirdness . Various disguises are used by the killer to stalk his victims , and while it's not terribly scary it is pretty interesting to watch , overall . I'd say this won't be to everyone's taste , but if strange horror movies are your calling , give it a look .
505094	2911571	470132	8.0	feudal Japanese werewolves and Yokai , oh my !	A cool little Japanese flick taking place in maybe the 1800's , in which a lone wanderer ( Kibakichi ) takes on thugs and then takes shelter in a small village of Yokai , which are monsters in human form that are trying to hide away from men . But Kibakichi seems to fit in pretty well here , being that he's not exactly human himself . Enough sword-play and gore and horror to please any fan of that sort of thing , plus a very interesting period setting that's always dreary and gloomy . Kibakichi is accepted by the villagers and takes up residence there , and helps them when they're under attack by humans who want to test out their new guns . As I read from some other reviewer , they picked this up at Blockbuster used , on a whim , and gee , so did I , and I was very pleased at how good it was . If you're a fan of Asian cinema , most likely you'll enjoy this . .
504206	2911571	122515	8.0	three twisted tales of scuzzy Scots	Here's 3 twisted tales by the guy that wrote " Trainspotting " and it comes complete with subtitles because thanks to the thick accents you can barely make out what the actors are saying , although technically it IS English . In the first tale a young man who is rather a worthless sort is turned into a fly by God ( who he meets in a pub ) and takes his revenge on his family , friends , and rivals . In the second tale , a young man marries the pregnant town slut , and even though the baby isn't his it becomes quite important to him even though his wife is still up to her old tricks , especially with creepy new neighbor Larry . In the third tale a young man is struck by lightning while on an acid trip ( Super Mario ? ) and changes personalities with a baby being born nearby . This is all pretty strange and these tales are populated with all manner of scary and weird characters . Very entertaining and odd , and if you enjoyed ( ? ) Trainspotting and its imagery and tone , you'll like this . .
504967	2911571	412019	8.0	a stalker in a Taurus	I had my doubts about this because I don't care much for Bill Murray , but I figured , well , it IS Jim Jarmusch , so how bad can it be ? And frankly , it's not bad at all , in fact it was rather good & yes , almost touching . Bill Murray plays Don Johnston , confirmed bachelor and alone again now that his latest lady-friend left him . He receives a mysterious pink letter stating he has a son from one of his previous , uh , couplings , and with the help of his amateur detective neighbor Winston , he is sent on a quest to find which of his old girlfriends sent him the letter . First visit leads him to the house of a woman who has an apparently shameless daughter " Lolita " , who is appropriately named although she doesn't get the joke . When she walks into the living room where she's told Don to wait ( since her mom would be home shortly ) without a stitch on to get her cell phone , Murray is rather appalled , to say the least . Oops . He then meets up with the next lady friend who is now part of a husband and wife Realtor team , and spends an uncomfortable dinner with them . Then on to an " animal communicator " , a woman who talks to and understands pets , where he's scoped out by a cat that says he has ulterior motives . Wow . And finally a visit to Penny , a biker chick living out in the middle of nowhere with some sensitive and well-mannered biker types ( one of which is played by Larry Fessenden ) . This particular visit doesn't go well & Don ends up with a black eye . Now , as all this goes on there is still no indication that any of these women sent him this mysterious letter . Back home again , Don begins to suspect that this young man he's seen around is the mystery son , and makes some serious blunders in talking to him . . . This has a rather sad and inconclusive ending to it but it was also rather fitting . I rather prefer the Jim Jarmusch of old ( Down By Law , Stranger than Paradise ) but everyone changes a bit as time passes and I suppose I would be disappointed if he was up to the same old thing . This is a very good and Murray is very acceptable in a deadpan and dry-humored way . I won't say everyone will enjoy this but I guess it all depends on your sense of humor . , I recommend it .
504598	2911571	60955	8.0	far ahead of its time	In watching " Seconds " the thing that struck me was how far ahead of its time it was , for the mentality of the film is not that of the 60's at all . A man with a solid , yet unhappy life , is contacted by an old friend , supposedly dead , who offers him something , but what , exactly , he isn't sure . Turns out it's somewhat of a chance to start over again in life , under a new identity , and with a new face , with the past life obliterated by a faked death . The trouble is that you can never go back and the man finds himself thinking his old life wasn't so bad after all but there are penalties for such thinking . This is a rather creepy film and uses lots of strange camera tricks , angles , and lenses . Sometimes when a character is moving it's almost as if they were standing on the dolly with the camera and gliding along rather than walking . An unnerving and strange film that isn't exactly uplifting but well worth seeing because there's nothing else like it that I've seen . .
504712	2911571	294929	8.0	More a drama than a horror movie or ghost story	I have to wonder why Tartan puts out this ' Extreme ' series and includes in it everything from Asia , ' extreme ' or not . For this is not really a horror movie & not really a ghost story , but it's more a long and slow but compelling drama about the occupants of a run-down apartment building , and their interactions . A taxi driver moves in , and befriends his next door neighbor , who is a writer . Also in this building is a woman who works at 7-11 ( yes , they can have 7-11 in Korea but not here in Kentucky ) . This woman has an abusive husband from whom she is apparently separated , and with the help of the taxi driver she becomes even more separated from him . This woman also lost her son at some point , how is not really known until very late in the film and it's only shown briefly . As time has passed this woman has become more and more detached from her fellow humans and seems to be more than happy with the taxi driver , that is , until they quarrel . Seems that maybe he's not such a nice guy after all . It also seems , thanks to the writer , that he may actually be the son of a woman who used to live in the apartment in which he now resides , but you're never sure . This film builds up to be a low-key thriller but the last part moves up a notch to chiller . I found this to be somewhat slow going but overall worthwhile , it's both compelling and sad , and if you have the patience to work your way through such films then you may well find it worthwhile too . If you're the type that fast forwards when you get bored because there's no car chases or explosions though , you'll do well to stay away . .
505440	2911571	427157	8.0	Pretty good for a " made for TV " flick	This is a pretty good made for TV flick of the ' what if ' variety . As in , what if terrorists exploded a ' dirty bomb ' in a big city , in this case , London . Lots of poking at folks that say ' we're all set in the event of an emergency ' that then reveal that they're not exactly telling the full story . And is anyone prepared for something like this ? You can bet not . This shows the material for the bombs being smuggled into the country , the making of the bombs , the secrecy and double lives that the people behind it lead , etc . It also shows public servants ( i . e . , firemen ) giving their all to save people when they aren't getting any help , when the government doesn't want to send anyone else into the affected area . Also shows how woefully inadequate ' preparations ' are for any such occurrence , as the government talks everything up but then stands there with their mouths hanging open as the tragedy unfolds . And could this happen right here in the good old USA ? Well , unless you've been living in caves for the past 20 years something already has , to an extent , and don't bet that anyone would be prepared for something of this nature . This is fairly realistic and yes , even scary . Well worth seeing but just hope nothing like this ever really happens . .
505299	2911571	217679	8.0	an intelligent movie while still having a high squirm factor	The nerdy son of a doctor has come up with a serum that's supposed to increase endorphins to block pain and generate happiness . He calls it myson ( MY SON ) in honor of the father he never met . When his mother is conducting test experiments on three young ladies with a new contraceptive , he manages to slip some of his new serum into the mix , resulting in the three women having extreme reactions to the drug . Pain becomes pleasure and the more pain , the more pleasure . One narcissistic woman becomes obsessed with body piercing ( pens , awls , jewelry , whatever will poke through skin ) , another ( who loves food ) finds she herself tastes pretty good , removing various body parts for her dining pleasure , and even cooking her hand in tempura for a real taste treat . Most of this is not easy to watch . But the really disgusting and gory scenes are not what this is all about , but when they're there , they're quite effective . Now Eiji ( the doctor's son ) has found himself falling in love with the third girl , who is an insomniac , and who may or may not be responsible for some gruesome killings , it's hard to say ; is what you're seeing real or is it a cactus-generated visual ? Because this young lady goes into periods of rest hooked up to a large cactus in her apartment via what appears to be virtual reality headsets or some such thing . Yep , it's weird , and it's disgustingly gross at times , but it's also a pretty damn good film and well worth seeing , if you don't mind subtitles or nasty gore . , very interesting and different .
504841	2911571	65595	8.0	pretty creepy thriller with great atmosphere	Michael Gough plays a rather sadistic and nasty , overbearing father to Jane & an even less pleasant husband to Edith , and after Jane is beaten for supposedly stealing money , mother and daughter decide once and for all to dispose of dear old dad . The opportunity comes when brother Rupert is away on business and Walter ( Gough ) decides to go to his hunting lodge , where mother and daughter confront him and poison him . But later , the body has seemingly disappeared ( at least for a while ) and all looks as it should . . . bed is made , things are tidy . However , mother & daughter do find dear old dad in a crate , and as soon as possible they hurry to take it away and push it into a quarry . So they've rid themselves of their oppressor , or HAVE they ? This is a pretty creepy film and has an excellent atmosphere of dread to it . Gough play his part to the hilt , as usual . The trouble of this thing is , is dad dead or not ? Or have mother and daughter just been daydreaming ? Hard to say , but still this is a worthwhile film to seek out for those who appreciate early 70's horror , because it has plenty of the elements that make those films great and it's a nasty little gem . . On DVD from Trinity , a bit murky but otherwise not bad , for an inexpensive release .
503922	2911571	454841	8.0	takes the original and kicks it up a few notches	I reviewed this a few months ago after having seen the film in the theater , but now having viewed it on DVD ( the unrated version ) I decided to give it another shot . This takes Wes Craven's original , which is now almost 30 years old , and makes it look like a walk in the park . The gore and unpleasantness are kicked up several notches and the mutant cannibalistic hill folk are even explained somewhat . They were miners that refused to abandon their land and paid the consequences by being exposed to radiation . These folks make the crew from the original ( and yes , even Michael Berryman ) look about as scary as The Munsters . The basic storyline is the same , a family on a cross country trip to San Diego takes the scenic route , and when they stop for gas at one of those " last stop " gas places they're told of a " short cut " by the station attendant who is in cahoots with the hill folk , they give him treasure and he sends them dinner . There's a couple diversions from the original story , one as the son-in-law finds a crater full of abandoned vehicles and another as he finds a test village , full of mannequins put there by the government as part of their nuclear testing . Of course the mutants moved right in , and don't seem to mind sharing with the mannequins . I will say that this improved upon a second watch , and that this being the " unrated " version it had a couple minutes more footage that I don't recall from the theatrical version , mostly things that were too disturbing for an R rating , I guess . This is a very disturbing movie , and perhaps it's because it was in the hands of the gentleman that gave us " High Tension " . Who knows . But , I will admit , this is probably one of the few remakes that have come out in the last few years that actually surpasses the original . Don't get me wrong , I still LIKE the original , but it certainly pales in comparison to this . .
503960	2911571	492912	8.0	Interesting and well-done take on Frankenstein	Sujbect Two is about an unwitting med student who suffers from headaches that responds to an email from someone he'd been corresponding with that invites him to an isolated cabin in the Rockies to participate in an experiment . What he didn't realize was that he'd be killed in his first few minutes there and then resurrected and killed again time after time as part of this " experiment " . Mad doctor Vick ( Dean Stapelton ) should have been warning enough since he looks like a cross between Michael Ironsides and Jack Nicholson and swills whiskey all day long . I was surprised how good this was though , really , a friend that doesn't generally like these sort of movies had seen it when his wife rented it and told me about it . The isolated setting works very well and Christian Oliver is great as the dead-again-alive-again Subject Two . And by the way , Subject One is lying in a snow drift near the cabin and is visible until it snows again . This has a good deal of dark humor to it but it's also rather creepy at times , especially when one realizes how much of Adam is still in this creation , even though he's been killed and resurrected numerous times . Definitely a good watch , really more a " thriller " than a horror flick but a fairly satisfying watch . .
504388	2911571	87472	8.0	Above-average early 80's slasher	While there's nothing that particularly makes this film stand out , it's one of the better early 80's slasher flicks around , and it also has Clu Gulager and Vera Miles to add some class to it ( ? ) . The plot isn't really anything new , a bunch of sorority pledges get locked into a shopping complex to steal the security guards uniform to complete their initiation . Someone , of course , who happens to be an escaped mental patient , is in there with them though , and he happens to be someone very near & dear to one of the girls , although she doesn't know it . Seems that she ( Daphne Zuniga ) has no memories past a certain point in her life due to an accident , but her past is about the catch up to her . The acting is decent and the movie is fairly suspenseful and well done , and there's enough gore to satisfy a slasher fan . , a decent little horror flick with some good twists .
504082	2911571	65669	8.0	Lovecraft drops acid	First off , I love the opening credits of this film , with the stylized animation and the music . As for the rest of this , well , it is beautifully filmed , for the most part , with wonderful sets and yes , somewhat of a creepy story , tempered by Dean Stockwell's somewhat hammy performance as Wilbur Whately . Some " dream sequences " ( as dreamed by the still-lovely Sandra Dee ) are kind of silly , with people in makeup , who actually look fairly sinister but on the other hand they look like a bunch of hippies who ate acid for breakfast . But in the Whately house , there is a room that houses a secret , and I have to say when that door is opened that it may actually provide one of the better depictions of one of Lovecraft's " unspeakable , unnameable , un-whateverable " creatures than any other film that I've seen . Lots of color reversals and busy movement , as in , maybe , tentacles ? I've read a lot of Lovecraft in my time and haven't seen a film yet that " accurately " portrays any of his " monsters " very well , except for perhaps this film . A lot of what one sees after that as this " thing " moves about the countryside are nothing more than color reversals and nothing great , though . I've seen this film only twice now but I like it a lot , despite Stockwell's somewhat goofy performance as a low-key but " sinister " Wilbur . If you're a Lovecraft fan & you've not seen this yet it's worth checking out . A classic 70's film . .
505219	2911571	95941	8.0	dark humor and gore galore from Fulci	I'd never heard of this film before I pulled out a used copy at a used movie / music / etc . store yesterday , but saw it was Fulci & the price was right so it came home with me and I watched it last night . I'd never really thought of Fulci as having much of a sense of humor , but if he did it's certainly in this one , and it's not exactly light-hearted giggles , but it is fairly funny in spots . Lester Parsons is a man who is somewhat taken with horse racing and betting in general , and he's always hurting for money because his luck stinks , but does that stop him ? Nope , he browses the " lonely hearts " column of the local newspaper and picks up on some really lovely ( gag ) women and romances them and kills them and then squanders their money stupidly on betting , and then the cycle begins again . He manages to find some real babes too , one has excessive facial hair , and another has some kind of ugly lesion or scar on her lip , yeow . But he does manage ( usually ) to drug them and then dismember them in his basement . Once , even , with a chainsaw , and then he feeds the leftovers to some pigs . So you see , he's a true romantic at heart . But something else is going on too , it seems there's a sort of " copycat " killer on the loose , and his victims are the same as Lester's , but the details and facts are all mixed up . Lester even tries to find the other person , but he's not successful , and one wonders if he's not just losing his mind . If one hadn't wondered that when he started chain-sawing the first victim . Overall this is a pretty decent flick , if a few plot holes here and there , and by no means is this the worst that Fulci ever put out . I found it to be a decent mix of dark humor and horror , and it gets in my book .
504818	2911571	420251	8.0	pretty disturbing stuff	Three . . . . Extremes has some pretty disturbing stuff in it for your viewing . . . pleasure . " Dumplings " is the nastiest , with a woman that seeks to regain her beauty by eating dumplings made with a special ingredient . Box , by Takashi Miike , is probably the weirdest ( big surprise , eh ? ) and the offering from Korea is probably the least effective of the three but is still OK . Box is about a woman haunted by dreams of her younger sister who died when she was a child , in an accident that she seems to have caused , but is it just a dream ? Of course if you watch " Dumplings " and you haven't got a strong resolve then you may not make it to the other two films . Overall this is a pretty sick & disturbing trio of films and it will stick with you long afterward . Recommended for fans of Asian Cinema but bring a strong stomach & sense of adventure . .
505258	2911571	182996	8.0	cheesy but rather fun favorite of mine , now on DV	Despite what doesn't show on IMDb , " Don't Go In The Woods " ( Alone ) has just been released on DVD . This has been a favorite of mine for years and oddly enough the DVD box notes say that it was intended as a comedy ? Hmm , well , I guess you'd have to be in the right frame of mind ( as in , wasted ? ) to think that , but I dunno , maybe on some levels it does work as sort of a twisted comedy . Lovely Utah settings , nasty thing in the woods killing folks , I mean , nothing spectacularly different about this , really , but to me it's always had a sort of appeal that is hard to explain . The nasty thing in the woods is some crazy man who shops at the local " Hills Have Eyes " boutique for his ensembles , and also chases folks through the woods and hacks them to bits and takes them back to his place to hang out ( literally ) . Of course , sooner or later , someone has to escape this dude and give this a sort of happy ending , except for the hint at the end that all could NOT be well . . . . . it's kind of late for a sequel to this , though , isn't it ? Ha , in the movie industry ? Yeah right . One note though : The box on my Vestron VHS tape says it's 88 minutes , the box on Code Red says : approx . 83 minutes . . . . ? ? ! ! I don't know if there's anything missing or not , or if someone just can't count , but the DVD sure looks good . , hey , it's not for everyone .
504722	2911571	369994	8.0	Maybe best enjoyed by those who didn't follow the TV show ?	Back in the olden days when I had cable , I watched this show a few times and while it was kind of interesting , I never followed it faithfully so I guess I didn't really get what was going on . However , for some reason I was drawn to this movie and I wasn't disappointed . Jerri Blank ( Amy Sedaris ) is your basic loser who didn't finish high school , got into drugs and alcohol and ended up in prison . There are some truly charming prison flashbacks too , wow . . . and yuck . Anyway , upon her release she goes to her old house to find her mom has passed away , and her dad has remarried and is now in a coma , and there's a step-brother she's never met . Of course Jerri's new " mom " is less than delighted to have this misfit in their house . Jerri , of course , wants to see her dad ( Dan Hedaya ) and she seems to kindle a spark in him of life , although his doctor ( Ian Holm ) has never been able to get any response from him . This little incident wins Jerri her old room back . The next day she's ready to start back to high school to become someone " special " that her dad will appreciate and therefore lead to his recovery . Of course a fifty-something high school student is not accepted well and Jerri still acts like she's in the pen at times . This school is not exactly the premier education facility either , and the teachers and the staff have plenty of personal issues and attitude problems . Most notably Mr . Noblet , the science teacher , born-again but having a homosexual affair with the art teacher , etc . Eyow . Anyway , to obtain funding this school must do something outstanding soon , so Principal Blackman ( Onyx Blackman , that is ) can pay off his gambling debts , so a science fair comes up and Jerri and her new pals Megawatti and Tammy band together to come up with a super project although Jerri is seduced by some big jock into giving her their plans and therefore putting the science fair team into jeopardy . There's plenty of little asides and comments and things to listen for , so pay attention in this , there'll be a test later . This could have been worse , in my opinion , but I found it to be pretty funny , if not laugh out loud funny , and I guess if you didn't follow the show episode by episode then you'll probably enjoy this more because it'll be fresh to you . .
503874	2911571	71508	8.0	If only it were in 3D for home viewing	I originally saw this in 3D back in the early 80's when the 3D " Craze " had a brief resurgence . In watching this one can certainly tell it was made for 3D as innards are thrust at the screen on poles and dangle enticingly through grates . Ugh . Having said that though , it is , to me , quite a decent movie & definitely the companion-piece to " Blood For Dracula " . Udo Kier plays the Baron , & Arno Juerging once again plays his creepy little side-kick . Juerging is notable for his ability to raise one eyebrow and generally look not particularly sane . This is a rather blood-drenched Frankenstein effort and yet the " monsters " look pretty much like supermodels instead of the usual " bolt through the neck " creation . Also notable are the two creepy little kids , who are apparently the offspring of the Baron and his wife , sister , both ? Yes , I think it's both . The spy on everything they can , every chance they get , and utter hardly a word . Joe Dallesandro does what Joe Dallesandro does in most of Paul Morrisey's movies , he has sex with just about any female he can get his mitts on . This film manages to be stylish and trashy at the same time . It's kind of a black humor take-off on the Frankenstein legend rather than a serious attempt to tell another story in that vein . I enjoyed this a lot , and I feel it's well worth seeing , if you like the films of Paul Morrisey and enjoy Udo Kier ranting and raving . Pretty darn good , I must say , .
504627	2911571	1020530	8.0	" they're only children "	Imagine the kids from Alan Clarke's " Scum " , only not in prison where they belong . Throw in a dash of " Deliverance " , " Straw Dogs " , and perhaps a dash of Larry Clark's " Bully " , and that might give you an idea of the perpetrators in " Eden Lake " . Steve & Jenny have gone on holiday to Eden Lake , and Steve plans on " popping the question " to Jenny . But the tranquil setting is pretty well ruined by a group of young punks who blast rap music and behave like thugs , which is , what they are , really . Attempts by Steve to get them to turn down their music & keep their dog away serve no purpose , and the kids do finally leave , but they've set up Steve to get a flat as soon as he moves his car . After fixing that , Steve & Jenny go to town for breakfast , only to find that no one seems to think ill of the young punks that are running amok , perhaps because their waitress is one of their parents ? Eventually though , while Steve & Jenny are back at the beach , the car keys are taken , the punks take the car for a joyride , and a confrontation over the keys leads to the accidental killing of the kid's dog , after which things begin to spiral even more out of control . Steve and Jenny do manage to get away in the car but end up wrecking it because their headlamps are broken , and Steve is injured so Jenny goes for help , only to become lost & when she manages to find the car again Steve is gone because the kids have taken him and are torturing him . There's then a long cat & mouse game with the kids and Jenny , while she's trying to save Steve , who is badly wounded . Eventually Jenny thinks she's found salvation when she stumbles across a house but she wasn't expecting to encounter one of the kid's parents , who seem to be a good explanation for the kid's behavior . This is one of the better Dimension Extreme films that they've put out . It's fairly believable , it's nasty , and it's disturbing , mainly because of the ages of the kids that are doing all the nastiness . I would recommend this one to horror fans , really . Well worth seeing . .
504118	2911571	346800	8.0	always expect the unexpected with Maddin	This is autobiographical ? Not in a million years , or at least I hope not . I don't know much about Guy Maddin's personal life but I'm at least relatively sure he wasn't a murderous hairdressing hockey player with blue hands . Maddin's films are always full of surprises , and this is by far his most , uh , daring , as far as the subject matter presented . As per his usual formula , if he could be said to have one , it's filmed like it's a 1920's film with modern themes , and this takes his modern themes a bit further than any of his previous films . After a rousing hockey game with the Maroons , after which Maddin suffers from a couple head shots , he and his best friend Shaky ( who is also the police chief ? ) take his girlfriend Veronica to a beauty salon which , at night , is turned into a brothel / abortion clinic . There , the hockey teams beloved Dr . Fusi performs a procedure on Veronica after which she dies while Maddin runs off with the brothel madam's daughter , Meta . Meta wants her father's hands ( which are blue from hair dye ) transplanted on Guy , but the doctor disposes of those hands and merely paints Guy's hands blue , after which he goes on a murderous rampage because he can't control his ' new hands ' . There's a hockey player's wax museum , a sub-plot involving revenge killing , and other delightful stuff going on too . There's also a lot of male full-frontal nudity , yeow , where did THAT come from ? At any rate this is pretty damn strange but it is worthwhile to see and Maddin's genius , if that's what it is , has triumphed again . For fans of jaw-dropping weirdness . . . but perhaps not a good place to start for the uninitiated . And IS there a good place to start for those not familiar with Maddin's weird world ? Try " The Saddest Music in the World " , his most , uh , accessible film , if you like that try some of his other stuff . , wow . . . .
505078	2911571	36027	8.0	eerie , moody , dark and creepy	I'm not much for older horror films , necessarily , but I was rather pleased to finally see this classic , which was far better than I anticipated . A woman ( Frances Dee ) goes to a West Indies island , to live with the owner of a sugar plantation , Wesley Rand , and care for his invalid wife . Also on the island is the man's half-brother , Paul , and his mother , along with several servants that live at and take care of the house . As Betsy ( Dee ) settles in , she also encounters Mr . Rand's wife , who is rather spooky and glides about unseeing in a long white gown . Betsy begins to hear tales of voodoo from the house-servants and eventually takes Mrs . Rand to the " home fort " for a voodoo ritual and to see a Houngan , which is a voodoo priest . The trip through the cane fields to the home fort is one of the spookiest scenes I've ever seen in an old movie and is near-perfect . Now , a doctor on the island has told Betsy that Mrs . Rand is in her condition due to a fever which burned out portions of her spinal cord , but after the trip to the home fort Betsy is not too sure that this is the case . It seems that Mrs . Rand was a rather vain person & said and did things that may have led to what happened to her . There's also lots of familial conflicts among the Rands and a even a little time for a bit of romance . Overall , this is far better than I expected to be , and the team of Val Lewton / Jacques Tourner generated a very worthwhile film , for horror fans . .
505657	2911571	359398	8.0	Weird little British horror flick	First off , I bought this by accident , thinking of " Hellborn " which I'd read about & sounded interesting . This turned out to be a GOOD mistake though , and I really enjoyed it . First thing on the box that caught my attention was the name Dominique Pinon ( that's a guy , y'all ) . He's the strange little rubber-faced guy that's in all of Jeunet & Caro's movies ( Delicatessen , City of Lost Children , & Amelie ) . He plays a cop in this , a strange departure but interesting . Now on to the film : This is one weird little movie . It was only made last year but is low-budget and has the look to it of British films of the 80's ( for instance , XTRO came to mind ) . It's very well done and quite creepy and nightmarish . And there's an evil clown . . . . . I love evil clowns . There's a good clown too , but I think it's really the evil clown underneath , otherwise no little kids would go near it so they could be ripped to shreds . A woman who lost her child a few years prior lives a nightmare of that incident every day , and apparently is searching for the killer , still . I say apparently because despite the non-stop nightmarish flow of the film , it's also a tad bit hard to follow . But , for me , I found this to be one of those films where you just need to stop trying to figure it out and go along for the wild & creepy ride . I really liked this and I think most horror fans would , at least most horror fans that enjoy the " out of the ordinary " , a category which this fits into quite well . Recommended .
504502	2911571	451829	8.0	" Pull me "	" Funky Forest " is kind of a stream-of-consciousness pastiche of skits and strange ( and sometimes mundane ) little stories . It goes on for about two and a half hours with an intermission , too , which consists of a nearly-blank screen and background music . We have two comedians ( of sorts ) who aren't very funny , one of whom has an Emo Philips hairstyle , and their bits zip in and out of the proceedings , sometimes for only seconds at a time . Also we have The Guitar Brothers , one of whom is Tadanobu Asano , and a tubby little kid , Masao , who looks like Pugsley from the Addams Family . And there are references throughout the film to aliens from Piko-Rico ( spelling ? ) . At some times you feel there ARE aliens involved with this , because there isn't any better explanation . My favorite scenes involve a young school girl who seems what seems to be the tail of a furry creature who has gone around the corner , but when her curiosity leads her to follow , she finds it's not the tail , for it's on the wrong side , and the creature ( which appears to be a man in a furry suit ) begs her to " pull me " . And then , another man in a school kid's uniform appears & they proceed to have the girl insert some kind of tube into her navel which powers some kind of machine that eventually yields a miniature sushi chef . I also like these rather odd and creepy creatures that are treated like they're nothing unusual by the people who handle them , which apparently turn out to be organic band instruments ? They look like something right out of David Cronenberg's mind , back when he made real horror films . Also reminiscent of Cronenberg is the " After School Club " where a young girl with something like a badminton racket proceeds to swing at milk squirted from the extended nipples of a middle-aged man , which is apparently generated by squeezing a bulbous sac that extends out of his anus . And then the girl is attacked by a blood-sucker that has a little man inside . VERY weird stuff , although not presented in way in which it's made to be creepy . This will not be for everyone , especially those who think that things need to make sense and films need to be linear , for this is definitely neither of those things . It is , however , a jaw-dropping festival of weirdness & WTF film making , and is well worth seeing for the adventurous . .
505434	2911571	434179	8.0	wonderfully creepy and strange	After a man kills himself in a subway corridor by driving a knife into his eye , a camera man becomes obsessed with finding what drove this man to that act . Masuoka ( as played by Shinya Tsukamoto ) ends up wandering through the subways and finding a labyrinth of underground tunnels and passages and even the mountains of madness ? And , chained up in a little alcove , a woman . Or is it ? She looks human , she's actually kind of cute , that is , until you get a good look at her teeth . He brings her back to his apartment where he keeps her , but she won't eat , won't drink , won't speak . What he accidentally finds out is that she does drink something , and that's blood . And he couldn't have guessed that from her teeth ? He hasn't watched enough movies . Masuoka is also being followed by a man in black that knows that he has this thing in his apartment and tells him she isn't of this world . And speaking of not of this world , Masuoko is also apparently being followed by his ex-wife too , who accuses him of having their daughter hidden away from her . That part isn't exactly explained , I just sort of guessed at it . Of course now that he's found out what his little house guest likes for dinner his ex-wife isn't bothering him anymore and there's a couple of school girls gone missing . It's really hard to do this movie justice in a review , because I can't begin to describe the creepy wanderings in the subways and the glimpses of furtive creatures ( deros ? ) that seem to be down there . This has an overall feeling of dread and wrongness to it but Masuoka is only mildly concerned , maybe because he went off his medication . This should be a must-see for fans of J-horror , it's creepy and weird enough to be very appealing . .
505317	2911571	396041	8.0	Not at all what I expected . . . . . . but not at all bad	I truly was not sure what to expect of a film in which 4 actors try out for the part of Jesus , get rejected , and then go on a cross country odyssey on motorcycles . Anything this film may have borrowed from other movies along the way is lost on me , in other words it may be original in its own twisted way . Now , these four reject-Jesuses consist of a black revolutionary ( Hakim ) , a bi-sexual hippie ( Sky ) , an uptight Jewish man and a woman . As they're making their way across the country they stop for gas at a very respectable town , at least on the surface , and Sky is nailed in the restroom for soliciting a sheriff's deputy ( who in " real life " wears a straw hat better suited to a small child playing cowboy ) . The whole gang is arrested and imprisoned in the basement of the church , which is also the Sunday School room so they have nothing to do but await their sentence and color . Eventually the ' criminals ' are released to the custody of various members of the congregation , all of whom are not the fine upstanding folks they seem to be except for one , Mojack , an old black man that is the epitome of kindness . These strange adventures go on for a bit , and the gist of the whole thing is that a scheming real estate guy ( although a good Christian scheming real estate guy ) wants to frame Mojack for the trouble that has befallen their town so he can claim his valuable land . Yes , this all gets a bit complicated . But it's pretty funny most of the time , and there are little things that you barely notice while watching too , like the minister's son drinking from a jug of moonshine while sitting on Mojack's porch . Also notable is the scene where the bikers stop at a motel prior to arriving at this small town , and are menaced by Elvis impersonators . This is a wildly imaginative and weird little foray into surreal goofiness , and yes , it even has flesh eating zombies on towards the end . I wasn't sure about this when I picked it up but it's pretty bizarre and if you like that kind of stuff , it's worth seeing . Some of the satire on right wing stuff is like shooting fish in a barrel though , and those fish have already been shot plenty , but a few more plugs won't hurt ' em . .
504203	2911571	380687	8.0	far better than I expected	I had heard about this on a local radio show back around Halloween but the price tag on the new DVD kept me from picking it up , but I did find a used copy and snagged it yesterday and watched it last night and was surprised at how good it was . A young boy & his mom are on the way to pick up his sister at the ferry from the mainland and she brings a friend home ( a guy ) from school . Now the boy had been looking forward to trick or treating with his sister but the guy says he'll get a costume & go too . The little boy is obsessed with a video game called " Satan's Little Helper " ( something lots of parents would blanch at ) and convinces the boyfriend to dress up like Satan . However , the young boy has been cruising the neighborhood and finds a character already dressed like that who he takes to be the real Satan . And his behavior is rather becoming to that role as he sets up Halloween motifs in people's front yards using their dead bodies . But , this young boy is apparently so naive he can't really distinguish between his video game & reality , so it seems pretty cool to him . Of course once he brings " Satan " home with him things start to get more interesting . This is pretty well done for a low budget flick , and the Satan character is played rather well although one never knows who it is . It's been a long time since Jeff Lieberman ventured into any kind of horror picture and he still does well . At times this brings to mind older films , like " Halloween " but it doesn't linger too long on anything like that and is almost refreshingly original . , recommended .
504689	2911571	301163	8.0	Low key , low budget , and disturbing	A small group of young women in London ( I guess , it never really says , but it's SOME large British city ) band together to protect each other as they unwillingly change into flesh eaters . Now , there's always someone stalking them , and as soon as they feel they've been discovered they move on to some other abandoned and dumpy flat . Some of them look mostly normal as long as they keep their sores covered up , because at one time or another they've all been bitten by someone with this mysterious disease . One hears things in the background ( on TV , radio ) about Mad Cow Disease , and wonders if that has something to do with it , but otherwise it's not really explained . But the lack of explanation doesn't detract from the movie , really , it's just fine without it . One woman turns tricks to get money , cars , body parts , etc . One is pretty far gone and of course they have to provide her with meat . One is fairly " new " to their little group , having been bitten by an attractive young man that uses his good looks to pick up babes for lunch . Then there's the ' stalker ' , a man who is searching for his daughter , as he zeros in on likely candidates and takes them back to his torture chamber for a little talk before he puts them out of their misery . This is a low key and low budget movie , fairly disturbing for the very fact that the perpetrators in this mostly look like your average normal person , it's just their taste in food is a bit screwy . But a quick review of morality and a little reworking here and there and murder isn't a bad thing anymore . This is a Fangoria Presents , so take that for what you will , this one is above average and worth seeing , although at times a bit slow moving and talky . Creepy and nasty though . .
505431	2911571	11237	8.0	creepy German silent film	The Golem is a creature fashioned from clay to protect the Jewish Ghetto in old-time Germany , after the emperor has threatened the community's expulsion due to various trumped-up charges , although one of those charges seems to be conjurations ? No matter , they conjure him up anyway , or at least Rabbi Loew does , and he calls upon Astoroth to animate this creature with a ' magic word ' put into a Shem on the creature's chest . For a while all is well as the Rabbi uses the Golem as his servant , and then things get a bit crazy as he brings him with him to a Festival of Roses at the emperor's palace , where he , the Rabbi , has been asked to perform magic tricks . When he shows some of the history of the Jews to the attending guests they laugh and he turns the Golem loose on them , after which it seems , the Jewish community is pardoned . But wait , that's not all . Seems that Uranus is now in the House of Planets and therefore the Golem is now no longer a benign creation and he goes berserk . Of course he must be stopped , but how ? This is not quite as good as other German silent films like Nosferatu or Cabinet of Dr . Caligari , but it does rank right up there . As with most silent films the actors and actresses use exaggerated facial expressions and movements , which always tends to amuse me . Also notable is Knight Florian , the " love interest " of the Rabbi's daughter Miriam , Knight Florian seems considerably more feminine than Miriam and looks almost more pretty . But , they do apparently hop in the sack so I guess it's just the make-up . Overall this has very interesting sets and a good storyline , and will keep your interest if you have an interest in older films . The part of the Golem himself is played by one of the directors of the film and The Golem's facial expressions are downright creepy even by today's standards . I believe I read somewhere where this creature was the " inspiration " for the Frankenstein monster of later years , and I can see that in watching this . A good and interesting flick , check it out . .
505568	2911571	210302	9.0	effective and creepy art / horror from Tsukamoto	With the exception of his little knock-off horror / comedy " Hiruko The Goblin " , I have loved all films I've seen by Shinya Tsukamoto and this is probably one of his best . It takes a while to understand what's going on , but the build-up is quite good and is creepy , bordering on disturbing . A doctor and his wife are staying with his parents , and the parents are not sure about the new bride , who claims to have amnesia but may be other than what she seems . When the father passes away , there is much mourning , and then when the mother arises to use the bathroom in the middle of the night she encounters a VERY strange character that literally scares the life out of her . And then there's the kindly doctor who is puttering about the garden who suddenly is attacked and ends up at the bottom of the well , only to realize that it seems to be himself that put him there ? For he has an identical twin , it seems , and the twin has assumed his identity . Sure , there's a lot more to it than that , but you'll have to watch it to find out . Good use of eerie and unsettling music too . This is a bit more " arty " than earlier Tsukamoto films , but well worth seeing and very unsettling . Ryo as the wife Rin is quite good in her role and she seems almost " other-wordly " and to an extent , she IS from another world , of sorts . Well worth seeing for fans of creepy Asian cinema and if you've seen and liked other offerings from Tsukamoto ( like Tetsuo , Snake of June ) , you'll like this . .
504005	2911571	70531	9.0	Excellent early 70's science fiction with a creepy atmosphere	I remember this movie well from when I was young , and while I haven't seen it in at least 20 years or more in watching it again it was like I had just seen it yesterday . Two scientists go to the Arizona desert to look into unusual ant activity that has apparently been caused by solar / atmospheric disruptions and find that ants are doing things that ants have never done before , like thinking , organizing , and generally being very , very , naughty . The scientists are trying to get people out of this area because the ant activity is resulting in casualties and basically it appears that ants are preparing to rise up and take over the earth , and there seems to be very little that stops them . However , some folks scoff at the warnings and of course , get munched , so the scientists pick up a young lady to share their Geodesic dome with them . I can't tell you the whole story , really , but this has a rather creepy and desolate feel to it , it mostly takes place in the desert , and it's presented in a very plausible way , well , except for perhaps the ending , which is kind of ambiguous . This is a film that BEGS to be on DVD , and it's also rather a " thinking person's " science fiction movie too , as in , no space ships or big explosions or ray guns . Kind of invasion from right under man's noses , and a well planned one at that , that will probably chill you as you watch . , awesome .
504954	2911571	451079	9.0	Justice done to Dr . Seuss's Creations !	I got my first Dr . Seuss book ( Dr . Suess's Sleep Book ) when I was about 3 or 4 , and even then I can remember that I was drawn to the strange critters and odd buildings and contraptions , and went on to have more of his books as I grew a little older . I still have a soft spot in my heart for Dr . Seuss so I was delighted to find that " Horton Hears a Who " is a spot-on example of the RIGHT way to do Dr . Seuss . The creatures are perfect , the buildings and contraptions , well , they're exactly the way I remember and near perfect . The story is a familiar one , that is , if you grew up with Dr . Seuss . . . Horton ( voiced by Jim Carrey ) , an elephant in the jungle , finds a tiny speck which holds the entire world of The Whos . Their world is in danger but Horton manages to save them & must put them somewhere safe . However , the other creatures in the jungle , led by the Kangaroo ( voiced by Carol Burnett ! ) , don't believe Horton & want to get the clover flower , which holds the tiny speck that is the world of the Whos , away from him so life can return to " normal " . Horton can talk to one person in Whoville , the mayor ( voiced by Steve Carell ) and the mayor is kind of in the same dilemma as Horton , because nobody will believe that there's an elephant that is trying to save their world . The animation is a delight , and the story is true to the book ( if a bit drawn out at times ) . The best scene is the field of clover where Horton must search for HIS particular clover flower to find it again after it was thrown over a cliff by unbelievers . There's also a little round yellow creature that's unclassifiable as any life form known but which was apparently a big favorite with the audience . The only thing that sort of didn't set well with me was a song near the end but thankfully it was brief and done with quickly . A wonderful film that is fun for kids as well as adults , especially if the adults grew up with Dr . Seuss . I haven't seen the other " adaptations " like " Cat in the Hat " or " The Grinch " and don't want to . " Horton Hears a Who " would probably make the late Theodore Geisel ( AKA Dr . Seuss ) very proud . .
505139	2911571	21577	9.0	The age of gold ? ha . . .	I'm not sure if I'm qualified to comment on this film , being that I'm not a film student and never have been , and I'm not one that reads all kinds of things that may or not be into what I'm seeing . However , I'll give this my best shot . This is an incredibly weird film from 1930 and I loved it . It's full of black humor , and it's got some rather kinky bits that one would not expect to see in a film from that particular era , like a woman sucking on the toes of a statue ? The film begins with something like an educational film on scorpions , and then moves on from there . If you're looking for someone to tell you what this film is about , find someone else , because I couldn't honestly tell you , but personally I didn't care because I just sat back and marveled at this bizarre piece of work . It's only about an hour long but it is a wonderful way to spend an hour , but I think the last bit is something that may be offensive to some , blasphemy , I think the word is , but didn't bother me . . . , incredible for the era in which it was made .
505280	2911571	60794	9.0	One of Bava's top films	I've finally seen Kill Baby Kill in a decent format , having gotten the Anchor Bay box set of Bava's films , and the transfer is beautiful and the colors are not as washed out as the DVD I had prior , plus I can watch it in Italian with English subtitles , oh , I'm in heaven . This is a great Gothic horror flick with a doctor going to a small village to find out what's going on there . Villagers are dying mysteriously and getting buried with a silver coin inserted into their hearts . Seems that a villager was responsible for the death of a little girl many years prior and that no one would help her as she lay dying , therefore the villagers are all cursed . No one has , apparently , thought of moving to another village . Anyway the ghostly apparition of Melissa Graps appears to those who are about to die , and woe unto anyone that sees her . Erica Blanc plays Monica , a woman who used to live in that village until her parents died and she was sent away , but she has ties that she's not aware of that place her in jeopardy . And that Villa Graps , well , anyone that goes there apparently never comes back , and the countess that lives there is rather unbalanced , to say the least . Overall a cool film & very worth seeing if you never have , quite well done and definitely one of Bava's best films . .
505056	2911571	113241	9.0	low-key but high interest vampire flick , of the off-beat kind	I guess Larry Fessenden has been working in films for a while now , but I've really only seen two of his efforts , this and Wendigo , and both are good but this one ( Habit ) is , well , great , I'd say . The story of a guy that has lost his father , just broken up with his girlfriend , and meets a strange but interesting young lady at a Halloween party . Now , Anna is rather mysterious , and won't even tell Sam ( Fessenden ) what she does for a living . The relationship gets even stranger as it goes on too because while the sex is good and steamy Sam always wakes up in strange places with blood missing . Hmm . Of course , Sam begins to not feel too well , and friends are quite concerned . With good reason . This is incredibly well done , and Anna is suitably mysterious , and even appears in what seem to be dream sequences but apparently they're as real as can be . This has an overall low-key approach with an underlying menace and dread , and it's fairly creepy at times . The NYC setting works great with this too . This stands well on its own merits but would probably be a great double feature to watch with " Nadja " . I saw this once a few years ago & liked it enough to chase it down on DVD , so now after seeing it again I'm interested in looking up some of Fessenden's other work . stars , pretty damn good and highly recommended .
505060	2911571	113269	9.0	excellent old-fashioned ghost story , with an odd twist	Aidan Quinn plays David , who , as a young boy had pushed his sister while playing , and she fell & hit her head and fell into a pond . Despite David's attempt to rescue her , she drowned . Not long after David's mother took him to America & now , as an adult , he's returned to England as a university professor whose specialty is debunking " psychic phenomenon " . David receives an invitation from a woman who is plagued by ghosts , so she claims , and he decides to go visit her to investigate her claim & put her mind at ease . He is greeted at the station by one Christina Mariell , ( Kate Beckinsdale ) who drives him to Edbrook , the estate , where he also meets the woman that summoned him , Nanny Tess , who seems to be in fear all the time . David also meets Christina's odd brothers , Robert & Simon , both who seem to have more than a few toys in the attic . Says Robert , " we're all mad , you know " , and that may well be a very accurate statement . David is set on finding the source of poor Nanny Tess's fear , and it could well be Simon , who continually plays stupid jokes to scare people because he's bored . But there are things happening to David that are more than can be explained by Simon's antics . David is also plagued by images of his sister , and strange happenings within the house that may well only be in his mind . And then , the unexpected twist comes , and I did not see it coming , and it's so well done that no one may see it coming . It has something to do with a missing bit of a newspaper that David finds , but he calls his assistant back at the office to find that edition and give him details of what the article says . Just be forewarned . . . nothing is as it seems . An excellent old-fashioned ghost story , up to a point , and when the " twist " kicks in , it gets even BETTER . John Gielgud even makes a couple brief appearances as a doctor . They don't make films like this much anymore . .
505577	2911571	65744	9.0	very strange and very cool	The more I see the films of Jean Rollin the more I want , well , more . Shiver of the Vampires is probably the strangest of any films by Rollin I've seen yet and it has an " ahead of its time " rock soundtrack which is quite good too . The basic story ( and it is pretty basic ) is that a newly married couple go to visit the wife's eccentric cousins at a castle , only to find the cousins are both recently deceased . Seems they were vampire hunters and now they're vampires . But , the cousin's two strange servant-girls are still at the castle , and they welcome the young couple in to stay , and they allude to the fact that their masters are not gone , and in a way they're correct , but not in the way that the young wife hopes . Of course the young wife is an immediate target for being turned ( into a vampire , that is ) and on their first night a charming goth lesbian vampire comes out of the grandfather clock for a tryst . Beyone that , well , it's kind of standard , plot-wise , but not visually . Plenty of nudity and lots of interesting little lectures by the two cousins turned vampire , one of whom sort of resembles Joey Ramone . That is , if Joey Ramone was a French vampire . I found this to be highly entertaining and definitely very weird , and it appealed to me a lot . Don't look for lots of continuity and a neat little story that gets neatly wrapped up though , this is a Jean Rollin film and that's not generally done , it seems . Very cool stuff . .
504348	2911571	404032	9.0	Warning : This is actually an intelligent movie	Exorcism of Emily Rose is not what people think it is . I had someone I work with tell me he wouldn't see it and that's because of the word " Exorcism " which I'm sure in some people evokes thoughts of oodles of pea soup and misuse of religious items . They couldn't be more wrong . This is the story of a young girl that died because she was believed to be possessed , not mentally ill as earlier determined . This is a courtroom battle of alleged facts vs . possibilities . The man on trial is the priest that told Emily to stop taking her medication because faith was the only thing that would get her through this ordeal . The opposing view is that the priest was responsible for her death because she had an alleged mental condition ( which in this case seems rather sketchy ) and that discontinuing her medication led to her death . In other words , this is a difficult case . This is quite an intelligent film , actually , and quite well acted . Not the barf-fest that some folks seem to think it to be , although there are a few harrowing and somewhat disturbing moments as flashbacks show Emily in the grip of , well , whatever she was in the grip of . If you don't care for lawyers you'll definitely not care for Campbell Scott or the head of the law firm that the defense lawyer works for , because they're about as slimy as you can get while dressed in a nice suit . Overall though this is an excellent movie which portrays a battle of beliefs , not a gory vomit-filled scare fest . Well worth seeing if you can open your mind long enough to pay for your ticket , enter the theater , and sit down . stars .
504757	2911571	443453	9.0	an equal opportunity offender	I read something about this that it was anti-Semetic , but I wonder if the person that wrote that knows that Cohen himself is Jewish ? That aside , this film doesn't portray Jews in a positive manner , but then again neither does it portray Americans , Pentacostals , Kazakhs , women , gays , and many other folks in a positive manner either . It's funny , you'll laugh , get over it and don't take yourselves or life so seriously , OK ? Borat is a Kazakh TV news reporter or something , and is assigned to go to America and while there he discovers Baywatch and someone named CJ ( who is , of course , Pamela Anderson ) . And his assignment becomes a quest to go find her , making many interesting contacts along the way . Some of the dialog is time released , I'd say , because it takes a moment to realize what he's said before you're about to split your sides with laughter . There are some things that don't work as well and a naked chase through a hotel by Borat ( after his traveling partner Azamat ) after an argument is funny but rather disgusting . The " naive travelers " and culture clash thing is played to the hilt at most times & small wonder the people of Kazakhstan are not happy about this film . At some point Borat and Azamat split up and Borat does get to California and does get to see Pamela Anderson , but the result is nothing like he's planned . But this all ends up with a fairly sweet , if twisted , ending . Overall this was pretty damn funny and most parts fare well , making this a side-splitting flick . .
505130	2911571	66563	9.0	for 1970 , this kicks butt	I have no idea how this film was received upon release but it's a dark dark comedy , with plenty of bad words and plenty of controversial subjects , in other words , it's pretty offensive , and I loved it . George Segal stars as a lawyer with a senile mother ( Ruth Gordon ) who has apparently managed to scare away all nurses and housekeepers in NYC . The latest attempt at a care-giver is a young lady ( Trish Van Devere ) who Segal fell in love with at first sight but momma keeps getting in the way . This is full of unexpected jaw-dropping lines and situations and is basically a rollicking romp through the depths of bad taste . Ruth Gordon is excellent as always as the senile mother who is always wondering where Poppa is ( he's been dead for years ) . Now THIS is a comedy , perhaps more along the lines of a John Waters comedy but still probably a big chance in Hollywood 36 years ago . Check it out , well worth seeing . .
504263	2911571	40522	9.0	desperation & hope	In post-WW2 Italy , a man gets a job ( which are scarce ) and to do his job , he needs a bicycle , which he has pawned , so his wife sells their sheets to get the money to get the bicycle out of hock . With the new job , the man is thinking of how much money he will make and how much better his family will live , until when he's working , his bicycle is stolen . He desperately tries to get it back , but it's gone , and a group of friends and he try to look for it , but to no avail . He and his son comb all of the city looking for it , and out of sheer desperation he actually tries to steal someone else's bicycle but is caught . Because of the presence of his son , he is forgiven and doesn't go to jail , but he's back to square one with no resolution . This is a rather depressing film , or perhaps merely sad , because the state of things in Italy after the war are not good and people are trying whatever they can to survive . The hero , Ricci , is a good man , trying to do what's best for his family and yet he's tempted to do what he knows is wrong when there seems to be no other solution . This is a great film , with great acting , and well worth seeing for anyone that wants to see what desperation leads people to do . Recommended . .
504985	2911571	66993	9.0	What a whacked-out film . . . ! !	First , a word on the current " unofficial " uncut DVD available from Amazon . If you've watched Substance / Televista " gray market " stuff , then you won't mind the quality so much . It's completely watchable , and yet at times it's crisp and other times a bit murky . For the only thing currently available though , it's not bad . As for the film , oh my . Vanessa Redgrave is my favorite demented hunch-backed nun ever , and Oliver Reed gives a very powerful performance as a charismatic religious leader who is corrupted by the pleasures of the flesh , rather often too , it seems , and is brought to his downfall and execution . There is plenty of dark humor here & what seems to be typical Ken Russell dark humor & weirdness . Lots of out-of-control nuns raging about without their habits and some very strange people in general , most notably the opening scene with a bunch of men enacting the birth of Aphrodite . . . whoa . This is a very powerful & disturbing film but its also got oodles of dark humor , you know , when you can't help but laugh a bit although it's very wrong . It's unfortunate though that this has not gotten an " official " DVD release , uncut , because it's one of Russell's better films , in my opinion . .
504564	2911571	110620	9.0	one of the weirdest vampire films around	A vampire legend with a David Lynch-style twist to it sounds pretty darn good on paper and looks just as good on screen . In fact , this film is a " David Lynch Presents " and he's even got a bit part as a morgue attendant in it . Nadja is a modern day vampire living in NYC , and she " gets lonely " , so when she gets lonely she , of course , " makes friends " , in this case , Lucy ( Galaxy Craze ) . Lucy isn't taking too well to this vampire thing though and seems to be losing her marbles . Her husband , Jim , has an uncle , by the name of Van Helsing ( Peter Fonda , in probably his strangest role ever ) that he's just had to rescue from jail for staking someone through the heart . . . . . seems that he thought someone was a vampire , and since it's Nadja's father , in this case he was right . Nadja also has a brother living in Brooklyn , who wants nothing to do with her , and despite his wishes she certainly seems to want to get back together . Most of this consists of Jim & loony Uncle Van Helsing trying to get Lucy back to normal and finding who did put the whammy on her , and it's all quite strange and entertaining . This is filmed in black and white , at times starkly beautiful and at other times it looks like grainy , out-of-focus Super 8 , but it all works pretty well with the story , although I'm sure some may find it too " arty " . Not that any vampire story is " normal " but this one is far less " normal " than usual and therefore worthy of your time , if you enjoy the strange and bizarre , darkly humorous at times , and definitely if you're a David Lynch fan you'll love this , since it's kind of in his style . , HIGHLY recommended .
504571	2911571	468492	9.0	Cool horror / comedy / drama with great monster ! !	As our story begins we see a man being directed to empty chemicals down a sink . He's reluctant as they're toxic and could cause problems , but he's ordered to do it anyway so he does . Fast forward to a couple years later when two fisherman are in the Han River fishing , and one sees something odd , which he catches in a cup , but he drops it and it swims away . Fast forward to the present , where it's an idyllic day by the Han River as people are enjoying the day & buying good things to eat from a little food shack , that being run by the seemingly narcoleptic Gung-Du Park and his father . Something is in the river and everyone's attention is focused on it , but suddenly it's NOT in the river anymore , it's on land and it's moving fast , and people are running for their lives . Sound like a nice day to you ? Now , Gung-Du's daughter Hyun-Seo has just graduated to middle-school and in the rush of trying to get away , even though he was holding her hand , Gung-Du loses track of her & she's seized by this creature who takes off into the river again & seemingly swallows her . All the people that live or are in that particular area are evacuated & there's some talk of viruses and infections , so effectively this family is kept from looking for Hyun-Seo , but she is alive and gets hold of her cell phone & calls in the middle of the night . Of course , no one believes she's alive but her family is determined to find her no matter what the consequences . This is a well done and EXCITING monster flick , with some decent humor and great effects . The monster itself is rather amazing and there's some humor to its movements too as it swings underneath bridges like a high-wire performer . The thing is sort of like a mutated two-legged tadpole with a bit of squid and who knows what else thrown in . Very much a winner , and a good balance of various genres makes it interesting and it's NEVER boring . .
504558	2911571	108906	10.0	incredibly good Danish hospital horror / drama / comedy	I really loved " Riget " ( The Kingdom ) but one wonders if Von Trier doesn't owe a bit to David Lynch's " Twin Peaks " . It's not that it's a rip-off , by any means , but one wonders if The Kingdom would have come about had it not been for Lynch's pioneering ultra-weird TV show . The Kingdom is about a very strange hospital in Copenhagen , built where bleaching ponds used to be and there's been a lot of strange things that have happened there over the years . Now all those strange things seem to be coming to a head . Stig Helmar , a pompous Swedish doctor , has come to The Kingdom to work , but is universally hated except by his main squeeze , Rigmor . Hook is a strange character that lives in the basement & is sort of a " Robin Hood " of hospital supplies . Moosegard is sort of a Danish Leslie Nielsen but not as much of a buffoon . Sigard Drusse is an old woman whose son works in the hospital , and she repeatedly admits herself to study the hospital and the spirits that live there . Bondo is a doctor who is so interested in a dying man's cancerous liver he has it transplanted into himself . . . and so on . This is filmed in a rather creepy style that fits the material well . This is funny , creepy , and just plain weird most of the time and is a delight to watch . Followed by " Riget II " which continues the saga , and supposedly there was to be a " Riget III " but the main characters have now passed on so that's an impossibility . Well worth seeing , check it out ! .
505249	2911571	840027	10.0	nightmarish , creepy , and downright scary	First , I should mention I guess , that I have experimented with hallucinogenic drugs a few times , back in the late 70's and early 80's , but I don't take ANYTHING anymore . Now , for those of you that enjoy ingesting a few controlled substances before settling down to watch a movie , please reconsider before watching this , first of all , you don't need it , and second of all , the movie pretty much takes care of all that . Unless , of course , you don't MIND your landlord having to let the paramedics in to drag you out of the back of the closet where you've been huddling , whimpering , under a musty sleeping bag for a week . Iskanov's earlier film , " Nails " is quite good but it pales in comparison to THIS , which is a full blown nightmare on your screen , of horrifying proportions at times . I guess it has something to do with some sort of vampires that roam the earth when it rains , and perhaps they live in the telephone lines or something , or so says a telephone repair man when he comes to fix a young man's phone , and right before the repair man is drained of all life force , I guess these things were eavesdropping . We seem to have something going on at this club too , Night Club Delerium , an apt name , lots of people doing drugs and apparently doing some kind of twisted S & M stuff , including one guy beating the crap out of some woman while everyone passively watches . The central character appears to be trapped in his apartment , afraid to leave , watched by strange people from outside who are trying to get in and appear to be these " vampires " that he's heard about . There's also a couple sidelines about a drug dealer at this club and some guy that appears to be a priest but that doesn't stop him from getting all goth and going to this club to ingest some hallucinogens and join in the fun . There is plenty of VERY disturbing imagery that will probably have the squeamish or unadventurous hitting the stop button on the DVD player and moving on to something more palatable , but I watched this , gaping , from start to finish , and it's incredibly good but also incredibly disturbing . This is a man to watch , this guy , Iskanov , hard to believe this comes out of Russia too . A man with talent , for sure , very dark and disturbing but probably one of the scariest things I've seen in ages . , this is a masterpiece of horror .
504616	2911571	101700	10.0	A real feast	This is one of my favorite foreign films ever . Like " Brazil " it takes place in a " futuristic " society which looks like it takes place in the 40's . After a nuclear war a small band of people in a town survive by trading , scrounging , and eating each other . This has some absolutely wonderful performances by an excellent cast . This is a dark black comedy , which at times is whimsical , and at other times , somewhat gruesome , and sometimes both at the same time . An outsider comes to town and finds employment doing " odd jobs " for a butcher . He falls in love with the butcher's shy daughter . Little does he know that plans are being made for him that probably don't fit in with his intentions . This movie has so many little things that it must be watched more than once to catch them all . There is a sequence featuring a bicycle pump , knitting needles , a man and a woman in bed making love in a bed with squeaky springs , that is just incredibly entertaining . Another highlight is a depressed and suicidal woman who makes several unsuccessful attempts at doing herself in . And that's entertaining ? Yeah , it is , you have to SEE it . This is a totally bizarre film , equal parts light and dark , with very likeable characters and somewhat of a good nature to it despite its subject matter . Highly recommended , and if you see this and DO like it , you will want to see " City of Lost Children " and " Amelie " , which are both by the same people , also containing some of the same actors . !
505617	2911571	361596	10.0	4 more years , and WHY ?	OK , let's just start out by saying that if you voted for George W . Bush on November 2nd , you approve of all that he does and will hate this movie so you can stop reading right now . Having said that , this is a movie that anyone with an open mind should see . I'm sure Moore takes an opportunity here & there to put his own spin on things , but then again so does Bush & his administration , and probably to a much greater degree . If this movie pisses you off because you feel it paints an ugly portrait of a great man , you're already too far gone , far beyond the bend . This is food for thought , and closely examines the relationships between the Bush family & administration & the Saudis , not to mention Cheney's old company , Halliburton , which is doing quite well now , surprise surprise . It also shows poor black Americans being recruited to join the armed forces , even one guy trying to appeal to one young man by telling him that rap star Shaggy was a former Marine . It also shows the mentality of a lot of the soldiers in Iraq , not understanding , when we are there to " help " them , why they face such opposition . Yeah , imagine that . Those with blinders firmly in place will not appreciate this movie at all , and apparently are pleased with getting what they're getting because they keep doing what they're doing . This is a movie to see , if you don't like what's going on around you and would like a few insights on why things are as they are . HIGHLY RECOMMENDED . stars .
505671	2911571	367594	10.0	Absolutely wonderful	OK , you won't find many ' kids ' movies in my reviews , but I went to see this yesterday with friends and I have to give it the highest rating of pretty much any movie I've seen in a while . When Tim Burton is at his best ( which is usually ) his films are a wonder to behold , and he's truly outdone himself this time . The basic premise is similar to the 1970 film , the 5 golden tickets in the Wonka Bars which will allow 5 children to tour the factory , but for the most part the resemblance is left in the dust after that . Depp as Willie Wonka is great , he's both child-like and disturbing at once . One gets to see how he became like he is , via flashbacks , as a child with some horrible contraption on his head for his teeth ( Dad was a dentist , played by Christopher Lee , and all candy was bad ) . The children are wonderfully horrible , with the exception of Charlie , and all do a marvelous job at their roles , especially Veruka Salt . The Oompah Loompahs are outrageous , in fact there's only one Oopah Loompah , played by Deep Roy , but he's digitally cloned and most of the musical numbers in the movie are Loompah-driven , all being in matching outfits and singing songs about the downfalls of each greedy child as they happen . Watch for the " rock star " Oopmah Loompahs , it's hilarious . The sets themselves are very Tim Burton , dank , dreary , Gothic , and yet inside the factory most things are incredibly bright and colorful and dammit , just plain FUN . Like most Tim Burton films , this is for kids of ALL ages . A wonderful film , forget Tom Cruise and go see THIS . Again , , for anyone that missed that .
