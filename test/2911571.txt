504613	2911571	95734	1.0	Ptooey	Dan Haggerty has sure been in some fine movies . Elves , and this . . . and maybe some other equally fine movies . Grizzly Adams stuff , I reckon . I guess you could call this Nightmare on Elm Street meets Platoon , but that's an insult to Nightmare On Elm Street and I've never seen Platoon , but that's the first war movie that came to mind . Some Vietnam vets are having realistic dreams about their experiences during the war . They actually look rather young to have been there at all considering the war ended a good 16-17 years before this movie was made ? I found this to be a very flat movie , little in the way of excitement or scares . It does have the " Nightmare on Elm St . " thing going on though with trying to stay awake or having someone watch you so they can wake you up if the dream gets too bad . I could identify with the trying to stay awake part , I was having a lot of trouble with that myself . One absolutely ridiculous scene consists of two guys lying on a double bed in a suburban bedroom , dressed in their combat fatigues , firing their machine guns while asleep . What the hell ? Anyway , I passed this one up time after time at the " used " store , but finally broke down and got it because I was intrigued . Nothing to be intrigued about , guess I should go with my gut feelings . Ptooey .

A film could be earnest and yet not very good , and perhaps with some unintentional entertainment value ( like laughs ) . Seems like those days are gone forever as up-and-coming " directors " can turn out seemingly " serious " horror movies , like this , at the drop of a hat , and get them released on an unsuspecting public . Be warned , this is a real piece of work . Perhaps the makers of this film WERE earnest in their efforts , but the acting is terrible and the characters are unconvincing , like the tough blond police officer and the drunken retired ex-cop that team up to catch the perpetrator in this film . The story is that young kids are getting killed in grisly ways by some Leatherface-looking killer , who may be an escaped mental patient . Suspicion falls on the janitor at the high school though , mainly because he's big & weird . He plays with dolls , & " Rock-em Sock-em Robots " with kids faces taped on . He also pretends to be a rock star & sticks pins in dolls , etc . The tough and potty-mouthed police officer then eases up and teams up on the potty-mouthed ex-cop & they set out to find the killer . The red herrings in this film are practically thrown into your lap , or perhaps your face . There are some scenes in this film that make you wonder if this was intended as a horror-comedy , but it's pretty difficult to say . The film really doesn't work on either level . Overall this is generally uninvolving and it just plays on until you either finish watching it or rip it out of the player & go to bed before it's over , like I did . Maybe the killer wasn't who it seemed to be and there was some great twist to it . Can I live without knowing this ? You betcha . .
505663	2911571	280672	1.0	beating a very dead horse	Just when you thought everyone was done ripping off " Scream " , along comes Final Stab , which again proves that David DeCoteau hasn't an original idea in his head . Yet another movie populated by rich pretty-boy pretty-girl types , and the queen bitch Angela ( as she refers to herself ) has an idea for a staged bunch of murders at an old house . Only there's a reason for what she's doing and it has to do with getting back at some guy that wouldn't do her . Oh , and the murders aren't exactly being faked . The usual ' cutesy ' dialog doesn't do it for me either . As a sort of side-story , some guys that want to mess with Angela are hanging out around the house , I guess to throw more ' red herrings ' at the viewer but all they are is more fodder for the killer . There's no one in this film that the discriminating viewer will not want to see killed horribly from the get go , and you'll be rooting for the killer , whoever it is . It is , of course , supposed to be some hired actor , but after a while you know it isn't . In fact , after a while you know pretty much everything that's going on or going to happen and it all does seem to happen with little suspense or scares . Video pablum , this is , fed to the undiscriminating viewer by spoon . My advice ? Spit it out . .
504159	2911571	161634	1.0	gratuitous torture and violence with NO redeeming values	I've seen other Guinea Pig films , like Mermaid in a Manhole & He Never Dies , and while they're pretty sick , they at least have a bit of a sense of humor to them ( however dark ) . Devil's Experiment though , is nothing more than filming a bunch of punks submitting a young girl to many methods of torture and violence and there's no plot and no redeeming values to it whatsoever . It isn't remotely scary , except for perhaps the mind-set , but it's definitely disgusting and I certainly would not call it entertainment . Now , I'm not the paragon of good taste in films and I like my trash and sleaze , but this was too much for me , really . I'm all for disturbing , in fact , I seek out things that are disturbing whenever possible , but this was a bit much . The young woman is kicked , beaten , submitted to continuous noise via headphones until she drools , and then pelted with raw meat and innards and left hanging in a hammock out in the woods somewhere . If you think that sounds great , go for it , but it certainly put me off viewing any more Guinea Pig stuff . , absolutely nauseating .
504719	2911571	183072	2.0	yikes . . . .	There are some movies that are so horrific , so riveting , and so shocking , that there is almost a hypnotic effect on the viewer and they sit , transfixed , mouth hanging open , waiting to see what happens next . This is not one of those movies , but it does have a hypnotic effect , of sorts . More of a numbing effect , I think . Thankfully I was able to break through that effect and get up and stop this and put it somewhere where it could do no more harm . Imagine fans of Ed Wood and Don Dohler making a movie with carnivorous alien sock puppets and you about have it . Wooden acting at its finest , and when the sock puppet aliens feed , they flop down on top of something in the manner that Cathy ( from the comic strip " Cathy " ) throws herself on top of food to eat . . . the artist can't draw someone eating properly , and the special effects person here couldn't create aliens to look like they were feeding properly either so they are shown flopped on top of someone and afterward there is somewhat of a messy spot . Interesting because there are no visible mouths . We have two hapless boobs wandering the country in search of the Atlantic Ocean , but they had to stop at THIS place right when an alien invasion was taking place , one laments . Interesting that they're from out of state but have the same license plates as everyone else . And if I'm looking at license plates then you know how interesting and exciting this movie is . There is also a second film on this DVD called " Feeders Two : Slay Ride " and I'm wondering if I have the nerve to try to watch it . I'm thinking if it was done later than perhaps the actors and special effects folks had perfected their craft a bit and it'll be much better . I'm also thinking that life is too short to watch REALLY bad movies and that it should go into the trade-in pile unwatched . For those with a high threshold for pain . .
504583	2911571	382077	2.0	a desperate move ?	Is the " R " rating on this movie a desperate move to make folks think that it's more " meaty " than all the " PG-13 " ' horror ' movies that are coming out lately ? Well , needless to say I felt that held a bit of hope for this . Of course the previews have all the best parts and don't subject one to the reality of how truly dull this movie is . Nobody would go see it , then , duh ? My buddy & I went to see this yesterday afternoon and we were both very disappointed . There is a lot of " build up " in this movie and what is it building up to ? Who or what is Charlie ? Well , you find out who / what Charlie is , but afterward the movie just goes on and on . Robert DeNiro is totally wasted in this , he's done so many creepy movies over the years but this definitely isn't one of them . The basic storyline is a man & his daughter move upstate NY from NYC after the mother kills herself , and the daughter finds a new friend named Charlie , who seemingly lives in a cave in the woods . Strange things begin to happen around the house , and when they do it's always the fault of Charlie . This could have been a decent supernatural sort of chiller maybe , but instead the makers chose to go a different route , and they didn't pick the road less traveled . A huge disappointment , stars .
505083	2911571	171889	2.0	Tube Top Double Feature ?	Viewer Discretion Advised is now available on a DVD with " Bacon Head " from Troma . Viewer Discretion Advised is definitely the lesser of these two films but the only one on IMDb , for some reason . After about half an hour of waiting & hoping that this would get better , I stopped it and watched something else . This is a bunch of black-out sketches , none of which are very funny , and I had barely smirked once watching this . There is a government condom patrol , which was mildly amusing , a team of " PRIC's " busting into people's homes to check for proper deployment , but otherwise , bleah . The real gem on this DVD is the OTHER feature Bacon Head , which is fun , weird , funny , and has great music from the Angry Hippos ? Yes really . Viewer Discretion Advised is pretty weak though and not worth your time . .
504743	2911571	85704	2.0	Why was this ever made ?	I remember the Hudson Brothers had a TV show back in the late 70's or early 80's , and it was on Saturday mornings , but I was pretty much over watching Saturday morning TV by then so I never saw it . I found this DVD cheap at K-Mart so thought I'd give it a shot , it was cheap , after all , and I see now it wasn't released on DVD in the US , just our neighbors to the north . . . . guess it wasn't selling there either . I guess you could call the Hudson Brother's brand of comedy ' zany ' ; I don't know what else to call it but it's not ' funny ' . It consists pretty much of yelling , running around , and pratfalls . I didn't laugh once during the entire movie . This is about a lighthouse keeper Captain Howdy ( Richard Kiel ) who falls to his death at the same time the boat carrying his wife from the Lighthouse Keeper's Ladies Auxilliary meeting in Lichtenstein shows up , and she of course falls overboard and the captains mistress ends up trapped forever in the lighthouse . Fast forward 100 years later and we have the captain coming back from the sea and the mistress haunting the town of Hellview with the light from the lighthouse , turning folks into zombies . We have several weak parodies of Indiana Jones , Friday the 13th , The Exorcist , Jaws , Dracula , etc . Pretty ho-hum stuff , and the Hudson Brothers are about as bland as you can get . Maybe a 6-year old might be intrigued by this but most everyone else will find it incredibly stupid with no redeeming values . Oh , except there is a dance number with zombies on towards the end that was somewhat almost good . . . . was Michael Jackson's " Thriller " out then ? I don't remember , but if so maybe this was a parody of that and perhaps the only worthwhile thing in the whole movie . Otherwise , a stinker from start to finish . .
504685	2911571	70066	3.0	lots of skin but hard to follow and just plain dull	This is a German film from 1974 that is something to do with some women who come to a castle and beyond that , I can't really tell you their purpose or even what the purpose of the movie is . I can tell you that there's several women who also moonlight as servants at this particular castle who strip , put on body paint and gyrate to bongos like they were at the Goth Kit-Kat Klub , though , and that seems to be a good portion of the run time of this film . Yeah , there seems to be something with devil worship and vampires , and there's some girl on girl stuff , etc . , but the main focus seems to be the painted babes gyrating away in the basement . I did rather like the eye-rolling of one of the main housekeepers / devil worshipers , that lent an authenticity to the proceedings and made her even more evil-looking . Was that Wanda the Evil Lesbian ( as billed in the credits ) ? No matter . If you aren't too picky about your lesbian devil worshiping movies , you might like this , otherwise it's pretty dull stuff and I couldn't even finish it , I was so bored . .
505405	2911571	249443	3.0	" An Art Film From Hell "	The back of the box of this film has a couple quotes from reviewers and one referred to this as " An Art Film From Hell " . That of course , piqued my interest before I saw the film & now having seen it I can say that statement may be taken two ways . Obviously the way I took it , this would be a good film , but that wasn't the case and it may safely be sent back to the Hell from which it came . The look of this is pretty good , and to me there's mostly nothing wrong with the visual aspects of the film for the most part , although being a stickler for the time & place wasn't completely important , it seems , like an unfashionably modern hairstyle on one young man and cut off shorts on the gardener ? Or maybe those were breeches , I don't know . The dialog and the action , if you could call it that , is kind of numbing , though . Seems like a bunch of people that live in some island house are being systematically stalked and killed by something , or someone . One scene in which this someone appears and makes sure the baby stops cooing forever held promise for what might be to come in the rest of the film but that was pretty much the highlight . Lots of other things going on too , like guy-on-guy stuff , two women in the house having to share the stable boy , etc . All of this seems to be done in a borderline comatose state . And once you've viewed this you'll probably feel rather comatose yourself . This had a lot of promise and I might watch it again to see if I missed something but life is too short to view bad films more than once . .
503872	2911571	265870	3.0	They may have saved Hitler's brain but they rotted mine	The date on this movie is much earlier than some of the footage , unless of course the folks that made it managed to find folks that were up on all the trends of 1967 or so , years before it happened . One CID agent has hair that looks like Ringo on the cover of Sgt . Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band , and one agent ( female , that is ) has a micro-mini that would have been scandalous in 1964 , and so on . At some point we shift to a movie that seems like it was made in the 50's . This is the tale of a plot for world domination or something , spearheaded by none other than Der Fuehrer himself , who looks pretty darn majestic with his head in a pickle jar . Much of this supposedly takes place in South America ( don't bet on it ) where Hitler and his minions have been hiding out for years waiting to unleash some deadly gas on some unsuspecting little hamlet . Along comes Dr . Science and his wife , hot on the trail of his wife's father , who has been kidnapped and spirited away to this place . While there they wander into some cantina and find the wife's sister , who has also been kidnapped . First time I ever saw someone sit down on a box of glassware and break it but not get up and move . This is NOT a great movie but it's not a bad pastime if you happen to be bound and gagged and propped in front of the TV . It borders on the " so bad it's good " variety but wavers more often than not toward the " dark side " . & I'm being generous .
504852	2911571	380814	4.0	whatever happened to good movies ?	Alice lives in an isolated house in the desert and one day is bothered by a knock on her door . The lady at the door ( Rebecca ) has come to tell her she has to move because her house is being demolished . Of course Alice invites her in , gives her tea and drugs her , and ties her up and holds her hostage . While she's held hostage , Rebecca is treated to a visual depiction ( I guess ) of what goes on in Alice's twisted little brain , and it seems that Alice is tormented by people from her past , some of whom she apparently killed . But then for no apparently reason , Alice lets her hostage go and when she flees for the safety of her home she finds she's still haunted by visions of Alice and her torment . And gets sucked right back into them , despite the fact that her boyfriend has come over to comfort her . Seems that Alice's mother died by falling through a hole in the ice ( no easy task in the desert , I guess ) but then Alice's father bestowed her with wifely duties , resulting in a child , which supposedly died . Or did it ? And are Alice and Rebecca somehow connected ? You'll have to watch to find out , I'm not telling . I suffer , you suffer . This is low-budget , which does not always mean bad , but it also suffers from the director's little touches that drag it away from any attempts at borderline thrills or chills . Overall this has its moments but they're far outnumbered by its faults . The syrupy sweet ending doesn't help much either . Not even redeemed by unintentional humor . Don't bother . , it's already in the trade-in pile .
504549	2911571	95483	5.0	even though this was made in Indonesia , it screams " 80's "	I'm giving this a 5 based on its rich content of unintentional entertainment value , some of which can be attributed to " big hair " and " bad music " . Oh , and one mullet , that's important . The story . . . well , it starts out like some kind of legend of a South Seas woman who managed to kill of her lovers with a eel / dagger that she kept somewhere where an eel or dagger would fit easily . But someone manages to get the eel / dagger from here & she curses this person's ancestors , so 100 years later here's this anthropologist ( I think ) who gets this curse & all of a sudden , forget the dagger , she's armed with a machine guy . And this is one of those films where despite the fact that this woman can't be killed by gunfire , over and over again , they still continue to shoot at her . They being , the cops , etc . Of course these are special forces cops ( and for Indonesia , strangely of Western origin ) . And then there's Snake , the stoner dude with the mullet . I think he dies , at least I hope he did , I kind of forgot now that this is all over , but for a mullet , death is the only answer . As for the woman , she gets blown up , she gets shot at , and guess what ? She still keeps on coming . . . . but like with all good ( or bad ) movies , eventually they must come to an end , and I think this one could have ended because they had used up all the ammo available in Indonesia . This is one of those " can't believe I'm watching this " kind of films , stupid but actually kind of fun , if you're in the right mood . .
504360	2911571	87221	5.0	strange Canadian slasher flick	I just got this on DVD ( Substance ) and the quality is not bad , and this is the only " official " release that I'm aware of . A woman , who is unhappy with her waitress job ( and apparently life in general ) , is coaxed by a hooker friend to go with her on a " call " and make some easy money . The customer is an older man who " doesn't like to talk about his past " , and while at his big old house , the power goes out , and one of the young women , Janet , see her friend April and the man with their throats slashed , and runs for her life , only to be caught by the mysterious assailant , and to wake up in a hospital with her wrists bandaged , an apparent suicide attempt . So what really happened ? Janet is shunned by her co-workers and loses her job because they don't want the bad publicity ( and how did she get out of the hospital ? ) . Her boyfriend Dino is rather irritated with her ( but he's irritated with everything , it seems ) and yet he hooks back up with her to help solve the mystery . There's a lot of mob-type stuff going on but it's not too clear what it is , and there's also some kind of cover-up with the judge , but for what purpose , who knows . This isn't all that bad to watch , and a mystery coupled with a slasher flick isn't ALL bad , but somewhere along the line I suppose I missed the point and nothing that happened really wrapped things up for me . A rather strange film , but mostly watchable , just a bit murky overall . .
504960	2911571	95801	5.0	I was very disappointed	I have heard a lot about this film for years & I'm always up for a quirky oddball little " slice of life " film , but while this had its moments I was very disappointed with it overall . Marianne Sagebrecht plays a woman whose drunken husband left her in the middle of the desert and she happens across this little café / hotel , which makes up the whole of Bagdad . It's run by CCH Pounder , and she has a husband that's just left her , and a daughter that's always running off with truckers , bikers , etc , and a son that has a son , although he himself is not really much more than a teenager ( plus the situation is never explained ) . OK , so everyone's a bit eccentric and while that's usually fine by me it didn't work all that well here . Now , all are suspicious of Jasmine since she's a foreigner & has lederhosen hanging up in her hotel room ( she obviously grabbed the wrong suitcase ) , but as time passes she endears herself to them but really comes into her own when she learns magic tricks that start bringing in more customers . But then the sheriff deports her , but then she comes back & puts on a Vegas-style show ? Yeah , right , whatever , say I . What little the film had going for it up to that point was entirely trashed and I couldn't even finish it because I found the last part of this a little hard to swallow , watch , or listen to . I guess , of course , it's all a matter of taste but this left a bad taste in my mouth & I guess I'll be trading it in . I really wanted to like this & it sure sounded to be to my taste , but it just didn't do it for me . .
504025	2911571	290230	5.0	OK , but see the original 1980 version instead	I first saw " Lathe of Heaven " on PBS in the early 80's , the version with Bruce Davision as George Orr , and I hesitated to watch this version , because I like the other one so much . I did finally find it very cheap though , so picked it up , and while it has its good points , I was still disappointed . First off , the settings look much more like what I would expect , which is a plus . The clothing looks much more like what I would expect too , also a plus . But unfortunately , the story itself seemed to have gotten a bit " watered-down " , to where it was not as effective , and on the overall execution , the film just kind of fell flat . If you don't know the story , George Orr ( Lukas Haas ) is a disturbed young man who claims to be able to change reality with his dreams . Of course , he takes lots of drugs to dampen his ability to dream because he's a bit scared of what he can do , but he's eventually arrested for using someone else's pharmacy card & sent to a psychiatrist ( James Caan ) for " voluntary " treatment . But eventually , Caan understands what George can to & exploits him for his own gains . Meanwhile , George is busy dreaming up plagues to thin the population , etc . Lisa Bonet stars as George's case worker , and while she's OK , she doesn't give a particularly strong performance . This is not terrible , but I would recommend seeing the original instead of this . It's lower budget and ( I think ) made for TV , but still , it is a far better production that this . I can't say if the original is more true to Ursula K . Leguin's book , because I've never read it , but to me it's the ultimate version of this film . .
504350	2911571	183817	5.0	and this is all connected how ?	Our film begins with the execution of a serial killer in 1969 in the gas chamber in the good old US of A . Fast forward 19 years to ' Europe ' ( although this is a South African movie ) and this serial killer has relocated for reasons that are never revealed . But wait , you say , didn't you just mention that he was executed ? Yeah , I did , but he's the Dark Angel , or some such thing , therefore he gets around , I guess . This film isn't entirely terrible or hopeless but teeters right there on the edge . We have a bunch of young ladies that sleepwalk through their roles and while there's enough " eighties " stuff in this to be of slight interest to people who like to snicker at hairstyles and clothes ( not that the ones today are anything to be proud of ) , there's not a lot else here to be of interest . There are two girls that are always smoking but in this a mere wave of a hand is enough to dispel the smoke so that their " chaperone " doesn't get suspicious , yeah right . There's a lot of build up , for sure , lots of sinister music and sound effects like growling , baby noises , etc . When the evil entity is revealed it's your basic rubber suit with glowing red eyes , whee . I can't say I thought this was entirely terrible , there is a bit of entertainment value to be wrung out of it but perhaps not enough to see it more than once . .
503888	2911571	355295	5.0	A very sad effort from Terry Gilliam ( perhaps a minor spoiler )	I had been looking forward to seeing this for some time now and when I saw a few reviews I wondered what it really would be like , since nothing I read was positive . I have to say that having seen it now that I understand why nothing I read was positive . And I usually don't take reviews to heart , especially out of the local newspaper . One has to wonder if Gilliam is desperate for money after the failure of " The Man Who Killed Don Quixote " ( as chronicled in the DVD Lost In La Mancha ) . This film seems quite " thrown together " and while it starts out " Once upon a time " . . . . it seems to begin about the middle , as if the viewer understands some things that they could possibly begin to . The saving graces to the film are the moments in which you can pick out the actual fairy tales , like Red Riding Hood , Sleeping Beauty , Rapunzel , Hansel & Gretel , etc . , and the look of the film is good , I'm a sucker for a misty , dark forest setting . But the segments with the brothers themselves are rather jumbled and confusing and there's almost no character development so they're just kind of there , doing things . What is glaringly missing is the usual humor and cleverness that generally is present in Gilliam's films , and there's precious little here . One segment involves something that looks like the Pillsbury Doughboy meets the Tar Baby , but it's supposed to be the Gingerbread Man ? This segment is stuffed in almost as though it was an afterthought , and it just didn't work very well . I wanted very much to like this movie a lot , I've been disappointed in so many films lately but unfortunately this is just another one of them . .
504325	2911571	59364	5.0	Bargain basement Euro-spy flick is entertaining , but . . .	The DVD Box for Kommissar X proclaims that this is a " German James Bond " but it's not even in that league , really . Tony Kendall plays Joe Walker , whose true purpose is somewhat vague , and he's teamed with police captain Tom Rowland , and these two appear to be Americans somewhere on the Adriatic Sea chasing bad guys , with lots of bad women thrown in . This is kind of confusing at best , and has some laughable gadgetry and a gaggle of drugged women in black outfits and boots that are the slaves of one particular bad guy . Lots of cool scenery , cars , and women , but not a lot of plot . The opening credits state that this was filmed in Eastman Color & Ultra Scope but you wouldn't know it from the Retromedia transfer , which is actually a bit blurry at times & the color is rather washed out . This film might benefit from remastering and restoring and presentation in the original German with subtitles , but is it worth it ? Hard to say . Still though , this is entertaining in a goofy 60's kind of way and now I have two more of the series to watch . .
504337	2911571	876294	6.0	very bleak and grim	I was not too sure about this film , going into it , but while it was not terrible , it was rather bleak & grim . There's some mysterious disease spreading , but people in England have not yet been affected . But signs that this disease is arriving on their shores are starting to crop up just as a reporter & film crew go to interview a farmer who has had to destroy his chickens in a small village outside London . When the crew arrive they find the village seemingly deserted , and after poking around for a while they find that the disease has hit , and hit hard , and is bringing the dead back to life , and they're ( of course ) dining on the living . What follows this particular scenario are several different groups of people all fighting to survive in this new England . What's not clear is if they all had video cameras , or if the person with the video camera from the first lot has fallen in with them . At any rate , there's lots of " Blair Witch " shaky camera work , lots of squabbling amongst the survivors , and a twist or two . I guess this is not bad for a first film , but do not expect " George Romero " type effects . This is more about bands of people fighting for survival and trying to hook up with each other , which in some cases , is not a good idea , considering the natures of some of the survivors . This is a fairly intelligent film , more than a gore film , so that might disappoint some . It's just so bleak & grim that its overall effect is just plain depressing . .
504037	2911571	91209	6.0	21 years later I've just now seen this for the first time . . . .	For some reason The Hitcher never had my interest when it came out in the mid-80's , and I rarely missed any kind of horror film that came out back in those days . So last night I remembered that I've had the DVD sitting on my shelf for about TWO years now , and dragged it out , and watched it , and I have to say that I was not that impressed . C . Thomas Howell plays a rather bland character called Jim Halsey , that is transporting someone's car to San Diego from Chicago . He keeps referring to the car as a " drive-away " , like everyone knows what that means & nobody questions it , I'd never heard the term before . At any rate he picks up a hitch hiker in the pouring rain , telling the man ( who is of course Rutger Hauer ) that his mom told him never to do this . Of course , in this case , mom could never have been more right , because within the first few miles Hauer tells him that he'll cut off his legs , arms , and head , and so of course Jim pulls over to the side of the road & asks his rider to politely to get the hell out . He begins to then closes the door again , but not quite tightly enough & is knocked right out the door by Jim who is home free again until he sees his former passenger in another car with a man , wife , and kids , heading for the brink of hell . Of course , he finds their car later , over at the side of the road , and apparently what he sees inside doesn't sit well with him as he's suddenly vomiting by the roadside . And so begins a long , drawn out cat & mouse game between Hauer & Howell , which at times is so improbable that it's ridiculous . But this IS a movie , so it's OK , I guess . Of course , Howell has been set up , framed , made to look like HE'S the loony , while Hauer keeps to the background mostly and pops up now and again to dig Howell a deeper grave . Along the way Jim ( Howell ) picks up Jennifer Jason Leigh , a waitress at a truck stop , and she believes he's innocent and ends up coming along for the ride and becoming an accomplice of sorts . Of course , Hauer has blown away a couple cops too and every redneck with a badge and gun from miles around have all got vengeance in mind and are out to shoot first and ask questions later . Most notable is a scene where Hauer brings down a police helicopter with a hand gun , and he's not really even looking when he does it . What a guy . Anyway , Howell & Leigh hang out in some hotel to freshen up a bit and decide what they're going to do & of course Hauer appears while Howell's in the shower and Leigh is napping , and soon she's tied between two trucks in a " Perils of Pauline " sort of situation , and Hauer's still just getting warmed up . There's a rather strange " relationship " between Hauer & Howell , that's not fully defined , but is not exactly wholesome , I'd say . Of course eventually someone gets hold of this loony and he's held in custody , at least for a while . . . it's almost like Hauer is the heir-apparent to Michael Myers for longevity , but so far there's only been one sequel to this and Hauer isn't in it . And I haven't seen THAT one either . I don't know , some people apparently feel like this is a classic but I don't hold it in such high esteem . Which may be why it only took me 21 years after its release to see it . .
504257	2911571	202627	6.0	ghosts and vengeance	I guess this is the last of the " Yokai Monsters " series , and dang , if I didn't watch them out of order , oh well . This is probably the lesser of the trio , and involves a young girl seeking her father after her grandfather , with whom she lived , was murdered by thugs . The little girl must make a journey to another town where her father supposedly lives but of course she's pursued by thugs because she found a document that is supposedly valuable & they want it back . She meets up with others along the way , and is protected from the thugs by a more kindly sort of thug who apparently has a heart of gold , etc . But once she's reached the town & hotel to which she's going she finds her father has not been there for years . Of course , we have the thugs in hot pursuit & the girl is taken , and the thugs are subjected to the ghosts & monsters of a haunted forest , etc . Not much in the way of ghosts or monsters in this but it still looks great and has a decent enough story . Gone though , are all the cutesy mutated Pufnstuf-type monsters from before in favor of more ethereal-looking things . Not bad but definitely the least of the three " Yokai " movies . .
504151	2911571	122710	6.0	Less than I expected but OK	As usual the write-up on the box is far better than the actual content , but that should come as no surprise , I suppose . I didn't realize this was an American film , thought it was out of Hong Kong or something but no , the locale is southern CA . This is an odd little movie , about several different characters that cross paths here & there , some much MUCH closer than others , but overall it was a little on the bland side and just not weird enough , for me , anyway . There's a woman Katherine , that has blackouts , and in one of those moments she loses her cell phone , wallet , & pager , which are found by Trinh , a wild and crazy waitress with a blond wig and sunglasses she never removes . She then proceeds to stalk Katherine , returning her wallet but keeping her driver's license . Then there's Phil , who has this accelerated hair-growth problem that leads him to believe he's a werewolf , especially after hanging out with his sister's boyfriend who just happened to write a book on lycanthropy . Anyway , this tootles along just fine , one odd little incident after another , until confrontations occur and secrets are revealed . I was impressed that I did not figure out one of them beforehand . Anyway , this is a mostly OK quirky little film , but only that , nothing too spectacular .
504428	2911571	60980	6.0	OK spy spoof could have used a bit less crooning	The Sliencers is the first " Matt Helm " film , with Helm , of course , being played by Dean Martin , the last person in the world you'd probably choose for a " super-spy " role . This is a spoof , of course , so that part doesn't exactly matter except it's rather ridiculous to imagine Martin playing the role of someone that can take out a bunch of rival spies with some karate chops and more action-adventure type stuff , since his usual action-adventure ideas are more along the lines of sipping a drink , smoking a cigarette , and ogling women . Still , this is sort of fun , but I personally could have done without his singing , despite the fact that he only seems to be doing it in his head while thinking about various women around him . Victor Buono is excellent as a ridiculous Chinese evil guy , and I believe there's even another character in there that also played a villain on Batman too , although I couldn't tell you his name or the villain he played . Of course we have Stella Stevens back when she was young and pretty and not playing some of the old hag roles she has in the past few years . When this film concentrates on some of the action and things that are afoot it fares much better than when it focuses on Dean trying to be suave . And a super-spy with a station wagon , complete with a bar in the back seat ? I guess station wagons must have been much cooler in the 60's . I cringe to think that someone might think that this needs to be remade , but hopefully there's no plans . This isn't really bad , it's kind of fun , I just don't go for Dean Martin singing ( James Bond sure as hell never did ) spoof or not . .
504338	2911571	1219820	6.0	very strange & creepy , but the ending . . . ?	I picked this up because it looked interesting , and before I watched it I had read some very negative things about it , so I was rather reluctant to watch it then , but bravely popped it into the DVD player last night and wow . . . . what a strange and creepy film . It's definitely pretty original , and really the only thing in recent memory that I could compare it to is " Altered " , but that's only one small aspect of it . There is a group of friends , who worked for the same company , that are mysteriously dying . Part of the mystery of why they're dying is that they seem to be dying at the hands of their exact doubles . The woman who owns the company has seen her double & she knows that nothing good can come of this , especially when she hears of and sees surveillance tapes of one dead woman's double pursuing her though their office building . There's one thing common to all these dead folk : They all have a strange metal " artifact " implanted in their bodies . And this seems to have something to do with their double's ability to track them down . So naturally , the two remaining members of the group want their artifacts OUT . There's something to do with government experiments & stuff like that , which perhaps in some way explains the implants , and the whole film is rather mysterious & eerie , even after you kind of know what's supposed to be going on , because you don't know WHY . And then there's the ending . WTF ? What kind of ending is that ? A doctor , one who knows what's going on , tells the last remaining member what she's like , really , and that's it . Huh ? Very disappointing . Still though , this does get fairly high points for originality and general creepiness . Just that ending . . . . . ! .
504136	2911571	126004	6.0	Interesting but somewhat disappointing	I have been trying to get my hands on every Jean Rollin film I can find since my introduction to his works via " Night of the Hunted " a few years ago , so I was kind of excited to see something newly released that I hadn't even heard of before . Hmm , well , maybe I haven't heard of it because it's not one of his better films ? A young man & woman meet at a wedding reception , and they make a date to go bicycling , and when they go they stop at an old cemetery for a little picnic and then explore and make love down inside a tomb . . . but while they're busy there it gets dark & they get lost within the cemetery and wander endlessly while the woman seems to go insane , or maybe she was that way to begin with . The man is rather concerned about his watch & when they find themselves back at the tomb again he goes down to retrieve it , only for the woman to shut him in . There is lots of bizarre imagery in this , like the people that wander about the cemetery while it's still daylight , like a clown , for instance ? And there are some cuts to a beach where the woman finds an iron rose , washed up on the shore , and it's hard to say how this is all connected . No gore to this , no waif-like vampire babes in pastel nighties , this is more of a macabre poem put on film , and while it's not bad , I still found it somewhat disappointing . According to my Aurum book of horror this flopped upon release & I can see why . If you're a Jean Rollin fan though , you'll still want to see it , and some will obviously like it more than others . .
504372	2911571	61094	6.0	Nostaligic junk	I used to watch Thunderbirds on TV when I was a kid , and when I found the VHS of this on the " sell " table of my local video store , I snagged it . Mostly my interest in this was having just seen " Team America , World Police " but I was a little surprised that the puppets in Thunderbirds did't have visible strings , I seemed to remember they did . Anyway , this is an interesting little novelty more than anything else , it's not great but it's entertaining . The music by The Shadows is wonderful ( and to think when I watched this as a kid I'd never heard of them ) . It's interesting to watch certain scenes that are obviously real human body parts interspersed with the puppetry . To say the acting is a bit wooden would be a cheap shot , though . Anyway , I did enjoy watching this but not sure I'd watch it again anytime soon . .
504570	2911571	145091	6.0	one of the better " Mondo " films	Some of the material in these so called " Mondo " films is rather tame by today's standards , but I'm sure it was pretty strange to viewing audiences upon initial release . This particular one is narrated by George Sanders , and features such things as a secret " dueling club " in Berlin , where the object is to leave a scar on your opponent's face . It also has a lesbian nightclub in Paris , a female body builder that bends metal bars & tears a phone book in half while performing a song and dance routine , and Portuguese men hunting whales the old-fashioned way . . . with a row boat and hand-held harpoon . The big favorite here was Lapp women castrating reindeer with their teeth , and then the men of the group lassoing the object of their desire , and getting a bit rough with them , it seems , for not all of these women seem particularly willing . Were these guys not paying attention to what was happening with the reindeer in the previous scene ? Anyway , this is an entertaining , if not spectacular , " Mondo " , and worth seeing . .
504511	2911571	122037	6.0	A wonder to behold	I found this movie to be a wonder to behold , and probably for nary a reason that the makers intended . The living dead people are pretty cool as they shimmy-shimmy-co-co-bop across the screen , probably some of the most hyperactive dead folks that I've ever seen . Classic line in regard to that : " For dead people , they sure are smart " . This after they removed the distributor caps from the available transportation . At any rate , late in the movie the director of the mental institution in which this is all happening is confronted with perhaps knowing something about what might be the cause of all this activity . His reply is that " he hadn't thought about that in 20 years " . I don't know about you , but if I had shot someone after finding that they were conducting bloody experiments with mental patients in the basement and had a big pit full of the " rejects " close at hand and had walled them all up inside , I might just recall SOMETHING about it , from time to time . Jane Doe is something to behold too , she's an " amnesia " patient that claims that she had her memory surgically removed . She spends a good deal of the movie running through the halls of the asylum , clad only in undies and a loose top . Add in a nutty nun , and a munitions expert , and water tower that gets blessed so it's now full of holy water , and I'll leave the rest to your imagination . When I see films like this , I'm filled with a desire to talk to the people that created it , just to see what makes them tick . Or maybe I'd rather not know . Also , it's now available on DVD for the first time ever , uncut , uncensored , and ickier than ever . .
504587	2911571	391044	6.0	Not as bad as others say . . . .	Hey now , seems a lot of folks did not like this movie , well , let me be an exception and say I did , to an extent . This is pretty strange , as a cop wakes up in a large building , alone , comes outside to find himself , alone , and finds that virtually all of mankind has disappeared and something very strange ( I mean , besides all that ) is going on . Through flashbacks and visions , you're never really sure what's going on , although you get the impression that it's probably not particularly positive . There are angels wandering about , and if the angels in this and in " The Prophecy " are any indication of what REAL angels are like ( if there are such things ) then it's enough to make me phobic . The viewer is shown what actually happened a few times but since you don't know what's real and what's not , it's not exactly recognizable . This is a rather strange and creepy movie , and while it does have lapses in reason & a lot of times just doesn't make a whole lot of sense , it's still a good watch and I thought it was a pretty decent effort .
504534	2911571	83261	6.0	The Unseen , now on DVD ( minor spoilers )	Three female reporters are going to Solvang to report on a festival there , when they find that due to an error , they have no hotel room . So they find what they THINK is an old hotel but it turns out to be a museum , run by charming ( but loony ) Sydney Lassick . After trying to find these young ladies a place , he finally gives up with no success , but offers them a room at his home . His wife seems rather unhappy that they have guests , and there's something seemingly wrong about the whole thing , of course . One of the three girls isn't feeling well so stays behind while the others go off to report , and meets with tragedy after something attempts to drag her down the large heating duct . While in Solvang , one reporter's ( Barbara Bach ) boyfriend shows up , and she stays with him while the other returns to the house , to again meet with problems with heating ducts . Of course , eventually Bach returns to the house & by then , Lassick & his wife ( who is actually , apparently , a blood relation ) have decided that due to the demise of the other two , this one can't be let go to tell . And what exactly is it that's in the basement that's moving through the heating ducts ? Let's just say it's just ONE good reason why brothers & sisters shouldn't mate . Overall this is kind of a slow film , but it's not terrible , and has some decent atmosphere . Who better to play a charming nut-case than Sydney Lassick , too . If you like early 70's & early 80's horror then you should like this just fine . If you're looking for something intense & bloody , look elsewhere . .
504538	2911571	64101	6.0	Definitely odd , but not up to the usual Steckler " greatness "	I've been a big fan of the films of Ray Dennis Steckler ever since I saw " Incredibly Strange Creatures . . . " on TV many years ago . But this one , " Body Fever " ( AKA Super Cool ) , isn't quite up to the goofy weirdness of old . Oh , it's plenty odd , really , but it lacks the same jaw-dropping ineptitude that makes some of his older films so wonderful . Steckler plays one Charlie Smith , a private detective , and he's out to find Carrie Erskine , a woman who has made off with a drug kingpin's satchel of heroin . And to find her , he must question plenty of strange people . Of course , he does eventually find her & they run off through the landscape like they're in some romantic comedy , throwing the satchel of heroin back & forth to each other . . . which is pretty odd in itself . And , of course , the bad guys aren't just going to let them get away with taking the satchel . This is a big step forward in the progression of Steckler's films , so big , that there seems to be something missing in between . If you don't count " Sinthia , The Devil's Doll " , the film before this is " Rat Pfink A Boo Boo " which ( if you haven't seen it ) is an extreme super-hero goof / parody / something . . . and now , in Body Fever , we have drugs ( although Brandt & Steckler don't indulge ) and all manner of 60's trappings that he had avoided ( or chosen to ignore ) . I can't say I liked the change all that much , because it was sort of a loss of innocence ( or something ) that made his previous films so wonderful . I dunno , maybe I'm reading more into things than is warranted , after all , besides " Sinthia " , I haven't seen any of his OTHER films , done under aliases , and who knows what those were like . Body Fever is just OK in my book , a welcome addition to my Steckler collection but not the crown jewel by any means . .
504113	2911571	71654	6.0	must be seen to be disbelieved	William Shatner as a lady-killing gigolo ? Yep , the beloved Captain Kirk as a leisure-suited , little cigar smoking , thieving creep , I'm sure this is something he'd rather live down , but unfortunately opportunists still make it available for your viewing pleasure ( ? ) . Also co-starring in this incredible films is Harold " Odd Job " Sakata , the guy from Goldfinger with the deadly bowler hat . More about that in a minute . Matt Stone ( Shatner ) comes to a new town , seeking new women to bilk , and he hooks up with a young widow with a small girl . Now , the girl still misses her dad & isn't having anything to do with Matt , especially after she remembers him because she hitched a ride with him ? Obviously this child isn't right to begin with . At any rate she suspects Matt of wrong-doing and hides in his car when he goes to a " business meeting " with Karate Pete ( Sakata ) and then ends up chasing him ( Sakata is on foot ) through a car wash . This is probably one of the most improbable chase scenes in the history of film making , if you could actually call it a ' chase ' . At any rate Sakata is run over by the car ( after it's clean , I guess ) and then the little girl has seen about all she needs to decide that there's a big problem here , although nobody will believe her . Least of all , Ruth Roman , who plays one of her typical blowzy roles as some rich woman with loose morals . And dig her boyfriend , Clarence , he has a televangelist hairstyle to die for . At any rate this is an unintentional hoot from twisted start to twisted finish , and something Shatner probably wishes he never was involved in . It's actually pretty terrible but I watched it with morbid fascination from start to finish . , ouch .
504319	2911571	82497	6.0	The Hand , now on DVD , for all you masochists	Actually , I had never seen " The Hand " before and wasn't quite sure what to expect , but it probably wasn't this . I guess I was thinking it would be something along the lines of the cheesy " Crawling Hand " movie from the early 60's and actually , it's not too far from it , just with better production values ( I think ) and color photography . Michael Caine plays a sort-of famous cartoonist , who is more than happy to live at his New England home & do his thing , but his wife dreams of other , more new-age things she'd like to do and begs him to move back to New York City . While driving one day , there's a nasty accident in which Caine loses his drawing hand and has to learn to live all over again , and he ends up taking a teaching job in California when he can't continue on with his cartooning . His new-age wife has other ideas though & she's determined to do what she wants no matter what Caine says . So Caine takes to " interludes " with his students , from his class , and as more stress builds up there seems to be attacks taking place from Caine's severed hand , which was never found after the accident . How did it get to California ? Thumb a ride ? At any rate , one begins to wonder if it's the severed hand doing all the dirty work , or if it's something to do with Caine's new prosthetic GI Joe Kung-Fu grip hand . At any rate , things eventually come to a head with the new girlfriend , the wife , the kid , the job , the hand , etc , which all leads to a rather creepy ending . This isn't terrible , but it's not the best horror film I've ever seen . Probably one of the scariest aspects of it is Caine's hairstyle , which at many times during this movie resembles a fright wig . .
505517	2911571	269401	6.0	What the HELL is this ?	The title of the DVD on Tokyo Shock is " Japanese Hell " so it is a bit hard to find on IMDb under that name . At any rate , we have a young lady who is given a chance to take a look at Hell without dying and going there , so that she may tell others that it isn't the happening place to be . It's also a chance for her to see where she's headed if she doesn't straighten up and fly right , too . Now , she is or will be a member of the Shinrikyo Cult , you know , the folks that used Sarin gas on the subway a few years back ? That part of the movie is quite creepy , as cult members run around wearing masks of The Great Leader . Kind of Charlie Manson from the Land of the Rising Sun . Anyway , the Hell parts are quite explicit and gory but they're also kind of campy and look to be pulled off by a bunch of amateurs at times , what with demons and dragons and other creepies running about . It was nice to see the attack on the lawyers for the Shinrikyo cult though , I see contempt for lawyers is a universal thing , not just an American phenomenon . Overall though I was a little puzzled by this whole thing , as in , what the HELL am I watching ? I guess it wasn't bad but it's hard to say how it was intended to be taken . Not too seriously , I hope !
505338	2911571	63595	6.0	pretty funny for a " serious " movie	Herschell Gordon Lewis changed his pace a bit with this biker chick flick , and while it's not necessarily successful as an " action adventure " movie or a " drama " , it does provide tons of unintentional hilarity because it's just so freaking bad . It begins with a young lady driving away from her house where her mom says good bye , she's holding her proper " overnight bag " and all , just right for a visit to someone , but of course she pulls into some garage and emerges in some skimpy little outfit on a motorcycle and off she goes to find the rest of the gang . Now , the gang is called The Man Eaters and they all have these spiffy vests with a pink cat with a bow-tie on the back . Some of these ladies look a bit rough . You can tell by the plastic-tipped cigars they smoke . One , called Whitey ( I think ) is about 250 pounds and has braided blonde hair . There's a bit of role reversal as these appear to be female chauvinist pigs who treat men as though they were " slabs of meat " . Anyway , they do a lot of riding around on their motorcycles in the Florida sun , and they even have a couple of fully clothed orgies , or perhaps they're merely heavy petting sessions . The first " orgy " is accompanied by what was perhaps meant to be groovy music but sounds like it's a game show theme . There's some pretty rough language in this too , like " you know what " in reference to penis , and frequent use of the word " mother " without the usual follow-on , so these are at least well mannered scum , to a point . Anyway the girls run afoul of a guy-gang and are set up for a big battle , and that's about it . If you enjoy really trashy silly movies then look no further , if you're in the mood for something substantial and meaningful , keep looking . I found plenty to entertain in this but none of it was probably intentional . .
504640	2911571	82410	6.0	Must be seen to be believed	So this guy , Jerry Warren , who I don't think I'd ever heard of before this , must have been a disciple of Al Adamson or something . At any rate , I went into this not knowing exactly what to expect and I found this to be an film that's absolutely SO dreadfully and hideously bad that it's incredible entertainment . The basic story line is that 4 hot-air balloonists and their dog , Melvin , crash land on what they think is a deserted island , only to encounter leopard-skin bikini-clad babes that are part space alien , a mad scientist's wife ( and the mad scientist himself , holding forth from a hospital bed ) , holographic images ( well , sort of ) of John Carradine , repeating the same things over and over and cackling , a bunch of brain-dead ex-seamen who are zombie guards , two cackling old salts that do " odd jobs " and Cameron Mitchell as Jayson , who has been imprisoned for 17 years in what looks to be a building made of balsa wood from the outside . Oh , and there is a Frankenstein monster , but he's underwater for most oft he movie and doesn't show up till near the end . This lurches breathlessly from scene to scene , never stopping once to make sense , and the segues are so amazingly bad that you wonder if the disc skipped . There are an amazing array of gadgets and props to make your jaw drop , for instance , there's something called an oscillator that looks like either a small tackle box or lunch box , painted pink and balanced on one corner to spin endlessly when doing Frankensteiny things . There are all kinds of intangible things that happen , like some force that makes your hand tingle if you talk about certain things , like other places . . . ? ? ! ! And there are the zombie-dudes , who have no blood in the bodies but partake of a local narcotic , according to Mrs . Frankenstein / Von Helsing , whatever her name is . Hmm , so no blood , how does the narcotic effect them ? This is just an absolutely ridiculously bad movie , but it's vastly entertaining and fun , despite all that . I really can't say I would recommend this to anyone but if you like bad movies that provide oodles of unintentional entertainment , then this will be right up your alley .
505005	2911571	59382	6.0	Strange and goofy	This odd little trio of films by Ray Dennis Steckler ( sometimes AKA Cash Flagg ) is his tribute to the films of the Bowery Boys , transplanted to So . Cal . in the 60's with rock'n'roll and hula hoops and skateboards and such . I guess the intent was to make family-type films but these come off as The Bowery Boys on acid , really . Steckler himself does a passable Huntz Hall , and does a lot of over-exaggerated pratfalls and such . Anyway , the first two segments come off the best , The Lemon Grove Kids & The Lemon Grove Kids Meet the Green Grasshopper & The Vampire Lady from Outer Space , and those two seem to have been filmed around the same time , but the third segment , The Lemon Grove Kids go Hollywood , falls pretty flat and is the snoozer of the trio . Overall this is fairly fun , in a stoopid ( not stupid ) kind of way . The colors are vibrant and the southern California locations and " fads " of the day make for interesting watching . Steckler's real life wife , Carolyn Brandt , and his daughter , are in most of the segments . It's interesting that on this DVD ( and on Incredibly Strange Creatres . . . ) that there are interviews with Mr . Steckler & I thought I'd get some insight as to what makes him tick , but he seems disgustingly normal compared to his films and screen persona . Anyway , if you're a Steckler fan , you'll probably like this , if not , this is probably not a good place to start , but I enjoyed it .
504413	2911571	204676	6.0	David Lynch visits the Twilight Zone	I did rather enjoy the beginning and the end of this film , but there's a part in the middle where it sort of lost its mood and theme , to a point . The idea is that there's a young girl who has come to babysit for a couple , and this appears to be somewhere on another planet . She's first welcomed by " Twelvetrees " ( Reggie Bannister ) and then meets the couple who are set for an evening at a costume ball . All through the first part of the film there's ominous imagery and odd background " music " which is definitely David Lynch territory , and this is filmed in black and white and the overall look is " Twlight Zone " , complete with the young girl's dress and the appliances , etc . Then the baby wakes up and the girl goes to investigate , and tangles with that little monster , and for a while the film loses its momentum , but then gets back on track a bit later . The baby is a bit silly looking , and for me that sort of killed the mood the film had set up . Still though , it's very interesting and unlike " normal " films in just about every way imaginable . Kind of a fun little experiment , worth seeing at least once . .
505274	2911571	63090	6.0	A delightful exercise in incompetent film making	What we have here is a failure to make a good film , but it's so chock full of junk that it's quite amusing , despite itself . We have wrestling women , one of whom has a relationship with a police detective that apparently is limited to her dressing room and ring-side , we have an orangutan that mysteriously changes into some guy in a gorilla suit when it comes time to shoot it with a tranquilizer dart , we have open heart surgery that doesn't exactly appear to meet AMA standards , and we have a mad doctor out to save his son by performing this open heart surgery and replacing his heart with that of an orangutan ( or the heart of a guy dressed in a gorilla suit , one is never sure ) . The mad doctor and his assistant cruise the streets in a Rambler station wagon , which is stylin ' beyond belief . The dubbing is hideous , but considering that this is a cheapie DVD the quality of the transfer is actually quite good , if that matters at all considering the movie . This is a festival of unintentional humor , best enjoyed by folks that love this sort of thing , but if you're looking for a good movie , you've come to the wrong place . .
504431	2911571	68542	6.0	Cool to watch but hard to follow	Spaceships from a space-station have been disappearing , and where are they going ? There's something to do with a signal about Eolomea , but what IS that ? Well , it seems that Eolomea is sort of a planet , maybe , but is it real or myth ? Overall , this is a pretty cool film to watch and it has some great & interesting effects , but there's lots of flashbacks ( I guess ) so it's hard to tell in what order things are going until late in the film . One Daniel Lagny , a cosmonaut , seems to be one of the main characters , and he's living on some kind of remote outpost with " The Pilot " , an older man who has apparently some kind of connection with Oli Tal ( another professor , I guess ) and this myth of Eolomea . And there's even a broken-down robot for sort-of comic relief , a robot that is so broken-down that apparently it's lost it's " mind " . With flashbacks & some of the jumping around in the story line ( and locations ) this is rather hard to follow , and yet it's still pretty cool to watch . Reminded me a bit of " Solaris " and maybe " 2001 " but on a much smaller scale . Fun for sci-fi fans but maybe not for anyone else . .
503975	2911571	281810	7.0	a strange thriller	Here's a strange little thriller as an ex-heroin addict leaves NYC for the Cape Cod community of Atwater Commons to attend some kind of seminar on serial killer profiling ? Or something like that . Seems Atwater Commons is quite proud of their curmudgeonly resident author who wrote a book called " Dirt Boy " about a serial killer . Atwater Commons is like David Lynch's version of The Village from the 60's TV show " The Prisoner " , they have a weird radio station that doesn't extend beyond town lines and they're always up to something odd . And so is someone else as people keep turning up dead in the fashion of the killings from the book Dirt Boy . Our intrepid hero is onto the mystery and gathering clues , but little does he suspect the real truth , until he does some real digging , literally and figuratively . This is overall not a bad little mystery thriller but could have been better , obviously a lot of work went into it but it's lacking in some areas . Still though , it's not a bad little flick and worth seeing at least once . No wild special effects , no gore , a bit on the talky side , but not bad . .
504448	2911571	365478	7.0	Not exactly screaming	I am disappointed . This is nowhere near as funny or weird as I expected and I certainly would expect better from Bruce Campbell . This is a tale that takes place in Bulgaria , why there I don't know , but it does . Campbell plays an " ugly American " type that comes with his wife on a business trip . In many ways he reminds me much more of John Cleese ( it's the mustache ) than Bruce Campbell , but I would have expected better of John Cleese too . Ted Raimi pretty much gives the funnier performance here as kind of a Russian Hip-hop Huntz Hall ( and assistant to inventor Ivan Ivanov , played by an almost unrecognizable Stacey Keach ) . Anyway , Campbell runs afoul of a knife-toting Bulgarian gypsy maid who also happens to be the ex-fiancée of their ex-KGB Russian cab driver , Yegor , and gets his skull bashed in , and Yegor himself doesn't fare too good either . Along comes Pavel ( Raimi ) to collect the bodies so the good doctor can experiment and we end up with two person's brains in one person's body , and they aren't exactly compatible . Campbell finds delightfully atrocious clothing in a bin to wear and cruises around on a pink Vespa , and also engages in a bit of rehashed " Evil Dead II " shtick and he smacks himself around with his own hand . There are a few encounters with Euro-trash thugs and gypsies and the like , oh , and by the way Campbell's wife also gets experimented on and her brain ends up in the body of something like a crash-test dummy . This is mildly amusing , and mildly weird , and mildly intriguing , but certainly not screaming . For a better taste of recent Campbell goofiness that is more weird and bizarre , try Bubba Ho Tep if you haven't seen it . It's a more satisfying watch . .
504200	2911571	83739	7.0	Teenage Head ?	It's been a long time since I last saw this and I don't remember the band Teenage Head being in it , it's not quite the nihilistic sort of band I'd expect but maybe Fear wasn't available for the concert scenes ? But anyway , now Class of 1984 is available on DVD for your viewing pleasure and it's about school kids out of control , and I'm not talking just late for class . Drugs , violence , and just plain evil behavior is the rule , and the teachers carry weapons . There's even a metal detector , which they do actually have in some schools now . The idea is that a new teacher ( Perry King ) has come to teach band and immediately runs afoul of Stegman ( Vince Van Patten ) and his gang , and this leads to an ever-escalating battle that culminates with King's wife being kidnapped . Roddy McDowell plays a mild-mannered biology teacher that flips out and runs kids down on the street after his lab is broken into and his precious animals are killed . Stephan Angrim ( from Fear No Evil ) plays a drugged out punk that's part of Van Patten's gang . A decent flick , a bit over the top perhaps but it's a movie , OK ? .
505137	2911571	167752	7.0	not a bad little thriller	Juliette Lewis plays a young woman who has inherited an apartment from her aunt , a nice apartment in the requisite creepy old building with the requisite creepy old neighbors . Her boyfriend , weatherman Greg ( William Hurt ) isn't particularly happy she chose to do that instead of moving in with him , but she's pretty strong willed so she's busily moving in and setting up and figuring out that the neighbor downstairs isn't too happy with the noise she makes . For an eighty year old woman ( which is what the downstairs tenant is purported to be ) she's pretty energetic and after several shots to the kitchen floor that broke tiles , Lewis takes revenge with a punk rock exercise workout , with the speakers of her stereo face down on the floor . Of course she feels better for a while but does that stop the weirdness ? Not a bit . As the film goes on and then winds down it certainly appears that things are not what they seem , especially after Lewis climbs down to the apartment below and snoops , only to find that NO one lives there and there are diagrams of the placement of her furniture on the ceiling ? Of course things get a bit out of control at that point and she's forced to move in with Greg . Sort of a twist ending too , at least an ending with a clue that will make you wonder . Not a bad little film and worthwhile entertainment , although no great shakes . .
505430	2911571	78806	7.0	good , interesting , but probably too long and slow for many	Carrie Snodgrass plays Witchita librarian Louise , who has worked at the library for 19 years , ever since her fiancée disappeared the day of their wedding . His disappearance was never solved and Louise has led a drab life , working at the library and taking care of her invalid father ( Ray Milland ) . Now the time is coming when she's retiring from the library and she's training her replacement , a young lady who actually becomes friends with her although Louise is prepared to hate her . As the movie goes on Louise reveals things about herself and she seems to be so under her father's thumb that she never does much of anything . She does get laid with someone she picked up at the movies though . Oh , and she drinks , and apparently almost burned the library down once . Anyway , Louise sees a monkey in a pet store window and adopts it , but her father of course doesn't like it and it magically disappears . Sort of like . . . . . ? Hm , nah , couldn't happen . Anyway as the film goes along more things are revealed that I can't reveal because they'd ruin it for anyone who would like to watch this but let's just say a few questions were answered . Overall this is rather long and slow , but stick with it , if you can , it's worth it . And don't make the mistake of thinking this is a horror flick because it's not really that either . More of a character study , I guess one could call it , and a pretty decent one too . Can't really think of anything to compare it to but while it's not exactly my cup of tea I thought it was pretty well done and interesting , despite the pacing . .
504561	2911571	47136	7.0	A strange western	OK , I'm not entirely dense but if this film is meant to be some kind of allegory or satire that was all lost on me . It's a western , and a strange western , to be sure , because the main protagonists are women ( Joan Crawford & Mercedes McCambridge ) . It's all beautifully filmed in saturated colors , and has lots of famous folks in it , and is enjoyable overall , but I guess I'm just not sharp enough to read more into it than what's in front of me . Vienna ( Crawford ) has a saloon with gambling , and she's hoping for more business when the railroad comes through , but then there's this dude called The Dancing Kid ( Scott Brady ) , and his gang , who may or may not be responsible for death of the brother of Emma Small ( McCambridge ) . Of course Emma hysterically insists that they are and that Vienna is ' one of them ' . When the Dancing Kid and his gang hold up the bank while the rest of the town is at a funeral , all hell breaks loose and a posse of black-clad men , led by Emma , is after the gang and Vienna . Now I don't know much about Mercedes McCambridge except her voice was used in " The Exorcist " , but here she certainly seems rather , um , manly . At any rate the chase is on till the bitter end when the two women face off , which is rather odd for any western I've ever seen . There are a lot of familiar faces in this ; John Carradine , Sterling Hayden ( who IS Johnny Guitar but who pretty much overshadowed by Crawford ) , Royal Dano , etc . This is entertaining but I'm at a loss to read too much into it . .
505106	2911571	416315	7.0	better than average but not great	Wolf Creek begins very promisingly as 2 girls and a guy head off to spend some time at a remote reserve called Wolf Creek . . . . seemingly it's the world's largest meteor crater and it's absolutely beautiful . . . . and remote . As they go to leave , their car won't start so they're settling down for the night and along comes a friendly local who offers to help them . He tows them back to his camp and says he'll fix their car in the morning and all of a sudden it's lights out and the girls are suddenly tied up , one by herself and the other in a shed with Mick himself , who is threatening her , and this is where the movie begins to fall apart and head towards leaving a bigger meteor crater than the one they just viewed . Most of the rest of the movie involves the girls trying to escape and there's no mention from either of them about the young man they came there with , like where is he and does he need help ? He does appear again eventually but it's a long time coming with no explanation as to where he's been all this time . This was a very promising movie up to the point where you realize that something isn't right and then plunged downhill from there . Oh , it's OK , don't get me wrong , it'll probably scare the heck out of some folks , but it lost its footing and never regained it . Also somewhat chilling is when the girls realize how many other cars are stored there and there's even a nice little scrapbook of sorts , on the wall , of former victims , with their driver's licenses , other pictures , etc . Not to mention footage on the large number of video cameras also there in a big box . All the bits were here for a good movie , it's just that at a certain point it just became another " Wrong Turn " ( minus the inbreeding ) or Texas Chainsaw Massacre . And it's based on a true story too , hmm . .
505712	2911571	827498	7.0	eerie stop-motion fairy tale	Blood Tea and Red String is an eerie stop-motion animation fairy tale of the battle between aristocratic white mice and strange little forest creatures over a doll . The white mice have commissioned the strange little forest creatures ( who look rather like mice with fox ears and bird beaks ) to make a doll for them , and when the creatures have finished their creating they don't want to part with it . Of course the mice come in the dark of night & steal it , and take it back to their strange little lair , and the creatures set out in pursuit to get it back . They encounter a strange castle with a garden with killer plants , a frog that saves them , and also encounter a rather creepy spider with a human head that captures birds in its web and eats them . The mice , meanwhile , sit in their lair and drink blood tea & play cards with cards that have no values on them . This is a rather odd little film that is recommended only to fans of creepy stop-motion animation , along the lines of Jan Svankmajer or Jiri Barta , but it's definitely not in their league . A good little story , but non-narrative , and you don't really need dialog to figure it out . A good try , but could have gone a little further with the weirdness . .
504488	2911571	67169	7.0	What the hell ?	What struck me first about this is that while everyone is supposedly dressed in clothing of the 15th century , there wasn't a lot of attempt at SPEAKING as people did during that time , or attempting to hide New York accents . While the clothes are perhaps close to that time period , maybe , there's definitely some oddness about this whole proceeding and at one point Guru himself is wearing something around his neck that looks like it belongs around the bottom of a Christmas Tree . The story is that there's the priest ( named Guru , of course ) lives on this island , which is sort of a prison island , I guess , and he presides over a church called Lost Souls ? Comforting . He has a henchman named Igor that scuttles about bent over double with what looks to be a pillow on his back under his clothes for that realistic hunchback look . He also hangs out with some chick named Olga who does not really fit her part very well , since she delivers her lines like she was from Staten Island or something . I guess she's some kind of beast of vampire but the one glance I caught of her in some kind of supposed " tranformation " looked like some kind of fake buck teeth instead of vampire fangs . Now I'm not sure what the plot or point is exactly , providing that there really was one when this was made , but the gist seems to be that unwary travelers and lonely wanderers ( on an small island ? ) come to the church for aid and comfort and after a few important questions ( are you alone & does anyone know you're here ? ) the unfortunate get turned over to Olga for whatever she does with them . Of course not everyone that wanders in fits that criteria but by then I guess Guru is off his rocker so he's not being very careful anymore . This is chock full of unintentional humor , and there's plenty here to entertain , although technically this is all pretty bad , by most standards . I guess it all depends on your taste ( or lack of taste ) how much you'd like it . .
505684	2911571	94675	7.0	bleak , deadpan comedy / drama	Tasi is a miner , who is out of a job now that the mine has been closed . His father " wills " him his old Cadillac convertible , just before going into the restroom at the snack bar in which they're talking , to blow his own head off . So Tasi goes home , gathers up a few belongings , empties his savings , and hits the road . . . with the top down , in the dead of winter . Yes , he can't figure out how to put the top up . Tasi stops for a hamburger on the way and makes the mistake of flashing his wad of cash , after which he's robbed . He makes his way to a local dock where he finds work , and then meets up with a woman who has a young ( but worldly ) child , and begins a sort of romance with her . But Tasi also runs across the man who robbed him , and while in the process of beating the crap out of him to get his money back , he's arrested and sent to prison . There he gets to know his cell-mate rather well , and they engineer an escape , which eventually leads to an ambiguous but possibly happy ending . This is an interesting little comedy / drama , but it is pretty bleak , and if you can get past that , you may like it . The only other work of this director that I've seen is " Man Without A Past " thus far , although I have more to watch . His style seems to specialize in " bleak " , but that may have something to do with his films taking place in Finland , as well , which doesn't seem like the " carnival atmosphere " country , exactly . The humor is pretty deadpan but it's there , not " laugh out loud " humor , but still amusing . Worth seeing if you appreciate an odd sense of humor . .
504846	2911571	60173	7.0	From the same guy that made " The Corpse Grinders " ? ? ! !	Ted V . Mikels , director of many infamous Z-grade horror films , some of which are my ultimate favorites , actually made a movie with social consciousness ? Well , sort of , yes and no . This is more an exploitation flick than anything , but it's still an exploitation film with a message . A man in L . A . , who is a light-skinned black , goes back to Alabama to look into the reason for his daughter being killed by a bomb outside a church . The reason isn't hard to find , it's the local KKK members , and this man , Jerry , decides that he can pass for white with a few tweaks , and joins up with the Klan to infiltrate and bring it down . There are some guys from New York that have come down to stir the pot too , and try to rally the " shack town " people , but they're not having any part of it . However , Jerry manages to infiltrate the Klan and deal with the cowardly leader , who is responsible for his daughter's death , while also managing to seduce the guy's daughter . See ? It's not entirely socially conscious . This is definitely not for everyone , but it's not really all that bad . Of course , now it's rather dated ( except for the stupid attitudes that live on in some people ) . . And it is available on DVD from Blax , I got the impression it's not too easy to find though , but I got it off Amazon for fairly cheap , and the quality is fine .
505669	2911571	109838	7.0	oozing with sarcastic humor	I've only read about this until it came out on DVD so i grabbed it . This is pretty funny in a sarcastic way , as only maybe Alex Winter ( Bill & Ted's E . A . ) could do , and supposedly under all that makeup there is Keanu Reeves too . A major star ( Winter ) is hired by a toxic fertilizer manufacturer to give a better image to their product in South America , for 5 million dollars , so off he goes , and ends up in a Freak Show run by Randy Quaid where all the freaks have been created by coating them with this particular fertilizer ! Mr . T plays a bearded lady with just the right amount of delicacy , and there are lots of other goofy freaks too , like Bob Goldthwait as Sockhead , a kind of cookie monster wanna-be . This is a rather hard movie to describe but mostly everything is thrown at the viewer and it's up to you to decide how to take it . There's a few good laughs and lots of gross-outs , but the run time is kind of short . .
505232	2911571	443756	7.0	Dolly Dearest from the Land of the Rising Sun . . . .	Here's a strange little Japanese flick that combines elements of Dolls , House of Wax , Crucible of Terror , and who knows what all else . I guess it's not a ' professionally ' made film either , since it has the look of being filmed on video yet still manages to succeed rather well . It's rather gruesome it parts , yet it does have a strange sense of humor to it . Seems like there is an artist that makes dolls , very expensive dolls , that is a loner and works in his isolated studio . He has a rather unsavory assistant , who has apparently taken over a lot of his work in creating dolls but not in the way that he was originally making them . Now you can forget about credibility , since when people get water from this pond on them they turn to wax , and therefore they can be made into dolls . The assistant has also fashioned a machine that uses pond water in a more efficient way than having to chase down the victim and push them into the pond . So we have a bunch of missing girls and a bunch of dolls that seem to be created from them , although they're not apparently , entirely dead or entirely alive . This is a surreal and strange film , and at times you haven't really a clue what's going on , but it was still very interesting to watch and while it lacks high production values , it's still worthwhile to see , if you're a fan of Asian weirdness as I am .
504863	2911571	64137	7.0	weird little WWII film	I'm not sure I know how to begin to describe this but I'll give it a shot anyway . A bunch of solders , basically " walking wounded " , come across a member of the aristocracy in Belgium , out riding his horse , and are invited by the man to come stay at his castle . Little does he know what he's bringing down upon himself but the men take up residence in the castle and make it their base of operations . Their leader ( Lancaster ) takes up residence in the bed with the Count's wife , niece , whoever she is . Peter Falk takes up residence in the bakery of the nearby town , as he was a baker back in the US and the baker's husband appears to have gone away . There is a young man called Private Benjamin who is a writer who is busily taking notes to write his book called " Castle Keep " . Overall , none of these men would win any prizes in the Mental Health Sweepstakes . The dialog and scenarios are rather strange and surreal and in some ways this reminds me of " Catch 22 " but this came first and the comparison is merely that they're both strange and surreal war films . I'm not really much for war films and while this one doesn't overly seem like one until the last part it's well done and several notches to the left of " left field " . I guess this could be described as a black comedy but it's more surreal than anything , I guess . , not your basic war film , but what exactly , is hard to say .
504385	2911571	78873	7.0	Worth seeing for the Voidoids	Richard Hell & The Voidoids have always been one of my favorite bands , despite the fact that they made about 2 albums & disappeared , although Mr . Hell himself still pops up from time to time . Their music was mostly distinguished by Hell himself & guitarist Robert Quine , who lent a strange quality to their music with his off-kilter guitar twanging . At any rate , this movie is more of a love story between Billy ( Hell ) and the beautiful Nada ( Carol Bouquet ) and while it's not my usual cup of tea I still like it fine , even though it's no work of genius . This is by Ulli Lommel who did The Boogeyman , Devonsville Horror , Brainwaves , Tenderness of the Wolves , etc . Lommel himself has a part in the movie , and there's even a cameo by Andy Warhol and some freak with flashing goggles and a violin that is Warhol's assistant . There's a few live performances by the Voidoids , some wandering the streets and meeting odd people , and a few odd enough characters to make this watchable . As I said this is no work of cinematic genius but it's definitely watchable and a decent little slice of NYC back in " the day " . .
504103	2911571	296042	7.0	Icky the killer	Hey now , I will admit that I thought the blond guy on the cover was Ichi for a while but once I realized who he was I enjoyed the movie more . It seems there's an issue with a Yakuza guy that ran off with a bunch of money , and of course everyone is looking for him . And then there's Ichi , who somehow figures into all this . Ichi is this little milquetoast guy who gets violent when he gets upset . He gets REALLY violent . Anyway he's supposedly out for revenge on people that had bullied him when he was younger but it seems he's rather impressionable and that's not exactly what's going on at all . This film has some rather icky moments , as in gore galore , and there's even someone that literally splits . . . . . . . amazing . The blond gentleman pictured on the cover has a rather interesting mutilation that allows him to open his big mouth when he chooses . . . . . which is quite the ghastly effect . Overall this was a decent movie but it was a bit hard to figure out who was who for a while and in the opening the editing is quite confusing but once everything settles down a bit this becomes quite an interesting film . Miike did much better with Audition though , and I'd prefer that over this if I had to choose .
505621	2911571	311361	7.0	Low Budget Kids in the Hall stuff	This is somewhat reminiscent of the material of Kids in the Hall , although much more low-budget , and unfortunately because of the budget it isn't as outrageous as it could have been , but it's still pretty odd and entertaining . Seems as though the lesbian population of Ottawa is being decimated by Vampires , and Jesus Christ and Santos team up to save the day . That's Santos , the pudgy Mexican wrestling dude with the mask . I suppose the entire " alternative " population of Ottawa teamed up to make this movie , at least that's how it seems . But why not have priests with Mohawks , while you're busy making fun of a Savior ? The guy that plays Jesus does a good job , he's pretty deadpan and innocently naive , while still knowing plenty of outrageous Kung Fu moves to put vampires & atheists in traction . The scene at the night club is the best , Blind Jimmy Leper up on stage ( look at his teeth , ugh ) and when the little team of vampire hunters realize they're in a room full of vampires the staking begins , my favorites being the toothpick & plumber's helper . This could have been much more outrageous than it is but it's obvious that it's pretty low budget and they did pretty good despite all that . I wanted to like it a lot better than I did but it's still entertaining and I only wonder what they could have done with more money . .
505356	2911571	59727	7.0	Finally available on DVD in the U . S .	Peter Cushing stars in this Amicus film as a man who collects various arcane books , artifacts , etc . , to help him with his writing . His main interest is finding why people fear these things . He's sold a book by a man who has questionable sources ( Patrick Wymark ) about the Marquis De Sade , and is promised that Wymark will return with something more interesting . He has returned with a skull , which he claims belonged to the Marquis De Sade himself , although Cushing is not convinced & doesn't buy the thing . While shooting a game of pool with his friend and fellow collector , Christopher Lee , it's revealed that the skull DOES belong to The Marquis , since Wymark stole it from Lee . Cushing realizes that he must have it and is drawn into a bizarre , almost dream-like state after he gets his hands on it , during which state unfortunate things happen to others , for this skull has terrible powers , and is not content to stay in its display case . A decent film , really , I'd never seen the whole thing before , just a bit on TV once , a long time ago . The film has a rather dark & claustrophobic feel about it , being that it's mostly filmed inside in dark & cluttered rooms . If you're a Hammer fan or an Amicus fan , of course you'll want to get your mitts on this , but this may also appeal to fans of 60's horror too . Not particularly graphic or nasty but it does have an atmosphere of dread about it . .
505009	2911571	374718	7.0	Pretty strange , pretty nasty , pretty good	I wasn't too sure about this film going into it , despite the fact that it had Bill Moseley in it and was on the Synapse label , both of which usually mean good things . What I found was that this was a pretty strange horror flick with some very nasty moments and while it doesn't make oodles of sense , it's still well worth seeing . It begins with sort of a low-key Christmas get-together ( well , that's not the VERY beginning but what the VERY beginning has to do with anything was beyond me ) . Out of the blue , a smiling Bill Moseley shows up with a suitcase full of razor blades and proceeds to quiz the attendees about who they really hate , after which he cuts himself with razor blades for each person named . And guess what ? Those folks begin to die . Moseley's part is rather small though , but effective . The parts played by the actors are rather strange too . Two of the guys that were at the party are funeral home attendants , one of whom really looks the part . There's also their boss , who moves in across the street from a drug dealer & makes an effort to be neighborly by dropping by to let him know that he's a registered sex offender . Eek ! And then there's the girl who has come back from California to visit , who has apparently had some problems while she was out there due to the marks on her wrists . As the film rolls on and more people begin to die , two of the guys come up with a plan to get their hands on some weapons and go visit one guy's uncle ( or dad , it's hard to say , this IS Alabama , after all ) . The man ( played by Tom Towles ) is a crazed chili cook and arms collector , and of course some of these drunken and not-too-swift types shouldn't have their hands on firearms at all , as is evidenced by an accidental shooting . And , there's some kind of creature , too , who enjoys messy killings . What is it , and where did it come from ? Well , I'm sure it's something to do with Mr . Suitcase , but it's never really explained . Also of note is the scene with a garage mechanic ( wearing sunglasses ) and an ax , played in slow motion . . . . very weird and creepy . Still though , this is a weirdly enjoyable low-budget horror flick , and if you're not worried about anything making perfect sense ( it's a HORROR flick ) then you'll probably enjoy it . I'm probably not doing it justice but it is rather hard to get your brain around the proceedings at times . .
503915	2911571	215658	7.0	guess who didn't take their medication again ?	Confessions of a Psycho Cat is actually one of the better 60's exploitation flicks I've seen from Something Weird video , and this one is a take-off on " The Most Dangerous Game " , but the hunter ( huntress ? ) is an unstable woman , Virginia , who has just had a nervous breakdown so she couldn't go on safari in Africa with her brother . So , of course she does the next best thing , in picking three men who have all killed before in some manner , and stalking them in the wilds of New York City . The idea is that the hunt begins when they all received checks by courier for $100 , 000 and they don't get the money unless they survive for 24 hours . And Virginia has vowed she won't lose . There's apparently some footage inserted here of some party where young folks are groping each other which has little to do with the original story , and that tends to slow things down a bit . Virginia is rather resourceful in her attempts to lure her prey out into the open and it's apparent that there was at least some decent writing behind this film . This is kind of a fun movie & it also features Jake LaMotta ( former wrestler who was portrayed by Robert DeNiro in " Raging Bull ) as one of the three men being tracked down . We do also have Virginia's kindly but very concerned doctor who insists that she has to take her medication but his concern & intervention is pretty much too late at that point . Besides being a kind of fun movie it's also a decent print so the viewing experience is a bit more pleasant . . . in stark black and while and actually pretty well done . , fans of 60's exploitation stuff should eat this up .
504192	2911571	462485	8.0	" The chicken has declared Jihad on us all ! "	I think I've been seeing trailers for " Poultrygeist " for about a year or more now , as I do watch a lot of Troma stuff . And now , I have it on DVD , and I watched it last night . . . . and it does live up to all the hype . For those unfamiliar with the plot , it does involve the bulldozing of a Native American burial ground to make way for an American Chicken Bunker restaurant . Young Arbie , who has just discovered that his former girlfriend is now " bumping tacos " with her new love interest , marches in and demands a job there . And strange things are beginning to happen , which are , in part , because of the restaurant's location . Which of course , involves angry spirits possessing the chickens and the people that were foolish enough to take jobs at the restaurant or eat the food . As with many Troma films , the humor is a mixture of juvenile & clever , and it is pretty funny . And there are even several song and dance numbers , which are pretty well done . And there's more bodily fluids and spew and disgusting bits to satisfy even the most hard-core fan of such things . The " chicken zombies " are rather creepy and disgusting too , and you may want to hold off on snacking while watching this . So yes , it does pretty much live up to the hype , and is fun , stupid , and disgusting . Lloyd Kaufman even plays a sort of major role and even SINGS , fer chrissake . .
505085	2911571	264323	8.0	purty garsh-darn good	Remakes and " re-imaginings " of old films are pretty standard these days , and most that I've seen , with very few exceptions , pretty much stunk , but this , now , 2001 Maniacs , well , this is great ! Very impressive and very well done as far as the humor and the horror all tossed in together . Very strange too that Eli Roth chose to throw in his character ( Grim ) from Cabin Fever as a hitch hiker , along with his dog Captain Mambo . We don't have just 2 adults happening upon the sleepy town of Pleasant Valley here , we have a bunch of kids on their way to party hearty in Florida for spring break , and of course they're given the royal treatment by the townsfolk , not knowing that they're not really looked upon as anything but Yankee BBQ fixings . We have a few modern twists too , like there's a gay guy & a black guy and a Chinese girl , so things are a bit more " exotic " than in the original . Robert Englund does a remarkably low-key job as The Mayor of this fine town , and another cast member from Cabin Fever ( Deputy Winston ) shows up in this too and also plays a rather strange character . Now the story line is more or less the same , as these folks meet their maker a bit early all in the name of good fun . And this is good fun too , a very pleasant ( ? ! ) surprise , this one . Especially since it was apparently direct to video ? .
505059	2911571	409459	8.0	Interesting , dark , complex sort of " superhero " film	I knew nothing about Watchmen going in to see it , except what I'd heard briefly , about it being by the same guy that wrote the comic ( illustrated novel ? ) " V For Vendetta " , so since I liked that , I thought I might like this , and I did , quite a bit . The film begins with a rather dazzling sort of " alternative history " and we find ourselves in the year 1985 , with Richard Nixon in his third term ( yikes ! ) and with the Soviets and nuclear war much on everyone's minds . You might ask yourself which you find more terrifying . The Watchmen are sort of vigilante types , and they're real people , not necessarily people with super-powers , well , except for Dr . Manhattan , who is blue & has very strange eyes & powers that came from an accident involving some kind of radiation or something . Dr . Manhattan is also partly responsible for the US winning the Vietnam war , being that he can change his size & was pretty good at making Viet Cong explode with his mind , or something . The opening of the story is one of the Watchmen , The Comedian , getting his butt kicked by a mysterious assailant & finding himself at the bottom of the high-rise he lives in , much the worse for wear . And perhaps , other of the Watchmen are on a " list " as targets for whoever this assailant might be . Some of the Watchmen are very strange indeed , like Rorschach , who wears a face mask that always changes in uh , Rorschach-type patterns . Some of the Watchmen were protégé's of earlier versions of their lot , others are offspring of the same . Matt Frewer makes a rather small appearance as Moloch , a retired villain with rather interesting ears . OK , so I doubt I'm doing this film any justice with my rambling , but for someone who knew nothing about Watchmen going into the film , I found it rather fascinating , although toward the end I began to get a little lost as to what was going on . Still though , this is an interesting combination of " alternative history " and the superhero genre , without really being a " superhero " kind of film . . . . ordinary people with odd motivations in a world on the edge . The sets are for the most part , fantastic , and the whole film is very well done . I was impressed , and I didn't expect to be . Well worth seeing , even for the uninitiated . .
505027	2911571	78077	8.0	Interesting French Twist on the zombie thing	Two young women are on their way to their respective vacation spots on a train when they blunder into an area where people have been driven mad by something , and the people are also not looking too well , being that their skin is rupturing and pus is flowing , all bad signs . One young lady is killed when a man who is infected boards the train , and then the other young lady flees into the countryside only to find more infected people on the edge of madness . Seems as though there was some pesticide sprayed on grapes that have been made into wine , which , of course , being French people , most of them have drunk . Oops . So most of the rest of this is this one young lady fighting for her life against these plague-infected zombie things , and two men who are not affected helping her . This is rather well done and has plenty of squirmy moments , which are of course , courtesy of Jean Rollin . This isn't a slam bang action flick , it's slow at times , but well worth seeing if you like his films . .
504149	2911571	401320	8.0	Great , but why is it called . . . . . . . . ?	This is a mostly fun Czech zombie comedy , but why is it called Choking Hazard ? Not sure about that part . But , no matter , what we have here is a bunch of students of philosophy at an isolated inn to do philosophical type things and discover the meaning of life , and suddenly they're overrun by Zombie Woodsman . Woodsman ? Well , they have hats with feathers in them , therefore they must be woodsmen , if you follow the logic of the movie . I guess that's could be the Czech version of " redneck " in this country . This is goofy , weird , and bloody , and even has shades of " Orgazmo " as the students are joined by a latecomer , a Jehova's Witness porno star . This is not a top notch film , by any means , but it's fun and at least these folks have a decent idea how to make a horror comedy , unlike their counterparts in the US . If you hate subtitles then don't bother , because this is in Czech , no dubbing , but if you would like to see something different from a different country , then it's worth your time . .
504881	2911571	113276	8.0	oddball little film sucks you right in	This is nowhere as lurid as the title would have you believe , but it is an interesting little oddball film and well worth seeing . A man goes into a bar ( sorry , but that sounds like the beginning of a joke ) and sits at the bar and has a few beers , and in the bar there are only a few people , and as the man sits at the bar he suddenly pulls a gun and takes the few people in the bar hostage , except for the bartender , who gets shot right off the bat when he pulls a shotgun from under the counter . Now , this man , who is never named , is Raymond Barry ( a familiar face from many films & TV ) and he's got just the right mix of scary and friendly down quite well . Seems like he's been in prison for some time and he's not really into making a living having to use a fax or a cell phone or a beeper , in his words " it's too late for him " . So now the fun starts as The Man assembles his little group of hostages together to play a game called " Nazi Truth " , where each one must share deep dark secrets . The best deep dark secrets come from Lumpkin ( also knows as Mr . Suit ) because in his briefcase he has latex shorts and an enema bag . So he's not just some straight-laced lawyer from Connecticut , after all . Of course as the evening goes on and more is revealed about each person it gets uglier and uglier , until finally The Man ties everyone up and seemingly leaves them for dead . What I found somewhat fascinating is that Paul Williams is in this movie and plays a man with multiples sclerosis , who is in a wheelchair , and he did an excellent job in his role . . . . I guess it was seeing him look more normal that took the edge off , because otherwise he gives me the creeps . I will say that most of this takes place in one room and that it is rather talky , but don't let that put you off , it's pretty fascinating . .
505167	2911571	78763	8.0	oddly touching and quite good	A man spends two months salary to buy a Russian movie camera to take pictures of his new baby daughter but finds himself far more interested in filming other things as time goes by . He even begins a club at work and ends up being tasked to film a company celebration , after which he achieves a certain small fame . This spurs him on to film other things and escape his drab existence to the point where he's neglecting his wife and baby daughter to the point where she takes the baby and leaves . Now it seems that on occasion there have been things that he's filming that are causing problems , not that he knows , but he's exposing certain things that he didn't know about that don't set too well with his superiors . And when his zeal for film-making leads to trouble for his boss then he's forced to rethink his actions and finds himself regretting what he's doing . An interesting look at Poland and life there while it was still under communist rule . It's an oddly touching film because you want to see this man rise above his nothing life but then he realizes what's really more important . Recommended . .
505096	2911571	317042	8.0	weird , creepy , dark , and disturbing	This has been described as " Kafka-esque " but for me to judge that I'd have to be familiar with the works of Kafka , I guess . But I can say this is a pretty dark and creepy flick , with Jeremy Sisto as a computer programmer holed up in his apartment working on code and receiving lots of empty packages and drinking lots of milk , and dealing with plenty of strange neighbors . So what's going on ? Is there a computer virus that's spread to humans ? Because there's some kind of disease afoot too , there's always bodies getting carted away . And what of his neighbors ? Well one ( played by Bruce Payne ) is into S & M and porno and video games , another ( Udo Kier ) is some kind of weird inventor with a talking robot head , another is a young woman who is a nurse in a cancer ward that goes to freaky clubs at night to get her jollies , whew . Sisto keeps getting all these weird packages delivered INSIDE his apartment no matter what security measures he takes , and he keeps buying milk , and some creepy dude at his employer is on his butt about making his deadline , and things really start falling apart . Seems like perhaps there's some kind of corporate thing going on and the boxes that seem empty really AREN'T , just because you don't see anything doesn't mean there's something there , explains a friend . Definitely a creepy movie that oozes menace , and it'll make you think about what your neighbors might be up to . Unfortunately this is one of those movies where the sound mix is so low on the dialog that you have to turn it up but the sound effects ( when they kick in ) are enough to blast you through the wall , in which case your neighbors will wonder what YOU'RE up to . Still though , a good movie , very interesting and rather disturbing , well worth seeing . .
505445	2911571	69754	8.0	a good one but tough to categorize	" The Baby " stars Anjanette Comer ( " The Loved One " ) as a social worker who works her way into an assignment working with a supposedly retarded young man , known only as " Baby " , who is 20 years old and still wearing diapers . This young man is a part of the Wadsworth family , headed up by Ruth Roman & her two odd daughters . Of course the Wadsworths resent her presence because she treats Baby as though he was more intelligent than they make him out to be . She has her reasons though , which are not truly revealed until the end of the film and if you've never seen this before your jaw will most likely drop . The cover has this look as though it were a horror film , but it's really not , but it also pretty much defies pigeon-holing . It's not serious drama , it's not horror , maybe just " cult " would be fine . Anyway , it's not the best film in the world , but it is , at least , original and definitely strange . And , if you're like me , and didn't get a DVD player until just recently , well , you've missed out on the Image Entertainment release of this which is now out of print and going for far too much online . However , the good news is that there's a new release of it on a small label that goes for about five or six dollars , and after watching it the picture quality and sound are perfect . . . . however there's no menu or " special features " but it's an excellent value and an opportunity to see this twisted little flick that you might not have otherwise . .
504105	2911571	312843	8.0	Mail Me	My my my , the Japanese don't mess around when it comes to the portrayal of nasty things , and this movie is no exception . From the opening scene of 54 school girls taking a dive onto railroad tracks and the resulting blood bath , this film almost never lets up with the nasty imagery and icky things . A wave of suicides has hit the country and police are baffled as to the cause . About mid-point it seems the mystery is solved when a group takes credit for the mass suicides but by no means is this over . All the while we're treated to the innocuous pop music of Dessart ( which is spelled several different ways in the movie ) , a band of young girls with a big hit song ' Mail Me ' that may or may not figure into what's going on . Overall this is one wild ride of a film and takes everyday things and turns them into nightmares . Highly recommended and worth seeing , but bring a strong stomach with you .
505258	2911571	182996	8.0	cheesy but rather fun favorite of mine , now on DV	Despite what doesn't show on IMDb , " Don't Go In The Woods " ( Alone ) has just been released on DVD . This has been a favorite of mine for years and oddly enough the DVD box notes say that it was intended as a comedy ? Hmm , well , I guess you'd have to be in the right frame of mind ( as in , wasted ? ) to think that , but I dunno , maybe on some levels it does work as sort of a twisted comedy . Lovely Utah settings , nasty thing in the woods killing folks , I mean , nothing spectacularly different about this , really , but to me it's always had a sort of appeal that is hard to explain . The nasty thing in the woods is some crazy man who shops at the local " Hills Have Eyes " boutique for his ensembles , and also chases folks through the woods and hacks them to bits and takes them back to his place to hang out ( literally ) . Of course , sooner or later , someone has to escape this dude and give this a sort of happy ending , except for the hint at the end that all could NOT be well . . . . . it's kind of late for a sequel to this , though , isn't it ? Ha , in the movie industry ? Yeah right . One note though : The box on my Vestron VHS tape says it's 88 minutes , the box on Code Red says : approx . 83 minutes . . . . ? ? ! ! I don't know if there's anything missing or not , or if someone just can't count , but the DVD sure looks good . , hey , it's not for everyone .
503874	2911571	71508	8.0	If only it were in 3D for home viewing	I originally saw this in 3D back in the early 80's when the 3D " Craze " had a brief resurgence . In watching this one can certainly tell it was made for 3D as innards are thrust at the screen on poles and dangle enticingly through grates . Ugh . Having said that though , it is , to me , quite a decent movie & definitely the companion-piece to " Blood For Dracula " . Udo Kier plays the Baron , & Arno Juerging once again plays his creepy little side-kick . Juerging is notable for his ability to raise one eyebrow and generally look not particularly sane . This is a rather blood-drenched Frankenstein effort and yet the " monsters " look pretty much like supermodels instead of the usual " bolt through the neck " creation . Also notable are the two creepy little kids , who are apparently the offspring of the Baron and his wife , sister , both ? Yes , I think it's both . The spy on everything they can , every chance they get , and utter hardly a word . Joe Dallesandro does what Joe Dallesandro does in most of Paul Morrisey's movies , he has sex with just about any female he can get his mitts on . This film manages to be stylish and trashy at the same time . It's kind of a black humor take-off on the Frankenstein legend rather than a serious attempt to tell another story in that vein . I enjoyed this a lot , and I feel it's well worth seeing , if you like the films of Paul Morrisey and enjoy Udo Kier ranting and raving . Pretty darn good , I must say , .
504622	2911571	963194	8.0	Fun , gory , weird , but could it really be the next " Rocky Horror " ?	I got this film a couple days ago & watched it right away , and I have to say it was fun , weird , gory , and at times kind of sick , but I enjoyed it very much . But could it possibly ever become the new " Rocky Horror Picture Show " ? I'm not sure , but I think comparisons between the two seem to be mostly surface stuff and not necessarily content . Repo ! Takes place in the future , where a good portion of mankind has been wiped out by a mysterious plague . GeneCo is a company that supplies organs to afflicted humans , and helps people live , but of course there's a catch . . . . if you don't keep up with the payments on your new organs , someone that you don't want to mess with comes & removes them . There is a young girl , Shilo , who is confined to her house by her loving and ( seemingly ) kindly father , a doctor . However , little does Shilo know that dear old dad happens to have a second job as a Repo Man . Rotti Largo , the head honcho of GeneCo , has found that he doesn't have a lot of time to live , and he must decide who will take over the company when he dies . His choices are rather limited , because his offspring ( Luigi , as played by Bill Moseley , Pavi , as played by Ogre , and Amber Sweet , as played by Paris Hilton ) are a rather sorry lot , in more ways than one . There are also some deep dark secrets revealed about things from long ago , like how Shilo came to be as she is , and some of the other nasty things that folks have been up to over time . Terrance Zdunich rather steals the show as " The Gravedigger " , a Gothic-type who is busy collecting some essence from corpses to make a particularly nasty & addictive drug ( which is also , by the way , illegal ) . The music is great , and overall the film is well done and quite different fare for these days , considering that someone actually put some thought and originality into it . But could it really be the next " Rocky Horror Picture Show " , as it seems to be being hyped ? I guess only time will tell . , a must see .
505683	2911571	55505	8.0	Excellent Hammer film , now on DVD !	Taste ( or Scream ) of Fear is an excellent thriller starring Susan Strasberg as Penny , a woman confined to a wheelchair after a horse-riding accident years earlier . She's gone to visit her father and her new step-mother , and she hasn't seen her father in years . Prior to her arrival though , her father is supposedly called away on business , so Penny is stuck hanging out with step-mother Jane , who seems quite nice . Penny begins to see a lot of Bob , the chauffeur , and of course Jane doesn't approve of that , since he's not in her class Also present a lot of the time is intrusive Dr . Gerard ( Christopher Lee ) , who is concerned because Penny seems to be seeing things , like her father's dead body in the summer-house . Despite the fact that Penny has spoken to her father on the phone , she begins to think that there's something very wrong here . Bob sides with Penny and tries to help her get to the bottom of things , but unfortunately for Penny , nothing is what it seems to be , and no one is who they appear to be either . And that includes Penny . There's a twist ending to this that I didn't see coming and it's actually foreshadowed , but that all depends on how much you paid attention to the beginning of the film , I suppose . An excellent film , now available on DVD in a two-disk set with " The Gorgon " and two more . If you're a Hammer fan you'll definitely want to get your mitts on THIS one . .
505181	2911571	67361	8.0	Strange and stylish Giallo	It's rather odd to go back after all these years of seeing Fulci's later films and see his earlier ones , which were light years apart from what he did later in his life . This particular film was done around the time of his only other earlier film that I've seen ( Don't Torture a Duckling ) and is in the " thriller-mystery " style of that film , which I guess makes it a " giallo " . A woman may or may not have killed her neighbor , a hippie-type chick who was always having wild parties and orgies at her place . Perhaps it was jealousy at not being invited ? Or is something else entirely going on here ? Is it drugs , is she being set up by someone for some reason ? To be honest , I'd have to watch it again to see if I could figure out more , because I was rather lost at times , but it sure is cool to watch . I would love to see more of Fulci's earlier films , because it proves that his later stuff ( late 70's / early 80's ) was NOT what he was all about . This is well done but I'm afraid it was rather confusing to me , but I liked it anyway . .
505078	2911571	36027	8.0	eerie , moody , dark and creepy	I'm not much for older horror films , necessarily , but I was rather pleased to finally see this classic , which was far better than I anticipated . A woman ( Frances Dee ) goes to a West Indies island , to live with the owner of a sugar plantation , Wesley Rand , and care for his invalid wife . Also on the island is the man's half-brother , Paul , and his mother , along with several servants that live at and take care of the house . As Betsy ( Dee ) settles in , she also encounters Mr . Rand's wife , who is rather spooky and glides about unseeing in a long white gown . Betsy begins to hear tales of voodoo from the house-servants and eventually takes Mrs . Rand to the " home fort " for a voodoo ritual and to see a Houngan , which is a voodoo priest . The trip through the cane fields to the home fort is one of the spookiest scenes I've ever seen in an old movie and is near-perfect . Now , a doctor on the island has told Betsy that Mrs . Rand is in her condition due to a fever which burned out portions of her spinal cord , but after the trip to the home fort Betsy is not too sure that this is the case . It seems that Mrs . Rand was a rather vain person & said and did things that may have led to what happened to her . There's also lots of familial conflicts among the Rands and a even a little time for a bit of romance . Overall , this is far better than I expected to be , and the team of Val Lewton / Jacques Tourner generated a very worthwhile film , for horror fans . .
503914	2911571	67549	8.0	Love means never having to say you're sorry for stealing the last fix	I had never seen this film before , at least not much of it , and I was surprised when I got it to see it was only rated PG . Well , don't be fooled by that rating because all the glories of being a heroin addict make up for the lack of swearing and nudity , believe me . Al Pacino and Kitty Winn play a young couple thrown together by chance , and while her origins are rather vague , he's from right there in NYC , Needle Park , to be exact , and he's a junkie . Now Helen ( Winn ) eventually tries her hand at this too and finds out ( unsurprisingly ) that she can be a junkie too , and pretty soon they're experiencing all the joys of addiction : stealing , turning tricks , going to jail , etc . All the while they claim to be in love but an addict truly has only one love and it costs $80 a day . The settings are great , and well suited to this sort of movie , and Pacino as Bobby does well in his first starring role . This is not a feel-good movie and has no happy ending , but it's well worth seeing . .
504347	2911571	79641	8.0	Atmospheric and dream-like vampire movie	I much prefer the Nosferatu-type vampire instead of the Bela Lugosi style vampire , because it's more believable ( if such a thing is to be believed ) . This is an excellent reworking of Murnau's " Nosferatu " and feature Klaus Kinski as the creepy count , and he does justice to the role originally played by the rat-like Max Schreck . The story is virtually the same but of course it's all done with more modern looking settings and it's all beautifully filmed and in some parts , rather dream-like . Jonathan Harker goes to Transylvania to bring papers to Count Dracula who is interested in buying a house closer to a food supply . While there he's bitten , and while ill he still manages to return to his town , although he doesn't beat Count Dracula and his black coffins full of rats and soil . A plague runs full-on throughout the town and the townspeople are dropping like flies while Dracula roams the streets at night . Isabel Adjani plays the the wife of Jonathan and is the woman pure at heart that eventually lures Dracula to his demise . All in all , an excellent film and is available in the original German with subtitles or on the other side of the DVD dubbed in English . stars .
505444	2911571	407821	8.0	one big circle	A pretty decent and strange Korean thriller that seems to go full circle from beginning to end . This is one where you aren't sure if you're seeing a dream , reality , hallucination , etc . A man finds two people dead at an isolated cabin in a forest and chases yet another man who he finds there but never really sees his face , and this man knocks him out . . . . and as he's wandering through a tunnel trying to get help he's hit by a car and ends up in the hospital . It's at this point where I was no longer sure what exactly I was seeing anymore . Lots of poking back in the past , lots of trying to find out about this cabin , this forest , are they haunted , etc . ? A strange movie that's kind of confusing but would bear watching again to see if I could pick up more of what was going on . But it was cool to watch , whether or not I necessarily understood what was taking place . .
504097	2911571	209485	8.0	strange & chilling	Lily is a young lady about 14 who isn't well . And speaking of not well , there's her parents . Now dad has left to go somewhere , leaving mom in charge of the bed & breakfast that they run . Along comes a young man , a photographer , who thought that it would be nicer to stay at a bed & breakfast than a roadside motel . That turns out to be only in theory . Things seem OK at first until mom starts displaying tendencies towards odd behavior , and that's when the mystery of Lily begins . The young man finds her diary , and it seems like mom & dad aren't very nice to her or her uncle / friend , whomever this guy may be , named Tom . . . . now Tom , on the other hand , is VERY nice to Lily and isn't around anymore to talk about it . This is creepy and somewhat atmospheric , and chilling , because most of it is in a snowbound landscape in the middle of nowhere , something that you'd expect of Canada although at one point a license plate is shown and it's New Hampshire ( Live Free or Die ) . That in itself seems to be a bit of a statement of some kind . I will admit this is a bit slow moving at times , and in no way is there any explosions or car chases and things like that , but try to stick with it , it's chillingly creepy and weird and you may find you just like it . .
504503	2911571	66849	8.0	An inescapable feeling of dread throughout . . . . .	This was one of my favorite films when I was younger & it was on the late-night " Creature Features " circuit . I've just gotten this on DVD and I have found that it is still a fairly powerful film , to me . A young man , Ralph , uncovers the remains of something while plowing a field , and he's frightened by what he's found , so he goes to a judge who is staying nearby to tell of his findings , only to come back & have whatever it was , gone . So of course , no one believes him , but he comes back with friends , one of whom is Angel , who DOES find something but won't show anyone . And the son of the woman where the judge is staying , returns home with a new bride to be , but after she's forced to stay the night in the attic room , she goes mad because something was up there with her . And she's taken away to Bedlam . Now , the children of this village are acting more & more strangely , and beginning to disappear . Seems that Angel has something to do with this , and so does what she found in the fields . There apparently are some sort of deep-woods rituals going on to mutilate the village's children for some kind of chilling resurrection . And there is something that is causing pains in the children , and at the location of those pains , they've grown a hairy patch of " The Devil's Skin " , as the doctor says when he's trying to remove it from one young woman . This is beautifully filmed , and the children are somewhat innocent enough , but you know that they're not quite themselves and are up to no good , and there is an inescapable feeling of dread throughout this whole film . When things begin to get really out of hand , one man rides to find the judge ( Patrick Wymark ) who returns and puts things right again . Strange he didn't do that in the first place instead of returning to London , but then , he didn't at first believe what was happening , either . An excellent early 70's British horror flick , very atmospheric and creepy and well worth seeing , and gee , it's not even a Hammer production . .
504961	2911571	75656	8.0	ridiculously enjoyable junk	Don Dohler , from the same territory as John Waters , made cheesy and ridiculous science fiction except . . . . it's not really all that bad . Oh , he's still around , he still puts out some stuff but it was ever so much better back in the old days before he discovered bad CGI . Alien Factor is a tale of a spaceship that crashes in the woods near a small community that's carrying specimens from other planets for study . These are apparently not very nice specimens either and take to killing off the local population . A missing link to something I saw in Fangoria but could never find was solved in this film too , one of the pictures I remember seeing years ago was actually a still from this movie , it's the " big legged " critter , which is actually either the most clever of them all or the most silly , depending on your point of view , it looks like someone on stilts with over-developed legs . At any rate , despite the cheesiness I liked this a lot and the soundtrack is weird but interesting . The alien costumes were not very " typical " either , in fact they're rather interesting in a silly kind of way . What I watched was part of a " 2 pack " , Alien Factor on one side and " Fiend " on the other side , I can only hope the other film has the same attraction for me . The only movie I can think of that comes close to this for atmosphere & overall feel is ( Alien ) Prey , which is a British stinker , so if you liked that one you may like this too , but Alien Factor stands well on its own merits too , if you can stop laughing long enough . .
504300	2911571	75999	8.0	good Spanish horror-sleaze fest	A man and his wife , out for an drive , meet up with another couple where the man claims to know the husband ( Andres ) from school , although Andres can't recall the other man . At any rate the young couple is invited to the other couple's house to " celebrate " although to celebrate what isn't clear . Of course this other couple live in the middle of nowhere in this huge creepy house and are NOT what they seem to be at all . Strange things begin to happen , like Satanic rituals and orgies in the living room , etc . And their dog gets killed . Of course , the young couple is ready to run but their car is gone and they're in the middle of nowhere and of course , the phones don't work . All attempts at getting away and going back home seem to be foiled at every turn until the older couple is finally killed ( at least a few times ) and they make their escape back to the city and the safety of home . . . . so they hope . To say any more would be a spoiler . Overall this is pretty good , but has long stretches of gratuitous nudity which slow things down a bit , but the last half or so of the film picks up speed pretty good and is fairly exciting and disgusting . Fans of 70's Euro-Horror will like more than others , most likely . .
503964	2911571	116729	8.0	Interesting Dutch movie about a dress ?	This is an odd little Dutch movie about a dress , which seems to be the bearer of bad luck for all who come into contact with it . First a man loses his job because he doesn't agree with the choice of design ( it's a pretty blue with an odd leaf design ) . Then a woman who buys it becomes ill , and when the dress is hanging out to dry after washing ( apparently she barfed on it ) it blows away and ends up in the hands of a young woman who lives with an eccentric painter , who is then set upon by a deranged ticket taker from a train , a bus driver , and then gives up the dress to send to Africa , but it's of course snagged by someone else who cleans it up , trims it a bit , and it ends up on this young lady who also ends up on this train with the deranged ticket taker , who then stalks her to her remote home while her parents are away , etc . etc . There are some quite amusing moments to this , and at other times it's about as strange as can be . This is a dark comedy , and at times it also offers up some social commentary on the homeless and on foreigners . In some ways it reminds me of " Phantom of Liberty " or maybe " The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeosie " ( Luis Bunuel ) in its episodic style . This odd little film definitely won't be for everyone though , but it's funny and bizarre and even a bit touching at times . .
504878	2911571	75930	8.0	Yeah , sure he did , buddy . . . .	A random set of murders in NYC can only be attributed to one thing : All the assailants say that " God Told Them To " . So of course , they had to listen . Tony Lo Bianco is a good cop on the case and trying to figure out what's going on . There is a common thread in these killings and it's something to do with some guy with long blond hair and a face that nobody remembers . Being that this character is played by Richard Lynch , I find THAT part hard to believe but the reason no one remembers his face is not that it isn't memorable . As the probing goes on , it seems that there was a " virgin " birth back in the early 50's , and a woman claiming to be kidnapped by someone and impregnated . This is a pretty weird and creepy movie , not particularly scary but perhaps more disturbing as it goes on . Seems that Peter , the cop , may not be quite what he thinks he is either . Watch for Andy Kaufman in his first role as a baby-faced cop that goes berserk at a St . Patrick's Day parade and wastes a few people . I've always enjoyed the films of Larry Cohen , at least the earlier ones , and this is one of the best . Check it out , stars .
505286	2911571	438204	8.0	meat , madness , & mayhem	This is , without a doubt , one of the stranger movies I've seen lately , but it's actually well done . Therese is a young woman who has a thing for beef , martial arts films & Pastor Dylan ( Walter Koenig , looking rather creepy ) . Or , pretty much any man when Pastor Dylan finally dumps her . She's also a meat inspector & ends up , despite that , with mad cow disease . She's also divorced and has a long list of guys she's slept with that all leave messages on her answering machine . When her mother passes away , she is so lost in her disease and despair that she decides to become the woman she idolizes , The Girl With The Thunderbolt Kick , and go up against the Ten Tigers of Kwan Tang , or something like that , and do watch their names as they appear on your screen , it's hilarious . This strange meld of black comedy , horror , Kung Fu , and who knows what else , is an oddity , but it's also very unlike most modern films because it doesn't stick to any tried and true formula . Apparently filmed in LA but you'll be confused because of various languages spoken , for whatever reason , during the film . , well worth seeing for those with a sense of adventure .
503969	2911571	59199	8.0	Awesome drive-in junk , now on DVD !	Frankenstein Meets the Space Monster is now out on DVD ! I have yearned to see this movie for so long and now it's on DVD and I watched it last night and I was quite happy to now have it in my collection . But , be forewarned , this movie is best enjoyed by fans of schlock horror and science fiction , the kind like drive-ins used to show in the sixties , and it's by no stretch of the imagination a " good " movie . But for hard-core " so bad it's good " fans like myself , it's a gem . The story , such as it is , is this : There's some aliens hanging around out in outer space in a saucer , and they keep blowing up earth's manned space flights from NASA , thinking they're missiles sent to destroy them . NASA decides to send a robot named Frank , who looks quite human but a quick trip to the back room and he's just a robot with fake skin and a wig thrown over the top of a few vacuum tubes and capacitors ? Yeah right . Anyway Frank goes up , the spaceship gets shot down , the folks in the saucer see it was a manned flight and the evil Princess ( who is dressed kind of like Cleopatra or something ) berates her folks for shooting down manned flights . And then the aliens land on earth to start collecting babes in bikinis . For their planet has just had a nuclear war & they're wanting to start fresh again . Now astronaut / robot Frank has encountered these bad dudes and gotten half his fake face blown off for his trouble , and is wandering around Puerto Rico aimlessly . But his creator ( James Karen , " Return of the Living Dead " ) is out looking for him with his assistant and they eventually find him and are trying to help him . Meanwhile , the aliens are running amok and taking their collection of babes collected from discos and beaches back to their spaceship , covering them with sheer curtains and sending them down a conveyor belt while the evil aliens watch and nod their approval . Also on the spaceship is some kind of creature , I would venture to call it a space monster , based on the title of the flick , but that's just me . Eventually Frank the astronaut / robot finds his way to the ship , rescues the babes , fights the monster , and saves earth , or at least Puerto Rico , I don't know if the rest of earth was in danger . There weren't very many aliens . There's a lot of groovy music in this too , sometimes pop and sometimes twangy ' twisting on the beach ' stuff . Overall this is quite a mess , technically , but I loved every minute of it and it's bad sixties horror-schlock at its best . .
505504	2911571	76162	8.0	Absolutely bizarre " lost " film is well worth seeking out	" Hausu " ( AKA House ) from 1977 , is one of the strangest Japanese ( or otherwise ) films I've ever laid eyes on . Seems like a young girl and her friends go to visit the young girl's aunt in a big old house in the middle of nowhere , and auntie is not quite what she seems . You see , auntie was to have gotten married but her fiancée died in the war and she never got over it . So now she lives in this big house all by herself ( with a strange long-haired cat the girls call Snowball ) and when the girls arrive , things at first seem idyllic , but then change as the girls start to meet with odd fates , one by one . Now , this was described as " if Dario Argento directed Beetlejuice " but while that's appropriate in some ways it doesn't quite say enough . It seems like auntie is no longer among the living and has to have unmarried women ( or girls ) in order to maintain her life-force , meaning , that she takes theirs . Oops , not exactly a good way to spend a holiday . This is chock full of bizarre happenings and imagery and at times it appears to be a children's show , and at other times it appears to be a children's show by way of David Lynch or Dario Argento . Young Oshare , the niece of the woman who owns the house , may or may not be changing in ways that she & her friends would prefer not to happen , while the other girls are merely falling victim to the evils of the house . The mayhem in this is mostly done with over-the-top effects and results in lots of severed limbs & bodily fluids but for all that it's not exactly graphic , for it's macabre without being too gruesome . I had never heard of Nobuhiko Obayashi before ( the director ) and in looking at his list of films I've never heard of any of them either . . . I confess that after seeing " Hausu " I'm interested in finding more by him & hope it's as entertaining as this . An absolutely bizarre " lost " film , part horror , part comedy , part parody , part kid's show ( sort of ) , almost indescribable but well worth seeing for anyone that likes truly weird stuff . .
503881	2911571	59095	8.0	Enjoyably strange	Marcello Mastroianni & Ursula Andress play cat and mouse in this weird little Italian movie , a kind of " Most Dangerous Game " Italian-style , with odd little trendy ( for the time ) things thrown in everywhere . To prevent wars there is now a Bureau of The Hunt , or something like that , where people are assigned as hunter or victim , and they take out their aggressions that way instead . Seems like there's always someone stalking or fleeing though so hard to see how that works , I guess . Anyway , Andress plays an American come to Rome to stalk her prey , Mastroianni , and she gets a little to close to him to want to kill him . To complicate matters he's pursued by his ex-wife and his current girlfriend Olga , while trying to figure out if Andress is meant to be his killer or not . This is all very well done with lots of cheesy background music and visual feasts for the eyes , and is far enough off the beaten track to be worthwhile for those who don't care for mainstream . It's actually kind of a fun film , and watch for Andress ' double-barrel assassination of her stalker in the first few minutes of the film at Club Masoch . , check it out .
505310	2911571	422419	8.0	Oh good , more comparisons to Shaun of the Dead	Despite the fact that there was a comparison to " Shaun of the Dead " on the cover of this , I watched it anyway . In fact , the blurb said it was " Better than Shaun of the Dead " . Well , since everything these days is " all that and a bag of chips " no matter how bad it is , I was pleasantly surprised that this was as good as it was . But it isn't better than " Shaun of the Dead " . Anyway , a small town in Alabama is plagued by Zombies , all of a sudden . Is it the result of a never-shown space craft that kidnapped a man , a woman , and a 1964 and a half Ford Mustang ? Well , maybe . Anyway , a video store owner is the first to be visited by a zombie , and since the sheriff is out of town and the deputy went back to the place of some woman he went out with last night ( who just happened to live in Panama City , Florida ) , the town is without an authority figure , so the video store guy plops the corpse in the lobby of the sheriff's office with a post-it note stuck to its forehead ( for the sheriff to call him on Monday , of course ) . A guy from Homeland Security parachutes in to look into this problem , commandeers the car belonging to the sheriff's secretary and begins to investigate . The secretary calls in a former deputy and ex-boyfriend to the investigation and pretty soon the zombies are running amok and they're all trying to hide out away from them . This is all done in a kind of sarcastic and dry humor , so must be seen to be appreciated , really . Best is the woodsman / survivalist guy leaving his young daughters at home and telling the oldest one what to do if anyone comes by the house while he's gone , and walking her through the steps to deal with strangers if they try to get into the house . Later in the movie the front yard is shown and there are dozens of corpses lying there from her blowing them away . This has a rather ambiguous ending though , but other than that it's pretty damn funny and while my review may not necessarily reflect that , that's because it's more one of those movies you have to really see to appreciate . And please do , there aren't that many good low-budget horror / comedies out there these days that are worth seeing .
505204	2911571	65206	9.0	one of my favorites	Hey now , this is one of my favorite movies . A woman living in an isolated house near the desert ( in Arizona ) is having trouble with housekeepers . None of them seem to stay very long . But every time a housekeeper leaves , a new tree gets planted along the driveway ? Hmm . Well , along comes Ruth Gordon , who seems to have lost one of her friends somewhere along the way and this house is the last place of residence . So Ruth goes " undercover " as a feisty and weird housekeeper to Geraldine Paige ( who fancies herself to be quite the goddess , I reckon , expecting the housekeeper to light her smokes and fix her drinks ) . Ruth though , is in cahoots with her nephew , the dude that played a doctor on Emergency eons ago . So while she's sticking her neck out , he's got her covered . Or does he ? Hmm . Anyway , this is a VERY well done and awesome whodunnit , with more than a few creepy overtones . Anyone that enjoys the late Ruth Gordon will delight in this . Highly recommended !
505231	2911571	96218	9.0	Welcome to the dark	Welcome to the darkly disturbing world of Guy Maddin , whose films always seem to take place in the 20's or 30's and yet have a disturbingly modern sense to them . In an outbreak of " plague " in a small Canadian town , two hospital-ridden victims vie for the attention of the nurses and make fish out of tree bark . One goes blind and a nurse paints his glasses black . The hospital itself is above a animal barn , so there's feathers and hay everywhere . Einar the Lonely is a guy that lives in a shack by a lake , and smokes fish , and he even slicks down his hair with fish-oil . Lots of it , ick . We also have ( in the hospital ) a minstrel , complete with black-face . Hmm . There are surgeries with farm implements and in place of anesthesia the nurses put on a puppet show to divert the attention of the patient . If all this sounds pretty out-there to you , well , it is , and if you're already a fan of Guy Maddin it's all pretty normal . . . . . for him . If you're a fan of David Lynch then you would probably like Guy Maddin's films , although I can't really say they have the same tone to them . Maddin also employs a nifty sense of deadpan humor in his work , which I like a lot . This is a delightfully weird film and not just a little creepy , but overall it has a bizarre quality to it that makes it quite unique and well worth seeing for the adventurous . , check it out !
505623	2911571	57181	9.0	How I stopped worrying and learned to love this bomb	It's interesting to hear the interview with Ray Dennis Steckler on the DVD , because apparently the original title of this conflicted with Dr . Strangelove and Stanley Kubrick had a fit , so one word in the title ( why ) had to be changed to who . This is a delightfully incoherent movie , it's got dancing girls , zombie monsters , mean gypsy fortune tellers ( one with a wart that moves from one side of her face to the other ) and the ever-goofy looking Cash Flagg ( Steckler himself ) as Jerry , a " free spirit " who loves fun . There are some sinister ( ha ! ) things going on at a carnival , seems that a gypsy fortune teller is turning people into zombies by throwing acid on them , and putting them in the back room . Not exactly the best known method for that but apparently it works just fine . The sequences with the choreographed dancers are a feast for the eyes , with " mod " outfits and cool music . The colors are beautiful and if you just stop thinking about how little sense this all makes then you'll do just fine . One dance number is " Shook Out of Shape " which was covered by The Surf Trio out of Portland , OR , a few years ago , it makes perfect sense to me that they'd like this movie . This is by no means a good movie , but for some twisted reason it's always been one of my favorites and if you have a spirit of fun and trashiness , then you should check it out . I am not sure about the label it's out on , the Media Blasters " Guilty Pleasures " spin-off , I'm not sure I feel at all guilty for watching this . Ray Dennis Steckler rules .
504254	2911571	74949	9.0	Awesome Bollywood supernatural thriller	This is an awesome Bollywood thriller based on the premise that certain cobras can take human form . Our film begins with one such cobra ( in human form ) being attacked by either vultures or eagles , hard to say , but a man with a gun saves Nag by shooting the bird . This man ( Vijay ) then tells of his quest to find these cobras , and Nag tells him he knows something of this , and shows that by turning into a cobra and slithering away after the promise that he & the female Nagin will dance . And dance and sing , they do , of course . Reena Roy is quite beautiful and makes a very slinky cobra in human form . Of course , Vijay tells his friends of this and they think he's crazy , till he talks them into coming with him and seeing this very rite again , and during this rite Nag , the male , turns into a cobra and thinking that Nagin is threatened , one of Vijay's friends shoots him and kills him . Not a good move , of course , since now Nagin will have her revenge on each and every one of the men involved . Since this is a Bollywood movie , there is of course a long and somewhat meandering road to the finish , but this is never boring . A lot of character development of these doomed men is explored . These men eventually ask the help of a holy man , to protect them from this vengeful cobra woman , and they're given amulets to wear to protect them , but Nagin is very clever and manages to work her way though them by hook or crook . The music in this is very beautiful at times , especially the song with the male & female cobra dancing . There's also a rather interesting disco song of sorts , that has fantastic instrumentation & is unlike anything I've ever heard . This film is also in Eastmancolor , so it has beautiful saturated colors as well . Sadly enough , before I saw this film I saw a rather cheesy ( and abbreviated ) remake called " Pyaasi Nagin " a couple weeks ago , with the same haunting snake song but with the character of Nagin played by a young woman who was , uh , rather plump , OK , she looked like Petunia Pig . Accept no substitutes , Reena Roy is light-years better . Anyway , if you're an adventurous sort and like foreign films , check this out . The special effects are somewhat silly at times ( come on , this was 1976 ) but other than that this is quite good . .
505216	2911571	174834	9.0	Creepy grim fairy tale is excellent but not for the kids	Jiri Barta's " Krysar " ( rat catcher ) is a somewhat creepy and disturbing take on the Pied Piper of Hamelin . According the IMDb keywords this falls under " kids and family " . I suggest that the kids don't watch this though , that is , unless you like them climbing into bed with you at 2 AM after screaming nightmares . The tale is basically simple and the same as the one that you probably heard when you were a kid , although the characters appear to be creepy wood-carvings that are astonishingly intricate , and the only real " live action " creatures are the rats themselves , which do get pretty bold at times . So of course this little town is overrun by rats and then , on a hill , far away , you see the piper himself , who looks rather ominous ( at best ) and who comes to the town and agrees to get rid of the rats for a sum . Of course he does but the sum isn't paid and then after that bad things happen to the townspeople . I can't imagine how much work went into all this . It's a 55 minute feature and it's flawless in its execution . There is some dialog in this but it sounds like just nonsense babble , so there's no subtitles , but one doesn't really need them . This is not lacking in humor either , as the townspeople interact with each other before the rats really become a problem . Available on Jiri Barta's " Labyrinth of Darkeness " DVD & well worth your time to seek out . .
504589	2911571	60089	9.0	Wonderfully odd but more for adults than kids	Imagine ( if you will ) , Alice in Wonderland with the music of Ravi Shankar and none of the characters in make-up ? Sound strange ? It is . But it's also more in the spirit of Lewis Carroll's stories than the Walt Disney version ( or other versions ) . I did rather like Peter Cook as the mad hatter & one will find all manner of British actors of the day in this one too , like Michael Redgrave , Peter Sellers , and several that I recognize but couldn't name . The black and white photography is crisp and clear & the Victorian summer setting is perfect . Alice is one strange little character as she never seems to look at anyone else and seems to be in a dream world all her own , but that's what this is all about in the first place , isn't it ? This is probably more true to the original story than many other versions , and while it does get confusing because no one is in makeup , it's still well worth seeing and some of the scenes are quite striking . I wouldn't sit around and listen to the music of Ravi Shankar as a rule but it does actually fit in quite well with the eeriness of this BBC production , and was apparently quite an adventurous choice of music for 1966 . Well worth seeing if you like Lewis Carroll and want to see an very odd adaptation of his work . .
505359	2911571	23649	9.0	very unsettling film for the time in which it was made	If you enjoy older films of the horror genre then you should definitely give this a look if you haven't already . A young man , Allan Grey , comes to a strange house where shadows live on their own , and things are not at all what they seem . He also stumbles across a man and his two daughters , one daughter which is quite ill & that's because she's the victim of a vampire . This is supposedly filmed on already damaged film stock so it has a very gauzy and odd look to it , and for the type of film this is that works well . This whole film is one eerie experience in the surreal and the strange , and it holds up quite well in this day & age given that it was made in the early 30's . One is never sure if what they're seeing is dream , fantasy , or reality . It took a while for me to figure out some of what I was looking at , particularly one man's shadow that is shoveling dirt , and eventually I realized what I was seeing was taking place in reverse , with the dirt flying onto the shovel . In another scene Allan witnesses a shadowy figure climbing a ladder in a barn or something , only to realize that the shadowy figure IS a shadow & it reattaches itself to its owner . There is a rather creepy doctor who is a suspect in this whole vampire thing , for he only shows up at night , and Allan is " volunteered " to provide blood for the young woman who is stricken , after which he seems to have out of body experiences . All in all this is like a bad dream come true , and despite the " quality " of the print , this whole thing comes off as a minor masterpiece . Very recommended , although the Image DVD has rather clunky subtitles , but that's a minor thing . .
503927	2911571	59410	10.0	jet black comedy with creepy overtones	Finally " The Loved One " is available on DVD and is now available for your viewing pleasure . I read , perhaps somewhere on the message boards here , that this version would be " colorized " , but that's not true , it's in glorious original black and white . The tag line of ' something to offend everyone ' is still applicable , too , although this may in no way be QUITE as offensive as it was in 1965 . This is dark , dark , black comedy , and there are some scenes that are just plain creepy and menacing , which is mostly due to the funereal organ music that makes up a good deal of the soundtrack . Robert Morse plays Dennis Barlow , a young man who wins an airline ticket while at the airport in England and decides to come to LA to see his uncle , who is an artist and works at a movie studio . When his uncle is fired from the movie studio he hangs himself , leaving his nephew to make the funeral arrangements at the creepy Whispering Glades , a vast cemetery for WASPs only , run by the Blessed Reverend ( as played by Jonathan Winters ) . While making funeral arrangements Dennis finds himself falling for the young cosmetician Aimee ( Anjanette Comer ) and pursues a relationship with the reluctant girl . Seems as though Whispering Glades is a way of life , and it's more than a way of life , it's kind of a cult run by the Blessed Reverend . Also working at the funeral parlor is the creepy Mr . Joyboy ( Rod Steiger ) who also has a thing for Aimee . After several failed attempts at employment , Dennis finds work at a Pet Cemetery ( The Happier Hunting Ground ) and meets with various misadventures while trying to romance Aimee . Aimee is rather torn between Dennis and Mr . Joyboy . She does get invited to Mr . Joyboy's home and meets mom , about 400 pounds of fun who watches food commercials on TV with lip-smacking glee and attacks an entire roast pig while lounging in bed . Also notable is an appearance by a young Paul Williams who plays a model rocket genius who adds a bit of flair to the Pet Cemetarie's repertoire by sending critters up into space , and this is noticed by the Blessed Reverend who involves the US government in an attempt to move on from Whispering Glades as a " Place of Rest " and turn it into a retirement home while sending the interred bodies into space . Yes , this sounds like a busy movie and it is , and this all actually comes together much better in the actual movie . This is top notch stuff and if you like black comedies and have never seen it , grab it , you'll love it . Perhaps I hadn't really noticed the creepy overtones this film has before because of the sound , which is definitely more pronounced through your stereo speakers ( or home sound system , whatever ) than through a tinny TV speaker . A wonderful film , well done , a good look and feel to it and almost perfect in every way . .
504052	2911571	169222	10.0	wild and weird	I am not sure if there's a name for the " current wave " of Japanese films that have surfaced in the US in the past few years , some of which actually date back to the late 90's , but I'm pretty much grabbing anything I can find on the Kino Video label , so far I haven't gone wrong . According to the back of the box , Shark Skin Man & Peach Hip Girl is " in the spirit of Natural Born Killers " but if so then it's channeled by David Lynch . There's a bleached blonde guy in a leather bullet proof suit that crawls around on the ground sniffing like a dog , there's an amateur hit-man that drives around in a little 60's car straight out of Ultra Man , dresses in 50's clothing and has a rather geeky personality , supposedly he's " love struck " but with who is the question ? Anyway , this takes the cake for bizarre & eccentric , has some of the characteristic overblown & cartoonish violence , but the focus of this one is more on the strange than the violent . A real hoot and well worth seeing .
