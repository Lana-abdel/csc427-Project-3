438532	1617546	336857	1.0	Imitation is the sincerest form of Theft	There were many Chaplin imitators . Billy West made a career doing Chaplin for several years and did some very fine work - - and some not so good . West had a real sense of comedy , good timing , and Oliver Hardy - - occasionally Charley Chase would direct . People would hold Chaplin look-alike contests - - the story is that Chaplin entered one of them and lost - - and as recently as the 1970s , I saw Gloria Swanson do a fine Chaplin imitation on tv . Miss Minerva Courtney , however , took imitation to its final form : she lifted Chaplin's films in whole , with herself as the Little Tramp . This one is THE CHAMPION and she has no flair at all . None . She sort of sucks the energy from the screen and there is something that is almost right about the camera placement that makes your teeth hurt . Save your teeth to crack walnuts , I say .
438524	1617546	232267	1.0	Where ?	Once again , Mr . James White , famous for his views of the backs of people's hats , has turned his camera to a fascinating subject , to wit : what do the railroad tracks look like from a moving train , when the train is moving past beautiful scenery . Well , they look like railroad tracks . That's a load off my mind and , I'm sure , yours .
439371	1617546	49092	1.0	I'm taking names	I see that there are six people who gave this idiotic , misbegotten , miscast film a 10 rating . I can forgive the twenty or so people who gave TERROR OF TINY TOWN a ten rating , but anyone who gave this a rating substantially higher than 1 is an idiot . Anyone who gave it a rating higher than 3 has never seen this movie . Anyone who gave it a 10 should be punished , punished severely . They should be forced to see it TWICE . I demand their names !
439166	1617546	331597	1.0	Not	This is not a panoramic view of Newport . This is actually what happens when you put a camera at the back of a small , black-smoke-belching boat , point the camera at the prow right past the smoke stack , and race the boat parallel to the shore . Newport ? Why not ? You might as well claim it is Newport . For those with a passion for the study of bad movies , it should come as no surprise that the credited producer of this movie was James White , the man who singlehandedly invented bad movies . Lumiere and Pathe were producing beautifully composed pictures based on more than fifty years of camera work . In England , they were doing the experimental movies that evolved in modern film grammar . Mr . White , however , was busy clipping the interesting portion of the frame to no more than ten percent of the picture so that he could show us the back of the hats of people watching things .
439002	1617546	63571	1.0	The Excuse of Art	The major talents involved with this movie - - director Joseph Losey and actors Robert Mitchum , Elizabeth Taylor and Mia Farrow , have done some great work and some lousy work - - Mitchum was inclined to phone in performances unless he got interested . But , like many people who get involved with the arts , when they were doing something on the edge , they doubtless knew they could fail - - but a lot of the people here seem to fall into the common fallacy that great talent can never fail - - as if DONOVAN'S REEF is a great film because it was directed by John Ford or A COUNTESS FROM HONG KONG was a laugh riot because it was directed by Chaplin . Or that every performance given by Paul Newman was great . Sometimes people make mistakes and the greater the genius , the greater the mistakes . About the only good thing I can say about this movie is that the camera work by Gerry Fisher is excellent and occasionally distracting . After that , everything bogs down because of the idiotic , minimalist story in which nothing is ever really explained - - but the plot is that psycho Mia Farrow's mother has just died so she falls in with psycho-hooker Elizabeth Taylor , whose daughter has just died , until psycho step-daddy Bob Mitchum in a hideous beard and sporting an accent that varies form Irish to Australian to his basic accent , discourses on statutory rape . That's very little to build a hundred-minute movie on and , despite everyone - - except possibly for Mitchum - - doing their best , there are long periods of nothing . Some might look upon these as meditative sequences . I find them boring . So what is the result ? You have characters you don't care about doing very little of interest in a cluttered world - - I suspect the set decorator was getting a kickback from prop suppliers - - and the question arises why this was released at all . Answer : because some people would go to see it based on the track record of the major talent involved and even if the project would not show a profit , at least the loss would be ameliorated . . . . and forty years later some money is still being picked up by showing it on cable TV .
438872	1617546	215573	2.0	Wrong Composition	As usual , Messrs . White and Heisse , the originators of the bad school of film making , have demonstrated in this film that they know nothing about composition . The train approaches the onlookers and the camera straight on and the right hand of the frame is wasted until the last moment of this film . Bad camera placement would be their stock in trade throughout their careers . Although I have blamed Mr . White for this habit in other reviews , the new EDISON : THE MOVIES BEGIN set of dvds from Kino credit the pair of them for many of the bad movies I have held Mr . White solely responsible for . As a final note , the movie going public of 1897 was , undoubtedly , aware of this failure . These actualities brought distant scenes to people who might never otherwise have seen them . And yet , considering that movies were in a slump during this period hardly seems coincidental to me . The audience may not have been consciously aware of this , but they stayed away in droves . And artists and photographers knew all about composition in this period .
438396	1617546	38953	3.0	Smarter than the narration	Interesting nature photography showing the first year of a life of a collection of fox kits , made ridiculous by being shown in double time and a ridiculously anthropomorphic narration . Turn the sound off on this one .
438996	1617546	156169	4.0	Pause for a Travelogue	This well-meaning but incredibly muddled short feature - - it looks to have been about half an hour until eked out by the interpolation of a travelogue about kibbutzim in Palestine and a short silent film about two lovers , one royal , the other Jewish , who commit suicide in a variation of the story of Esther - - is about a Jewish judge who is up for a nomination for governor , but the trial he is presiding over , apparently of a Black man falsely accused of murder , is producing a lot of threats on his life . Meanwhile his father is coming back from Palestine or a visit and his daughter is being pursued by two men . It would give me great pleasure to rate this considerably higher , but the actors are clearly uncertain about how to act in front of the camera . In fact , Bud Pollard the actor seems to be watching the camera in a rather wary fashion in the early scenes , which Bud Pollard the director may not have caught . More a curio than a a worthwhile movie , it would be interesting to find out what silent movie they added in .
439098	1617546	28483	4.0	We Didn't Go to this movie	This mild little comedy of how Walter Abel goes to his college homecoming in order to secure a contract for his company might have made a nifty little movie a few years earlier , especially as Una Merkel appears in it and few were better in sexy pre-code comedies than she . But , alas , the enforcement of the Code was embraced enthusiastically by Metro , and this comes through as contrived and a little desperate . Some amusement is added by a trio of good lead comics doing their shticks : Charles Butterworth does his blank-faced moron and has the most amusing lines ; Hugh Herbert plays his amiable ditherer to usual good effect ; and most of Walter Catlett's role seems to have wound up on the cutting room floor . Joseph Santley's direction is , as always , competent but unable to produce anything surprising and the other behind-the-camera talent is from Metro's B company . Not really worth your time .
439463	1617546	248433	4.0	No , it's the 33-year-old Semon	A Semon comedy that reveals most of the problems with his work : the gags are well executed , but without much flair and with no logic in their set-up . Semon works backstage in a theater where open jars of nitroglycerin are left sitting about for animals in a magician's acts to drink from ; where open barrels of lamp black are stored so that wind machines , turned on for no particular reason , can spew their contents onto the audience , who continue to watch the show , unconcernedly wearing blackface ; where stage managers carry about guns so they can rob performers of their jewels - - which performers , of course , bring with them to the theater , seemingly for that very purpose . The whole thing develops into a fair but derivative Max Sennet cops-and-railroad chase in which excellent stuntwork is executed , until the train runs into a rail car full of dynamite , which is left standing , as rail cars full of dynamite always are , on the main track ; and the whole thing is " explained " by reducing the chase to a dream sequence . Semon performs his pratfalls and daredevil feats competently , and Oliver Hardy is stuck with his usual thankless role of heavy . The movie , however , is not about Hardy , as its other reviewer would have us believe , but Semon . Oh . I said that this movie shows most of the problems with Semon's work . The other problem seems to be that he repeated the same gags from movie to movie . Not too awful an experience if you've never seen one before , but to an audience that sees the same gags executed by the same comic in the same sense-free environment every two months . . . . well , if you're seen one , you've seen ' em all , I suppose .
438605	1617546	57122	4.0	End of the Line	Veteran MGM B director Roy Rowland ended his career with three cheap westerns co-produced with MGM and shot in Spain . In some ways this looks like one of the gritty westerns that were being turned out by Italy , but while the body count is adequate , Rowland was too steeped in the MGM mystique - - this movie is too visually polite , the music score a tad too lush and the actors too clean to compare with Sergio Leone's ' Man With No Name ' , so the result is nothing particular : too pretty for grit , too gritty for a traditional B and even a script co-written by Borden Chase can't do much . The actors try to do something with their performances , particularly Alex Nicol , but his character lacks enough definition to be particularly interesting . Director Rowland's son , Steve has a featured role as ' The Kid ' . One wonders how he felt about that during the shoot .
438921	1617546	230238	4.0	Aptly Named	This is not one of the high points of Buster's career . He seems to be used for his remaining marquee value here . Even the two falls from the car near the beginning of the movie do not seem to be performed by him - - when Buster fell , his entire body moved and reacted , like a a trout struggling to not be drawn in by the universe . No , that's a stuntman taking the fall , competently but with no flair , and that makes this a waste of time . Far better to watch him doing little comic bits in big movies . This is , in short , far more of a Jules White comedy than a Buster Keaton comedy . Although the print on the new Keaton at Columbia set is far better than any more generally available , this is a short only for completists .
439427	1617546	22587	4.0	Not When it's good animation	Early Merrie Melodie is primarily of interest for its use of Gus Arnheim's Band to perform the title song . The gags and animation are pretty awful , looking like third = rate Disney animation . You'd be better off finding a good copy of the original Brunswick record .
439122	1617546	121608	4.0	The Buccaneer Act Three	What we have here is Demille's THE BUCCANEER showing just the highlights of the Battle of New Orleans and the celebratory party afterwards , with some fine color photography and no story . In 1939 this was a mildly interesting short subject of the American History as Hagiography type , but little else . Most of the story is told in pompous voice-over , with lines like " Only his deep loyalty to the American people " and " Andrew Jackson was the first president sprung from the common people and his door was always open to his friends . " I would suggest that you read a good book on the subject instead of wasting ten minutes on this effort .
438463	1617546	35916	4.0	Nightmare Inducing	I have nightmares about this one . It's not enough that I walk about , my head pounding with a headache because I can't get Carmen Miranda singing " Paducah " out of my brain , but I keep seeing these bizarre Busby Berkley images in my mind , retreaded musical numbers from SUNNY SIDE UP . Avoid this one if you possibly can !
439160	1617546	137259	4.0	Work : when you don't need it , it's great	Andre Carel ( with accent marks ) is the son of a rich father . He never has had to work and he hasn't and as a consequence has gone literally mad with boredom , so mad that his old tutor , played by the wonderful Michael Simon near the beginning of his career , has been recalled to service as a warden . Andre takes a fancy to a girl of the petite bourgeoisie , and decides to see if she would like him without his money . He gets a job working on the barge owned by her father , transporting stones across Lake Lucerne and not only wins the girl , but discovers health , happiness and usefulness . We get to see sailboats and the scenery around Lake Lucerne . Very pretty . Michel Simon works hard at producing one of his amazing cinematic grotesques . Other than these two features , the film is a flat failure : the script is humorless , there is almost no tension and , indeed , very little movement . As the film finished its first seventy minutes , I became convinced it was shot by a portrait photographer . In the final section there are signs of movement , but it looks as if it was done by lifting bits from the movies of Louis Lumiere : ' Lancement d'un navire à la Ciotat ' , say . Look at Louis Lumiere's works . . . . and Michel Simon's later stuff . Avoid this one .
439065	1617546	21495	4.0	Rotten	Bad sound , poor script and Al St . John making faces : what less could you ask for ? St . John and Jimmy Aubrey waste their time dropping dishes in a restaurant with two patrons , one boss and a floor show of eight . There's singing , but the sound makes it impossible to follow . There's dancing , but it isn't terribly well choreographed . And , as said before , there's Al St . John , who can take a fall , but that's the limit of his talents . Give it a miss .
438542	1617546	30613	5.0	One of the Weaker Tashlins	Until the rise of Daffy Duck and Bugs Bunny at the very end of the 1930s , Porky Pig was Termite Terrace's biggest star , but he was largely a straight man . In this one he is a farmer doing his spring planting , beset by a lazy watch dog ( " I must be a watch dog - - I'm full of ticks " ) and raiding chickens . Part of my lack of enjoyment may be due to the poor coloring imposed on the print I saw . Tashlin tries his best , using some of his interesting compositions In the beginning scenes , while Porky is harrowing the ground before planting , he is shown in a tight shot from a very low angle - - almost a worm's-eye view . Tash would go from directing cartoons with very live-action compositions to live-action movies with very cartoonish set-ups . but this is not , alas , one of his better efforts .
439195	1617546	10969	5.0	A Bad Trip On A Hash Pipe	Carefully conceived and generally well-executed visually , this movie fails because it fails to take advantage of the story's structure , which is just hinted at in this movie and because of the over-the-top performance of the pudgy Stacia Napierkowska as Queen Antinea of the remnants of Atlantis which , as we all know , is in the middle of the Sahara Desert . Spoilers : the first half of the movie uses itself up in getting to the Hidden City - - which 19th century popular fiction would have us believe , are scattered across Africa like wads of chewing gum on the bottom of school desks . Mostly it works like the revelations of story within story of the Arabian Nights , However , the inmost story is of a different order . It is preceded by the two male leads ' smoking Hashish - - accidentally - - and ended by the survivor heading back to the Hidden City like an addict . It should possess the air of a fever dream . Instead we are confronted with a relatively straightforward story interspersed by the hefty Miss Napierkowa throwing hissy fits and very much in need of a hairbrush . Kudos to a beautifully designed and shot production and to excellent and restrained performances by the rest of the cast , particularly Georges Melchior . But Miss Napierkowska pretty much made the audience laugh in embarrassment .
438843	1617546	6322	5.0	' Twas Ever Thus	A typical Keystone flirting-in-the-park one-reeler , this one is differentiated slightly by dressing the players in early nineteenth century garb and having them adopt their manners - - and they do carry it off most convincingly . But once you get past that , there's nothing to make this one different from any of the dozen or so that Keystone turned out from 1914-1916 . Mack Swain , as always , is good as someone down on his luck . Played a little differently , we might have sympathy for the character , but ' Ambrose ' was never played for sympathy . Swein played this character for twenty years , and he remained big , bluff and human throughout .
438997	1617546	15015	5.0	Slow , Not Tangled	This is a pretty poorly acted movie : leading men Jack Mulhall and Bert Moore bring little energy or expression to their roles , although Mulhall does beat up a couple of bad ' uns towards the end of this movie about kidnapped heiresses and what happens to them . The villains don't get to act much either , although the two heroines - - Edna Murphy and Constance Bennett do a little better . The best port of this New-York shot movie is the exteriors . You get a chance to see a large swath of Manhhatan , and a goodly chunk of it is still recognizable , although altered : Times Square looks great and I wouldn't mind a chance to examine a few frames and see exactly what Mary Pickford movie is playing - - probably DOROTHY VERNON OF HADDON HALL . One piece of advice , though ; if you're driving from 63rd and Central Park West to the Brooklyn Bridge via Broadway , don't switch to 5th Avenue at Madison Square . Washington Square Park will slow you way down .
439046	1617546	87645	5.0	Good Leads Fail To Sparkle	John Ritter and Penny Marshall lead a capable TV movie comedy cast in this tale of moral love in suburbia that somehow fails to ever really get off the ground . Director Tony Bill does an able job and the lack of sparkle is , for me , something of a mystery . The early scenes are played , perhaps , a bit too slow and straight . The situation of the affair that triggers the plot , perhaps , is telegraphed or maybe it tries too hard to be the anti-BOB & CAROL & TED AND ALICE in its own , TV-clean way . Certainly there is nothing in the dialogue to raise it above average . In any case , there is nothing that seems to me to be clearly wrong with this movie , and it may work out better for you , if you are fond of the early 1980s . But I think not .
438681	1617546	387	5.0	Before Its Time	Although Melies was a groundbreaker in many aspects of the cinema , including telling stories , fade cutting , trick films , stag films and religious stories , this one may hold the record : the story is that in order to meet the demand for films of the coronation , he filmed this reenactment - - and released it before Edward was crowned ! This is one of the many previously lost or infrequently seen Melies pictures that have been made available by Serge Bromberg , David Shepherd and a myriad of other hands in the newly issued DVD set GEORGES MELIES : FIRST WIZARD OF CINEMA . Required viewing for anyone interested in the history of movies . . . . . and a lot of fun .
438983	1617546	11129	5.0	Not Really Felix	Although this appears as the second short on The Felix the Cat dvd collection , it does not resemble Felix particularly . The cat looks like a cleaned-up version of Krazy Kat and the story takes place in a dream after some kids have been reading " Huckleberry Finn . " Of interest for animation historians .
439202	1617546	22425	5.0	Fast start , sloppy finish	The first part of this movie , about the birth and rearing of " Tommy Boy " , is pretty good , if a tad sentimental . Ernest Torrence does his usual excellent job . In the second half , Tommy Boy leaves the farm and falls in with bad companions , and the whole thing degenerates into into bad soap opera . The camerawork is erratic : the shots in the field were apparently shot MOS and look pretty good , but the second half becomes stage bound .
438885	1617546	32218	5.0	Ritz Brothers vs . Andrews Sisters	If you don't like the Ritz Brothers - - and I can only take so much of their mugging myself - - then avoid this Universal B movie . It is not , I hasten to say , a complete waste of time . The best bit in it is a burlesque of those novelty Latin dances from from the Astaires-Rogers movies called ' The Brooklyn Nanga ' , which runs to the scansion of ' The Carioca ' . Once you've mentioned that , you've exhausted the strong points of this movie as everyone heads down to Argentina , where polo-playing George Reeves - - looking like John Carroll - - pretends to be a bandito called ' El Tigre ' in order to romance Grace McDonald . Some decent although unmemorable songs and Ritz Brother routines fill out the time and while this is not the best musical ever made , it is a pleasant enough time waster to make you stay through the end - - although it won't make fans for any of the talent involved .
438434	1617546	864851	5.0	Oy Vey	With the departure of Mack Sennett from Biograph for the greener pastures of Keystone , Eddie Dillon became Biograph's leading comedy director , usually under the supervision of D . W . Griffith . I am loath to credit Griffith with any hand in this strange little comedy , because it lacks anything in the way of worthwhile story construction , although it does have the usual Biograph visual look to it - - the famous ' Biograph Right Wall ' . The story is a simple one : Sammy works in a sweatshop and loves a pretty girl and she him ; but he is pressured to marry his boss ' daughter . A common enough story and situation . So what makes it funny ? Every character in it is Jewish . And how do we know they are Jewish ? Because everyone has a huge hooked nose , except , of course , for the girl that Sammy is in love with . Amusing enough in a mildly bizarre way , but it's a single joke that grows old in about thirty seconds .
438750	1617546	891288	5.0	It must be art . . . . . they're nekkid	Three young women are frolicking in the water when a man comes along and orders them out , so they leave , but not before he - - - and the audience - - get a good view . A surprising number of these dirty films survive in the Vienna Film archives from the first decade of the 20th century . Just as the first real money-makers on the Internet were the porn sites , so this sort of ' art ' film was very popular in its own time , before movies made a push to become respectable . But this sort of stag film remained popular at smokers for decades to come with young women absent or losing their clothes in an amazing variety of situations .
439283	1617546	214684	5.0	A Dog's Life	Fala was the famous Scotch Terrier owned by Franklin Delano Roosevelt during his last two presidential terms , , the cause of a bit of a controversy and a stern lesson to the Republicans that you can attack a man , but best leave his dog alone - - a lesson that Nixon learned well enough to use to advantage in his Checkers Speech . Just so there's no misunderstanding , let me state I like dogs : big dogs , anything from an Irish wolfhound down to a corgi . I have no patience with small dogs , even though my sister likes terriers and her current dog is a Westy . In any case , this short subject , giving the ' home front ' story from the viewpoint of Fala is an amusing conceit , and it's given the usual MGM polish , even though everyone is a stand in . But the idea does not travel well past World War Two and dog lovers . . . . so it come out a little too precious for my taste .
439351	1617546	249758	5.0	First LKO picture	Henry ' Pathe ' Lehman had a checkered career . He got his start in the movies by telling D . W . Griffith he was off the boat from Europe , claiming he had been a director for Pathe Freres . While working for Sennett , he was possibly the first Chaplin imitator on film . Within a year he had used his credentials to get his own studio , trying to out-Sennett Sennett . He lost it in a couple of years , but the name continued on through the end of the decade . Then when the Arbuckle scandal broke , he called a press conference and claimed that he was the fiancé of Virginia Rappe , the girl whose death had triggered the entire event . The lies he told contributed to the rage that surrounded the entire affair . In the meantime , we have this movie to consider . It stars Billy Ritchie , an ex-Karno comic who claimed he was not a Chaplin imitator and that , indeed , Chaplin stole his character . There is some fun in a rough way , but the bone-breaking slapstick is not tempered by the sort of brilliant editing that Sennett's crews could perform . Ritchie is interesting , but the entire thing is clearly a rip-off .
438853	1617546	1469	5.0	Random Adventures	This is a lesser example of Griffith's series of shorts concerned with social problems , like WHAT SHALL WE DO WITH OUR OLD ? and ONE IS BUSINESS , THE OTHER CRIME . It is , according to its first title , " suggested by Press Comment on the Tramp Evil . " Billy , a poor bootblack , played by Edna Foster , decides to try finding a town where business is better . On the road he meets with two tramps , played by Donald Crisp and Joseph Graybill . They force him to beg for him , and then kill and rob an old man . At this point , Billy protests and they decide to kill him . They lock him in a shack while they decide which of them is to do the evil deed . Billy is rescued when a friendly dog carries a plea to help to a rich family in the neighborhood . They subdue the tramps and adopt Billy . Some of what I consider to be weakness in the story - - the randomness of the tramps ' crimes - - may well be an artifact of the short length of this film and the contemporary view of tramps . It may also be an attempt to tell the story from Billy's point of view , in which adults ' actions seem capricious . Also , Griffith offers no clear solution to the problem ; but he never did . He always seemed more interested in stating a problem than solving it . In any case , this particular short , while done well enough , suffers from these , in my opinion , uncertainties . While not bad , it is certainly understandable that this is not one of Griffith's better-known pieces .
439424	1617546	12122	5.0	Broken Nightmare	Griffith returns to the Limehouse author of BROKEN BLOSSOMS to poor effect . Two years earlier we had Lilian Gish , Richard Barthelmess and Donald Crisp acting out a small melodramatic tragedy on sheer acting chops that , even today , through muddy prints , works beautifully . This time , however , we are confronted with Carol Dempster , Charles Emmett Mack and Ralph Graves - - and if you say " Who ? " three times like an owl , this movie shows you the incredible loss of acting talent that Griffith had suffered . Confronted with three actors who couldn't act - - the scene where Dempster is terrified that Graves will rape her is clearly a gloss on Gish's terror in the closet of two years ago and so inferior that it seems sacrilegious to mention them in the same sentence - - Griffith directed them with a collection of affectations to try to make up for a lack of emotions , and tried to give the entire piece some direction using a framing device of Good Vs . Evil . The total effect is ludicrous . There are some good scenes , but the three principals don't appear in any of them . Give this one a miss .
439023	1617546	32523	6.0	The Spirit of Casper	This early Chuck Jones cartoon shows the usual sarcastic edge of Termite Terrace cartoons in this era , between the self-aware humor of Carl Stallings ' music and the voice work - - provided by fellow director Tex Avery . However it also clearly shows what in this period is Jones ' weakness - - his lead character is a child of sorts , like Sniffles - - but there is little in the way of appeal to adults except for the academic one of seeing the early works of one of the great cartoon directors of all time . Jones would return to his juvenile characters later in his career , bolstered by better scriptwriters and a surer command of the essential psychology of people - - his rarely seen ' Ralphie Phillips ' cartoons like FROM A TO ZZZZ can be considered glosses on this work . . . . but their value will arise out of their understanding , rather than an overwhelming sense of cuteness .
438402	1617546	70	6.0	The Organizing genius of Capitalism	Although those mired in an antiquated theoretical framework may mistake this movie as a Marxian commentary on the oppression of the free worker and the destruction of useful property that rightfully belongs to the proletariat , in actuality , it is no such thing , but a paean to the organizing genius of of capitalism . It is an answer to Marx , a throwing down of the gauntlet . Some roustabouts are standing with sledgehammers and no idea of what to do : typical of the working class . At the command of the gang boss - - representing , as he does , the capitalist , who knows what he wants and will achieve it while paying his worker what the invisible hand of the economy will permit - - the workers , previously unmotivated , lift their hammers and destroy the wall . The wall , the Marxian theoretician will have us believe , represents some useful function of society . The twisting of things to the service of propaganda is apparent . The wall represents evil , a separation among society . Only through work , directed by the capitalist , will walls be destroyed and all profit . But there is more . The auteur retreats one step and runs the movie in reverse ! At the command of capital , labor can make or unmake a wall . Clearly labor has no voice in the process . All direction comes from the capitalist .
438723	1617546	26337	6.0	You Are There !	It's odd how certain images get so into the public mind that they become ridiculous in themselves . Here is the chubby-looking , pencil-mustachioed Frank Buck , strolling around the jungle in pith helmet and shorts , to order the natives in how to capture pythons , monkeys and tigers for zoos in the United States . It sounds ridiculous , and if you watch carefully you will see some careful camera cheating to make things look more dangerous than they actually are - - it looks , for example , as if he captures a 20-foot python by throwing his jacket over it But Buck did capture these wild animals and if there was a certain amount of cheating for the camera , well , it works . Which is all the justification one needs .
438819	1617546	142854	6.0	Typical	By this point in his career , Woody had settled into a routine sort of cartoon - - a fight with either Wally Walrus or or the Buzzard , plenty of gags on a somewhat catch-as-catch-can basis . In many ways , the style is reminiscent of MGM's Tom and Jerry cartoons , whence writer for this one , Heck Allen had come and would return . Not , I hasten to add , that there is anything wrong with that . There is a good deal of character in these cartoons and the characters rarely violate them , but there isn't much depth to them either : Wally is simple and grumpy , the Buzzard is greedy - - here , in Amerindian guise , he craves to win the archery competition against Woody and his slingshot - - and Woody is a destructive little kid . Good identification for his target audience .
439142	1617546	26116	6.0	Merrily We Roll Along	One of a standard series of cartoons for Termite Terrace over the next decade , in which the gags are set up by puns on the titles in a bookstore or magazine shop ( Clampett's BOOK REVIEW ( 1946 ) for example ) . Here , it's advertising posters for popular commercial products . About two-thirds of them are no longer sold , so it becomes an exercise in popular culture archeology . Nonetheless , I expect the modern audience to be familiar enough with , say , Bon Ami cleanser , its baby chick mascot and motto " Hasn't Scratched Yet " to catch the drift . And the gags , as one can expect in a Friz Frleeng cartoon , are amusing . That being the case , it should be noted that this cartoon saw the introduction of the song " Merrily We Roll Along " to Termite Terrace's files . Along with " The Merry-go-round Broke Down " it was their theme . Enjoy .
438467	1617546	8918	6.0	Decent but Title Heavy	I saw this one under a handicap : they didn't have a camera with a suitable aperture , so the left of the image was cut off down to Academy ratio and there was no accompaniment - - two conditions under which one should not see a silent film . However , it was that or nothing and so any reader is warned that my opinion may be influenced by these issues - - but I don't think so . I used to haunt the 80 Saint Marks and I lost a pair of shoe soles in the old Regency , glued there by thirty years ' deposit of Coca-Cola residue . At least I hope it was Coke residue . Anyway , this change-of-pace comedy shows Bill Hart doing some nice comedy - - his dislike of a top hat is most amusing - - and he climbs about the buildings of Manhattan - - Joe August must have enjoyed the trip out east - - like a combination of Douglas Fairbanks and Will Rogers . But despite a good beginning and a good ending , there is a title-heavy middle section in which every joke is contained in the titles and most of the plot events , too . The result is a middle that drags . Add in a couple of thoroughly unlikeable characters that we are supposed to like - - Arthur Shirley and his movie-father , Andrew Robson , and you have a movie that is carried solely on the abilities of William S . Hart - - which are sufficiently broad to make this worthwhile , if not a classic .
439395	1617546	277347	6.0	The End of the Beginning	Larry Semon took over the Vitagraph comedy division , changed it from a drawing room comedy sort of production unit to one emphasizing more Keystone slapstick and starred and directed some good comedies with good cinematography . But eventually , although his stuff remained popular , his budgets ballooned out of control , his gags became repetitive and instead of an ensemble of comedians , it became about Semon . Did he run out of ideas ? Was he simply unable to adjust to a more sophisticated way of constructing a comedy with a real plot and characters that would make an audience pay ? Or was he just annoyed that Chaplin and Lloyd could do these things and thought that bigger booms would substitute ? In this , we see Semon do a variation of Chaplin's THE ADVENTURER and while it is a decent enough comedy on its own terms , it doesn't begin to compare with the Chaplin effort . The gags are too cartoonish in their execution . It makes Semon , who doesn't give much of anyone screen time except for himself and Snooky the Humanzee . AlsoI can't accept a cast list which credits Norma Shearer as ' The Big V Beauty Squad ' and ranks her after a Chimpanzee , even at the beginning of her career .
438609	1617546	122662	6.0	Beautiful But Dumb	This documentary is beautiful . The photography and music , in fact , are so good , that Howard Hawks seems to have cribbed extensively from it for RED RIVER . But the narration is done in the style of a teaching nun explaining sex to a class of deaf pupils . What can you learn from this ? That people insisted on farming in a land of dust . That the first world war caused the dust bowl and vice versa . That Indians and buffalo need to be cleared and that large explosions cause headlines about President Wilson . That British tanks were used to harvest wheat and that victory parades cause erosion . Watch this , by all means , but try not to listen to the words .
438679	1617546	223725	6.0	The End of the Act	At the moment just the last ten seconds of this Melies magic act survive : it looks like he produces some cards , makes them grow and sets the enlarged but still small court cards dancing . A lovely little act and typical for Melies in this period in between the big story films like Gulliver and VOYAGE DANS LA LUNE , he made dozens of these , all a lot of fun to people who like stage magic . This is one of the many previously lost or infrequently seen Melies pictures that have been made available by Serge Bromberg , David Shepherd and a myriad of other hands in the newly issued DVD set GEORGES MELIES : FIRST WIZARD OF CINEMA . Required viewing for anyone interested in the history of movies . . . . . and a lot of fun .
438748	1617546	1032855	6.0	The business of French Postcards	Johann Schwarzer had been making dirty motion pictures for a couple of years when he turned out this rather amusing one , a full reel in length , about the travails of a photographer who specializes in feelthy pictures . We see the photographer posing his model in various states of undress and a mild payoff as a woman comes in to berate him and his customers for engaging in pornography . The humor in the piece consists of the workaday attitude of the people involved , the uncaring manner in which the woman undresses and puts on shawls that accentuate her bosom . Of course , the whole idea was to provide an excuse to show naked women . Just as the first paying sites on the Internet were the porn sites , so the first commercial home-grown movies in Austria were this sort . A surprising number of them survive in the Vienna film archives . . . . or perhaps it isn't so surprising .
439064	1617546	20258	6.0	The Young Son and Heir	Dated , stagey and suffering from a static camera , this early Philip Barry play still manages to pack a wallop due to Barry's wonderful dialogue and the strengths of the leads , Frederick March and Ann Harding , right at the beginning of their careers , but possessed of a naturalness that carries this movie along . Thanks to the Vitaphone Project for reuniting the rediscovered soundtrack to the moving image .
439422	1617546	18516	6.0	Directed by William Wyler	Decent entry in the late silent series of Mountie shorts starring Cobb , this has a little more actual acting than most entries in this series - - when they ran thin on inspiration in these shorts , they simply had the actors move slower , but not in this entry . If , like me , you're an admirer of William Wyler , you'll want to take a look at this . If not , you can skip it unless you have a hankering for leather hats .
439015	1617546	224357	6.0	Visiting Goldfish	Melies always kept the American market in mind when he made film and early on sent his brother to New York to open up an office . where said brother produced westerns for the company . He liked to employ Francis Ford , who later became a big star and gave his brother Jack his start . . . . who became John Ford . So the link from Georges Melies to John Wayne is not that far . I don't think that Melies did this one through double-exposure . I think he put a thin fish tank in front of his actors and chivvied the fish back and forth - - including at least one goldfish . This is one of the many previously lost or infrequently seen Melies pictures that have been made available by Serge Bromberg , David Shepherd and a myriad of other hands in the newly issued DVD set GEORGES MELIES : FIRST WIZARD OF CINEMA . Required viewing for anyone interested in the history of movies . . . . . and a lot of fun .
438603	1617546	234114	6.0	Trick Film Comedy	This Vitagraph film from 1907 is a fairly good trick comedy for the era . A mad scientist figures out how to convert electricity to a liquid - - which reminds me of the Thurber story about his aunt who thought electricity was leaking from empty light sockets - - and he proceeds to spray it on slow moving people , whereupon they move like lightning . This simple gag is repeated four or five times . The interesting point about this movie is that it shows signs of very careful cutting and possible back-screen projection , sometimes two or three layers of it , but done so carefully that it can only be inferred . The scientist sprays the electricity on a subject and the subject speeds up , but the scientist does not . The only way I could think of doing it was back-screen projection , but I'm not even sure it was invented at this time .
438622	1617546	25598	6.0	How You Gonna Keep ' Em Down on the Farm ?	Roach's ' The Girl Friends ' series plods on with Patsy Kelly taking the place of Zasu Pitts and with second-string director Gus Meins helming the venture . The result is a decent little comedy short with plenty of funny gags , but without , alas , the warmth and chemistry that Miss Pitts was able to bring to her relationship to Miss Todd . Besides the chemistry between Miss Pitts and Miss Todd , their characters were clearly differentiated , Zasu shy and awkward , Thelma brash . Thelma tones it down a bit here , but Patsy Kelly had only one setting . Yet they are both excellent comedians , they are willing to do all sorts of physical stunts and the gag-writing at Roach was top-notch . The result is a good comedy - - not a great one , alas , but you can't win them all with your second string team .
438425	1617546	40390	6.0	Musical Film Noir ?	This is a pleasant musical programmer from Fox in 1948 , directed by old hand Lloyd Bacon . Dan Dailey does some nice hoofing , Charles Winninger does his patented Old Time Entertainer bit , Barbara Lawrence knocks your eyes out in another small role and makes you wonder why she didn't have a major career . Fay Bainter plays the mother and Charlie Ruggles is on hand for no particular reason , but he's always welcome . And if it weren't for the air of post-war anomie that covers this production like a wet blanket , it wouldn't be anything . Pardon me while I take a few minutes of your time to make a major thesis about a minor movie . Consider : Winninger and Bainter are ex-vaudevillians . He has a good job with some appliance company in New Jersey , they live a decent life , but he is waiting for vaudeville to come back . He has trained all his children for the act and the movie concerns itself with the various members of his family going their own ways . One girl gets married and almost disinherited . The second falls in love . That leaves Dan Dailey . When a spot in a Broadway show falls through , Dan decides to accept that scholarship to MIT and to play baseball ( ! ) At this point , Sig Rumann shows up with an offer of sixteen weeks in Denver . . . . The constant disillusionment is , of course , assuaged by the brightness of the production . But in the end , Winninger is left , seemingly happy with his role as a newly promoted vice president of an appliance company . But is he ? What is this but the flip side of film noir ?
438491	1617546	35857	6.0	Prat Falls	This is another amusing episode in the " Sergeant Doubleday ' series of streamliners from the Hal Roach studio , full of pratfalls and mugging . The streamliners were short features intended for double or triple bills , averaging about 50 minutes . This series is made amusing by the contrasting of Doubleday , a draftee with photographic memory made a sergeant for it , and his would-be nemesis Sergeant Ames , a twenty-year man who keeps trying to one-up Doubleday and fails continually . This episode is enlivened when the two of them are given new trainees . Doubleday's bunch are Kentucky mountain men , ringled by Arthur Hunnicutt who spent the 1950s and 1960s playing the type . Frank Faylen also shows up as Captain Gillis . Presumably after the war he retired and reared his son , Dobie .
438613	1617546	27541	6.0	Eburne and Fazenda	Maude Eburne and Louise Fazenda play off each other wonderfully , as two long-time friends and partners in a doughnut shop who part when one of Eburne's harebrained investments pay off and she leaves to get her daughter into society . The two bring an sense of cameraderie , irritation and mutual sympathy that is reminiscent of Laurel and Hardy and the supporting cast , including the ever dependable Franklin Pangborn and a young Anne Rutherford are fine . The script , however , veers from beautifully played small moments of pensiveness to to unfunny moments of forced slapstick . Eburne plays her role as if she is playing the snobby wife in RUGGLES OF RED GAP instead of the down-to-earth Maw Pettingill , which role she did take . The comedic partnership is very uneven and the net result is generally ill-humored . Still , it's worth a look to see what these two old pros can do with their opportunities .
439312	1617546	26689	6.0	Warner	This one is another fast and fun example of Warner's B work in this period , timing in at 75 minutes , with the usual cast of supporting actors talking fast to get the words out . Guy Kibbee plays . . . well , a typical Guy Kibbee role , except he's not a dolt this time , and it's Aline McMahon , usually cast in the pre-codes as the gal who's seen it all and shows it , who plays his love interest - - he's a pressman whose wanderlust made him leave his family and head out over the world ten years before . Now he's back and trying to woo his wife . Of course the plot is not that simple . There's a bit of a political scandal in town and the rapprochement that's the heart of the story weaves its way in and out of that . There are the usual fine , now-forgotten supporting actors in this piece . Nan Gey , playing the elder daughter , is cute as a button , and Oscar Apfel , who taught Demille how to direct a movie , has for him a sizable role . It's not a great movie , but there is some real chemistry between Kibbee and McMahon . Definitely worth a look .
438902	1617546	19123	6.0	Good Comedy Western	Ted Wells was a late silent cowboy star , starring in some decent Hoot Gibson knockoffs when he made this comedy . He and Margery Bonner are in love but her aunt insists she marry either a society man or a hero , so his hands decide that he will be a made-to-order hero . . . . but society man Jack Pratt keeps getting the credit . Although Wells lacks the easy-going charm of Hoot Gibson , his stiffness is , if not a conscious acting choice , suited to this role . Westerns long remained one of the most conservative genres of movies , second only to trailers , and this one is no exception . Wells is often shown riding in irised shots , unusual outside of westerns by this period . Although this will not win new fans for silent B westerns , if you are interested in the genre and don't have access to any Hoot Gibson efforts , this one boasts a decent story and some fun titles .
438784	1617546	132179	7.0	I'm on the Bad Guy's Side	One of Melies ' super-productions , like VOYAGE A LA LUNE and LA ROYAUME DES FEES , this is a bit of fairy tale , about a minstrel who rescues his love from dungeon , with lots of sparklers , the usual wonderful Melies camera trickery and , in the print I was fortunate enough to see today , lots of hand-tinting . While Melies ' day was passing rapidly - - Gaumont and Pathe had caught up with him in camera trickery and , if they did not produce the lush looking background and foreground that Melies specialized in , they were large enough enterprises that they could take away his market - - and Melies ' film grammar always remained primitive : usually confined to the proscenium arch , his cutting rarely showed any of the sophistication discovered by George Smith in England and elaborated on by Zecca in France . Stiill , Melies was putting up a big fight against the competition , and this is an very enjoyable movie to watch . My only issue with it is that I am on the side of the Fee Carabosse - - the minstrel paid her , not with gold , but with sand !
438818	1617546	4475	7.0	Good , Standard Keystone	This Keystone from the end of 1914 , involving the usual suspects running around some plumbing issues will not hold many surprises for those familiar with Keystone in this period , or , indeed , with the works of the Three Stooges , who often played inept plumbers . It is , nonetheless , very nicely performed , especially by Charles Murray who mugs it up freely and ineptly , as well as the pretty girl who plays the house's maid . Although this will likely not make any new fans for Keystone or Mr . Murray , for those who are pleased by the field , it will , I feel confident , prove to be a superior effort as it takes potshots at all the classes . If you don't know much beyond Chaplin from this period , take a look .
439030	1617546	246564	7.0	Broad and enjoyable comedy	Gale Henry directs and stars in this amusing tale of an incompetent female detective set in " Chinatown " in 1918 ; a member of the local Tong has stolen a formula for glasses that will enable people to see what's in chop suey , and she is charged with recovering the plans . What results is sequence of puns and chases that won't strain anyone's mind , but will keep you smiling throughout .
439063	1617546	38992	7.0	Miscellany	Another delightful one-reeler from Pete Smith . We get to watch Lena Horne sing " Ain't It The Truth ? " in a bubble bath , watch some close-up sleight of hand exposed and see a three-year-old balance on knives while eating an apple , while Smith makes bemused comments . A lot of fun .
439266	1617546	45898	7.0	Rashomon Don't Care Either	The musical comedy biopic gets the Rashomon treatment in this faked-up biopic of Eva Tanguay , one of the great stars of turn-of-the-century vaudeville . Mitzi Gaynor , as always , gives a great performance and it's a pity that , with the exception of the movie version of SOUTH PACIFIC , she was always Fox's B musical star , doing whatever they gave her . The musical numbers are all overdone , as if choreographer Jack Cole is mocking the form ; the semi-strip-tease to jazzed up Mozart ( I'm not making this up ! It's the most out-of-place dance number outside of Sally Forrest's weird one in EXCUSE MY DUST ) and other numbers that recall LADY IN THE DARK - - all very modern for the era and absolutely bizarre in context . Oscar Levant plays the piano magnificently a few times and David Wayne gives a typically graceful performance in support .
438752	1617546	136313	7.0	Selling to the Theater Owner	This late silent Koko the Clown cartoon has Max pestered by an ink salesman , so he throws him through the door , whereupon Koko and Bimbo announce that if they were salesmen , they could sell anything to anyone , and so they do , to Scotchmen and scrubwomen . Although Fleischer had already made the move into sound cartoons - - they had been producing song cartoons for at least three years at this point - - the days of silent Koko were limited and the increased effort on backgrounding would not save them from having to move through to the next phase - - Koko just about vanishing and Bimbo reduced to support to Betty Boop . But the franchise still had some legs and this is a fine effort .
438417	1617546	59102	7.0	A Safe Bet	One of the strongest of the Pink Panther shorts , this succeeds by a series of gags on the same theme : a safe cracker attempting to break into a safe inside of which is the Pink Panther - - the panther itself , of course . It also is strengthened by not having the two problems of many of the Depatie-Freleng cartoons . It does not have actively ugly backgrounding - - the backgrounding , instead , is nondescript - - and it does not have a laugh track , so you can enjoy it on your own terms . What it does have is the Pink Panther , a character with little personality , That is a weakness of all of the series . A comedian without a personality may do funny things and make you laugh , but he is also replaceable by any other comedian . It is odd that the old pros who did these cartoons seem to have forgotten that , but there you have it .
438668	1617546	19760	7.0	A Little Perspective , Please	Given the effusion over CHELOVEK S KINOAPPARATOM in the commentary section of the IMDb , I expect this will be a tad out of place , but I feel that this is a very good , although not groundbreaking movie . First , what we have here is a portrait of a city - - Moscow , I believe , on the lines of MANHATTA and the more famous BERLIN : DIE SINFONIE DER GROSSTADT . It is an excellent example of the genre , with some beautiful camera-work but in no wise groundbreaking . The distinction , if any , lies in the use of the eponymous Man With a Movie Camera as a character in the film . People stop to gawk at movie cameras in operation at first sight , and Vertov must have been frustrated at some of the excellent footage he would have to throw away . Then it probably occurred to him that if he made the camera itself a character , the gawking could be explained . To Americans this might be strange , but silent European films often had the camera clearly comment on the action of the film - - check out Feuillade's serials , such as LES VAMPIRES for examples . This leaves open , of course , the issue of why , in several of the crowd scenes , in which we see the actor / cameraman from the rear , people are looking at the movie camera actually in use to take the shot . Could it be it is not the man with the movie camera they are looking at , but the operating camera ? This being Soviet cinema , we are also supposed to gawk over the editing technique , which the Soviets invented - - or actually , reported on , as they had been in use for up to thirty years by the time . The Soviet academicians got their stuff into print first - - elsewhere , people learned by experimentation or going to work for someone who knew what he was doing . Finally , although Soviet film in this period is vibrant and interesting and does have a lot of editing techniques that were influential , they were making good films in Russia before the Revolution . I urge anyone who is interested in Russian films to look up the works of Yevgeny Bauer or Starewicz . And take a look at this movie , by all means . It's very good . I apologize if anyone thinks I am complaining , but I worry that other commenters may have oversold it . Why not see it and make up your own mind ?
438874	1617546	299493	7.0	Love and Laughs	I must admit I am a sucker for Charley Chase's short silent comedies . They combine full , three-act stories , fine acting and strong comedy gags that arise out of believable situations . The modern movie goer , used to witty dialogue and color photography - - well , color photography anyway - - may lack the patience to penetrate into the subtleties of silent film acting and a camera that looks at the people instead of indulging in jumpy MTV-style cutting techniques , but Charley Chase cuts right through that . How can you not enjoy a comedy in which a man sets fire to his hat and falls in love in a rainstorm ? Charley is willing to do anything to his character to get a laugh and the girl , but he remains believable and sympathetic throughout . This comedy , although not from his best period , is still crammed full of amusing gags . This is probably not the movie to use to introduce people to Mr . Chase - - he is better served in silent efforts like LOOKING FOR SALLY and MIGHTY LIKE A MOOSE and sound efforts like THE PIP FROM PITTSBURGH . But once you've got the habit , you'll enjoy this one too .
438496	1617546	32398	7.0	By Cheating , of course	An early " cheater " , a cartoon put together by using clips from earlier cartoons with enough filler to make it a " new " picture . Of course , this being a Fleischer Popeye , it's funny and there are plenty of " Impossikible " stunts . A good introduction to Popeye .
438561	1617546	26379	7.0	Four Stars Out of Five	In an effort not to alienate his wife's wealthy aunt , newly-wed Charley must masquerade as a boarder in his own home while his wife pretends to be married to an old beau . Although not one of Chase's best comedies , there is no shortage of laughs in this outing for Charley . His long-suffering reaction to the frequently offered artichokes is a corker , and the matter-of-fact way in which he and his wife's old beau exchange places is also very funny . This likely won't win any new fans for Charley , but will please his current ones . See if you can spot Charley's real life mother , Polly in the cast - - I couldn't find anyone with enough family resemblance to be sure it was hers . It does raise the question of whether she approved of Charley's stage name : the real family name was Parrott , which Charley used to direct . But how comfortable could his mother been as Polly Parrott ?
438390	1617546	12940	7.0	The Mexican Army to the Rescue !	An excellent silent western starring the now unfortunately forgotten J . B . Warner . Told with good humor and interesting camerawork , we have Mr . Warner in love with a lovely Spanish senorita , his life saved by a jumping bean , then leading the Mexican army to rescue a woman from the Ku Klux Klan . Surviving prints are a bit dupy after eighty years , but it's still a pleasant effort and well worth your time .
439365	1617546	4991	7.0	A Seat on the Trolley	Another of the Mr . & Mrs . Sidney Drew movies , in which they take a small situational comedy and play it with great charm . In this , Mr . Drew is tired of having to give up his seat on the trolley to women with squalling brats , and so he buys a doll and passes it off as his own baby . This sequence is a lot of fun as Mr . Drew alternates between acting as if the doll is a real baby , and treating it as a mere inert prop - - and bystanders react to his cavalier behavior . Even the plot , which involves him trying to court Mrs . Drew - - they aren't married in the movie , you see - - when she believes him to be a married man with a baby - - is done in a realistic , convincing and funny way . It is a pity that a two-minute chunk of the film does is bubbled out of existence - - but so many of the many fine comedies they did no longer exist . If this one is available to you , don't miss the opportunity to see it .
438932	1617546	6809	7.0	Smile for the camera	A sprightly early Fairbanks film . Although too much of the story is told through intertitles , Douglas usual physical gags , including much building climbing and witty situations make for a good time . Look for Erich von Stroheim ( who was also an assistant director ) as a member of the Weazels Gang .
439278	1617546	144549	7.0	Not Chaplin	Despite the remarks of the other commenter on this movie , I see no resemblance to the Chaplin film of the same name except for the title . This is not a comedy about how Ko-ko hides his pay envelope from his wife , but how Ko-ko wants to get paid like everyone else at the office . " Only people who work get paid " says Max and draws Koko a scene where he can make little ones out of the big ones . . . . . but burglars appear , both in the cartoon and live action world . Is it my imagination or do I see a lot of tension between the Fleischer brother in this movie ? Max was the creator and co-star . . . . but Dave was the model for Ko-ko and the director . When the studio collapsed , two dozen years later , it was because the two of them were no longer on speaking terms . Were they already fighting when this was made ?
439013	1617546	224240	7.0	Religious FIlms	Having invented the trick film and the stag film ( with the same year's APRES LE BAL ) , Melies also pioneered the religious film , with this account of the temptation of St . Anthony , using the same sort of camera tricks he was using for his magic works . But I wonder : what was the placement order of his catalogue ? Did this come immediately after APRES LE BAL ? This is one of the many previously lost or infrequently seen Melies pictures that have been made available by Serge Bromberg , David Shepherd and a myriad of other hands in the newly issued DVD set GEORGES MELIES : FIRST WIZARD OF CINEMA . Required viewing for anyone interested in the history of movies . . . . . and a lot of fun .
438664	1617546	1118	7.0	Little Mary Is a Frump	This D . W . Griffith feature - - for 1910 , this 13-minute movie ranks as a feature - - manages to combine most of what Griffith had learned of film-making by the point , except for his handling of crowd scenes . Mary Pickford and company are excellent in this melodrama with comic overtones , from the ironic title - - there is nothing blithe about Mary's life as she suffers a life of hard work on a farm - - to the occasional gawkiness she displays when she is seduced by a hard-living traveling salesman . Finally , when she recognizes the situation she finds unsatisfactory solace in religion . The performances are a little slow to the modern eye , but fulsome . The camera work is wonderful , as you might expect from Billy Bitzer in this period . While this is not a key work , it is well worth the time of anyone interested in silent movies .
439398	1617546	25328	7.0	The Little King	One of half a dozen movie cartoon's based on Soglow's " Little King " panel comic strip . These are among the best cartoons that Van Beuren turned out . Soglow did the writing and the simple black & white drawing that was in favor at Van Beuren matches Soglow's style and the strip was silent , which works well . Unhappily , there are only a few of these and none are in color . Some of the jokes are standard cartoon jokes , but the good ones are about the Little King and his desire to not have to deal with the boring rituals of being royalty . Fortunately , there's always a hot dog vendor or mermaid around when you want one . . . .
439071	1617546	1245104	7.0	Tricks Are For Everyone	As any fan of Pixar's animated films know , when they send a new feature out , they include a short cartoon with it . PRESTO is the film that precedes WALL-E and it is a silent picture . A good part of the publicity surrounding WALL-E is that it is largely a silent film . But PRESTO is wholly one , concerning a stage magician , his carrot-hungry rabbit and a piece of real magic : a top-hot that is connected to a dunce cap . The magician can put his hand into the top hat and draw out things from the dunce cap . And , as is traditional , he intends to pull out the rabbit , but the rabbit , who resembles the rabbit in the TRIX cereal commercials , is upset that he is not getting any carrot , and sabotages the act in various amusing ways using the logic of the set-up . A very amusing cartoon , and Pixar is to be commended for continuing to develop animation talent in its short subjects .
438741	1617546	49037	7.0	Amusing Novelty	I've enjoyed some pretty strange musical novelty acts over the years , from the South Minneapolis Bassoon Quartet to Peter Schickele's annual presentation of P . D . Q . Bach , but this short about an all-harmonica orchestra , is a pip ! Dozens of harmonicas from tiny ones that a baby could swallow through triplex monsters a foot in length provide a lot of variation and a surprisingly full sound . Visually , director Negulesco shows his usual flair , filling the numbers with blackout productions and a snappy dance to " Begin the Beguine " - - no Artie Shaw , but quite good . and a lot of his signature silhouette shots . Also , notice the way he takes care to shoot the harmonicas to emphasize hand movements .
438364	1617546	142088	7.0	The Country and the Story	Andre Antoine filmed his silent version of Daudet's work with the sense of awe at the beauty of the city of Arles and the countryside surrounding it that you would expect if you have already seen his LA TERRE . He also slides us into the story in an ingenious manner : here is the a picture of Daudet who wrote it , and here is the mill he lived in where he wrote it , and here is Arles , and the river that runs through it and the farms near it and the person who lives on a farm , played by the actress . . . . and we are in the story . It is the telling of that story , though , I have issues with . It is a story of people and their thoughts and their words , and this is a silent movie . . . . and so takes a lot longer to do than a stage play . And so characters and subplots need to be cut , but Antoine is - - understandably - - loathe to cut them . And so we have the subplot of the shepherd and his lost love raised . . . . and dropped . We have characters who don't serve any purpose , not even the exposition of the character from the original , since their screen time is cut so severely . This is always a problem in the translation of a work of art from one medium to another . A movie is not a novel , a movie is not a play , a movie isn't a poem . Heck , a movie isn't a movie any more : they have sound and color and computerized special effects and even the caterer rates a screen credit . But the problem of translation from one medium to another remains : not only how to translate these words to images - - and Antoine does a superb job of that - - but which words to translate . Here he falls down a bit . Like any fan , he doesn't want to give up any of it , but as a responsible movie maker he knows he must - - and he leaves in just enough to tell us that what we are seeing is not a complete work of art . He belittles own work by not doing a neat job of work , so how seriously can we take it ? Well , there are some lovely images . Enjoy it for that .
439097	1617546	242849	8.0	Evolution	Although D . W . Griffith is usually honored as the inventor of modern film grammar , most of the groundwork was laid down a decade earlier by George Smith of England . This is one of his early films . But even this particular Athena did not spring fully born from the mind of Zeus , and we can see that Smith is using a lot of magic lantern grammar - - the children dream of Santa and he appears in a small circular image in the upper right corner , straight out of the preceding technology's grammar . This particular technique would not vanish for another decade and a half - - and arguably is still in occasional use in such peculiarities as SHERLOCK JUNIOR and its successor THE PURPLE ROSE OF CAIRO as well as Jeunet's UN LONG DIMANCHE DE FIANCAILLES . Another point of interest is the title of this movie . Although Clement Clarke Moore's poem , ' A Visit from Saint Nick ' was well known and popular , it's a Dutch and New York and hence American phenomenon . What was an Englishman , with their Father Christmas , doing playing with the idea ? It seems to me that Smith may have been a far more important figure in popular culture than even I thought .
438771	1617546	43812	8.0	Strong Cast of Unknowns Helps Good Crawford Programmer	The title of this review says it all . In 1951 , who knew who Ernest Borgnine , Richard Kiley and Charles Buchinsky were ? But in this Columbia noir , made after Broderick Crawford became an unlikely star because of ALL THE KING'S MEN has the lead going undercover to investigate racketeering on the docks , we see how good actors can overcome a basically decent script overloaded with ' snappy ' dialog , cheap sets and unexceptional directing . The actors are , frankly , amazing and this is as good as a movie can get with a major flaw like this - - ace DP Joseph Walker can't do much with the studio sets and back projection , but he makes a good effort with a highly mobile camera .
438455	1617546	151935	8.0	The Pen is Mightier Than The Sword	One of the best of Van Beuren's " Tom & Jerry " series in which they pull out a pencil and proceed to draw figures in the air which join the action : an early prefigurement , if you like , of Chuck Jones ' classic DUCK AMUCK . Van Beuren was one of the cartoon factories that flourished from about 1925-1936 . It released through RKO and went under shortly after RKO dropped its contract in favor of one with Disney . Although never the best of studios , its staff worked hard . Probably its best black and white series was " Tom & Jerry " a Mutt and Jeff combo that , like Fleischer's Betty Boop , started as cartoon dogs and evolved into a music-backed series . Disguised in rerelease from Official Films as ' Dick and Larry ' to avoid confusion with MGM's cat-and-mouse duo , a lot of their shorts have survived . A lot of their jokes are out of favor , but some are very amusing and if you wish to give them a try , this and PIANO TOONERS are good places to start .
438727	1617546	1285239	8.0	What We Do For Others We Do For Ourselves	This is an excellent and heartfelt Hallmark TV movie about a workaholic whose personal life has collapsed around him , who organizes and leads a Christmas choir of men living at a homeless shelter . Working my way through this intellectually , I find a lot of flaws in this picture : its episodic nature , its easy internal parallels , the cleanliness of everything and so forth , but the simplicity of the actors ' performances work beautifully . There are almost no big names involved in this production - - the closest to one is probably Rhea Perlman , who plays the cranky nun who runs the shelter . But it doesn't really matter . Very much worth your while .
438666	1617546	22560	8.0	The Masquers	This short is one of four of the shorts produced by the Masquers Club and distributed by RKO in the early 1930s , now available on DVD from Encore Home Video . This wild burlesque of westerns , directed by Arthur Rosson stars Ned Sparks in his usual frozen-faced performance , as the sheriff , Antonio Moreno as the Mexican bandit - - sort of - - and a host of silent comics and straight performers . It uses every cliche in the book to comic effect and throws in lots of gags while remaining a well-directed and photographed movie . If you love silent movies , slapstick comedy or playing ' spot the star ' this one will be a real treat for you .
438534	1617546	22724	8.0	Al St . John Underacts !	He screams , he rants , he pulls at his hair , he throws a radio through a wall and dives after it . For Al St . John this is underacting . He was one of the best fall takers in the industry , ranking with Buster Keaton and Lupino Lane , but his idea of acting was to behave like an agile toddler throwing a tantrum . After looking at a sizable portion of his more than two hundred movies over the forty years he spent in the industry , from BANGVILLE POLICE in 1913 to THE BLACK LASH in 1952 - - comic sidekick to Lash LaRue ( Yes , there was an actor who went by that name ) - - I must say that it's also pretty funny for once , because what is he screaming , ranting etc . about ? His wife has been playing contract bridge for three months and the dirty dishes are piling up . This is a very well-made comedy short , directed by Al's uncle , Roscoe Arbuckle under his pseudonym of William Goodrich . The gags are well done and the editing is also carefully handled . Although I strongly dislike Mr . St . John's performances , this is one funny short .
438481	1617546	370634	8.0	Simple and Funny	This Powers Universal Comedy from 1912 has a very simple premise : a family is going to have the pictures of the two youngsters , a boy and a girl , taken by a photographer . Nothing bizarre takes place , there are no unusual gags , yet this is a very funny comedy : the children torment each other - - and the photographer - - in a highly naturalistic manner . As Mel Brooks has noted , if I cut my finger that's tragedy . If you fall into a manhole and die , that's comedy . Although no one dies in this one , it is comedy . Very little is known about this film besides its release date ( listed as May 12 , 1913 in the Slapsticon 3 ( 2005 ) program book . If the opportunity comes around for you to see it , take a few minutes to do so .
438716	1617546	18266	9.0	A Puzzling Failure	This movie was a fairly famous failure in its day , cut down afterward to a great two-reeler , CHASING CHOO-CHOOS . Many reasons have been offered as to why it failed - - mostly pacing issues - - but taking a look at it , it doesn't wash . It is a well-constructed movie , the gags are funny and heartfelt all the way through , and it doesn't sag in the middle . It is , in short , well worth your time . So why did it fail ? I was struck with one possibility : there was no shortage of good slapstick features in this period , with the leads great comics : Chaplin , Keaton , Lloyd , Raymond Griffith at Paramount . . . . and certainly Keaton was having trouble turning out money-making features . And the four I named were not only top comics , they were also good-looking men too . Looking at Banks in this movie , one is struck by the fact that he looks like an ordinary fellow , obviously Italian , and one , perhaps , who could afford to cut down on the pasta . Whatever its reasons for failure at the time , they don't apply now . If you get a chance to see this , as a cut-down short or in its original released length , don't pass it up .
438789	1617546	118001	9.0	Pure Westlake : Comedy of Depression	A great adaptation of one of Donald Westlake's sad-sack comedies , in this case about Antonio Banderas , an unsuccessful art gallery owner who ekes out his income by a variation on the Bible Salesman scam . He winds up engaged to a funny , screeching Melanie Griffith , in lust with her sister - - and Melanie's gangster ex-husband is after him . This won't be to everyone's taste : Westlake's humor is a lot like Tim Burton's and it's a shame Burton has never tried his hand at one of Westlake's novels . None of the screen adaptations of his works have served him well , although the hard-to-find HOT STUFF , from his own script works well . But this is about as good as it gets , with a perfect supporting cast , including Eli Wallach , Darryl Hanna , Danny Aiello and the woman who can make you laugh while she's having a nervous breakdown : Joan Cusack . Give this a try . And if you know Tim Burton , suggest he try a Dortmunder novel or two .
438871	1617546	234111	9.0	An Understandable Failure	Porter's last follow up to LIFE OF AN American FIREMAN is a much better movie with a better sense of story and a definite sense of something to say about what a policeman does . However , while it does have its moments of excitement , like rescuing a drowning woman or overtaking a runaway horse , it lacks the big set piece fire that make the most of the earlier movie . Instead , POLICEMAN offers us a study of individuals who have families like you and me and stand ready to deal with whatever emergencies pop up - - and pop up , they do . If it weren't for Porter's careful attention to continuity , this might have resulted in an episodic mess . It does not . Yet , even so , the calm of the policemen , their ability to deal with the crises as they turn up , make them less exciting . And that is probably why FIREMAN was a hit and this movie was a flop , despite four years of enormous advances in cinematic technique - - that and the fact that the people who made up nickelodeon audiences did not look upon policemen as their friends . This does remain an interesting piece that shows the advances in technique that were occurring at the time . Give this one a look , right after FIREMAN if you can .
439383	1617546	935076	9.0	Real Gone	Before commenting on this episode series , I should warn you : apparently only two of these survive in any real form and I've only seen one of them - - Episode Two , titled , appropriately enough , ' Round Two ' , so my comments may or may not be of much use . Well , here goes . This is great . It was made by a bunch of people who had never made films before and they do some very interesting things : Reginald Denny , at the very start of his career , played Americans in the movies - - his accent being inaudible in the silents . Here he plays an ex-college athlete whose father has gone broke , so he must make a living as a prizefighter ; and his manager is a nice enough guy , but he likes to get into crap games and make unhappy wagers . . . . . so things are at a low point . There are three points I wish to call to your attention , in case you ever get to see this movie - - and it is available now on DVD . First , the characters rather breezily break the fourth wall - - the manager stops the action early on to fill in newcomers as to What Has Gone Before - - a delightful bit of informality . Second , the people involved have managed to install into this movie some of the real grunge of boxing gyms , something that seems to have been missed by everyone except Robert Wise in THE SET-UP ( 1949 ) and Clint Eastwood in MILLION DOLLAR BABY ( 2004 ) . THat's a long time between authentic grunge , but somehow almost every film maker seems to have missed the low characters and low settings that a boxing gym has , and the marginal characters who can waver between low comedy and pathos . And the story is told in a brisk and interesting fashion by people who seem to not to know that you can't do things that way in the movies - - and it works when they do it . In case I'm being obscure , highly recommended . It is available on DVD from reelclassicdvd . com - - go to the web site and poke around . The proprietor , Mark Roth , informs me he's going to releasing another episode on DVD soon .
439316	1617546	154637	9.0	Oh , the Places You'll Go	This is one of the best of the wartime ' Private Snafu ' films made by Termite Terrace , usually written by Theodore Geisel ( aka Dr . Seuss ) . Because they were intended only for soldiers , they were usually far more open and frank than movies intended for civilian showings and concerned themselves with humorously designed warnings about how to behave In this case , the movie is about being stationed in the Aleutians and their strategic importance in the war . A fine light curtain raiser if you're looking at a deep-dish world War two movie - - or perhaps as a treat before seeing John Ford's masterpiece , SEX HYGIENE ( both available on Youtube ) .
438676	1617546	228447	9.0	Variations on a Theme : the Little Match Girl	Another of Melies dreams of an easier life as a poor chimney sweep - - recall if you will , that this dirty and dangerous task was performed by children who could fit into cramped , sooty chimneys - - falls asleep and dreams he is clean , caparisoned in rich clothes and seated on a throne , where officers and courtiers dance for his delight . Melies ' subtext is not at all subtle here , but it is no less powerful a plea for an end to child labor for that . A clear example of the fact that fantasy allows us to examine those issues which straight fiction is too harsh or nuanced for clarity . This is one of the many previously lost or infrequently seen Melies pictures that have been made available by Serge Bromberg , David Shepherd and a myriad of other hands in the newly issued DVD set GEORGES MELIES : FIRST WIZARD OF CINEMA . Required viewing for anyone interested in the history of movies . . . . . and a lot of fun .
439189	1617546	16651	9.0	Mutt and Jeff	Mutt and Jeff never displayed much personality in the movies . They were , like many comedians of the silent era , two guys who did funny things and slowly faded away . Pairs like Laurel & Hardy were much more durable because they had actual personalities . Nevertheless . . . Nevertheless , this is the single best Mutt & Jeff cartoon I have seen . The drawing and animation are much fuller than they are for most cartoons of this era , and the jokes sharper and bordering on the absurd : enough to make you burst out laughing . Credit long-time director Charlie Bowers , who was just about the break the confines of the animation studios with his mixed media masterpieces such as A WILD ROOMER , NOW YOU TELL ONE and GOOFY BIRDS . You can see his cartoon sensibilities start up here if you've run out of those .
439247	1617546	40262	9.0	Daffy at his most annoying . . .	We have here Daffy being as obnoxious as he can be as he tortures Porky Pig , with whom he is sharing a room . This is an early McKimson , and one of his best . In a couple of years , Chuck Jones would take Daffy and remold his personality , but here we see a fine mechanical rendition of the little black duck .
439505	1617546	149790	10.0	Better But as Funny ?	This was the first appearance of the redesigned Woody Woodpecker , intended to make him more appealing - - no buckteeth . The ongoing competition to turn out the best short cartoons in the business were still on . The Fleischers were out of it , Paul Terry was idling at Fox with his guaranteed contracts , and Disney was distracted by features and the aftermath of a strike . Meanwhile , Tex Avery was being given a free hand at MGM , and Schlesinger had just sold his cartoon factory to Warner Brothers . But to turn out the best cartoons you needed a good character and good scripts . Lantz could buy talent , particularly talent eager to escape from Uncle Walt , but what about stars ? A brief attempt to revive Oswald the Lucky Rabbit turned out too precious to stomach . Andy Panda was too bland and Wally Walrus was a good supporting comic , but nothing more . Woody Woodpecker had color , energy and sound . All he needed was a new look and a couple of vehicles to show him off to best advantage . And that's this movie . Seamus Culhane was an old hand in the field - - he'd been directing cartoons since 1930 , and he directed this one for speed and energy , splitting Woody into five or six images at some points . The whole thing explodes off the screen and is a fine , funny cartoon . Plus it's a wonderful handling of the music from ' The Barber of Seville ' .
438802	1617546	256205	10.0	To where ?	Surprisingly funny , dreamy little comedy as down-on-his-luck Ham looks for work , gets thrown out of his rooming house and tries to make it on the street - - in the best , gag-filled 20s comedy style . Ignore the early Ham and Bud comedies : this one really works as Ham sourly tries to make the best of things , despite the ubiquitous cops , with their threatening orders to " move along . "
438459	1617546	232902	10.0	Great Documentary & Great Music	An early and wonderful example of what tv can do when it sets itself to do something good . Stuff like this is now all over the History Channel , but you can't do better than Richard Rodger's music for this . Worth it for the score alone .
439390	1617546	37557	10.0	We're in the Money	Alan Dwan was sent out in 1911 to find a missing film crew . According to the story , the director was out on a bender and he cabled the home office " You have no director . Suggest you disband company . " Back came a telegram saying " You direct . " With this telegram he went to the crew and said " Either I'm a director or you're out of a job . " " You're the best director we ever saw ! " And direct he did for the next fifty years , sometimes shorts , sometimes prime features with Douglas Fairbanks Sr . and often in the Bs , but always doing his best . This is one of his best Bs , based on a story written by George Barr McCutcheon , which he wrote under a pen name to prove he could write a best-seller without depending on his name to sell it . It was a best seller . The stage play that this movie was based on was also a hit , and this farce , directed at top speed with a great cast . If it ever shows up anywhere you can reach it , go to see it .
438583	1617546	936	10.0	Moods	There isn't much of a story here . A sailor promises to wed the girl who loves him , then goes away to other ports and forgets about her while she waits . When he finally returns , she has fallen ill and is dying and he pretends he has come back to marry her , to make her last few minutes happier . What makes this piece so very interesting is the way Griffith has it photographed . The outdoor scenes show huddled masses of beached boats , set to make a constrained circle of safety around the sailors ; another shows Kate Bruce , her hair streaming in the wind , while the waves roll moodily to the right . He ends scenes with slow fades to black . This is not so much one of his story films as an exercise in poetry , and he knows how to make the silent cinema sing .
438787	1617546	10600	10.0	Oh , You Beautiful Doll	People speak of the Lubitsch Touch first showing up in THE OYSTER PRINCESS , but that movie always struck me me as a a good romantic comedy , dimmed by changes in fashion , creaking a bit in age . But this movie is the real thing : a silly story told with much flair and constant surprises . It begins with Lubitsch showing you a model of the set , like Penn and Teller showing you how they do the cup-and-ball trick , followed by a show that dazzles you : pantomime horses , venal monks and a little bit of E . T . A . Hoffman all fall under the thrall of Lubitsch and all of them , and the audience too , end up with smiles on their faces . This movie is too good to more than hint at its wonders . If you have never seen a silent feature , see this one .
439451	1617546	339444	10.0	Dippy Doctors	Hilarious , chaotic burlesque musical short features Billy Gilbert as a German doctor in search of a missing watch . Such touches as cheering sections at operations and musical numbers at " Olivia from Bolivia " . Impeccable timing makes this a not-to-be-missed short .
439112	1617546	150832	10.0	No ham in the sandwich	Hilarious ! Joe and his partner are desperate to break into show business - - but no one can be this desperate ! They find themselves out in the boondocks . " You open the show " " We don't open any shows . " " All right , you close the show . " " I think we are the show ! " With Billy Gilbert as the dyspeptic stage manager , it's a good thing the only audience is the janitor .
438638	1617546	24775	10.0	Spanky the Star !	A somewhat atypical OUR GANG comedy . The focus is not on the interaction of the gang , but concerns itself with Franklin Pangborn's tribulations in taking a portrait photo of Spanky . Spanky gets to sock Pangborn frequently and hilariously . Look for a quick cameo by Laurel and Hardy .
438685	1617546	222729	10.0	The Magic Act	Melies is best known for his 1902 version of VOYAgE DANs LA LUNE and he worked in an enormous variety of genres - - today we would call them genres , but at the time , he was just turning out stuff to fill in at his theater and to sell to people who wanted to show movies . But he began as a stage magician and although he incorporated stage magic into his films and invented cinematic magic via cuts , masking and other method , he remained a magician to the end and this film , about two minutes in length , is the best pure example of stage magic in his surviving films . Yes , there are lots of camera tricks , but it comes out as stage magic . And , looking at recent movies about stage magicians , like THE PRESTIEGE , you begin to see how much presence the role requires - - and he has it . This is one of the many previously lost or infrequently seen Melies pictures that have been made available by Serge Bromberg , David Shepherd and a myriad of other hands in the newly issued DVD set GEORGES MELIES : FIRST WIZARD OF CINEMA . Required viewing for anyone interested in the history of movies . . . . . and a lot of fun .
438735	1617546	145790	10.0	Statues Just Wanna Have Fun	The Greek legend of Pygmalion and Galatea get the Lotte Reininger silhouette treatment in this lovely and funny adaptation of the old Greek myth . Pygmalion falls in love with his statue of a beautiful woman and his prayers are answered : she becomes a live woman - - in this case she transforms from part of the painted background into one of Reininger's silhouette figures . But Pygmalion , who has conventional ideas of how women should behave , finds that his creation has different ideas of what she wants . . . . Lotte Reininger's silhouettes may be difficult to follow , since the aesthetics involved are different from standard movies : but the beauties of her details and her sense of humor should be enough to draw you in , should you be fortunate enough to see them .
439241	1617546	90671	10.0	Jean Gabin Is Dead	And therefore , says Jean Yann's character , they can't make gangster flicks anymore . Except that Claude Lelouch can , in his own , slow , deliberate , quirky way . He introduces you to the principals over the course of ten years and punctuates the movie with all the set pieces except for the big robbery : that happens before the start of the picture and sets off the entire course of events , including a double murder , a lesson on the ethnology of Brazil , betrayal , an exclusive girl's school in Switzerland , the funniest prison escape in the history of the movies - - be sure to read the stickers - - and , of course , an equestrian competition . An amazing mix of genres that keeps moving right along .
