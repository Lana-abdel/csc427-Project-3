438587	1617546	306032	1.0	Sheesh !	I didn't know whether to give a 1 or a 10 to this short subject . It's so rotten it comes out on the other side as vastly entertaining . What the hey ! Miss New York only came in second , so I'll give it a 1 . David Selznick made this film for quick cash at the height of the Valentino craze and there are a lot more shots of Mr . Valentino than of the 88 women in this beauty pageant . Yes , that's what it is , a beauty pageant , with title cards that are meant to be witty , but come off sounding insane . This was the era of ballyhoo , after all , when you could become world famous for sitting on a flagpole . Not at all like our sober age . So you have Valentino , 88 pretty girls and New York City . What more could you want ?
438524	1617546	232267	1.0	Where ?	Once again , Mr . James White , famous for his views of the backs of people's hats , has turned his camera to a fascinating subject , to wit : what do the railroad tracks look like from a moving train , when the train is moving past beautiful scenery . Well , they look like railroad tracks . That's a load off my mind and , I'm sure , yours .
438505	1617546	119414	1.0	The boredom of boredom is boring	And so is this movie . Joe - - at least we think it's Joe , since we're never actually told his name , or , indeed anything , since there is no dialogue - - lives a boring life in a boring place . We get to watch him clean his shoes a lot . He also goes into what appears to be a lobby and sits , staring at something , apparently a television . This happens forty-seven billion times . Now , how is anyone supposed to be interested in watching this , even for ten seconds ? We don't watch it for ten seconds , however . We get to watch it for ten minutes , unless you take my advice and don't look at it at all . I suppose this is art . It did , after all , have the distinction of being an official selection of the Cannes Film Festival . The liner notes from the DVD it appears on , the third disk of a Warner Brothers short subjects compilation disk issued in 2001 , notes that it takes place in a mental institution " where the trivial becomes monumental . " Or perhaps it's Cannes . Oh , yes , there's lots of repetitious harmonica music .
439230	1617546	368384	1.0	It's All Symbolic	Yes , even the symbols are symbolic . What are they symbolic of ? Why , that is for you , the viewer to decide . What does this movie mean to you ? An utter waste of six minutes ? Then clearly , this movie was not meant for you . Why did you look at it ? Go look at something else .
438872	1617546	215573	2.0	Wrong Composition	As usual , Messrs . White and Heisse , the originators of the bad school of film making , have demonstrated in this film that they know nothing about composition . The train approaches the onlookers and the camera straight on and the right hand of the frame is wasted until the last moment of this film . Bad camera placement would be their stock in trade throughout their careers . Although I have blamed Mr . White for this habit in other reviews , the new EDISON : THE MOVIES BEGIN set of dvds from Kino credit the pair of them for many of the bad movies I have held Mr . White solely responsible for . As a final note , the movie going public of 1897 was , undoubtedly , aware of this failure . These actualities brought distant scenes to people who might never otherwise have seen them . And yet , considering that movies were in a slump during this period hardly seems coincidental to me . The audience may not have been consciously aware of this , but they stayed away in droves . And artists and photographers knew all about composition in this period .
438631	1617546	1103224	2.0	The Brains of a Dope	A married trapper wins the heart of an Indian maid and is married to her . After the wedding night he returns to his other wife and family . The Indian discovers this bigamy and determines to kill him , but seeing the love he has for her daughter , she jumps off a cliff instead , hoping to meet again in the " Happy Hunting Ground . " That silly plot sums up the basic problem of this movie , which survives in an excellent tinted print . The exteriors , shot in Fort Lee New Jersey , are fine . The interiors are clearly flats . Besides the problems with the plot , the acting , while clearly Griffith-influenced - - by this stage , what American film was not ? - - is broad to just shy of comedy ; and the direction has a fairly long sequence in which the trapper comes home and cuddles his his daughter and neither of them mention the Indian in the room , even though the daughter fully knows she is there .
438565	1617546	26486	2.0	Syrupy	A treacly Happy Harmonies cartoon from Rudolf Ising as a bunch of childish , anthropomorphic bees spend their time , when they are not making honey , in cavorting with each other around Disney-fied mushrooms , until a big black spider with pink spots threatens their idyllic existence . This is one of those cartoons that exists only to be made fun of , and when Tex Avery showed up at MGM in the early 1940s , he skewered the entire genre with the opening to his first Screwy Squirrel movie . Scott Bradley's music is right in there . Although he would become the second best conductor of cartoon music when working for Hanna , Barbera and Avery in the 1940s , he gave ' em what they asked for with close harmony and variations on " Flight of the Bumblebee " . Of more historical interest is that the early sections in the honey . . . . well , call it factory - - looks a lot like the beauty shop scenes in the 1939 WIZARD OF OZ . I suppose that's what they thought the kiddies wanted . The dopes .
439219	1617546	840305	2.0	Showing My Age	The Comedy Central Roast of William Shatner is a long series of unfunny comedians who are more interested in seeing if they can drive anyone off stage than in actually saying or doing anything that can be remotely construed as funny . Now , a Roast is not meant to be polite . A roast can and should run the gamut from rough to appalling . But watching Andy Dick trying to gross out everyone by running his tongue over anyone who would hold still for it is not funny . Watching Farrah Fawcett try to get through her canned jokes without breaking up is not funny . As for Lisa Lamparelli , her best line was noting that her career was dead , but she could still get a gig on Comedy Central doing roasts . Indeed she can , so long as there is no requirement that she be funny . Nor do any of these ' comedy ' bits have anything to do with William Shatner . There is much about William Shatner's career that could have served a roast well : Shatner's egotism , his spreading waistline , his propensity for overacting . Yet no one was terribly interested in the subject of William Shatner . Largely , the ' comedians ' were interested in themselves and the apparent belief that all transgressive behavior is funny . Most of the barbs consisted of " You're fat and have no talent , William Shatner , now I'm going to vomit on the stage , and I love you , Bill . " The one good routine starts the show , with a rcorded ' telephone conversation ' between Shatner and Leonard Nimony , in which Shatner urges Nimoy to show up , saying it will be fun , and Nimoy saying ' Don't do it . ' My hope that , after an amusing start , something good would turn up some time in the proceedings was never justified for more than fifteen seconds . Nimoy's routine , alas was correct . Shatner stayed for the entire show . Don't you .

The view is varied somewhat by occasional glimpses of buildings , warehouses in the early sections and at the end of this two-minute film , ten seconds of the buildings surrounding the Champs de Mars .
438361	1617546	142635	3.0	Failures of Screen Writing	Andre Antoine liked to shoot screen adaptations of popular French novels , preferably about country life . His movies are always beautifully shot with a love of country life that borders on idolatry . A major weakness of his movies - - and this one in particular - - is that he seemed to so love the works he based his movies on that he hated to cut anything , resulting in aborted subplots , characters who disappear and whose actions seem totally unmotivated . Sandeau's novel is Dickensian in scope and characters , with elements that suggest A TALE OF TWO CITIES and BLEAK HOUSE , But Antoine is so intent on showing us the setup that he spends an entire reel on a Highlights of History lesson . Then the remainder of the movie is actuated by characters for no clear reason whatsoever : the lawyer who wants Stamply to throw out the Marquis , then advises the Marquis to marry his daughter to Stamply . . . . why ? Stamply , who believes the lawyer when he says one thing and then Hélène when she tells him otherwise ; Baronne de Vaubert , who sends her son to Paris for no reason other than to get him out of the way while Stamply woos his fiancée , then suddenly orders him back ; the Marquis who will do anything to keep his estate , and then suddenly won't . . . Well , it just goes on and on . It makes sense in the novel , but not here . Avoid this one .

After the paperwork is done , the psychiatrist says " I'm going to show you ink blots . Tell me what you see in them .

" On seeing the third , he says " I see two men having sex . " On seeing the next one , he says " I see two men and two women having sex . " The psychiatrist puts down the the inkblots . " So , " he says , " We'll start by discussing your monomania . " " MY monomania ? " says the guy . " And you with all these dirty pictures ! " That's how this movie strikes me .
438498	1617546	23696	4.0	Tight budget	Walt Disney was having some problems getting paid by his distributor in this period . Eventually he would leave United Artists and settle in for the next twenty years at RKO . In the meantime , however , he would cut corners on his movies by having a lot of repetitive movements in some of his shorts . Here he tries to make use of the fact that many musical phrases repeat and that the supporting action could logically repeat . Still , the sharp-eyed viewer will notice it . In the midst of this , Pinto Colvig's voicing of the early Goofy ( who had been introduced , in slightly different form in MICKEY'S REVUE the previous year ) is a welcome touch . His manic laugh never quite repeats itself and adds a touch of novelty to every shot .
438605	1617546	57122	4.0	End of the Line	Veteran MGM B director Roy Rowland ended his career with three cheap westerns co-produced with MGM and shot in Spain . In some ways this looks like one of the gritty westerns that were being turned out by Italy , but while the body count is adequate , Rowland was too steeped in the MGM mystique - - this movie is too visually polite , the music score a tad too lush and the actors too clean to compare with Sergio Leone's ' Man With No Name ' , so the result is nothing particular : too pretty for grit , too gritty for a traditional B and even a script co-written by Borden Chase can't do much . The actors try to do something with their performances , particularly Alex Nicol , but his character lacks enough definition to be particularly interesting . Director Rowland's son , Steve has a featured role as ' The Kid ' . One wonders how he felt about that during the shoot .
438538	1617546	148688	4.0	End of the Line	The last Chilly Willy release has him and the polar bear in an environmentalist fight between a man on an icebreaker who wants to drill an oil well in the arctic . The point of the movie is admirable , although , understandably in a short cartoon aimed at children , hardly balanced ; certainly few adults make serious efforts to be balanced in their positions . The animation is , for the era fairly good , although the story is limited to a few relatively unadorned efforts at mutual destruction . Although Chilly Willy was never a great cartoon character , this was the end of the line for Lantz and a weak , although serious coda to a long and happy career .
439256	1617546	16573	4.0	The Deuce you Say !	An unintentionally hilarious comedy-mystery-western of how Hoxie's family is being murdered by the evil MacGill family in a range war : Hoxie is trying to figure out who is killing off his relatives and pinning a playing card to the corpses with , apparently , never a thought as to motivation . Of course Hoxie and the chief MacGill's pretty niece fall in love with each other . The deliberate humor in this one involves a small white dog biting people , and the niece whacking people on the head with a frying pan . Hoxie's horse seems to have a bored expression on his face during the medium shots . Perhaps I'm projecting .
438848	1617546	168022	4.0	Driving Miss Daisy Mad	I first must note special interest : I do not like ' comedies ' in which animals are mistreated for the audience's amusement : Jules White & Zion Meyers ' DOGVILLE series for MGM fills me with horror . But chimpanzees are human enough and social enough that using them as performers does not disturb me and I have some fond members of the Marquis Chimps on television when I was a child . In this one , Snooky is the chauffeur for a family - - the family's children are played by the unknown child actors of A TRAY FULL OF TROUBLE . He is fired for smoking on the job and heads off , where he succors some scampish children who have fallen afoul of a gypsy . The Snooky starring vehicles are essentially novelty acts . Snooky dresses in clothes , has conversations with people via titles and even has a sidekick in this one - - a small dog that looks to be part toy poodle . But the humor is very primitive , suitable for very young children with no discrimination , the plot is melodramatic and the titles are enlivened only by low puns . I don't care for them . How about you ?
439403	1617546	38379	4.0	Awwwww . . .	A barefoot orphan and his faithful basset hound meet up with a folksy Harry Davenport in this manipulative short from Leroy Prinz , who should have stuck to dance numbers . Not recommended to anyone who doesn't have a good supply of insulin on hand .
438747	1617546	347063	4.0	Men are Such Clowns	This is an example of one of the most unusual techniques in film making , the silhouette play . The best known examples are the animations of Lotte Reininger , whose feature - - arguably the first animated feature , DIE ABENTUR DIE PRINZ ACHMED - - is available on DVD for those interesting . Although the technique often gives a great sense of intimacy it does not work very well here for my taste . One reason is the broad bawdiness of the subject as Pierrette cuckolds Pierrot with another clown . The other is the reduction of the characters to classical types of ballet , which is largely foreign to my sensibilities . The air of unreality imposed by these factors make the intimacy of the silhouette technique incongruous .
438570	1617546	44449	4.0	Napoleonic Zenda	The senior Dumas ' novel is turned into a knockoff of THE PRISONER OF ZENDA - - although as I have never read this Dumas novel , it may simply be returning the compliment . Director Karlson is not able to raise much of a performance from anyone except from Anthony Quinn , who plays his slimily villainous role with the appropriate cool aplomb . Still and all , besides the pleasures of Anthony-Quinn-watching , Karlson does manage to shoot the entire procedure with a goodly amount of visual beauty , with an MGM-style sumptuousness well displayed . Aside from these two point , however , this one is pretty much a washout .
438669	1617546	37040	5.0	Double Talk	This middling entry in MGM's answer to Warner's Torchy Blaine series has Maisie going to Reno , getting involved in a mystery surrounding a divorcing couple . It is a rather dull entry , the result of an uninvolving script and bland characterizations . Harry Beaumont , one of MGM's longtime B directors , does his best with the visual story telling , but even Anne Southern , aided and abetted by some up-and-coming players like Ava Gardner and John Hodiak can't do much with the story but talk fast . MGM , once Thalberg was dead , never quite knew what to do with unglamorous characters and a smattering of 40s jive talk dates the story and gives an infantile air to the entire operation . For completest of the talent involved , but if you miss this , you won't suffer .
438454	1617546	35134	5.0	Clark Gable manqué	This B movie remake of MANHATTAN MELODRAMA set in the Yukon was the one of the salvos that MGM fired in its attempt to use James Craig as a replacement for Gable while the King of Hollywood was at war . Craig is pretty good at the Gable role and there is a pretty good supporting cast , including Keenan Wynn , Jack Holt and particularly John Carradine as a crooked gambler . The problem is that Patricia Dane in the female lead is pretty stiff trying to play her role like Myrna Loy and William Lundigan , although competent , brings not a hint of the sparkle that William Powell did to his performance . Nor does director Joseph Newman take advantage of the nominally outdoor nature of the big finale . Everyone moves as if they are on a sound stage and the ending is abrupt . Perhaps it comes down to the fact that Newman did not serve the material as well as might be hoped .
438982	1617546	33279	5.0	Fast Start , Sloppy Finish	This RKO second feature stars Lucille Ball and James Ellison , starts out amusingly - - particularly the scene where Ellison is hung over and the toaster is very noisy - - but ends in very predictable fashion . The leads can't hold this fluff together : Ball is unconvincing and Ellison is too montonous . Robert Coote , in support , is excellent .
439400	1617546	37121	5.0	Neither the Right Way Nor the Wrong Way	This is a flag-waving programmer about the lives of boots at the Great Lakes Training Facilities during World War II . It manages to cover all the bases without doing much wrong . This Pine-Thomas feature - - they were known as " Dollar Bills " because of their ability to squeeze out a decent flick on a tight budget - - manages to have a few interesting bits despite a lack of top-notch talent . The central story , about turning around an unwilling draftee Robert Lowery , who is more interested in winning a boxing championship than the War , and his romance with gorgeous WAVE Jean Parker is a bit subpar , but a fine supporting cast including a humorous ex-shoe clerk Roscoe Karns , cowboy Tom Keene whose son has already died in the war and and Robert Armstrong as their instructor manages to keep things humming along .
439048	1617546	248371	5.0	Up in the Air , Junior Birdman	Robinet , the lead in this Italian slapstick comedy , wants to be an aviator in the worst way , and this being an Italian slapstick , that's how he does it . Italian slapstick in this period was absolutely bone-breaking , so much so that it makes Keystone slapstick look like drawing-room comedy by contrast . Although the course of this comedy is not terribly surprising - - Robinet gets in the air and causes general destruction , mostly by knocking the tops off tall buildings - - the design of his aircraft is particularly amusing . It resembles a giant sturgeon with a forward propeller and one on top - - an auto-gyro of some sort - - with wings and , of course , a jaw hinged to open and close constantly , suggesting , perhaps a crocodile . At five minutes it is no long enough to get tiresome and you should find it tolerably amusing for that length of time .
439191	1617546	268468	5.0	Stop Motion History	This short subject - - about one reel - - is more interesting as an historical artifact than as a work of art : it was Harryhausen's first independent production after working for George Pal . Essentially a silent with a synchronized sound score , it covers four Mother Goose rhymes animating the supertitled words that appear one at a time like a teletype . Although the animation is not as elaborate and convincing as it would become by the 1960s , underneath the overly bright colors and banal images , you can still see Harryhausen's sense of humor , particularly in the credits . Even so , it's not particularly fascinating . For Harryhausen fans only .
438354	1617546	28513	5.0	Good Actors Prop Up Bad Script	One of the problems with a lot of courtroom dramas of the 1930s - - and this one in particular - - is that they are mysteries . Now mysteries make good stories and good movies , since they have usually have a fast start - - someone is killed - - and a definite plot - - the detection of the guilty . But when they take place in the courtroom , as does this one , they are largely composed of showing that the accused person did not do it - - and what does that say about all the people involved in the investigation and the prosecution ? It results in a certain amount of idiot plotting and I always find that annoying . Lawyers do not ask questions they do not know the answer to , and people do not pop up to confess that they shot the dead man , Perry Mason notwithstanding . Nonetheless , this movie is not awful , and it is largely due to the work of the actors involved . Walter Abel , as the accused , and Ann Harding , as the secretary who loves him , are fine actors and manage to bring a semblance of emotional reality , if not verisimilitude to this piece of tripe . Not enough to make it worthwhile - - both actors have been much better served - - but enough to keep you watching to the hackneyed end .
439046	1617546	87645	5.0	Good Leads Fail To Sparkle	John Ritter and Penny Marshall lead a capable TV movie comedy cast in this tale of moral love in suburbia that somehow fails to ever really get off the ground . Director Tony Bill does an able job and the lack of sparkle is , for me , something of a mystery . The early scenes are played , perhaps , a bit too slow and straight . The situation of the affair that triggers the plot , perhaps , is telegraphed or maybe it tries too hard to be the anti-BOB & CAROL & TED AND ALICE in its own , TV-clean way . Certainly there is nothing in the dialogue to raise it above average . In any case , there is nothing that seems to me to be clearly wrong with this movie , and it may work out better for you , if you are fond of the early 1980s . But I think not .
439379	1617546	415993	5.0	Bless Mickey Rooney	As I write this in 2007 , Mickey is still chugging along . One new appearance is already on the books for him in the IMDb , in the 82nd year of his movie career , He played midgets in the 1926 , was MGM's biggest star in the late 1930s and is still chugging along . Bless him . As to this short , it's nothing much : an attempt to compete with the enormous success of Hal Roach's OUR GANG series , using one of Fontaine Fox's comic strips ( he was best known for the Toonerville Trolley , and , indeed , this one takes place among the youngsters of that megalopolis ) that isn't very successful , because Mickey is about ninety per cent of the show and he's not good enough to carry a movie , even of this length , at this tender age . But bless him anyway .
438732	1617546	230675	5.0	How He Do Go On	Another of the seemingly innumerable FitzParick Traveltalks , a Technicolor series that MGM distributed for a couple of decades . In an era where a trip to the local movie theater was all that most moviegoers could afford , these afforded some interesting shots of exotic locales , and , indeed , the Technicolor photography , here by future Oscar winner Winton Hoch , is quite lovely . However I should note that Mr . FitzPatrick - - who , besides producing and narrating this series , also ran a travel agency for those who could afford to travel - - rendering these , in effect , low-key infomercials - - speaks in what I can only describe as an emphatic drone , as if every word is of great , although equal importance . These series are of most interest when they show buildings or ways of life that have vanished . Do they still use dog-drawn milk-carts in Quebec ?
439432	1617546	25639	5.0	Bad Boy , Bad Movie	Peculiarly ill-tempered version of much-made story . Seems to be a part tailor-made for Jackie Cooper , but long-time stalwart Meighan seems tired - - he died two years after this movie was made of cancer , and might not have been up to the part . Perhaps it would have been better done four years earlier when Cooper was doing Our Gang comedies at Roach . . . .
438935	1617546	6978	5.0	Innocuous and pointless	It is interesting to look at the talent involved in this half-reel movie - - Hal Roach behind the camera , Harold Lloyd , Bebe Daniels and Snub Pollard in front of it - - and think : Well . Miss Daniels has been in the movies six years at this point . She's the veteran . She was 15 at the time this was released . Lloyd was doing Lonesome Luke at this point , one of the many Chaplin imitators of the period , and he was making an effort to be somewhat different . Chaplin was short and his clothes were too big . Lloyd was tall and his clothes were too small . When it comes down to it , however , this movie , despite a good set-up , is simply not terribly interesting . If you wish to see everything any of these four people did - - and they later did some excellent work - - then see it . Otherwise , avoid it .
439408	1617546	8372	5.0	A Fish Called Stanley	Not much survives of this , Stan Laurel's first movie . By my watch , assuming that it was cranked at the right speed , just 73 seconds , which involve Stan , wearing a tricorn hat , almost getting run over by a steamroller , then getting on it and having it move in various unusual maneuvers and speeds . At the end , he appears in a nice straw boater and blue blazer , and he is dragged off by various people , presumably to a nut house . What can I usefully say about this film ? It is nothing , just another scrap of film from another of the innumerable short comedies produced in the 1910s and 1920s , except that , of course , Stan Laurel would be teamed up with Oliver Hardy a decade later and star , direct and write some of the greatest film comedies that exist . But at this stage , he is . . . . not much . True , he was a former member of the Fred Karno troupe , whence Chaplin had come . . . and later , the great British comedian and astronomer , Will Hay . But for the moment , he is someone whose potential lay in the future . I rate this a , but for historical interest only .
439145	1617546	4630	5.0	First You Have To Explain . . . .	At the top of the comments page is a request : if you've seen this title , please write a review for others . But there is so much to explain about this movie before a useful comment can be made , that it becomes a meaningful problem . First and foremost , this is a silent picture in black and white . This means that , at the time I write this review , perhaps one person in ten thousand would be willing to see it at all . The prejudice against black and white movies is , I feel , foolish , but silent movies pose an even greater problem to the modern moviegoer . As brilliant as they may be , it is usually only the great comedies that make any sense to modern moviegoers . Silent movies are rewarding , yes , but they are not meant for the passive moviegoer who sits down and says " Entertain me ! " You must pay attention . You must understand that you are dealing with a society that is long gone . Are there a hundred people alive in 2005 who saw this movie ninety-one years ago ? The last and foremost problem is that this is not a movie such as you are used to , a series of pictures that tell a story with occasional titles to convey dialogue or scene-setting . No , the titles tell the story and the movie illustrates it . This movie-making technique was dying out when this movie was made . If you are willing to put in the work to look at this movie , here are some of the things you might wish to look for . First , the prints available seem to be in good shape , but there seem to be issues with the continuity . Perhaps someone went back and edited the movie to make it shorter , and did a bad job . Perhaps when this print was assembled , there were technical issues with the cutting continuity . The acting is primitive , even by the standards of the era . Nonetheless , the movie was a smash hit and made its star , Dustin Farnum , such a star that for twenty years after , women named their babies after him , including the mother of Dustin Hoffman . The good points of this movie are that it is much more complicated than later versions of this often-filmed movie . It hints at the complexity and philosophic issues of the Rex Beach novel it is based on . True , this makes characters appear out of nowhere and vanish just as suddenly , but such issues are not restricted to movies more than ninety years old . It also has some beautiful cinematography , particularly the early , ship-bound sequences which seem to have been filmed on actual ships of the era . And once the action gets going , it gets moving fast , with explosions and fistfights aplenty . So , is this movie worth your time ? I'm afraid you'll have to look at it and tell me .
439245	1617546	129011	5.0	The Lion Squeaks	Static , early MGM short covering the city desk of the " Daily News " , where the usually-reliable Roscoe Karns is the managing editor . Everyone speaks very loudly and very clearly and every emotion is ludicrously overemphasized . Some interesting setting shots of linotype operators .
438778	1617546	990	5.0	A World In Turmoil	Dickens ' OLIVER TWIST is lovingly filmed for the screen by Vitagraph co-head , Blackton . A good deal of money has obviously been spent on costume and sets , but it is evident that Blackton was not concerned with the major changes in the industry that Griffith was wreaking at the Biograph Studios in Manhattan and that , indeed , were going on in New Jersey at the Edison Studios . The sets are clearly stage flats ; the actors emote in a stagy fashion that was already a bit old fashioned ; and the world of Oliver Twist fits snugly into a proscenium arch . Within two years , Blackton would largely retreat to the business office and Vitagraph would begin to produce some innovations of its own , but in an industry undergoing such rapid changes , two years is little short of eternity . One advance worth noting is the crediting of a performer on screen : Elita Proctor Otis as Nancy . Miss Otis had a career on Broadway that spanned about 25 years and apparently Blackton wanted her badly enough to offer her a screen credit . It is the earliest one I have seen , giving her a good claim to being the first screen star .
438830	1617546	28144	5.0	Pitching too straight for a screwball	Released the same year as MGM's LIBELED LADY , this light Warner's crime drama shares a lot of plot points , tries for a comic take on the subject , but fails , in no small part because Pat O'Brien does not display the diffident feyness that William Powell brought to his role , in part because Margaret Lindsay lacks a light touch but mostly , I fear , because the screenwriters and director Nick Grinde can't quite bring off the material - - certainly Pat O'Brien was capable of handling comedy material and there is a lot of strong comic supporting actors . It's odd to see Cesar Romero , who could have played his role as a gangster with great comic timing , play it straight . The two best comedians are Al Bridge and Harry Hayden , in two almost invisible roles - - both later members of Preston Sturges ' stock company . But screwball was still finding its way at this point , and Nick Grinde was not the director to help it along . Too bad .
439283	1617546	214684	5.0	A Dog's Life	Fala was the famous Scotch Terrier owned by Franklin Delano Roosevelt during his last two presidential terms , , the cause of a bit of a controversy and a stern lesson to the Republicans that you can attack a man , but best leave his dog alone - - a lesson that Nixon learned well enough to use to advantage in his Checkers Speech . Just so there's no misunderstanding , let me state I like dogs : big dogs , anything from an Irish wolfhound down to a corgi . I have no patience with small dogs , even though my sister likes terriers and her current dog is a Westy . In any case , this short subject , giving the ' home front ' story from the viewpoint of Fala is an amusing conceit , and it's given the usual MGM polish , even though everyone is a stand in . But the idea does not travel well past World War Two and dog lovers . . . . so it come out a little too precious for my taste .
439103	1617546	249454	5.0	Monkeyshines	A large monkey arrives in a crate at a private house and escapes . Everyone , led by a bald-headed man in a housedress chases it . This sort of early slapstick movie was the standard model during this period , being used for runaway horses , pumpkins and whatnots , until Mack Sennett added a bit of standard story , usually derived from Griffith , around it for his Keystone movies . Here , in its early form , the entire movie consists completely of the chase and only the variety of acrobatic contortions used in the process - - and , of course , what they are chasing . Indeed , the route they take seems to have been largely set for the subgenere . This being an Italian slapstick , the stunts are particularly vicious - - there is one scene in which they climb down a chimney . This does not , alas , allow it enough individuality to make it particularly interesting .
439212	1617546	142149	5.0	Fred , Not Tex	Tex Avery worked on this one , credited as an ' artist ' and it must have annoyed him , because while the construction of this cartoon and the gags are good , the timing is slow and , at times , awful - - and Tex , as we know , was always anxious to get on to the next gag . We've only got a few minutes folks . Instead , we are caught up in the relatively meaningless plot , as Pete tries to kidnap Oswald's girlfriend and he has to rescue her . From the carnival by the sea . That's enough basic ideas for Tex to have constructed four cartoons and have enough gags left over to leave for Michael Lah . Oswald has been in some pretty good cartoons , but this , alas , is not one of them .
438635	1617546	18885	5.0	Isadore , Not Friz	In this , the first of more than three hundred cartoons that Isadore ' Friz ' Freleng ever directed , we see no sign of his future greatness - - although he does use one of his favorite gags , of some one entering one door and then exiting another , unrelated door later . This was one of the Oswald the Lucky Rabbit cartoons that were produced for Charles Mintz after he cheated the rights to the cartoon character out of Disney and then lost them , in turn to Universal Pictures . It is , so far as future efforts are concerned , no better and no worse than the others of this period , with Oswald , as co-directed by Rudolph Ising , simply another frenetic clown , doing the same sorts of cartoon shticks that cartoon firemen would do for another ten years .
438689	1617546	22741	5.0	Not Betty Boop	The Van Beuren cartoon factory suffered for some time in not being able to figure out what sort of cartoons it wished to produce . This is sort of a Betty Boop cartoon ( with a Helen-Kane-style singing cat in a dress and the gags are very much in the Fleischer vein , although the artwork is far superior in execution , if not in concept . That , I suppose , sums up far too much of the Van Beuren product : short on ideas , long on execution .
438723	1617546	26337	6.0	You Are There !	It's odd how certain images get so into the public mind that they become ridiculous in themselves . Here is the chubby-looking , pencil-mustachioed Frank Buck , strolling around the jungle in pith helmet and shorts , to order the natives in how to capture pythons , monkeys and tigers for zoos in the United States . It sounds ridiculous , and if you watch carefully you will see some careful camera cheating to make things look more dangerous than they actually are - - it looks , for example , as if he captures a 20-foot python by throwing his jacket over it But Buck did capture these wild animals and if there was a certain amount of cheating for the camera , well , it works . Which is all the justification one needs .
438467	1617546	8918	6.0	Decent but Title Heavy	I saw this one under a handicap : they didn't have a camera with a suitable aperture , so the left of the image was cut off down to Academy ratio and there was no accompaniment - - two conditions under which one should not see a silent film . However , it was that or nothing and so any reader is warned that my opinion may be influenced by these issues - - but I don't think so . I used to haunt the 80 Saint Marks and I lost a pair of shoe soles in the old Regency , glued there by thirty years ' deposit of Coca-Cola residue . At least I hope it was Coke residue . Anyway , this change-of-pace comedy shows Bill Hart doing some nice comedy - - his dislike of a top hat is most amusing - - and he climbs about the buildings of Manhattan - - Joe August must have enjoyed the trip out east - - like a combination of Douglas Fairbanks and Will Rogers . But despite a good beginning and a good ending , there is a title-heavy middle section in which every joke is contained in the titles and most of the plot events , too . The result is a middle that drags . Add in a couple of thoroughly unlikeable characters that we are supposed to like - - Arthur Shirley and his movie-father , Andrew Robson , and you have a movie that is carried solely on the abilities of William S . Hart - - which are sufficiently broad to make this worthwhile , if not a classic .
438827	1617546	39032	6.0	The Thrill of Keenan Wynn ?	A goofy Columbia musical : let's remake Hawks ' HIS GIRL Friday as a musical , only instead of Cary Grant , Rosalind Russell and Ralph Bellamy , we'll have Keenan Wynn , Evelyn Keyes and Allyn Joslyn , and instead of it being about newspapers and death , it will be about - - - nightclub producers ! Sounds like a waste of time , doesn't it ? Well , despite the undeniable talent of the people involved - - as well as that of director Sylvan Simon , yes it is . Except for the musical numbers and those are standouts . The songs aren't much , decent but forgettable , but dance director Nick Castle knew how to choreograph a dance number so well that they were lifting them five yes later for MGM musicals . And then , of course , there's Ann Miller . When she starts tapping , the movie becomes not just good but great . But there's too much time between the musical numbers . Worthwhile , but not great .
439174	1617546	246482	6.0	Talent	A fairly good comedy short from 1925 , made more interesting by the talent involved : future Laurel & Hardy supporting actor Jimmy Finlayson stars ; Stan Laurel directs and co-writes ; James Parrott , brother of Charley Chase and future L & H director co-writes ; L & H cinematographer Art Lloyd is behind the camera and future KING KONG star Fay Wray has a small role . Fin is very good as a faithful husband , whose wife is looking for proof that more than his eyes have been roving . She hires a private detective to provide it . It consists of three scenes and the one in which Fin is trying to pick out a new hat is interesting . He was always good at registering comic dislike .
438539	1617546	23591	6.0	Not a Great Cartoon , but . . .	Very few of the cartoons directed by Rudolf Ising - - or his partner , High Harman - - for Merrie Melodies were very good . They were still far too busy trying to create Disney look-alikes ( like Bosko , for Mickey Mouse ) , maintain their contracts and deal with their intermediary , Leon Schlesinger , whom they would shortly try to cut out of the equation and who would reply by raiding their shop and forming the nucleus of Termite Terrace . Nonetheless , they had a few good ideas and this one , in which a man leaves his library and characters emerge from books , would become a staple of cartoons for the next dozen years , leading to pictures set in drug stores , road signs , neon lights and book stores . This cartoon , therefore , is not very good , but is important enough to warrant your looking at it .
439135	1617546	285760	6.0	good for what ails you	Silly little comedy short about Rudy Vallee running a hospital where he cures his patients - - one of whom suffers from Pagliacci - - by means of music . Perked up by a rare onscreen appearence by Mae Questal , better known as the voices of Betty Boop and Olive Oyl . Vallee sings " Keep a Little Song Handy " , " Mammy " and the immortal " My Alabammy Mammy Pain " .
438927	1617546	9144	6.0	Hard-Knocks slapstick but . . . .	At first this appears to be no more than another bone-grinding slapstick of the era . Harold plays a beauty parlor worker who wishes to slap Snub , kick his boss , beat up on Bud Jamison , and to flirt with every pretty girl , particularly incompetent manicurist Bebe : just another knockabout slapstick in which the ' jokes ' are sheer physical violence . Yet , even at this stage , there is something more to Lloyd's comedies than that . For one thing , this is better constructed and paced than most comedies of the era . . . . although that might be an artifact of cut-up prints usually projected at incorrect speeds - - silent movies were meant to be shown at varying speeds , but the invention of the photofone sound-on-film technique meant that every frame had to be shown at the same speed . That is one possible explanation of the difference , but it won't explain it all . Look at this one yourself and perhaps you may come up with a better explanation .
438960	1617546	56859	6.0	Adventure Flick	Decent although unremarkable adventure flick as Keenan Wynn - - who looks dashing and satanic in a beard - - and a crew composed of other Royal Navy Reservists - - go searching for stolen Nazi gold . The opening sequence in which the team is assembled and instructed via ape recording looks like it was lifted for " Mission Impossible " three years later .
438493	1617546	33696	6.0	Powered by Gleason	This , the third in the series of Roach ' streamliners ' - - short comedy features about 50 minutes in length - - about Sgt . Doubleday , the instant non-com with the photographic memory is , like the others , an unremarkable comedy , some good bits placed in a script that often seems to start and stop , but it does have one great positive value in the performance of James Gleason , a funny and highly talented comic performer for thirty years in Hollywood . Usually cast in some role that suited his lower-class New York accent - - check him out as the cab driver in THE BISHOP'S WIFE - - here he plays the regimental colonel : vain , pompous and father of a very pretty daughter who , with the issue of pistol shooting , is the core of the story . If you feel that he is not enough to make this movie worthwhile , I certainly understand . But for me he made the difference between a dull hour and a pleasant one .
439093	1617546	20175	6.0	Go And Darken My Doorstep No More	This is a fairly good early talkie , thanks to a good original story by Booth Tarkington and an amusing performance by Leo Carillo who , in this phase of his career , always wound up playing Italians . Here he seems to be channeling Chico Marx and he comes to the rescue of orphan Virginia Valli , who has been tossed out of her uncle's house for drinking ginger ale in a road road while he is running for election on a temperance ticket , and he'll keep the two thousand dollars left her , thank you . Given that start , I don't have to tell you how everything turns out . The performances are good . Carillo's role was originally intended for Otis Skinner , but he dropped out for some reason . Cinematographer Ernest Miller - - who spent his long career mostly shooting B Westerns - - and editor Arthur Roberts manage to keep you from noticing the stage-bound shooting by a careful combination of cutting and changing perspective . The sound track is a little thin and scratchy , but that might be an artifact of this particular print . There are several amusing lines scattered throughout the dialogue and the result is a a pleasant , if old-fashioned time waster .
438529	1617546	360877	6.0	Not long enough to be annoying	One of the problems with the disappearance of the short subject is that everything has to be a feature - - even if it doesn't warrant it . Fortunately , some people still make short films , even if they are usually student works , and occasionally one shows up that is worthwhile . This one , based on a short story , is one that needs to be made as a short story or not at all . Doubtless we will see the two-hour feature version of this with high-tech special effects and lots of fake blood scattered about in a few years . In the meantime , let us enjoy this decent short .
439127	1617546	22219	6.0	Sound !	Antediluvian soundie cannot do justice to the enormous talent of Washington . Although the picture is sharp and the composition is excellent , Washngton's voice is washed out as he sings the title song while lounging against a tree and his ' mammy ' berates him into getting a job moving empty crates in Harlem .
439064	1617546	20258	6.0	The Young Son and Heir	Dated , stagey and suffering from a static camera , this early Philip Barry play still manages to pack a wallop due to Barry's wonderful dialogue and the strengths of the leads , Frederick March and Ann Harding , right at the beginning of their careers , but possessed of a naturalness that carries this movie along . Thanks to the Vitaphone Project for reuniting the rediscovered soundtrack to the moving image .
438916	1617546	33382	6.0	Nodding Off In A Moving Vehicle	Some wonderful actors are a lot of fun in a curiously unengaging screwball comedy . The cast is a great one : Fredric March and Loretta Young in the leads , with Robert Benchley , Eve Arden , the unfortunately forgotten Allyn Joslyn and Helen Westley as a blonde bimbo . It has some wonderful comedic moments - - the one where Young orders Westley to sit down and play the piano is priceless . However , the whole thing never quite gels . Perhaps it is because of the theatrical background of the story : March gives one of his few miscalculated performances . It is impossible to tell when his character is being sincere and when his character is trying to manipulate the other characters . When he is in full blown theatrical mode , as in THE ROYAL FAMILY OF Broadway , he is hilarious . When he he plays a small-time chiseler , as in NOTHING SACRED , he is hilarious . Perhaps it is because there seems to be no chemistry between him and Young . It is appropriate to their characters ' relationship in the movie , but it is not , very interesting . And that pretty well describes this movie . Watch it for the moments , but not for the movie .
438770	1617546	35362	6.0	Roy Rogers Rides Again	Plenty of amusement in this Roy Rogers movie as the folks borrow the plot of DESTRY RIDES AGAIN . Roy's father and grandfather were both old-fashioned , famous western sheriffs . Gabby Hayes fetches him out to deal with cattle rustlers . . . . but the FGI after his name is not the Federal Gureau of Investigation , but Fellow of the Geographical Institute . As usual in these movies , a lot of care is taken for some lovely cinematography , although there are some obvious day-for-night shot given away by the shadows . The Sons of the Pioneers , as you might expect , show up to sing a few songs , and this high-class B Western is sure to please fans of the genre .
438446	1617546	330107	6.0	Kids Type the Darnedest Things	Louis Feuillade was Gaumont's director of whatever they needed directing for a couple of decades from about 1907 : classic serials such as JUDEX and LES VAMPIRES , melodramas of all lengths , slapstick comedies and kiddie comedies , particularly those of the Bout Le Zan series . In this one , Bebe is a child actor in a kiddie comedy , pinched , along with the director , because a lot of " cinematic artists " have been running con games , stiffing restaurant bills , and so forth , and they are hauled into the nearest police precinct and put into the hands of a prefect who has had enough of this sort of nonsense . The humor in this short , as in several of Feuillade's kiddie comedies , arises from his children behaving in very unchildlike fashion . Worth looking at once for the pleasure of the joke
438620	1617546	33508	6.0	Counterpunching	This rarely-seen cartoon from Rudolph Ising shows that he was still watching what the competition was doing and trying to equal or better it - - Fantasia had come out the year before and this looks like his reply to it . But to my taste it doesn't work , marred by the excessive sentimentality and " it's for the kiddies " mentality that lingered at his and Hugh Harman's studio . Hanna and Barbera had already moved across to work for Fred Quimby directly at MGM , taking their vicious streaks with them , and while FANTASIA could do with one or two " for the kiddies " sequence among its variety of offerings , this solo short must be viewed on its own merits : beautifully backgrounded , lovely music conducted by the talented Scott Bradley , but utterly banal . There's nothing wrong in doing something for the kiddies , but I could watch A CORNY CONCERTO , Termite Terrace's reply to FANTASIA , with pleasure when I was three and I can still watch it with pleasure half a century later . That's the difference between competence and greatness . Ising learned and he did start to turn out cartoons fit for man as well as boy . But it was too little and too late .
438437	1617546	481189	6.0	Knockabout Farce - - then knock him down and step on him	Paul Bertho stars in this pretty funny knockabout force from 1911 , It's a real knockabout slapstick piece and one of the most violent I have ever seen , as people attempt to cushion their falls by landing on other comedians . The second half does some nice camera trickery as Bertho seems to hide in a large satchel , which travels on along , evading his pursuers . I can't tell if this is done by good stop motion and cutting or by simply having a string on the bag : probably stop motion , but the viability of other methods is a plus . This is a very primitive movie - - the Italian comedies of this period usually lack much in the way of mise-en-scene , but the cutting is very much in the style of Melies . Still , it's mostly interesting from an historical perspective .
439108	1617546	10023	6.0	Dog Doesn't Bite Man	This is one of forty shorts that Harold Lloyd made in 1919 . It's fast , it's furious , and it has a lovely gag sequence in which Harold tries to steal a sausage , loses it to a dog and . . . . well , it's very funny . Too fast and furious to make much sense , but a lot of fun .
438697	1617546	29358	6.0	High Production + Home Spun = Freak Show	Hal Roach was getting out of the short subject business when this movie was being made . He had fired Charley Chase , Laurel and Hardy were doing features only and he was negotiating to sell ' Our Gang ' to MGM , where the shorts would continue to be produced for another nine years . In the meantime , Roach was trying to produce longer Our Gang pieces , short features , or increase the production value by other means to get a higher price for his product . This is the result : Alfalfa sings in that annoying voice of his that people obviously considered cute . And there is a major ' night club ' sequence , populated with the rascals . The problem is that Our Gang kids were chosen to be , well , kids , and the results here - - watching six year olds screech swing versions of " Loch Lomond " is pretty aggravating .
439102	1617546	11358	6.0	John Ford at Fox	John Ford - - still credited as ' Jack ' Ford - - moved from Universal to Fox and directed this Buck Jones comedy-drama as his first effort . He directed it competently for the era , without much in the way of flair , but it is interesting in that he would return to this theme of the ne'er-do-well who turns out to be a pretty nice guy throughout his career - - his best handling of the theme would probably be with the series of comedies he directed Will Rogers in a decade and a half later . In the meantime , though , Ford was still finding his way , constrained by the fact that he was working with Buck Jones , a competent but not extraordinary actor , instead of Harry Carey ; his mise-en-scene is constricted by the town setting of most of the show , although there are some nice shots about two-thirds of the way through when the robbery is being planned out of town by the bandits ; and the lack of the extraordinary stock company of actors he would accumulate over the next forty years , The result is pleasant enough , although if it weren't for the fact this were a John Ford picture we wouldn't think it worthy of much commentary . Nonetheless , given that Ford is arguably the greatest director in the history of cinema , this movie is worth seeing , and our thanks are due to the people at Fox for making a beautiful DVD edition available in their amazing FORD AT FOX set .
439007	1617546	227668	7.0	It's Your Turn in the Barrel	Melies provides us with a simple magic trick - - or is it so simple ? - - as , dressed in Greek garb , he stuffs nine young women in chitons , one after another , into a barrel . It's not terribly elaborate , but it is very well done , as he presents us with simply a magic trick , combining his skills as a stage magician with those of a camera magician - - and he knows his art enough to give us a topper at the end . This is one of the many previously lost or infrequently seen Melies pictures that have been made available by Serge Bromberg , David Shepherd and a myriad of other hands in the newly issued DVD set GEORGES MELIES : FIRST WIZARD OF CINEMA . Required viewing for anyone interested in the history of movies . . . . . and a lot of fun .
438889	1617546	10925	7.0	Sennett beats the Kaiser	A funny and stylistically interesting feature from the Sennett studio directed by wunderkind Richard Jones . Although his comedies generally featured human-looking comics for Sennett and Roach , as opposed to the grotesques made popular at Keystone , in this one he combines the two styles : the Allies look and act like normal people , but the Germans are in the full grotesque makeup of the earlier films , acting with the exaggerated mannerisms one expects from the Sennett studio . The entire Sennett company is on view here and the jokes are crude , take advantage of the propaganda of the era - - there is a joke about German soldiers capturing a Belgian convent - - and funny . If you don't know this style of comedy , you may be taken aback by it . If , however , you like this sort of thing - - and I do - - you will have a lot of fun .
439014	1617546	223508	7.0	Stage and Film Magic	Melies started out as a stage magician , but he quickly learned and invented a lot of film magic too , which he uses to great and good effect in this effort : the one where he slices the boy in half is wonderful . It's a thirty-second magic act , little more , but must have been a real jaw-dropper when originally shown . This is one of the many previously lost or infrequently seen Melies pictures that have been made available by Serge Bromberg , David Shepherd and a myriad of other hands in the newly issued DVD set GEORGES MELIES : FIRST WIZARD OF CINEMA . Required viewing for anyone interested in the history of movies . . . . . and a lot of fun .
438973	1617546	17747	7.0	Well Timed Farce	A year after they had a hit with the social comedy SKINNER'S DRESS SUIT , director Seiter and actor Reginald Denny teamed up again in this sharply-turned farce . reminiscent of the sort that Clarence Badger was doing with Raymond Griffith over at Paramount . There are the usual complications that lead to the situations in this farce : an adventuress - - Gertrude Astor - - with incriminating letters , a young couple in love - - that's Denny and Gertrude Olmstead - - and a crook pretending to be Reginald Denny's character . The timing is brisk , the situations comical , the pratfalls well taken and if dialogue instead of titles might sharpen it a tad , the silent version we have is quite funny without them .
438658	1617546	24550	7.0	Freedonia's Going to Peace	A typically good Charley Chase short subject , this one is marred a little by a hasty ending , but getting there is a lot of fun . Armistice has just been declared , and if War is Hell , then getting out of France is even worse , as Sergeant Chase and his squadron first continue fighting a battle with a cow and then , as he is about to leave for New York with Nita Pike , he gets thrown into service to pay back his laundry bill . Luis Alberni is funnier than usual , as he fails to overlay his Italian accent with a French one , and the two interludes of working off his debt are filled out with a couple of musical numbers : " Mine , All Mine " and a nice little song and dance routine with a push broom to " Sidewalk Sam " - - it's always a nice bit in a Chase soundie when he sings , since he started his career as a song-and-dance man in vaudeville . Not a great Chase picture but , as usual , it has many great moments .
438490	1617546	154594	7.0	" Your grandson is facing a grave crisis .	" We believe his first tooth is arriving . " So reads one of the titles in this episode of one of the many charming Mr . & Mrs . Sidney Drew comedies from this period . Although most people now think that silent comedy was slapstick and little more , there were a large number of drawing-room comedies and the Drews specialized in them : well written - - usually by Mrs . Drew - - and wonderfully performed . They were enormously popular , first at Vitagraph and later in their own company , releasing through Metro . This one , about the travails of anxious parents , worrying that their child is an idiot because his first tooth is late in arriving , is filled with funny titles like the above , but there are fewer sight gags than in most of them - - Mr . Drew , uncle of Lionel , John and Ethel Barrymore , was particularly adept at stage business . Because far too much of the story has to be told by title cards , I don't rate this among their best work , but it does show up on TCM and thus is probably one of the most accessible of their now frustratingly rare movies to survive . And it is still darned funny .
438919	1617546	2659	7.0	His Master's Silence	To appreciate why this comedy is so very funny , you need to stop and think about the story : a youngster , home alone . Gangsters come and break in . Desperately the child calls on the phone for help . Parents race to save the child . No , it's not HOME ALONE , it's several of D . W . Griffith's better known shorts . In THE LONELY VILLA , it is the phone that provides the call for help , and daddy races home in an auto . In THE GIRL AND HER TRUST , she is a telegrapher , and help comes on railroads . Yes , indeedy . THE BANGVILLE POLICE is a lampoon of a contemporary genre , just like the SCARY MOVIE franchise . And while the police force took on a life of its own , it had its origins in the works of Griffith , for whom Sennett had worked for years , and whom he called ' the Master ' . Even if Griffith rarely put cows in his pictures . . . . at least , not as major supporting actors .
439282	1617546	2639	7.0	Not the First , But the First Regular	There had been cinematic animations before Bray turned out this , his first animated cartoon , as far back of Blackton's Sketches in 1896 . But animation remained a labor-intensive and expensive form of movie , because someone had to draw each frame . Bray's studio was notable on two points : first , a lot of talent in the field passed through his doors , including Lantz , Fleischer and Paul Terry ; and he bought or encouraged the invention of various methods to bring the cost of cartoon production down to a manageable level : the Hurd-Bray patents were key to this , including cel technique . Therefore , although this is not the first animation or even the first regularly issued series of animation - - that honor would belong to Emile Cohl in France - - it is crucial because without it there would be very little : no Looney Toons , no Betty Boop , no Woody Woodpecker . . . . and so it is important . But when confronted with the statement that a particular film is important , we are , nonetheless , left with the question of ' is it any good ? ' Yes , it is . The animation is lively and the sequence in which the dog steals and devours a sausage is delightful . If you get a chance to witness this landmark film , don't miss the chance to get some enjoyment out of your research .
439052	1617546	303271	7.0	The World is About To End . Should I Mow the Lawn ?	This short subject , which starts off with a picture of a mushroom cloud arising from a nuclear explosion , is produced by " The National Clean Up - Paint Up - Fix Up Bureau " - - with of course , the cooperation of the Federal Civil Defense Administration . In an era when they exposed soldiers to atom bombs to study effects - - indeed , a couple of years before Howard Hughes imported sand from atomic testing sites for studio retakes of THE CONQUEROR , eventually resulting in the death by cancer of Dick Powell and the removal of one of co-star John Wayne's lungs - - this seemed sensible . In retrospect it looks like a parody of itself - - will a semi-gloss or a latex best resist the end of the world and should I use a white undercoating ? Or would wallpaper do a better job ? Maybe one of the Morris prints which uses lots of green arsenic for the nursery . In the meantime , you'd better throw out those old newspapers because when they drop the Bomb next door , they will burst into flames and lower real estate values . But , in many ways , B movies and industrial films provide us with the best view of contemporary thought from an era . For a major picture , you have many bright people laboring intensively to make every choice . For something like this , it's a matter of getting it today , not right , and so the casual easy choice that reveals the habits of the era is the one taken . So while you're busy laughing your head off at the stupidity of people more than half a century ago - - and trying hard not to think of what people will think about us in another half century - - consider this from a sociological viewpoint , if you would .
439013	1617546	224240	7.0	Religious FIlms	Having invented the trick film and the stag film ( with the same year's APRES LE BAL ) , Melies also pioneered the religious film , with this account of the temptation of St . Anthony , using the same sort of camera tricks he was using for his magic works . But I wonder : what was the placement order of his catalogue ? Did this come immediately after APRES LE BAL ? This is one of the many previously lost or infrequently seen Melies pictures that have been made available by Serge Bromberg , David Shepherd and a myriad of other hands in the newly issued DVD set GEORGES MELIES : FIRST WIZARD OF CINEMA . Required viewing for anyone interested in the history of movies . . . . . and a lot of fun .
439398	1617546	25328	7.0	The Little King	One of half a dozen movie cartoon's based on Soglow's " Little King " panel comic strip . These are among the best cartoons that Van Beuren turned out . Soglow did the writing and the simple black & white drawing that was in favor at Van Beuren matches Soglow's style and the strip was silent , which works well . Unhappily , there are only a few of these and none are in color . Some of the jokes are standard cartoon jokes , but the good ones are about the Little King and his desire to not have to deal with the boring rituals of being royalty . Fortunately , there's always a hot dog vendor or mermaid around when you want one . . . .
438356	1617546	34220	7.0	Looking Like Yourself	This typical farce plot - - easygoing George gets his hair marcelled and looks exactly like a South American opera singer , also played by George - - does not sound like Mr . Formby's usual métier , but he shows himself capable of carrying out the minor exigencies of the role , while singing a few nice songs , a typical " The Barmaid at the Rose & Crown " and a less typical swing song . Under the direction of farce director Marcel Varnel , George does a lot more shtick than in his usual vehicles , but it is well within his abilities . His leading lady is Linden Travers , best remembered for his supporting role in THE LADY VANISHES . She performs nicely , but except for George and Felix Aylmer in a small supporting role , it's an unremarkable series of performances . This is not to be sneered at : it is a star vehicle for George , and his usual charm is on full display .
439257	1617546	781473	7.0	South of the Border	Snub stars in a better-than-usual effort - - which I credit largely to some funny titles and the direction of Charley Chase - - as a spy sent out to rescue Marie Mosquini - - looking even more fetching than usual in a mantilla - - in a South American country where earthquakes happen every few minutes : the cameraman jiggles the camera , and all the actors and bricks on screen fall down . The gags are mostly based on these two premises and they form a fairly unified plot for a Snub Pollard movies - - plus Snub gets to show some facial reactions instead of the usual deadpan way he was usually directed by lesser directions , through the 1930s , when he played this same blank-faced character as comic relief ina few western , believe it or not .
439109	1617546	5315	7.0	Unpretentious , silly and fun	All right . It's not ON THE WATERFRONT . It is , however , several minutes of fast-paced , good-natured humor . The first half is a series of jokes that Arbuckle would elaborate on in ROUGH HOUSE three years down the road . The second half is a warmup for TEDDY AT THE THROTTLE , complete with Keystone Kops and the famous Keystone cyclorama . Roscoe tosses off a joke and gets on to the next one - - none of the elaboration of Chaplin or the grandeur of Keaton , but funnier , perhaps , for not having a fuss made . Look for yourself and see .
438364	1617546	142088	7.0	The Country and the Story	Andre Antoine filmed his silent version of Daudet's work with the sense of awe at the beauty of the city of Arles and the countryside surrounding it that you would expect if you have already seen his LA TERRE . He also slides us into the story in an ingenious manner : here is the a picture of Daudet who wrote it , and here is the mill he lived in where he wrote it , and here is Arles , and the river that runs through it and the farms near it and the person who lives on a farm , played by the actress . . . . and we are in the story . It is the telling of that story , though , I have issues with . It is a story of people and their thoughts and their words , and this is a silent movie . . . . and so takes a lot longer to do than a stage play . And so characters and subplots need to be cut , but Antoine is - - understandably - - loathe to cut them . And so we have the subplot of the shepherd and his lost love raised . . . . and dropped . We have characters who don't serve any purpose , not even the exposition of the character from the original , since their screen time is cut so severely . This is always a problem in the translation of a work of art from one medium to another . A movie is not a novel , a movie is not a play , a movie isn't a poem . Heck , a movie isn't a movie any more : they have sound and color and computerized special effects and even the caterer rates a screen credit . But the problem of translation from one medium to another remains : not only how to translate these words to images - - and Antoine does a superb job of that - - but which words to translate . Here he falls down a bit . Like any fan , he doesn't want to give up any of it , but as a responsible movie maker he knows he must - - and he leaves in just enough to tell us that what we are seeing is not a complete work of art . He belittles own work by not doing a neat job of work , so how seriously can we take it ? Well , there are some lovely images . Enjoy it for that .
439004	1617546	473992	7.0	Glad to See You !	After he dropped out as a Chaplin imitator , Billy West floundered a lot . He continued to make very funny comedies - - this is one of them - - but he lacked much of a personality . In this one , we have a perfectly timed series of gags about what happens when the very popular Bill returns to town . Who he is and what differentiates him , except for his lack of make-up , from a white-faced clown , we don't know . There were ways around this : Harold Lloyd simply turned back to single-reelers with a weekly schedule until he could figure out who his Glasses character was . But by the time Billy West tried to become his own man , there was too much competition .
439448	1617546	19101	7.0	Looking for quiet in the talkies	Mack Sennet's first sound film is a hilarious little short . The first half has Johnny Burke trying to propose to Daphne Burke on the telephone while construction workers , boat whistles and a saxophonist across the alley - - played by Vernon Dent - - makes it impossible to hear himself think . The second half , takes place in the country with similar results - - plus he goes hunting rabbits and runs into a lion .
438501	1617546	2303	8.0	The Sea Chase	Griffith loved to shoot along the shoreline and on the water . His settings , always so lifelike , take on a poetic quality along the shore , and the sight of the motorboat knifing through the water to rescue Blanche Sweet , with its beautiful wake . . . . . in any case , in this short , Griffith managed to combine his love of the shooting the water with one of his heart-in-your-throat chases , as the captain raises his gun to shoot Blanche's brains out before his mutinous crew can defile her . Yes , it works . Rent the Kino dvd and see for yourself . Although Griffith directed more than five hundred pictures , almost all of which survive , he has a vast corpus of works that are rarely seen , because so many people concentrate on his best features and perhaps a dozen of his best-known shorts . Kino is to be applauded for including a sizable number of his lesser-known , but equally powerful shorts in their most recent compilation , and for hiring John Mirsalis to do scores .
439165	1617546	14991	8.0	Lithuanians and Letts Do It	A fine film version of one of Elinor Glyn's silly romances . Miss Glyn founded the genre of what is today variously called the Romance Novel , the Gothic Romance or , in the trade , the Bodice-Ripper , since the heroine always winds up with a torn bodice or blouse . It happens here , too . The excellence of this version can best be understand when you hear that I saw it at the Museum of Modern Art today . The only titles were flash titles in Czech - - no one in the audience knew any of the Slavic languages . There was no script available and yet the story was perfectly intelligible and the movie was interesting , almost all due to fine direction by King Vidor and a very broad and appropriate performance by John Gilbert as a Russian nobleman . Aileen Pringle , as the object of his desire is not so good : she comes off as somewhat butch . But she is a fine actress and the overall effect is excellent . I don't know when you're going to get a chance to see this movie , but if you do , don't pass it up - - or any King Vidor film .
438984	1617546	14883	8.0	War Against Mice	An early Felix the Cat short which has most of the hallmark's of Messmer's fantastic imagination . Felix is working in a barber shop when his boss shows him an extra : the mice have declared war against the cats . Although it does not show the ' playing with light ' touch of the best Felix the Cat silents , there are plenty of good gags that made Felix the most popular cartoon series of the silent era .
438761	1617546	20337	8.0	One Long Arabian Night	Carl Schenstrøm and Harald Madsen were the leading pair of ' Fat and Skinny ' comedians in the movie world until Laurel and Hardy came along . While their characters never shed their movie-comic trappings - - ill fitting costumes , weird mustaches and bad hats - - they remained enormously popular and continued making films until 1940 - - two years after their first and best director , Lau Lauritzen Sr . died and two years before Schenstrom , the skinny one died . Kinowelt , which has had success with its Laurel & Hardy DVD set has produced a seven-DVD set of the comedies , under the name " Pat und Patachon " , the names they were known under in Germany . I have issues . The versions are cut down ( this one is 48 minutes instead of the original run time of 90 minutes ) and a voice over tells you what is going on - - in German , which , alas , I do not speak ) . These are apparently TV versions made in the late 1960s or early 1970s and it is difficult to judge what is missing - - although a lot of the continuity is definitely lost . This one was shot in England for British International Pictures and it shows . It begins with the two comics running a dilapidated bus , with a sequence of beautifully performed bone-breaking slapstick and continues as the two of them get their hands on a flying carpet . The camera-work is also better than most of their Danish work - - lots of moving shots where appropriate , and special effects , It is a pleasure to see these two perform as they rarely seemed to be in their other works .
438933	1617546	9732	8.0	With a bullet	An excellent early short comedy for Harold Lloyd's ' Glass ' character . He plays a meek conservatory graduate who wows the matrons and winds up playing in a western saloon , where Snub is the bartender and Bebe the Salvation Army lass . Harold is , of course , confused for a dangerous character and the gags flow fast and free for a while . Even Snub gets one or two funny ones .
439088	1617546	181680	8.0	Max's American Debut	After Charlie Chaplin left Essannay , they needed a new comedy superstar and who but Max Linder , who had been France's leading comedy movie star - - and the world's - - for ten years ? So Max left Paris and came to Chicago . Here in Max's second American film , we can see him adapting his style from the realistic French style to a more American style . The plot is simple and the complications amusing : Max stands to inherit seven million dollars if he is not married . So he tells his bride they have to get a divorce until the money comes through . In order to get a divorce , though , they need a cause , so Max arranges an assignation and for a private detective to show up . In the meantime , the apartment he has taken is at the back of an insane asylum and his wife disguises herself as the maid in order to make sure no funny business really takes place . . . . The entire situation is far more slapstick than Max usually indulged in , but he is certainly up to the task , behaving just as Charley Chase would a decade later in his great series for Roach . Plus Max manages to insert a few beautiful shots , including a lovely silhouette . If the series was not as successful as had been hoped , this is still a fine two-reeler .
438514	1617546	29428	8.0	Dreaming of Wackyland	Bob Clampett , director of this cartoon , was one of the great cartoon directors that made Looney TUnes and Merrie Melodies so great . His greatest strength was his ability to take images and ideas and stretch them endlessly and his great masterpiece , PORKY IN WACKYLAND is the great exemplar of that . But here , in this short where Porky dreams of being an ancient Greek hero who fights the gorgon , we see that same sensibility . This is a riotous cartoon , full of puns both verbal and visual , and wild images . This would be , I feel , a great cartoon , except for one small flaw : it is all couched as a dream . But even with that , it is still excellent and a rarely seen cartoon . If you have a chance , don't miss it .
438515	1617546	278123	8.0	A Flea in Her Bridal Bed	If you are unfamiliar with Max Linder's films , it might be worthwhile to tell you that he was the first international comedy star and that Charlie Chaplin said he learned a great deal from watching his films . In his film career , which extended from 1905 through the mid-1920s , he typically played variations on the young boulevardier . In this one , it is his wedding night , married to the beautiful Stacia Napierkowska . He and his bride are sleeping . . . . . and a flea keeps disturbing him . The variety of his reactions and his increasingly agitated efforts to get rid of the pest are the whole of this excellent movie . A fine introduction to this comedian .
438714	1617546	164040	8.0	A League of Their Own	Old-time baseball player Clyde becomes the manager of a girl's softball team in this comedy that plays to his strength as a comic reactor . Lots of good jokes , far more believable situations than most Columbia comedy shorts , probably due to Charley Chase as one of the producers . Highly recommended . Andy Clyde started out in the silent era working for Sennet , but the sound era found him toiling in the short subjects department of Columbia , as well as the usual supporting roles as comic western sidekick , plus good roles wherever a Scotchman was needed - - he is easily found in the RKO version of Barrie's THE LITTLE MINISTER . His number of Columbia shorts is exceeded only by the Three Stooges , and are much better , based on better acting and a wider range of comic takes . They're getting a little difficult to find , but are worth the time of anyone who enjoys good comedy .
439343	1617546	10853	9.0	Raw Beauty	There is a great power in this movie . William S . Hart abandons his familiar cowboy gear to play the role of a Mountain Man guiding a wagon train across the west while trying to discover the truth about his young brother's murder . If the language veers between the poetic scene-setting titles , and the eye-dialect dialogue , there is great strength in Joseph August's photography and compositions . More than that , in the context of the silent film , Hart is a great actor . A stage star , he understood that the camera catches the smallest movement of the eye , His gestures , while melodramatically overwrought , are never overly wide . He infuses the character with truth . Perhaps this style of movie-making is a mystery to the modern movie-goer . When the shiphands sing ' Weep No More , My Lady ' , and the titles show the lyrics , they obviously have more importance than sound effects added by a Foley artist for artistic verisimilitude . Perhaps the melodramatic plots are as snicker-worthy as the sort of modern story in which villains commit murder for no discernible reason , but because they are crazed mass murderers , and the enforcers of the law catch them , not because it is their job , but because one of the victims is a relative and ' this time it's personal ' . . . but I don't think so . Both sorts of story are mythic in structure , telling us the truths we want to hear , It may well be that the modern movie-goer will have no patience for Hart's movies in general and WAGON TRACKS in particular . If that is the case , alas , they are missing a fine story , beautifully told , with striking black and white photography . Their loss .
439270	1617546	223412	9.0	Fighting Fire With Fire	This piece marks a return to form for Melies ' story films after several comparatively weak ones in 1907 - - he seems to have been concentrating on the business end of things and leaving matters in the hands of subordinates while Pathe and Gaumont were spending money to eat up his market . Here , however , we have his amazing compositions , back flats that have full dimensionality and some truly fantastic images - - he seems to have added purer tableaux technique to his shots . But how much longer could he stand off the better-financed studios ? This is one of the many previously lost or infrequently seen Melies pictures that have been made available by Serge Bromberg , David Shepherd and a myriad of other hands in the newly issued DVD set GEORGES MELIES : FIRST WIZARD OF CINEMA . Required viewing for anyone interested in the history of movies . . . . . and a lot of fun .
439244	1617546	17667	9.0	Two hams and some hard-boiled eggs	Superb silent version of the story of Francois Villon . Although remade in the thirties as IF I WERE KING , with Frank Lloyd directing , Preston Sturges scripting and Ronald Colman starring , this version is even better . Barrymore , with a cohort of comedians , plays the comic fool and the wine-depressed Villon with a verve that Colman could not match . The photography is startling in its beauty and innovation and the supporting cast , particularly Conrad Veidt in his American premiere , the incredibly beautiful Marceline Day , and the supporting comics , Slim Summerville and Hank Mann , steal every scene they are in . It is a shame that Barrymore did so few first-rate comedies . Among his sound films , only his lead in TWENTIETH CENTURY and his supporting role in MIDNIGHT can compare to this , and those stand up only because of his superb voice . In this silent movie , Barrymore must tell his tale without benefit of words , and he does so , alternately hilariously unrecognizable as the King of the Fools and tenderly as Villon in love . He even gets to leap around in the swashbuckling style of Fairbanks , most convincingly . He also lets his supporting cast have their share of glory , capering in this ensemble work like any talented comic of the era . Finally , a brief word about Alan Crosland , a director known today only for directing the first talking feature , THE JAZZ SINGER in the same year this was released . Crosland was a careful , innovative , delightfully original director , and it is a shame that more of his works are not known . Perhaps this movie , far more interesting as a movie than his best-known work , will be your introduction to his other talents . If so , you could do far worse .
438964	1617546	20371	9.0	Sea Wolf sans Nietzsche	Tourneur's last silent movie shows his full command of the silent film grammar - - much of which he invented - - in his beautiful compositions and still camera , punctuated for excellent effect by purposeful moving and process shots . He never uses the camera to make the viewer gasp at his brilliance , but only to punctuate a psychological point or improve the film's pace . The story , from the novel by Franzos Keremen , is a commentary on Jack London's SEA WOLF . London's Wolf Larsen is a Nietzschean philosopher . The captain , in this movie , is a schemer among brutes - - a correction to London's drunken maunderings that might have served humanity better . It is the gentle cook , played by Vladimir Sokoloff that is the real hero of the story after the crew mutinies and kills the ship's master . The movie also stars Marlene Dietrich , a few months before von Sternberg supposedly plucked her from obscurity . She looks a lot like Claudette Colbert in this movie and shows her command of film acting already . Very highly recommended .
438433	1617546	16013	9.0	The Mystic Power of Love	At his peak in the 1930s and 1940s , to watch Frank Borzage with pleasure , you have to believe in love as something more than a variety of lust . It can be transformative when living ( as in the terrific and subtle A MAN'S CASTLE ) and , in the hands of performers like Janet Gaynor and Charles Farrell , can even overcome death - - although I should caution the observant film watcher that the enormous power of those movies lies in the unequaled abilities of Miss Gaynor , who was a truly great film actor ; Mr . Farrell was a good one and gave many a fine performance , but it finally occurred to the people who made the movies that no one would go out of his way to see Mr . Farrell on his own . Although the influence of Murnau on Borzage is usually cited as key , looking at this movie , made three years before SUNRISE , we can see that the essence of Borzage is already in place : the small figures against the enormous vistas , the seemingly inevitable workings-out of the plot but most especially the way people look at each other : Buck Jones never gave a better performance than as the title character of this piece . As another reviewer has put it , it's all in the eyes . Visually , Borzage has not settled on his signature look , a gauzy effect achieved , according to legend , by filming through a pair of sheer white hose that softened the image and forced the audience to see what was in the viewer's heart . Instead , the print that was used in the Borzage / Murnau at Fox set seems both a little flat - - perhaps from a safety-stock print - - and possessed of a bit of dazzle on the right side of white objects . Perhaps this effect was intended . Perhaps not . In either case , this is a most welcome addition to my collection of silent movies .
438705	1617546	18860	9.0	the care and cares of the nouveau riche	Mr . Hardy inherits a large fortune and takes Mr . Laurel and his dog along to act as his butler - - - Mr . Laurel , that is . The Boys hadn't quite settled into their screen personae when this was made , so there is still a bit of backing and filling as Ollie comes home drunk and in high spirits on his birthday , while Stan tries to get him to bed and preserve his own self-esteem . There are a couple of amusing bits involving a dog and a fountain , but the lack of a common foe for their bumbling - - Charley Hall or Jimmy Finlayson , for example - - means that they wind up squabbling among themselves . Not among their best , but highly amusing on its own terms .
438903	1617546	15053	10.0	Laughing at Comedy	Richard Talmadge has just been thrown over by the seventeenth only girl he'll ever love and his father , who has just invented a clockwork death ray says he needs excitement . So when his father's secretary , who is a spy , steals the key part and Richard has to rescue it and pretty Eva Novak , Richard thinks it's all an act to pep him up - - and goes along with the gag . Talmadge started out as Douglas Fairbanks Sr . ' s stuntman , and his comedies - - of which this is the best - - are peppered with Fairbanks-style physical gags . Later , after his career as a movie lead faded out , he returned to being a stunt man and stunt director , in many ways paralleling the career of Yakima Canutt . But while neither became a huge star , they turned out some good movies and this one is a heck of a lot of fun .
439317	1617546	312544	10.0	General Panic	You're a star of silent short comedies and your first feature is a bomb . What do you you do ? You cut eighty percent of it and leave the good parts . That's what happened here . Apparently his feature , PLAY SAFE wasn't a draw at the theaters , so they cut out almost all the explication and left in just enough to set up a marvellous sequence in which Monty Banks chases after a runaway train in order to rescue his sweetheart . Beautifully timed and shot on site , this has an immediacy and reality that helps make great thrill comedy .
438966	1617546	465	10.0	Magical	One of Melies ' elaborate story productions , ranking with VOYAGE TO THE MOON , using camera tricks , sleight of hand , elaborate costumes and interesting model work . Technically it will look primitive to the modern eye - - the sets are clearly sets , the models clearly models - - but it is all done with Melies ' verve and dedication . Certainly , the grotto and underwater sets are beautiful ; he knew how to draw stonework . Melies , I feel , remains the most accessible of the oldest directors , in large part because of the sheer sense of showmanship and joy that is evident in these works . His scenes , when they are not sleight-of-hand magic , are essentially tableaux , punctuated by acrobats . His tableaux are much more elaborate than other directors who use the form , providing a feast for the eye . Working , as he does in this movie , with familiar images , he elaborates them , whereas in VOYAGE TO THE MOON , he invents them and suggest them . The effect is - - there is no other word for it - - magical .
439389	1617546	196220	10.0	Everything Worthwhile	Arnold Fanck started out as a geologist , but somehow became a director , first of documentaries , then in the creation of the genre of " Mountain Films " in which people go freeze their patooties off in the winter and thus reach a state of grace . It's a peculiarly German genre , although other people tried their hands at it from time to time . But here , in this semi-documentary about skiing , he certainly shows us everything worthwhile about it : beautiful pictures of snow-covered mountains , skiers flying over the heads of onlookers in slow motion - - everything that you might expect to see on The Wide World of Sports except for that guy who keeps falling off the mountain while the announcer intones " The Agony of Defeat ! " . There's a bit of a story tacked onto it , and thus it's an early stage in the evolution of the Mountain film , but the real point is to see the skiers in action . They're as good as they've ever gotten , and the editing is dynamite .
439267	1617546	222762	10.0	A Bedtime Story	Melies turned out a lot of poor movies in 1908 as he tried to compete with Pathe and Gaumont , who could outspend him , by sheer volume . Many of his surviving movies are , by today's standards , primitive slapstick , or unsubtly acted melodramas , shot far too simply to be interesting - - Griffith was learning his craft this year and would soon turn every convention on its head . But in the midst of this mass of poorly digestible slop , occasionally Melies made a beautiful picture , which even today speaks to us from one heart to another , in which his camera tricks and , to our eyes , odd film grammar add to our enjoyment , transporting us into a world that , seemingly , can't exist ; in VOYAGE DANS LA LUNE or VOYAGE A TRAVERS L'IMPOSSIBLE or LE ROYAUME DES FEES and others , he lets us enter this world , again and again . But in order to enter that world , we must set aside our modern , adult preconceptions of what is right and what makes sense . We must accept as truth , as we did when we were children , the fairy tales we were told . Then we can know right and wrong , and travel , with a guardian angel , into the realm of dreams . This was , alas , the final great example of this journey into wonder in Melies ' works . The competition was eating him alive at this point and he would basically shut down production in a couple of years , then be briefly revived for mechanical renditions of wonder only by the financial backing of his rivals , who would never even bother to release his last film . He would lose his beloved theater and his home , watch his primary prints be melted down for silver and to be made into boot heels during the First World War , and burn his backup copies in despair . He would be reduced to running a kiosk in a train station . In the 1920s , when the Parisian film clubs - - run by people like Rene Clair , tried to put together a show of Melies ' movies , they couldn't even be sure he was alive . He had disappeared like a devil in one of his stage magic films and only eight of his films could be located . Somehow , over the years , people have discovered others , in barns , in flea markets . . . fewer than 200 of his five hundred movies . Well , if we are missing much of the magic , at least some survives . Enjoy them all , good , bad , but never indifferent .
439497	1617546	228925	10.0	Molière	This is an excellent adaptation for the small screen of Molière's farce , with a fine cast headed by Donald Moffat in the title role , Tammy Grimes as the female lead and a young Victor Garber as one of the juveniles . Director Kirk Browning , a specialist in presenting theater on the small screen , keeps up visual interest by careful , slow-paced cuts and judicious , small camera movement to force the viewer's attention . The farce is funny , serious parts clear and if the ending is a deus ex machina , it was just the sort of ending to appeal to Molière's patron , the King of France . Moliere's satires are the glories of the French theater - - particularly if , like I , you have little taste for the solemn bombast of Racine . Here , his target is hypocrisy and the ability of scoundrels to hoodwink the well-meaning : at its premiere it provoked a firestorm of rancor from those who felt it mocked the Roman Catholic Church . Had it been done today , it might have been written with Tartuffe as a televangelist . Indeed , the point could have been made clear by doing it in a modern dress version . Browning and associates , however , decided to avoid cries of outrage by presenting it in period . Wiser , perhaps , than Moliere .
