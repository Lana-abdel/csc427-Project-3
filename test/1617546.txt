438587	1617546	306032	1.0	Sheesh !	I didn't know whether to give a 1 or a 10 to this short subject . It's so rotten it comes out on the other side as vastly entertaining . What the hey ! Miss New York only came in second , so I'll give it a 1 . David Selznick made this film for quick cash at the height of the Valentino craze and there are a lot more shots of Mr . Valentino than of the 88 women in this beauty pageant . Yes , that's what it is , a beauty pageant , with title cards that are meant to be witty , but come off sounding insane . This was the era of ballyhoo , after all , when you could become world famous for sitting on a flagpole . Not at all like our sober age . So you have Valentino , 88 pretty girls and New York City . What more could you want ?
439230	1617546	368384	1.0	It's All Symbolic	Yes , even the symbols are symbolic . What are they symbolic of ? Why , that is for you , the viewer to decide . What does this movie mean to you ? An utter waste of six minutes ? Then clearly , this movie was not meant for you . Why did you look at it ? Go look at something else .
438872	1617546	215573	2.0	Wrong Composition	As usual , Messrs . White and Heisse , the originators of the bad school of film making , have demonstrated in this film that they know nothing about composition . The train approaches the onlookers and the camera straight on and the right hand of the frame is wasted until the last moment of this film . Bad camera placement would be their stock in trade throughout their careers . Although I have blamed Mr . White for this habit in other reviews , the new EDISON : THE MOVIES BEGIN set of dvds from Kino credit the pair of them for many of the bad movies I have held Mr . White solely responsible for . As a final note , the movie going public of 1897 was , undoubtedly , aware of this failure . These actualities brought distant scenes to people who might never otherwise have seen them . And yet , considering that movies were in a slump during this period hardly seems coincidental to me . The audience may not have been consciously aware of this , but they stayed away in droves . And artists and photographers knew all about composition in this period .
438631	1617546	1103224	2.0	The Brains of a Dope	A married trapper wins the heart of an Indian maid and is married to her . After the wedding night he returns to his other wife and family . The Indian discovers this bigamy and determines to kill him , but seeing the love he has for her daughter , she jumps off a cliff instead , hoping to meet again in the " Happy Hunting Ground . " That silly plot sums up the basic problem of this movie , which survives in an excellent tinted print . The exteriors , shot in Fort Lee New Jersey , are fine . The interiors are clearly flats . Besides the problems with the plot , the acting , while clearly Griffith-influenced - - by this stage , what American film was not ? - - is broad to just shy of comedy ; and the direction has a fairly long sequence in which the trapper comes home and cuddles his his daughter and neither of them mention the Indian in the room , even though the daughter fully knows she is there .
439500	1617546	52636	2.0	And the point is . . . . ?	I think there is no point . This looks like a pilot for a one-hour war drama like COMBAT ! that never got beyond this stage . Filled with Cold War angst about the forthcoming Third World War , we watch as Americans with guns alternate with shots of Japanese with guns , eked out with occasional shots of palm trees , until the fighting is past . " Poor slobs " the Yanks announce about the dead Japs , until the Japs , not quite dead , start shooting . This is the earliest instance I have encountered of the Racially Integrated World War Two Combat Unit , which is a nice thing when it comes to acting jobs for Blacks and racial harmony , but is historically nonsense . U . S . military units were segregated by order of that great humanitarian Woodrow Wilson and integration did not begin to take place until an executive order during the Korean War by Harry Truman , alleged KKK member . Director Kowalski later went on to helm some good episodes of COLUMBO , so either this wasn't his m√©tier or he needed a decent script and actors or he learned how to direct as he went along . Whatever .
438640	1617546	309365	2.0	bad photography	By the time this was shot , the public was losing interest in simple vistas . This picture is also rendered almost unviewable by the poor , irregular lighting it was shot in . If you look at this hoping to see what the San Francisco landscape looked like before the Great Quake , this won't help you .
439137	1617546	12716	2.0	Anita Stewart is gorgeous	. . . and John Stahl knows how to direct , so there's plenty of interesting motion and posing . Once you have said that , you have exhausted the good points of this movie . Yes , Miss Stewart is gorgeous , but she can't act very well . The script is based on coincidences that are so flabbergasting as to defy the ability of the most credulous to to accept . Characters ' motivations are obscure because the dialogue in the titles don't make any sense , or perhaps it's the other way around . This movie is an utter and abominable piece of dreck . If anyone suggests you see it , kick him in the shins and run away . It was also produced by Louis B . Mayer . From this he wound up head of MGM , the most prosperous of the big studios . Go know .
439045	1617546	24510	2.0	Among the Worst Roach Movies	Well , some of the original Lonesome Lukes are pretty awful , and a couple of the Stan Laurel one-reelers are pretty bad too - - there's one in which the humor consists of everyone being Irish and bashing each other with bricks . But once you get past the initial gag in this movie , which is a typical piece of Del Lord destroying automobiles amusingly , this , the nominal last of the Taxi Boys series has Billy Gilbert going to a taxidermy shop - - he doesn't know the difference - - and getting involved with a twitchy Ben Blue in a scare-the-comics routine . Billy does some of his sneezing routine , but it doesn't look like they intended it for more than filling out a film that was running desperately short . Bad story line , bad continuity and even the special effects are fairly cheesy and obvious . It looks like they had already canceled the series before they made this one of scraps .
439034	1617546	236517	2.0	in a flop	First , I must tell you that I think Ben Turpin is one of the unfunniest screen comics in the history of the cinema . There are screen comics - - Larry Semon , for example - - who are complete nullities so far as I am concerned , but Ben Turpin's screen performances go beyond not funny into the realm of active terror . In the 1920s , when he had developed his cross-eyed gag , he was invariably cast in some horrific role , armed with a shotgun or performing delicate surgery . Some people must have thought it was funny , but it makes me want to flee the scene of the coming crime . However , even Ben Turpin had to start somewhere , and this is near the beginning of his on-screen career . He plays a young dandy in a world populated by women , all of whom he wants to tap on the shoulder and all of whom retaliate with traditional comic attacks , often involving seltzer bottles . There is little ornamentation of this basic gag and it goes on for the longest two or three minutes I have ever spent in a theater . Today he would be subject to a class action suit for sexual harassment . Too bad an audience has no such recourse .
438396	1617546	38953	3.0	Smarter than the narration	Interesting nature photography showing the first year of a life of a collection of fox kits , made ridiculous by being shown in double time and a ridiculously anthropomorphic narration . Turn the sound off on this one .
438767	1617546	51669	3.0	Much Ado About Nothing	This occasionally interesting story about a high school couple who get married and pregnant is written , directed and acted like a TV sitcom , with a supporting character who looks like a clean-cut Maynard G . Krebs , a father who does everything but pour steam out of his ears and lots of double takes and loud reactions . In the middle of this the highly professional cinematography of Benjamin Kline is occasionally jarringly beautiful and dramatic , particularly when he moves the camera to preserve composition . The net effect is neither funny , compelling or educational , but is a near-total misfire . Not bad enough to be interesting , not good enough to be watchable , no talent with a past or future except for Mr . Kline and Byron Foulger .
439259	1617546	8860	4.0	Girl , Not Lost , But Limber	The story is that Harold Lloyd abandoned his moderately successful ' Lonesome Luke ' character and started up his familiar ' Glasses ' character in order to do something different than the Chaplin-derived baggy-pants slapstick of the era . Well , if so , he still hadn't found his way yet to his classic comedies of the following decade . In this one , he and Snub going camping up in the wilds , where they run into bears , mountain lions , a skunk , and Bebe Daniels and her gun , who falls for Harold's City Slicker ways . There isn't much beyond a few mechanically executed gags and Snub shaking in terror at the mountain lion . One of the bears gives the most amusing performance in the movie . For completists only .
439470	1617546	30390	4.0	Movies on a Budget	Here is yet another entry in Fox's " Jones Family " series , which ran from 1936 through 1940 . In this one , the newlyweds are fighting over money issues and fast-talking semi-con man ' Uncle Charlie ' , played by Alan Dinehart is in town making trouble . As usual for a Fox B , the camera work by Edward Snyder - - who , after series ended , went into Fox's special effects department - - is top notch , but the script is workaday and the direction by Herbert Leeds is workaday at best . The line readings seem forced . Spring Byington is , of course , perfect in her role as as the Jones Family mother , but otherwise this one is pretty much of a mechanical yawn .
438779	1617546	370	4.0	Zip Zip Zip	Although the IMDb listing would have you believe this movie is 11 minutes in length , the DVD version of it as issued by the British Film Institute in 2006 times in at about three minutes - - - and there isn't time enough to tell the story in any meaningful way unless you know it - - stick with the 1951 version starring Alastair Sim is my advice . Nonetheless , this movie is interesting , because it may be the earliest use of titles I have ever seen in the movies . Although in coming decades movie titles would expand into dialogue , and the writing of concise and witty titles into a fine art , at this stage , the titles are actually just that : L brief chapter titles , describing the scene you are about to see . There are four of them .
438489	1617546	43632	4.0	Okay for pre-teen girls , I guess	This attempt to continue Margeret O'Brien's starring roles into her teens is completely unengaging to me - - although it is possible that in an earlier era , when magazines like TIGER BEAT appealed to pre-teens anxiously awaiting the onset of adolescence , it might have actually found an audience . But , speaking as a man in his fifties more than half a century later , it all seems too coy and calculated to be very interesting . Miss O'Brien's performance , as always , is excellent , but not at all suited to a comedy where she must carry the emotional weight herself - - her earlier roles , such as in MEET ME IN ST . LOUIS come off as comic because no one took her very seriously . Here it would require some very delicate work in all departments for the audience to care deeply about Miss O'Brien and yet not take her seriously , and it doesn't show up here .
438835	1617546	43499	4.0	Annoying	A great director , a wonderful cast , a skilled director of photography and lots of studio gloss results in a stinker of a movie , redeemed only by Clifton Webb's mugging and one medium-sized interaction by Evelyn Varden and Margalo Gillmore as they discuss small children . Otherwise this script is too studio bound , with the more interesting players stuffed into a car and Anne Francis - - looking gorgeous as always and particularly and appropriately vivacious , is stuck with William Lundigan , one of the more uninteresting leading men of the era . This is a great pity as I went in hoping and expecting to like this movie . But the script is pretty much of a stinker .
438589	1617546	45345	4.0	Ill-Humored Comedy	Slick , fast-paced unfunny romantic comedy as rich Peter Lawford and research doctor Gig Young don't exactly romance Jane Greer , but more accurately bid on her for her affections . Young seems grouchy at being in the picture , Lawford tries to get through his lines as fast as possible and Jane Greer seems to just want to leave the scene .
438703	1617546	14450	4.0	the evolution of Mr . Laurel	It's a gag comedy from 1923 that makes fun of the French Foreign Legion Stories of P . C . Wren . . . . or at least uses them as a jumping-off point . Stan shows up at a Foreign Legion post in a high-crowned hat , jacket and heavy mascara blotches under the eyes . He enlists , and then has a series of short comic takes which are executed with vigor , but not too much interest . He can't march in line with other legionaires , he squirts everyone with ten gallons of champagne from a bottle , he is sentenced to be shot and uses his blindfold to blow his nose . All of them are good gags , and were they strung together with plot or characterization , this would be a nice little comedy . Unhappily , they are not : things just happen . Perhaps it is because this print lacks most of its title cards . Mr . Laurel was still learning how to construct a film comedy at this point and it shows . Look at BEAU HUNKS instead .
438375	1617546	178811	4.0	Industrial Scenery	Although this piece is no masterpiece of the American cinema , it is worthy of some comment . It is one of a series of industrial films shot by Billy Bitzer ( later D . W . Griffith's cameraman ) at the Westinghouse works near Pittsburgh , one of the earliest examples of industrial film making . It was released by American Mutuscope & Bioscope , which produced Griffith's films from 1908-1913 . On those grounds , these pictures are worth at least a footnote . Technically , these films seem unremarkable today , but , comparing them with contemporary pieces from the Edison Company , we can see that Bitzer had an excellent sense of composition . This four-minute film is a sequence shot from the internal railroad at the Westinghouse Plant . When we compare it to ' Panoramic View Near Mt . Golden on the Canadian Pacific R . R . ' shot two years earlier by James White - - who had no sense of composition - - we see that whereas White fixed his camera to the front of the train and showed you the tracks with a little bit of scenery in the upper left corner , Bitzer's camera usually confines the view of the rails to a small part of the frame , while he pans slowly back and forth , showing you buildings , trees and so forth . While not tremendously interesting , vastly superior . Buildings are , after all , more interesting than railroad tracks . Nor is Bitzer afraid to move his camera casually . Edison's cameramen never did . They learned to cut , they told stories , oftentimes innovatively and brilliantly , especially Edwin S . Porter , but the camera remained fixed . It's not Lawrence of Arabia , but we can begin to see the part played by Bitzer in Griffith's rise . Griffith provided the stories and direction . Bitzer provided the ability to photograph them in an interesting fashion . The two would go on to make cinematic history .
439122	1617546	121608	4.0	The Buccaneer Act Three	What we have here is Demille's THE BUCCANEER showing just the highlights of the Battle of New Orleans and the celebratory party afterwards , with some fine color photography and no story . In 1939 this was a mildly interesting short subject of the American History as Hagiography type , but little else . Most of the story is told in pompous voice-over , with lines like " Only his deep loyalty to the American people " and " Andrew Jackson was the first president sprung from the common people and his door was always open to his friends . " I would suggest that you read a good book on the subject instead of wasting ten minutes on this effort .
439175	1617546	192129	4.0	Not good movies , mind you	Fat , lazy , petulant Hughie Mack is in danger of losing Lucille Lee Stewart because he keeps falling out of trees while trying to pick apples for her , so he takes boxing lessons and beats his opponents into the ground to win her heart - - or perhaps to indicate what he'll do to her if she doesn't marry him . Oh , you wacky comedian ! Although the best known comedies of this era are the fast paced slapsticks of Keystone , most other studios , Vitagraph among them , cultivated a slower , more ' situational comedy ' style of comedy . Vitagraph had the leading fat comic of the era , the incredibly popular George Bunny . Hughie Mack was their answer to Roscoe Arbuckle . Unfortunately for Hughie Mack , Arbuckle was possessed of enormous talent and Mack did not turn out particularly funny comedies . He did turn out to be a fine actor , working under von Stroheim in that director's dramas . This might be of interest for historical connections , but I doubt it . Give it a miss .
438463	1617546	35916	4.0	Nightmare Inducing	I have nightmares about this one . It's not enough that I walk about , my head pounding with a headache because I can't get Carmen Miranda singing " Paducah " out of my brain , but I keep seeing these bizarre Busby Berkley images in my mind , retreaded musical numbers from SUNNY SIDE UP . Avoid this one if you possibly can !
438913	1617546	23337	4.0	Ah , For Our Gang !	Bizarre little novelty short about a wagon train crossing the Plains , being stopped by the Indians . . . . and all the actors are little children in diapers ! One of a series directed by Charles Lamont before he hit it big at Universal . Notable for a young Shirley Temple as the girl tied to the stake by the Indians .
438542	1617546	30613	5.0	One of the Weaker Tashlins	Until the rise of Daffy Duck and Bugs Bunny at the very end of the 1930s , Porky Pig was Termite Terrace's biggest star , but he was largely a straight man . In this one he is a farmer doing his spring planting , beset by a lazy watch dog ( " I must be a watch dog - - I'm full of ticks " ) and raiding chickens . Part of my lack of enjoyment may be due to the poor coloring imposed on the print I saw . Tashlin tries his best , using some of his interesting compositions In the beginning scenes , while Porky is harrowing the ground before planting , he is shown in a tight shot from a very low angle - - almost a worm's-eye view . Tash would go from directing cartoons with very live-action compositions to live-action movies with very cartoonish set-ups . but this is not , alas , one of his better efforts .
438441	1617546	323580	5.0	The Great Marksman	There is a joke about a great marksman . When you came to his home , you found a fence with bulls-eyes painted on it and right in the middle of each bullseye is a bullet hole . A visitor asked the marksman how he came to be able to do that . " There's nothing to it , " said the marksman . " I fired the bullets into the fence and painted the bulls-eyes around the holes . " That's how I feel about most of Snub's leading comedies for Roach and this one in particular : Snub has shot a number of good gags into this movie , and executed them perfectly , and then written a plot to contain those gags . No one expects a comedy to be as closely reasoned and logical as a book by Heidigger , but it needs to make some sense . Perhaps it is the rushing to get from one joke to the next , but I don't find this to be more than adequate . On the other hand , the gags are good . And Marie Mosquini is a real cutie-pie .
439149	1617546	4484	5.0	Biograph After Griffith	By the time this Biograph came out , Klaw & Ehrlanger had taken over and D . W . Griffith had walked . And , while the people at Biograph had learned a lot of the mechanical lessons of Griffith's era - - the acting is fine , the cutting is fine , the crowd scenes are well done , and the composition uses the familiar ' Biograph Right Wall ' - - nonetheless , this is clearly not Griffith's work . What is missing is movement within the frame , the sophisticated complication of action that Griffith understood and which the unnamed director and cameraman did not , and the sense that the story is about more than story . As a result , it winds up looking like Griffith's work from 1909 , and unremarkable Griffith from that period . That being the case , this is a technically interesting movie , since it underscores what Griffith understood about film making that his contemporaries did not . If , however , you are interested in good movies , rather than seeing everything that Lionel Barrymore did , or the young Alan Hale , give it a miss .
439484	1617546	33265	5.0	Slow Vehicle	This rather poor RKO programmer manages to keep some interest going , mostly due to Fay Wray , who struggles with the poor material , but who is canny enough to make the most of her close-ups , and to Paul Guilefoyle who is pretty good is his supporting role as the hot-tempered moral center of the piece . Leading man - - actually , leading chump - - Charles Lang suggests , if anyone , a rather clueless Dan Duryea . The plot , about a struggling bus line , owned by Miss Wray's father and run by her , despite the efforts by wildcatters to put it out of business by faking accidents , has hints of screwball comedy about it at some points , but it is rarely played for laughs . Lang , the newly indigent ex-playboy , is down to his last limousine , which has its potential , but the effect is not funny , merely incongruous . Not a terrible piece to watch , but not to go out of your way for .
438983	1617546	11129	5.0	Not Really Felix	Although this appears as the second short on The Felix the Cat dvd collection , it does not resemble Felix particularly .

439379	1617546	415993	5.0	Bless Mickey Rooney	As I write this in 2007 , Mickey is still chugging along . One new appearance is already on the books for him in the IMDb , in the 82nd year of his movie career , He played midgets in the 1926 , was MGM's biggest star in the late 1930s and is still chugging along . Bless him . As to this short , it's nothing much : an attempt to compete with the enormous success of Hal Roach's OUR GANG series , using one of Fontaine Fox's comic strips ( he was best known for the Toonerville Trolley , and , indeed , this one takes place among the youngsters of that megalopolis ) that isn't very successful , because Mickey is about ninety per cent of the show and he's not good enough to carry a movie , even of this length , at this tender age . But bless him anyway .
438862	1617546	23764	5.0	What Went Wrong ?	There's some very good talent in front of the camera in this lighthearted movie about con men conning other con men ; and there are signs that someone who understood something about subtext had a hand in the script , as lies are expounded , confidences betrayed and reality starts to bend so much that you can't tell who is playing what . . . . when Walter Catlett impersonates Ed Wynn , Jerry Lester apes Jimmy Durante and someone who I don't recognize impersonates Julian Eltinge playing Mae West . . . . . then you're on the verge of something so strange that they might have invented screwball comedy a year before Howard Hawks birthed it in TWENTIETH CENTURY . . . . but someone pulled back , said we had to be sure the audience understands the envelope switch . . . . and turned what might have been great into another decent time waster . James Dunn is good , Joan Bennet is very good - - another talented actress that was used and ignored by all the critics because she had the misfortune to have a talent for comedy - - and Herbert Mundin is good . But you walk out of the theater frustrated .
439414	1617546	37373	5.0	Simple Answers For Complex Questions	The post-Lew-Ayres Dr . Kildare series sputters with Keye Luke and Van Johnson still competing to be Lionel Barrymore's assistant - - and each has to solve a medical mystery of his own choice . Meanwhile , various plots continue from earlier entries in the series , mostly comic . The series was winding down and only two more entries would come out , at two-year intervals . This episode is better than a couple of the polished stinkers that immediately preceded it . The comic relief does not overwhelm the movie , and the usual character actors are on hand in their series roles for your enjoyment and they also give you a young Ava Gardner , just another of the MGM contract players . Hubba Hubba . But the principal reason to watch these movies is , of course , Lionel Barrymore , always an enormously enjoyable and expert performer for any role . Unfortunately , he suffered badly from rheumatism and so he spent this entire series sitting down in a wheelchair . But standing or sitting , he's always good to watch .
439295	1617546	37799	5.0	Not George , Anyway	This tightly plotted story about how George gets involved in a murder as a suspect and victim is efficiently directed , as one would expect from a farce with Marcel Varnel at the helm . However , George Formby's usual charm is largely absent from this movie . Part of the reason is that some of the plot is put into motion by George's lies . But , the majority of the distaste I have is that George's goal is to be a star on the stage , which he is evidently unfitted for . In other movies his goals are ones he can obviously attain , once given an opportunity : to win an auto race or become a newspaper photographer . Not here : George , in the body of the story , anyway , is blissfully free from talent . But Varnel's style of story is cut-glass farce : his best work was with Will Hay and the Crazy Gang . George Formby's appeal lay in other directions and although he can carry out standard farce , it's a waste for him to do so , like sitting Frank Sinatra down at a piano and telling him to play . George does get to perform three songs , including one of his better ones , " He Was Such a Daring Young Man . " Also giving a good performance is Ian Fleming as an unflappable police inspector , but they can't really make this a good movie .
438998	1617546	22135	5.0	Doesn't Age Well	Edgar Selwyn , one of the people who actually founded the studio that would become MGM ( " Goldwyn " was originally an amalgamation of his and his brother's name with co-owner Samuel Goldfish , who liked it so well he renamed himself after the studio ) , directed this rather stagy version of a story about fidelity and infidelity among the well-to-do . Norman Foster , who would go on to become a good B director , is fairly weak and most of the players are rather mannered in their performances . As usual , Adolph Menjou gives a fine performance as Tony Minot , a philanderer who only falls in love with married women . Harold Rossen as the DP does his usual fine job , moving the camera around lightly to maintain composition . The palette , though , is that stark black-and-white that makes everything look as if the film had been overdeveloped . MGM would abandon it in a couple of years
438469	1617546	22798	5.0	Dance Movie Without Dancing	James Dunn and Sally Eilers form a dance team , but we see little dancing : the director has ace cinematographer James Wong Howe concentrate on their faces and for their one big number , they are replaced by uncredited doubles . Dunn was a hoofer , but obviously neither was up to it . The story is much darker than one would expect from a musical . There is a suicide offstage and old vaudevillians who can't get a booking . Dunn and Eilers are good but not great . Of more importance is Howe's low-key lighting as they achieve success and lose each other . It was an annoyance that much of the print was out of focus until the last ten minutes , but in some ways it actually focuses you on the shapes ! Not worth seeing except for fans - - at least until they find a good print !

Or something like that . So it's time to set off some Roman candles and drive Papa barmy . All very amusing , I suppose , if it's this or the Ham & Bud show down the street , but it's been done before and better . And remember kids : don't shoot Roman candles at your parents at home !

438372	1617546	201580	5.0	Lifeless	Literal version of one of the lesser Holmes stories does not translate well to the silent screen .

438602	1617546	1263	5.0	Survive and Is Seen	I had the pleasure of seeing this film tonight at MOMA , where , Mr . Anderson notes in his comments , it survives . It is a silly , rather obvious film as Miss Talmadge ( who is as startlingly beautiful with long braids as she would be in a plain white apron 15 years later - - beauty is beauty ) plays a princess who doesn't wish to get married to the prince from the kingdom across the tracks , nor does he want to wed her . They exchange miniature portraits , during the posing of which they each make faces . Horrified , they run away from he afternoon in disguise , meet each other , fall in love and return home to get married . No real surprise there . John Bunny , who would shortly become the first American comedy star has a supporting role in this movie as one of the kings . The actors perform their roles competently and charmingly .
439351	1617546	249758	5.0	First LKO picture	Henry ' Pathe ' Lehman had a checkered career . He got his start in the movies by telling D . W . Griffith he was off the boat from Europe , claiming he had been a director for Pathe Freres . While working for Sennett , he was possibly the first Chaplin imitator on film . Within a year he had used his credentials to get his own studio , trying to out-Sennett Sennett . He lost it in a couple of years , but the name continued on through the end of the decade . Then when the Arbuckle scandal broke , he called a press conference and claimed that he was the fianc√© of Virginia Rappe , the girl whose death had triggered the entire event . The lies he told contributed to the rage that surrounded the entire affair . In the meantime , we have this movie to consider . It stars Billy Ritchie , an ex-Karno comic who claimed he was not a Chaplin imitator and that , indeed , Chaplin stole his character . There is some fun in a rough way , but the bone-breaking slapstick is not tempered by the sort of brilliant editing that Sennett's crews could perform . Ritchie is interesting , but the entire thing is clearly a rip-off .
438853	1617546	1469	5.0	Random Adventures	This is a lesser example of Griffith's series of shorts concerned with social problems , like WHAT SHALL WE DO WITH OUR OLD ? and ONE IS BUSINESS , THE OTHER CRIME . It is , according to its first title , " suggested by Press Comment on the Tramp Evil . " Billy , a poor bootblack , played by Edna Foster , decides to try finding a town where business is better . On the road he meets with two tramps , played by Donald Crisp and Joseph Graybill . They force him to beg for him , and then kill and rob an old man . At this point , Billy protests and they decide to kill him . They lock him in a shack while they decide which of them is to do the evil deed . Billy is rescued when a friendly dog carries a plea to help to a rich family in the neighborhood . They subdue the tramps and adopt Billy . Some of what I consider to be weakness in the story - - the randomness of the tramps ' crimes - - may well be an artifact of the short length of this film and the contemporary view of tramps . It may also be an attempt to tell the story from Billy's point of view , in which adults ' actions seem capricious . Also , Griffith offers no clear solution to the problem ; but he never did . He always seemed more interested in stating a problem than solving it . In any case , this particular short , while done well enough , suffers from these , in my opinion , uncertainties . While not bad , it is certainly understandable that this is not one of Griffith's better-known pieces .
439253	1617546	21978	6.0	Creaky creepy	Creaky but interesting melodrama powered by Walter Huston's performance as a brute and a dynamite action ending . Although Wyler's direction is not as sure as it would be later , it is interesting to note that , for the most accomplished studio director of all time , a man said to operate without a style of his own , a lot of images that show up in his later films ( particularly WUTHERING HEIGHTS and THE LITTLE FOXES ) also show up here .
438578	1617546	37167	6.0	Silly fun	Googily little wartime fantasy about a cleaning lady who , convinced a lucky charm owned by her late husband ( played in two photographs by an uncredited Charles Laughton , Lanchester's real-life husband ) will keep her from harm , goes to Berlin to " give that blooming Mr . Hitler what for . " Ably supported by a cast of first-rate comics , particularly Lumsdale Hare and Fritz Feld , it still requires Miss Lanchester at her most wide-eyed to pull this one off .
439255	1617546	23601	6.0	As portrayed by Tom Brown and Culver	Interestingly conceived but erratically realized mixture of melodrama and documentary as the American Legion pays for a scholarship to Culver Military Academy for Tom Brown in honor of his Medal-of-Honor-winning father . The script is a little too neat and episodic , however , and apparently the young actors were not up to Wyler's 90 takes to get the scenes right , so some of the scenes are a bit misjudged . Watch for an incredibly young Tyrone Power Jr . in his screen debut and an uncredited and very funny cameo by Eugene Palette .
439271	1617546	223506	6.0	God Looks Out for Fools and drunks	Apparently a variation on LA CHUTE DE CINQUIEME ETAGE , this one is about a drunk who throws his wife and family out of the window - - at least apparently since the first half is not known to survive . Then , in sorrow , he tries to hang himself . Although Melies is primary remembered for his flights of fantasy and feats of magic , he turned out a fair number of serious pieces , including a series of shorts about the Dreyfus Affair in 1899 ; and some of his fantasies had serious undertones to them . It's interesting to see this straight-out piece of melodrama . This is one of the many previously lost or infrequently seen Melies pictures that have been made available by Serge Bromberg , David Shepherd and a myriad of other hands in the newly issued DVD set GEORGES MELIES : FIRST WIZARD OF CINEMA . Required viewing for anyone interested in the history of movies . . . . . and a lot of fun .
438810	1617546	212015	6.0	Have to Watch My Language	Ralph Bakshi , watch out ! Almost half a century before FRITZ THE CAT , there was a flourishing pornographic movies industry - - Johann Schwartzer in Austria was producing the equivalent of dirty French postcards in Austria , suitable for smokers . This is a pornographic cartoon , with sexual members that detach themselves , crabs , and it ends with a cartoon reenactment of the sort of donkey show that I saw in Tijuana in 1970 , only with a jenny instead of a jackass . The result is a cartoon of more interest to historians of movies than a teenage boy looking at sexually-oriented manga , although doubtless this played in smokers in the 1920s and 1930s .
438989	1617546	32511	6.0	The Crazy Gang	This wartime farce concerns the Crazy Gang - - you may think of them as a precursor of the ' Carry On ' series , if you like - - who get involved in World War Two , which for them means running a fish and chips shop off a barrage balloon , floating accidentally into Germany , being interned in a concentration camp , acting as Hitler doubles and escaping . Don't worry if it makes no sense , it's the Crazy Gang , meaning about eight music hall performers taking every opportunity to engage in pratfalls , puns , cowardice and risqu√© jokes . The Crazy Gang starred in something short of a dozen movies in the late 1930s and early 1940s , a sort of all-star supporting comics ' series . The director of this and other movies in the series was French-born Marcel Varnel , a specialist in high-speed farce for Gaumont and Gainsborough until his untimely death . When he worked with Will Hays and his group of comics - - Moore Marriott appeared in both series - - he produced some very fine situational farces . Here , in this looser-plotted work , with every comic fighting for screen time , the result is something that would have been a very popular home film in Britain , but which does not , alas , travel well in time or space to a modern American viewer like me .
439439	1617546	12631	6.0	No Context for Review	Let us imagine you are someone from Japan who enjoys a lot of different films . You like American films , and have seen several hundred of them , mostly westerns , but only about twenty made before 1945 . You've seen almost all the pictures that Frank Capra directed from 1928 on , one non-Capra drama from 1926 - - let us say , FLESH AND THE DEVIL - - and enjoyed it , thinking it full of weird and wonderful images , and then you are confronted with a melodrama from 1921 . I submit you may like it or not like it , but you have little context to understand whether it is good or bad , either innately or for the year 1921 . It might be Ingram's FOUR HORSEMAN OF THE APOCALYPSE or it might be an utter piece of hackwork . Well , that's my problem with SOULS ON THE ROAD . I like Japanese films , but more than half of them have been Samurai flicks . I have seen a about ten of Ozu's silent films and one silent drama from 1926 . So what can I tell you about this movie ? I can tell you that , by and large , I thought it interesting , but the style of acting is not something I can comment on . Characters ' motivations are not clear - - the main character has suffered a nervous breakdown , but we're not sure of the pressures that led to it - - and they maintain their positions until something drastic happens . People do things for the sake of the plot , seemingly to illustrate the story's moral , not because of who they are . Perhaps to a Japanese audience of 1921 , motivations and actions would be clearer . Is it a good movie ? Is it a good movie for a 1921 Japanese production ? I don't know . I enjoyed it , but in large part I enjoyed it because it helps fill in a little of my background of Japanese films . I have a somewhat academic appreciation of early film and can spend hours pleasurably looking at Zecca experiments in scene changes or industrial films of Westinghouse factories . You probably can not . . . . but then , you're reading this review , are you not ?
439217	1617546	270474	6.0	Country & Western Music	One of the numerous musical short subjects that the movie studios churned out , this one purports to offer you a sampling of Western songs from the old west and modern musical westerns : " Home on the Range " , " Oh , Susannah " , " My Little Buckaroo " and " Deep in the Heart of Texas " are offered for your enjoyment . All are offered as little vignettes ; " My Little Buckaroo " is a clip from a Dick Foran musical Western . Such featurettes were common to movie theaters . Indeed , photographs of early movie theaters advertise sheet music and performances ; and Max Fleischer began his famous ' Follow the Bouncing Ball ' series of cartoon sing-alongs in 1926
439127	1617546	22219	6.0	Sound !	Antediluvian soundie cannot do justice to the enormous talent of Washington . Although the picture is sharp and the composition is excellent , Washngton's voice is washed out as he sings the title song while lounging against a tree and his ' mammy ' berates him into getting a job moving empty crates in Harlem .
438873	1617546	208771	6.0	As the Title	Louis Feuillade was Gaumont's lead director for a decade or two from about 1907 and he directed many of his pieces with a casual haste that resulted in some fascinating cinematic moments : pulling an exact duplicate of the woman you've just kidnapped out of a trunk , or going to your lawyer by balloon may be offered to the audience as if such are everyday occurrences . What did the audience think ? When you're having a good time , you're likely to forgive small random gaffes . Most of his comedies were short , and contained one or two gags , elaborated by repetition until the film was used up . Sometimes it worked , sometimes it didn't , but when a film lasts five minutes and there are several more of similar length on the program , you're willing to put up with a dud . So this simple movie isn't much , but for what it is , it is fine . Bout-de-Zan hooks up with a circus elephant and the elephant becomes the star of the movie . There's an amusing bit in which Bout-de-Zan and the elephant scare off a fake blind man and take over his pitch . The casual acceptance of the situation by passersby and their donations is amusing . Later , we see the elephant eat with a fork . Not much to it , but who doesn't like elephants ?
439136	1617546	8550	6.0	Spy Stuff	This is a static but watchable story of beautiful German spy Florence Vidor , caught between clueless Jack Holt and wily Sessue Hayakawa . The men are trying to protect information about a convoy in the Pacific where a new German submarine force is rampaging - - remember , this is World War One , and the Japanese were on our side - - and Vidor is trying to find out about it , while fighting her feelings as Jack Holt keeps proposing to her . Mr . Holt , in the tradition of all heroes , is a bit musclebound between the ears , while Hayakawa's intelligence shines through . Despite the motionlessness of the camera , well composed shots and skilled actors keep this one moving along . Charles Ogle is a bit over the top of Vidor's ruthless doctor / spymaster , but in a movie like this , some one has to be .
438446	1617546	330107	6.0	Kids Type the Darnedest Things	Louis Feuillade was Gaumont's director of whatever they needed directing for a couple of decades from about 1907 : classic serials such as JUDEX and LES VAMPIRES , melodramas of all lengths , slapstick comedies and kiddie comedies , particularly those of the Bout Le Zan series . In this one , Bebe is a child actor in a kiddie comedy , pinched , along with the director , because a lot of " cinematic artists " have been running con games , stiffing restaurant bills , and so forth , and they are hauled into the nearest police precinct and put into the hands of a prefect who has had enough of this sort of nonsense . The humor in this short , as in several of Feuillade's kiddie comedies , arises from his children behaving in very unchildlike fashion . Worth looking at once for the pleasure of the joke
438722	1617546	29657	6.0	Quick Fun	An amusing runaway - heiress - and - newspaperman comedy ( think IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT without Capra , Riskin , great actors or Harry Cohn ) , this second feature times in at pretty close to an hour and seems to be all right . Perpetual lunk Gordon Jones is fine as the eccentric newspaper photographer , but Betty Furness can't speak her overwritten lines with any conviction . Indeed , the entire movie seems a bit overwritten , possibly to give the leads some interesting characters they couldn't manage on their own . Witticisms such as " I know a good seven letter word for good-bye : GOODBYE " abound . As usual , the fun in these movies is supplied by the supporting cast , including Henry Kolker , Franklin Pangborn and E . C . Clive . It will give you something to do while the plot is lumbering along its inevitable course .
439144	1617546	36317	6.0	Their Best Comedy - - Don't Cry If You Miss It	Carney and Brown were two minor supporting comedians whom RKO teamed , hoping for the same chemistry - - and profits ! - - that Universal was getting out of Abbott and Costello . But whereas A & C were two guys who had spent twelve years honing their act and timing , this pair had to move on their acting ability , which was decent , and their chemistry - - which , alas , was non-existent . Strangely enough , this , their cheapest feature - - no supporting acts , no songs - - is , I think , their best . I credit Leslie Goodwins , the director , who usually spent his time in the shorts department directing Leon Erroll and Edgar Kennedy shorts . There are some very funny gags scattered about . A surprising amount of comic energy is supplied by Erford Gage , who plays their sergeant in this and ADVENTURES OF A ROOKIE . He also gets to pull the best gag in the movie , something you'd expect to see in a Merrie Melody . So this movie is not a waste of time . But it does make you appreciate Abbott and Costello all the more .
439068	1617546	311754	6.0	Earning Some Cabbage	At this stage in their careers , Lloyd Hamilton and Bud Duncan were a comedy team for Kalem , Ham and Bud . Playing two vicious tramps , they wandered into depressing situations , created some chaos and left . This was supposed to be funny . Usually it wasn't . According to stories , the two men hated each other and the team broke up in 1917 when Kalem starting breaking up with the ending of the Patents Trust . Hamilton developed into one of the most respected performers of silent comedy in the 1920s and drank himself to death in the 1930s . Duncan inexplicably kept working for another thirty years . Surprisingly this is actually a watchable comedy from this period . Although , like most of their films , it is composed of simple variations on a single theme , watching the pair of them make and toss around sauerkraut , wrecking everything in the process is actually fairly amusing . I see than Hamilton is credited as director on this one , and assume that he was able to impose some humor into the situation that I can enjoy without being able to understand . Maybe they were having fun trying to kill each other . I certainly appreciate the attempt .
439422	1617546	18516	6.0	Directed by William Wyler	Decent entry in the late silent series of Mountie shorts starring Cobb , this has a little more actual acting than most entries in this series - - when they ran thin on inspiration in these shorts , they simply had the actors move slower , but not in this entry . If , like me , you're an admirer of William Wyler , you'll want to take a look at this . If not , you can skip it unless you have a hankering for leather hats .
438883	1617546	163767	6.0	Differences	It is always a fascinating conundrum for me to look at early Japanese films , because there are so many differences from the way their American equivalents would be done . Technically , this is much more elaborately drawn and backgrounded than an American cartoon would be in the era , but the animation is not as sophisticated : the characters don't seem to be as fully articulated as American animators would make them , As for the story itself , it seems to be a Japanese fairy tale or perhaps children's fantasy , just the sort of thing that American animators would turn their hands to when feeling ambitious . But the details are at once fascinating and confusing . Momotaro , the hero of the story , is born out of a giant peach his foster mother finds floating on the river . Is this any odder than , say , the origin of Thumbelina ? No , indeed , But even so , I cannot but help and wonder : why a Peach ? Well , someday I may find out . In the meantime , this is a fascinating glimpse into the early roots of Japanese animation and the folks at Digital Meme are to be commended for making it available on DVD .
438574	1617546	368164	6.0	Jumping at Lightning	This is one of Charley's Jimmy Jump one-reelers , produced when he was re-establishing himself as an on-screen presence , but before he went to his beautifully constructed two-reelers . As a result , the characterization and plot are cut down to a bare minimum and the result , while sustained by his wonderful gag construction , is not particularly remarkable . In this one he is a lightning rod salesman out west . His gags are funny - - he and Eddie Baker have a great sequence passing an incriminating wallet back and forth , but the overall effect is a bit too rushed . While I enjoyed it , it is not a good vehicle to showcase Chase to someone unfamiliar with him .
438994	1617546	16894	6.0	What , no entertainment ?	Decent if not brilliant , this social comedy for Leatrice Joy is a bit of a disappointment , alas . It does turn the standard ' boy meets girl , boy loses girl , boy gets girl ' plot on its head in an amusing way : Clive Brook is newly divorced and paying more alimony to Lilyan Tashman than he makes when he meets Leatrice Joy in a fine ' meet cute ' scene . So the object of the entire movie is to lose the girl - - in this case , Tashman . Unfortunately , the middle of the picture sags : what should be played at high speed with fast cuts for door-crashing farce is played at a moderate pace for little impact . And Brook is pretty much of a stiff all the way through . Joy is fun . however , and Tashman too , as is Casson Fergusson as a sheik with a receding hairline and no chin . What is notable about this film is its easy acceptance , in the mid-20s , of women's rights - - and duties . Hubby Brook is not bringing in enough money to make ends meet , so Joy goes out and gets a job without batting an eye . Alas , this sort of attitude vanished with the years : a decade and a half later , when Stevens directed WOMAN OF THE YEAR for Metro , the big scene was the one in which Hepburn tried to make breakfast and failed miserably - - thereby demonstrating that she was not a real woman . I think I prefer this movie .
438775	1617546	34572	6.0	Chester Morris Makes This One	This WWII story of melting pot recruits - - in this case , bomber pilots - - has all the usual wisecracks , including the one about Brooklyn - - is perfectly ordinary . Chester Morris , who is usually good , is particularly good in this one with his usual straightforward performance . This is the sort of movie that made John Wayne and Randolph Scott superstars , but Morris was a little too old , lacked momentum in his career - - he had already spent too many years in B pictures - - and so never escaped . He would shortly go into the Boston Blackie series and while he would work steadily and well through his death - - right up through his role in THE GREAT WHITE HOPE in 1970 - - his career would not provide many high spots . Still , if you haven't seen too many movies of this sort , you might enjoy this as much as I did .
438518	1617546	56016	6.0	Hurrah for supporting actors	Well meaning but wooden story of how Geronimo , with fifty Apaches , came to stand off the U . S . Army . Chuck Conners gives a creditable performance as a wooden Indian , and his soon-to-be real life wife plays the woman who loves him . Most amusing for Ross Martin as a wise-cracking sidekick and Adam West , four years before he became a wooden Batman , as a sympathetic army officer .
439125	1617546	346008	7.0	Why a Duck ?	Because they couldn't afford to get Eddie Cantor , I guess , for this landmark film of a live duck singing " Ma , He's Making Eyes at Me " . What ? A film of a singing duck is a landmark ? Yes , because it is one of the earliest sound films in what became the Movietone process , the sound-on-film method that has been the standard since about 1935 . The method was developed by Theodore Case and this actually very amusing vaudeville bit makes a good test for synchronization of movement and sound , an issue that the competing system , the Vitaphone sound-on-disk method had from the beginning . SPOILER ALERTActually , the duck doesn't sing the song . Gus Visser does , and the duck just quacks at the appropriate moments . What are the appropriate moments ? I suppose you'll have to see the film to find out !
438831	1617546	487661	7.0	Welcome to Our Hearts Again , Iolanthe	This elaborate and well-staged silent version of Hertz ' play is exceedingly well produced for 1913 : it starts off by introducing the actors by name and role , then showing them in double exposure in street clothes and in costumes . The production values are also elaborate and the look of the set designs reminds one of the elaborate backdrops that Melies used in his shots . However , it also shows the problems that afflicted Thanhouser : the shots are long , static , and all too often , tightly , almost claustrophobically blocked . The acting is stage acting , and even though care is taken with crowd compositions , the effect is occasionally jarring . Still , the elaborate sets and costumes , as well as the fun of the story moves things right along . Very worthwhile for anyone interested in the evolution of the American movie in this critical period .
438975	1617546	358	7.0	An interesting bypath	An early attempt by Zecca , Pathe's leading director in this period , at scene changes . All of them are done by fade . This technique would be abandoned , resulting in the standard French look through the 1920s , most notably in Louis Feuillade's movies , in which the camera sits in one location . The result is a much more subjective camera than the typical American style .
439111	1617546	25768	7.0	Over the top with technicolor	Someone was foolish enough to give Leon Erroll technicolor and a decent budget , so he spent it . You don't see chorines wearing purple any more , and more's the pity , say I . Erroll milks the gags for all they are worth .
438701	1617546	14606	7.0	The wages of sin in eighty minutes	Welcome to the world of Tod Browning , a world of sideshows and thieves , vampires and murderers , where men cut off their arms for love and wear dresses for revenge , the world of Dracula and FREAKS . Browning was a true original . He had a long association with Lon Chaney that ended only with death . In Browning's world , people pretend to be other than they are , but they rarely know who they are until it is too late . There are considerable problems with the story as told , probably due to the fact that the movie was shelved for a couple of years and then had the titles rewritten anonymously . I strongly suspect that the relationships between the three leads was a lot more sexual in Browning's script than they are here . In short , this is a bizarre movie and the main actors in it - - Wallace Beery , Raymond Griffith and Priscilla Dean play bizarre characters manipulated by a bizarre fate . Perhaps you don't believe in fate . If not , you may find this movie a mess of wild coincidences . But if you accept Browning's vision , you will find yourself drawn along . There is a happy ending tacked on , for those of you who like happy endings . The rest of us will ignore it .
439473	1617546	20103	7.0	The Moving Camera	George Fitzmaurice was one of the great commercial stylists among directors in the 1920s . He suffered an eclipse in the early talkie era but was fighting his way back into the majors when he died in 1940 . This means , of course , there are a lot of problems with this movie . The screen actors don't know how to do dialogue and most of the stage actors don't know how to turn down their performances for the intimacy of the movie camera . Barbara Stanwyck , looking very fresh-faced , is very loud in her line readings . She knows how to show her emotions beautifully already , though . But producer Joe Schenck didn't spare any expense behind the camera , and it shows . Avant-garde cameraman Ray June moves the camera about impeccably , despite the fact that no one else bothered . While other directors were having their cameramen use cuts to change subjects , Fitzmaurice has June move the camera . Notice the long tracking shot at the bar in the opening sequence , and the MOS shots used to fill out the sequence . The camera-work is not fluid . It is , frankly , fairly clunky , but it is light years ahead of anyone else in the business in 1929 , except possibly Mamoulian's APPLAUSE . So while their are a lot of problems with this movie , the camera-work makes this one very superior for 1929 and Barbara Stanwyck makes it worth looking at .
438993	1617546	10729	7.0	Plot Twists Aplenty	A rich young man checks into a hotel room to commit suicide , when his design is thwarted by blackmail and murder in the room opposite his - - elaborately staged for his benefit . Why does he wish to kill himself ? Is the confidence game being run on him as simple as it seems ? Don't make your mind up too soon . Scriptwriter Jules Furthman - - the favorite screenwriter , in coming days , of Josef von Sternberg and Howard Hawks - - and director Henry King - - two years before his classic TOL'ABLE David - - concocted an entertaining journeyman work for the William Russell unit of Flying A - - one of companies releasing through Mutual in this period . By the standards of the period , this was a superior programmer , perhaps a touch overlong , but still well worth your time if you get a chance to see it .
438588	1617546	288252	7.0	Dystopian Comedy	Amusing little fantasy about a man who buys an artificial arm and discovers it picks everyone's pocket . Blackton was a leading exponent of trick shots in early American films - - like Melies , he had been a stage magician , and the stop-motion effects are slickly done .
439052	1617546	303271	7.0	The World is About To End . Should I Mow the Lawn ?	This short subject , which starts off with a picture of a mushroom cloud arising from a nuclear explosion , is produced by " The National Clean Up - Paint Up - Fix Up Bureau " - - with of course , the cooperation of the Federal Civil Defense Administration . In an era when they exposed soldiers to atom bombs to study effects - - indeed , a couple of years before Howard Hughes imported sand from atomic testing sites for studio retakes of THE CONQUEROR , eventually resulting in the death by cancer of Dick Powell and the removal of one of co-star John Wayne's lungs - - this seemed sensible . In retrospect it looks like a parody of itself - - will a semi-gloss or a latex best resist the end of the world and should I use a white undercoating ? Or would wallpaper do a better job ? Maybe one of the Morris prints which uses lots of green arsenic for the nursery . In the meantime , you'd better throw out those old newspapers because when they drop the Bomb next door , they will burst into flames and lower real estate values . But , in many ways , B movies and industrial films provide us with the best view of contemporary thought from an era . For a major picture , you have many bright people laboring intensively to make every choice . For something like this , it's a matter of getting it today , not right , and so the casual easy choice that reveals the habits of the era is the one taken . So while you're busy laughing your head off at the stupidity of people more than half a century ago - - and trying hard not to think of what people will think about us in another half century - - consider this from a sociological viewpoint , if you would .
439013	1617546	224240	7.0	Religious FIlms	Having invented the trick film and the stag film ( with the same year's APRES LE BAL ) , Melies also pioneered the religious film , with this account of the temptation of St . Anthony , using the same sort of camera tricks he was using for his magic works . But I wonder : what was the placement order of his catalogue ? Did this come immediately after APRES LE BAL ? This is one of the many previously lost or infrequently seen Melies pictures that have been made available by Serge Bromberg , David Shepherd and a myriad of other hands in the newly issued DVD set GEORGES MELIES : FIRST WIZARD OF CINEMA . Required viewing for anyone interested in the history of movies . . . . . and a lot of fun .
438415	1617546	248018	7.0	Forgotten Comics	This is a lesser but still very amusing short from Charley Chase's peak period : an ex-girlfriend of Charley's moves into his building with a new husband , and neither Charley's wife nor the new husband are happy with the situation . Modern viewers might be confused by some of the 1920s dialogue ( " I haven't seen you since Heck was a wienie " may need to be explained ( see below ) and there's a tremendous amount of sexual symbolism involving feet , socks and garters that don't add much to the usual visceral humor , even if they work together well for ex-lit majors like me . As for the confusing bit of dialogue quoted above , there is a phrase " A dog's age " for a long time . This gave rise to " since Hector was a pup " and since frankfurters are sometimes called " hot dogs " and sometimes " wienies " ( from Vienna sausages ) and thus this particular bit of snappy dialogue . As already said , amusing if not Chase's best . Don't start your friends on this one , but if they like his silent comedies , give it a well deserved shot .
438741	1617546	49037	7.0	Amusing Novelty	I've enjoyed some pretty strange musical novelty acts over the years , from the South Minneapolis Bassoon Quartet to Peter Schickele's annual presentation of P . D . Q . Bach , but this short about an all-harmonica orchestra , is a pip ! Dozens of harmonicas from tiny ones that a baby could swallow through triplex monsters a foot in length provide a lot of variation and a surprisingly full sound . Visually , director Negulesco shows his usual flair , filling the numbers with blackout productions and a snappy dance to " Begin the Beguine " - - no Artie Shaw , but quite good . and a lot of his signature silhouette shots . Also , notice the way he takes care to shoot the harmonicas to emphasize hand movements .
438785	1617546	222943	7.0	Magic Show	One of Melies ' movie versions of magic shows : in this one he turns fires into women in spangly dresses - - one yellow and one blue in the hand-tinted version I saw - - and then turns them back into a fire . Although this lacks either the elaborate background and miniature work of his well-known pieces from this period - - VOYAGE A LA LUNE for example - - or the elaborate costumery of such works as LES CARTES VIVANTES , this is still a fine little programmer by the standards of 1904 , with Melies ' usual , well-executed camera trickery . It must have been quite a wow for the audience of the period and if , more than a hundred years later , it lacks any oomph that would make you seek it out - - unless , like me , you're a sucker for everything Mleies - - it still is a fine show of what the leading cineaste of the period was doing .
438894	1617546	21500	7.0	Not a Singing Cowboy	. . . . But a surprisingly good off-kilter Wester as the hero bails out a show of jazz chorines and helps them put on a show . There are some fairly good musical interludes , including the surprisingly sweet " Underneath Montana Skies " and Slim Summerville is in his usual reliable form as comedy relief .
439394	1617546	270325	7.0	Away , Dull Care	Before Larry Semon's movies became repetitive , increasingly bloated efforts that starred him and only him , he turned out some very nice slapstick with a large crew of comedians who got some good screen time and gags , and featuring some very good cinematography . This is one of those efforts , featuring a loving little zoom shot , a slammed-door farce sequence using cuts - - a technique I have not noticed before but which works very well - - and graceful composition , as well as the sort of work that seems to improve as it gets older - - a chiaroscuro that comes out in multi-generational prints . I'm not exactly sure what is going on here , except it involves Semon as a detective trying to deal with some roughnecks but there is some lovely by play with Oliver Hardy , who even does some tie-less twiddling , eight years before he was teamed up with Stan Laurel . You can see some of the rot setting in , the bigger explosions , the near-collisions undercranked to produce greater speed . But for the moment , it is still working .
438807	1617546	6102	7.0	The Pride of the Firm	Ernst Lubitsch , later one of the great directors of the cinema , started out in films as a ' Jewish Comedian . ' However , this movie is not a farce , but the story of how a clumsy young man from the sticks - - when we first see him , he is a window dresser in a dry goods shop who breaks the window - - through push and hard work , changes through hard work and the advice of the girl he loves . When we first see him , he is an ugly young man with a mop of unruly hair who does not know how to dress . By the end of the movie , he is a distinguished-looking man on his honeymoon . This is not a farce , but Lubitsch manages to get in a few comic touches , playing his character as sly and cowardly , but sweet . There is some very nice photography , thanks to Danish cinematographer Axel Graatkjaer , and leading lady Martha Kriwitz as charming as Lubitsch's distaff Pygmalion . These make it a better than average picture for the era .
438508	1617546	19209	7.0	Pushing Leather	Reginald Denny first came to the attention of the movies in the ' Leather Pushers ' series of shorts about a young boxer and his associates and this story of a young boxer who is comically corrupted by New York night life and a young woman down on her luck is handled in a very amusing and telling manner by director Fred Newmeyer . Newmeyer had been a director on the Roach lot , part of Harold Lloyd's crew and knew how to direct a silent comedy with a real story at its heart . With the coming of sound , Denny would be revealed not as an American , but someone with a good English accent , and he would specialize for the rest of his career in upper-class twits , in roles like ' Algie ' in the Bulldog Dummonds series . His career would extend into the 1960s , with a lovely turn in CAT BALLOU . But he is particularly good as the lead in this movie and you should not miss a chance to see it .
438713	1617546	350290	7.0	Eat Hearty !	Chaz Chase - - not to be confused with Charley Chase - - eats a variety of interesting items , including a lot of cardboard . Absolutely bizarre : this sort of act , which used to prosper in vaudeville , wound up going into the carnivals after vaudeville died . Apparently the diet agreed with Mr . Chase , since he was doing the same act thirty years later
439506	1617546	24012	8.0	Pretty Durned Good	This is an excellent early sound serial , with an wonderful cast - - including the always hissable Noah Beery Sr . as the villain , the now too frequently forgotten Tully Marshall and , of course , Johnny Mack Brown in the lead . The crew is also topnotch , including Demille cinematographer Alvin Wyckoff and some great stuntwork by Yakima Canutt , including the famous falling-under-the-stagecoach gag . Oh , and the story is pretty good , too . And that's just the first chapter of this twelve-episode serial ! To top it off , Sinister Cinema , which has just transferred this to DVD - - look them up online - - has managed to find an almost perfect print , and the beautiful camera-work is , as always , a revelation - - all too often black and white movies are preserved in muddy prints , transferred to safety stock in an offhanded fashion . Not this one ! If you enjoy western serials , hunt this one out . If you've never seen one , this is a fine introduction .
439370	1617546	28442	8.0	Delightful Hogwash	Ah , the bygone glories of the French Foreign Legion story . Almost everyone knows BEAU GESTE , from the 1939 version starring Gary Cooper . This was a lesser brother . Great actors , great direction , great cinematography and a script full of - - nowadays - - laughable bits . Claudette Colbert plays Cigarette , the Daughter of the Legion . Ronald Colman , plays the legionnaire who is trying to forget , and a young Rosalind Russell - - what a looker ! - - play Lady Venezia Cunningham with a posh accent . What can you expect from a movie in which Ronald Colman is torn between Cigarette , daughter of the Legion and Lady Venezia Cunningham with the Production Code in full force ? Well , this one . An amusing way to spend a couple of hours , if you are prepared not to take things too seriously . Or you could look at the Laurel & Hardy BEAU HUNKS .
438423	1617546	19723	8.0	Good Technique	A convicted spy manages to avoid being hanged from a bridge when the rope breaks and flees for his life and freedom in this short silent film from Charles Vidor , his first as director . Hungarian-born Vidor would go on to become a specialist in big , lush productions , including musicals like Gene Kelly's breakthrough movie , COVER GIRL and Grace Kelly's ( no relation ) final film , THE SWAN . Here , in 1929 , unhampered by bulky sound equipment , he uses only visual images , traveling shots , lots of double exposure and some unfortunately over-the-top emoting by actor Nicolas Bela to tell his titleless tale to pretty good effect . If you wish to introduce someone to dramatic silent film technique , this would not be a bad choice . It's short enough not to risk boredom and interesting enough - - life and death , after all - - to hold an audience's interest .
439165	1617546	14991	8.0	Lithuanians and Letts Do It	A fine film version of one of Elinor Glyn's silly romances . Miss Glyn founded the genre of what is today variously called the Romance Novel , the Gothic Romance or , in the trade , the Bodice-Ripper , since the heroine always winds up with a torn bodice or blouse . It happens here , too . The excellence of this version can best be understand when you hear that I saw it at the Museum of Modern Art today . The only titles were flash titles in Czech - - no one in the audience knew any of the Slavic languages . There was no script available and yet the story was perfectly intelligible and the movie was interesting , almost all due to fine direction by King Vidor and a very broad and appropriate performance by John Gilbert as a Russian nobleman . Aileen Pringle , as the object of his desire is not so good : she comes off as somewhat butch . But she is a fine actress and the overall effect is excellent . I don't know when you're going to get a chance to see this movie , but if you do , don't pass it up - - or any King Vidor film .
438801	1617546	216016	8.0	Symbols	Even when we look at one of Melies ' films and don't know what he is going on about , still , we are carried along by his speed , his good humor and his inventiveness - - after all , his films at this stage rarely last more than a minute . Here , we have a piece that might be called " The Alchemist's Dream . " The old alchemist falls asleep and dreams of finding the philosopher's stone : he dreams of snakes shedding their skins , of young women tossing gold , all the hermetical symbols of the Philosopher's Stone which not only granted the ability to transmute any item into gold , but gave one eternal youth . So this is a sad movie , in a way : an old man dreams of being young . Yet Melies hides behind these symbols , which we don't know about nowadays , and produces a fun little piece .
438984	1617546	14883	8.0	War Against Mice	An early Felix the Cat short which has most of the hallmark's of Messmer's fantastic imagination . Felix is working in a barber shop when his boss shows him an extra : the mice have declared war against the cats . Although it does not show the ' playing with light ' touch of the best Felix the Cat silents , there are plenty of good gags that made Felix the most popular cartoon series of the silent era .
439434	1617546	24334	8.0	Pre-Code Nice Girl	One of Wellman's terrific Warner's B movies - - the one before this was HEROES FOR SALES and the next would be THE WILD BOYS OF THE ROAD - - about how nice girl Loretta Young became gangster Ricardo Cortez ' moll and how an over-the-top Fanchot Tone tried to redeem her . Brilliant opening montage keeps things moving until Tone comes onstage , the picks up again . Script by Anita Loos .
439446	1617546	148009	8.0	Nether Fish Nor Fowl Nor Good Red Meat - - But Very Good Nonetheless	Frank Tashlin was one of the few cartoon directors to make a full transition to live action features - - the other best known one was Gregory LaCava - - but his cartoons were exceedingly realistic in character , gag structure and camera placement , while his live action movies were cartoonish - - think of SON OF PALEFACE or his work with Jerry Lewis . For the moment he was at Columbia whither he had been brought by offers of greater control . There he fought , made the classic THE FOX AND THE GRAPES , a few others , including this fine movie , and then went back to Warners , then onward . A fine cartoon about the problems a conductor suffers while conducting the title piece . Although all the characters are animals , the gags are beautifully done . If you're lucky enough to see this in a Technicolor print as I was , don't miss the chance .
439321	1617546	790	8.0	Early sci-fi	It is frequently and falsely claimed that Porter created the story picture in THE GREAT TRAIN ROBBERY . Melies was creating such films already , most notably in A TRIP TO THE MOON . Likewise , D . W . Griffith did not invent cross-cutting , although he did establish its usage as standard and produced what Lillian Gish called " the grammar of film . " Here is evidence that he was not working alone . This short film , based on a Verne novel , imagines the course of a future war , in which dirigibles are used to bomb cities . Although primitive by today's standards , it is clearly an epic picture and well worth the time of anyone with curiosity about the origins of film .
438636	1617546	16359	8.0	Stan finds his timing	Although he had been starring in short comedies for eight years when he made this movie , Stan Laurel had done little to make it apparent he was one of the great talents of film comedy . Some of his movies of this period are watchable only by the most dedicated of completest . Yet , in this movie , we see he had finally found his own secret to making a funny film comedy : slowing it down . Not for him the frenetic pace of the Keystone imitators , but a slower speed that let him elaborate his gags and let the audience in on the joke : we start laughing as the awful inevitability of the gag becomes apparent and still are surprised at the inventive variations on a theme . This pace is apparent in the very first shot : we see Stan , as a deerstalker-wearing detective , stewing over something at his desk . Eventually , it becomes clear that it is a blacksmith puzzle . A small boy comes in , does the puzzle , reassembles it and hands it back to Stan , who is still confounded by it . No pratfall , no sped-up motion , but a gag that fits the story , the character and Mr . Laurel . The pace continues , speeding up gradually as he is hired by future Roach Studios regular , Anita Garvin , to spy on her husband . I shan't list the gags , but they are good and this movie is an excellent harbinger of things to come .
439250	1617546	29421	8.0	Transitional Masterpiece	Iwerks directed this during his brief stay at Termite Terrace , between the collapse of his own studio and his return to Disney . Chuck Jones and Bob Clampett animated , and it's an interesting piece because it shows the hand of all three animators : Iwerks ' strong but predictable story line , Clampett's outrageous gags - - as when an outboard motor goes berserk - - and Jones ' strong sense of humor in character - - Gabby Goat , voiced by Cal Howard , is a loud grouch . Some of the gags are old and annoying - - spark plugs in the stalling car show anthropomorphic features , but with this movie , we can see the Warner Brothers style emerging . There are a few cartoons that stand at the border of styles and remain masterpieces , works like Tashlin's THE FOX AND THE GRAPES and Avery's SCREWY SQUIRREL . . . . this is another . See it .
439236	1617546	24659	8.0	When Sir John Mills was in kneepants	Bright farce played at a good speed is sure to delight those who enjoy the form . The big plus for this movie , though , is the fact that half of it takes place at a music hall , and half a dozen excellent acts fill out the film . This is an early writing credit for Frank Launder and is the movie debut of Will Hay .
439421	1617546	8022	8.0	Three for Triangle	This is an interesting and atypical short for Triangle . First , Louise Glaum , who was one of the leading vamps of the 1910s - - she usually played the bad girl in William S . Hart westerns - - stars here as the heroine , an atypical good girl role , and she is excellent at it . Second , it is an early leading role for John Gilbert , and he lights up the screen . Why did it take ten years before he became a star ? Third , the director is Reginald Barker , now sadly forgotten , but a fine story-telling director until the mid-thirties - - his best known movie was Ince's production of CIVILIZATION the previous year . and he tell his story with with interesting shots - - the intercutting between the preacher giving his Sunday sermon and the fourpiece band playing at the dance hall across the street is quick , funny and eloquent . In short , this is a fine serious movie . Take a look at it if you get the chance .
439367	1617546	37932	9.0	Wagon Wheel Joe goes it alone	A lovely little B picture with all the usual Joe Lewis touches . . . . people ripping up pillows and auras of lurking fear . Also , alas , an ending that comes out of nowhere , because , apparently , the auteur has lost interest in the movie , or perhaps because as a B picture it has to fit into a slot .
439092	1617546	16395	9.0	Better than Barbara Stanwyck !	I think Miss Stanwyck was a great actress , but when I look at the version of STELLA DALLAS that King Vidor directed her in twelve years after this silent version . . . . . well , something always bothered me about it . WHY was she supposed to be such a monster ? She was Barbara Stanwyck . All right , she wasn't dressed as beautifully as she was in THE LADY EVE , but being a little bit frumpy isn't against the law , especially when you look like Barbara Stanwyck . But when Belle Bennett dresses up in this movie , she is a well-meaning horror , wearing stripes , frills , lace , feather , rings on her fingers , probably bells on her toes . . . . . and a fat suit . You couldn't have gotten Miss Stanwyck into a fat suit . She had her eye on her career . But Belle Bennett had her eye on making this movie as good as possible , so she becomes a fat monster , loving her daughter and utterly clueless . It's a great performance . Also great is the way Henry King directs the sequences that take place in the mill town . No one had a better eye for the details of small town life than Henry King , from TOL'ABLE David through WAIT TILL THE SUN SHINES NELLIE . Jean Hersholt also has a good role as Ed Munn , and a lovely comic turn on the train into the city . Ronald Colman is fine , exuding the melancholia that he used throughout the 1930s whenever he had to run away to the Foreign Legion or face the guillotine . Alice Joyce is sedate and charming , a fine counterpoint for Bennett . Lois Moran , as Stella's daughter is adorable , and Douglas Fairbanks Jr . , in his first real role , is excellent . There are a number of plot points that must be gotten through and which are better indicated in Frances Marion's script than in the 1937 version . . . even though some points seem to be skipped over , they are butchered worse in the sound version . Something always seems to be missing from these weepers . It may be that it is simply that I am not able to appreciate the fine points of these things , but there you go . However , despite these minor failings , the above-mentioned virtues , as well as the classic final shot of Stella watching the wedding through the window , this is a great film , and it is only my annoyance at some of the minor failings of the translation from book to film that keeps me from considering this perfect . But it is ten times the film that the sound remake is . Even if the voice I hear in my head when Miss Bennett moves her lips is that of Barbara Stanwyck .
438694	1617546	50209	10.0	Someday they'll all be sorry	Here we have yet another rarely-seen and under-appreciated cartoon classic by Chuck Jones . Ralph Phillips ' three fantasies after he gets sent to his room for breaking a window are exactly the the sort of thing that any imaginative nine-year-old would think of , and the script is chock full of screwy lines like " My insurance will pay for the the window and use whatever is left over to buy yourself a catcher's mitt " and " You are being pursued by Martians who all got " A " s in Arithmetic " - - just the sort of vengeful daymares that every child who is regularly laughed at by his classmates would dream . It was so good that Jones managed one and a half sequels . Keep an eye out for this one .
438459	1617546	232902	10.0	Great Documentary & Great Music	An early and wonderful example of what tv can do when it sets itself to do something good . Stuff like this is now all over the History Channel , but you can't do better than Richard Rodger's music for this . Worth it for the score alone .
439390	1617546	37557	10.0	We're in the Money	Alan Dwan was sent out in 1911 to find a missing film crew . According to the story , the director was out on a bender and he cabled the home office " You have no director . Suggest you disband company . " Back came a telegram saying " You direct . " With this telegram he went to the crew and said " Either I'm a director or you're out of a job . " " You're the best director we ever saw ! " And direct he did for the next fifty years , sometimes shorts , sometimes prime features with Douglas Fairbanks Sr . and often in the Bs , but always doing his best . This is one of his best Bs , based on a story written by George Barr McCutcheon , which he wrote under a pen name to prove he could write a best-seller without depending on his name to sell it . It was a best seller . The stage play that this movie was based on was also a hit , and this farce , directed at top speed with a great cast . If it ever shows up anywhere you can reach it , go to see it .
439094	1617546	20140	10.0	Sprightly German Film By Russians	Ivan Mouskojine - - however you choose to transliterate his name - - was a fine movie actor . Starting out in Tsarist Russia , he fled and made a career for himself in France and Germany . One can certainly seem why . Here , playing " The King of the Swindlers " he works his way from Paris to New York with a great deal of confidence and a style of acting that was perfected during the silent era , in which you can see the emotions wash across his face - - and , playing a confidence man , he manages to impart two or three levels to his emotional range . The director of this film , Viktor Tourjansky , was another Russian √©migr√© . One would hardly expect something that has some exquisitely light moments from a German film directed by and starring Russians , but , despite the terrifying ending , when her fate catches up with bad girl Brigitte Helm , it works , running a full emotional range . I credit this , in no small part , to a dazzling , fast-moving camera helmed by Carl Hoffman . Some of the shots in the serious sections may remind you of Lang - - hardly surprising , since Hoffman had worked with Lang on such works as MABUSE .
439134	1617546	190225	10.0	You better save your confection for me	Fats Waller performs his best song and mugs for the camera with many a sky , risque comment in this 1941 soundie . A rare and impeccable record of one of the greatest showmen of jazz . If you haven't heard Waller sing this standard , you haven't heard it sung .
438699	1617546	22626	10.0	Preachy , but brilliant	Walter Huston is supposed to be the star of this movie , and he does a fine job , as always . But wait . . . . . watch for the moment when the panic on the bank begins , and in less than thirty seconds , the bank goes from almost empty to a scene of madness , the American Madness of the title . It's one of the most brilliantly choreographed and directed scenes in the entire history of the movies .
439112	1617546	150832	10.0	No ham in the sandwich	Hilarious ! Joe and his partner are desperate to break into show business - - but no one can be this desperate ! They find themselves out in the boondocks . " You open the show " " We don't open any shows . " " All right , you close the show . " " I think we are the show ! " With Billy Gilbert as the dyspeptic stage manager , it's a good thing the only audience is the janitor .
