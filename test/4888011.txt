365164	4888011	260571	1.0	Why study them ? So that Mike , Servo and Crow can make fun of them !	How in the name of anything holy can " Why Study Industrial Arts ? " claim to be an educational film ? ! If this is education , then I'd rather be an idiot ! Actually , this movie could have only been created by an idiot . The only reason that it's even worth talking about is because " MST3K " once showed this drudgery . As you might imagine , Mike , Servo and Crow had plenty of funny comments . If I ever make an educational film , it will be a promotion of vegetarianism . Here's the plot : in 1950s suburban America , mom and dad are trying to feed little Jimmy meat . Jimmy breaks out into a song ( to the tune of " U Can't Touch This " ) about why he chooses to be a vegetarian . Yeah , that's my kind of educational film .
365112	4888011	279772	1.0	A rebuttal to " Roger and Me " . . .	. . . was how Crow defined " Design for Dreaming " when he , Servo and Mike had to watch it . It portrays a happy-go-lucky woman living a fantasy in which a jolly man buys her any car that she wants , and a kitchen has all the appliances that a 1950s housewife could ask for . Very much a product of the 1950s . A previous reviewer called this short " I Dream of Jeannie " on LSD . I thought that it looked like the Broadway sequence in " Singin ' in the Rain " on LSD . But either way , the movie is beyond pathetic , just the sort of schlock that Dr . Forrester would cruelly beam aboard the Satellite of Love to torture Mike , Servo and Crow . In conclusion , the movie itself is , but the " MST3K " is .
365125	4888011	155711	2.0	all flaws with practically no redeeming qualities	You know how comedies are supposed to make you laugh ? Well , " Flawless " makes you laugh , but you're not laughing at what happens in the movie ; you're laughing at the fact that the movie didn't come out very good . Certainly the idea of a homophobic cop having to make amends with a drag queen seems like it could make an interesting movie , but they didn't do it here . The whole thing just drags . The movie doesn't even really have any clever lines . Robert DeNiro should have known better than to star in this , and I think that we can all agree that Philip Seymour Hoffman did a much better job playing a gay person in " Capote " . All in all , pathetic .
365250	4888011	174917	2.0	Back when Ernest Borgnine won an Oscar for " Marty " , who would have ever thought that one of his movies would be " MST3K " - worthy ?	" Merlin's Shop of Mystical Wonders " is too dark to be a children's movie and too cute to be a horror flick . Which makes it perfect " Mystery Science Theater 3000 " fodder ! An incompetent mixture of " Poltergeist " and any wizard movie , it makes one wonder how they got a great actor like Ernest Borgnine on board . Although the movie has 1996 as its date , a large portion of it looks as though it was filmed at least ten years earlier ( a very corny ' 80s look ) . As for the " MST3K " version , jokes naturally abound . I don't remember which jeers came from Mike , Servo or Crow , but someone notes that Merlin probably shouldn't ask women if they've seen his monkey ! And when the ground starts caving in , one of them declares that Bugs Bunny must have missed that left turn at Albuquerque ! Among the famous people who get mentioned are Tom Bosley , Madeline Albright , Bella Abzug and Linda Blair . So just stick with the " MST3K " version and you'll be fine . Yeah , she did look kinda like Julie Hagerty .
363084	4888011	114148	2.0	" Johnny Smith and Poker-Huntas " was the only interesting portrayal that I've seen	It was one thing for Disney to make animated features of self-proclaimed fictional stories ( " Cinderella " , " Aladdin " , etc . ) . But it's going too far to make a fantasy story and try to pass it off as history . That's just what they do with " Pocahontas " . While they prided themselves on treating Indians more respectfully , the Indians come across as noble savages ( meaning how white people prefer to view them , even if it is a positive portrayal ) . The images are very modern : Pocahontas is a princess with giant breasts and a skinny waist ( a Barbie doll , if you will ) , while John Smith is a hunky dude . Around the time that the movie came out , I participated in a review of it on a local radio station . Having recently studied the history of Jamestown , I could see that the movie got little if anything right , and so I challenged almost everything that the other reviewers said . The fact is that Disney - a corporation with kiddie entertainment as its main purpose - is not ready to tell the real story of what happened , and may never be ready to . As I understand it , when the English people first saw Pocahontas , she was naked and bald . The English , meanwhile , lacked any hygiene . All in all , if you want a realistic portrayal of the events surrounding the Jamestown settlement , this is the last version that you'll want to watch . But Terrence Malick's " The New World " isn't much better , lasting way too long and plodding the whole way through . The best version that I've seen is unfortunately one of the more racist ones : the Merrie Melodies 1938 cartoon " Johnny Smith and Poker-Huntas " , starring Elmer Fudd's prototype Egghead as John Smith . As this cartoon was directed by Tex Avery , it was naturally chock-full of sight gags , the sort of stuff that one would expect to find in a Marx Brothers movie or a Leslie Nielsen movie . While it did contain the average stereotypical portrayals of Indians , it was one of the cleverest cartoons that I've seen . Now , I understand that some people might assert that " Pocahontas " doesn't have to be totally realistic . Maybe so , but the problem is that it claims to be based on historical events . I , for one , do not consider a fantasy pretending to be history very appropriate . In summer , 1995 , Mel Gibson starred in - and directed - another less than totally accurate historical movie : " Braveheart " ; well , that one was much more accurate than this one . Just avoid this one , OK ? John Smith eventually had to return to England after getting injured in a gunpowder explosion . Without him , the rest of the colonists decided that they no longer had to do any work . Come winter , the settlement totally collapsed
363501	4888011	120654	2.0	How low can one go ?	Another example of how Chevy Chase suffered after his TV show failed , this one has some losers opening a revenge-for-hire business . I think that there's a reason that Norm MacDonald and Artie Lange have no reputation in movies . If " Dirty Work " was the best that they could do , then they deserve no reputation . The only excuse that great actors like Jack Warden and Don Rickles could have for appearing in this swill would be needing money . All in all , there's no real excuse for this movie even existing . I can't think of anything good to say about it . I'm surprised that it didn't go straight to video . I still can't quite figure out why it is that Chevy Chase , one of Bill Clinton's best friends in entertainment , spent practically all of Clinton's presidency with his career in the toilet .
365657	4888011	41671	2.0	Franz Liszt must be spinning in his grave ( and we need to talk some about escapism )	My mom often tells me about how , growing up in Galena Park , Texas , the local cinema was the hot place . Among her favorite flicks there were Vincent Price's stuff ( deliberate camp ) ; among her least favorite flicks were Doris Day's stuff ( the wholesome girl next door ) . Watching " My Dream Is Yours " , I can see why she had no respect for these sorts of movies . This one is an infantilizing story of a cute-and-nothing-else woman getting her break into show biz . I only knew about the movie because one of the Looney Tunes DVDs showed a scene from it in which Bugs Bunny , Doris Day and Jack Carson tell a boy to wake up to the tune of Franz Liszt's " Second Hungarian Rhapsody " . The truth is , Liszt must be spinning in his grave knowing how they misused his song here . And the people behind the Looney Tunes cartoons should have known better than to let their greatest creation get used in this swill . But as it is , the Bugs Bunny scene is really the only scene worth watching ; in fact , if you watch only that scene , you just might come away with a good impression of the movie . As for me , I watched the movie only to heckle it like Mike , Servo and Crow do to the crummy movies sent them by Dr . Forrester on " Mystery Science Theater 3000 " ( the truth is , " MST3K " would have a field day with " MDIY " ) . Among my jeers were : ( as Jack Carson picks up a phone ) : " Do you have Prince Albert in a can ? " ( as Jack Carson and Doris Day are about to board the plane ) : " Hey , I bet Mohammed Atta is one of your fellow passengers ! " " My dream is yours . . . " " Yeah ? Well , my nightmare is this movie ! " OK , so I think that I've done as much as I can to describe how stupid this movie was , so I'll now look at it from another angle . I watched this hunk o'junk a few hours after I went to see " Grindhouse " . The only similarity between the two movies is that they're both escapism . But the Robert Rodriguez-Quentin Tarantino double feature was blatantly absurd , and quite proud of being as gross as possible ; it comes out very honorable as a result . This one , on the other hand , believes itself to be as much a masterpiece as " Citizen Kane " . I would just like to say that this movie reaches that one's quality about to the extent that " Ishtar " does . In fact , it makes you feel like you're turning into one of the zombies from " Grindhouse " . In fact , while Doris Day's character was supposed to be cute , I just prefer to believe that she was uglier than any of those zombies . In conclusion , unless you're one of those people who thinks that any hokey movie turns into a masterpiece just because a bunch of people start singing , you'll definitely want to avoid this movie . In fact , one thing that you could do is rent the movie but go straight to the special features and watch the Looney Tunes cartoon " A Ham in a Role " , in which the Goofy Gophers torment a Shakespearean actor . Stick with that one and avoid " My Dream Is Yours " ( except maybe the Bugs Bunny scene ) . In case you've forgotten , Mohammed Atta was one of the hijackers . If you consider it illogical to mention him and " Grindhouse " while reviewing this movie . . . well , I consider this movie as much a piece of crap as any of the hijackers , and I think that I speak for at least most of my generation when I say that we far prefer gross-out exploitation movies to anything starring Doris Day .
365698	4888011	78767	3.0	most of us will probably agree that " The Shining " significantly improved on the idea	Family moves into house , strange things start happening . Yeah , we've seen that story about a million times now , so " The Amityville Horror " unfortunately has little to offer us . Although they self-righteously declare that the movie is based on a true story , the real story couldn't have been like what the movie portrays . The movie is essentially two hours of people shouting scared comments , and it uses special effects where they could have character development . Most people will probably agree that " The Shining " significantly improved on this idea . I wouldn't be surprised if James Brolin , Margot Kidder and Rod Steiger chose not to emphasize this movie when discussing their careers . No , it's not a terrible movie . The whole thing just seems trashy .
362831	4888011	94794	3.0	O Canada . . .	Another horror flick in which a goof-ball teenager battles a madman and his supernatural sidekick who want to take over ? ! Yes , but the fact that this one was from Canada gives it a slightly different feel . " The Brain " has troublesome teenager Jim Majelewski getting put into a treatment whose leader turns out to be a cult leader aided by a big ugly " brain " . Can Jim stop him ? I guess that since our northern neighbor has accomplished all that they have accomplished , they're entitled to make at least one ridiculous horror movie . But still , they'll probably want to be known for having national health care and all . The bad guy had a brain . Why didn't the people who made this movie ?
362958	4888011	119874	3.0	Now that George Clooney has won an Oscar , it's amazing that he once starred in this garbage .	You know how George Clooney is one of the most well regarded actors in Hollywood ? You know , that he just recently won an Oscar for " Syriana " and received a Best Director nomination for " Good Night , and Good Luck . " ? And he went on a fact-finding mission to Darfur ? Well , nine years ago , all this would have seemed unfathomable . In 1997 , Clooney starred in two of the most pathetic movies imaginable . Everyone knows how bad " Batman and Robin " was , but probably not as many people know about " The Peacemaker " . This one casts him as a man out to stop a terrorist from using a loose nuke from Russia . Yes , they could make such a plot into something interesting , but they didn't . Nicole Kidman's character is the ultimate cliché : she's beautiful and smart , and totally melts in Clooney's presence . It's almost incredible that director Mimi Leder also directed the very good " Deep Impact " . Look , just avoid this worthless movie . George Clooney and Nicole Kidman have both starred in plenty of good movies , so there's no reason to waste your time on this .
365787	4888011	52618	5.0	Do we remember anything except the chariot race ?	Everyone remembers the blades on the bad guy's chariot , and how he whips the title character ( Charlton Heston ) . But overall , " Ben-Hur " is basically a soap opera ( well , how could a biblical epic not be ? ) . And of course , there's a few things nowadays that change how we view the movie . Given how Charlton Heston's character wants revenge , wouldn't it make more sense for him to just get a gun ? I mean , we're talking about the NRA president here ! Also , there's that one character who it turns out was supposed to be gay ( Heston thought that they were just friends ) . All in all , considering that 1959 produced movies like " Some Like It Hot " , " The 400 Blows " and " Anatomy of a Murder " , was this really the one to give Best Picture ? Not in my opinion . It's a classic mainly because of the chariot race . I remember a comic strip where Hollywood decides to do dumb remakes of classic epics , resulting in " Gone with the Wit " and " Ben-Huh ? " . Also , Roberto Benigni said in an interview that this was the first movie that he ever saw in the theater , but his family didn't have enough money for a ticket , so they watched it from behind the screen . So , the first movie that he ever saw in the theaters was " Ruh-Neb " !
363096	4888011	59742	5.0	Homer : " D'oh ! " Marge : " A deer ! " Lisa : " A female deer ! " ( note : this will probably be the only review of this movie ever written that mentions Ben & Jerry's Ice Crea	Wholesome woman leaves Austrian convent and goes to be governess for a captain's children right before the Nazis take over Austria . Go figure ! As it was , I spent most of " The Sound of Music " throwing out the sort of comments that Mike , Servo and Crow hurl at the grade-Z movies that Dr . Forrester sends them on " Mystery Science Theater 3000 " . Seeing Christopher Plummer - who apparently called the movie " The Sound of Mucus " - I thought to myself : " So that's the guy from ' The Return of the Pink Panther ' , ' Dragnet ' , ' Dolores Claiborne ' , ' The Insider ' and ' Syriana ' ? " As for Julie Andrews , she basically reprises her " Mary Poppins " role . And considering that it was Austria , we now probably will think that someone could have just gotten Arnold Schwarzenegger to come in and kick Nazi booty . For the record , one of the " Simpsons " comic books had Sideshow Bob and his brother Cecil spoofing famous musicals ( including this one ) with songs about killing Bart Simpson . And I read that after the Von Trapps fled Europe , they eventually settled in Vermont . I wonder , could Maria have gotten to know Ben & Jerry ? Anyway , " TSOM " isn't terrible ; it just seems so hokey in the 21st century . I personally prefer to remember Robert Wise ( RIP ) for " West Side Story " .
365330	4888011	365686	5.0	Moonlight Sonata's ego game	Prior to " Revolver " , Guy Ritchie had directed two really great movies ( " Lock , Stock . . . " and " Snatch " ) and one ultra-crummy one ( I never saw his " Swept Away " remake , but everything that I heard about it said that it sucked ) . Now , his latest one is somewhat confusing . Portraying a man ( Jason Statham ) getting out of jail and involving himself in the deadly world of gambling , I remained befuddled as to what the overall point was . True , the quotes are always likely to provide some help in life . Otherwise , it seems as if he shows this stuff only because he can . Not a bad movie , but I couldn't tell that it really went anywhere . I wouldn't mind it if Ritchie made a movie about his childhood and his memories of what happened in the world during it . Also starring Ray Liotta and Vincent Pastore .
363981	4888011	24756	5.0	early instance of inanimate objects coming to life	There were a few instances during the 1930-35 Warner Bros . cartoons when inanimate objects came to life , but the Termite Terrace perfected the genre in the late ' 30s . " We're in the Money " has a gaggle of toys dancing to the title song in a department store . Frank Tashlin's cartoons " Speaking of the Weather " ( about magazines ) , " Have You Got Any Castles ? " ( about books ) and " You're an Education " ( about travel brochures ) were the first really clever cartoons in which azoic things animate themselves . Later there was Bob Clampett's " Goofy Groceries " ( about various objects in a supermarket ) , and finally , the crowning achievement , Clampett's " Book Revue " ( books again ) . I saw the latter several times when I was a little boy and naively laughed at it , but didn't really understand it until I saw it when I was twenty-two . Anyway , this one is good as a historical reference .
363982	4888011	95016	5.0	total kick-ass movie	One of the original action flicks from the ' 80s , John McTiernan's " Die Hard " makes no pretense about being a kick-ass movie . Bruce Willis plays a New York cop John McClane , coming to LA to meet his estranged wife ( Bonnie Bedelia ) . Sure enough , the building in which she works get hijacked by a group of German terrorists . Terrorist leader Hans Gruber ( Alan Rickman in his debut ) , while totally evil , is also quite cultured . Even though the cards look stacked against John McClane , he's ready to take on every one of these terrorists . Twenty years after its release , this movie will probably only appeal to Willis's fans . While mostly a litany of machismo , there are some cringe-inducing scenes ( namely when John has to walk across glass ) . But the movie's main focus is to show Bruce Willis being a tough guy . They do everything possible to make him a superhuman individual to whom we can still relate . All in all , this is a flick that you'll want to avoid if you're into intellectualism . But you'll love it if you're a testosterone-driven dude . I think that I'm content having seen it only once . Also starring Alexander Godunov ( one of the Amish farmers in " Witness " ) , Paul Gleason ( the principal in " The Breakfast Club " ) and William Atherton ( the EPA agent in " Ghostbusters " ) . I wouldn't mind getting to ride off into the sunset with Grace Kelly .
365740	4888011	51786	5.0	ordinary	I could say that " It ! The Terror from Beyond Space " is your typical 1950s B-movie , but it's not . It was the inspiration for " Alien " almost twenty years later ( naturally , the latter was more polished ) . But otherwise , the former has everything that one would expect in such a movie : political incorrectness and continuity errors . Don't get me wrong ; it's by no means a bad movie ( although " MST3K " could show it ) . I guess that one thing that I found interesting is that one of the cast members is Dabbs Greer , who played Tom Hanks ' older self in " The Green Mile " . When you think about it , if you combine all the titles of 1950s and early 60s B-movies , it would probably come out as something like " The Dead Blood from Outer Space that Married a Teenager " . Well . . .
363640	4888011	120338	5.0	In Spanish class , I wrote a story portraying the famous movies of 1997 aboard the Titanic while it was sinking .	Okay , everyone knows what happens in " Titanic " , so I'll discuss a few other points . While the movie was in the theaters , one of my friends went to see it 13 times , just so that he could find goofs ; the one that he picked up on was when someone opens a door , turns his head , and you see that it's the wrong color . When I took a sailing class in summer , 2005 , the teacher explained why specifically the Titanic sank : it was traveling way too fast for something that size ( so they couldn't turn in time ) , and the metal on the ship's sides was rather shoddy ; that is to say , they endangered everyone's lives so as to save money for themselves ( well , that's one of many times when those at the top have put profits ahead of safety ) . And I have a question : considering how many people died on the Titanic , was it appropriate to use this event to further Leonardo DiCaprio's career ? As for that story that I wrote , it portrayed Kevin Kline and Tom Selleck ( from " In & Out " ) believing themselves to resemble Leo and Kate ; Al Pacino ( from " Donnie Brasco ) realizing that he was going to sleep with the fishes ; Jim Carrey ( from " Liar Liar " ) admitting : " I can't lie : I wasn't watching for icebergs while I was steering ! " ; Kim Basinger ( from " LA Confidential " ) wondering whether or not she would look like Veronica Lake at the bottom of the ocean ; and Jack Nicholson ( from " As Good as It Gets " ) still inside his cabin and saying " Don't knock on my door ! Even if the ship is sinking , don't knock on my door ! " . Oh , I forgot to say my opinion of the movie . When everyone at school asked me what I thought , I always said " Well , I . . . " That's what I'm going to say here . I consider " Titanic " right down the middle . I think that " In & Out " was the best movie of 1997 . End of story .
364852	4888011	120716	5.0	no comparisons with " Life is Beautiful " , please	First , I want to say that Robin Williams is one of my favorite actors , and one of the funniest people alive today . Which makes it all the more disappointing that he doesn't get to do anything in " Jakob the Liar " . A lot of people compared this movie to " Life is Beautiful " ; if anything , it just ripped that one off . This story of a Jewish man in Nazi-occupied Poland trying to give everyone hope just can't create a believable presence . It's not terrible , just nothing creative . And I'm probably not the only person who thinks that Williams's career hit an all time low in 1999 , as he starred in this and the apparently dreadful " Bicentennial Man " . Fortunately , he's made a comeback since then ( I expect a cool performance from him in " Night at the Museum " ) . Also starring Alan Arkin , Bob Balaban , Michael Jeter , Armin Mueller-Stahl and Liev Schreiber ; they probably and Williams want to downplay this movie when describing their careers .
363130	4888011	33324	5.0	racist yes ( but still worth seeing )	Obviously , it's hard to laugh at " All This and Rabbit Stew " nowadays , given the blatantly racist caricature . The cartoon features Bugs Bunny teasing an African-American hunter . I have to admit that some scenes are quite funny - that whole sequence with the bullets was a real hoot - but how can we judge the rest ? As long as we understand what the cartoon portrays , it's possible to . . . well , I don't know whether I can say enjoy it . As the cartoon is almost certain to offend African-Americans , I don't know what more I can say . I do recommend seeing it just to understand stereotypical characterizations .
364173	4888011	52646	6.0	Was the monster that guy in the Diane Arbus photo ?	We might call " The Brain That Wouldn't Die " a B-movie , but it actually wasn't too bad . Granted , the concept was pretty outlandish , but the movie is worth seeing ( if only for sci-fi fetishists ) . The plot of course has Dr . Bill Cortner ( Herb Evers ) keeping lover Jan Compton's ( Virginia Leith ) decapitated head alive . The head befriends a monster ( Eddie Carmel ) in the closet . Sound far-fetched ? It is , but the movie's pretty cool . And I remember that Diane Arbus titled one of her photos " Jewish Giant Visiting His Parents in Brooklyn " , and I think that it was Eddie Carmel in that photo . The things that we see in life . . .
364602	4888011	70126	6.0	How far can one go in ripping off Kubrick ?	When I picked up " Una gota de sangre para morir amando " ( called " Murder in a Blue World " in English ) , I think that the box loosely said something about it being a Spanish " Clockwork Orange " . It turns out that the movie is a total rip-off of " A Clockwork Orange " ( to the point where they even mention " ACO " in a scene right before a motorcycle gang attacks ) . The main plot has young nurse Sue Lyon luring men to their dooms . . . just for the hell of it , apparently . What makes this world so blue ? ! Aside from the plot , the other Kubrick connection is " Lolita " . There's of course the ex-nymphet Sue Lyon , but one scene even shows a person holding Vladimir Nabokov's novel ! For the most part , it wouldn't be fair to compare this movie to any of Kubrick's movies . It's an OK way to pass time . The only real downside is that Sue Lyon doesn't do any full frontal nude scenes ( in this sort of movie , she should have ) . Also starring Chris Mitchum ( Robert's son ) .
364311	4888011	43265	6.0	a queen of a movie	Okay , so I admit that " The African Queen " is pure escapism , but you gotta love it . Katharine Hepburn plays Rose Sayer , a prim and proper missionary in German East Africa with her brother ( Robert Morley ) in 1914 . Suddenly , right after they receive news that war has broken out in Europe , the German army comes in and demolishes their settlement . After the brother dies , hard-drinking stubbly sailor Charlie Allnut ( Humphrey Bogart ) comes in and agrees to take Rose down the river . Along the way , they bicker about various things ( she's disgusted by his drinking , he finds her too pious ) , but they grow to respect each other . Bogart and Hepburn pretty much play their usual roles , and the movie also stars a few crocodiles ( most of the movie was filmed on location in Africa ) . The portrayal of the German army certainly seems to be an allusion to the Nazis . But overall , the movie is quite admirable , with Rose's and Charlie's personalities bouncing off of each other . It's like an early buddy comedy , even though it's serious .
364614	4888011	52847	6.0	time capsules forever	On the one hand , " Gidget " looks like an intelligence-challenged flick , as the cute teenage girl goes to the beach to possibly meet boys . But I think that there's more to it than just that . As far as I could tell , the movie also looked at her burgeoning sexuality and her uncertainty thereof . Plus , the girls wear pants ; wouldn't that have looked a little tomboyish in the ' 50s ? What I'm saying is that people need to watch this movie again . While it remains a 1950s time capsule , I got the sense that something - I don't know what exactly - hinted at the changes coming over the next decade . In case anybody chooses to call this movie stupid , I totally reject that . " Stupid " is the description that I would apply to Eddie Murphy's movies from the past few years , or any Steven Seagal movie . As for Sandra Dee herself , from what I've read about her it sounds as though she was a pretty intelligent person , having far more substance than her movie roles implied . Anyway , I recommend this movie . Also starring James Darren and Cliff Robertson . That means that Cliff Robertson is the only actor who has worked with Sandra Dee and Tobey Maguire ( in " Spiderman " ) .
365134	4888011	60244	6.0	suddenly , RR gets kind of mean and senses danger	In the mid to late ' 60s , Warner Bros . animation was slowly but surely coming to a close . " Clippety Clobbered " is a prime example , as Wile E . Coyote receives in the mail a non-Acme product to help him catch Road Runner . Naturally , this one fails , as do his subsequent attempts . However , I notice something different about this cartoon . Whereas in most of the WEC-RR pairings , RR usually doesn't even seem to notice that WEC exists , here he does . In fact , RR plays some rather cruel tricks on WEC , and even runs away at the sight of WEC ( does he finally realize the potential danger ? ) . So , it's an OK cartoon , but the formula was pretty much spent by this point , so nothing looks particularly new .
364626	4888011	60053	6.0	I think I'm a clone now	When I was really young , part of what I always liked about the classic Looney Tunes cartoons was the beginning , when the Warner Bros . shield would zoom towards the audience through the concentric circles . For some reason , later on they made up a less creative intro , like the one seen in " A-Haunting We Will Go " . Oh well . I guess that it's not really fair to criticize the intro . I read that this cartoon was basically a clone of an earlier one with Bugs Bunny . This one has Daffy Duck's nephew scared of Witch Hazel , and so Daffy tries to prove that there's no such thing as witches . Meanwhile , Hazel turns Speedy Gonzalez into a witch , and Daffy meets him in that form . I could tell that some scenes were lifted out of " Duck Amuck " , so that weakened the cartoon somewhat . But otherwise , it's still good for a few laughs . Not bad , but not the best .
362922	4888011	95107	6.0	Keep it going when possible .	There was never anything particularly special about the Ernest movies : mostly they were excuses to have a series of nonsensical gags . But still , they were fun to watch . And believe you me , this one sure is . " Ernest Saves Christmas " has lovable hick Ernest P . Worrell ( Jim Varney ) trying to help Santa Claus find a new person to deliver toys . Yep , you read that right . Like I said , most of the movie is a bunch of silly gags ( particularly when Ernest is in Santa's sleigh ) , but they do it with heart . If it's sappy at times , the really funny parts make up for that ( you'll recognize them when you see the movie ) . Knowwhaddamean ?
365760	4888011	59800	6.0	Here they were starting to get gimmicky .	After " Dr . No " , " From Russia with Love " and " Goldfinger " were more oriented towards their plots , " Thunderball " was more gimmicky and focused more on gadgetry . That's not to say that it wasn't enjoyable . Here , SPECTRE steals some nukes , and James Bond ( Sean Connery ) has to stop them . Of course , part of the plot is that Bond is surrounded by hot babes - many of whom he beds . Still , one gets the feeling that at this point , Sean Connery may have been feeling disenchanted with the role ( he did in fact quit the role after a few more movies ) . Personally , I think that they should have stopped making the movies after he left ; none of the other actors have equalled his quality .
362894	4888011	59125	6.0	So that's Donald Sutherland . . .	Hammer Films just kept ' em coming in the ' 50s and ' 60s . If Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing were involved , then you could safely assume that they had something neat in store . In " Dr . Terror's House of Horrors " , enigmatic Dr . Sandor Schreck ( Peter Cushing ) is in a train with five other men . He proceeds to tell them their fortunes . There's nothing particularly scary here , but it's never pretentious either . This movie is what most of these movies were : nice , silly fun . A standout in the movie is a very young Donald Sutherland as one of the men ; I guess that it's sort of a before-they-were-famous situation for him . And finally , there's a delicious surprise at the end .
364102	4888011	32909	6.0	even less-than-masterpiece cartoons focus on certain topics better than most movies do	From the time of Porky Pig's debut until about the time that we entered WWII , Warner Bros . mostly cast him roles that they figured represented every aspect of life . One of these was the captain of the Mayflower . Bob Clampett's " Pilgrim Porky " is basically a series of spot gags , the sort of stuff that one would expect in a Tex Avery cartoon ( except that Avery's stuff was cleverer ) . Also , there are some racial stereotypes . To this cartoon's credit , I like it's portrayal of the Mayflower and everything relating thereto better than the story that we've usually been taught . I find it cool to see a mangling of our national myth . Both " The Addams Family Values " and " The Ice Storm " talked about the true significance of the first Thanksgiving . Overall , this one's OK for some brief entertainment . I should admit that some of the gags made me laugh . Clampett directed better stuff over the next few years .
363406	4888011	58886	6.0	she wouldn't have noticed if he'd smelled bad	It's no surprise that for the role of one of history's most famous painters they cast the guy who played Moses and Ben-Hur ( who ever would have guessed that he would later be the NRA's president ? ) . Of course , Carol Reed's " The Agony and the Ecstasy " is basically a dramatization of Pope Julius II ( Rex Harrison ) hiring Michelangelo ( Charlton Heston , who turns 83 today ) to paint the Sistine Chapel , and does get just a overdone at times . Granted , I like focuses on historical events , and the movie does a good job with its subject . We see Michelangelo's inner conflicts while Julius keeps trying to get him to finish quicker . So , I recommend it as a look at this one part of history . Just understand that there is a slight soap opera feeling . And for the record , I don't think that Contessa de Medici ( Diane Cilento , who was Sean Connery's wife at the time ) would have noticed if Michelangelo had stunk , as most people in Europe didn't usually bathe back then .
363464	4888011	44001	7.0	this place is a zoo	Once again , Pepe Le Pew tries to get slinky with the female cat , but his offensive odor prevents it . In this case , he lives in Paris zoo - where everything begins with " le " - and she paints herself like a skunk to get something to eat . In some senses , it seems like if you've seen one Pepe Le Pew cartoon , you've seen ( and possibly smelled ) them all . But " Scent-imental Romeo " is still really fun . I've long viewed Pepe as the sort of misunderstood person who can't help that he's offensive , because he doesn't know it ( and isn't it our stereotype that the French lack hygiene skills ? ) . But anyway , this cartoon is still a treat . Watching it , you may feel like getting romantic with someone .
362899	4888011	26532	7.0	Porky's voice comes from a dog	While the early Warner Bros . cartoon " Into Your Dance " ( directed by Friz Freleng ) does feature a scene of black-face characters , the rest is pretty entertaining . It portrays a sort of talent show aboard a stern-wheeler , but every performer screws up somehow . Is that doomed to happen every time ? ! One thing that I noticed is that the conductor is a pig looking very much like Porky , but I didn't detect that he says anything . Towards the end , a dog has Porky's stutter . What gives ? Then again , maybe I too easily get hung up on the wrong sorts of things . This cartoon is a worthy look into the beginning of the group that would soon create Bugs , Daffy , etc .
365076	4888011	52298	7.0	Carl Stalling departs	" To Itch His Own " is not like anything that I've ever seen . For the first few minutes , it's sort of unclear what's happening , as Angelo the world's strongest flea decides to take a vacation from the circus ( I guess that he " fleas " the circus ) . But once he settles in on a certain dog and another dog invades the scene , it all takes off . Was this cartoon a masterpiece ? I wouldn't go so far as to say that . But pretty much anything that Chuck Jones created was quite fascinating . This cartoon contains no dialog , unless of course you count yelps of pain . Worth seeing , and a worthy final effort for composer Carl Stalling , who retired after this one . I wonder why strongmen always have to have names ending in O .
364064	4888011	26422	7.0	genetic mutations get so weird that a pig fathers a cat	Porky Pig's second appearance ( and Tex Avery's directorial debut ) does feature a few racial stereotypes , but overall , " Gold Diggers of ' 49 " made me laugh . Set at the time of the 1849 California gold rush , Porky and Beans are prospectors , and Beans wants to marry Porky's daughter Kitty ( the three characters got introduced in " I Haven't Got a Hat " earlier in 1935 , and Porky looks as if he needs triple bypass surgery ) . Part of this involves Beans guarding a little something of Porky's . If you've seen any of Tex Avery's cartoons , then you should know what sorts of things to expect here . The gags aren't quite as zany as I might have hoped for , but I try to imagine how hilarious they must have looked the first time that moviegoers ever saw them . If absolutely nothing else , this should be of interest to cartoon fans as a look into the Termite Terrace crowd's early days . Worth seeing . As for the question of how a pig fathered a cat . . . well , in cartoons things don't have to make sense .
365452	4888011	405336	7.0	seemingly couldn't be , but is	Having seen Richard Kelly's work so far ( " Donnie Darko " and " Southland Tales " ) , I'm very eager to see what his third salvo will be . If you just hear a little bit about this movie , it would probably sound like something that either couldn't exist as a movie , or would have to be something starring Leslie Nielsen . It would likely be hard to envision The Rock ( billed with his real name Dwayne Johnson ) , Sarah Michelle Gellar and Seann William Scott co-starring in a movie set in a future in which the War on Terrorism has officially become World War III , and every part of everyone's lives in monitored in a way that puts Orwell to shame . But yes , this movie is just that , and even more . There are a couple of things to interpret ( at least as I interpreted them ) . Boxer Santaros ( Johnson ) is a movie star who married into a politician's family ( possibly a reference to Arnold Schwarzenegger ? ) . Krysta Now ( Gellar ) is a former porn star who has her own reality show , on which she pontificates about current issues ; ah yes , wouldn't every news show just love to have movie stars on as commentators , whether or not they know a damn thing about the topic ? Anyway , the setting is that there was a nuclear attack on the United States on Independence Day 2005 , and so the government used that as an excuse to turn the country into an ultra-police state ( while invading every " enemy country " except Cuba ) . Ronald Taverner ( Scott ) is an agent of UPU , the secret police ; he also has a twin brother Roland , who is a member of a neo-Marxist group . Meanwhile , German company Treer has invented a device to use the ocean currents as energy . . . with unexpected results . As the third anniversary of the attack approaches , Los Angeles gears up for the release of a zeppelin into the sky while the authorities battle the neo-Marxist group . But all is not what it seems . . . At times , there's so much going on that the movie is a little hard to follow , especially in the scenes with the multiple TV screens . But in the grand scheme of things , I recommend this movie . As I said earlier , I would have never imagined The Rock , Sarah Michelle Gellar and Seann William Scott co-starring in a movie dealing with things like the PATRIOT Act , but they all did a good job . I wouldn't be surprised if some of the events depicted here come true . And like I said , I'm eager to see Richard Kelly's next movie . Also starring Justin Timberlake , Wallace Shawn , Beth Grant , Miranda Richardson , Mandy Moore , Kevin Smith , John Larroquette , Jon Lovitz , Rebekah Del Rio , Nora Dunn , Bai Ling , Cheri Oteri , Amy Poehler , Lou Taylor Pucci , Janeane Garofalo , Christopher Lambert , Zelda Rubinstein and Will Sasso .
364308	4888011	34881	7.0	let's all be witches	Anyone watching " I Married a Witch " would probably want to start engaging in a little witchcraft . Veronica Lake is great as witch Jennifer , who with her father ( Cecil Kellaway ) was burned alive 270 years ago . But now they've both been freed - by lightning striking the tree that imprisoned them - and want to get revenge on the descendant of their executioner . It turns out , this descendant ( Frederic March ) is running for governor . As we movie watchers should all know , political campaigns make for some great humor on the silver screen . As an example of how great the humor here is likely to end up , this guy is about to get married ! Everything ends up in a zany whirlwind . This movie deserves more recognition that it has gotten . I would say that it has done almost as much to advance the cause of witchcraft as " Bewitched " ( which also featured a really hot witch ) and the Looney Tunes cartoons starring Witch Hazel . In short , this movie definitely has me in its spell .
365255	4888011	236784	7.0	The spy who came in from the heat .	I wasn't totally familiar with John Le Carre's work when I saw " The Tailor of Panama " . But whether or not you're familiar with his work , you're still likely to get impressed by the movie . If it looks strange that Pierce Brosnan plays a non-James Bond spy , don't let that turn you off ; as it is , I like this spy better than his role as James Bond . The plot has British agent Andrew Osnard ( Brosnan ) getting involved with impeccably dressed tailor Harry Pendel ( Geoffrey Rush ) in Panama City . Both men have self-serving sides , but Osnard clearly has some unctuous plans up his sleeve , and will likely stop at nothing to get the job done . The potentially explosive political climate surrounding them serves to heighten the tension . I certainly thought that Brosnan and Rush both did a really good job with their roles . Jamie Lee Curtis is actually , in my opinion , a strange person to cast in a spy movie - I've always found it a little bit hard to view her in a tense role - though I do feel that she did a good job with the role . And playing the son is none other than Harry Potter himself , Daniel Radcliffe . So , while it may not be the most eye-opening spy movie ever , it creates a fairly unnerving feeling . After watching it , you may be tempted to go to Panama . . . just to see whether or not this sort of thing actually happens ( although you probably wouldn't want to experience it ) . Worth seeing .
365337	4888011	810988	7.0	playing nine pins	I'd never heard of " The Nines " when I started watching it . Now , I'm not sure what to think of it . Portraying three interconnected stories set in Los Angeles - and all starring the same people - it seems to be saying something about happenstance . . . but I don't know for certain . I can't say what the overall gist is supposed to be . But I do think that the movie is worth checking out . Seeing what happens in the middle segment , one gets a sense of just how cutthroat the entertainment world must be ( is it just me , or does nobody focus on that more than the entertainment world ? ) . Anyway , worth seeing , but don't be surprised if it totally blows your mind . Starring Ryan Reynolds , Melissa McCarthy , Hope Davis and Elle Fanning .
363022	4888011	95927	7.0	Happy 60th , Sally !	A few years before Sally Field and Tom Hanks played mother and son in " Forrest Gump " , they played stand-up rivals in the light comedy " Punchline " . I will say that this isn't the funniest movie that I've ever seen , but it's great just for the tension between the performers , some of the stand-up jokes , and for Tom Hanks's definition of the rectum ; you have to agree that his name for it is a lot more descriptive . So , this movie probably won't give you any kind of religious experience , but it's a fun way to pass time . Also starring John Goodman and Damon Wayans . Oh , and in case Sally Field is reading this : Happy 60th birthday ! I'm in Russia right now , and yesterday , I went to Verkhoturye , where they have a convent . As a semi-birthday present to you , I said that the convent housed a flying nun . I know , you don't like that moniker , but I had to do something . Thanks for everything .
362633	4888011	104802	7.0	nice intro to mambo	When I watched " The Mambo Kings " , I knew little if anything about that kind of music , so it sort of made the movie even more of a treat to hear it for the first time . In fact , I try to imagine living in New York in the early ' 50s and hearing the brothers bring their music to America for the first time ; it must have been an experience unlike any other . But no matter , Armand Assante and Antonio Banderas did a really impressive job in their roles . It's no accident that this movie started Banderas on the career path that he's had ever since . Is this the greatest movie of all time ? Not by any stretch . But I , for one , always like to learn about new types of music , so I have to give the movie credit for that . I recommend it . Also starring Cathy Moriarty and Desi Arnaz Jr .
363325	4888011	113972	7.0	acceptable	Johnny Depp continued his interesting streak ( preceded by " What's Eating Gilbert Grape " , " Ed Wood " and " Don Juan DeMarco " ) with " Nick of Time " . He plays accountant Gene Watson , whose daughter gets kidnapped . The kidnappers ( Christopher Walken and Roma Maffia ) give him a envelope and tell him to murder the person on the photo within the next hour and 15 minutes or his daughter dies . It raises the stakes when it turns out that they want him to assassinate the governor ( Marsha Mason ) , and there's a conspiracy at work . I will admit that this movie isn't really anything special , but happening in real time heightens the suspense . Also starring Charles S . Dutton .
365861	4888011	113957	7.0	not too realistic , but what it portrays should be a cause for concern	When " The Net " was first being advertised , the ads made it look ridiculous . Then , when I saw it , it was actually quite good . Angela Bennett ( Sandra Bullock ) spends her days working on the computer and has never gotten to know her neighbors . Then , through a series of events , her identity gets erased by a cabal of shadowy people , and she can't prove that she exists . Some parts of the movie are a little bit far-fetched ; you'd probably know which parts if you saw the movie . Still , it's a good look into what the existence of the Internet may have wrought on unsuspecting people . I do recommend it .
363271	4888011	121766	7.0	So it's complete .	You may have heard how " Star Wars : Episode III - Revenge of the Sith " ends , so I'll just talk about a few aspects . The line " Either you're with me or you're my enemy " sounds a lot like " Either you're with us or you're with the terrorists " ( although George Lucas wrote the script before September 11 ) . But I would have said a long time ago that George W . Bush is basically the same as Darth Vader . In some way , maybe the movie is sort of a video game , but that one line made it really good . Ewan McGregor , Natalie Portman , Hayden Christensen , Ian McDiarmid , Samuel L . Jackson , and Christopher Lee certainly do the best with their roles . Acceptable for what it is .
364460	4888011	120889	7.0	Does a great job dealing with death .	Some people have treated " What Dreams May Come " with scorn due to Chris Nielsen's ( Robin Williams ) affirmations that he can do anything , even if it violates the laws of nature . I beg to differ . The movie shows how he blames himself for his wife Annie's ( Annabella Sciorra ) suicide , and feels compelled to rectify this . Maybe some people thought that the movie was trying too hard to be like a painting but ended up a series of shots of Robin Williams trying to be emotional . Neither description would do the movie justice . This movie is not all about special effects . I think that it forces us to reconsider our own destinies , and what may become of everything after we die . All in all , a really impressive movie . Also starring Cuba Gooding Jr and Max Von Sydow .
362863	4888011	482606	7.0	they made something really creative here	I knew nothing about " The Strangers " when I started watching it . When it became clear that the movie was a horror flick , I figured that it was going to be a typical slasher . But there's more to it than that . A message at the beginning tells the audience that the depicted events are true ( or at least a possibility of what happened ) . We get introduced to James Hoyt ( Scott Speedman ) and Kristen McKay ( Liv Tyler ) , apparently having some problems . But then a young woman comes to their door and asks for a person who doesn't live in the house . She later returns , and noises start appearing around the house . That's when the real story sets in . The horror derives from never knowing who the killers are , or what their motives are . They are just masked figures with no aim except to torment James and Kristen . Because of the timing and editing in some scenes , I doubt that you'll be able to watch this movie without jumping in at least one scene . I should identify that this isn't a great movie . There are some clichés like heavy breathing and sobbing ( or might the true story have happened like that ? ) . But they do the right thing by keeping gore to a minimum and letting the story develop . Therefore , I recommend " The Strangers " .
364947	4888011	105629	7.0	sort of toying around , sort of not	Around the same time that he starred in - and hilariously carried - " Aladdin " , Robin Williams starred in another movie clearly intended for kids : " Toys " . He plays toy company heir Leslie Zevo , trying to stop his uncle ( Michael Gambon ) from taking over the company and using it to make war toys . Yeah , it's a pretty simple plot - and maybe the movie's only really interesting once - but there's plenty of scenes that make it all worthwhile , namely the crossword scene and the scene where the spy camera has an unexpected experience . At times , the movie does seem like it's trying to tweak at your emotions , but it's mostly pretty good . Granted , I do prefer the previous movie in which Barry Levinson directed Robin Williams ( by which I mean " Good Morning , Vietnam " ) . Also starring Joan Cusack , Robin Wright , LL Cool J , Donald O'Connor , Arthur Malet , Jack Warden , and Jamie Foxx ( as a joke , I'll say what that translates to : the " In & Out " bride , Forrest Gump's sweetheart , a rapper , one of the people who didn't sing in the rain , Mr . Dawes Jr from " Mary Poppins " , Warren Beatty's frequent co-star , and Ray Charles ) .
365593	4888011	59831	7.0	always a guilty pleasure with Ursula Andress on screen	Back in the ' 60s , everyone loved a cool spy flick . James Bond , Derek Flint , Harry Palmer ( and even Maxwell Smart ) were the famous secret agents , but probably not as many people remember " Les tribulations d'un chinois en Chine " . It has French everyman Arthur Lempereur ( Jean-Paul Belmondo ) getting involved in espionage in Hong Kong . A really fun scene is the whole chase scene . However , in my opinion , the intrigue and stuff gets overshadowed by Ursula Andress's presence . There's one scene in particular that will very likely remind you of her role in " Dr . No " . So , there always had to be spy stories involving hot babes . A flick similar to this one is " Die Holle von Macao " ( also called " The Corrupt Ones " ) which starred Elke Sommer . You'll probably like both movies .
362866	4888011	44046	7.0	mission im-possum-ble	One of Robert McKimson's miscellaneous cartoons features a pair of hick possums trying to get their lazy son to do chores , to the point where the father dresses as a dog to scare the tyke . . . but the little guy turns out to be the Road Runner of possums ! Two of McKimson's one-shot cartoons that come to my mind feature animals not usually seen in Warner Bros . cartoons . Aside from " Sleepy Time Possum " there was " Swallow the Leader " ( starring swallows ) . I wonder what was up with that . Whatever it was , this is still worth seeing . Watching McKimson's cartoons , I notice that his characters have really prominent mouths , as opposed to the prominent eyes in cartoons by other directors ( compare the Bugs Bunny in Chuck Jones's and Friz Freleng's cartoons with that in McKimson's cartoons ) . All in all , the possum-bilities are limitless .
363249	4888011	149367	7.0	Paul Newman , RIP	Two days ago , one of the greatest actors of all time left this life . Paul Leonard Newman was best known for films like " Hud " , " Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid " and " The Verdict " . But he also starred in small , less noticed movies over the years . One example is " Where the Money Is " . Newman plays an aged crook who moves into a nursing home where it becomes clear to the woman ( Linda Fiorentino ) running the place that he's not as disabled as he claims to be and might in fact be looking for help in pulling off another heist . OK , so an elderly criminal going in for one last scheme is sort of a hackneyed plot . But in this role , Newman doesn't even need to talk much ; it seemed to me as if his eyes functioned as actors . Not to mention that there's some great chemistry between him and Fiorentino . This might not be the most noticeable movie , but it's worth seeing , if only once . There will never be another Paul Newman . Also starring Dermot Mulroney .
363282	4888011	44153	7.0	We now know where the Acme factory is located .	While accompanying his owners to a certain national park , Sylvester finds a nest and decides to wait for the egg to hatch . Guess who comes out ! While most of " Tweet Tweet Tweety " has the usual sorts of gags - albeit in a forest setting - there was one thing that I saw that should be of particular interest to Looney Tunes fans : the Acme factory . That fictional corporation from which Wile E . Coyote receives every catch-the-Road-Runner gadget ever conceived of turns out to be located in this national park ( we find this out when Sylvester goes there and . . . well , I'll let you see what happens ! ) . But even ignoring that entirely , this is a really funny cartoon . True , we know what sorts of things are going to happen , but it's just a pleasure to watch them happen , and to see Tweety turn into a bad-ass ( he actually did have kind of a mean streak when you think about it ) . Worth seeing .
364328	4888011	28245	7.0	mutiny on the Porky	The early , morbidly obese Porky Pig had only existed for a little over a year ( and Mel Blanc was not yet providing his voice ) when he appeared in " Shanghaied Shipmates " . The cartoon portrays a sadistic captain kidnapping Porky and several other sailors to use as his crew . The whole voyage is practically a torture chamber . Sure enough , they eventually rebel . Knowing that this came out the year after " Mutiny on the Bounty " got released , I wonder whether or not the latter gave them the idea to make it . Since they were still getting started , we should understand not to expect any of the completely wacky stuff that became their cornerstone during the ' 40s and ' 50s . Anyway , it's an OK cartoon . Warner Bros . returned to this topic with the Bugs Bunny-Yosemite Sam vehicle " Mutiny on the Bunny " . Worth seeing , if only once . Available on YouTube .
364840	4888011	97322	7.0	On the piano , folks !	Maybe " The Fabulous Baker Boys " was mostly one of those " small " movies , but it was certainly well-done . Jack ( Jeff Bridges ) and Frank Baker ( Beau Bridges ) are professional musicians whose lives consist of playing in clubs . Figuring that they need a back-up singer , they hire Susie Diamond ( Michelle Pfeiffer ) . But her presence reveals the flaws in Jack's and Frank's lives , and specifically , their relationships with each other . I don't know much about professional music to really comment further , but this was certainly an interesting flick . The Bridges brothers played the pianos on their own , and one can clearly see it . Definitely worth seeing .
365555	4888011	110971	7.0	Shakespeare in the army	Halt thyself , thou knave . I shall tell thee of a film in which a great thespian of our time plays a man who teacheth a group of milit'ry people about one of the greatest playwrights of all time . Never have these men and wenches known such masterful work , but eager they are to learn . OK , I'll cut the Shakespearean talk . But the point is that " Renaissance Man " is a really cool movie , with Danny DeVito as a literature teacher who joins the army and teaches some of the recruits about Shakespeare . This was certainly one of the under-appreciated comedies of the 1990s ( specifically , one showing that you don't need scatological humor to make a good comedy ) . At the very least , it should be interesting to see Mark Wahlberg in his film debut . But even beyond that , I would say that there's lots to admire here . I definitely recommend it . Also starring Kadeem Hardison and Cliff Robertson .
363439	4888011	120787	7.0	a plot as perfect as the murder planned	Steven ( Michael Douglas ) and Emily Taylor ( Gwyneth Paltrow ) look like the typical rich New Yorkers : he's twice her age , they live in a high-rise , and both have prestigious jobs . But she doesn't know that he's planning to have her killed to pay off his debts . And he doesn't know that she's cleverer than he thinks . " A Perfect Murder " does a very good job updating " Dial M for Murder " . They keep the suspense going every step of the way . And they really pull some surprises . Equally as good as the aforementioned stars is Viggo Mortensen ; he gives sort of an air of Aragorn's bad side . But either way , this is certainly a movie that I recommend . Also starring Sarita Choudhury .
365606	4888011	790741	7.0	keeping up with the Dickens	Somewhat confusing story about a Londoner ( Vinnie Jones ) who gets involved in a web of intrigue centering on newly discovered Charles Dickens manuals . I spent much of the movie wondering how much of the stuff about Dickens himself was true ; I would like to know more about Charles Dickens as a person . Other than that , the acting kept the movie afloat . Aside from Jones , Derek Jacobi , Julie Cox , Vanessa Redgrave and Jason Flemyng turn in very good performances . It's just that I felt that the movie didn't tell as much about Charles Dickens as I would have wanted to hear . Pretty good otherwise .
365726	4888011	120660	7.0	newly relevant	The first time that I saw " Enemy of the State " advertised , it looked totally formulaic and idiotic . It appeared to be about someone planting something on Will Smith , so Smith has to take matters into his own hands . I thought : " Oh , and I bet that they didn't know who they were messing with when they put it in HIS pocket . " When I saw the movie much later , I was surprised . Now , I will admit that parts of the movie are predictable ( such as the end ) , but the whole thing about surveillance was actually quite interesting , especially with the recent NSA scandal . Therefore , this movie seems better many years after its release than at the time of its release ( just the opposite of what one would expect ) . So , it's not a masterpiece by any stretch , but worth seeing . Also starring Gene Hackman , Barry Pepper , Jon Voight , Regina King , Ian Hart , Lisa Bonet , Jake Busey , Scott Caan , Jamie Kennedy , Jason Lee , Gabriel Byrne , Jack Black and Jason Robards . So have YOU ever gotten the feeling that you were being watched ?
363907	4888011	444628	7.0	Who would have ever thought that " Henry Fool " could have a sequel ?	When I started watching " Fay Grim " , I had no idea that it was a sequel to " Henry Fool " . Now , the latter was not a movie that I envisioned as having a sequel . But one has arrived , and it's quite good . I assume that you've seen the original , so I won't explain it . This one starts with Fay ( Parker Posey ) living with her son whom she had with deadbeat Henry ( Thomas Jay Ryan ) . Simon ( James Urbaniak ) is still in jail . One day , the son gets expelled for bringing a pornographic toy to school . But this is no ordinary toy . It holds a secret that explains much of what happened in the first movie . And this secret delves deeper into geopolitics than " Syriana " . I must say that I'm quite impressed with what Hal Hartley has accomplished here . Maybe this one doesn't quite reach the original's quality , but it certainly takes a good look at what's going on in the world . And the end leaves open the possibility for another sequel . Also starring Jeff Goldblum .
363698	4888011	105323	8.0	Nowadays , it's hard to believe that this was directed by the same guy who did " Gigli " .	After twenty years as an A-list star , Al Pacino took home an Oscar for his role in " Scent of a Woman " . He plays blind Lt . Col . Frank Slade , who talks like he's ready to tear your throat apart , but has a heart of gold . Sound like a cliché ? Well it's not . " Scent of a Woman " succeeds where so many movies have failed , probably because Al Pacino is in the lead role ( almost anyone else very likely would have turned the character into a maudlin dweeb ) . Anyway , the story has college student Charlie Sims ( Chris O'Donnell ) agreeing to be a caretaker for Col . Slade , and the colonel takes Charlie on an adventure that he'll never forget . Along the way , a rather unusual event happens at Charlie's college ( that scene will most likely make you at least giggle if not break out into laughter ) , and the colonel sees no choice but to get involved . Among other things , this movie has a number of people who weren't yet famous but would make their marks in later years : Philip Seymour Hoffman as Charlie's friend George , James Rebhorn as the dean , and even Frances Conroy several years before " Six Feet Under " . " Scent of a Woman " is like a breath of fresh air in the stench of so many lousy movies . Which brings us to the question : why did director Martin Brest have to direct that god-awful " Gigli " ?
363143	4888011	105585	8.0	we need more movies like this	In 1992 , director Michael Apted released two accounts of the American Indian Movement : there was the documentary " Incident at Oglala " about Leonard Peltier , and the feature film " Thunderheart " , loosely based on the Leonard Peltier case . This one features the ancestrally Indian Val Kilmer as an ancestrally Indian FBI agent investigating events in Pine Ridge in the 1970s and getting more interested in his own indigenous heritage . If absolutely nothing else , this movie should call to mind the history of Native Americans . They discovered America , but we don't admit it because they didn't colonize the Americas for another country . The Indians have gallantly fought against terrorism since October 12 , 1492 , while we act as if terrorism only emanates from the Middle East . They're reduced to running casinos to stay alive . For the record , at least some Indians don't like the word " tribe " , preferring " nation " . All in all , I really recommend this movie . Also starring Sam Shepard , Graham Greene , Fred Ward , John Trudell and presidential candidate Fred Thompson ( I would never expect a creep like him to star in a movie like this , but he did , and later starred in " Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee " ) .
365403	4888011	80310	8.0	such stories have probably happened many times	When I first watched " ' Breaker ' Morant " , I had never heard of the instance during the Boer War when the Australian army executed some of its soldiers so as to cover up misdeeds by superior officers . The movie does a very good job looking at the story . Aside from top-notch acting by Bryan Brown and Edward Woodward ( among others ) and direction by Bruce Beresford ( who later directed " Driving Miss Daisy " ) , the movie brings up the very issue of war crimes . The charge was that these soldiers had committed atrocities against Dutch South Africans . It was obvious that the entire British army - and its affiliates - had been doing these sorts of things , and that the real problem was the empire's militaristic nature . The army just wanted to make it look as though they were serving justice . And this didn't end with the Boer War . The US army prosecuted Lt . William Calley for commanding the My Lai Massacre , but the architects of the Vietnam War got off Scot free . Suffice it to say , this all applies to the current state of affairs . But anyway , this is a really good movie . Definitely one that I recommend . And I bet that the aroma truly would have been a failure ! As it is , it hardly seems worth talking about atrocities against the Dutch South Africans ( known as Boers or Afrikaners ) , as they were the ones who established apartheid .
363800	4888011	106464	9.0	Betraying one's own people .	Morgan Freeman's directorial debut casts Danny Glover as a cop in apartheid-era South Africa whose son is an anti-apartheid activist . Knowing this , the father has to choose between his people and his job : he basically betrayed his people , but he has to support his family . True , this seems like a plot that we frequently see , but " Bopha ! " ( Zulu for " arrest " ) makes good use of it . They raise the stakes by portraying a new white supremacist police chief ( Malcolm McDowell ) . And also impressive was that scene where the students leave school to protest the teaching of Afikaans ( my mom said that they used to show that sort of scene on TV all the time ) . A really good movie .
363722	4888011	50455	9.0	the bird , cat and dog who knew too much	While most of the Tweety-Sylvester cartoons have Tweety brutally inflict pain on Sylvester or see the putty tat attacked by Hector the bulldog , " Greedy for Tweety " throws a wrench in the works by having all three get injured at once . When the trio runs into a busy street and each member ends up with a broken leg - does minuscule little Tweety have enough of a leg to actually get broken ? - they get taken to the hospital with Granny as the nurse . Sure enough , Sylvester is still fixated on devouring Tweety ( even if it means abusing Hector ) , while Hector is intent on protecting the little guy ( even if it means abusing Sylvester ) . Many years ago , I saw this cartoon as part of the compilation film " Daffy Duck's Movie : Fantastic Island " . But I'd forgotten some of the coolest scenes ( namely the X-ray and the hammer-wielding mouse ) . As for the idea of Sylvester and Hector fanatically continuing their battle while Tweety sensibly tries to get some rest , maybe that's an allusion to the Cold War : the two superpowers sought to destroy each other while smaller , humbler countries tried to settle down . You know what they say : when all you have is a hammer , everything looks like a nail . OK , so I probably went a little far in trying to analyze this cartoon . The overall point is that " Greedy for Tweety " is truly a fine one . Friz Freleng always had some great ideas .
365280	4888011	212338	9.0	for anyone who's ever had to meet in-laws	We all know that meeting one's future in-laws can be an unpleasant experience , but none can be more unpleasant than what Greg Focker ( Ben Stiller ) and Pam Byrnes ( Teri Polo ) go through . Planning to get married , they go to meet Pam's parents Jack ( Robert DeNiro ) and Dina ( Blythe Danner ) . Maybe it's the R-rated connotation inherent in Greg's surname , or maybe it's Jack's status as a CIA agent , but Greg and Jack do not hit it off . Somehow , Greg causes a series of accidents , and it all leads Jack to consider Greg unworthy for his daughter . The whole movie is pretty silly , but at the same time , all so true . One can understand that Jack wants to protect his daughter , but a lie detector test ? And just what about Mr . Jinx ? What is with that cat ? No matter , the movie never gets so ridiculous to the point where you roll your eyes . It's nice brainless fun , but it's nice brainless fun that accurately reflects the world that we inhabit . Oh , and Greg is Jewish while Pam's family is a bunch of WASPs , so you know what that means .
365166	4888011	105089	10.0	Anyone familiar with US foreign policy won't be a bit surprised .	Elizabeth Montgomery spent much of her life trying to break from the " Bewitched " reputation . I would say that " The Panama Deception " , which she narrated , marked her full success . The documentary exposes the real reasons for Bush Sr . ' s invasion of Panama : it was not to stop Gen . Manuel Noriega from drug trafficking , but rather to overthrow him when he was no longer an acceptable puppet leader - and the US army killed almost 4 , 000 civilians in the process . We assumed that this must be the truth all along . For further info on the circumstances of the invasion , read " What Uncle Sam Really Wants " by Noam Chomsky . He explains how , during the invasion , Bush announced an increased arms sale to Iraq and China . This was less than a year after the Tianenmen Square massacre , and less than two years after Saddam had used chemical weapons against the Kurdish city of Halabja . As Chomsky put it , Noriega looked like Mother Teresa compared to Bush's allies in Baghdad and Beijing . All in all , Bush Sr . deserved to get impeached for this . Or the Gulf War ( or both ) . Never doubt what these people are doing when they claim to be sending troops to countries for humanitarian reasons .
364550	4888011	87995	10.0	What an empty life we live !	Watching " Repo Man " , one gets a sense of just how empty our modern world is . The movie has disaffected punk Otto Maddox ( Emilio Estevez ) becoming a repo man , meaning that he repossesses cars of people who missed payments . Through this , he gets to know the wacky punk world even further . But there's one car that may be harder to repossess : not only do various other people want this car , but there's something in the car . . . " Repo Man " may be known as a cult movie , but it deserves more recognition than that . Aside from being a window into the early-'80s punk culture , it shows the disintegration of American society . Alex Cox created a real gem here . Estevez is perfect in his role , as are Harry Dean Stanton as a detective , and Tracey Walter as the strange car's driver .
364898	4888011	497318	10.0	Jon Stewart is the best host ever !	It's not often that I give the Academy Awards ; after all , what is it except self-congratulation ? But Jon Stewart was the perfect host . He was exactly right in his question to Steven Spielberg when referring to " Schindler's List " and " Munich " : what will happen to us Jews next ? The only problem this year was the final award : " Brokeback Mountain " was something new , while " Crash " was a little too safe . But other than that , I liked " The 78th Annual Academy Awards " . Back in the days when only big , overblown , pompous musicals could receive nominations for Best Original Song , who would have guessed that there would be a winner called " It's Hard Out Here for a Pimp " ? But , as Jon Stewart noted , it just got a lot easier for a pimp ! Anyway , I agreed with most of the winners , even if there were some predictable ones ( but don't get me wrong : Philip Seymour Hoffman and Reese Witherspoon both did very well in their performances ) . And I laud George Clooney for encouraging Hollywood to make more movies about what's going on in the world , such as " Syriana " . Knowing what a great host Jon Stewart was , I would like to see Stephen Colbert host the Oscars one year ; in his persona , he could rant against Hollywood for hating America ( let's face it : how many movies has Hollywood made saying anything good about the US of A ? ) . All in all , a great ceremony , especially with Meryl Streep and Lily Tomlin overlapping their dialogue to award Robert Altman ( RIP ) his Honorary Oscar .
365735	4888011	112682	10.0	Franz Kafka , meet French cinema	" La cite des enfants perdus " ( called " The City of Lost Children " in English ) is a movie that I will probably have to describe in several ways . The movie is set in an ultra-surreal French city and the plot involves elderly scientist Krank ( Daniel Emilfork ) kidnapping children to steal their dreams so that he won't age . That is , until orphan Miette ( Judith Vettit ) joins up with strongman One ( Ron Perlman ) to try and stop him . Obviously , if this was a Hollywood movie , we can guess how idiotic the whole thing would be . But this is a French movie , so it is very creative . For starters , there's the look that they give the city : it's surreal beyond what Franz Kafka could have ever imagined , and thus very dark . What we have here is the sort of situation where you literally are always wondering whether what you're seeing is real , much like what director Jean-Pierre Jeunet accomplished in " Delicatessen " . A previous viewer noted that Miette is as mature as an adult , while One is a muscle man but with a childlike innocence . All in all , I can't really do this movie justice by trying to describe it . " TCOLC " is not the sort of movie that you can just watch ; you have to feel like you're experiencing it . Also starring is Dominique Pinon , whom Jeunet always casts . Specifically , Pinon plays several roles at once . Very impressively , I might add .
364479	4888011	61418	10.0	Fight the power !	1967 may go down in history as the year that really changed movies , what with " Bonnie and Clyde " , " The Graduate " and " In the Heat of the Night " . With the younger generation growing displeased with authority , it made sense that " Bonnie and Clyde " should identify with the title characters running from the law . Bonnie Parker ( Faye Dunaway ) and Clyde Barrow ( Warren Beatty ) may have been violent , but they were a challenge to the power structure . A scene that may or may not have been inserted for comic relief is the scene where tag-along C . W . Moss ( Michael J . Pollard ) meets Clyde's Bible-thumping sister-in-law Blanche ( Estelle Parsons ) while in his underwear . And of course , the final scene is beyond mind-blowing . Just imagine how it must have seemed when the movie first debuted . The point is , this movie shows why the word " masterpiece " exists . Just an extra thing . My mom always tells me about how , after she saw this movie when it first debuted , she plucked out her eyebrows so as to look like Faye Dunaway . As it is , looking at Faye Dunaway in this movie , who wouldn't want to look like her ?
362720	4888011	405422	10.0	Sex really does sell !	One of the most innovative comedies that I've seen in years , " The 40 Year Old Virgin " rips up everything . Portraying quadragenarian Andy Stitzer ( Steve Carell ) trying to have sex for the first time , it really gives you an " oh no . . . oh yes " feeling watching the movie . I had some favorite scenes , but I probably can't repeat them here . One thing that was really interesting about the movie is that I think that Andy is supposed to have Asperger's Syndrome ( which would impair his ability to start up relationships with women ) . But believe you me , they did a really funny job showing that ! Anyway , it's a great movie . There isn't a dull moment anywhere in it . Also starring Catherine Keener , who shows herself to definitely be one of the best actresses of our time ( especially considering that last year , she also starred in " Capote " ) . You gotta admit , the recent slew of comedies ( this one plus any movie starring Jim Carrey , Jack Black , Ben Stiller , Owen Wilson , Vince Vaughn and / or Will Ferrell ) is really something else !
365685	4888011	77838	10.0	that era may be gone , but the music never will be	The Band plays its final concert in Martin Scorsese's documentary " The Last Waltz " , recorded in San Francisco . Aside from getting to hear the Band and numerous other great performers ( Bob Dylan , Joni Mitchell , Ringo Starr and Neil Young , to name a few ) , the documentary is also a look back at an era gone by . Among other things , the layered hairdos that they have look a lot better than the spiked hair that we see nowadays . It just goes to show that even if that specific era has passed , the music will never die . This documentary is nostalgia in its best form . May the Band's work be remembered forever ! I recommend " The Last Waltz " to everyone .
362669	4888011	61176	10.0	laughter IS the best medicine , especially for war	Gen . Sherman said that war is hell , but if he had seen " What Did You Do in the War , Daddy ? " , he would have eaten his words . The movie focuses on an American platoon that captures an Italian village in WWII . The Italians are willing to surrender as long as they can have their festival . This creates a problem for the Americans , who have to look like they're fighting . Meanwhile , one of the commanding officers gets lost in the catacombs and goes crazy . Dick Shawn displays the same type of wacky humor that he employed in " It's a Mad , Mad , Mad , Mad World " , and we even get to see Carroll O'Connor , pre - " All in the Family " . Perfect .
364923	4888011	78748	10.0	In space , no one can hear you scream . . . but in the theater / TV room , EVERYONE will !	There may be debates over whether movies should portray aliens positively or negatively , but " Alien " shows that all bets are off . This is possibly THE perfect sci-fi / horror flick ; in fact , it doesn't even suffice to call it such . From the moment when the egg attacks Kane ( John Hurt ) to Ellen Ripley's ( Sigourney Weaver ) battles against the title character , this movie has you tensed up every second of the way . You may be very suspicious of every movement around you after watching this movie . Obviously , what made " Alien " so great was that it had a woman going all bad-ass on a big ugly creature from another world . You probably know about the " chest " scene ( or maybe you've seen a spoof of it ) , but you have to see it to believe it ! All in all , this is a great movie . Weaver turns in a top-notch performance , and great support from Hurt , Harry Dean Stanton , Yaphet Kotto , Ian Holm , Veronica Cartwright and Tom Skerritt , add to the movie's high quality . " Aliens " was also pretty good , " Alien 3 " was tolerable , and " Alien : Resurrection " was . . . well , that's debatable . But this one remains the best . 1979 was truly a great year for movies , what with " Alien " , " Apocalypse Now " , " Being There " , " The China Syndrome " , " 1941 , " . . . And Justice For All " and " Nosferatu " .
364999	4888011	35414	10.0	a more sadistic bird thou shalt never find	In this day and age , we have seemingly come to interpret Tweety Bird as " cute " . In his first appearance , he was nothing like that ; quite the opposite , he was a bad-ass . In " A Tale of Two Kitties " , wandering felines Babbit and Catstello ( spoofing Abbott and Costello ) find a bird's nest . Grouchy , straight-talking Babbit sends the nervous Catstello up to get the bird , only the tiny avian - whose name isn't actually identified - proves to be the nastiest mother ever . There's naturally an anvil gag . It's just great to see how the guys behind the Looney Tunes weren't afraid to show anything that they wanted . Definitely one to see .
365843	4888011	25316	10.0	It shall continue happening on movie screens forever onward .	Stories like this have become such a cliché that we might forget that they started here , but they did . And it worked really well here . When bored socialite Ellie Andrews ( Claudette Colbert ) runs away from her surroundings , she gets picked up by down-on-his-luck reporter Peter Warne ( Clark Gable ) , who knows exactly what to do in such a situation . This movie must be what people mean when they say " They don't make ' em like they used to . " Both Gable and Colbert have a great time with their roles . Apparently , the scene where Gable removes his shirt caused a bit of a stir since he wasn't wearing anything underneath . But that only adds to this movie's greatness . It's a gem in the real sense of the word . Also starring is Alan Hale ( yes , the Skipper's father ) .
363604	4888011	183659	10.0	Ed Harris should have won Best Actor	With " Pollock " , Ed Harris proved himself as adept as a director as he is an actor , playing splatter artist Jackson Pollock . We see Pollock as a talented artist who seemed to grow more and more messed up ( maybe even disturbed ) as the years went by . Equally as good as Harris is Marcia Gay Harden as Lee Krasner , for which she won Best Supporting Actress ( and unlike so many people , Harden can do a believable New York accent ) . All in all , a great movie . I would like to assert that Ed Harris actually did a better job here than Russell Crowe did in " Gladiator " . Also starring are Jennifer Connelly , Bud Cort , John Heard , Val Kilmer , Amy Madigan and Jeffrey Tambor .
363510	4888011	36342	10.0	there's no doubt that this was a masterpiece	You know that a movie is really good when you feel that you can't tell very much about it without giving anything away . " Shadow of a Doubt " is one such movie . Charlie ( Joseph Cotten ) is a man who goes to visit his relatives in Santa Rosa , California . He is so well respected by his relatives that they named their oldest daughter ( Teresa Wright ) Charlie . When Uncle Charlie first arrives , everything seems to be going very nicely and everyone is having a lot of fun . But then , Young Charlie begins to get suspicious . That's as much as I'm going to tell you about the plot , because I worry that any more information will give everything away . However , I will discuss some interesting aspects in the movie . For starters , duality . There are two Charlies , two bespectacled females , two trips to the train station , two trips to the restaurant , and even when Alfred Hitchcock makes his cameo , he is carrying a piece of luggage almost as big as he is . This all may have something to do with the idea that there are two sides to everything ( which turns out to be an important aspect in this movie ) . Also , Santa Rosa looks like a town in a Norman Rockwell painting , but then , everything changes . In one scene , Young Charlie is trying to call people on the phone , but can't reach them . Each time they show her again , the scene is shot from a higher angle , as though she is sinking deeper into desperation . I guess that overall , the movie is about how Young Charlie is forced to grow out of her youthful impression of the " good old days " , as represented by " The Merry Widow Waltz " , played during a repeated scene of a grand ball . The words " merry widow " also play a role in the plot . That is all that I can tell you . Any more would definitely give away the ending .
363849	4888011	71675	10.0	That's what happens when you mess with the environment !	We humans may think that we can do anything without adverse results , but if only we knew ! Mangling the environment is bound to blow up in our faces ! And in " It's Alive ! " , does it ever ! Frank ( John Ryan ) and Lenore Davies ( Sharon Farrell ) drive to the hospital to have their baby . There's just one problem : the new baby looks and acts like something out of a Wes Craven movie . Not only is the infant one mean mother , but the people hunting him are equally brutal : they focus on killing him rather than looking into why he ended up a monster . I've never seen any other of Larry Cohen's movies , but if " It's Alive ! " is any indication , then he must turn out some neat movies . One more thing : I have to admit that the only cast member whom I recognized was Michael Ansara , who played a cop . He was married to Barbara Eden for some years . So Jeannie's husband had to battle a psycho killer baby . Hmmm . . .
365890	4888011	79261	10.0	victory through hair power	For people like me who were born long after the ' 60s ended , we can only learn about the era through cultural artifacts , of which " Hair " is one . This is certainly a well done tour de force . One can get a sense of how things were for the hippie culture . Probably the most impressive scene - for me at least - is when the group crashes the rich people's party . As for the movie's final scene , one might interpret it as the symbolic end of everything that the ' 60s represented . But no matter how one interprets this movie , it's important to understand that even though the ' 60s themselves may have ended , the movements that typified them still exist in small enclaves . It's a time that people won't soon forget . Anyway , this movie is one that I definitely recommend . Milos Forman scored another great one here , right between his two masterpieces " One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest " and " Ragtime " ( so why did he later make a piece of crap like " Man on the Moon " ? ! ) . Starring John Savage , Treat Williams and Beverly D'Angelo .
362654	4888011	280707	10.0	I was rooting for this for Best Picture .	In what may be Robert Altman's best movie since " McCabe and Mrs . Miller " , a plethora of aristocrats and their servants come to an estate in rural England in 1932 for a hunting party . When a murder takes place , it sets the stage for discovering that there's more to these people than anyone realizes . Obviously , that's a loose description , but I don't want to give away too much . But I will note this scene : when Insp . Thompson ( Stephen Fry ) is investigating , he says " Only the people with secrets should be worried . " He doesn't know just how serious he is ! This has the definite feel of an Altman movie , namely the overlapping dialogue . I literally have nothing bad to say about " Gosford Park " ; everything about it was done perfectly . Bob Balaban , Alan Bates , Michael Gambon , Helen Mirren , Jeremy Northam , Ryan Philippe , Maggie Smith , Kristin Scott Thomas , and everyone else all do a marvellous job with their roles . Moreover , this movie's prominence when it came out gave Altman a chance to take a swipe at George W . Bush . Julian Fellowes took home an Oscar for his screenplay ( I was rooting for this movie for Best Picture ) . And now that the Academy is giving Altman an honorary Oscar at the upcoming ceremony , I think that it affirms everything that I've just said here . When Ryan Philippe starred in " I Know What You Did Last Summer " , who ever would have guessed that he would co-star with Miss Jean Brodie a few years later ?
363380	4888011	129387	10.0	Released in the same year as the Lewinsky thing , how could anyone not think about " hair gel " ?	You may not be prepared for some of the scenes in " There's Something About Mary " ( not the least of which is the zipper scene ) , but you're sure to like them nonetheless . The plot of course has loser Ted Stroehmann ( Ben Stiller ) trying to find high school sweetheart Mary Jensen ( Cameron Diaz ) . However , EVERYONE wants to find Mary , and a number of whacked-out incidents ensue . Most famous is the " hair gel " scene , but that's just one of many . With great support from Matt Dillon , Chris Elliott , Lee Evans , and others , this is one gross-out fest that you can't afford to miss . Those Farrelly brothers are truly something else .
363968	4888011	51201	10.0	You must witness this movie	I have never seen a Billy Wilder movie that I didn't like , and to say that " Witness for the Prosecution " is another example of his masterpieces does not do it justice ( pun not intended ) . In the movie , American Leonard Vole ( Tyrone Power , who died shortly after they finished filming ) is accused of murdering a woman in England . He hires Sir Wilfrid Robarts ( Charles Laughton ) , a reputable attorney , to defend him . To get more information about everything , Robarts consults with Vole's wife Christine . But that's where things take an unexpected turn . As the trial - and the movie - progress , we keep learning secrets that the characters have been keeping . By the courtroom climax , all bets are off , to say the least . This just may be the perfect movie . No matter what you suspect , I guarantee that you will be surprised . You will never look at a trial the same again . And above all , it confirms Billy Wilder as one of the greatest directors in history .
363378	4888011	44706	10.0	now this is what I call a western	It has been noted many times that " High Noon " was an allegory for people refusing to stand up to the McCarthy-era blacklist . And a masterpiece at that . Happening circa 1880 , Sheriff Will Kane ( Gary Cooper ) of Hadleyville , New Mexico , has just gotten married to Quaker Amy Fowler ( Grace Kelly ) and is retiring from law enforcement . Unfortunately , he receives news that a criminal whom he sent to jail has been released and will arrive in town at noon . Kane tries to enlist help to fight the criminals , but the townspeople are too cowardly to help out , forcing Kane into the showdown of his life . The movie is a masterpiece from any angle , but the haunting theme song ( " Do Not Forsake Me , Oh My Darlin ' " ) adds to the mood . Cooper won a well deserved Oscar for his role , and this in fact was probably the best performance for all involved . Everyone should definitely see " High Noon " . It may help us one day .
365809	4888011	381851	10.0	there are no WMDs	Since I was never a full-scale " LOTR " devotee - although I will agree that Peter Jackson directed a pretty impressive trilogy - I have to say that my favorite moment from " The 76th Annual Academy Awards " was when Sean Penn accepted his Best Actor award for " Mystic River " : he said ( I don't know whether or not this is verbatim ) " There is one thing that an actor knows , aside from the fact that there are no WMDs . . . " . Kudos also to Errol Morris for repeating the anti-war call when he accepted his Best Documentary Feature Oscar for " The Fog of War " . I guess that the rest of the show was pretty routine , although I liked what Jim Carrey did to present Blake Edwards with his Honorary Oscar . And although I'm not really a fan of Billy Crystal , you gotta admit that his songs at the beginning were a real hoot ( especially the Michael Eisner comment ) . New Zealand and South Africa ( Charlize Theron definitely deserved her Oscar ) both got widely thanked . Which other parts of the world are gonna get that in the near future ?
365249	4888011	465551	10.0	the title sounds a little bit like " Snakes on a Plane "	I expect Judi Dench and Cate Blanchett to play very good roles , but I couldn't have predicted the intensity of " Notes on a Scandal " . Portraying school official Barbara ( Dench ) discovering teacher Sheba ( Blanchett ) having an affair with a student and using it against her , the whole thing keeps you on the edge of your seat . Far from the kindly , aristocratic roles with which she's most associated , Dench creates a cold , vicious character . And yet , seeing the actions of both women , you can't really sympathize with either one . Not surprisingly , it all leads to some pretty ugly consequences . Anyway , don't start this movie expecting either woman to play the sort of roles in which you've seen them before . They both come across as kind of vile , even if they have good qualities . And they both do a great job with it . Judi Dench certainly deserved her Oscar nomination ( although I'm glad that they gave Helen Mirren the award ) . Also starring Bill Nighy . And yes , I thought that the title sounded a little bit like " Snakes on a Plane " . Just imagine Judi Dench saying something like " I've had it with these motherking notes on this motherking scandal ! "
364183	4888011	71221	10.0	when the brothers ( including Dick Hallorann ) fight . . .	Sort of picking up where " Enter the Dragon " left off , " Black Belt Jones " casts Jim Kelly as African-American martial arts expert " Black Belt " Jones trying to stop the mafia from taking over a martial arts training center once owned by friend Pop Byrd ( Scatman Crothers ) . Obviously , the Me Decade was partly known for blaxploitation movies , but that's one of the things that made the decade so great . Here , Jim Kelly really shows off his kicks ( presumably learned by his character in " Enter the Dragon " , also directed by Robert Clouse ) . Well , all that I can say is : fight on , brothers ! Never let The Man tell you what to do !

364157	4888011	51418	10.0	As you can see , Steve McQueen was cool from the start !	You've probably heard the theme song . But whether or not you have , you still gotta see " The Blob " . It's truly a classic sci-fi movie . The acting isn't exactly top-notch , but this is a movie that you're bound to like . The plot goes like this : one night , teenagers Steve Andrews ( Steve McQueen ) and Jane Martin ( Aneta Corsaut ) are making out , when a strange mass from outer space attacks a farmer , and slowly but surely starts taking over the town , getting bigger with each victim . Sound simplistic ? Well we shouldn't expect ' 50s sci-fi movies to be anything else ! The movie is just plain cool . There are some things that we sort of know are going to be in a ' 50s movie about teenagers - namely that the stubborn adults won't believe them , and the kind of dress that Jane wears . Steve McQueen is cool as always , and it's sort of surprising to see Aneta Corsaut ( aka Helen on " The Andy Griffith Show " ) in this movie . Actually , a number of people who later became famous on TV shows started out in sci-fi / horror flicks from the ' 50s and early ' 60s . Frances Bavier ( Aunt Bee on " The Andy Griffith Show " ) starred in " The Day the Earth Stood Still " ; Alan Hale ( the Skipper on " Gilligan's Island " ) starred in " The Crawling Hand " ; Russell Johnson ( the Professor on " Gilligan's Island " ) starred in " It Came from Outer Space " and " This Island Earth " ; and Robert Reed ( the " Brady Bunch " dad ) starred in " Bloodlust " . It's surprising that Dick Van Dyke never had to battle 20-eyed gorgothoids from Planet X . But let's not get off the subject . If " The Blob " is a B-movie , it's one of the neatest B-movies out there . And the 1988 remake was actually quite good also .

Part of those lovable cartoon characters ' repertoires has been the stuttering Porky Pig's endless efforts to trap the sneaky Daffy Duck . In " Duck Soup to Nuts " , Porky is hunting Daffy , but of course Daffy keeps figuring out ways to mess up Porky's attempts . I guess that these cartoons are meant to remind us that hunting will not net you desirable results ( think Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd ) . And it's so great to watch slender Daffy play tricks on overweight Porky ( think of them as Laurel and Hardy , or Gilligan and the Skipper ) . Marvellous .
363020	4888011	120901	10.0	Could either of them have been her father ?	If it stars Leslie Nielsen , you know that it's just a totally silly spoof . In this case , they're spoofing " The Fugitive " , with Nielsen as a witless violinist framed for murder . Of , this is just a springboard for a nonsense gag every couple of seconds , often meaning that figures of speech become literal . Or something very erotic . True , the critics will say that these sorts of movies are completely ridiculous - maybe even worthless - but anything poking fun at " Titanic " as they do at the end gets an A in my book . " Wrongfully Accused " is a nice , silly excuse for a good time . And you're sure to have one . Also starring Richard Crenna , Melinda McGraw , Kelly LeBrock , Michael York and Sandra Bernhardt . And remember : nobody cares about the following people . . .
365885	4888011	59825	10.0	this train is no mystery	John Frankenheimer directed Burt Lancaster in a troika of really good movies : " The Birdman of Alcatraz " , " The Train " and " Seven Days in May " . " The Train " tells the story of some French Resistance fighters trying to stop the Nazis from seizing the country's great art collection by stopping their train . Lancaster has the role of a lifetime as Paul Labiche , leading the Resistance . Paul Scofield also does a great job as Col . Von Waldheim , as vile as anyone would expect a Nazi Kommandant to be . Some of the scenes that they filmed are more than impressive . This may be THE movie that shows why John Frankenheimer epitomized the cinematic new wave in the ' 60s , along with Norman Jewison and Mike Nichols .
364786	4888011	79367	10.0	What a life !	Steve Martin plays Navin Johnson , a loser who hits it big when he designs an unusual set of glasses . I don't know whether this was Martin's funniest performance ever , or even whether this was his funniest movie Carl Reiner-directed movie ( the others are " Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid " , " The Man with Two Brains " and " All of Me " ) . But believe you me , IT WAS FUNNY ! A rags-to-riches story with a series of gags , you can't stop laughing , especially when you watch Navin's trouble keeping time when his family is playing music ( note : Navin's family is black , and he believes himself to be African-American , only to later find out that he's white ) , and later when you hear Navin's dog's name . There's some good support from Bernadette Peters as Navin's wife Marie , Jackie Mason as one of Navin's employers , and Carl Reiner as himself . Hilarious as only Reiner could do it .
363519	4888011	94737	10.0	Happy 50th , Tom !	As today is Tom Hanks's 50th birthday , I thought it appropriate to review one of his funniest movies . " Big " portrays a boy who wishes to be big , and gets turned into an adult ( Hanks ) , thereby having to learn on his own how to navigate the adult world . As a previous reviewer noted , the movie also does a good job showing how he comes to realize that it is better to experience childhood before growing up . But even aside from all that , you gotta figure that Tom Hanks must have really had fun playing the role , especially in the scene right after the boy grows up overnight . It just goes to show what a great director Penny Marshall is ; in fact , she later directed Hanks in " A League of Their Own " . Also starring Elizabeth Perkins , Robert Loggia , John Heard , Jon Lovitz and Mercedes Ruehl . You know , it seems like ever since Tom Hanks got into serious roles , people have forgotten how great his comedic ones were . I can't understand why " Joe vs the Volcano " and " Bonfire of the Vanities " are regarded with such scorn .
364957	4888011	94721	10.0	Now this is life after death !	You gotta figure that only Tim Burton could come up with this ! An ultra-zany story of rural couple Adam ( Alec Baldwin ) and Barbara Maitland ( Geena Davis ) , who accidentally get killed and witness a tasteless couple moving into their house , forcing them to hire " bio-exorcist " Beetle Juice ( Michael Keaton ) , is truly something else . With a new joke almost every minute , the movie never gets dull . And how about that soundtrack ? " Day-O " in the most morbid comedy ever ? Yep , it's all here . Great support from Catherine O'Hara and Jeffrey Jones as the tasteless couple , Winona Ryder as their disaffected daughter Lydia , and Sylvia Sidney as afterlife counselor Juno , make this one of the coolest movies of 1988 !
364437	4888011	41598	10.0	Bugs Bunny is the best	When I try to decide which is the best Looney Tunes cartoon ever , it's a shoo-in between " Long-Haired Hare " and " What's Opera , Doc ? " . In " Long-Haired Hare " , Bugs Bunny is singing some songs and playing instruments to accompany them , when overstuffed opera singer Giovanni Jones smashes Bugs ' instruments and ties him up . Bugs affirms to the camera " Of course you realize this means war . " So , when Jones is performing at the Hollywood Bowl , Bugs plays all sorts of tricks on him . Best of all are the hand directions . This is a veritable triumph-of-the-underdog story . You just can't go wrong with the classic Bugs Bunny cartoons . Perfect .
364948	4888011	120812	10.0	buddy comedies ever after	Obviously , " Rush Hour " is mostly just another buddy comedy , but there's so much hilarious dialogue between Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker , that it's all worthwhile . When a consul's daughter gets kidnapped , Tucker gets hired to take the case , but Chan gets brought in from Hong Kong to assist . Naturally , they have a very hard time cooperating . I guess that a major aspect of these movies is that you shouldn't try to take them seriously ; just accept them as completely crazy . With Chan doing his martial arts and Tucker being a loudmouth , it's a great time from start to finish . Also starring Elizabeth Pena , Chris Penn , and Tom Wilkinson . I liked the sequel equally .
363451	4888011	59026	10.0	You won't end up saying " Good grief ! "	Charles Schulz's death a few years ago ( in fact , a few weeks after " Peanuts " ended ) , brought to mind his creations . Obviously , " A Charlie Brown Christmas " was one of them . And it remains a classic to this day . The plot of course has Charlie Brown getting put off by the commercialism surrounding Christmas and looking for the holiday's true meaning . I really liked the tree scene . With the way that Bill O'Reilly and company like to claim that there's an " anti-Christmas " war going on with people trying to replace " Christmas " with " holiday " , it's good to know that Charles Schulz and company could always find something meaningful to do .
363775	4888011	110932	10.0	Might " Jeopardy " be rigged ?	I was rooting for " Quiz Show " to win Best Picture for 1994 ( although I've since sided with " The Shawshank Redemption " ) . Portraying the real-life story of a rigged 1950s game show , the movie captures 1950s TV the same way that " Good Night , and Good Luck . " does . We also see how after they get tired of letting one person win , they switch to another person . It makes one wonder whether such things might happen on " Jeopardy " . As it was , this movie came out right after I had first heard of Robert Redford ( I had just seen " Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid " ) . This one certainly affirmed what a great presence he is one the screen , whether in front of the camera or behind it . Ralph Fiennes , Rob Morrow , John Turturro , Paul Scofield , David Paymer , Hank Azaria and Mira Sorvino are all splendid in their roles ( Martin Scorsese and Barry Levinson also make guest appearances ) .
365824	4888011	173716	10.0	How many movies has the MPAA censored today ?	John Waters continues his trashing of " traditional " Americanism with the raucous " Cecil B . DeMented " , in which an indie filmmaker ( Stephen Dorff ) kidnaps an air-head actress ( Melanie Griffith ) and makes her star in his anti-Hollywood flick in which they go around attacking anything associated with Tinseltown - especially family-oriented stuff . And the best part : he's working with a budget of zero ! It's like the Patty Hearst story taken one step further ( Ms . Hearst even appears in the movie ) . This seems like the sort of movie that had probably been in the works for years . Regardless of anyone's opinion of " Forrest Gump " and " Patch Adams " , we can likely agree that they don't need to get extended . A really funny , great movie . Also starring Mink Stole and Kevin Nealon . Choosing the " Flintstones " sequel over a Pasolini movie . I bet that some people would do that .
365216	4888011	32976	10.0	Hitch comes to Hollywood	Alfred Hitchcock's first Hollywood movie won Best Picture and Cinematography ( unfortunately , he didn't take home a Best Director Oscar ) . " Rebecca " portrays widower Max de Winter ( Laurence Olivier ) and an unnamed woman ( Joan Fontaine ) getting married . But on their honeymoon , she discovers that the memory of Max's first wife is apparently haunting him in multiple ways . And servant Mrs . Danvers ( Judith Anderson ) isn't exactly what she seems . The possible common Hitchcock theme that one can see in this movie is the murderous gays : there's the possibility that Mrs . Danvers is a lesbian . I don't know whether or not Hitch was a homophobe , but one can see the theme . Either way , " Rebecca " remains a classic .
363167	4888011	50194	10.0	Termite Terrace's folks needn't be anonymous ( especially since AA is essentially a religion )	" Birds Anonymous " is one of the many classic Looney Tunes cartoons that comes across funnier when you're an adult than when you're a kid , as you understand what it's spoofing . In this case , the target is Alcoholics Anonymous , as Sylvester enters an organization that helps cats break their bird addiction . But it's not that easy for him to think about anything other than Tweety ( it's hard to deny that felines really develop dependencies on avians ) . They hit it right on the nail with this cartoon . The meeting early on shows cats talking about how their bird addictions were running their lives into the ground until the organization saved them . And when the organization's rep Sam catches Sylvester trying to eat Tweety , Sam goes off on a speech about how this one snack will open Sylvester's addiction back up ! I actually think that it's really good that they spoofed Alcholics Anonymous . Once , I was watching Penn & Teller's show , and they said that AA is basically a religion . Aside from the fact that a " 12-step program " is a rather dogmatic idea , AA apparently hasn't changed it's modus operandi since its creation in 1935 . But if AA helps people break their addiction , then it probably balances everything out . Anyway , this is a really funny cartoon . Like I said , it becomes funnier once you're old enough to understand it ( as do many if not most of the classic Looney Tunes cartoons ) . It certainly deserved its Oscar .
