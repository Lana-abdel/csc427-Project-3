365164	4888011	260571	1.0	Why study them ? So that Mike , Servo and Crow can make fun of them !	How in the name of anything holy can " Why Study Industrial Arts ? " claim to be an educational film ? ! If this is education , then I'd rather be an idiot ! Actually , this movie could have only been created by an idiot . The only reason that it's even worth talking about is because " MST3K " once showed this drudgery . As you might imagine , Mike , Servo and Crow had plenty of funny comments . If I ever make an educational film , it will be a promotion of vegetarianism . Here's the plot : in 1950s suburban America , mom and dad are trying to feed little Jimmy meat . Jimmy breaks out into a song ( to the tune of " U Can't Touch This " ) about why he chooses to be a vegetarian . Yeah , that's my kind of educational film .
363620	4888011	120891	1.0	I'm assuming that the original series wasn't like this .	The only reason to watch the god-awful " Wild Wild West " is to see Kevin Kline as a neat foil to Will Smith . Otherwise , the whole movie's a mess . The " plot " has agents Jim West ( Smith ) and Artemus Gordon ( Kline ) trying to stop nefarious Dr . Arliss Loveless ( Kenneth Branagh ) from dismantling the United States . Yes , this does sound like a potentially great idea , especially given the cast ( which also includes Salma Hayek and M . Emmet Walsh ) . Unfortunately , the whole movie makes you feel like you just got your head banged against a brick wall . There are a few good scenes , but only a few ; the rest of the movie is just a rehash of better movies . Relying way too much on special effects , this movie makes one feel great that 1999 remains best known for movies like " The Blair Witch Project " and " American Beauty " .
363597	4888011	52077	1.0	A moronic masterpiece	In " Ed Wood " , the title character ( Johnny Depp ) says of " Plan 9 from Outer Space " : " This is the one I'll be remembered for . " If only he had known ! This is his most famous movie all right , but only because it's got everything wrong with it possible , to the extent that it's hilarious . The space ships look strangely like paper plates , the set looks like a set ( mainly because the actors often bump into it ) and the acting creates a paradigm of non-acting ( " Was it a hot blast of air or a cold blast ? " " I don't know . It was just a blast of air . " ) . Because of this idiocy , " Plan 9 from Outer Space " is a piece of cinematic history that you can't afford to miss . It is quite literally so bad that it's good . It's not even a B-movie , but essentially a C-movie . To be precise , the " Citizen Kane " of C-movies . So just what were the previous eight plans ?
365112	4888011	279772	1.0	A rebuttal to " Roger and Me " . . .	. . . was how Crow defined " Design for Dreaming " when he , Servo and Mike had to watch it . It portrays a happy-go-lucky woman living a fantasy in which a jolly man buys her any car that she wants , and a kitchen has all the appliances that a 1950s housewife could ask for . Very much a product of the 1950s . A previous reviewer called this short " I Dream of Jeannie " on LSD . I thought that it looked like the Broadway sequence in " Singin ' in the Rain " on LSD . But either way , the movie is beyond pathetic , just the sort of schlock that Dr . Forrester would cruelly beam aboard the Satellite of Love to torture Mike , Servo and Crow . In conclusion , the movie itself is , but the " MST3K " is .
365125	4888011	155711	2.0	all flaws with practically no redeeming qualities	You know how comedies are supposed to make you laugh ? Well , " Flawless " makes you laugh , but you're not laughing at what happens in the movie ; you're laughing at the fact that the movie didn't come out very good . Certainly the idea of a homophobic cop having to make amends with a drag queen seems like it could make an interesting movie , but they didn't do it here . The whole thing just drags . The movie doesn't even really have any clever lines . Robert DeNiro should have known better than to star in this , and I think that we can all agree that Philip Seymour Hoffman did a much better job playing a gay person in " Capote " . All in all , pathetic .
365250	4888011	174917	2.0	Back when Ernest Borgnine won an Oscar for " Marty " , who would have ever thought that one of his movies would be " MST3K " - worthy ?	" Merlin's Shop of Mystical Wonders " is too dark to be a children's movie and too cute to be a horror flick . Which makes it perfect " Mystery Science Theater 3000 " fodder ! An incompetent mixture of " Poltergeist " and any wizard movie , it makes one wonder how they got a great actor like Ernest Borgnine on board . Although the movie has 1996 as its date , a large portion of it looks as though it was filmed at least ten years earlier ( a very corny ' 80s look ) . As for the " MST3K " version , jokes naturally abound . I don't remember which jeers came from Mike , Servo or Crow , but someone notes that Merlin probably shouldn't ask women if they've seen his monkey ! And when the ground starts caving in , one of them declares that Bugs Bunny must have missed that left turn at Albuquerque ! Among the famous people who get mentioned are Tom Bosley , Madeline Albright , Bella Abzug and Linda Blair . So just stick with the " MST3K " version and you'll be fine . Yeah , she did look kinda like Julie Hagerty .
362859	4888011	128442	2.0	" Rounders " is totally flat .	You know how there's supposed to be the " Oscar curse " , when a person wins a gold statuette and proceeds to star in a really worthless movie ? Well , it happened to Matt Damon . After he and Ben Affleck won writing Oscars for " Good Will Hunting " , they both starred in some real turkeys : Affleck in the god-awful " Armageddon " and Damon in the go-nowhere " Rounders " . This is supposed to be about high-stakes gambling , but the whole thing runs as if the actors are on depressants . There isn't a likable or memorable character anywhere in the movie . So there's the possibility that a screw-up might lead to danger ? Well , watching this movie , I wished that something would happen to the worthless characters . AND WHY DOES THE GANGSTER ( John Malkovich ) HAVE TO BE Russian ? ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! The point is , you should avoid this movie at all costs . There are plenty of good movies out there , so there's no reason to waste your time on this junk . Also starring Edward Norton , John Turturro , Martin Landau and Gretchen Mol .
365626	4888011	120828	3.0	If the people behind this movie believed that it equalled the original " Swept Away " , they must be stupider than we realize .	In one of Harrison Ford's real low points , he plays a gruff pilot who gets stranded on an uncharted island with stuffy reporter Anne Heche . While Lina Wertmuller's " Swept Away " did a really good job with this sort of situation ( and " Gilligan's Island " made it really funny ) , " Six Days Seven Nights " totally bungles it . It's got to be one of the most predictable movies ever . Overall , the movie brings up two questions : why can't Harrison Ford just stick with what he's good at , and why was Anne Heche getting so many roles in the late ' 90s ? I assume that Ford probably wants to downplay his role in this movie ( although his recent roles haven't been much better : " K-19 " , " Hollywood Homicide " and " Firewall " ) . Ditto Heche . Also starring - and embarrassing themselves - are David Schwimmer , Allison Janney , Cliff Curtis and Danny Trejo . And above all , it showed that director Ivan Reitman was truly declining , to the point that he most recently backed Arnold Schwarzenegger for California governor . All in all , avoid this one .
363609	4888011	113755	4.0	Chevy Chase , he fell from grace . . .	Some events are just so ironic that they just seem too weird to be true . One of the best examples , at least in my opinion , is what happened to Chevy Chase . You see , in the ' 80s he was one of the top stars , with movies like " Vacation " and " Fletch " . Now , he was not friends with the president during that period , nor with the next president , but he was friends with Bill Clinton . That's where it gets bizarre : a few months after Slick Willie took the oath of office , Chase got his own TV show . . . and it failed miserably , turning Chase into a laughingstock . In short , Chevy Chase went from a star under his enemies to a joke under his friend . To compound this , the show's failure was followed by embarrassing movies like " Cops and Robbersons " and " Man of the House " . I will say that the latter isn't god-awful , but it's not really worth much . Mostly just another story about a son and stepfather trying to bond . If nothing else , I guess that it just seems sad that Chase went from " SNL " to this ( maybe it's also the flick's status as a Disney movie ) . But really , Chase has done better than this , as have Farrah Fawcett and George Wendt . Don't make it your first choice .
363150	4888011	44121	4.0	An even colder aspect of the Cold War .	Before James Arness became Sheriff Matt Dillon , he played The Thing , an alien who crashes in the Arctic . Then of course , some people at a research facility thaw it out ( stupid people ! ) and it goes on a rampage . Yadda yadda . . . " The Thing " was mostly just another Cold War movie . I guess that it's worth seeing for what it is . But overall , it's nothing that you haven't seen before . The scene with the dogs may disturb some people , but the movie is otherwise pretty hokey . As for Arness ' assertion that the costume made him look like a carrot , it kinda did .
362913	4888011	52564	5.0	along came a spider-rat	" The Angry Red Planet " will be a treat for anyone who admires sci-fi flicks from the ' 50s and early ' 60s . Basically , a group of astronauts travels to Mars looking for life . They find an over-sized being which appears to be a cross between a rat and a spider . And the Munchkin mayor from " The Wizard of Oz " . I guess that there's nothing particularly unique about this movie ; that era yielded many movies about people finding things in outer space . But like I said , if you have a special affinity for old-fashioned B-movies , then this is the movie for you . Watching the DVD with Spanish subtitles makes it even more interesting .
362738	4888011	114571	5.0	not quite good enough or smart enough , but kind of likable	" Stuart Saves His Family " came out before I had heard of Al Franken , so I took no notice . After I read Franken's book " Rush Limbaugh is a Big , Fat Idiot and Other Observations " , I decided to check it out . It turns out that there's not really very much here . Franken plays Stuart Smalley , a character from " Saturday Night Live " , and the movie portrays him having a crazy family . Why do movies and TV shows always seem to portray families as nearly mental ? I actually giggled when he resorts to name-calling ( " You are a big . . . ! ) , but it seemed like the movie didn't have much of a point beyond that . Then again , few " SNL " skits make good movies . Of course , I might just be too tough on Al Franken ; having read his political satires , I expect the highest quality from him . So I don't recommend it . I do think that Al Franken would make a really good senator ( in case you haven't heard , he's running for senate in Minnesota ) , but for entertainment , he should stick to mocking the Bush administration and right-wing commentators .
363016	4888011	97757	5.0	" Rethinking Columbus " offered some good insight	In 1992 , when most of the country was celebrating the quincentenary of Columbus landing in the Americas , the educational organization Rethinking Schools published a study guide called " Rethinking Columbus " , looking at the real effects that his legacy had . One of the things that it mentioned was portrayals of certain groups in popular media , and it mentioned Disney movies , including " The Little Mermaid " . The three women in the movie are Ariel , Ursula and the maid . One exists only to be beautiful , one exists only to be evil , and the other exists only to get chores done . In short , not good role models for little girls . I guess that as long as we understand that , the movie is probably OK . I actually think that it sounds funny that religious wackos have found what they claim are sexual perversions in the movie . What's really interesting is when one sees the cast : Rene Auberjonois , Nancy Cartwright , Gerrit Graham , Buddy Hackett , Mark Hamill , Kenneth Mars and Edie McClurg . To rephrase that : the " MASH " priest , Bart Simpson , a cult flick star , Benji from " It's a Mad , Mad , Mad , Mad World " , Luke Skywalker , the " Young Frankenstein " cop , and the woman who got cursed at by Steve Martin in " Planes , Trains and Automobiles " . Whoa .
365621	4888011	111003	5.0	a puppet of better movies	OK , how many movies have there been about aliens coming to earth and possessing people ? " The Puppet Masters " doesn't seem like much that we haven't seen before ; specifically , it looks like a remake of " Invasion of the Body Snatchers " . Still , Donald Sutherland makes the most of his role as a really creepy weirdo . It's just that the movie as a whole doesn't offer anything new . Sutherland , plus Eric Thal , Julie Warner , Keith David , Will Patton , Richard Belzer and Yaphet Kotto all pass in a middling movie . In the thick of everything , you gotta admit that those slugs were pretty nasty-looking .
363687	4888011	181151	5.0	strange to think that Mike Nichols directed this	Knowing that Mike Nichols directed greats like " The Graduate " , " Catch-22 " , " Carnal Knowledge " and " Silkwood " , it's a real shock that he directed something as silly as " What Planet Are You From ? " . The movie has space alien Garry Shandling coming to Earth to impregnate a woman after the men on his planet lose the ability to reproduce , and a bunch of goofy things happen . How many times have we seen this sort of story ? It's not a bad movie , but not any kind of masterpiece . A way to pass time at best . Maybe we're too cruel to Mike Nichols , expecting some great every time . An OK movie . Also starring Annette Bening , John Goodman , Ben Kingsley , Greg Kinnear , Richard Jenkins ( aka Nate Sr . on " Six Feet Under " ) , Linda Fiorentino and Caroline Aaron .
362761	4888011	33723	5.0	Abbott and Costello needed the Ghostbusters	I prefer it when comedies don't have people occasionally break out into song ( leave that to Gene Kelly , will ya ! ) . But once the unnecessary songs in " Hold That Ghost " are over , the movie gets going . Bud and Lou play gas station attendants Chuck Murray and Ferdinand " Ferdie " Jones , who inherit a murdered gangster's fortune . The fortune is located in what appears to be a haunted house . Since Ferdie gets freaked out by every little thing , you can probably guess what sorts of things happen in the house . The more Lou irks everyone , the more you want him to do so . I really liked the room switching scene . Maybe " Hold That Ghost " was old-school , but it was good for a few laughs .
365738	4888011	113228	6.0	Who would have ever guessed that it's the same place ?	For the most part , " Grumpier Old Men " is pretty silly . Max Goldman ( Walter Matthau ) and John Gustafson ( Jack Lemmon ) are still at each other's throats when Italian immigrant Maria Ragetti ( Sophia Loren ) arrives in town and throws everything into flux . What actually struck me most about the movie was how different the town looked in this one from the original . Obviously , it was a different time of year , but maybe the different look was meant to show how everything might be changing in the town . Other than that , Ann-Margret returns as Ariel , and she's still as free-spirited and vivacious as she was in the original . Burgess Meredith - in his final role - is still the grandfather who can exercise absolute authority over the youngsters , although he now has the hots for Maria's mother ( Ann Morgan Guilbert , aka Millie on " The Dick Van Dyke Show " ) . Kevin Pollak and Daryl Hannah also reprise their roles from the original . . . ah , and there's that fish . All in all , a fairly interesting movie . Not any kind of masterpiece , but it showed that Lemmon and Matthau still had it .
365187	4888011	78736	6.0	Agatha Christie meets " The Twilight Zone "	Until I saw " Agatha " , I had never even heard of the story of Agatha Christie disappearing - or hiding - in 1926 . The movie offers a possibility of what might have happened , portraying the author ( Vanessa Redgrave ) secretly checking into a health spa under a false name , while detective Wally Stanton ( Dustin Hoffman ) investigates . I will admit that this movie is nothing special . If anything , it's sort of just a way to pass time . But it is interesting not only learning about this part of history , but seeing this speculation of what might have happened ( the movie reminds us that this is only speculation ) . The only other cast member whom I recognized was Timothy Dalton as Agatha's husband Archibald . Not a masterpiece by any stretch , but worth seeing nevertheless .
365385	4888011	481369	6.0	I can find yet another loose connection to 23 .	OK , " The Number 23 " features Jim Carrey in another dark role . This time , he plays dog catcher Walter Sparrow , feeling sort of uncomfortable with his job . His wife Agatha ( Virginia Madsen ) gives him a book with the same title as the movie . It not only tells a story which seems eerily similar to Walter's life , but also identifies various things relating to 23 . As Walter reads further , he begins to sink into madness , worrying that the number might be more than a number . The movie has an interesting plot - I must admit , I never knew that all those things related to 23 - although it seems silly at times ( now that I think about it , the ending was a little predictable ) . I mean , anyone can find numeric patterns if s / he searches hard enough , and it could just as easily be a complete delusion . But more than anything , I like the sinister setting and Carrey's nearly deadpan expression throughout the movie . It does make you wonder whether or not 23 might hold the answer to anything in your own life . Worth seeing , if only once . Oh , and the other loose connection to 23 ? The movie was filmed in Cocoa Beach , Florida . Cocoa Beach was the setting for " I Dream of Jeannie " . " IDOJ " star Barbara Eden's birthday is August 23 .
365276	4888011	86618	6.0	Peter Boyle , RIP	Peter Boyle's death yesterday brings to mind all his movies , including the rather silly " Yellowbeard " . The movie features Graham Chapman as the title character , an 18th-century pirate who gets released from jail to help the British government find his treasure . That's when he finds out that he has a son who has little desire to be a pirate . From there , much of the movie consists of sword fights , one-liners , and Cheech & Chong . Overall , I thought that it was a little bit lamer than it could have been , but I agree with a previous reviewer that it's just neat to see all these people together in a movie . The flick is little more than a way to pass time , but there's a few laughs along the way . Also starring John Cleese , Eric Idle , Marty Feldman ( in his final role ; the movie is dedicated to him ) , Peter Cook , Kenneth Mars , Spike Milligan , and David Bowie in a cameo . And remember : he has a big yellow beard .
365263	4888011	120866	6.0	Blue in the face .	I will admit that I'd never heard of Shakespeare's play " Titus Andronicus " until the movie " Titus " came out - it was one of ol ' Bill's lesser known works . This may be one of the harder Shakespeare plays to understand , but it basically has Emperor Titus ( Anthony Hopkins ) returning from battle only to find doom back home . The opening scene of the boy playing with things was a little confusing itself ( I'm assuming that the original play didn't feature that ) . A particularly interesting thing was that the movie got released in Portland around the same time that " Gladiator " came out , so there were two Rome-related flicks in theaters . Fairly interesting .
363030	4888011	51755	6.0	here's something interesting	Every once in a while , a movie comes along that makes us wonder about certain things that don't happen ; we wonder about how things would be if they COULD happen . " I Bury the Living " is one such movie . Robert Kraft ( Richard Boone ) becomes head of the Immortal Hills cemetery . Strangely , he has an ability that no previous owner has had : by sticking a black pin on the reserved plots on the map , he can kill the person who has reserved the plot . Naturally , no one believes that he really can do this , but then he goes too far in sticking the pins , and other people want him to stick the pins on the map , leading to disastrous consequences . This isn't just a horror movie . They use a camera trick to blur Kraft's vision in some scenes to show his descent into terror and madness . Not until " Heavenly Creatures " would a movie show a person's mental state so accurately . As it was , Herbert Anderson ( better known as Dennis the Menace's father on TV ) played a cop , so this movie had Paladin as the main character , and Henry Mitchell as a cop . It was also directed by the executive producer of " Honey , I Shrunk the Kids " and Gerald Fried did the music ( he later composed the " Gilligan's Island " music ) . Whoa .
364240	4888011	266221	6.0	Why " Shakespeare in Love " ?	I still can't understand why they gave " Shakespeare in Love " Best Picture . I was rooting for " Life is Beautiful " . Even " Saving Private Ryan " and the conspicuously snubbed " Truman Show " were better . But at least they gave Roberto Benigni the two Oscars that he really deserved ; does anyone deny that his acceptance speech was the ceremony's highlight ? I know that some people deride Whoopi Goldberg as a host , but I really like her ( especially with that " 20th century fox " remark ) . Probably the funniest comment of the night was Robin Williams's " Guns and Moses : The Charlton Heston Story . But you can't say Moses ; you have to say The Artist Formerly Known as the Prince of Egypt ! " As for Elia Kazan , I say that honoring him for his movies would be like honoring Pol Pot for stamping out corruption . At least the cameras showed people not applauding ( among them Nick Nolte ) . Overall , a worthy ceremony .
363905	4888011	94849	6.0	the rabbit-proof fence didn't work	In summer , 2003 , I took a class about Australian cinema . We watched films like " Walkabout " , " Gallipoli " and " Rabbit-Proof Fence " ; it might have thrown a wrench in the works had we watched " Celia " . At the video / DVD store , I found it under the horror section , but it's only a horror flick in the loosest terms . The movie deals with a nine-year-old girl ( Rebecca Smart ) in 1950s Australia whose amorality and alienation from society drive her to complete madness ; I think that that was the plot . Certainly it's ugly what Celia does , but seeing what the adults around her are like , I felt that I had no choice except to root for Celia . The historical context involves the Cold War and the government's efforts to stop the rabbit infestation . As people tell Celia not to fraternize with children of communists , she grows more and more disenchanted with the world around her - after all , friends are supposed to be friends no matter what the parents ' political activity . But when a cop takes away her pet rabbit , she really gets nasty ( it also shows that the rabbit-proof fence that lent its name to the 2002 movie clearly didn't work in holding back the leporid plague ) . So how to interpret this movie ? It looks at face value like one of the many instances of a seemingly cute girl having a not so cute side ( think " The Bad Seed " ) . One might say that the rabbits play a role similar to the ones in " Night of the Lepus " and " Donnie Darko " , even though Celia's rabbit doesn't do anything . I guess that it's worth seeing , if only once .
362655	4888011	36452	6.0	The ending seemed a little inappropriate , but it was mostly OK .	Bugs Bunny was still in his relative infancy when they made " Tortoise Wins by a Hare " . It portrays Bugs Bunny angry that Cecil Turtle always wins and challenging him to a race . But this time , Bugs has a dirty trick up his sleeve : he finds out Cecil's secret - his " air flow chassis " shell - and makes himself one . However , this works against him , as the raceway is lined with rabbit thugs who mistake Bugs for Cecil , and keep impeding his performance . The ending seemed like a weird one for a cartoon : when the rabbit thugs realize their mistake , they all blow their brains out . I've always wondered why cartoons would show those sorts of things . But no matter ; this cartoon is mostly acceptable for everyone .
364710	4888011	429487	6.0	What Uruguay was thinking .	A day or two after " The 77th Annual Academy Awards " , I read an article in The Wall Street Journal about how Uruguay's new populist president Tabare Vazquez had just been sworn in . But it said that the thing on the minds of most Uruguayans was not their new president , but what happened at the Oscars : Uruguayan singer Jorge Drexler didn't get to perform his nominated song " Al otro lado del rio " , so he sang a few lines when he won . Aside from that , I wonder just what Martin Scorsese has to do to win an Oscar . I mean , " Million Dollar Baby " was good , but Clint Eastwood had already won an Oscar . As for the whole thing about cutting people off before they have a chance to finish their speeches , what are you gonna do ? And I do think that Chris Rock was a pretty good host ( but I liked Jon Stewart even better the next year ) . All in all , passable .
364831	4888011	59252	6.0	to make your brain swim	No doubt the fact that there were two movies about Jean Harlow in 1965 might surprise some people ; to add to that , apparently neither Carroll Baker nor Carol Lynley was the right woman to play her ( I have to admit that I've never seen any of Jean Harlow's movies - unless you count her appearance in " City Lights " - so I can't comment one way or the other ) . Either way , this " Harlow " seems to go in two directions . On the one hand , it shows how the Hollywood dream looked : the opening scene shows what many people coming to Tinseltown expected , and then Jean Harlow gets to live that dream . . . at least superficially . On the other hand , the portrayals of Harlow's public life and private life make it nearly impossible to determine which is to be best remembered . Here , her frustration with her mother ( Angela Lansbury ) and anger at her stepfather ( Raf Vallone ) get played to almost comic effect . Is every movie star doomed to have something in his / her personal life that has to get sensationalized in a biopic ? So , I would say that this movie takes the same approach to its subject that " Mommie Dearest " did : trashy , but something about the movie gives it an almost desirable feeling . Did I like the movie or hate it ? Well , it has its visuals ( I would call Carroll Baker a visual in and of herself ) , and it sure beats any Steven Seagal movie for smarts . In a way , that's about it . Since I don't really know much about Jean Harlow , I just have to accept what " Harlow " says . It's not outright worthless , but don't make it your first choice . Also starring Red Buttons , Martin Balsam and Leslie Nielsen .
364102	4888011	32909	6.0	even less-than-masterpiece cartoons focus on certain topics better than most movies do	From the time of Porky Pig's debut until about the time that we entered WWII , Warner Bros . mostly cast him roles that they figured represented every aspect of life . One of these was the captain of the Mayflower . Bob Clampett's " Pilgrim Porky " is basically a series of spot gags , the sort of stuff that one would expect in a Tex Avery cartoon ( except that Avery's stuff was cleverer ) . Also , there are some racial stereotypes . To this cartoon's credit , I like it's portrayal of the Mayflower and everything relating thereto better than the story that we've usually been taught . I find it cool to see a mangling of our national myth . Both " The Addams Family Values " and " The Ice Storm " talked about the true significance of the first Thanksgiving . Overall , this one's OK for some brief entertainment . I should admit that some of the gags made me laugh . Clampett directed better stuff over the next few years .
365024	4888011	140864	7.0	yet again , the human male lets his sex drive get the better of him	OK , so " Booby Traps " is chock full of non-PC material , quite offensive in the 21st century . As long as we understand that , it's one of the funniest things imaginable , made as a warning to American soldiers about rigged objects . Dim-witted soldier Pvt . Snafu - complete with his Bugs Bunny-like voice - is trudging through the north African desert , when he comes across a building full of scantily clad babes ( I don't think that they would really allow that in a Muslim country ) . As expected , Snafu not only gets as horny as possible , but the whole building is rigged . By which I mean that when they say " booby " traps , they really mean it ! So , it's a true guilty pleasure . Seeing some of those women , I might have easily fallen into the trap ! Pretty fun .
363347	4888011	78087	7.0	truly identified where Joe Dante was going	Before Joe Dante ( " Gremlins " ) got really famous , he directed this " Jaws " send-up , in which man-eating fishes accidentally get released into a river and swim downstream , looking for people who dared to stick their feet in the water . What makes " Piranha " so neat is how it knows that it's a pretty corny movie , so it just lets the cast be as calm as they want . It elicits some true fun . And the most surprising part is : John Sayles wrote it ! But the point is , you gotta love this movie . If Roger Corman executive produces , then you know that it's good . Among the cast are Dante regulars Kevin McCarthy ( happy birthday , Kevin ! ) and Dick Miller , and also Barbara Steele and Bradford Dillman .
364407	4888011	217869	7.0	M . Night Shyamalan's last really interesting movie so far .	M . Night Shyamalan followed up " The Sixth Sense " with the not-quite-as-great , but no less fascinating , " Unbreakable " . Bruce Willis plays Philadelphia security guard David Dunn , who survives a train wreck that kills everyone else . After this , he meets Elijah Price ( Samuel L . Jackson ) , who suffers from Osteogenesis Imperfecta , which causes his bones to break very easily . Elijah is convinced that David is as strong as the superheros in comic books . But what is there about either of these men that remains to be discovered ? As in his previous movie , Shyamalan creates a bleak setting that may be about to undergo a mind-shattering change . This one isn't as good as " The Sixth Sense " , but you will be shocked at the end just the same . Watch for Shyamalan as the man whom David investigates at the stadium .

In Spain , Marie marries surgeon Diego . Everything looks normal at first , but it becomes apparent that Diego might not be quite what he seems , especially after Jacob tries to drag Marie away from him . What's really neat about " Grimm " is how it plays with the audience . After they leave the Netherlands , you think that the movie's important part has already happened , but you're wrong . Dead wrong . That door in Diego's house gives me the feeling that along with " Hansel and Gretel " , there's also a tinge of " Bluebeard " here . And I wonder if that town at the end is the one where they filmed the spaghetti westerns . All in all , this is black comedy at its neatest .
363205	4888011	52651	7.0	Nice kid , but he doesn't listen to a word you say ( he just sees through it ) .	Poor Foghorn Leghorn . That blustery yokel of a rooster always tries to be the most important character on the farm , but someone always outsmarts him . Usually , Henery Hawk and Barnyard Dog enjoy this luxury , but " A Broken Leghorn " features neither of them . Instead , there's a newborn rooster who Foghorn thinks is going to replace him . Sure enough , every attempt to eliminate the little guy results in Foghorn getting maimed somehow . OK , so we can probably predict what sorts of things are going to happen to FL , but it's neat seeing how for some reason he always finds a reason to keep going ( sort of like Wile E . Coyote ) . A pretty funny cartoon . Roostery . Foghorn makes up neater words than Stephen Colbert does .
363490	4888011	70643	7.0	interesting , but both men have done better	There have been many drifter stories , but " Scarecrow " stands all on its own . Portraying tough Max ( Gene Hackman ) and loopy Lionel ( Al Pacino ) befriending each other while wondering through the world , the movie is admittedly a downer . I will say that the movie doesn't seem to accomplish everything that it was probably trying to do . For example , the scene where Lionel does the act for the kids comes across as silly , maybe even pointless . But overall , the movie is an enjoyable - if gritty - look at searching for one's goal in life ( if that's what it was trying to do ) . So scarecrows entertain birds . . .
365015	4888011	113101	7.0	" rooms " with many views	I seem to recall that when " Four Rooms " came out , it was critically and commercially derided . When I saw it a few months later , I actually thought that it was pretty well done . I knew that Quentin Tarantino was involved in the making , so I could safely assume that there was an element of sleaze in the movie . Well , the movie is likely to blow anyone away , just in terms of how far they go . Portraying bellhop Ted ( Tim Roth ) and his loony experiences on New Year's Eve while waiting on several people in a hotel , they blow everything out of the water . The first two segments are pretty lowbrow : the first one portrays a witches ' coven and the second one portrays a psychopath who thinks that Ted had sex with his wife . But when we get to the third segment , that's where the movie really takes off . Ted has to watch the children of a slick Mexican guy named Man ( Antonio Banderas ) . After a few incidents , Man comes back and finds the room in the most mind-blowing scene imaginable . And , the last segment . Ted , in a totally frenetic state , goes to a room where several Hollywood guys are having a discussion ( with as many curse words as possible ) . What happens at the end of that segment . . . well , let me just tell you that no one sees that coming ! All in all , people who think that the movie didn't go anywhere obviously missed the point . I don't know for certain whether this movie was just an excuse to be crazy , but it sure seemed like that . You're sure to have fun watching it . Also starring Madonna , Valeria Golino , Jennifer Beals , Salma Hayek , and even Quentin Tarantino in the final segment playing a Hollywood type .
365640	4888011	26598	7.0	La Cucaracha dances	True , Friz Freleng's early cartoon " The Lady in Red " stereotypes Mexico a little bit , but it's got some cool scenes , as a bevy of cockroaches party in a café after hours . The title woman performs a sultry dance . But then a parrot sees the action and gets hungry . That's instinct , I guess . As this came out in the early days of Warner Bros . animation , there's none of the full scale wackiness that became their cornerstone throughout the ' 40s and ' 50s . As it was , I notice that a lot of their cartoons in 1935 and 1936 took their titles from songs : " I Haven't Got a Hat " ( mostly famous as Porky Pig's debut ) , " I Love to Singa " and " Let It Be Me " . Anyway , an OK cartoon . Available on YouTube .
362934	4888011	365478	7.0	Well , you know Bruce Campbell . . .	Or if you've seen the " Evil Dead " trilogy and / or " Bubba Ho-Tep " , then you should know that his movies are total farces . With " Man with the Screaming Brain " , he goes all out again . In this case , he plays smarmy American businessman William Cole visiting Bulgaria - when do we ever get to see that country ? - when a woman kills him . So , strange scientist Ivan Ivanov ( Stacy Keach ) replaces half of Cole's brain with the brain of a former KGB agent , leaving him acting sort of like Steve Martin in " All of Me " . Yes , the whole movie is pretty much an excuse for pure nonsense . Much of the real humor comes from " Evil Dead " director Sam Raimi's brother Ted as Ivanov's nearly brain-dead assistant Pavel . The two men have a relationship more like Laurel and Hardy or Gilligan and the Skipper . So just understand that this is a totally silly movie , and you won't be a bit disappointed . I liked it , anyway .
365743	4888011	290002	7.0	ah , family gatherings . . .	By now , we should know that in movies , when WASPs meet ethnic people , there are some wacko situations , as " My Big Fat Greek Wedding " showed . But when the ethnic people are Jews , then it really gets crazy . " Meet the Fockers " makes use of this . Having been accepted by the Byrneses , Greg Focker ( Ben Stiller ) decides to introduce them to his parents in Florida . His parents are Bernie ( Dustin Hoffman ) , who distrusts the government , and Roz ( Barbra Streisand ) , a sex therapist . The Byrneses are very laid back , to say the least , and after a little while with the very open Fockers , Jack ( Robert DeNiro ) once again starts considering Greg unfit for his daughter Pam ( Teri Polo ) , especially since he and Dina ( Blythe Danner ) are trying to raise their grandson to be tough , while Bernie and Roz want to dote on him as they did Greg . Watching this movie , I had to wonder what kind of parents Bernie and Roz were to name their son like they did . Of course , all the Focker relatives had embarrassing names . What a family ! The movie is mostly an excuse to be silly , and silly it was . But the good kind of silly . I just wonder how it would be to experience the Byrnes-Focker reunion . Either way , " Meet the Fockers " is hilarious .
365487	4888011	53211	7.0	New Orleans of the past	In one of the stranger Pepe Le Pew cartoons , the famous skunk comes to New Orleans , where Fabrette the cat is looking for a lover . Pepe is of course perfect except for his scent . What I mean about " Really Scent " being one of the stranger cartoons is that Pepe comes to understand that he smells terrible . What made these cartoons great is that he always believed himself to be irresistible , despite the obvious fact that he repelled everyone . So why have him realize that he stinks ? Oh well , at least they also have Fabrette change herself . Not a bad cartoon , but not the first one that I would recommend ( as a director , Abe Levitow just couldn't equal Chuck Jones and Friz Freleng ) . And of course , this cartoon is also a look at the New Orleans of long ago , before Hurricane Katrina irrevocably changed it . I know that that's not related to the events portrayed in the cartoon , but I notice it .
363468	4888011	313162	7.0	looking back on things	OK , so the Oscars seem to get hyped just a little more each year . And I was rooting for " Gosford Park " to win ( come on , Robert Altman had deserved an Oscar for years ! ) . That said , I guess that it was high time for an African-American to win Best Actress . Contrary to the previous reviewer , Halle Berry's role in " Monster's Ball " was far more original than Nicole Kidman's in " Moulin Rouge " ; I never would have thought to nominate the latter for anything , especially in a year that saw " Mulholland Dr . " . Among the things that I had predicted was the stuff about the September 11 attacks ; I knew that they were going to say something about freedom . Yeah , yeah . Robert Redford should know better . But contrary again to the previous reviewer , Whoopi Goldberg is not the worst host ( among the past hosts was Bob Hope , for whom I have no respect ) ; I really liked her jab at John Ashcroft . So , although I wouldn't have given " A Beautiful Mind " Best Picture , " The 74th Annual Academy Awards " still pleased me ( I have to admit , I enjoy the Oscars more than my own birthday ) . And the day after , as my parents and I were hiking around the dwellings in Bandalier , New Mexico - it was spring break - I was thinking to myself that when Jim Broadbent won his Oscar , that most people watching were asking " Jim who ? ! " I wonder whether or not Woody Allen will ever attend the Oscars again .
364726	4888011	910936	7.0	" express " yourself crazy	Some people's complaint about " Pineapple Express " is that the end scene goes on too long . My criticism is that it focuses a little too much on high action . But no matter , this movie is still a laugh riot from beginning to end , as a pair of marijuana-obsessed goof-balls ( Seth Rogen and James Franco ) have to go on the lam after one of them witnesses a murder . It's the sort of movie intended as completely silly , and it succeeds in every way . A latter day Bill & Ted , if you will . If I thought that the movie could have done anything differently , it was Ed Begley's and Nora Dunn's characters . I felt that it should have developed their characters a little further , even though they only appeared briefly . Otherwise , this flick pleased me very much . A real hoot . Not in the same league as a Cheech & Chong movie , but still really enjoyable . Also starring Gary Cole and Rosie Perez .
363938	4888011	209163	7.0	You kids have it easy . You only have to kill the mummy twice . Back in my day , we had to kill him thrice .	Mostly a rehash of the original , but this time , there's the Scorpion King ( The Rock ) to shake things up a bit . I actually saw this movie in Spain , so the one-liners were often hard to translate . But overall , we now know that movies from the 1930's are to be remade in the 1950's-1970's with a sense of camp , and then remade in the 21st century as crosses between David Lean-style epics and Harrison Ford action flicks ; not only " The Mummy " , but also " King Kong " comes to mind . But now that Brendan Fraser has starred in a Best Picture winner ( " Crash " ) and Rachel Weisz has won Best Supporting Actress for " The Constant Gardener " , I expect no more mummies . And one more thing : why did the Scorpion King get his own movie ? I never saw it but heard that it was just an excuse for buff men to flex their muscles . It was actually released the same weekend as " My Big Fat Greek Wedding " , which of course is much more well remembered . No surprise there .
362763	4888011	71598	7.0	I will forever remember Art Carney as Harry ( I've never seen " The Honeymooners " , and there's apparently no reason to see it ) .	Road movies always make for interesting stories , including " Harry and Tonto " . In a role that won him Best Actor , Art Carney plays retired New Yorker Harry Coombes , who decides to go on a cross-country tour with his cat Tonto . Harry not only visits his son and daughter ( Larry Hagman and Ellen Burstyn , respectively ) , but also manages to live life to its fullest , come what may . Among other things , this movie shows that regardless of what we may assume , old folks still have it even at their age . I guess that when I'm as old as Harry , I'll have to go on a cross-country tour . Who knows what there is out there .
362814	4888011	36052	7.0	size does matter	I notice that " Jack-Wabbit and the Beanstalk " is one of a couple of cartoons in which Bugs Bunny's opponent is a total klutz - complete with a voice like George from " Of Mice and Men " - whom Bugs could clobber without even trying . But even though the giant here is an easy target , it's impossible not to like the wacky series of events ( or the literal ear drum ) . There's one other thing that I notice . This cartoon contains an obvious WWII theme , as the brainless giant claims to be more powerful than Bugs but obviously isn't ( much like the Nazis claimed to be ) . If this is what's going to happen to the US given the current state of affairs . . . well , don't say that they didn't warn us . But I digress . It's a pretty funny cartoon . Other such characters were Beaky Buzzard ( " Bugs Bunny Gets the Boid " ) , Junyer Bear ( " Bugs Bunny and the Three Bears " ) and Pete Puma ( " Rabbit's Kin " ) .
364246	4888011	44578	7.0	These , I say these guys got seemingly no reason to fight , but it's funny that they do .	Somehow , I say somehow the worst things always seem to befall Foghorn Leghorn . In " The EGGcited Rooster " , he has to sit on his wife's egg and not leave it , or else . But when Henery Hawk - dressed as The Last of the Mo-hawk-ens - enters the fray , Foggy naturally sends him to harass Barnyard Dog . Guess what all ends up happening ! Why did Foggy always have the worst luck ? Who knows . The point is that his blustery attitude , and desire to play nasty tricks on Barnyard Dog , always get the better of him . And Henery's pride at being a chicken hawk - in this case , it means a chicken who eats other chickens , not a warmonger who never served in the army - always benefits him . So it's a pretty funny cartoon , despite the stereotyping of Indians . As it's not available on any video or DVD that I know of ( at least not yet ) , you can watch it on YouTube .
364396	4888011	192175	7.0	if past and future really could meet . . .	Prehistory and the space age finally come face to face in this cartoon , as Elroy Jetson's time machine takes the family back to the stone age , where they meet the Flintstones . Then , lo and behold , the Flinstones accidentally get sent to the future , leaving the Jetsons in the past . As anyone might expect , both families have a hard time trying to cope with these new environments . " The Jetsons Meet the Flintstones " is pretty interesting . Granted , it's mostly intended for children , but I would suspect that practically anyone could like it . And overall , seeing what both families experience makes one content to stay in the present , even if the present isn't perfect . A real treat .
365317	4888011	120877	7.0	people can take a bite out of various aspects	John Carpenter was once known as the master of horror ( or at least part of the new wave of directors in the ' 70s ) , but more recently seems to have been regarded with some scorn , with most critics saying that his movies got totally trashy . To tell you the truth , " Vampires " looks like it's trying to be trashy . Specifically , it looks almost like Carpenter got a bunch of people together to party , they filmed it , and added a bunch of gore in post-production ( I admit that I just made all that up as I thought about it ) . But anyway , this movie is a pretty amusing romp , as James Woods leads a group of hunters trying to stop a centuries-old vampire ( Thomas Ian Griffith ) from finding a relic and becoming fully immortal . None of the overwrought pomp from " Bram Stoker's Dracula " , just pure unadulterated fun ; absolutely no pretense whatsoever . Definitely the sort of movie that you watch with best buds . Also starring Daniel Baldwin , Sheryl Lee , Maximilian Schell and Tim Guinee . Back when Sheryl Lee played Astrid Kirchherr in " Backbeat " , who would have ever guessed that she would later star in a John Carpenter movie ?
365677	4888011	59749	7.0	notion : the west is never the aggressor ( but we do get to be ignorant )	It was 1965 . The Cold War was raging . Espionage was in its heyday . That year not only saw another James Bond movie ( " Thunderball " ) , but also the first Harry Palmer movie ( " The Ipcress File " ) , the first Derek Flynt movie ( I can never remember which came first ) , and the debut of " Get Smart " ( an add for that one even called Maxwell Smart " the spy who forgot to come in from the cold " ) . So it's no surprise that " The Spy Who Came in from the Cold " got released that year . I will say that this movie overall is a little confusing , with Richard Burton as a British agent taking on a dangerous mission in East Germany . But there were some things that I noticed in the movie that may back up everyone's stereotypes about the west . Someone tells Burton about the notion that the west is never the aggressor . The people in various colonized countries know that to be entirely untrue . Also , Burton says that it is our right to be ignorant ; we've unfortunately overused that right . But I digress . I liked the movie , even if it was often hard to follow . Far from the idealized , sex-centric world of James Bond , " TSWCIFTC " shows the ugly side of espionage . And it does a very intense job of it . Also starring Claire Bloom , Oskar Werner and Bernard Lee ( I believe that he's the same Bernard Lee who played M in the James Bond movies ) .
363611	4888011	86397	7.0	someone's gotta survive . . . I think	" The Survivors " is characteristic of Robin Williams's movies before " Good Morning , Vietnam " : innocuously silly . In this case , he and Walter Matthau join up after surviving a robbery , and Williams becomes a survivalist . The whole thing is pretty goofy - maybe even pointless - but some of the gags make up for that . I will say that it's not the funniest movie for either star by a long shot ; both have done far better than this . But , it's the sort of movie that you sit around in your underwear and watch ; it does a respectable job showing both stars ' talents . Good for a few laughs . Shooting a man's gun . Ha !
364348	4888011	94939	7.0	Abracadabra and hocus pocus !	Another cartoon compilation ? ! Yes , and this one's pretty clever . It features Daffy Duck opening a business to battle supernatural forces , a la " Ghostbusters " . Probably the funniest part was the cartoon where Bugs Bunny stays in Count Dracula's castle and upsets the count's ( after ) lifestyle , but it was also really something when the sick millionaire threw all the pies at Daffy , and when Daffy scared Porky . Still , I never quite understood the whole part about the money disappearing . So , " Daffy Duck's Quackbusters " isn't quite the same as the classic cartoons , but it's still worth seeing . Don't be surprised if , after watching this , you go around saying " abracadabra " and " hocus pocus " . If I may add something , the two segments with Sylvester were also neat .
363835	4888011	473753	7.0	Jimi Hendrix's song comes to the screen	Ever since Luc Besson directed " The Fifth Element " , it was probably hard to imagine him directing a movie like the mystifying " Angel-A " . But he did , and the movie impressed me . One might interpret it as the same idea as Jimi Hendrix's song in which an angel - whether real or metaphorical - saves a person's existence . Certainly how Angela helps Andre fix up his life in a world that seemingly rejected him , that's a matter of interpretation . But I also detect an allusion to France's treatment of the North Africans ( but that's just conjecture , so don't quote me ) . But overall , I think that Luc Besson is offering hope amidst the turmoil that has engulfed the world . It's a little bit like " Pan's Labyrinth " in that sense . So I recommend it .
364583	4888011	70723	7.0	the wearing of the green . . .	In the ' 70s , Charlton Heston starred in sci-fi flicks of varying quality . " Soylent Green " is one of the better ones . He plays Robert Thorn , a detective in 2022 New York . In this future , most food is so expensive that everyone needs a product called Soylent Green . But when Thorn finds out the unsavory truth about this product , he finds himself on the run . I guess that it's only natural that this movie should seem dated to us nowadays . But even so , it still brings up interesting questions about what will become of our agriculture . Also starring Leigh Taylor-Young , Chuck Connors , Brock Peters , Joseph Cotten and Edward G . Robinson ( in his final role ) .
362866	4888011	44046	7.0	mission im-possum-ble	One of Robert McKimson's miscellaneous cartoons features a pair of hick possums trying to get their lazy son to do chores , to the point where the father dresses as a dog to scare the tyke . . . but the little guy turns out to be the Road Runner of possums ! Two of McKimson's one-shot cartoons that come to my mind feature animals not usually seen in Warner Bros . cartoons . Aside from " Sleepy Time Possum " there was " Swallow the Leader " ( starring swallows ) . I wonder what was up with that . Whatever it was , this is still worth seeing . Watching McKimson's cartoons , I notice that his characters have really prominent mouths , as opposed to the prominent eyes in cartoons by other directors ( compare the Bugs Bunny in Chuck Jones's and Friz Freleng's cartoons with that in McKimson's cartoons ) . All in all , the possum-bilities are limitless .
364172	4888011	89941	7.0	better than you would expect for such a movie	It doesn't quite suffice to call " Runaway Train " an action movie . True , it's got a prison escape and an out-of-control train , but there is actually a plot . After safe cracker Oscar Manheim ( Jon Voight ) and tag-along Buck ( Eric Roberts ) escape from an Alaska prison , they jump onto a train whose engineer suddenly dies of a heart attack . More than simply making every scene a " will they ? ! won't they ? ! " situation , the movie has character development and never moralizes . Nor does it heroify or vilify anyone . The audience is left to develop their own opinions about each of the characters . I won't tell you what happens , but I will let you know that this is one of the only non-mind-numbing action movies that I know .
363919	4888011	28212	7.0	birds	What one notices while watching " Sabotage " is the role of avians . There's the birds in the cage ( like the lovebirds in " The Birds " , maybe ? ) , and after Sylvia Verloc ( Sylvia Sidney ) watches the cartoon " Who Killed Cock Robin ? " , she gets an idea . You see , her husband Karl ( Oscar Homolka ) is involved with some anarchists who have some unpleasant plans . Alfred Hitchcock was showing his skills with this movie . As chaos is often a motif in his movies , you see it here , and this also has the theme of the guilty woman ( or is she guilty ? ) . It's hard to believe that the young woman in this movie is the " Mars Attacks ! " grandmother , but it's true .
362938	4888011	367251	7.0	Let them tell you about some friends they know . . .	What I mainly find interesting about these " making of " mini-documentaries is seeing the cast members all these years later . But even beyond that , " The Yearbook : An ' Animal House ' Reunion " is still quite entertaining , as most of the cast and crew put in their two cents about the production . One of the most impressive parts was footage shot by a Eugene , Oregon , TV station during production . Absent from this are the late John Belushi , Doug Kenny and Cesare Danova - and John Vernon has since passed on - while the still alive Donald Sutherland , James Daughton , Tom Hulce and Martha Smith also don't appear . But the rest of the cast and crew do a pretty good job explaining what all happened on the set ; it all sounded really fun ! So , it's a must-see for any " Animal House " fan . I recommend it . I wonder if Babs and Mandy are still as hot as they were in the movie . . . especially if we see them doing some of what they did in the movie !
364328	4888011	28245	7.0	mutiny on the Porky	The early , morbidly obese Porky Pig had only existed for a little over a year ( and Mel Blanc was not yet providing his voice ) when he appeared in " Shanghaied Shipmates " . The cartoon portrays a sadistic captain kidnapping Porky and several other sailors to use as his crew . The whole voyage is practically a torture chamber . Sure enough , they eventually rebel . Knowing that this came out the year after " Mutiny on the Bounty " got released , I wonder whether or not the latter gave them the idea to make it . Since they were still getting started , we should understand not to expect any of the completely wacky stuff that became their cornerstone during the ' 40s and ' 50s . Anyway , it's an OK cartoon . Warner Bros . returned to this topic with the Bugs Bunny-Yosemite Sam vehicle " Mutiny on the Bunny " . Worth seeing , if only once . Available on YouTube .
363868	4888011	120484	7.0	it may be hard to believe , but I derived some character development	If I remember right , when " The Waterboy " got released , critics called it things like " a deflated football comedy " and " utterly dehydrated " ( and some considered it ironic that Oscar-winner Kathy Bates stars ) . Well , when I saw it a little while later , I did something that probably few if any people did : I derived some character development . It seems that Adam Sandler's character is one of these guys afraid to challenge his domineering mother to the point where he reacts if people challenge what she says , and so football is the only way for him to assert himself . Then again , I might be reading too far into the movie ; it was most likely intended as silly entertainment ( and it mostly is quite goofy , especially with Henry Winkler's Roy Orbison tattoo ) . See what you think . Also starring Fairuza Balk and Rob Schneider .
362850	4888011	158371	7.0	sweet Woody-back's good-ass song	When " Sweet and Lowdown " came out , I was somehow led to believe that Emmet Ray was a real person . Although it turns out that he wasn't , this is still a very well done movie . Sean Penn makes the most of the role , with the same sort of intensity that he always brings to his roles . He shows Ray as a rather impolite weirdo whom you can't help but admire - he is a great guitarist . Samantha Morton is equally interesting as Ray's mute love interest Hattie . It just goes to show that Woody Allen can do good work when he doesn't focus on neurotic rich New Yorkers . Also starring Uma Thurman , Anthony LaPaglia , Gretchen Mol , John Waters , Brad Garrett , and Allen as himself .
365518	4888011	61395	8.0	budding generation gap	Nearly forty years after having collaborated with Salvador Dali on " Un chien andalou " , Luis Bunuel directed the equally bizarre " Belle de jour " . Catherine Deneuve plays an unfulfilled Parisian housewife who decides to take a daytime job as a prostitute . The movie contains two interesting dichotomies : on the one hand , it's never totally clear what's real and what's Severine's imagination ( the scenes where she gets whipped and raped look like her imagination ) . Similarly , we get to see cosmopolitan Paris juxtaposed with the mildly seedy adventures in which Severine takes part . Maybe this is a slight allusion to the budding generation gap , which in France culminated in the student uprising of May 1968 . Or maybe I misinterpreted the movie . But I will say that Catherine Deneuve displays the same masterfully scary flair that she did in " Repulsion " . Every camera angle and every edit combine to make one of the most impressive movies that I've ever seen . I certainly recommend it .
362862	4888011	34870	8.0	Bird impersonates Katharine Hepburn and a fish resembles Peter Lorre ; you don't see this every day !	Bob Clampett's version of Dr . Seuss's " Horton Hatches the Egg " was the first cinematic adaptation of a Dr . Seuss book . And a good one at that . While it does change a few small things , it mostly stays faithful ( like Horton is 100 % ) . Oh , and just in case you operate under the assumption that this is just cute stuff for children : Michael Maltese , in his screenplay , also threw in a some things that moviegoers in 1942 would have understood but 21st century tykes probably won't get ( including a brief instance of mild sexuality on the bird's part ; look what she does to attract Horton's attention ! ) . I definitely recommend this cartoon . Clampett doesn't make quite as much use of contortion as he does in some of his more famous cartoons , but he still pulls off some fine work . The combination of talent from Seuss and Clampett should identify that you're in for something neat . This was one of the many Warner Bros . cartoons released before 1948 that lost its opening credits in the Blue Ribbon reissue .
363068	4888011	59410	8.0	" Six Feet Under " meets " It's a Mad , Mad , Mad , Mad World "	If you thought that funeral homes could only make for grim plots in movies , then you've got a real surprise coming ! " The Loved One " portrays a young Brit Dennis Barlow ( Robert Morse ) coming to the Los Angeles and getting involved in a funeral parlor , with some very zany results . It's the sort of wacky humor that pervaded comedy flicks in the 1960s , right down to the giant cast ( aside from Robert Morse , there's Jonathan Winters , Anjanette Comer , Dana Andrews , Milton Berle , James Coburn , John Gielgud , Tab Hunter , Liberace , Roddy McDowall , Robert Morley , Lionel Stander and Rod Steiger ) . Anyway , this movie really does have something to offend everyone . Goofy but lovable , it's not to be missed .
364052	4888011	90110	8.0	sweet and not sour	In one of filmdom's many biopics , Jessica Lange sinks her teeth into the role of country singer Patsy Cline . We see her go from a bored housewife to a national phenomenon over the period of a few short years before tragically getting killed in a plane crash in 1963 ( although the movie focuses more on her personal life than on her career ) . Not surprisingly , Lange plays the role perfectly . Equally good is Ed Harris as Cline's philandering husband Charlie Dick . " Sweet Dreams " is a movie that has something for everyone . Maybe we wonder how many biopics there can be , but that would miss the point . The point is to understand these people's personal struggles and all . And this movie does a very good job showing that . I wonder whether country music biopics will see a resurgence , now that " Walk the Line " has made a splash .
363881	4888011	89645	8.0	interesting insight into Il Duce's life	Most people remember Benito Mussolini simply as Hitler's ally in WWII . " Mussolini and I " shows his family life during his years as Italy's leader . Starring Bob Hoskins as the Fascist himself , Susan Sarandon plays his daughter Edda , who married Count Galeazzo Ciano ( Anthony Hopkins ) . Among other things , the movie shows not only how the relationships among these people were always shaky , but also that Mussolini and Hitler didn't totally trust each other . Towards the war's end , Il Duce had Count Ciano executed , and shortly thereafter , Il Duce himself was of course arrested and executed . Edda escaped to Switzerland and survived the war . It's too bad that Mussolini was already dead when they hung him on the meat hook . Very well done .
365762	4888011	86617	9.0	must communicate events to the world	A frequent theme in Australian movie is communication issues . Here , one might say that because Guy Hamilton ( Mel Gibson ) is a reporter , it's his job to communicate to the world the events going on in Indonesia . As for Pete Curtis ' ( Michael Murphy ) racist comments towards Guy's half-Chinese dwarf cameraman Billy Kwan ( Linda Hunt ) , racism is an essential part of colonialism . Linda Hunt's role was of course really impressive because she played a man - and won Best Supporting Actress for it . The other star is Sigourney Weaver as British attache Jill Bryant . But of course the most important thing in the movie is the events going on in Indonesia , namely the CIA coup to install Gen . Suharto ( who went on to murder almost 1 million people during his thirty-two years in power , one of the most massive genocides in history ) . A really good movie , as Peter Weir always makes .
363326	4888011	120586	9.0	Why didn't anyone challenge Derek when he became a racist ?	My rating is because " American History X " is very well done in every way , except that it seems that when Derek Vinyard ( Edward Norton ) started spouting out the anti-Semitic diatribe , they should have asked him what became of his humanity . Then again , maybe they wouldn't know what to say in such a situation . But other than that , the movie is quite good . Portraying a reformed Derek trying to prevent his younger brother Danny ( Edward Furlong ) from becoming a white supremacist , we get to see various issues . For example , when Derek is in jail and gets to know a black man for the first time , his anger starts to ebb . Good support from Beverly D'Angelo , Elliott Gould , Stacy Keach and Fairuza Balk make this a very good movie , even if they didn't develop it as far as they could .
363107	4888011	112818	10.0	walking into cinematic history	What's really good about " Dead Man Walking " is that it shows Matthew Poncelet's ( Sean Penn ) side of the story , but it never portrays him as a hero . We understand that , and Sister Helen Prejean ( Susan Sarandon ) understands that . Sarandon definitely deserved her Best Actress Oscar for this movie ( I can't believe that it took her so long to win one ) . Never preachy , the movie shows all sides of the story in looking at Poncelet's approaching execution . Among other things , this movie should dispel the notion that they don't make movies like they used to - although this one is over ten years old . A true classic in every sense of the word .
365637	4888011	52507	10.0	no matter what you call it . . .	No matter what you call it - " Rocky and His Friends " , " The Bullwinkle Show " , " Rocky and Bullwinkle " , or something else - you can't deny how great this show is . A total parody of the Cold War , they hit everything right on the mark . Equally as great as the parts where Rocket J . Squirrel and Bullwinkle J . Moose battle the evil-and-proud-of-it Soviet spies Boris Badenov and Natasha Fatale , are the Fractured Fairy Tales ( narrated by Edward Everett Horton ) , Mr . Peabody's Improbable History , and Dudley Do-Right . Whether Prince Charming turns Sleeping Beauty into a circus attraction , Galileo needs help with a scientific experiment , or whichever dastardly scheme Snidely Whiplash is plotting , it's one of the greatest shows of all time . The " Simpsons " of its era , if I may say so . So , June Foray has every reason to be proud of her work on this . I'll always love it . I never saw the 2000 movie , but every review said that it sucked .
365379	4888011	70510	10.0	" it wouldn't be make believe " . . . and it isn't	Peter Bogdanovich - who turns 68 today - created a troika of nostalgia pieces in the early ' 70s with " The Last Picture Show " , " What's Up , Doc ? " and " Paper Moon " . The last one puts an interesting spin on things . I remember when I saw it , I had just seen " The Sting " and noticed that the two both dealt with conning . But boy do they have something in store for you here . The movie opens with Bible salesman Moses Pray ( Ryan O'Neal ) adopting Addie Loggins ( Tatum O'Neal ) in a Midwestern town during the Great Depression . It doesn't take her long to figure out that the guy's a con artist . However , she turns out to be cleverer than he . I remember hearing about how the novel ( which I've never read ) was simply called " Addie Pray " , and didn't feature the scene in which Moses and Addie sit on the title object at the fair . It's debatable as to whether or not it changed the quality to add that object and change the title . But either way , you can't deny that this movie remains a timeless masterpiece . Personally , I think that Peter Bogdanovich deserves a lot more credit as a director than most people give him ; he has made some really good movies , even if some came out a little lower than we expect . This one is just great . Also starring Madeleine Kahn and Randy Quaid .
365883	4888011	26138	10.0	sequel . . . good . . . pompous remakes . . . bad	" Bride of Frankenstein " is one of those rarities : a sequel that actually ends up being worth something . It portrays that Dr . Frankenstein ( Colin Clive ) and The Monster ( Boris Karloff ) are still alive and still doing their stuff . The Monster continues unintentionally scaring people , while the doctor wants to marry hubby Elizabeth ( Valerie Hobson ) , but quirky Dr . Pretorius ( Ernest Thesiger ) gets him to create a mate for The Monster . In a career-defining role , Elsa Lanchester plays the title character ( assuming that we refer to The Monster as Frankenstein ) . Admittedly , Universal's horror flicks from the ' 30s weren't really horror flicks ; they were kinda silly . But , this one did actually go so far as to humanize The Monster : they let him speak while he was with the blind man . Oh , and in case any of us were wondering whence the James Whale biopic " Gods and Monsters " got its name , we learn .
362720	4888011	405422	10.0	Sex really does sell !	One of the most innovative comedies that I've seen in years , " The 40 Year Old Virgin " rips up everything . Portraying quadragenarian Andy Stitzer ( Steve Carell ) trying to have sex for the first time , it really gives you an " oh no . . . oh yes " feeling watching the movie . I had some favorite scenes , but I probably can't repeat them here . One thing that was really interesting about the movie is that I think that Andy is supposed to have Asperger's Syndrome ( which would impair his ability to start up relationships with women ) . But believe you me , they did a really funny job showing that ! Anyway , it's a great movie . There isn't a dull moment anywhere in it . Also starring Catherine Keener , who shows herself to definitely be one of the best actresses of our time ( especially considering that last year , she also starred in " Capote " ) . You gotta admit , the recent slew of comedies ( this one plus any movie starring Jim Carrey , Jack Black , Ben Stiller , Owen Wilson , Vince Vaughn and / or Will Ferrell ) is really something else !
365685	4888011	77838	10.0	that era may be gone , but the music never will be	The Band plays its final concert in Martin Scorsese's documentary " The Last Waltz " , recorded in San Francisco . Aside from getting to hear the Band and numerous other great performers ( Bob Dylan , Joni Mitchell , Ringo Starr and Neil Young , to name a few ) , the documentary is also a look back at an era gone by . Among other things , the layered hairdos that they have look a lot better than the spiked hair that we see nowadays . It just goes to show that even if that specific era has passed , the music will never die . This documentary is nostalgia in its best form . May the Band's work be remembered forever ! I recommend " The Last Waltz " to everyone .
363391	4888011	52390	10.0	mine hero	Yet again , Wile E . Coyote ( insert scientific name involving eating ) sets a series of traps to get Road Runner ( insert scientific name involving speed ) , but always gets himself . Probably the coolest one here is a tornado seed . Sure enough , he gets sucked in . . . and then there's a mine field ! And the guy still doesn't give up ! True , even before " Whoa , Be-Gone ! " starts , you know what sorts of things are going to happen , but it's still a hoot . After all , WEC always gets his just desserts for trying to harm RR ( another one of the tricks involves a trampoline ) . It's truly a classic . Available on Volume 2 Disc 2 of the Looney Tunes DVDs .
365299	4888011	364725	10.0	There was an article about Joel David Moore in The Oregonian two days ago .	" Dodgeball : A True Underdog Story " is just plain old goof-ball-ism , and it doesn't pretend to be anything else . It has the Average Joes gym going up against Globo Gym in a tournament . The Average Joes gym is clearly a working class gym , while Globo Gym's slogan is " We're better than you , and we know it ! " Maybe for the most part , this is a recycled triumph of the underdog story - where against all odds the ragtag team defeats the big guys with all the money - but the performances carry it to excellence . Ben Stiller , as Globo Gym owner White Goodman , makes a really funny slime-ball . Vince Vaughn , as Average Joes gym owner Peter La Fleur , creates a very commendable character . Christine Taylor , as reporter Kate Veatch , is what a reporter should be . Rip Torn , as trainer Patches O'Houlihan , is one acerbic SOB ( Hank Azaria plays his younger self ) . And I now realize that Fran Stalinofskivich ( from Ramanovia ) was played by Missi Pyle , who also starred in " Bringing Down the House " and " Charlie and the Chocolate Factory " . Oh yeah , and about that article . Joel David Moore is here in his native Portland shooting the indie flick " Spiral " with Amber Tamblyn ( of TV's " Joan of Arcadia " ) .
363559	4888011	17925	10.0	train he rides	If " The General " is Buster Keaton's best known movie , I can see why . An explosion of wackiness with some human emotion here and there , it goes to show why Keaton was such a great comedian . It's always great to see him with a deadpan expression - and even a mop-top hairdo ! - despite the craziness surrounding him while driving the train . But amidst it all , we understand that he has a solid , perfectly good reason for taking the locomotive down the railroad . Of course , even if he didn't it would still be a great movie . It's one that you just gotta love . They must have had fun filming it . And the best part ( for me , at least ) is : they filmed it here in Oregon !
362756	4888011	60424	10.0	Lemmon and Matthau debut as a team	In this , the first movie starring Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau as a comedy team , reporter Lemmon gets injured at a football game , leading his lawyer friend Matthau to seek a massive settlement ( that is , if Lemmon can pretend to be badly injured for a long time ) . Like other movies of the era - such as " It's a Mad , Mad , Mad , Mad World " and " Who's Minding the Mint ? " - " The Fortune Cookie " shows how greed can send seemingly ordinary people absolutely nuts . I liked how they did the movie like chapters in a book ; a very clever device indeed . And who else but Billy Wilder could do it ? But above all , this was a sign of things to come , as JL and WM would co-star in another ten movies after this . All in all , we're very fortunate that " The Fortune Cookie " exists . Watch for a young Noam Pitlik as the man across the street .
363805	4888011	78346	10.0	And then , Christopher Reeve became even more of a superhero in real life .	Obviously , everyone knows Superman , so I'll talk about a few aspects . It was sort of a shock to everyone when Christopher Reeve got paralyzed , seeing as to how we associated him with the man of steel . But his tireless crusade for people with spinal cord injuries showed him to be a sort of superhero in his own right . As Superman's father Jor-El , Marlon Brando seems subdued , but still shows why he was one of the greatest actors of all time ( as it was , he and Reeve died within four months of each other ) . As villain Lex Luthor , Gene Hackman makes a really interesting character : vile , but kinda cool , he's the bad guy who we all want to be deep down . Margot Kidder also has a great role as the title character's self-standing hubby Lois Lane , and Ned Beatty is really funny as Luthor's goofy sidekick Otis . Also starring is Marc McClure as Jimmy Olson . I remember a " Saturday Night Live " episode where they imagine what would have happened had Superman been raised in Germany : they conclude that the man of steel - played by Dan Aykroyd in that skit - would have joined the Nazis and been called Ubermann . As it was , Friedrich Nietzsche theorized an " Ubermensch " . All in all , " Superman " is an inimitable superhero flick . I agree with a previous reviewer that " Batman " and " Spiderman " owe a lot to this movie . Truly great .
364180	4888011	104797	10.0	Spike Lee's best movie ever	Reaching his apex of greatness , Spike Lee created a perfect biography of the Black Nationalist leader . In the title role , Denzel Washington literally becomes the character . From the opening , when he accurately accuses the white man of all the injustices that the white man has perpetrated , to his conversion to Islam ( and rejection of his slave surname ) , to his eventual assassination , the movie is top-notch in every respect . Having read Malcolm X's autobiography , I can affirm that the movie followed it very closely . Reading his autobiography will actually help you understand him even further . As will his indication that African-Americans bled for the white man in Korea , Japan , Italy , etc . , so why shouldn't they bleed for their freedom at home ? Anyway , " Malcolm X " is a perfect movie in every way .
363453	4888011	79180	10.0	Oy gevalt , Gene Wilder wasn't meshugga to take this role !	Sort of playing off of his presence in " Blazing Saddles " , Gene Wilder plays rabbi Avram Belinski , who leaves his seminary in 1850 Poland to marry a woman in San Francisco and start a synagogue there . But naturally , the American West holds more than a few surprises for him , namely train robber Tommy Lillard ( Harrison Ford ) . " The Frisco Kid " may not be the most famous movie , but it certainly has its merits . Wilder and Ford are quite a pairing , and the movie never drags . I think that I did once hear that some of the first cowboys may have been Jewish , but that's just a possibility . The point is that you're sure to like this movie .
363779	4888011	71562	10.0	an equal sequel	Everyone has probably heard that " The Godfather : Part II " is as good as the original , and it's true . Perhaps it's better , that's debatable . Picking up where the first film left off , we see the Corleones ' control over Las Vegas . Also , Michael ( Al Pacino ) gets involved with Hyman Roth ( Lee Strasberg ) , one of his father's former cohorts . Meanwhile , in flashbacks , we see young Vito Andolini immigrate from the town of Corleone , Sicily , to New York City in the early 20th century . As he ages ( the adult Vito is played by Robert DeNiro ) , Vito becomes increasingly involved in Mafia business . The climax ( at least in my opinion , it was the climax ) happens in Cuba on New Year's Eve in 1958 . You may recall that the Mafia helped prop up Fulgencio Batista and his reign of terror . Anyway , while Michael and Fredo ( John Cazale ) are at a party at the Presidential Palace , Michael angrily yells at Fredo " I know it was you , Fredo ! You broke my heart ! " At that moment , just as it turns into 1959 , the revolutionary forces enter Havana , proclaiming the revolution's victory . The combination of these two events shows that things won't be the same anymore , whether in the Corleone family or in Cuba . To be certain , Kay ( Diane Keaton ) has some unexpected news for Michael when he returns home . The point is , this movie disproves the notion that all sequels suck . This sequel is a masterpiece , with splendid performances by Pacino , Keaton , DeNiro , Cazale , Strasberg , Robert Duvall and Talia Shire . But of course , most of all , this movie's superbness owes to director Francis Ford Coppola . He knows exactly how to make a movie , and don't let anyone tell you otherwise . .
363378	4888011	44706	10.0	now this is what I call a western	It has been noted many times that " High Noon " was an allegory for people refusing to stand up to the McCarthy-era blacklist . And a masterpiece at that . Happening circa 1880 , Sheriff Will Kane ( Gary Cooper ) of Hadleyville , New Mexico , has just gotten married to Quaker Amy Fowler ( Grace Kelly ) and is retiring from law enforcement . Unfortunately , he receives news that a criminal whom he sent to jail has been released and will arrive in town at noon . Kane tries to enlist help to fight the criminals , but the townspeople are too cowardly to help out , forcing Kane into the showdown of his life . The movie is a masterpiece from any angle , but the haunting theme song ( " Do Not Forsake Me , Oh My Darlin ' " ) adds to the mood . Cooper won a well deserved Oscar for his role , and this in fact was probably the best performance for all involved . Everyone should definitely see " High Noon " . It may help us one day .
365249	4888011	465551	10.0	the title sounds a little bit like " Snakes on a Plane "	I expect Judi Dench and Cate Blanchett to play very good roles , but I couldn't have predicted the intensity of " Notes on a Scandal " . Portraying school official Barbara ( Dench ) discovering teacher Sheba ( Blanchett ) having an affair with a student and using it against her , the whole thing keeps you on the edge of your seat . Far from the kindly , aristocratic roles with which she's most associated , Dench creates a cold , vicious character . And yet , seeing the actions of both women , you can't really sympathize with either one . Not surprisingly , it all leads to some pretty ugly consequences . Anyway , don't start this movie expecting either woman to play the sort of roles in which you've seen them before . They both come across as kind of vile , even if they have good qualities . And they both do a great job with it . Judi Dench certainly deserved her Oscar nomination ( although I'm glad that they gave Helen Mirren the award ) . Also starring Bill Nighy . And yes , I thought that the title sounded a little bit like " Snakes on a Plane " . Just imagine Judi Dench saying something like " I've had it with these motherking notes on this motherking scandal ! "
365469	4888011	71315	10.0	murkier and murkier	In case anyone thought that detective movies died when Humphrey Bogart did , " Chinatown " disproves that . Los Angeles Det . Jake Gittes ( Jack Nicholson ) is assigned to investigate millionaire Hollis Mulwray , but events lead him to a world of corruption and sleaze . Not only is Hollis ' wife Evelyn ( Faye Dunaway ) a major player , but Jake might not be as safe as he thinks . Everyone has probably heard of the famous scene where director Roman Polanski . . . well , in case you haven't seen it , I'll let you find out . But the point is , it doesn't even suffice to call " Chinatown " a detective movie ; it shows every nasty aspect of life that no one likes to imagine . You don't even know the definition of the word " gritty " until you've seen this movie .
363288	4888011	86450	10.0	the only one that I know	I know that this was a remake of a 1942 Ernst Lubitsch movie , but I've never seen the Lubitsch version . So , the Mel Brooks version of " To Be or Not to Be " is the one that I know . And I really like it . Just as he did in " The Producers " , Mel makes the audience laugh hysterically at the Nazis ( also accomplished by Charlie Chaplin and Roberto Benigni ) . Like many movies , it goes to show that humor really is the best way to deal with political issues . . . and also that Mel didn't have to be completely silly to come up with great ideas . Too bad that Mel Brooks and Anne Bancroft didn't co-star more often , as they were definitely a cool team here . You're sure to love it . And just remember what to do the next time that you have to deal with chronic invaders . . . Also starring Tim Matheson , Charles Durning , Christopher Lloyd and Estelle Reiner .
363937	4888011	120857	10.0	Cher's last stand	Another masterpiece from Franco Zefferelli ( also the man behind " Romeo and Juliet " ) , " Tea with Mussolini " portrays several English and American expatriate women raising an Italian boy in 1930's Florence . Always ready to reject authority , these women know how to live . It's another great tale of civil disobedience at a time when it seemed impossible if not dangerous . Cher , Judi Dench , Maggie Smith , Joan Plowright , and Lily Tomlin all do great jobs with the roles . It's weird to imagine Cher in such a role ; I've always thought that she was kind of worthless . But even she does really well here . A splendid movie for all times . Definitely see it .
362970	4888011	71141	10.0	Germany having to come to grips with it's past .	Rainer Werner Fassbinder may have been post-war Germany's greatest director , and " Fear Eats the Soul " is one of the many movies that shows it . Emmi Kurowski ( Brigitte Mira ) is a middle-aged woman who falls for young Arab immigrant Ali ( El Hedi ben Salem ) , to the dismay of her friends and relatives . Emmi and Ali try to live their lives normally , while doing everything possible to fight off verbal attacks . I guess that in Germany they felt sort of an obligation to make these kinds of movies , given their past . Of course , virtually every Western power ( including the United States ) has had such a past . But either way , " Fear Eats the Soul " is a truly great movie .
364093	4888011	71129	10.0	Fellini always had something to offer	Most of Federico Fellini's movies were deliberately bizarre , but " Amarcord " is toned down slightly . That doesn't mean that it's not good . On the contrary , it's another masterpiece . In this case , he focuses on a small town in 1930s Italy , as seen from the eyes of a teenage boy . It's a world of Mussolini's fascism , and a movie theater full of many classic movies . A particularly interesting scene has them burning " the witch " , and there's a little bit of a mishap ( or maybe it wasn't a mishap ) . Anyway , " Amarcord " is another great movie from the man who may have been Italy's greatest director in history . A true classic .
365709	4888011	86374	10.0	With " American Graffiti " ' s drag racer , " Carrie " ' s creep , Christina Crawford , a certain character actor , and Nurse Ratched , just guess .	It's " Back to the Future " meets " Invasion of the Body Snatchers " when a woman goes to her hometown in the Midwest but doesn't return . Her husband ( Paul LeMat ) goes there and discovers that aliens took it over 25 years earlier with the government's complicity ! To complicate things just a little further , we find out that " Men in Black " was right : the tabloids DO tell the truth ( in this case , there's an article about a town getting taken over by aliens ) ! It's just neat seeing that when he goes there , everything still looks like the 1950s , and then no one believes him . But overall , how they develop the story is pretty interesting . Louise Fletcher seems to be channeling Nurse Ratched as the government bureaucrat trying to keep the alien takeover under wraps , and Nancy Allen plays her usual kind of role as the tabloid reporter who wrote about the alien takeover . But really neat is Michael Lerner as a man whose family got abducted by the aliens many years earlier . Anyway , " Strange Invaders " shows that alien invasion movies can be really cool , especially since the aliens took on human form . You're sure to like it . Also starring Wallace Shawn and Charles Lane ( who's now 101 years old and still going ) .
364694	4888011	70707	10.0	Would you imagine a sci-fi movie starring Woody Allen ?	In one of his coolest movies , Woody Allen plays Miles Monroe , who got cryogenically frozen in the 20th century , only to get brought back to life two hundred years later . The plot actually involves an organization trying to overthrow the government , but the movie is mostly an excuse to be zany . And I don't just mean the Orgasmatron . They've also discovered that smoking is very healthy . And that whole sequence with him pretending to be a robot is a classic . Above all , " Sleeper " shows that Allen does best when not focusing on neurotic rich New Yorkers . How he comes up with this stuff I'll never guess , but he does it . A hoot .
364527	4888011	51825	10.0	Rabbits of a round table .	We all know King Arthur , but what if Bugs Bunny was his court jester ? Quite simply , the king - disappointed at his knights chickening out ( in more way than one ) - would send Bugs to fetch the Singing Sword kept by the Black Knight , aka Yosemite Sam . And that's just what happens in " Knighty Knight Bugs " . Specifically , when Bugs finds the Singing Sword , it literally starts singing , and Sam comes after him with his pet dragon . But Bugs tricks them and takes over the castle , leading Sam to pull several embarrassing stunts attempting to re-enter . I really liked Sam's plan to " sail over the wall " . All in all , they created another classic cartoon here .
363707	4888011	343737	10.0	Welcome to the CI	For years , I had read about the CIA's dirty tricks , but it never totally clicked in my mind what sort of people must work there . Robert DeNiro's " The Good Shepherd " shows what kind of people , and the movie does a masterful job at it . We start in April , 1961 , when the US is launching an the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba . When the whole operation fails , agent Edward Wilson ( Matt Damon ) heads to the CIA headquarters to help investigate . From there , we see his life story . They begin with 1939 Yale , and his initiation into Skull and Bones ( hmm , now who does that sound like ? ) . While we see that it's a vile , disgusting society , it can't begin to prepare Edward for the intrigue in which he's about to get involved . This includes discrediting his literature teacher ( Michael Gambon ) . Despite his shotgun marriage to senator's daughter Clover Russell ( Angelina Jolie ) , he immediately has to go to England to help them fight Germany . But when the war ends and tensions between the United States and Soviet Union arise , he sees it as his duty to help spy on the USSR . Moreover , Gen . Bill Sullivan ( DeNiro ) proposes a new agency to replace the Overseas Secret Service . So , the founding of the CIA in 1947 lays the ground work for sixty years of evil activity all in the name of national security . But one of the ugliest things that the movie shows is Edward's relationship - or lack thereof - with his family . Practically ignoring his wife and son , he always comes across as totally soulless ; then again , you have to be pretty soulless to work for the CIA . And in case it looks as though his son may have spilled a few secrets to a woman in the Congo . . . well , Edward has no limits . And his co-workers have no scruples about spying on him . All in all , this is surely one of the best movies of 2006 . Watching it , you may start looking around you , nervous about the people in your vicinity . It's that intense . When I first heard about what the movie portrayed , I got the feeling that it may have been loosely based on George H . W . Bush , although I then learned that he was never actually an agent . But overall , I definitely recommend this one . Also starring William Hurt , Billy Crudup , Alec Baldwin , Hanna Schygulla , Keir Dullea and Joe Pesci ( where have those last two been ? ) .
364654	4888011	105793	10.0	I learned how to spell a certain body part by watching this movie . . . and I still remember the ad shown before " The Addams Family "	As Mike Myers is now best known as Austin Powers , it's easy to forget that he started out as Aurora , Illinois , goof-ball Wayne Campbell . " Wayne's World " is just as funny today as it was back in 1992 . I'd never seen the " Saturday Night Live " skit before the movie came out , but that didn't hurt anything ; the movie is a hoot whether or not you've seen the " SNL " skit . As for the other characters , Garth Algar ( Dana Carvey ) is my favorite . How he comes up with some of those things I'll never know . Maybe Cassandra ( Tia Carrere ) and Benjamin ( Rob Lowe ) weren't totally necessary , but even they had their moments . But the best scene is definitely when they're filming and Wayne is reading the questions off of the cards ; it's quite possible that you'll die laughing when that scene comes up . But the point is , this flick is a modern comedy classic . I still remember how everyone in school went around saying " Not ! " after it came out . I also remember when my parents and I went to see " The Addams Family " in the theater and there was an ad featuring Wayne and Garth promoting their own movie . We'll always have to remember these things . . .
363972	4888011	110719	10.0	so much for changes in Russia	One unfortunate reality of post-Soviet Russia was that the people's welfare didn't change much from Soviet times . As we see in " Window to Paris " , most people are still as depressed as ever , while they are encouraged to go after money . Then , everything changes for music teacher Nikolai Chizhov ( Sergei Dontsov ) after he finds a window that leads to Paris . He and his friends are naturally quite amazed at what they find . This movie has one of the funniest discussions of Elvis Presley and Edith Piaf that I've ever heard . So watch this movie . You're sure to love it . It's sort of a precursor to " Being John Malkovich " .
363965	4888011	80319	10.0	for anyone who's ever hated their boss	Ever wanted to take revenge on a really creepy person ? Well , Jane Fonda , Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton do just that in " Nine to Five " . After their undesirable-in-every-way boss ( Dabney Coleman ) threatens to have them arrested after a misunderstanding ( it's a long story ) , the three take him hostage and institute progressive policies in the office . Especially a hoot is the mixture of characters : Jane Fonda is the mousy newcomer , Lily Tomlin is the goof-off , and Dolly Parton is the hillbilly . No matter what happens , they always have a solution , even after a bizarre mix-up in a hospital . I recommend this to everyone .
364539	4888011	41959	10.0	Orson Welles's 3rd great movie	" The Third Man " functions as a sort of half film noir , half look at post-WWII Vienna . The plot centers on Holly Martin ( Joseph Cotten ) learning of his friend's ( Orson Welles ) death in Vienna , meeting various and sundry strange people , and getting a big surprise at the end . Probably the movie's strongest aspect is the zither music . You can feel it moving the film along , almost as much as the mysterious setting does . But when they set up the trick at the end , it's especially neat how they set it up ! Even if you know what's going to happen , you still have to admire what they did . Anyway , it's one of Orson Welles's many great movies , along with " Citizen Kane " and " The Lady from Shanghai " ( I have as yet never seen " Touch of Evil " ) . Definitely check it out . Also starring Alida Valli .
364814	4888011	50449	10.0	Holy mother of . . . ! They said it !	In case you've ever doubted just how in-your-face the Looney Tunes cartoons were , just check out " Gonzales ' Tamales " . In this one , Speedy Gonzales - who , as you may have noticed from other cartoons , is a total playboy - is seducing the female mice , and making the male mice very angry . So , they get Sylvester to go after him . Needless to say , Speedy knows just how to avoid getting caught . Anyway , the real " gotcha " moment comes towards the end . Speedy was singing " La cucaracha " . Since I knew what the lyrics were , I listened to see if the people making the cartoon would use them . Sure enough , it ends with " marijuana que fumar " ( meaning " marijuana to smoke " ) ! To think that in the midst of the strict McCarthyism world of the 1950s , they sneaked in something about Mary Jane ! Only the Termite Terrace crowd could do that ! Overall , a really funny cartoon .
362840	4888011	120770	10.0	Like " Dude , Where's My Car ? " , it shows that movies can be stupid and funny at the same time .	Just imagine every dopey duo ( e . g . , Bill and Ted ) and imagine them trying to get into a cool club , and you basically have " A Night at the Roxbury " . I had never heard of Will Ferrell before this movie came out , but he did a hilarious job here and has of course seen his career proliferate since . He and Chris Kattan play slacker brothers Steve and Doug Butabi , trying to get into a club . Well , that's the official plot ; but like other such movies , it's basically an excuse for a bunch of crazy situations . I've seen some of the " SNL " episodes that had this skit . My favorite one was the one with Sylvester Stallone . It ended with something that I'm probably not allowed to write here .
363117	4888011	41711	10.0	After hearing Charlie Dog say " shut up " , who wouldn't want to go around saying it ?	Watching " Often an Orphan " , it's surprising that Charlie Dog didn't become a regular Looney Tunes character . In this cartoon , he gets abandoned by his master and starts pestering Porky Pig to adopt him . When Porky refuses , Charlie launches into an emotion-manipulating monologue about the horrors of city life . It later turns out that Charlie is smarter than Porky . So , maybe this wasn't the best Looney Tunes cartoon ever , but it's great just because of how Charlie says " Well then shaddup ! " Only Mel Blanc could create a voice like that . Worth seeing . And I guess that you could say that Porky puts on a few " pounds " at the end .
364806	4888011	72081	10.0	So will Steve Martin be able to equal Peter Sellers ?	The upcoming release of the " Pink Panther " remake brings to mind the original series , including this one . When the famous diamond gets stolen for a second time , Insp . Jacques Clouseau ( Peter Sellers ) gets put on the case , and I shouldn't have to tell you what sorts of things he does , especially since this movie turns him into an even bigger doofus than previously . As Sir Charles Litton , Christopher Plummer does approximately as good a job as David Niven did . But the movie is all about Clouseau . One can only imagine how the people behind the camera must have cracked up watching him do these things . " The Return of the Pink Panther " is a comedy classic . Oh , and there's also that scene in the bedroom ! Hah !
363286	4888011	111112	10.0	many ways to look at Ireland	I have liked every one of John Sayles's movies that I've seen , and " The Secret of Roan Inish " is no exception . The movie mainly focuses on ten-year-old Fiona going to live with her grandparents in Donegal , Ireland , and learning family stories . But there were two aspects that I found particularly important . One was the focus on how England sought to destroy the Irish culture . Students weren't allowed to speak their native language in school , and Fiona's grandparents have to give up their house to an English family . But there was also the focus on seals . Aside from the story about the woman who could turn into a seal , there's Fiona's disappeared younger brother : might the seals be raising him ? Rarely have I ever seen such a mystical and edifying look at the relationship between humans and animals . All in all , this is the sort of movie that could only come from John Sayles . It's about as far from a Hollywood movie as you can get , and I recommend it to everyone . You just might want to take a trip to the Emerald Isle after watching it .
