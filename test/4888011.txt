364237	4888011	174685	1.0	the boots were golden , the plot line was not	This movie doesn't know whether it wants to show go-go dancers and their big breasts , or whether it wants to be about the sleazy world of organized crime . The " plot " centers on a waitress who hitches a ride with some man to LA to become a go-go dancer and gets mixed up with what appears to be the mafia ( especially since the main bad guy has an oily mustache ) . That's about as complex as the whole thing gets . It's one of those movies which is supposed to be easy to follow , but it's so bad that you can't follow it . However , you will be able to follow it if you watch the " MST3K " version . Personally , I think that these sorts of movies would be much more interesting if they would forget about subplots and focus only on the go-go dancers . For that matter , there were more silver boots than gold boots .
363620	4888011	120891	1.0	I'm assuming that the original series wasn't like this .	The only reason to watch the god-awful " Wild Wild West " is to see Kevin Kline as a neat foil to Will Smith . Otherwise , the whole movie's a mess . The " plot " has agents Jim West ( Smith ) and Artemus Gordon ( Kline ) trying to stop nefarious Dr . Arliss Loveless ( Kenneth Branagh ) from dismantling the United States . Yes , this does sound like a potentially great idea , especially given the cast ( which also includes Salma Hayek and M . Emmet Walsh ) . Unfortunately , the whole movie makes you feel like you just got your head banged against a brick wall . There are a few good scenes , but only a few ; the rest of the movie is just a rehash of better movies . Relying way too much on special effects , this movie makes one feel great that 1999 remains best known for movies like " The Blair Witch Project " and " American Beauty " .
364232	4888011	86026	1.0	" Pod People " and " Bio-Dome " are like peas in a pod	They say that no good deed goes unpunished . This movie - or should I say " this swill " - shows that to be 100 % true . Spielberg made " E . T . " and someone made " Los nuevos extraterrestres " ( called " Pod People " in the United States ) in response . The movie has a boy befriending an alien who looks sort of like an anteater , and some weird things result . WHY CAN'T ALIENS KIDNAP THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE THESE KINDS OF MOVIES ? ! There are plenty of good stories out there and they have to go and make this ? ! That said , the movie was not a complete waste . Quite the opposite : " MST3K " once showed it . As you might imagine , Joel , Servo and Crow have lots of fun with it .
364666	4888011	58953	1.0	beach blah blink blank	I think that we can all agree that the beach movies from the mid ' 60s were at the bottom of the cinematic barrel ( " Catalina Caper " even got shown on " Mystery Science Theater 3000 " ) . " Beach Blanket Bingo " is an eye roll-inducing piece of swill about a gaggle of sexually inactive teenagers trying to protect a mermaid from a biker gang . How tragic that they wasted a potentially hilarious plot on something so stupid . If nothing else , couldn't they have waited a few years so that they could have thrown in some sex ? ! I mean , THEY HAD A MERMAID AND THEY COULDN'T DO IT WITH HER ? ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! WHY ? ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! And isn't it more chic to portray biker gangs as cool ? Anyway , the fact that Buster Keaton appears in this just goes to show how far he had gotten reduced . I don't doubt that the two people from " Bewitched " ( director William Asher and co-star Paul Lynde ) probably prefer to be associated with that show and not with this . It's no accident that Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello never became A-list stars ( unless you count his appearance in " Grease " ) . Nowadays , I think that we only know her because she has multiple sclerosis , the same thing that afflicted Richard Pryor . " MST3K " really should have shown this flick ; Mike , Servo and Crow could have made some great comments .
365116	4888011	280209	1.0	My mind would have gotten x'd from the world had this not appeared on " MST3K " .	After a man classified by Mike , Servo and Crow as " Elmer Fudd " makes a long , boring speech , we get treated to a preachy look at the dangers of the road as a guardian angel defends his recently deceased client before a judge who looks like Boris Karloff on depressants . If you just watch " X Marks the Spot " in its original form , you'll wish that a car could run you over . But the " MST3K " version is perfectly enjoyable . When the people who made this drudgery first made it , they probably never imagined that a certain robot would relate it to Mick Jagger . All in all , how cruel of Dr . Forrester to make Mike , Servo and Crow watch this swill .
365125	4888011	155711	2.0	all flaws with practically no redeeming qualities	You know how comedies are supposed to make you laugh ? Well , " Flawless " makes you laugh , but you're not laughing at what happens in the movie ; you're laughing at the fact that the movie didn't come out very good . Certainly the idea of a homophobic cop having to make amends with a drag queen seems like it could make an interesting movie , but they didn't do it here . The whole thing just drags . The movie doesn't even really have any clever lines . Robert DeNiro should have known better than to star in this , and I think that we can all agree that Philip Seymour Hoffman did a much better job playing a gay person in " Capote " . All in all , pathetic .
362958	4888011	119874	3.0	Now that George Clooney has won an Oscar , it's amazing that he once starred in this garbage .	You know how George Clooney is one of the most well regarded actors in Hollywood ? You know , that he just recently won an Oscar for " Syriana " and received a Best Director nomination for " Good Night , and Good Luck . " ? And he went on a fact-finding mission to Darfur ? Well , nine years ago , all this would have seemed unfathomable . In 1997 , Clooney starred in two of the most pathetic movies imaginable . Everyone knows how bad " Batman and Robin " was , but probably not as many people know about " The Peacemaker " . This one casts him as a man out to stop a terrorist from using a loose nuke from Russia . Yes , they could make such a plot into something interesting , but they didn't . Nicole Kidman's character is the ultimate clich√© : she's beautiful and smart , and totally melts in Clooney's presence . It's almost incredible that director Mimi Leder also directed the very good " Deep Impact " . Look , just avoid this worthless movie . George Clooney and Nicole Kidman have both starred in plenty of good movies , so there's no reason to waste your time on this .
365563	4888011	183505	5.0	Oh ack	" Me , Myself & Irene " is the sort of movie at which you die laughing the first time , but after that you're not sure whether you want to laugh . I wouldn't know whether or not it makes fun of mentally unstable people . Basically two hours of Jim Carrey pulling off various and sundry gross stunts as a schizophrenic cop , it's not a bad movie , but not one of his best either ( for gross-out humor with the Farrelly brothers , he reached his peak in " Dumb & Dumber " ) . Renee Zellweger had only recently come into my conscience when I saw this , but she's done better since . All in all , this movie is harmless , but not one that I'd recommend above others .
364403	4888011	120915	5.0	I didn't understand the plot until I heard " Weird " Al Yankovic's song .	OK , so " Star Wars : Episode I - The Phantom Menace " was a big letdown for us all . Apparently , most people even understood the plot when it came out . It wasn't until I listened to " Weird " Al Yankovic's song " The Saga Begins " - the " American Pie " spoof - on his album " Running with Scissors " that I understood the plot . But overall , it seems that if this happens before the original trilogy , then the technology should be less sophisticated , not more . Oh well . C'est la vie . It was interesting seeing people like Liam Neeson , Samuel L . Jackson , and Christopher Lee co-starring in a movie after all these years . This may sound weird to everyone , but my favorite character was Jar Jar Binks ; why did everyone think that he sounded Jamaican ? I thought that he sounded Cajun . So that's my take on everything here .
363824	4888011	59786	5.0	Mamie Eisenhower joins the ACLU	I wish to say that " Teen-Age Strangler " was slightly better than most of the movies shown on " Mystery Science Theater 3000 " , just because of that song " Yipe Stripes " ; you gotta admit , it was a cool song . But other than that , every scene with the sniveling younger brother drags the movie down ; I mean , what was that guy's problem ? ! So , as a mildly different take on the leather jacket genre , it deserves to get seen on " MST3K " to get the optimal experience . Aside from Mamie Eisenhower , other famous people cited by Mike ( or was it Joel ? ) and the ' bots are Vivian Vance and Danny Thomas . And I will say that some of those girls are quite hot !
363016	4888011	97757	5.0	" Rethinking Columbus " offered some good insight	In 1992 , when most of the country was celebrating the quincentenary of Columbus landing in the Americas , the educational organization Rethinking Schools published a study guide called " Rethinking Columbus " , looking at the real effects that his legacy had . One of the things that it mentioned was portrayals of certain groups in popular media , and it mentioned Disney movies , including " The Little Mermaid " . The three women in the movie are Ariel , Ursula and the maid . One exists only to be beautiful , one exists only to be evil , and the other exists only to get chores done . In short , not good role models for little girls . I guess that as long as we understand that , the movie is probably OK . I actually think that it sounds funny that religious wackos have found what they claim are sexual perversions in the movie . What's really interesting is when one sees the cast : Rene Auberjonois , Nancy Cartwright , Gerrit Graham , Buddy Hackett , Mark Hamill , Kenneth Mars and Edie McClurg . To rephrase that : the " MASH " priest , Bart Simpson , a cult flick star , Benji from " It's a Mad , Mad , Mad , Mad World " , Luke Skywalker , the " Young Frankenstein " cop , and the woman who got cursed at by Steve Martin in " Planes , Trains and Automobiles " . Whoa .
364053	4888011	80731	5.0	Fu fighter	Although the thought of a white person playing an Asian sort of makes us cringe , I wouldn't call Peter Sellers's final film ( also David Tomlinson's final film ) awful . Granted , this was probably less than they would have wanted to end with . But Sellers brings a certain charm to the double role of the 168-year-old titular character , trying to carry out a heist in 1930s England , and a British police officer hired to look for him . Admittedly , " The Fiendish Plot of Dr . Fu Manchu " isn't any kind of masterpiece . It's kind of choppy and drags at times . But there are some funny scenes , and Sid Caesar's character has a name that makes you think " Uh-oh " . I guess that at most , it's a way to pass time . Pretty much all the cast members have done much better than this . But it does elicit a few laughs . Also starring Helen Mirren , and even Burt Kwouk ( better known as Cato in the " Pink Panther " movies ) in a small role .
365149	4888011	52611	6.0	and other gigantic things	There were so many movies about radioactive fallout turning ordinary animals into skulking monsters that it sometimes gets hard to remember which is which . " Behemoth , the Sea Monster " is passable . True , it's hokey ( particularly the early scene where the guy says what killed him ) and nothing that we haven't seen before , but it's pretty fun to watch . Personally , I'd like to see a movie where a human gets turned into a giant and goes to the ocean floor , thereby wreaking havoc on everything ( which would be more realistic ) . So anyway , this flick's mostly a way to pass time . The big guy is a pretty neat monster .
364173	4888011	52646	6.0	Was the monster that guy in the Diane Arbus photo ?	We might call " The Brain That Wouldn't Die " a B-movie , but it actually wasn't too bad . Granted , the concept was pretty outlandish , but the movie is worth seeing ( if only for sci-fi fetishists ) . The plot of course has Dr . Bill Cortner ( Herb Evers ) keeping lover Jan Compton's ( Virginia Leith ) decapitated head alive . The head befriends a monster ( Eddie Carmel ) in the closet . Sound far-fetched ? It is , but the movie's pretty cool . And I remember that Diane Arbus titled one of her photos " Jewish Giant Visiting His Parents in Brooklyn " , and I think that it was Eddie Carmel in that photo . The things that we see in life . . .
364311	4888011	43265	6.0	a queen of a movie	Okay , so I admit that " The African Queen " is pure escapism , but you gotta love it . Katharine Hepburn plays Rose Sayer , a prim and proper missionary in German East Africa with her brother ( Robert Morley ) in 1914 . Suddenly , right after they receive news that war has broken out in Europe , the German army comes in and demolishes their settlement . After the brother dies , hard-drinking stubbly sailor Charlie Allnut ( Humphrey Bogart ) comes in and agrees to take Rose down the river . Along the way , they bicker about various things ( she's disgusted by his drinking , he finds her too pious ) , but they grow to respect each other . Bogart and Hepburn pretty much play their usual roles , and the movie also stars a few crocodiles ( most of the movie was filmed on location in Africa ) . The portrayal of the German army certainly seems to be an allusion to the Nazis . But overall , the movie is quite admirable , with Rose's and Charlie's personalities bouncing off of each other . It's like an early buddy comedy , even though it's serious .
365704	4888011	382077	6.0	keep the ending ( and for that matter , the whole plot ) hidden	" Hide and Seek " is one of those movies where you can only enjoy it if you know absolutely nothing about it ahead of time . I couldn't have predicted what would happen . David Callaway ( Robert DeNiro ) and his daughter Emily ( Dakota Fanning ) move to a small town after his wife Allison ( Amy Irving ) commits suicide . But when David and Emily move into their new house , strange things begin to happen , all of which apparently relate to Emily's imaginary friend Charlie . Okay , so the people - move - into - house - and - abnormal - occurrences - follow idea has been used more times than anyone can count , but the performances keep this movie afloat . DeNiro naturally does a good job , as do Famke Janssen and Elisabeth Shue . And Fanning , despite her " cute " reputation , actually looks pretty creepy . So come out , come out , wherever you are , and see what you think of " Hide and Seek " .
364677	4888011	43008	6.0	Beaky needs some SERIOUS counseling	Braindead avian Beaky Buzzard debuted in Bob Clampett's " Bugs Bunny Gets the Boid " in 1942 . Clampett brought him back in " The Bashful Buzzard " in 1945 . After a five year absence , Beaky reappeared in " The Lion's Busy " and " Strife with Father " , after which he never appeared in another theatrical short . This one portrays Beaky getting left at the doorstep of husband and wife owls Monte and Gwendlyn . They try to raise him to be a gentleman , but . . . well , let's just say that Beaky belongs with his own kind ! Long story short , never try to integrate a loopy oaf into decent society . Maybe Beaky should see a shrink . It's hard to say what I really think of Beaky Buzzard . He proved to be an interesting character in his few appearances . I don't know whether or not his shtick would have gotten tiresome had he starred in more cartoons . I guess that just his four roles created enough of a personality to last , even if he is only a second-tier character . This one's worth seeing , if only once . Included as an extra feature on the " Flame and the Arrow " DVD , so I wonder if it preceded that movie in the theater .
365134	4888011	60244	6.0	suddenly , RR gets kind of mean and senses danger	In the mid to late ' 60s , Warner Bros . animation was slowly but surely coming to a close . " Clippety Clobbered " is a prime example , as Wile E . Coyote receives in the mail a non-Acme product to help him catch Road Runner . Naturally , this one fails , as do his subsequent attempts . However , I notice something different about this cartoon . Whereas in most of the WEC-RR pairings , RR usually doesn't even seem to notice that WEC exists , here he does . In fact , RR plays some rather cruel tricks on WEC , and even runs away at the sight of WEC ( does he finally realize the potential danger ? ) . So , it's an OK cartoon , but the formula was pretty much spent by this point , so nothing looks particularly new .
365615	4888011	131369	6.0	" ed " iting the world for " tv "	In a way , it was sort strange that less than a year after " The Truman Show " came out , there was another movie about a man's life getting broadcast on TV . Moreover , it seemed like whereas " TTS " was more of a biting satire , " Edtv " was going soft - maybe trying to be cute - with cameras following a video store clerk ( Matthew McConaughey ) . However , years of reality shows have shown just how disgusting TV can get . And these two movies predicted it . Although I do prefer the former , the latter actually seems to be portraying what we now know as reality shows . So , I will say that this movie doesn't do as good a job as " The Truman Show " , it does have some funny scenes . I actually thought that Ellen Degeneres and Rob Reiner were the two best cast members . OK seeing once ; Ron Howard has done better . Also starring Woody Harrelson , Elizabeth Hurley , Jenna Elfman , Sally Kirkland , Martin Landau , Dennis Hopper and Clint Howard .
363276	4888011	86190	6.0	At this point , it was starting to get gimmicky .	" Star Wars " was without a doubt a masterpiece , " The Empire Strikes Back " was still good but one has to wonder why they continued the story , and " Return of the Jedi " was sort of gimmicky . Granted , it's good that they wanted to show how everything would turn out , but it almost seemed more like a video game . The Ewoks were funny , but not much else . And why did they dress Carrie Fisher like they did early in the movie ? Oh well . Life goes on . Now that we've had episodes 1-3 , we see where this all originated . Or to put it in Yoda talk : where this all originated we seen have . Worth seeing , but don't interpret it as a masterpiece .
363012	4888011	97613	6.0	Happy 60th , Susan !	Since today is ( well yesterday was ) Susan Sarandon's 60th birthday , I saw fit to review one of her lesser known movies ( actually , it's Kevin Kline's movie ) . " January Man " is not a movie that I really know how to describe . Kevin Kline plays Nick Starkey , an ex-cop who gets drug back into the force to help find a serial killer . It's certainly a common plot . This one toes the line between thriller and love story ; I guess that neither is supposed to dominate . I would say that the movie's main strength lies in the various kinds of characters portrayed . Aside from Kline's ex-cop and Sarandon as his wife , there's the new love interest ( Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio ) , Nick's brother ( Harvey Keitel ) , the tough captain ( Danny Aiello ) , and the old-order mayor ( Rod Steiger ) ; Alan Rickman also stars . So , did I think that this was a good movie ? I don't know what it really was . An interesting group of people with an anticlimactic ending , more than anything . I suppose that the movie's worth seeing , if only once .
364831	4888011	59252	6.0	to make your brain swim	No doubt the fact that there were two movies about Jean Harlow in 1965 might surprise some people ; to add to that , apparently neither Carroll Baker nor Carol Lynley was the right woman to play her ( I have to admit that I've never seen any of Jean Harlow's movies - unless you count her appearance in " City Lights " - so I can't comment one way or the other ) . Either way , this " Harlow " seems to go in two directions . On the one hand , it shows how the Hollywood dream looked : the opening scene shows what many people coming to Tinseltown expected , and then Jean Harlow gets to live that dream . . . at least superficially . On the other hand , the portrayals of Harlow's public life and private life make it nearly impossible to determine which is to be best remembered . Here , her frustration with her mother ( Angela Lansbury ) and anger at her stepfather ( Raf Vallone ) get played to almost comic effect . Is every movie star doomed to have something in his / her personal life that has to get sensationalized in a biopic ? So , I would say that this movie takes the same approach to its subject that " Mommie Dearest " did : trashy , but something about the movie gives it an almost desirable feeling . Did I like the movie or hate it ? Well , it has its visuals ( I would call Carroll Baker a visual in and of herself ) , and it sure beats any Steven Seagal movie for smarts . In a way , that's about it . Since I don't really know much about Jean Harlow , I just have to accept what " Harlow " says . It's not outright worthless , but don't make it your first choice . Also starring Red Buttons , Martin Balsam and Leslie Nielsen .
362809	4888011	189071	6.0	Harmless , if nothing else	The whole thing's pretty simple : Scooby-Doo , Scrappy and Shaggy go to be gym instructors in a girl's school . What they don't know is that in this particular school , the students are all monsters ( don't worry - they're good monsters ) . There's a werewolf , a vampire , a ghost , a Frankenstein and a mummy . To crown everything , the headmistress ( who's also the mummy's mother ) has a pet dragon who prefers to breathe fire at Scooby-Doo . Then , while they're all out on an excursion to a swamp , an evil witch kidnaps the girls , and Scooby , Scrappy , Shaggy and the pet dragon have to go save them . . . if they can . I don't think that I've seen most of the Scooby-Doo cartoons - and I deliberately avoided the 2002 movie - but " Scooby-Doo and the Ghoul School " wasn't bad . It's really something now that I realize that " Mary Poppins " matriarch Glynis Johns did the voice of headmistress Ms . Grimwood .
362894	4888011	59125	6.0	So that's Donald Sutherland . . .	Hammer Films just kept ' em coming in the ' 50s and ' 60s . If Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing were involved , then you could safely assume that they had something neat in store . In " Dr . Terror's House of Horrors " , enigmatic Dr . Sandor Schreck ( Peter Cushing ) is in a train with five other men . He proceeds to tell them their fortunes . There's nothing particularly scary here , but it's never pretentious either . This movie is what most of these movies were : nice , silly fun . A standout in the movie is a very young Donald Sutherland as one of the men ; I guess that it's sort of a before-they-were-famous situation for him . And finally , there's a delicious surprise at the end .
364373	4888011	43943	7.0	snow excuse for such rivalry	I wonder why Sylvester doesn't just give up on trying to get Tweety . Clearly that bird has a bad-ass streak . But Sylvester keeps going after him , and in " Putty Tat Trouble " has to vie with an unidentified orange tabby around Christmas . Needless to say , their attempts have rather detrimental results ( to them , that is ) . I agree with a previous reviewer that Sylvester and the other cat could have just made a deal to divide up Tweety equally . But it appears that they're both really greedy ( these toons have a real problem with that , don't they ? ) . And anyway , their misfortunes are their own fault for trying to harm someone else . So , it's not the best Sylvester-Tweety cartoon , but still worth seeing .
364676	4888011	427392	7.0	Remember : you're next !	Normally , I wouldn't support the idea of remaking " The Invasion of the Body Snatchers " ( although it's apparently been done a few times ) ; I consider the original one with Kevin McCarthy almost sacrosanct . But this new version - despite being mostly predictable - brings up an interesting point : what if a virus turning the human race into cold , insensitive beings ended up solving so many of the problems that we see ? What results from the infection's overtaking of humanity looks like ultra-idealism , what with ending all wars and stuff . But would we want to lose what makes us human ? Then again , I can't guarantee that the people behind the movie intended for that sort of interpretation . After all , many people interpreted the original version as either an anti-communist screed or an anti-McCarthyism screed , while the director apparently intended it as a plain old alien invasion story . Overall , this one's worth seeing , if only once . Starring Nicole Kidman ( looking very much like Grace Kelly ) , Daniel Craig , Jeffrey Wright ( the CIA agent in " Syriana " ) , Josef Sommer ( Harrison Ford's boss in " Witness " ) and Veronica Cartwright .
362860	4888011	34977	7.0	chairman of the billboard	Sort of an updated version of " Billboard Frolics " , Friz Freleng's eye-popping " Lights Fantastic " depicts a bunch of billboards - apparently around Times Square - putting on various skits . This cartoon really shows off Freleng's penchant for synchronizing music and action ( especially with the conga beat ) . Freleng also made ample use of this in " Pigs in a Polka " and " Show Biz Bugs " . Mostly this was a place holder in 1942 . By that point , Bugs Bunny was the undisputed Warner Bros . cartoon star , Chuck Jones had totally eschewed cuteness in favor of slapstick , and the United States ' entry into WWII prompted a series of cartoons portraying the characters battling Nazis . But this was certainly a good place holder . Very similar to " Billboard Frolics " , true , but I recommend it .
365023	4888011	147953	7.0	Why can't Snafu ever do anything right ?	In one of the many Pvt . Snafu training films , Snafu tries to camouflage himself , but the Nazis are always one step ahead of him . I guess that these shorts had as their purpose to show American soldiers what not to do in wartime . As we can expect , the cartoon portrays an Americanized version of the German language ( " Mein Herr , haben Sie einen light ? " ) . I guess that as long as we understand what the cartoon portrays , it's easy to enjoy ( as were pretty much all the Pvt . Snafu cartoons ) . And for the record , with those sorts of mermaids , I would have been only to happy to jump into the scenery ! I know , that last part made me sound like a sexist pig . No need to rub it in .
362934	4888011	365478	7.0	Well , you know Bruce Campbell . . .	Or if you've seen the " Evil Dead " trilogy and / or " Bubba Ho-Tep " , then you should know that his movies are total farces . With " Man with the Screaming Brain " , he goes all out again . In this case , he plays smarmy American businessman William Cole visiting Bulgaria - when do we ever get to see that country ? - when a woman kills him . So , strange scientist Ivan Ivanov ( Stacy Keach ) replaces half of Cole's brain with the brain of a former KGB agent , leaving him acting sort of like Steve Martin in " All of Me " . Yes , the whole movie is pretty much an excuse for pure nonsense . Much of the real humor comes from " Evil Dead " director Sam Raimi's brother Ted as Ivanov's nearly brain-dead assistant Pavel . The two men have a relationship more like Laurel and Hardy or Gilligan and the Skipper . So just understand that this is a totally silly movie , and you won't be a bit disappointed . I liked it , anyway .
365337	4888011	810988	7.0	playing nine pins	I'd never heard of " The Nines " when I started watching it . Now , I'm not sure what to think of it . Portraying three interconnected stories set in Los Angeles - and all starring the same people - it seems to be saying something about happenstance . . . but I don't know for certain . I can't say what the overall gist is supposed to be . But I do think that the movie is worth checking out . Seeing what happens in the middle segment , one gets a sense of just how cutthroat the entertainment world must be ( is it just me , or does nobody focus on that more than the entertainment world ? ) . Anyway , worth seeing , but don't be surprised if it totally blows your mind . Starring Ryan Reynolds , Melissa McCarthy , Hope Davis and Elle Fanning .
363022	4888011	95927	7.0	Happy 60th , Sally !	A few years before Sally Field and Tom Hanks played mother and son in " Forrest Gump " , they played stand-up rivals in the light comedy " Punchline " . I will say that this isn't the funniest movie that I've ever seen , but it's great just for the tension between the performers , some of the stand-up jokes , and for Tom Hanks's definition of the rectum ; you have to agree that his name for it is a lot more descriptive . So , this movie probably won't give you any kind of religious experience , but it's a fun way to pass time . Also starring John Goodman and Damon Wayans . Oh , and in case Sally Field is reading this : Happy 60th birthday ! I'm in Russia right now , and yesterday , I went to Verkhoturye , where they have a convent . As a semi-birthday present to you , I said that the convent housed a flying nun . I know , you don't like that moniker , but I had to do something . Thanks for everything .
363050	4888011	87260	7.0	Jim Carrey eventually found fame and kept it ; plus , I see a tiny link to current events .	In the grand scheme of things , " Finders Keepers " is one of those silly comedies that they cranked out in the ' 80s . This one has a scam artist ( Michael O'Keefe , of " Caddyshack " fame ) accidentally getting mixed up in a wacky larceny case on a train after he has to escape the cops and a roller skate team in 1973 . You see , he thinks that a coffin on board the train holds a man killed in Cambodia , but it actually holds an exorbitant amount of money stolen by a woman believed to have been kidnapped . If that sounds overwhelming , just wait ' til you see what happens on the train ! The point is , this movie makes no pretense about being completely goofy . Probably the main reason that anyone would notice it nowadays is the presence of a pre-fame Jim Carrey as . . . well , I might spoil a major part of the movie if I explain it . But one can see a slight hint of the roles that would later make him famous . Speaking of the present day , there's a link in " FK " : Watergate . Throughout much of the movie , we hear about Pres . Nixon ( Nickerson ? ) , the Watergate investigations , and how Spiro Agnew may not last in his position . Agnew was of course replaced by the recently deceased Gerald Ford . Personally , I believe that Ford doesn't deserve the praise that he's been getting ( what really did he do besides fall down ? ) . But anyway , this is a pretty funny movie . You're sure to like it . Also starring Beverly D'Angelo , Louis Gossett Jr . , Pamela Stephenson , Ed Lauter and Brian Dennehy . Back when Richard Lester was directing The Beatles ' movies , who ever would have guessed that he would direct this flick ?
363662	4888011	43128	7.0	just like Hollywood	Before Hollywood biographies centered on drug abuse and such things , " What's Up Doc ? " portrayed Bugs Bunny telling his life story from childhood - " I knew I was different , and then it hit me : I was a rabbit in a human world . " - up to his career in entertainment . However , it seems like there's a little less in this cartoon than the Looney Tunes cartoons usually showed . But I'd say that it's strength lies in its portrayal of the lack of employment in Hollywood ( which I've heard is actually around 95 % ) , and how it forces individuals into self-degrading work . I always get the feeling that whenever the Termite Terrace crowd made cartoons spoofing Tinseltown , they were probably basing the cartoons on their personal experiences . Maybe I can't prove that , but I just get that feeling . So , it's not the greatest cartoon , but worth seeing . I don't know whether or not you're rooting for me , so now I have to go .
365390	4888011	94631	7.0	interesting allegory	" Alien Nation " portrays the future , when aliens have come to the Earth and become the second class citizens , so to speak . Then , human Det . Sgt . Matthew Sykes ( James Caan ) and alien Samuel " George " Francisco ( Mandy Patinkin ) have to join up to stop alien William Harcourt ( Terence Stamp ) from taking over . Much of the movie seems kind of silly ( namely Sykes ' one-liners ) , but they know how to pull it off without letting the movie get ridiculous . I think that my favorite part was when Sykes and Francisco learn what each other's names mean . The movie is a little strange , but definitely worth seeing . You might say that the aliens replace African-Americans as second class citizens .
363938	4888011	209163	7.0	You kids have it easy . You only have to kill the mummy twice . Back in my day , we had to kill him thrice .	Mostly a rehash of the original , but this time , there's the Scorpion King ( The Rock ) to shake things up a bit . I actually saw this movie in Spain , so the one-liners were often hard to translate . But overall , we now know that movies from the 1930's are to be remade in the 1950's-1970's with a sense of camp , and then remade in the 21st century as crosses between David Lean-style epics and Harrison Ford action flicks ; not only " The Mummy " , but also " King Kong " comes to mind . But now that Brendan Fraser has starred in a Best Picture winner ( " Crash " ) and Rachel Weisz has won Best Supporting Actress for " The Constant Gardener " , I expect no more mummies . And one more thing : why did the Scorpion King get his own movie ? I never saw it but heard that it was just an excuse for buff men to flex their muscles . It was actually released the same weekend as " My Big Fat Greek Wedding " , which of course is much more well remembered . No surprise there .
362998	4888011	113677	7.0	the perfect role for Steve Buscemi	We should all know by now that Steve Buscemi is the unofficial king of indie flicks , and " Living in Oblivion " is possibly the best example . He plays the director of a very small movie - something right up his alley - who has to put up with the various problems on the set . We've seen this sort of story before , you say ? Well , remember that Buscemi barely has to do anything to make the movie good ; his pop-eyed gaze pretty much acts all on its own . If absolutely nothing else , this movie is a good look into the work that people have to put into making movies . Of course , I think that we need to consider it for much more than that . This movie has something for everyone , in my opinion . Also starring Catherine Keener , Dermot Mulroney , James LeGros , Peter Dinklage and Kevin Corrigan .
362570	4888011	320355	7.0	film must change with the times	I had known a little bit about the 1960s change in cinema , but " Reel Radicals : The Sixties Revolution in Film " lays it all out . Probably the main aspect that comes to people's minds is the emergence of sexuality on the screen , as shown by the likes of " Midnight Cowboy " and " Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice " . But the overall change was a shift away from the 1950s eye candy to more serious topics : race relations ( " To Kill a Mockingbird " ) , the Cold War ( " Dr . Strangelove " ) , the generation gap ( " The Graduate " ) and overall political upheaval ( " Medium Cool " ) . One thing that I wish that they could have gotten into was when movies from that era had a seemingly apolitical plot as the setting for political commentary . For example , " It's a Mad , Mad , Mad , Mad World " may look like a wacky comedy , but really seems to be a parable of greed , showing how people will do anything for money . For the most part , though , I thought that the documentary did a swell job with its topic . It all brings to mind the fact that the 1960s cinematic shift away from escapism led to 1970s cinema focusing on the fruits of the ' 60s movements , then escapism ( particularly high action ) resurfaced in the ' 80s , and then the indies rose in the ' 90s . It still remains to be seen what specifically 21st century cinema will inhibit . All in all , worth seeing . I might also note that people talk about TV experiencing its major change in the ' 70s , with " All in the Family " and " Sanford and Son " . I would say that there actually was a little bit of a shift in the ' 60s . Aside from shows like " Bewitched " , " Gilligan's Island " and " I Dream of Jeannie " having a semi-psychedelic look , these shows often contained situations where people from the older generation would come across something unfamiliar , and look ridiculous when they tried to explain it ( after all , people not taking part in what happened in the ' 60s couldn't even begin to explain it ) . That's my take on things . But I digress . Definitely a documentary that I recommend .
362763	4888011	71598	7.0	I will forever remember Art Carney as Harry ( I've never seen " The Honeymooners " , and there's apparently no reason to see it ) .	Road movies always make for interesting stories , including " Harry and Tonto " . In a role that won him Best Actor , Art Carney plays retired New Yorker Harry Coombes , who decides to go on a cross-country tour with his cat Tonto . Harry not only visits his son and daughter ( Larry Hagman and Ellen Burstyn , respectively ) , but also manages to live life to its fullest , come what may . Among other things , this movie shows that regardless of what we may assume , old folks still have it even at their age . I guess that when I'm as old as Harry , I'll have to go on a cross-country tour . Who knows what there is out there .
363685	4888011	114168	7.0	it makes sense to set this in Texas	Maybe it's a clich√© to cast Jeff Goldblum as a nerd in " Powder " , but the movie is actually worth seeing . Portraying an albino teenager ( Sean Patrick Flanery ) upsetting his Texas town via his mental abilities , the movie really gives you a feeling of the Lone Star State . I will admit that a story of people ostracizing a different kind of person has been used many times before , but the whole thing about the title character's mental abilities made this one unique . All in all , this is a movie that I recommend . I noticed that the cop looked like Pat Buchanan - and acted like him too . The aforementioned cast members , plus Mary Steenburgen and Lance Henriksen , all do quite well in their roles . I sure didn't see that ending coming .
365589	4888011	289765	7.0	Yes , what is her name ?	Obviously , " Red Dragon " only got made because of " Hannibal " ' s success , but there seems to be more of an element of fear here than in the latter ( which focused more on gut-wrenching violence ) . Once again , the famous cannibal ( Anthony Hopkins ) has to help a detective ( Edward Norton ) find a killer ( Ralph Fiennes ) . As you may imagine , there are some pretty nasty scenes throughout the movie . If the movie has any problem , it's director Brett Ratner . It's just a little hard to take a suspense thriller seriously when it's directed by the man responsible for the " Rush Hour " movies . But other than that , there's a really intense surprise in this movie . You're sure to like it . Also starring Harvey Keitel , Emily Watson , Mary-Louise Parker , Philip Seymour Hoffman , Anthony Heald and Ken Leung . Oh , and one more thing : there's something REALLY interesting at the very end .
364384	4888011	120890	7.0	our introduction to Denise Richards	Obviously , the scene in " Wild Things " that really surprised everyone was a certain scene with Kevin Bacon . But as for the rest of the movie , it involves a rape lawsuit in a Florida high school , and the strange things that follow . I'm not sure how much I can tell you without giving it away . I never would have envisioned so many twists and turns in a movie . As it was , this was our introduction to Denise Richards ( although she had earlier appeared in the worth-seeing " Starship Troopers " ) . All in all , if you come away from this movie royally confused , don't say that I didn't warn you . But don't get me wrong : it's a pretty interesting movie . Also starring Matt Dillon , Neve Campbell , Theresa Russell , Robert Wagner , Bill Murray and Carrie Snodgress .
364399	4888011	79679	7.0	Yes , a slice-of-life story from the Soviet Union .	After " Osenniy marafon " ( called " Autumn Marathon " in English ) came out , director Georgi Daneliya couldn't get any work for about two years ; the movie didn't conform to socialist realism in quite the way that the authorities wanted . It portrays Leningrad teacher Andrei Buzykin ( Oleg Basilashvili ) , whose life seems to be going nowhere . His wife barely notices him , and the only thing really resembling joy is when his Danish friend asks him to go jogging every day . But things may be about to change . The title may refer not only to the jogs with his friend , but the possibility that Oleg's life may be about to completely change ( and how he may have to overcome certain obstacles ) . Maybe . And his friend sure had wild hair for a Danish person - I thought that Scandinavian people usually have very straight hair . Now for a little joke . There ought to be a movie called " Autumn Marathon Man " , in which a burnt out Russian teacher gets some unnecessary dental work .
364172	4888011	89941	7.0	better than you would expect for such a movie	It doesn't quite suffice to call " Runaway Train " an action movie . True , it's got a prison escape and an out-of-control train , but there is actually a plot . After safe cracker Oscar Manheim ( Jon Voight ) and tag-along Buck ( Eric Roberts ) escape from an Alaska prison , they jump onto a train whose engineer suddenly dies of a heart attack . More than simply making every scene a " will they ? ! won't they ? ! " situation , the movie has character development and never moralizes . Nor does it heroify or vilify anyone . The audience is left to develop their own opinions about each of the characters . I won't tell you what happens , but I will let you know that this is one of the only non-mind-numbing action movies that I know .
365606	4888011	790741	7.0	keeping up with the Dickens	Somewhat confusing story about a Londoner ( Vinnie Jones ) who gets involved in a web of intrigue centering on newly discovered Charles Dickens manuals . I spent much of the movie wondering how much of the stuff about Dickens himself was true ; I would like to know more about Charles Dickens as a person . Other than that , the acting kept the movie afloat . Aside from Jones , Derek Jacobi , Julie Cox , Vanessa Redgrave and Jason Flemyng turn in very good performances . It's just that I felt that the movie didn't tell as much about Charles Dickens as I would have wanted to hear . Pretty good otherwise .
362674	4888011	227445	7.0	" Score " one for both the good guys and the bad guys .	Another heist movie ? Actually , this one's pretty good . Mostly notable for being Marlon Brando's final screen appearance , " The Score " has aging thief Nick Wells ( Robert DeNiro ) going in for one last heist in Montreal . Sound like a familiar plot ? It is , and if it was just two hours of violence , it would make your eyes roll , but good performances keep the movie from dragging . Of course , how could it not have good performances , starring Brando , DeNiro , Edward Norton and Angela Bassett . Still , I wonder just how many heist-themed movies there can actually be ( 2001 also saw a movie called " Heist " ) . Who ever would have guessed that Fozzy the Bear - that's Frank Oz - would one day direct together in a movie the two men who played Vito Corleone ?
363021	4888011	89853	7.0	when a rose is more than a rose	Usually , Woody Allen is a director who wishes to avoid Hollywood-style plots , so it's always a surprise when he makes a movie with a deliberately improbably story . " The Purple Rose of Cairo " is an example , with a character ( Jeff Daniels ) in a movie coming out of the movie and into Depression-era New York to be with a down-and-out woman ( Mia Farrow ) . Complete nonsense , you say ? Well , anything can happen in a movie ( especially when there's a movie-within-the-movie ) . Low for Woody Allen , you say ? There aren't any rules about what he can do in movies , his behavior in real life notwithstanding . " TPROC " is a movie and doesn't pretend to be anything else . I recommend it . Also starring Danny Aiello .
362817	4888011	78295	8.0	art sometimes imitates life , sometimes not	While feature films became a staple of 1970s TV - think " Brian's Song " and " Sybil " - few were like John Carpenter's " Someone's Watching Me ! " . The story is quite familiar : a woman ( Lauren Hutton ) moves into an apartment , starts getting strange phone calls , and eventually realizes that there's a peeping tom in the vicinity . As this is a TV movie , there are unfortunately some things that we don't get to see ( namely Lauren Hutton naked ) , and the spots where they obviously had commercial breaks gives the movie a slight feeling of silliness . But the really neat factor springs from the clear homage to other kinds of horror flicks : the voyeurism scenes look like a " Psycho " reference . As for the cast , Lauren Hutton easily looks vulnerable enough , but I can't figure out why the characters in these movies take threatening phone calls in stride ; I would have immediately suspected that something was amiss . You can see Adrienne Barbeau getting primed for the other kinds of between-A-and-B-movies in which she would later star . So , it's mostly your average suspense movie , but certainly one that you'll enjoy . And just be suspicious the next time that your lights start flickering .
363676	4888011	77928	8.0	Hopefully , we've all learned to avoid getting thrown in jail in the Third World .	The movie that made director Alan Parker really famous tells the true - if somewhat exaggerated - story of Billy Hayes ( Brad Davis ) , who got thrown into a hellish Turkish prison after he was caught smuggling hashish . The movie starts off by setting up the historical context . The first thing that you see is Billy and his hubby Susan ( Irene Miracle ) reading about Janis Joplin's death in the paper . But once he gets arrested , then things get ugly . You'll need a strong stomach to watch this movie . That of course means that they did really well with it in every way . Oliver Stone was one of the screenwriters . Also starring Randy Quaid , John Hurt , and Bo Hopkins .
363693	4888011	313196	8.0	Be prepared to have your stomach turn .	I am not Catholic , so my description of this movie may offend some people . " El crimen del padre Amaro " ( called " The Crime of Father Amaro " in English ) portrays newly ordained priest Amaro ( Gael Garcia Bernal ) getting pulled in several directions in a small Mexican town . The most prominent is a simmering desire to have sex with the dazzling Amelia ( Ana Claudia Talancon ) . Finally , it all comes crashing down . . . irrevocably . The Catholic Church was of course disturbed by this movie , but any religious group is likely to get unnerved by any movie that takes a gut-wrenching look at their religion . I certainly thought that the movie does a good job looking at guilt and other such things . But mind you , this is not a movie for the squeamish .
364593	4888011	60176	8.0	there is no reality as long as we only see what we want	In one of the many groundbreaking movies , London fashion photographer Thomas ( David Hemmings ) photographs what may or may not be a murder . Thomas has spent his career photographing Swinging London , but this throws everything into flux . I should admit that " Blowup " is the first of Michelangelo Antonioni's movies that I've ever seen , so I can't use his other ones to help explain what it shows . But I can say that it will probably blow your mind . The events put in question how much we can trust our own judgment . As for the Swinging London aspect , I can't tell whether or not it idealizes that era or looks at its possible superficiality . As for the whole thing about truth and reality vs . what we want to believe ( in this case , Thomas wants there to have been a murder so that he can expose it ) , it works alongside Stephen Colbert's definition of " truthiness " : what we want or immediately believe to be true . There was one scene that I thought looked a bit unrealistic : the Yardbirds concert . Everyone was just standing around staring , rather than getting into the music and dancing . I would have been partying down ( especially when the one guy smashed his guitar ) . But otherwise , I found the movie quite fascinating . Just see whether or not you totally trust yourself after watching this . Also starring Vanessa Redgrave and Sarah Miles .
363245	4888011	44797	8.0	So you think that YOU'VE got trouble ?	Robert McKimson's " Kiddin ' the Kitten " is a delightfully crazy look at turning manipulation and exploitation on its head . When slothful cat Dodsworth is ordered to rid his house of mice , he doesn't quite know what to do ( after all , for generations no Dodsworth has ever stooped to physical labor ) . So , he opens a bogus mouse-catching school and " trains " an anonymous kitten how to trap rodents , so that it looks as though he , Dodsworth , has been doing his job . But not only is this kitten cleverer than Dodsworth throughout the whole " lesson " , once the little guy wises up to Dodsworth's shenanigans , things won't go so easily ! All in all , I have to disagree with some people who in other reviews belittled McKimson's work . He really did have his own interesting style . For example , whereas Chuck Jones and Friz Freleng portrayed Bugs Bunny as a stay-at-home type whose life gets invaded , McKimson would often portray him as an adventurer . Honestly , if Warner Bros . had closed McKimson's animation unit instead of Arthur Davis's , we wouldn't have Foghorn Leghorn , Hippety Hopper or the Tasmanian Devil . Anyway , this is a good one . McKimson cast Dodsworth and the kitten the following year in " A Peck o ' Trouble " , only that time the kitten had yellow fur . In the late 1940s , due to a financial situation , Warner Bros . couldn't keep four animation units opened , and had to close one . Since Jones , Freleng and McKimson were all tenured , they discontinued Arthur Davis's unit ( which had been Bob Clampett's unit until Clampett left ) . During his approximately two years as a director , Davis did turn out some interesting shorts , namely " Bowery Bugs " . PS : Sheldon Leonard , who provided Dodsworth's voice , produced " The Danny Thomas Show " , " The Andy Griffith Show " and " The Dick Van Dyke Show " .
364116	4888011	52117	8.0	Never underestimate Paul Newman's and Joanne Woodward's comic abilities .	" Rally ' Round the Flag , Boys ! " may be a movie that you never get to see . As far as I know , it's not available on video or DVD ; I saw it on TV one night . But anyway , here's the story : Harry Bannerman ( Paul Newman ) and Grace Oglethorpe ( Joanne Woodward ) are a typical ( or not so typical ) suburban couple in an idealistic 1950's small town in Connecticut . Then , when the army announces plans to build a secretive base near the town , Harry is hired to promote it , while Grace does everything possible to oppose it . In the process of everything , the townspeople begin to see things that they've never seen before - namely , when Grace catches Harry . . . well , I won't spoil it for you ( don't worry , it's not ( particularly ) dirty ) . The whole thing ends in one wacky climax . Anyway , this is one of those interesting movies from the late ' 50s starring A-list stars , that for some reason doesn't seem to be very well remembered today . Good support comes from Tuesday Weld and Dwayne Hickman as local teenagers .
365388	4888011	28467	8.0	once again , I see the spoof before I know that there was an original	When I watched Tex Avery's " The Village Smithy " , I assumed that it was an original idea created by the Termite Terrace crowd ; I was more than a little surprised when I read on IMDb that it was based on a Henry Wadsworth Longfellow poem ! But no matter whence it came , it's quite a funny cartoon , as Porky Pig works as a blacksmith's assistant and inadvertently sends his boss on the wildest ride ever . There have been numerous instances in which I've seen a spoof of something while having no idea that it's a spoof . Certainly a number of these instances involved Looney Tunes / Merrie Melodies cartoons ( I saw " What's Opera , Doc ? " long before I'd ever even heard of Wagner's work ) . It's also happened with " The Simpsons " ( I remember when Maggie hit Homer on the head with a mallet and red paint flowed down a drain ; only later did I see " Psycho " and get the reference ) . There are many pop songs that I only learn about because I hear " Weird Al " Yankovic's parodies , and many B-movies that I only see on " Mystery Science Theater 3000 " . I wouldn't be surprised if many members of my generation encounter the spoofs of famous works before encountering the originals . But anyway , this is a pretty funny cartoon . Porky sure did some neat stuff during the two years when he was Warner Bros . top cartoon star . I bet that we all miss some things when we're not looking .
363784	4888011	59113	8.0	There are some things that we just can't get over .	Omar Sharif remains indelibly associated with Dr . Yuri Zhivago , a Russian physician-poet who participates in the Bolshevik Revolution , only to have political history affect him against his will . Julie Christie is beautiful as ever as Lara Antipova , Zhivago's true love . " Doctor Zhivago " certainly pulled off a coup by showing the conditions that led to the revolution : the czar's despotic rule , the crushing poverty , and forced conscription ( especially since the generals cared nothing about the men under their command ) . Then , of course , the Russian people thought that they would have a workers ' society , but it didn't turn out that way . The theme song " Lara's Theme " kept the movie going every step of the way . Maybe not the greatest historical drama of all time , but this is a movie that I recommend to everyone .
365748	4888011	52357	9.0	don't look down	You understand " Vertigo " better once you know the word's definition . It refers specifically to dizziness , not acrophobia as some people mistakenly believe . Dizziness plays a major role in the movie . Jimmy Stewart plays San Francisco Det . John " Scottie " Ferguson , who gets uncomfortable in high places . Hired to follow Madeleine Elster ( Kim Novak ) , he rescues her from drowning . As he stays with her more and more , he begins to suspect something strange about her . It all comes to a head at the San Juan Bautista Mission , when she jumps off of the bell tower . Scottie feels guilty , but some questions remain unanswered . Just who is that woman whom Scottie sees in the museum ? Why does she look exactly like Madeleine ? And how does a Spanish woman who lived almost 100 years earlier relate to all this ? The spirals are an eye-opening aspect . Not only the opening credits , but also Scottie's acrophobia , and the staircase in the bell tower . As is often the case in Alfred Hitchcock's movies , the lighting tells part of the story ; in this case , a sign outside the apartment illuminates Madeleine and her dress . The San Juan Bautista Mission is not an accident . Hitchcock was raised Roman Catholic , so it makes sense that he might want to use such an institution . But the movie's final scene - which happens at the Mission - seems to be a metaphor for things coming back to haunt people . And of course , Kim Novak was one of Hitchcock's " icy blondes " , in the same category as Grace Kelly , Doris Day , Eva Marie Saint , Janet Leigh and Tippi Hedren . All I can tell you further is that there is a scene in which Madeleine is next to a window , and you see her reflection ; that appears to be foreshadowing . All very vertiginous .
364369	4888011	87262	9.0	Take " Carrie " one step further . . .	If you thought that " Carrie " made incredible use of conflagrations , you ain't seen nothing yet ! In Stephen King's other combustion-themed story , " Firestarter " portrays the daughter ( Drew Barrymore ) of a experimental guinea pig ( David Keith ) using her ignition abilities to get her way . When the government kidnaps her and her father , things really get ugly . On one level , this movie seems a little preachy , with the shadowy agents going after the man and his daughter . But I would call that an accurate depiction of things . And you gotta agree with what the girl does , no matter how extreme she gets ( and I'm talking really extreme ) . So I definitely recommend this movie . But if you're a pyromaniac , don't let this movie encourage you . Also starring Heather Locklear , Martin Sheen , George C . Scott , Art Carney and Louise Fletcher .
364844	4888011	113870	9.0	Alcatraz = Abu Ghraib	Obviously , we can't tell how much of any historical movie is accurate . But what " Murder in the First " portrays will freeze the blood of any sane person , whether or not it's accurate . Henri Young ( Kevin Bacon ) is sent to Alcatraz for theft and put in solitary confinement . When he comes out , he has turned into a murderous lunatic . So , novice lawyer James Stamphill ( Christian Slater ) uses the incident to expose how cruel Alcatraz is . Naturally , warden Milton Glen ( Gary Oldman ) tries to deny everything , but he can't hide the facts . Another reviewer noted that this particular trial wasn't the one that actually brought down Alcatraz , despite the tag-line . But either way , " Murder in the First " shows the cruelty inherent in the prison system overall , right up to Abu Ghraib . All that you have to do is take a tour of Alcatraz - or any defunct prison - to see what it's like .
363768	4888011	106489	9.0	fear vs . respect	Robert DeNiro made his directorial debut with the gripping " A Bronx Tale " , about a boy in 1960s New York torn between his father and a gangster . Bus driver Lorenzo Anello ( DeNiro ) raises his son Calogero to be an honest person , but Calogero also is interested in mobster Sonny ( Chazz Palminteri , who based the story partly on his own childhood ) . What's really good about the movie is how it presents all sides of the dichotomy . For example , when Calogero claims that people respect Sonny , Lorenzo tells Calogero : " People respect me . They fear him . " Everything in this movie is likely to shock you . You want Calogero to do what he wants , but you're nervous about hoping for him to go into a life of crime . If Robert DeNiro is to be best known for these kinds of roles , then so be it ; he does them very well . The rest of the cast is also great . You may never feel the same after viewing this . Joe Pesci also appears .
363334	4888011	41785	9.0	someone should separate Florida from the rest of the country	When I saw the title and first minute of " Rebel Rabbit " , I sort of assumed that it would be a Robin Hood-style story . Boy was I wrong ! It portrays Bugs Bunny getting insulted when he finds that the government has placed exorbitant bounties on foxes and bears , but only 2 cents on rabbits ( after all , rabbits are such cute little creatures ) . So , the carrot-chomping rascal proceeds to make a complete mess of the United States . The final scene reminded me of the Peter Sellers-Ringo Starr movie " The Magic Christian " , how they ridiculously brought in the most elaborate weaponry to deal with so simple an animal ( then again , Bugs isn't so simple to catch ) . I especially agreed with one scene : Bugs cuts Florida off from the rest of the country . Considering that the Sunshine State is home to the rich Cubans who fled when Fidel Castro's army took over in Cuba , we should break that state off from the rest of the country and send it down to Cuba so that the current government there can prosecute Fulgencio Batista's henchmen . But I digress . The point is , this is a really funny cartoon . That southern senator was obviously Mel Blanc doing Foghorn Leghorn's voice . Really neat .
362641	4888011	120789	9.0	Don Knotts , RIP	Don Knotts's death yesterday brings to mind his various roles . " Pleasantville " probably wasn't his most famous movie , but it's one that I would recommend to everyone . It portrays real-life teenagers David ( Tobey Maguire ) and Jennifer ( Reese Witherspoon ) getting transferred into a 1950's " Leave It to Beaver " - style TV show . Aside from the fact that everything is black-and-white , David and Jennifer ( now called Bud and Mary Sue in the show ) have a hard time adjusting to a world of wives wearing fluffy dresses all day and gray flannel suit-clad husbands saying " Honey , I'm home ! " But David and Jennifer's presence just might change everything . All that I can say is that it would sure be neat to experience this movie . More than just a goofy story , there's a clear reference to racism as colors start showing and everything starts changing . And the way that they use the song " Take Five " is also quite eye-opening . Great performances from the aforementioned cast members , plus Joan Allen , William H . Macy , Jeff Daniels , J . T . Walsh ( in his final role ) , and even Jane Kaczmarek right before she got the role of Lois on " Malcolm in the Middle " , make this one cool movie .
363075	4888011	89424	9.0	dictatorships	Raul Julia and William Hurt play Valentin Arregui and Luis Molina , cell-mates in a South American jail . Valentin is a political prisoner trying to keep his sanity , and Luis is a gay man with fantasies of Nazis and their beautiful women . These two men are opposites in virtually every way , but are forced to grow to respect each other . Sonia Braga plays the woman in both men's fantasies : the " Spider Woman " and the Nazi's lover . That's the plot , but the movie is really a metaphor for any dictatorship . Obviously , any totalitarian state will imprison political opponents , and from what I know , most tyrants choose to lock up homosexuals . Valentin even tries to make the pro-fascist Luis understand what the Nazis did to gays . Regardless of how the two men eventually view each other , it remains a really good movie .
365744	4888011	41434	9.0	this cartoon was not a dog	I'll admit that I don't really know anything about dog races , but you don't need to know anything thereabout to enjoy " The Grey Hounded Hare " . Bugs Bunny stumbles upon a dog race , and quickly learns that the contestants don't like rabbits . But what truly riles him is the fact the dogs are chasing the female rabbit with whom he has just fallen in love ( it's a robot , but he doesn't know that ) . So , that long-eared rascal sets about coming up with ways to stop the dogs from chasing the rabbit . That is , until the final showdown with a big bellicose dog . Maybe this isn't the best cartoon that the Looney Tunes ' creative team made , but there's really nothing bad about it . And the end scene is a good lesson about the dangers of electricity .
365312	4888011	80549	9.0	Believe it or not , I can find one unrealistic thing ( but it doesn't drag down the film at all ) .	I knew loosely about Loretta Lynn before I saw " Coal Miner's Daughter " . When I saw the movie , I not only got a sense of her personal life , but also of the culture out of which she grew . We see how her family was one of the most destitute imaginable , with more children than they could handle , and so Loretta's parents felt like they had no choice but to marry her off at the age of thirteen . As for Doolittle , we see how he clearly had a lot of problems - namely drinking and womanizing - but was a decent person at heart . From the beginning , the movie fascinates . Playing a thirteen-year-old , Sissy Spacek has no trouble looking the part . As the story progresses and Loretta ages , she still looks the part ( I don't think that I've ever seen anyone else do that ; that alone may have been what won her the Best Actress Oscar ) . Tommy Lee Jones is equally great as Doolittle , showing him as a sorry but still respectable person . There was one mildly unrealistic thing that I noticed in the movie . Loretta's father Ted ( Levon Helm ) looked a little too clean and polished for someone who spent his days working in the coal mines . But that doesn't drag the movie down at all . " CMD " is a very good movie , affirming Sissy Spacek and Tommy Lee Jones as two of the greatest actors of our time . Among other things , the movie also shows that Michael Apted ( happy birthday , Michael ! ) is a director whom we need to recognize more . He also directed the " 7 Up " series , " Agatha " , " Continental Divide " , " Gorky Park " , and the never - released - on - video - or - DVD " Stardust " , among other things . Anyway , it's a very good movie . I definitely recommend it . Also starring Beverly D'Angelo as Patsy Cline .
363917	4888011	833875	9.0	Even though I didn't catch the whole thing , it was still great .	When I read that " The 79th Annual Academy Awards " started at 5 pm , I assumed that the lead-in started then . When I turned the channel on at about 5 : 50 , I saw that they were well into the ceremony . Criminy ! But no worries , I saw most of it , and I really liked it . I especially laud them for FINALLY giving Martin Scorsese what he's deserved for so long , for giving Alan Arkin what he's deserved for so long , and for giving Ennio Morricone what he's deserved for so long . Kudos above all to Al Gore for calling on the world to deal with global warming and reminding us that it's not a political issue , but a moral one ( and I'm glad to see that Leonardo DiCaprio is part of the movement to curb global warming ) . What do I think of Ellen DeGeneres as a host ? Well , after Jon Stewart last year , I guess that anyone might seem a little weak , but I liked how she did ( particularly that trick with Scorsese ) . Even if she's not the best host ever , she's gotta be better than Bob Hope . I notice that Best Actress went to Helen Mirren - who's also deserved an Oscar for years - for playing a queen , and Best Actor went to Forest Whitaker for playing a king ( the last one of Scotland , that is ) . Jennifer Hudson's win is the perfect slap in the face to " American Idol " ( they kicked her off , believing that she had no talent ) . As is often the case , the best parts are the montages . I liked that the writing montage included scenes from " The Shining " , and the history montage included a scene from " Dr . Strangelove " . Good that they included Robert Altman in the " In Memoriam " , but I think that he should have gotten his own montage . I bet that this ceremony must have really irked the right-wingers . Aside from the fact that a lesbian hosted , a lesbian won for Best Original Song ( and for a documentary about global warming at that ) , honorary winner Sherry Lansing sits on a stem cell research board , and they gave some awards to " Babel " and " El laberinto del Fauno / Pan's Labyrinth " ( both by Mexican directors ) . I hope that tomorrow night , Stephen Colbert - in his right-wing commentator persona - rants against the Academy for all this . In fact , they ought to have him host the Oscars next year ; he would probably be better than Jon Stewart . So , it was a great ceremony . Each of the Best Picture nominees received at least one Oscar . If Scorsese really meant that " The Departed " was his first movie with a plot , then it paid off . A fine few hours . But what did Cameron Diaz do to her face ?
362649	4888011	52600	10.0	A great relic of the " thaw " .	After Stalin died , Khrushchev denounced him in started allowing more artistic freedom ( this era was known as the " thaw " ) . Probably the two best results film-wise were " Letyat zhuravli " ( " The Cranes are Flying " in English ) and " Ballada o soldate " ( " Ballad of a Soldier " in English ) . The latter portrays Pvt . Alyosha Skvortsov ( Vladimir Ivashov ) getting a leave of absence during WWII so that he can visit his mother . He travels across the countryside , meets various people , and falls in love with Shura ( Zhanna Prokhorenko ) , a young woman whom he meets on a train . One of the interesting things about this movie is that it starts by telling the audience that Alyosha got killed in WWII . Even though we know throughout the whole movie that he eventually gets killed ( which the movie doesn't show ) , we always root for him . The movie in fact begins in the same place where it started . The opening shows a road in Alyosha's home town , and the last scene shows him walking down the road after seeing his mother . We don't find out how he gets killed , we just know that he is a hero for his country . All in all , a great movie .
365666	4888011	87928	10.0	This shows that movies can be stupid and funny at the same time .	Okay , so " Police Academy " is probably the ultimate manifestation of the word " witless " . But it doesn't pretend to be anything other than what it is : nice , silly fun . The plot basically has a series of goof-off misfits enrolling in the police force and turning it topsy-turvy . Steve Guttenberg , as Cadet Carey Mahoney , may have to remember this as his peak in movies , and he does a pretty good job here . Anyway , the movie is pretty much an excuse to be silly . And they do just that . With hilarious one-liners and one gag after another , you won't be disappointed . Of course , I advise you not to watch it if you're the type who only wants to see " important " movies .
364357	4888011	373074	10.0	absolutely awesome	In recent years , the American assumption about Hong Kong cinema seems to be that their movies consist of chop-socky wackiness . In that respect , " Kung Fu Hustle " does not disappoint . It tells the story of the Axe Gang , who rule 1940s Hong Kong mafia-style . One of their members is Sing ( director Stephen Chow ) , who joined them because , as he puts it , when he was young , he wanted to be a good guy , but found out that it was easier to be a bad guy . Anyway , the Axe Gang descends on a slum known as Pig Sty Alley , which hides some treasures . But of course , the people who live there aren't going to let the Axe Gang run roughshod over them . From that point on , the movie becomes a cross between Bruce Lee and Chris Farley , especially with the harp-playing scene . Stephen Chow is clearly showing himself to be quite a director , with this movie and with " Shaolin Soccer " . Admittedly , " Kung Fu Hustle " is not any kind of masterpiece ; as far as I can tell , it exists for the sole purpose of entertainment . But let's face it , that's the case with most martial arts movies ( you might recall that " Enter the Dragon " really had no reason for existence except to show off Bruce Lee's impressive skills ) . There is one scene in this movie where Pig Sty Alley's landlady ( Qiu Yuen ) chases one of the gangsters in what appears to be a spoof of / homage to the Road Runner-Wile E . Coyote cartoons . 100 % cool .
365685	4888011	77838	10.0	that era may be gone , but the music never will be	The Band plays its final concert in Martin Scorsese's documentary " The Last Waltz " , recorded in San Francisco . Aside from getting to hear the Band and numerous other great performers ( Bob Dylan , Joni Mitchell , Ringo Starr and Neil Young , to name a few ) , the documentary is also a look back at an era gone by . Among other things , the layered hairdos that they have look a lot better than the spiked hair that we see nowadays . It just goes to show that even if that specific era has passed , the music will never die . This documentary is nostalgia in its best form . May the Band's work be remembered forever ! I recommend " The Last Waltz " to everyone .
363716	4888011	77975	10.0	what a wonderful world it is with John Belushi being a P-I-G	Everybody knows the story of Faber College's wild Delta fraternity making their own rules while the law-and-order-obsessed dean tries to expel them in 1962 . But you still have to see it ! Whether it's John Belushi's whole skit in the cafeteria , the toga party , or the grand finale , " Animal House " is a laugh riot from beginning to end . How anyone was able to come up with something so damn hilarious shows what geniuses some people are . As for some of the characters , we'll first focus on the Deltas . Belushi's John " Bluto " Blutarsky is in a class all by himself , Eric " Otter " Stratton ( Tim Matheson ) is a new kind of pervert , Donald " Boone " Schoenstein ( Peter Riegert ) toes too many lines for his own good , Larry " Pinto " Kroger ( Tom Hulce ) tries but fails to play it straight , and Kent " Flounder " Dorfman ( Stephen Furst ) is a dork . Then , there's the vicious Omega house . Gregg Marmalard ( James Daughton ) is the creepiest of the creepy , Sgt . Douglas Niedermeyer ( Mark Metcalf ) represents the army's nastiest aspects , and Chip Diller ( Kevin Bacon in his debut ) shows that new doesn't necessarily mean good . Next , the older characters . Dean Vernon Wormer ( John Vernon ) is almost a Nazi , Prof . Dave Jennings ( Donald Sutherland ) is a proto-hippie , Marion Wormer ( Verna Bloom ) seems unfulfilled in life , and Mayor Carmine DePasto ( Cesare Danova ) likes to extort . And then there's the women . Katy ( Karen Allen ) is dating Boone but is often displeased with him . But especially noticeable are Mandy Pepperidge ( Mary Louise Weller ) and Babs Jansen ( Martha Smith ) . Maybe it's Babs ' sweet-talking accent , or maybe it's the camera angle on Mandy when Otter is talking to her in the cafeteria , or maybe it's the scene where Bluto is looking up their dresses , or maybe it's the scene where Bluto watches Mandy undress . But whatever it is , those two babes each deserve their own chapters in the Encyclopedia of Hot Women , if there ever is one ! Anyway , " Animal House " is beyond hilarious . Not even the grouchiest , most miserly person could resist laughing . Every time that I hear " Wonderful World " , I think of John Belushi piling the food onto his tray . On that subject , the soundtrack rivals " American Graffiti " in terms of how neat it is . SEE THIS MOVIE AT ALL COSTS !
363391	4888011	52390	10.0	mine hero	Yet again , Wile E . Coyote ( insert scientific name involving eating ) sets a series of traps to get Road Runner ( insert scientific name involving speed ) , but always gets himself . Probably the coolest one here is a tornado seed . Sure enough , he gets sucked in . . . and then there's a mine field ! And the guy still doesn't give up ! True , even before " Whoa , Be-Gone ! " starts , you know what sorts of things are going to happen , but it's still a hoot . After all , WEC always gets his just desserts for trying to harm RR ( another one of the tricks involves a trampoline ) . It's truly a classic . Available on Volume 2 Disc 2 of the Looney Tunes DVDs .
363503	4888011	104504	10.0	Don't believe anyone who says that we don't have political prisoners .	With " Incident at Oglala " , Robert Redford and Michael Apted exposed how American Indian Movement activist Leonard Peltier was unjustly convicted of murder . It was obvious that the whole thing was politically motivated . And regardless of who committed the murders , they were intimidating the Indians . And anyway , the white people stole the Indians ' land to begin with , so the Indians had every right to stand up for themselves . The point is that any time that the US government talks about freedom and democracy , it's pure hypocrisy . An innocent man sits in jail while thugs rule the White House . This is an important documentary for everyone .
364923	4888011	78748	10.0	In space , no one can hear you scream . . . but in the theater / TV room , EVERYONE will !	There may be debates over whether movies should portray aliens positively or negatively , but " Alien " shows that all bets are off . This is possibly THE perfect sci-fi / horror flick ; in fact , it doesn't even suffice to call it such . From the moment when the egg attacks Kane ( John Hurt ) to Ellen Ripley's ( Sigourney Weaver ) battles against the title character , this movie has you tensed up every second of the way . You may be very suspicious of every movement around you after watching this movie . Obviously , what made " Alien " so great was that it had a woman going all bad-ass on a big ugly creature from another world . You probably know about the " chest " scene ( or maybe you've seen a spoof of it ) , but you have to see it to believe it ! All in all , this is a great movie . Weaver turns in a top-notch performance , and great support from Hurt , Harry Dean Stanton , Yaphet Kotto , Ian Holm , Veronica Cartwright and Tom Skerritt , add to the movie's high quality . " Aliens " was also pretty good , " Alien 3 " was tolerable , and " Alien : Resurrection " was . . . well , that's debatable . But this one remains the best . 1979 was truly a great year for movies , what with " Alien " , " Apocalypse Now " , " Being There " , " The China Syndrome " , " 1941 , " . . . And Justice For All " and " Nosferatu " .
363805	4888011	78346	10.0	And then , Christopher Reeve became even more of a superhero in real life .	Obviously , everyone knows Superman , so I'll talk about a few aspects . It was sort of a shock to everyone when Christopher Reeve got paralyzed , seeing as to how we associated him with the man of steel . But his tireless crusade for people with spinal cord injuries showed him to be a sort of superhero in his own right . As Superman's father Jor-El , Marlon Brando seems subdued , but still shows why he was one of the greatest actors of all time ( as it was , he and Reeve died within four months of each other ) . As villain Lex Luthor , Gene Hackman makes a really interesting character : vile , but kinda cool , he's the bad guy who we all want to be deep down . Margot Kidder also has a great role as the title character's self-standing hubby Lois Lane , and Ned Beatty is really funny as Luthor's goofy sidekick Otis . Also starring is Marc McClure as Jimmy Olson . I remember a " Saturday Night Live " episode where they imagine what would have happened had Superman been raised in Germany : they conclude that the man of steel - played by Dan Aykroyd in that skit - would have joined the Nazis and been called Ubermann . As it was , Friedrich Nietzsche theorized an " Ubermensch " . All in all , " Superman " is an inimitable superhero flick . I agree with a previous reviewer that " Batman " and " Spiderman " owe a lot to this movie . Truly great .

363366	4888011	443729	10.0	From the halls of Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli . . .	" Bugs and Daffy : Wartime Cartoons " has renowned film critic Leonard Maltin presenting several WWII-themed Looney Tunes cartoons . I had known that Warner Bros . released some cartoons portraying Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck making mincemeat out of Nazis , but I didn't about the ones portraying life back in the states . I guess that what I really liked in this documentary was that it consisted mostly of the cartoons and not excessive descriptions of them ; after all , we watch these things so as to see the cartoons . If anything surprised me , it was that the Termite Terrace crowd didn't have Elmer Fudd go up against Hitler . But anyway , it's a pretty neat documentary . I guess that " Russian Rhapsody " must have been the only cartoon that unequivocally made the Russians look like the good guys .
365561	4888011	261392	10.0	Everything that anyone's ever been awaiting .	For all who have spent their lives waiting for wacky , biting satire , wait no more . " Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back " is here and as funny as can be . Portraying the title characters ( Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith ) trying to stop Hollywood from making an illegal movie based on their lives , the movie is basically a joke every minute . Probably the funniest aspect is the way that various people appear in the movie making fun of their roles in other movies ( check out Matt Damon's and Ben Affleck's appearance ) . I should warn you that this is not a movie for prudes . The George Carlin scene will particularly rile such people , as will the whole part about the " clit " . But Kevin Smith's fans are sure to love this movie . Also starring in hilarious roles are Will Ferrell , Shannon Elizabeth , Carrie Fisher , Chris Rock , and several others ( I did what the movie commanded when a certain " Star Wars " cast member appeared ) . A real treat for all .
364856	4888011	44609	10.0	the truth about cats and dogs	In a documentary that I saw about Chuck Jones , he talked briefly about " Feed the Kitty " , and the idea that this big brute of a bulldog gets so easily charmed by an innocent little kitten . It's certainly a fascinating idea , and the risk of the kitten getting discovered - or worse - by the dog's owner naturally raises the stakes . I would imagine that there might be some controversy about the portrayal of the dog's owner ( a housewife who spends her days baking cookies and vacuuming ) , but we can't blame the whole cartoon for that . The point is that this is the sort of work that you least expect , and it comes out perfect . And to think that the first scene shows some evil-looking eyes . . . that turn out to be the kitten !
365227	4888011	44516	10.0	Actually , it's a good thing ( for us , that is ) that he didn't fly south earlier !	While flying south later than he should have , Daffy Duck accidentally crashes into Porky Pig's house . Inside , he meets an uncommunicative duck . One thing leads to another until Daffy vows to beat the stuffings out of the duck . The only thing is , he literally does , at which point he realizes that it was a stuffed duck . Taking the duck's place , he has to hide from the dog , while Porky doesn't believe the dog's stories that there's a new duck around . OK , so this probably wasn't the best Looney Tunes cartoon ever produced , but it definitely had the wit prevalent in all their cartoons from that era . In " Cracked Quack " , Daffy goes into his totally wacky persona , as opposed to playing second banana to Bugs Bunny ( whose integrity he always tried to undermine ) . But either way , this is still a great cartoon . I guess that the end was the opposite of Independents ' Day !
364256	4888011	24601	10.0	one can see the possible inspiration for Gilligan and the Skipper	No one can deny that Laurel and Hardy were THE comic duo . " Sons of the Desert " is one of many movies showing this . This one has them as members of a Shriners-like society attending a convention against the wishes of their strict wives . While it was obvious that Stan and Ollie's wives were going to somehow discover what the two men were up to , I still couldn't have predicted what would result ! You gotta wonder how much fun they must have had filming it ! I once read about how , because Laurel's the idiot and Hardy's the straight man , their embarrassing situations always lead to greater shame for Hardy since it's more of a downfall for him . That's the case here all the way ! Watching the movie , I get the feeling that their mishaps may have inspired the antics of Gilligan and the Skipper . All in all , a really funny movie .
363705	4888011	426578	10.0	everyone needs to challenge every government	I had never heard of Sophia Scholl before I saw " Sophie Scholl - Die letzten Tage " , but I can say that the events portrayed in this movie should be interpreted as an allusion to the current state of affairs , whether or not they were intended as such . Sophia Magdalena Scholl ( Julia Jentsch ) was a student , staunchly opposed to the Nazi regime , in a German university during WWII . She , her brother Hans , and friend Christoph distributed some fliers questioning the government's moral authority and military capability ( this was around the time that Germany suffered major losses in Stalingrad ) . Unfortunately , they both got arrested , put through a show trial , and summarily executed . During the interrogations , many of the interrogator's verbal attacks contend that by reporting on troop losses , Sophie , Hans and Christoph were undermining the troops . I can't think of anything that sounds more like that than when George W . Bush and his people claim that political opponents questioning his modus operandi and media outlets reporting on troop losses help the terrorists ; sort of like Spiro Agnew's infamous remark about " nattering nabobs of negativism " . But either way , I consider this a great movie . All the cast members do a top-notch job , to the point where you really get a feel for what happens to them . As it is , when the interrogator tells Sophie about his life before Hitler came to power , it reminds one of why people joined the National Socialist party ( many of the members were outcasts and felt that this was their only way to get respected ) . I thoroughly recommend the movie , and would like to assert that Julia Jentsch is really showing herself to be a capable actress , with this one and " The Edukators " .
363560	4888011	36444	10.0	none of this or this or this ( but lots of the cartoon , please )	Few of the Looney Tunes / Merrie Melodies shorts dealt with physical activities more hilariously than " To Duck . . . or Not to Duck " , as over-energetic Daffy challenges gullible Elmer to a boxing match weighed heavily in his own favor . If you thought that the White Sox scandal of 1919 was screwed up , then you ain't seen nothing yet ! Quite simply , it's the sort of thing that only Daffy could do . I noticed in one scene that Elmer's pants fell down and it looked like you could see his butt ! They actually got that on screen in 1943 ! Of course , these cartoons were always looking for ways to push the limits . I'd better be certain of that or my name isn't Lee Eisenberg . . . and it isn't ! ( just kidding : it is )
362930	4888011	59646	10.0	If you thought that you knew scary , think again . . .	Fear plays a factor in most of Roman Polanski's movies that I've seen , but in none more so than in the blood-freezing " Repulsion " . His first English-language movie casts Catherine Deneuve as London manicurist Carole Ledoux . She lives a sexually repressed life in her sister's apartment . When her sister and brother-in-law go out for a few days , Carole irrevocably degenerates into a totally chaotic state . Some people may call this movie a psychological thriller . I would like to assert that calling this movie a psychological thriller would be like calling " The Graduate " a sex film or " 2001 : A Space Odyssey " a science fiction film . Without any special effects or gratuitous violence , they create an environment of fear like I've rarely seen in movies . It seems a little bit as if Catherine Deneuve as this beautiful young woman trapped in a horrific state sort of precedes Mia Farrow's role in " Rosemary's Baby " ( although this one induces much more fear ) . So just watch " Repulsion " and you'll see what a horror movie can really be . And it just might save your life .
363701	4888011	86129	10.0	she's sick of these mother - ( censored ) snakes coming out of this mother - ( censored ) toilet	Bob Clark's untimely death in a car crash a few days ago brings to mind his career , including " Porky's II : The Next Day " . This one hilariously continues the get-laid-at-any-cost adventures of the teenage boys portrayed in the original movie . The actual plot has their school putting on a production of Shakespeare plays and getting threatened by the Ku Klux Klan , an angry clergyman , and hypocritical politicians . Of course , it's all an excuse for any crazy idea that they can dream up . I nearly laughed myself hoarse during the restaurant scene , not only at what was happening but also trying to imagine how much fun they must have had filming it ! Anyway , it's just a pleasure to watch , particularly with what happens in the cemetery , and the whole end sequence . This was a sequel that equaled its original . And if you remember the " electric sex " from " A Christmas Story " , check out the Shakespeare performance here ! Just hilarious . To play off of what another Porky famously said : th-th-th-that'll never be all , folks ! In conclusion : Bob Clark , wherever you are , we'll always remember you , if only for the " Porky's " movies . Bob Clark directed flicks as different as the " Porky's " movies , " Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things " and " A Christmas Story " . The things that we see in life . . .
362963	4888011	79579	10.0	You usually don't expect to see some of these things .	The second Best Foreign Language Film winner from the Soviet Union was something impressive . " Moskva slezam ne verit " ( called " Moscow Does Not Believe in Tears " in English ) starts out portraying three college friends in 1958 , and picks up twenty years later . In 1958 , Katya ( Vera Alentova ) is motivated , hard-working and bright , while Liudmila ( Irina Muravyova ) is manipulative , shallow and scheming , and Antonina ( Raisa Ryazanova ) is shy and simple . They're all from the countryside , but all looking to get jobs in the city . Over the next few days , Antonina ends up with one Nikolai , and these two are the most traditional ; Liudmila ends up with hockey player Sergei . Katya , meanwhile , gets filmed for a TV project on the factory by cinematographer Rudolph , who ends up getting her pregnant . They try to talk things over at a park bench , but he just leaves . Twenty years later , the movie focuses on Katya's redemption , one might say . She is now the director at the factory ( and even gets to drive to work , practically unheard of in the USSR ) , and her daughter Alexandra is doing quite well . Granted , Katya's successful in her public life , but what about privately ? It looks as though her personal life will remain empty until she meets one Gosha ( Alexei Batalov ) , an honest , outspoken , perceptive fellow . She does meet Rudolph again - and this time he's going by his real name Rodion ( he called himself Rudolph because western names were popular in the ' 50's ) - but she leaves him at the bench . This movie makes an interesting use of duality . There are two meetings in the park ; Rudolph / Rodion leaves Katya the first time , but she leaves him the second time . Rudolph / Rodion makes two speeches about how TV is the wave of the future and will eliminate theater , movies , and books . There are two trips to the countryside . Katya twice falls asleep crying . Katya is twice filmed for a TV interview by Rudolph / Rodion ; she's working at the factory the first time , and she's the director the second time . And finally , there are two scenes where people dance to " Besame mucho " . And watch how they use the alarm clock in the middle of the film . Among other things , how Gosha and Rudolph / Rodion bond at the end is classic for Soviet cinema . And , we get to see remnants of the ' 50's and ' 70's that even we in the west can understand : as teenagers , the girls swoon over movie stars ( and their socks looked kind of like bobby sox ) , and people wear colorful clothes in the ' 70's . A classic in every sense of the word .
363471	4888011	50634	10.0	Let's face it : the Russians do a better job at making war movies than we do	If you believe that any given war movie can make you really feel the war , you need to see " Letyat zhuravli " ( called " The Cranes are Flying " in English ) . It tells the story of Veronika ( Tatiana Samoylova ) and Boris ( Aleksey Batalov ) , who are in love on the verge of WWII . They are walking along the waterfront , watching the cranes fly by , when the war starts . Boris is promptly sent off to war . Veronika hides out with a family and ends up marrying the son , whom she does not love . Boris , meanwhile , continues trotting through the countryside , fighting the Nazis and experiencing all the horrors of war , until he he runs out of energy . When Veronika - working in a military hospital - receives this news , she refuses to accept it , until Boris ' body arrives home on one of the trains . Simultaneously , the radio announces that Germany has surrendered and the Allied Powers have won the war ; the Soviet Union lost 27 million citizens , but it's the start of a new era . This movie did a very good job showing the human impact of the war not only in the battlefield , but also how it affected the civilian population . This is definitely a movie that everyone should see .
364069	4888011	97576	10.0	The 3rd time IS the charm !	After " Temple of Doom " went off in another direction , Steven Spielberg got the trilogy back on track with " Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade " . The plot of course has the eponymous archaeologist ( Harrison Ford ) and his father Henry ( Sean Connery ) battling Nazis while searching for the Holy Grail . The hot babe this time is Dr . Elsa Schneider ( Alison Doody ) , while Denholm Elliott and John Rhys-Davies return as Marcus Brody and Sallah , respectively . My favorite scene ? Hard to say ; this movie had so many cool scenes . OK , so the Indiana Jones movies were basically escapism , but well-done escapism . You won't be disappointed after seeing this movie .
363165	4888011	80354	10.0	Robert Forster before " Jackie Brown " , John Sayles before " Lone Star " , and other stuff	Fun , satirical horror flick reminding us of the dangers of flushing our aquatic pets down the toilet . In this case , a flushed alligator ends up in the sewer , where he gets exposed to a chemical and grows to behemoth size and moves above ground to look for people too stupid to pay attention to their surroundings . When will these dopey characters ever learn ? ! What I noticed when watching the movie was the presence of Robert Forster some years after " Medium Cool " and many years before " Jackie Brown " . I guess that he had to do something in between . And it may be surprising that John Sayles was involved with these sorts of movies early in his career , but I consider it perfectly justified ; there were far worse movies with which he could have been involved . Anyway , it's a nice way to pass time . The sequel was lower but not dreadfully terrible . I wonder whether or not Sue Lyon ( the ABC / NBC reporter ) was the same Sue Lyon who played Lolita .
364441	4888011	80339	10.0	Remember not to call him Shirley !	By now , everyone must know about " Airplane ! " . A spoof of the disaster movies of the 1970s replete with every gag imaginable . Whether it's the announcers arguing over the red zones and white zones , the obnoxious solicitors , the jumping artificial heart , the oddly named crew , the automatic pilot , or the various media sources around the world , the goofiness just keeps on coming . The relationship between Ted Striker ( Robert Hays ) and Elaine Dickinson ( Julie Hagerty ) basically takes a back seat to the outlandish one-liners ( " We have to get this woman to a hospital . " " A hospital ? What is it ? " " It's a big building with patients , but that's not important now . " ) If you ask me , humor doesn't have to reflect the real world ; a bunch of wacko gags works just fine . And that's just what " Airplane ! " is . I guess that you could say that Leslie Nielsen ( himself a veteran of " The Poseidon Adventure " , a typical disaster flick ) was getting honed for the " Naked Gun " movies .
364433	4888011	103074	10.0	this is what modern classics are all about	I may not know anyone named Thelma , but whenever I meet someone named Louise , I will probably be tempted to remember " Thelma & Louise " . This story of two women ( Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis ) who have to go on the lam after one of them kills a rapist in chauvinistic Texas truly shows the potentials of life . I guess that the main question is not whether or not " Thelma & Louise " is a women's empowerment story ( although it certainly is ) . Really , it looks at our deep-down capabilities . Solid performances by Sarandon and Davis , not to mention Harvey Keitel and an up-and-coming Brad Pitt , and solid direction from Ridley Scott make this one of the best movies of 1991 .
365827	4888011	33260	10.0	Hedy Wamarr ? Bawbwa Stanwyck ? Owivia de Haviwand ? Did children recognize those names in 1940 ?	On one level , " A Wild Hare " is a historical reference as it was the first teaming of Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd . But even ignoring that , it's still a hoot , with that " wascawy wabbit " making mincemeat of Elmer . There's just one thing that raises my eyebrows nowadays . Elmer asks about Hedy Lamarr , Barbara Stanwyck and Olivia de Havilland . Did six-year-old children in 1940 know who those women were , cuz I sure didn't recognize those names when I was six . Oh well , it's still a great cartoon . Always a classic . And it sure wasn't the wast time that that wascawy wabbit twicked Elmer Fudd . Olivia de Havilland . Just yesterday , I saw " The Adventures of Robin Hood " , and let me tell you : she looked hot in those dresses !
364948	4888011	120812	10.0	buddy comedies ever after	Obviously , " Rush Hour " is mostly just another buddy comedy , but there's so much hilarious dialogue between Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker , that it's all worthwhile . When a consul's daughter gets kidnapped , Tucker gets hired to take the case , but Chan gets brought in from Hong Kong to assist . Naturally , they have a very hard time cooperating . I guess that a major aspect of these movies is that you shouldn't try to take them seriously ; just accept them as completely crazy . With Chan doing his martial arts and Tucker being a loudmouth , it's a great time from start to finish . Also starring Elizabeth Pena , Chris Penn , and Tom Wilkinson . I liked the sequel equally .
363451	4888011	59026	10.0	You won't end up saying " Good grief ! "	Charles Schulz's death a few years ago ( in fact , a few weeks after " Peanuts " ended ) , brought to mind his creations . Obviously , " A Charlie Brown Christmas " was one of them . And it remains a classic to this day . The plot of course has Charlie Brown getting put off by the commercialism surrounding Christmas and looking for the holiday's true meaning . I really liked the tree scene . With the way that Bill O'Reilly and company like to claim that there's an " anti-Christmas " war going on with people trying to replace " Christmas " with " holiday " , it's good to know that Charles Schulz and company could always find something meaningful to do .
363756	4888011	120737	10.0	One ring - and three great movies - to rule them all .	A pop culture phenomenon , " The Lord of the Rings : The Fellowship of the Ring " is unlike anything that you've ever seen . The plot of course has several hobbits and humans joining up in Middle Earth to destroy a ring that corrupts whomever possesses it ; in the process , they have to fight off evil beings . The movie is beyond impressive . In fact , there isn't any adjective that can do it justice . You have to see it to believe it . Peter Jackson adapted J . R . R . Tolkien's novel to the screen as a work of art that would otherwise be unfathomable . I've never read the novel , but I can say that Elijah Wood , Ian McKellen , Viggo Mortensen , Sean Astin , John Rhys-Davies , Liv Tyler , Cate Blanchett , Christopher Lee , and Ian Holm , interpret the characters with a style and quality that we usually associate only with history's most distinguished actors and actresses . This is THE movie to see , and parts 2 and 3 were equally good . A masterpiece in the true sense of the word .
364367	4888011	120741	10.0	I did not have sex with that woman , but I am wearing her underwear .	My rating assumes that you're not actually going to bother looking at this page unless you've decided that you like " Jane Austen's Mafia ! " before you've seen it ( I found it pretty funny ) . For anyone else , it's the sort of spoof that - as many reviews said at the time - is destined to sleep with the fishes . A gag-a-minute send-up of history's most famous mafia movies , there's clearly nothing sacred to the people behind this flick ; the whole Sicily sequence makes that clear ( well , what can you expect from the director of " Airplane ! " ? ) . Where Leslie Nielsen seemingly would be is Lloyd Bridges ( in his final role ) as the aging , clumsy don . So , in conclusion , you'll only take interest in this if you accept any kind of humor , no matter how low . But you may be hungry for Italian food after watching it . Also starring Jay Mohr , Billy Burke , Christina Applegate , Olympia Dukakis and Vincent Pastore . And remember : soup is good !
364625	4888011	50176	10.0	the devil made him do it	In case people have forgotten the Tasmanian Devil , " Bedevilled Rabbit " reminds us of him . When Bugs Bunny gets parachuted into Tasmania ( where's that ? ) , Taz quickly gets hungry and sets his sights on Bugs . Sure enough , Bugs is way ahead of Taz , and always can pull anything seemingly out of thin air to play all sorts of tricks . If these cartoons were nothing more than excuses to pull all sorts of crazy gags , then they played it to great effect . It's great to watch them go all out time and again . Truly classic . There will never be any cartoons like these again . Oh , and in case you don't actually know : Tasmania is the island south of Australia .
363167	4888011	50194	10.0	Termite Terrace's folks needn't be anonymous ( especially since AA is essentially a religion )	" Birds Anonymous " is one of the many classic Looney Tunes cartoons that comes across funnier when you're an adult than when you're a kid , as you understand what it's spoofing . In this case , the target is Alcoholics Anonymous , as Sylvester enters an organization that helps cats break their bird addiction . But it's not that easy for him to think about anything other than Tweety ( it's hard to deny that felines really develop dependencies on avians ) . They hit it right on the nail with this cartoon . The meeting early on shows cats talking about how their bird addictions were running their lives into the ground until the organization saved them . And when the organization's rep Sam catches Sylvester trying to eat Tweety , Sam goes off on a speech about how this one snack will open Sylvester's addiction back up ! I actually think that it's really good that they spoofed Alcholics Anonymous . Once , I was watching Penn & Teller's show , and they said that AA is basically a religion . Aside from the fact that a " 12-step program " is a rather dogmatic idea , AA apparently hasn't changed it's modus operandi since its creation in 1935 . But if AA helps people break their addiction , then it probably balances everything out . Anyway , this is a really funny cartoon . Like I said , it becomes funnier once you're old enough to understand it ( as do many if not most of the classic Looney Tunes cartoons ) . It certainly deserved its Oscar .
362849	4888011	120630	10.0	Even for someone who doesn't like Mel Gibson .	As I have a very low opinion of Mel Gibson , it is especially noteworthy that I liked " Chicken Run " . Made by the same people who make the " Wallace and Gromit " cartoons , it portrays a gaggle of hens trying to break out of a British farm - some scenes even spoof " Stalag 17 " and " The Great Escape " - with the help of American rooster Rocky ( Gibson ) . With the perfect blend of humor and suspense ( and in a cartoon no less ! ) , this is one movie that's sure to please everyone . I really liked the constant " holiday " comments , and that end sequence was a hoot . Also starring Julia Sawalha , Miranda Richardson , Jane Horrocks , Imelda Staunton , and Timothy Spall .
363035	4888011	165710	10.0	as this movie proves , the ' 70s will NEVER die	One of the great things about movies that look at times past is the way they poke fun at individuals who didn't get into popular culture . In this case , four friends in 1970s Michigan worship KISS , but one's mother is a fundamentalist Christian who believes that KISS stands for " Knights In Satan's Service " . In a way , " Detroit Rock City " is sort of an excuse to be crazy . Whether it's the scene where the four friends hide out in the girls ' bathroom and listen to the girl in the neighboring stall , or the part where they finally arrive at KISS's concert , this movie has something for everyone . Everyone who loves the ' 70s , that is .
364994	4888011	358273	10.0	this shows why the great movies always come out at the end of the year	Before " Walk the Line " came out , some people thought that Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon would be miscast as Johnny Cash and June Carter . They were not miscast at all . Not only do they both do a great job playing the roles , they do their own singing . This movie does as great a job with its subject as " Ray " did . It makes perfect sense that Phoenix and Witherspoon have received Academy Award nominations ; I'd say that they deserve to win . This movie is a masterpiece in every way . Up in that great music house in the sky , Johnny and June must be proud to know that this movie did such a great job portraying their lives . Perfect .
364745	4888011	102510	10.0	How do they come up with these things ? !	This one has Lt . Frank Drebin ( Leslie Nielsen ) trying to stop villain Quentin Hapsburg ( Robert Goulet ) from kidnapping a solar power advocate . That's the plot , but the movie is of course an excuse for a series of gags , many of which just pop out from the sides . And of course there's Frank's relationship with seductive Jane Spencer ( Priscilla Presley ) . One of their scenes might make you recall a certain scene from " Ghost " , and then what follows . . . well , all that I can say is : HOW DO THEY COME UP WITH THESE THINGS ? ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! I guess that the movie's only weird aspect is seeing O . J . Simpson as Nordberg . But if we can ignore that , the rest is a hoot , especially the opening sequence , the outlines of people's bodies , and the zoo scene . Just great .
