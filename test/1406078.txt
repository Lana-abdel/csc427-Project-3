554709	1406078	179115	1.0	The boyfriend	This misguided comedy , written and directed by Jesus Delgado , is one of the worst films that have ever been produced in Spain . Obviously , this movie was made thanks to help of money available for young talent that have no way to make their films , otherwise . If there was an argument against these subsidies , this film will be a perfect example . First of all , the plot is so convoluted , it makes no sense . The whole thing is just preposterous because we just can't believe in anything that is going on . Just think about poor Veronica , who being the girlfriend of Alex , a detective , has no qualms in making out with a man that is under suspicion for having robbed a bank , Roberto , who also was involved romantically with the young woman years ago . The film is a mess . The director's idea to fill the gaps in the script is to have all his characters cursing all the time . This is a film to avoid at all costs .
555231	1406078	426190	1.0	The king of Viagra	Some comments to this forum are from people that relate to the story being connected to Cuba , in some way , or another . Their comments don't take into consideration how badly the material used for the film plays on the screen . The character of Don Arturo , the Spaniard that goes to Havana to get married to the young and luscious Yoli , rings false from the start . It is clear the heavy makeup used on this person shows the man is fake . We realize why right away as we are being put on . Later on , as Papito decides to impersonate the older man : one realizes they are the same person , which goes to ask viewers to stretch their imaginations in accepting this phony premise to begin with . Director / writer Alexis Valdes take on the material makes this a one joke story stretched to the max without any surprises . Not only that , the acting is amateur , at best . This was a film made and financed in Spain , and as Spanish films go , " Un Rey en La Habana " is a poor excuse of a movie .
556323	1406078	252503	3.0	What was Mamet thinking . .	Frankly , the greatly over-rated David Mamet laid an egg with this film . I mean , did anyone out there care for these people ? Not only that , but the story is so confusing and convoluted that it had a boring effect on me , as well as some of the people at the screening I attended . The plot runs into all kinds of directions without ever making sense . Why does Danny Devito repeats himself constantly in his screen portrayals ? Why does Mamet insists in casting Rebeca Pidgeon in a role that doesn't add anything to the story or the film . Why bother with a female character at all ? Patty Lupone is another wasted female in her 2 scenes . And as long as we're in the subject , why does he cast Ricky Jay in his last films ? He's so untalented actor , as well as he's a great card player ! Better leave him to play poker , not a bad guy ! I wished that Gene Hackman and Delroy Lindo had better parts to play , but it wasn't meant to be . Sorry Mr . Mamet , maybe for your next film choose someone else's material , adapt it as brilliantly as you did with The Winslow Boy and try to work with the great Joe Mantegna , Bill Macy , Alec Baldwin and Alan Arkin again .
555773	1406078	256380	4.0	Is Beauty skin deep , or is it on the eye of the beholder ?	The latest comedy by the Farrelly brothers seems to hold those 2 principles as the theme of this misguided comedy . Jack Black seems to be playing against type in this movie , since he , himself , is plump and not the matinee idol actor you would expect to be the leading man of this film , let alone be the interest of Gwyneth Paltrow . When he sees Rose Mary through his trance-like state , he doesn't seem to notice his own imperfections . He wants to be accepted by the same people that upon looking at him , feel repulsion . He indeed is a shallow person and a creep to top that . But he doesn't spend a second to examine his own ugliness and his own shortcomings in the persuit of the beautiful and elusive women that don't even give him the time of the day until Rose Mary comes into the picture . When Mauricio , who's played by Jason Alexander , appears at the beginning of the film , he looks like he's a monkey , or that he's wearing an enormous yamulke on top of his head . He looks hideous and he makes a perfect companion to Shallow Hal Larson . Jason Alexander seems to be still playing George Constanza in the Seinfeld series and frankly , he's so one-dimensional that his character seems to be the real shallow one . Perhaps another actor would have been able to make this part more enjoyable , the same way that the role of Hal would have been better cast with another leading man . Actually , if you see the trailer , you see all the best moments of the film . I want my money back . Shame on the Farrelly brothers to give us this piece of pure , unadulterated garbage .
554746	1406078	118744	4.0	High camp in Virginia	Jonathan Darby is credited with the writing / directing of this misconceived movie . As an auteur , Mr . Darby , doesn't bring anything new to the medium . " Hush " proves to be a total waste as it appears Mr . Darby had nothing in the way to control the over the top campy performance of Jessica Lange . Ms . Lange is at her worst as Martha , the evil mother behind all the scheming in the film . Her love for her son , and hatred for her daughter-in-law , gives the actress an opportunity to do some of the worst emoting in any film in recent memory . Gwyneth Paltrow must be questioned for her choice of material . Didn't she smell the aroma in reading the script ? Oh well , let's hope she was able to ask for millions of dollars for appearing in this turkey . Jonathan Schaech doesn't fare better . Nina Foch is the only one who comes out the best in her small role of Alice , Martha's wise mother-in-law who has seen right through what's going on . This is a film to watch with friends after having a few drinks , then one might enjoy the " masterpiece " some avid fans thought " Hush " was .
554562	1406078	424345	4.0	Minimum wagers	If success is measured by the size of an audience , or by the amount of laughs a film produces , then " Clerks II " could be deemed a failure . Judging by the reaction at a screening at the Angelika the other day , where the film is playing in two of the biggest theaters , and the couple of feeble laughs it provoked in an audience of less than thirty people , this movie is definitely not a winner . But never fear , Kevin Smith , a clever man , has made sure the film will resonate with the people that will go see the film based on their experience with the original " Clerks " , a much better , and wittier film than its successor proves to be . In many ways , sequels should be avoided because nothing can compare with the previous work , a lesson Mr . Smith should have applied to this misguided attempt to bring back the people of the first film for a reunion . Jeff Anderson , without a doubt , is what holds the movie together . His Randal is still irreverent and foul mouthed . On the other hand , Brian O'Hallaran doesn't fare better with his Dante . In fact , he seemed to be out of it throughout most of the film . The addition of Rosario Dawson , as the manager of Mooby's was a good idea . The cameo appearance of the incomparable Wanda Sykes , as the offended black customer , proves to be one of the highlights of the movie . What doesn't work out in this sequel is the big musical production number of " ABC " with choreography in the parking lot . Kevin Smith , who plays Silent Bob again , and Jason Mewes , who returns as Jay seem like an old joke gone bad . Time has not been kind to them , in spite of the fact they are still dealing " nickel bags " outside of Mooby's and making a lot of money with the profits from selling drugs . " ClerksII " seems to be targeted for an age group that thinks whatever Kevin Smith gives them is the Bible . One wonders how did the Weinstein brothers , who backed this film and only deal with sure hits , came to the conclusion this was going to make them a fortune and be a big successful picture . Best advice to future movie goers is to wait for the DVD .
555074	1406078	903014	5.0	What was Mary Louise thinking ?	The first thought that came into this viewer's mind was to question Ms . Parker on her choice of vehicles . After having seen her in the New York stage in the brilliant " Dead Man Cell Phone " , one can't only guess it was a project that looked good in the written page and it turned out to be a different thing when it started shooting . Granted , Margaret Atwood's novel is not exactly the easiest thing to adapt for the big screen , or even television , as it's the case with this ill conceived idea . Our only suggestion to this talented actress is to stay in New York where she seems to have a knack for choosing plays in which to shine , as she has proved with " How I Learned to Drive " and " Proof " , just to mention two other plays in which she shone . While this is not a horrible film , by any means , the people behind it seem to have not get the essence of Ms . Atwood's work by the way it's presented . Better luck next time .
554892	1406078	293116	5.0	Cellular	Danielle Thompson's film about two unlikely lovers is a bit of a puzzle . She has thrown together two of France's best known actors in a film that doesn't have a lot to say . Perhaps she is making a statement about France's frequent strikes that seem to bring would-be-lovers together ; perhaps she is telling us that strikes are sexy because there are endless possibilities of naughty things between virtual strangers . Juliette Binoche is practically unrecognizable as Rose , the beautician trying to escape a bad relationship . When she flushes the cellular down the toilet , her luck suddenly changes by asking Felix to use his own phone to finish her call . They keep meeting each other at the crowded terminal where stranded passengers have to wait until the strike is settled , perhaps . Jean Reno , is also playing against type ; his usual intensity is gone from the man he is portraying in the movie . Rose with the excessive makeup looks like a lady that entertains private male customers , cash only , please ! The film is light , but ultimately we know what is going to happen , so we're a step ahead of Mlle Thompson ! The only regret is that Sergi Lopez , the magnificent Spanish actor , is completely wasted as the man Binoche is running away from . Besides , better movies have been made about the subject . This is a film to watch in the middle of a transit strike , only ! Who knows , if one is caught up in a French transit strike , one can be lucky and be rewarded with such a delicious prize as Mlle Binoche !
555601	1406078	814768	6.0	Le shopping	Frankly , the trailers for this film looked a lot more promising than what the finished product turned out to be . We are presented with what appears to be the way bored people with money do with their meaningless lives . Now , we are not opposed that Odile , a woman in a marriage that has seen better days , spends her time in the pricey Parisian boutiques frequented by women like her . After all , if she gets her kicks out of doing that , let her have her fun . In the meantime , her husband Jean-Pierre is at his wits ends trying to win the affection of her wife . Instead of dealing directly with the problem , he follows his chauffeur Richard's advice seizing Odile's credit cards . If he thinks he will get away with that , he's got another thing coming to him . Richard , the driver , it turns out , has the same problems his boss has , without the money element . Alexandra Leclere , the writer / director of this French farce , touches on themes that are deeper than what one sees on the screen . Consumerism , machismo , and non-communication between couples that have been married for a while , are some of the themes behind this comedy . The exceptional cast gathered for the picture deserved better material than what they were given . The marvelous Natalie Baye does all she can with Odile . Christian Claver , who plays Jean-Pierre , makes a good impression . Gerard Lanvin's Richard is instrumental in giving his boss the solution for all his problems . Geraldine Pailhas appears as the wife of Richard , a lady with her own problems in a marriage that is also having difficulties . There are a few laughs , but in the end the film doesn't completely satisfy . One wishes Ms . Leclere better luck next time .
554619	1406078	35082	6.0	Ebb tide	It is surprising to learn that John O'Hara wrote the screen play for this movie . At least , the way we see it today , it appears sadly dated and devoid of interest . In fact , one has to question what kind of reception this movie had at the time it was released . Evidently this movie was made on a low budget . It has a feel of a B type picture from the beginning . The set , which passes as San Pablo looks clearly a studio pool . Director Archie Mayo doesn't add anything to make this an interesting story . We know how it will end before hand . Jean Gabin , the great French film star tried his luck in Hollywood . His career in France was much better than what we see in this vehicle . He has great moments in the movie , but everything is against him , and the film , as we watch it today , appears passe and without any interest for the viewer . At best , it's a curiosity piece and a rarity because M . Gabin's short stay in America . He deserved better ! Ida Lupino is Anna , the girl that wants to drown herself and is rescued by Bobo . She shows in the film she could hold her own against a more experienced and worldly Gabin . Claude Rains , as Nutsy , is hard to recognize in the opening scenes . One wonders why did he take this role since it didn't add anything to his otherwise brilliant career . He must have made this movie right after Casablanca , in which he shines . Thomas Mitchell also appears as Tiny , the heavy man intent in blackmailing Bobo and trying to seduce Anna .
556118	1406078	109456	6.0	Is it really Willis ' Willis ?	The director's cut , no pun intended , seems to be a much better film than the one that was shown commercially , but it still is a far cry from a satisfactory movie to watch . Richard Rush could have done better , but the psychological film we see , adds nothing to what has already been shown before . From the beginning we realize who the killer is , as well as the person with the multiple personality problem . It's too obvious ! The film relies heavily on the sexual attraction between Bill Capa and Rose . Much has been speculated in this forum about whether we are actually seeing Willis ' willis , or not . Since most male stars wouldn't be caught dead showing their genitals , for obvious reasons , what is seen for a second in the pool scene is that of a body double . On the other hand , we see Jane March showing it all , which is a welcome attraction . Only the final sequence has any impact . There are many things in the plot that don't add up and the viewer is ahead of the story at all times . Bruce Willis with a hairpiece looks good . Jane March has a better chance with the character she plays . Also Brad Dourif , Lance Henriksen have their moments . The one that doesn't come across well is Ruben Blades , an otherwise excellent actor trying to do a Columbo routine in this film .
555735	1406078	397101	6.0	Hoodoo in the Bayou	It's curious how in some Southern states the practice of voodoo , or in the case of " The Skeleton Key " , hoodoo , people don't seem to believe in the practice of these rites , yet , everyone is in awe of the magical powers behind these sort of religions . Voodoo , hoodoo , or even santeria , are religious practices brought from Africa from the poor black people that were forced into slavery , and continue to be practiced in some sort of variation , even today . That is the premise behind this film . A young health care worker , Caroline Ellis , arrives at what appears to be a haunted house in rural Louisiana . The man of the house , Ben Devereaux , has been stricken by a rare illness that is never specified , but it has made him weak and must be helped for everything by his young nurse . Ben is married to the strident Violet , a woman who seems to know much more than what she tells Caroline . For starters , there are no mirrors in the house , which is strange . Violet gives Caroline the master key , or ' skeleton key ' to the house , but warns her not to poke her nose into the attic . Well , it's just like telling Caroline : " Here , go and snoop in there " , which she does . What she finds really surprises her . The pictures she finds , together with all the other paraphernalia make Caroline suspect there is much more involved behind Ben's illness and Violet's apparent sweetness . To complicate things more , there is Luke Marshall , a young lawyer , who we meet at the beginning of the story , but who seems to be closer to Violet in more ways than one . Caroline will discover things she didn't imagine were there . In a surprising twist at the end , even Caroline can't help get more than what she bargained for when she decided to investigate what was wrong in the first place . Kate Hudson , as Caroline is perfect as the somewhat naive woman with an inquisitive mind . Gina Rowlands plays Violet Devereaux , who seems to hold not only the skeleton key , but she is the key for understanding what goes on in that spooky Southern mansion . John Hurt is seen briefly as the long suffering husband . Peter Sarsgaard appears as the sly lawyer who knows a lot more than he lets on . For lovers of the horror genre , director Iain Softley , has worked hard to involve the viewer in the story . Although a trifle slow at the beginning the director picks up the pace during the last part of the movie creating the necessary suspense to please the viewer .
555238	1406078	278504	6.0	Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz !	Insomnia almost put me to sleep !

Al Pacino is a candidate of a total makeover . Send him to the next session of Oprah so they can create a new image and a visit to a plastic surgeon should help out great Pacino continue for a long time as a hero on the big screen . There are 2 great things that happen in this film : Martin Donovan is seen in the first scenes and Robin Williams doesn't show his face until almost the last half of the film . That , together with the rainy atmosphere of Alaska started me , and a few others in the audience , yawning and falling asleep . Better luck next time Mr . Nolan . I wish you would find an original story to direct your next " memento " . . .
554933	1406078	412798	6.0	To the lighthouse	Rachel Carlson , who by the way was the name of a real novelist , lends her name to the character being played by Demi Moore in this film that seems to have " borrowed " different aspects of " Don't Look Now " and better made films of this genre as a vehicle for the star , an actress that shows to have no knack for choosing movie roles . After all , she deserves better . Unfortunately , the screen play by Craig Rosenberg , who also directed , doesn't make much sense . This seems to be a film that either the viewer loves it , as seems to be the case of most comments submitted to IMDb , or else hate it , as the other side seems to indicate . Our own experience was mixed . Demi Moore can be excellent with the right director behind her . Otherwise , she gives performances that will not add anything to her career . As a matter of fact , this film seems to have gone to DVD and cable right away , or at least , it has not garnered the wide audience the creators obviously wanted . There are some spooky elements in the film to get the viewer excited . It's just that as the film unfolds , it appears to be a case of deja vu . Or at least , we have figured it all out before it happens .
555224	1406078	486572	6.0	Man's best friend	Solo , a depressed young writer , is told by his analyst to get a dog ; this way , he will not feel as lonely . Little does he know that everyone he meets wants to have the dog ! Solo's life in Los Angeles is dull up until the time he decides to buy the dog in a shopping mall . Solo is not prepared for the work and the responsibility of owning a puppy , let alone trying to keep it to himself . This dark comedy was written and directed , as well as acted by Scott Caan . We were impressed by his " Dallas 362 " , his debut as a director . " The Dog Problem " shows a talented Scott Caan who no doubt will go to do better things , although this is not a movie for everyone since the material will be enjoyed by some audiences and hated by others . The best thing in the picture is , without a doubt , Giovanni Ribisi , who runs away with it . This actor keeps surprising us . He is not exactly a matinée idol , yet , he is always an interesting figure in any film in which participates . Scott Caan has a small role as a photographer . Lynn Collins , Mena Suvari , and the excellent Kevin Corrigan , are seen in minor roles .
554864	1406078	48764	6.0	The sunken treasure	Howard Hughes was a producer that had a lot of talent for discovering beautiful women that went on to have better careers with other vehicles than the ones he decided to create for them . That seems to be the case of this John Sturges ' 1955 film " Underwater ! " in which the curvaceous Jane Russell starred for the last time for Howard Hughes . The film is a curious one . We are introduced to Johnny and Dominic , two underwater divers who are searching for those sunken ships in the Caribbean , especially this one , not too far from Cuba . As they stumble into the old Spanish galleon , they find a man that appears to be a sort of pirate awaiting for them because it's obvious they are after those treasures . As Johnny and Dominic go back to Cuba , we are introduced to Theresa , Johnny's wife , who is dead set against spending money chasing his dreams . But when Dominic meets Gloria , by chance , she tells him about the yacht she has been left with by a departing old flame . So the four friends , and a priest who knows about those sunk ships , go in search of the riches trapped underwater . The film doesn't bring anything new to this film genre . In fact , it's pretty tame stuff we see in a predictable story we know how it will end . The best reward for the viewers of " Underwater " is the beautiful Jane Russell at her best . She was one of the sultriest women working in films during those days . The problem is the male stars who give by the numbers performances . Joseph Calleia is the only one that shows any spunk as the man who wants the riches from under the sea .
554770	1406078	335559	6.0	The Pigly Wigly girl	Even before the film started , one realizes where this film is going , so without any expectations , and nothing else good showing at the time this movie came on , we decided to take a chance . The film has some mildly funny moments . As directed by Robert Luketic , the movie shows no surprises , but it's amusing for a laugh , or two . The premise is ridiculous , at best . In fact , the movie makers have taken pains to present the people of West Virginia in a dignified way , contrary to what some comments here indicate . In fact , the cashier , Rosalee , has a lot going for her . The premise is completely false , but again , this is an attempt to make a romantic comedy . Rosalee finds out in the worst way , there's no place like home and real love is the one Pete feels for her . After all , he really knows what makes Rosalee tick , contrary to Tad Hamilton , the Hollywood " hunk " , who is only playing a role , which proves to be the case when his agents come calling him for the new picture where he will be the star . Kate Bosworth , as Rosalee , has some good moments . Topher Grace , who is a good actor , plays second fiddle to Josh Duhamel , the star of movies who thinks he might be in love . Nathan Lane and Sean Hayes have some funny moments too . This is a film that will seem better when the viewer realizes what it is , pure escape , formula entertainment , and sits back , relaxes and have a few laughs while watching it .
554625	1406078	71206	6.0	The dog star of the 70s	Every decade , or so it seems , Hollywood likes to build films around a cute dog . The early seventies was the era for " Benji " , whose real name was Higgins , an attractive and photogenic dog that had already had a recurring role in " Petticoat Junction " , the successful sitcom of the sixties . Edgar Buchanan , one of the stars from that show is on hand to act with an old pal again . Joe Camp , the director and screen writer , targeted this film toward a young audience of children under ten . Higgins and his trainer , Frank Inn , do wonders for the film . " Benji " shows a dog that has a natural intelligence and responds well to whatever it was asked to do . The film will delight young children . Some other faces in the movie are Frances Bavier , Deborah Walley , Patsy Garrett and others . Although the movie is predictable , let's not forget it was targeted for a young audience that will probably appreciate it more than the grown ups .
555324	1406078	35952	6.0	Ed Browne goes to Washington	Dudley Nichols , the director of " Government Girl " , working with Budd Schulberg on the script , gave us this look of America during the years of WWII . This is a move of how every department in Washington was taken over by thousands of women who descended on the capital to help with the war effort . The housing problem of the times is clearly shown as we watch the opening sequence when Ed Browne arrives in Washington without a reservation for a hotel . Because his name is in the newspaper , he is given the honeymoon suite that young Sgt . Blake and May , were going to use for that purpose . Smokey Allard comes to the rescue as she tries to give the couple a place where they can be together , but makes the mistake of taking them into the " only women " rooming house where she and May share a tiny apartment . This comedy shows us a slice of life in Washington in those years . Even though there was a war going on , there is always optimism , as that conflict was a just one , in the minds of all Americans of that era . We are shown how Ed Browne is instrumental in setting up the factories that will produce the bombers that were key in winning the war in Europe and in the Pacific . Olivia de Havilland makes a sunny " Smokey " Allard . Even when playing roles that didn't demand much of her acting abilities , this actress makes us like her because of the charisma she projected . Sunny Tufts is good as this unsophisticated Ed Browne who is mired in the bureaucracy he encounters in Washington . Ann Shirley , James Dunn , Paul Stewart , and Agnes Moorehead complete the excellent cast . While the movie doesn't break new ground , it's pleasant enough for a few laughs and a nostalgic look at that period .
555529	1406078	125879	6.0	Paul Auster directs	Some authors , as is the case with Paul Auster , can involve a reader with a novel . Mr . Auster , with a few exceptions , has produced a body of work that will be his legacy . Alas , this is not going to be the case of his directorial career . Like Julian Schnabel , a painter turned film director , Paul Auster seems to be a logical candidate for bringing his stories to the screen , but as proved by this effort , one hopes he keeps his day time job . The large , talented cast of " Lulu on the Bridge " can't overcome some of the problems the film presents . The mixture of a thriller with esoterica sounds like an intriguing idea for a film , but as one witness the movie unfolds it's clear these elements don't mix well together under the director's guidance with the screen play he wrote . The film has moments in which it transcends and shows a promise of working , but in the end , it's too contrived for its own good . Even an intense performer like Harvey Keitel is bogged down by a character that doesn't awake much interest in the viewer . Mira Sorvino is , in our humble opinion , terribly miscast . There is no chemistry between the two main characters . William Dafoe , Victor Argo , Vanessa Redgrave , Lou Reed , Gina Gershon are seen in minor roles .
555254	1406078	116908	6.0	A mind is a terrible thing to lose . . .	If one were to go along with Hollywood and the TV industry , there are more amnesiac people than what we thought were possible . This is a ploy that writers use a lot to present a story that could not be logically explained otherwise . I didn't see this film when it was originally released but caught it on cable . Renny Harlin , its director , is a product of Hollywood whose work includes more interesting tales than this one . The film is not helped by Shane Black unintelligible film treatment . Yes , we all understand that it's an action flick , but please , give us more credit to realize that most of what it's presented on the screen bears no resemblance with anything actual , or dreamt . The best thing in the film : Samuel L . Jackson . He is an actor that always delivers . As far as Geena Davis , I kept thinking about the Uma Thurman character in the Kill Bill saga . Obviously , this film came out before , so maybe it was an inspiration for Quentin Tarantino , who knows ? It's incredible that what Charlie / Samantha and Mitch went through , at the end of the movie they're in one piece and laughing all the way to the bank . No doubt they must have earned a bundle for appearing in this film as well as to what happens to them in it . Hooray for Hollywood ! With the exception of Craig Bierko , the rest of the actors are totally wasted . Brian Cox and David Morse don't have anything to do .
555199	1406078	257756	6.0	Haven't we seen this before ?	Director Carl Franklin should have stayed away from Joseph Finder's novel that is the basis for the film , or at least , he should have asked for a better adaptation . There is no originality in what we are watching . The characters come out as one dimensional . Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd have collaborated before , to better results . In this film the logic of the screen play needed a strong hand , or at least a reality check . We know from the beginning what's going to happen . There is no real suspense in the story and the way it turns out . James Caviezel , as Tom is the only one that has any opportunity to shine . Better luck next time .
555914	1406078	33024	6.0	Boy , oh boy , oh boy !	This copy of this film , seen recently on TCM , had a faded look , which contributes to lose the viewer's interest in a film that doesn't seem too relevant today . The main attraction for watching it , was the interesting cast put together for it . Unfortunately , the most important part , is terribly miscast . The story takes place in Manhattan at the end of the Great Depression . Based on a play by Maxwell Anderson , it probably worked better on the stage than in the adaptation that Julius Epstein , one of the best writers of the period , gave it . It doesn't help either , that director Vincent Sherman didn't appear to be too enthused with the material , as evident in the finished product . John Garfield was totally wrong for Rims Rosson . He doesn't have that spark that was his trade mark . In the film he is just too bland . Ann Shirley plays the sweet Bobby Halevy . Claude Rains , though , is about the most likable character in the film because as the father of Bobby , he is an honest man who wants to do everything possible to guarantee his daughter's happiness . The supporting cast is excellent . Lee Patrick , is seen as Florrie . Roscoe Karns and the always dependable George Tobias , make good contributions in minor roles . Watch " Saturday's Children " as dated curiosity piece .
556377	1406078	808237	6.0	Adrift in Acapulco	The mere idea that Mexican actors , Diego Luna and Gabriel Garcia Bernal were involved with " Drama / Mex " , was the main reason for watching this film written and directed by Gerardo Naranjo . This is , in many ways a movie that evokes better made ones by the likes of Alejandro Gonzales Inurritu , or Alfonso Cuaron , who have elevated the quality of Mexican cinema to new heights . " Drama / Mex " seems to have been a project of love on the part of everyone involved in it . The result feels like a cross between cinema-variete and a road picture , as we are taken along to meet a group of unconnected seedy characters that populate the lower depths of Acapulco . The film , with its two different narratives can be confusing at times if one doesn't pay attention of what is going on . What Mr . Naranjo has accomplished is to create an atmosphere of people in turmoil where he sets his characters to live and play . Best of all , Fernando Becerril , a solid actor who conveys the anguish Jaime is going through . This is a tormented soul and Mr . Becerril gives a nuanced performance . Among the young players , who might be non-professional , Diana Garcia , who is seen as Fernanda , shows a promise . Also Miriana Moro , as a young prostitute , and Emilio Valdes make valuable contributions . One can expect better things from Mr . Naranjo in the future .

Having found a bag containing a lot of money , he returned it to the police , something that was considered a stupid thing to do by an element in the society that wouldn't have batted an eyelash in keeping the money , had the situation involved them . The story starts at the airport in Santiago , where we watch everybody beating Anselmo to prospective customers right under his nose . Anselmo observes a mysterious young woman with a small child . While she makes a phone call , the little boy goes stealing candy from a shop . Little does he know that he is about to embark in the biggest adventure of his life , when Eva , who has arrived in Santiago for unknown business , hires him to take her and the little boy to a place downtown . Adrian , the little boy , is left in Anselmo's care against his will , as Eva promises to pay him well for his effort . The only problem Anselmo has is how can he explain the boy's presence in his apartment to Sandra , a neighbor , who is his secret love . There's one problem though , Sandra is engaged to be married to Anselmo's best friend ! Boris Quercia , the writer-director of this sunny comedy , works hard in front , and in back of the camera in order to entertain his audience . His take on this loser , is right on the money . In a society where men are supposed to be a step ahead of the game , the gentle Anselmo seems out of place . Little Diego Hurtado has some great moments in the film as does Tamara Acosta , the sweet Sandra , who realizes how sexually starved this lonely man is .
555200	1406078	390221	7.0	Coming to America	Joshua Marston has created a film that is disturbing , as well as positive in trying to condemn the illegal traffic of drugs . This movie should be a warning to would be ' mules ' to think about it twice before embarking into a trip that could well land them in jail , away from family in a foreign country , or even dead . SpoilersMaria , in the film appears to be not dealing with reality . On the one hand , she wants to improve her life , but on the other she finds that after getting her share of the money for transporting the drugs , she doesn't have one iota of remorse about the criminal act she has committed . Obviously , in her mind she justifies the end because of what she had to go through . Of course , the problem that she faces is the threat the drug people tell her about what they'd do to her family back in Colombia , which , would be a deterrent for these young people to come forward and accuse the higher ups . We never get to see in detail what happened to Lucy , the friend who dies when a pellet bursts inside her . This is the danger the " mules " face in transporting the drugs . We hear repeatedly about deaths in the news of people who don't make it to the end . It is a horrible death . Maria deceives Carla and her husband in order to get shelter in New York when she goes with Blanca to visit her under the pretext that Lucy had sent her to say hello . Maria shows a sophistication , rare for a girl that is from a rural area of Colombia . She is a survivor . Catalina Sandino Moreno is a young woman of dark beauty . The camera loves her ; she is a natural . Her take on Maria is right . Also excellent is Patricia Rae , as Carla . This kind woman opens the door to her home just because she is a friend of her sister . Guilied Lopez , also is good as Lucy . This is an eye opener and a cautionary film that must be seen by anyone that is considering being a mule .
555029	1406078	39337	7.0	Terpsichore and the Muses	Alexander Hall , the director of " Here Comes Mr . Jordan " , tried to give his old movie a new look by changing it into a musical . It must have sounded like a good idea at the times . The only problem was that this is not as charming as the model in which " Down to Earth " is based on . While the model picture seemed light and inspired , this one doesn't fare as well . In theory , Larry Parks and Rita Hayworth , would have been a match made in heaven . Both were at the top of their fame . Larry Parks was a good actor who could act and sing as well and Rita Hayworth was a joy to watch , no matter in what vehicle . Somehow , the sparks both actors should have given their fans don't materialize , perhaps because of the way it unfolds on the screen . There are some unexpected pleasures in the film , although not the unremarkable music . On the other hand , Rita Hayworth is quite good as the Muse who decides to take matters on her own and comes back to show Danny Miller how to stage his musical for the theater . Ms . Hayworth is at her most ravishing self dressed by Jean Louis and looking like the goddess she was ! Larry Parks tries to be the suave musical theater man that falls in love with his Terpsichore . The supporting cast is excellent . James Gleason , who played in the original film , here is seen as a theatrical agent . Roland Culver is the Mr . Jordan , who arranges the trip down to earth . The incomparable Edward Everett Horton is seen as the guardian angel , or Messenger 7013 , who is made to follow Terpsichore / Kitty provoking some funny situations . William Frawley plays a small part . This is a film to watch to see the gorgeous Rita Hayworth as the top of her profession .
556279	1406078	87751	7.0	Kate Soffel	Kate Soffel , the wife of the Allegheny County jail warden , is a woman whose married life appears to be lacking the warmth and love that might have brought her together with Peter Soffel , in the first place . When we first meet her , she appears weak , recovering from an unknown ailment . She is willing to continue her Christian work , distributing bibles to the inmates in her husband's jail . She gets interested in Ed Biddle , a handsome young criminal who is serving time , together with his brother , Jack . It's easy to see why this meek and somewhat shy woman falls deeply in love with the prisoner . He is what her husband is not . When Ed Biddle asks her to help them escape , she is happy to comply . In her mind , Ed represents freedom from her dull life . Kate , who appears to be a loving mother , doesn't mind throwing all away when she falls in love . Nothing goes right as the plan is put in practice . Kate , Ed and Jack are doomed from the start ; in the few days she spends time with her new lover , Kate finds a bliss she never knew . She throws away all her responsibilities aside to go with the brothers into an unknown territory , hoping to escape to Canada . In the end , Kate is alone as she must pay for her actions . Gillian Armstrong , a feminist director , seems attracted to strong female characters , as it's the case in this picture . This is a story based on a true incident in the Pittsburgh of the beginning of the 20th Century . Although Ms . Armstrong has succeeded in presenting interesting women , her Kate Soffel , seems the right person to bring to the screen since she has a personality that recalls other strong women the director has examined before . Diane Keaton , an actress whose choice of roles in comedies , and light fare , have been her trademark , here shows a range most viewers didn't know she had . As Mrs . Soffel , she is full of lust and a passion that only a criminal , Ed Biddle , awakens in her . Ms . Keaton's work is the best excuse to see the film . Mel Gibson is effective as the criminal Ed Biddle in one of his rare dramatic roles . Matthew Modine gives a restrained performance . Edward Herrmann , Trini Alvarado , Jennifer Dundas , Terry O'Quinn , Maury Chaykin , are seen among the supporting roles . " Mrs . Soffel " came and went without much fanfare , but it's worth a look because of the powerful combination of Gillian Armstrong and Diane Keaton and the interesting cinematography by Russell Boyd .
555225	1406078	841044	7.0	They'll always have Paris	Julie Delpy , the talented actress of " 2 Days in Paris " surprises with this tale of a pair of lovers at a crucial moment of their relationship . Ms . Delpy , who wrote and directed the film shows how well she has learned the lessons of being in front of the camera . The end result is a delightful film that owes a lot to previous films where she has appeared . Throughout the movie one felt the presence of Richard Linkletter , who directed her in two films that bear some resemblance to this one , and Woody Allen , in the way Ms . Delpy presents the character of Jack , her lover of two years . Jack , a New York neurotic , feels out of his usual turf . In a way , he is totally overwhelmed by the life Marion , his girlfriend , has left behind for a life in America . Julie Delpy plays Marion wearing thick black eyeglasses that hide her beautiful face in a way we are not used to see her in movies . She plays the straight part against the goofy Jack of Adam Goldberg . Mr . Goldberg has some good moments when he is at his nastiest , like with the group of tourists he misdirects in order to get ahead of them in the taxi queue . One hopes Ms . Delpy will come with another film in a not too distant future for she shows a natural ability to set a pleasant story in an enjoyable way .
556059	1406078	47956	7.0	Those airmen in their flying machines	Otto Preminger was perhaps honing his skills as a director , because this film seems to be a dress rehearsal for his greatest achievement , " Anatomy of a Murder " , which is a classic of the courtroom drama genre . The movie is interesting in that it presents a man of honor , Billy Mitchell , who not only was an aviation pioneer , but a visionary that pointed out to the future in uncanny ways . He realized that wars were going to be fought in the air , and that soon the world would shrink thanks to faster planes than the primitive two engine jobs he was flying during WWI . Billy Mitchell was an outcast , rejected by the same people that were too obtuse to realize the upcoming revolution in aeronautics . In trying to prove a point , Billy is found guilty and tried for disobeying orders . It's a sad story in which a highly developed mind , like Billy's has to contend with the ignorance of his peers . Testimony from other leading figures of the time , such as Eddie Rickenbacker , and others speak volumes about Mitchell's incredible insight on the new technology and how vulnerable America was from air raids by enemies . Gary Cooper's approach to the role doesn't clarify much about the real life Mitchell . He is not quite as effective as in many of his most outstanding films . Somehow we don't get any passion out of his character , where perhaps another actor would have run away with the role . Mr . Cooper's take on Mitchell , or perhaps Otto Preminger's direction , doesn't shed much insight in the character . The best thing in the movie is Rod Steiger as Allan Gullion , who is brought to the trial to help the main prosecution officer . He steals the picture in his short time in front of the camera . Mr Steiger brings a different concept to this officer ; he stands out against all the other people around him . What a presence he had ! In contrast with Mr . Cooper's stoic presence , Mr . Steiger was ready to smolder the screen if given the chance . The rest of the cast is outstanding . Charles Bickford , Ralph Bellamy , Elizabeth Montgomery , Jack Lord , James Daly , Fred Clark , among others , enhance this movie . The only problem with the copy I saw , is the horrible coloring that tends to give a fading images . This is a film in need of restoration .
555355	1406078	248190	7.0	The monster speaks !	Hal Hartley is an original film maker . With this film , which I recently saw in DVD form , he presents us a modern day parable about the media an its influence on our lives . It's curious to see how ahead of his times Mr . Hartley is when he deals with paranoia , even before the attacks of , in his own subtle way . It was not intentional , I'm sure , but he proves to have a keen eye for what was coming . The film is not one of Mr . Hartley's best , but we see his sure hand behind all what he is trying to do here . He is working with a cast that is working with him for the first time , with the exception of Robert John Burke , the Monster . Sarah Polley , is one of the best actresses working in movies these days . Her Beatrice is a study in contrasts . Also excellent , as always , is Helen Mirren , Beatrice's boss who is ruthless , arrogant , and manipulative . She knows the secret of how to get attention in the worst possible ways . Julie Christie makes a rare appearance as a kind doctor who befriends Beatrice . The scenery in Iceland is magnificent and Mr . Hartley captures it brilliantly .
555919	1406078	317132	7.0	A girl and her dog	Opal , the daughter of a preacher , is a girl with a mind of her own . When she meets Winn-Dixie , she has found a pal . Her father is a man that is in pain . He is trying to reconcile himself to his present circumstances . Arriving at the small southern town , he must do good work in order to attract a faithful congregation . He doesn't have much to fear , just leave it Opal to get everyone together in a place where people have grown apart . The great book by Kate DiCamillo , is an excellent book for young adults . Joan Singleton adapted it for the screen and Wayne Wang directed a nice cast that produced a movie that , while some would think it's too sugary for their taste , it captured perfectly the essence of a small southern town . The sweet AnnaSophia Robb plays the leading role . This young actress is a natural , or so it seems . Jeff Daniels , one of our best actors is seen as the preacher who can't forget his wife and who has to come to terms with himself . Cicely Tyson and Eva Maria Saint are perfect as two of the town's oldest citizens that are won over by Opal's goodness . Elle Fanning is seen as Sweetie Pie , a lovely girl . B . J . Hopper and Dave Mathews also contributed to the film . This film was clearly targeted for young audiences . It has the right ingredients that prove to be a magical combination for family movies , a girl and a cute dog , a sure formula for appealing to audiences . Wayne Wang , an unlikely choice for director , brings all these elements together for a film that will not disappoint .
554762	1406078	96003	7.0	The last viking	Daniel Petrie's " Rocketship Gibraltar " was shown recently on cable . It is an elegiac tribute , in many ways , to the great Burt Lancaster , whose last movie this was . The film's message seems to be telling us how impressionable children are as they interpret facts told by a grandfatherly figure . When we first meet Levi Rockwell , he appears not to be well . His upcoming birthday is the occasion for a family reunion . We watch as the clan descends to the patriarch's home in Long Island . The adults are all self-absorbed in their own little dramas . The eight grandchildren take the occasion for reacquainting themselves with Levi . In turn , the grandfather tells them his views on dying and how he would love to be buried at sea , which he loves more than anything in the world . The film last sequence is amazing , as we see the children take charge of the situation . Burt Lancaster is fine . It seems he must have known his own end was near as we watch him looking mistily toward a family that love him , but are somehow distant . The children , especially a sweet Macauley Culkin , are delightful to watch because being so young , they still know of malice , and other evils they will learn later on . The film is sad and uplifting at the same time . We , in turn feel grateful Levi , the great writer has been given his last wishes .
555701	1406078	307507	7.0	The ATM	Rowdy Herrington's " The Stickup " turned out to be a surprise when it turned up recently on cable . Not having seen it before , we decided to take a chance , which paid up because of the interesting work the director gets out of the star of the film , James Spader . " The Stickup " makes a case for appearing to be something on the surface , while being something else in reality . John Parker , the cop that decides to take a trip up north to clear his head knows about the corruption in his own department and feels horrible about the death of his good partner during a stake out in L . A . When we see him at the beginning of the film bleeding at a church , little do we know what he has been involved in . For all appearances , John has robbed the bank and has gotten away with all the money . An FBI agent is assigned to the case ; he is an inexperienced young man who appears not to have a clue of what he is doing , but by looking to clues in the video tape about the bank heist , he will solve the mystery . The film is greatly helped by James Spader , who as John Parker is the best thing in the movie . Leslie Stefanson , is Natalie , the nurse who believes in Parker even when all the evidence points out to his guilt . David Keith is perfectly obnoxious as the sheriff . " The Stickup " is a small film that packs a great punch !
554690	1406078	303120	7.0	You're mine alone !	Domestic violence is perhaps more prevalent than one realizes . People caught in this situation often don't have the guts to confront reality and never leave the relationship soon enough to gain their sanity . This film , directed by Javier Balaguer , was shown recently on cable and since it paired Sergi Lopez , perhaps Spain's best movie actor , and Paz Vega , got my attention . The situation presented here is a study on how Joaquin , an up and coming advertising executive meets and falls in love with the lovely Angela . One can see from the beginning this relationship is doomed . Joaquin takes out all his frustrations on Angela and beats her up on many occasions until Angela walks out . The best part of the film is the surprising twist we witness at the end . We realize that justice works in mysterious ways , but it finally arrives and Angela is a winner . Sergi Lopez is excellent as Joaquin . This actor has an intelligence that keeps amazing his fans from one film to next . Paz Vega is a beautiful , but resolute Angela . Elvira Minguez plays the pivotal role of Andrea , Angela's best friend , with conviction .
555106	1406078	104765	7.0	Three for the road	" Love Field " was a film that came and went without much fanfare . It was shown on cable recently , so we decided to take a chance with it . Jonathan Kaplan makes an impression with his unusual take on the subject of the race relations in the United States of the early 60s that pays a great deal of respect to the era in which it takes place . The film shows how things were in this country in the years where segregation was still enforced in the land . If you haven't watched the movie , please stop reading now . Lurene , the young woman at the center of the story was in awe of Mrs . Jacqueline Kennedy . The former first lady had such magnetic quality and charisma that it was easy to see why she was so admired and imitated by all women in America in the early 60s . After all , Mrs . Kennedy was royalty in a country that supposedly has no class differences . Jackie's sense of style was imitated by most women ; after all , she was an elegant , vibrant and youthful woman who all wanted to adore . The story presents a situation that rings false from the beginning . Lurene was only a step above of what would be considered white trash , therefore , her relationship with Paul Cater and Jonell , is hard to believe because of the woman's background . Lurene is kind hearted , but one wonders to what extend would someone in her station in life would have done in a real situation like the director presents in the picture . As far as what we watch in the film , making allowances for Lurene's open mind and understanding about segregation and discrimination , the movie is easy to watch . In pairing Michelle Pfeiffer with a handsome Dennis Haysbert , who has already been seen in a similar role in " Far from Heaven " , one can see why these two lost souls were attracted to one another . We can understand Lurene's sense of decency , as well as Paul's falling for Lurene when reason and logic would tell him to stay away from this white woman . Even in the big Northern cities where racial discrimination was not as blatant as in the deep South , integrated couples were a rarity in the early 60s . Michelle Pfeiffer makes a compelling Lurene , the girl who is a decent human being . This role is a stretch for Ms . Pfeiffer , an actress not associated with dramatic parts that make such demands on her . Dennis Haysbert is good as the troubled Paul , a man that only wants to do his best for this daughter he is bringing back to Philadelphia . Stephanie McFadden is sweet as the young girl who can't comprehend what's going on around her . Finally , Louise Latham , as Mrs . Enright , is the only one that shows any decency to the situation in which she gets involved against her will . While the movie doesn't break any grounds in racial relations , at least it has the courage to show how wrong segregation was and how prevalent it was in the United States .
554800	1406078	347607	7.0	But is it art ?	The subject of this wonderful documentary , Spencer Tunick , was a surprise when it was shown on cable recently . The controversial artist is seen in an uncanny account of the way he works by the director of the film , Arleene Donnelly Nelson . We watch as the photographer travels to different countries in order to capture in film humans that pose against impressive backgrounds naked . Mr . Tunick speaks candidly about his ideas and how he goes about it . In interviews we see some of his subjects discussing before hand their ideas and reservations . It's surprising that Mr . Tunick is able to get the hundreds of people to pose for him " en masse " without so much of a problem . His shoot in front of the Cutty Sark , a London landmark , is one of the best pictures we see in the film . At the same time , it surprises how the Parisian guards of the Louvre come after him when he tried to photograph a naked man in the museum's courtyard with the I . M . Pei pyramid in the background . We are shocked , in a way , because if anyone , in our minds , should be more understanding , would be the French ! The pictures are not pornographic at all ! We see ordinary people posing nude , but there is no desire whatsoever to project anything sexual to the would be viewer , in any way . The people posing for Mr . Tunick do so out of their own free will , as no one is pressured to do otherwise . After watching the film , we get an understanding of the artist and his vision .
555553	1406078	78481	7.0	Promises promises	Robert Altman's " A Wedding " was shown recently on cable . Having seen it when it was first released , I was curious as to how it kept after all these years . Being an admirer of Mr . Altman's work , it was worth watching again , although the movie seems a bit too long on second viewing . Mr . Altman brings two families into a formal wedding that are as dissimilar as oil and water . The groom's family is old money and the bride's is new money , perhaps , although the latter one seem to be out of place . The immediate reaction is : why are these two people marrying ? Frankly , it makes no sense , at all . We are treated to a wedding reception from hell ! The wedding party as well as some of the few guests that attend the reception are an odd lot indeed . Logic would indicate that if a wedding is at the center of the story , the bride and the groom should be more prominently focused , but this being an Altman film , they are not as important as the people around them . There is the old matriarch with no sense of time , at all ! Then there is the old bishop that might be in the beginning states of dementia . The old family doctor who likes to touch all females ' breasts . We have a wedding planner who has no sense of style . The mother of the bride is swept off her feet by the uncle of the groom in a hysterical sequence . The sister of the bride also had relations with the groom and his class at the military academy ! We get to spy on most conversations . Mr . Altman makes us silent witnesses to what is going on behind the scenes . This is his device for telling his story ; he lets us hear snippets of conversation to get an idea of what is really going on . " A Wedding " is a minor Altman . Somehow this story doesn't grab the viewer the same way as some of his best pictures , but it's a fun ride all the same . At the end we have learned the secrets of the two families and frankly , most of it was not that interesting . That is why , perhaps , this movie , although it tries , never found a wider audience when it came out in 1978 . This film is for Altman fans , mainly .
556138	1406078	60645	7.0	Missing mother	Holly Parker , a beautiful woman , is married to an up and coming politician with a bright future ahead of him . Holly , who is bored with her husband being away from home so much , becomes the lover of Phil Benton , a playboy , who wants her for himself . Holly , realizes her error and goes to break up with Phil , but a terrible accident happens where he ends falling to his own death in his apartment . Thanks to her conniving mother-in-law , who realizes she's a liability for her son's political career , Holly is given a choice she can't refuse , a new identity and money , in exchange for her supposed death by drowning . What follows is Holly's adventure as a single woman who misses her son terribly , but one that knows she can't go back to her old life . An aristocratic pianist , Christian Torben , wants Holly , but she can't commit to his life style , and what follows is her own descent to hell when she drowns her sorrows in absinthe , a potent drink she loves . She ends up in Mexico where the scheming Don Sullivan discovers who she really is ; he tries to blackmail her , but she is determined not to have her identity revealed to her former husband , or the son she loved more than anything else . The final section of the movie is a court trial in which , her own son , Clayton Anderson Jr . , is an assistant D . A . assigned to defend her . During the trial Clayton Anderson Sr . and his mother come to see the young man in action , but they can't connect this defeated woman to Holly . Holly gets to know the identity of her young lawyer at the end . This melodrama was a vehicle for Lana Turner , who saw in it a great opportunity in which to excel . Directed by David Lowell Rich , it follows the star from a glamorous beginning to a tragic end . The only problem was that Ms . Turner's co-star , Constance Bennett , looked as young as her own daughter-in-law in the early scenes . As Neil Doyle has pointed out in his commentary , Ms . Bennett , a veteran actress , had undergone plastic surgery herself , making her look better than the star . The other major flaw of this version is one of credibility . Even though Holly is supposed to have aged with her heavy drinking , she looks about the same , so it's a surprise when the old Mrs . Anderson herself , who is in court all the time can't even recognize Holly , or for that matter , Old Clayton himself doesn't seem to know this woman was his beloved wife . But that's the stuff that makes this type of story what they are . " Madame X " is what it is : a tear jerker at its best . They don't come any better than this , so don't see it without the tissues !
554539	1406078	71622	7.0	Tavernier and Simenon	Bernard Tavernier once confessed that the greatest influence in his life had been the work of directors Akira Kurosawa and Michael Powell . This might explain his direction of the film based in the novel by Georges Simenon's . It shows a Tavernier more concerned with the character study of M . Descombes , as he goes through the horror of understanding what had caused his son to commit the crime of which he is been accused of perpetrating . In doing so , M . Tavernier embraces the " old French cinema " , as he shuns away the New Wave methods of story telling . One can see clearly what's going on in Descombes ' mind , at all time . His son has grown up and is not a child anymore . We see this father come home and encounters newspaper reporters and he goes into his son's room and lays down in the bed that perhaps the younger man has not slept in for quite some time . We watch as Descombs descends into hell because he can't comprehend what has triggered his son into doing what seems repugnant to him and his dignity . Pilippe Noiret was born to play Descombes . This actor with such subtlety , underplays the clockmaker , and the father . What comes to the surface is the inner turmoil that Descombes is experiencing . This is another example of how good an actor M . Noiret is because with an economy of gestures he builds the character . Jean Rochefort , as the inspector , is also good . M . Rochefort is another actor that always surprises . This movie is a psychological portrait of a man at the crossroads of despair . Only at the end , father and son seem reconciled with one another . The city of Lyons has been photographed lovingly in this film . This is a Tavernier for discriminating tastes .
555699	1406078	366287	7.0	Peer pressure in the big city	Paolo Virzi's " Caterina va in citta " is a film where he decided to throw his own personal take in the Italian society of the present . Mr . Virzi is a director of talent . In this film , he decides to give us a disarming heroine , Caterina , who is at the center of two opposing factions , the left and the right . At the beginning of the film we meet Giancarlo Iacovani , who is a teacher in a northwest coastal town , perhaps in Tuscany . He is telling his boring students how he has hated them for making his life miserable while trying to teach them something , as he is bailing out to his native Rome , where he is finally been transferred . His daughter Caterina , the intense and earnest teen ager , is seen practicing in the chorus and she gets carried away singing the beautiful music she adores . She appears not too keen on the moving to Rome . The area where they are moving to seems to be a place where chaos reigns and where the apartments are so close to one another that the young girls can see all what's going on with all the neighbors across the street . As Caterina is going to start classes , a proud Giancarlo , is seen taking her to her first day of school at the same one where he has gone himself , years before . The class Caterina joins is an unruly place where the young people are clearly from two different factions , those with money and right wing sympathizers , or those with money but left wingers leaning into communism . Caterina is made feel unwelcome for sticking out as she doesn't belong with one group , or the other . Upon going home from the first day of school and showing her father Giancarlo the names of her classmates , he becomes impressed because most of the students seem to be connected to who's who in Rome ! Caterina is accepted first by Margherita , the rebel with left wing parents . Caterina learns this girl has gotten rid of her father's manuscript , which he had sent to Margherita's mother , an editor . Then , Daniela , the leader of the opposite faction , takes her under her wing and sophisticates her appearance . At the end , Caterina realizes Daniella is no friend either . The affection that Daniela's cousin shows to Caterina is thwarted when her snobbish mother makes a point to tell him to stop seeing the provincial girl . The film keeps a fast pace that works for the movie . It seems that Mr . Virzi parallels the life in Rome to what we are seeing . The city , alas , has the wrong effect in Giancarlo , who is suspended from his teaching post and as he tries to fight for it , he is made aware he doesn't amount to anything and decides to take off on his own after he fixes his old motorcycle . It is clear at this point that Agata , the long suffering wife , has had it with his ups and downs as she finds solace with Fabietto , the kind bachelor friend . The best thing in the film is Alice Teghil , who , as Caterina , is seen exploring new things that ultimately can't compare with the life she had in the small town she came from , with all its problems and small mindedness . Sergio Castellito plays the strident Giancarlo , a man that comes unglued in pursuing his dream of returning to the capital with little success once he is there . Margherita Buy , a beautiful actress , has little to do as Agata , the long suffering wife of Giancarlo . She is the only sane person we encounter in the film . As the bad girls , Carolina Iaquaniello , is the grungy-Italian-style-like Margherita , the girl grown among the intellectual crowd . Federica Sberema , plays Daniela , the rich girl who is a mess and who moves with a fast crowd . The supporting cast do a good job . The best part is the ending in which we watch the radiant Caterina doing what she does best : singing to her heart's content !
554541	1406078	331701	7.0	The trip to Spain	Carol , the young girl at the center of the story , is transplanted to a foreign land , Spain , at the height of the Civil War conflict in the late 30s . For this girl , everything is new , in it's foreignness . The war and her father are her constant worries , while she has to immerse herself in a provincial culture that is years behind what she has in New York . Imanol Uribe directs this film by the numbers . Carol's family is obviously divided , while Carol's mother is married to someone that is an air force pilot with the leftist faction , the rest of the family's sympathies are with the Franco and the fascists that won the conflict . The story adds nothing to what has already been told , much better , but it's an easy film to watch . Northern Spain's magnificent landscape is shown . Don't expect a lot of action since most of what happens revolves around Carol and the young boys she befriends . Clara Lago plays Carol with sincerity and innocence . Maria Barranco is Carol's mother Aurora , the one that went away to America . Rosa Maria Sarda is Maruja , the teacher who befriends Carol . Carmelo Gomez , plays Alfonso , the man that Aurora left behind when she left for America . This actor , who usually has lead roles in most Spanish films , doesn't have anything to do , as he remains an enigma throughout the movie .
554829	1406078	323741	7.0	Detour to hell	" Purgatory Flats " , shown on cable recently , is a small movie that packs a lot . Harris Done directs with style . The screen play by Mr . Done and Diane Fine makes a good thriller . If you haven't seen the film , perhaps you would like to stop reading . The film is the story about a young L . A . doctor that made a mistake and lives to pay for it . Upon being released from prison he wants to hide in a small town where he feels he will be forgotten . Bad choice ! What Thomas Reed finds in Purgatory Flats is hell in the desert . Right after landing a job as a bar tender , Thomas meets a pretty young woman , Sunny , who , clearly is someone to stay away from . The young doctor is called to help as Sunny's boyfriend Randy , is gunned down by a drug dealer . We get to know Randy's family . His uncle Dean appears to be OK , but his brother Owen is a loose cannon . Every one in the household is connected in more ways than one to the nubile Sunny . The performances are fine . Vincent Ventresca is Thomas , the man who should have gone to his L . A . practice instead of making a detour to the small town . Alexandra Holden is Sunny , a young woman with a tremendous ambition to escape her surroundings . Kevin Alejandro , Gregg Henry , Brian Austin play the men in the Mecklin family well . Nicholas Turturro makes also a good contribution as the drug dealer . The film shows a director with promise who will go far judging from this tightly constructed film .
555307	1406078	361620	7.0	The President's daughter	The main interest in watching " First Daughter " was to see this directing effort by Forest Whitaker , an original actor , who also was at the helm of " Hope Floats " and " Waiting to Exhale " , previously . Mr . Whitaker seems to be having great fun with this project , which centers around the daughter of an incumbent President of the USA that is starting college . The premise lends itself for a lot of unusual situations . Also , the fact that Katie Holmes was playing the principal role was a deciding factor . Ms . Holmes is one of the most versatile young actresses working in films these days , as she has shown in other films . The result is a film that falls somehow into the formula type of movie because it doesn't show anything new , but it's a pleasant way to spend an hour and forty minutes in good company . It won't bore the viewer and there are moments when some sparks of originality from the director can be seen . The only thing we would question is the way Mr . Whitaker and his choreographer , Miranda Garrison , staged the two dancing numbers , first between Samantha and James , then between the President and his daughter . It's the same number , but there is no spontaneity in it . In fact , in both occasions they seem to be following a programmed dance , rather than just dancing for the joy of it . Katie Holmes does a good job as Samantha . Marc Blucas is James , her love interest . Michael Keaton , looking rather old , ( maybe is the makeup to make him look an older statesman ) and Margaret Colin play the first couple and Amerie Rogers is Mia , Samnatha's funny roommate .
554733	1406078	359045	7.0	Bear cubs	It appears to be a trend in the cinema by presenting the " bear " gay subculture . We already saw it in John Waters ' " Dirty Shame " in the summer , although it's not the main idea of that picture . Of course , the John Waters ' movie has nothing to do with Luis Miguel Albaladejo's superior film where we are presented with the Spanish version of this sub group of the gay culture where overweight men , usually hairy and cuddly tend to get together in bars , or other places where they can feel comfortable with one another . In a way , it's a refreshing way to watch a film like this one that deals with that type of individuals , as they are presented leading normal lives without any hangups or other moral problems . In fact , the dialog is quite explicit as the people in the movie are not ashamed of their sexual preference and even those that aren't gay , keep an open mind about what is going on with Pedro , the man at the center of the story . We get to know Pedro and his circle of friends . They all are normal people and well adjusted . Pedro is a loving man facing the dilemma of being a role model for his nephew , who has come into his life quite suddenly and without warning . Bernardo , the young boy , is wiser for his years as we get to know him better . This youngster , while being curious about his uncle's love life , is never a brat , as he takes everything in stride . The film is a lot of fun for those that will watch it with open eyes . They will be rewarded to a fun time with a touch of reality at the end .
555497	1406078	436078	8.0	The punch line !	" The Aristocrats " , the hilarious documentary directed by Paul Provenza , and produced by , among others , Penn Jilette , is one of the funniest things about American stand up comedy , period ! Mr . Provenza was able to amass some of the best exponents of this typical form of entertainment in which the classic joke is reinterpreted by whoever happens to be on the screen at any given moment . Granted , this film is not for everyone who might object to be a witness a gross joke being told the way it's supposed to be told . It's a credit to Mr . Provenza and everyone involved in this project not to stray from the joke itself in all its exaggerated detail . " The Aristocrats " is an excellent documentary that will be appreciated by all fans of comedy . The film is laugh riot because it comes out naturally with what appears to be an improvisational style . The joke being told for our benefit by some of the best talent performing today in this country .
556208	1406078	382691	8.0	Dangerous liaison	What can a woman do when she finds out her husband is having an affair with her own sister ? Not much , according to this account , set in a small town in Belgium in the forties . Elisa is the model of a perfect wife who makes the discovery , but because of her circumstances , she can't do much in order to stop Gilles to see Victorine , her younger and beautiful sister . Elisa finds herself in a position to go along with her discovery , and not to confront Gilles , at the beginning . Seeking help , Eliza turns to her church , where she confesses what her husband is doing , only to be spoken down by the priest who seems to take the straying husband's part ! Then , afraid of losing Gilles , after she finds herself pregnant and not having any money of her own , she accepts Gilles ' status quo as a solution to her problems . In a surprise turn of events , Victorine finds a new suitor who appears to have means to support her in moderate comfort . Gilles is desperate because of his passion for the young woman and confesses his guilt to Elisa , who is so glad , thinking her problems are over . Just when everything seems to be getting back to normal we receive a shock watching Elisa's delayed outrage take shape . " La Femme de Gilles " is a small and intimate film directed with sure hand by Frederic Fonteyne , who also wrote the screen play . Mr . Fonteyne shows great promise because he clearly understands what his characters are thinking at all times . His narrative is simple , but yet , it leaves us with images that haunt us because the way he involved us in absorbing his film . Emmanuelle Devos , one of the best French actresses of her generation , gives a tour de force performance in the film . In fact , Ms . Devos is seen in basically all the frames of the movie . As Elisa , the actress gives her life and acts with such an intelligence that it's hard for the viewer to take his eyes away from this troubled woman who is a gentle soul that doesn't deserve what life has given her . She is a kind woman whose love for her twins and the infant son is easy to see . She is a loyal woman who feels betrayed by a husband that clearly doesn't appreciate her and who doesn't care about bringing shame to his household and to his in-law's . The other two excellent performances are by Clovis Cronillac , who as Gilles , shows a perfect take on this man that strays because of the lust he feels for Victorine . Laura Smet , the beautiful Victorine , is also right for the part . " La Femme de Gilles " is a film one recommend highly because of the work of Mr . Fonteyne and the exquisite Emmanuelle Devos .
555725	1406078	35093	8.0	A rose by any other name . . .	William Wyler , one of the great directors of the American cinema , had the perfect team when he decided to make this film . Mr . Wyler was in a class by himself . He has given the movie going public pictures such as this one that will live forever , as new audiences discover them through cable and late shows on television . The film , a product of Hollywood in the 40s , has an underside that is done very subtly when it takes the cause for going to war into the noble and just cause that the American public believed it to be . Therefore , we are shown the valor , the idea of a better world and victory for the just , as a matter of course . Kay Miniver is a charming woman living in the country , not too far from London , where we see her go shopping . As the story unfolds , she is on her way back home . She is seated in the same carriage with the local aristocrat , Lady Beldon , who is a stereotype of that class . Mrs . Miniver doesn't have a mean bone in her body . She accepts with grace the proposal of the station master to have one of his roses named after her , and horror of horrors , he will compete head to head with Lady Beldon , who wins every year . The life of the Minivers will change dramatically as the oldest son , Vin is called into war action . He loves Carol Beldon , a young woman out of his social class . The war makes it possible for them to marry . Lady Beldon learns to accept people that are beneath her conservative way of life , something that would have seemed impossible in normal times . Of course , these are things that only happen in films . Alas , in the real world , the Minivers would probably had no chance in mingling in an aristocratic world where class mattered more than anything else . As Mrs . Miniver , Greer Garson brings her radiance to the screen . She had a way to make her presence be felt over the other actors when she appears . Walter Pidgeon plays the husband , Clem , but he has little to do otherwise . Lady May Whitty , is a delight as Lady Beldon , as is Teresa Wright , with her youth and beauty . Henry Travers , Richard Ney and Brenda Forbes also add their imprint to the film .
556108	1406078	39302	8.0	You're too marvelous , too marvelous for words . . . .	" Dark Passage " offers a different take on the San Francisco noir genre . This is a movie in which we get to know about the story that unfolds in front of us told in narrative style by the hero , who is never seen until about one hour into the picture . Delmer Daves , adapting the David Goodis novel has created something seldom seen in this type of films , in which , the hero's presence is required at all times . The film has a great style , as it offers a view of the San Francisco of the 1940s in ways that hadn't been seen before . The director was lucky to be able to open up the book in excellent ways to keep the viewer hooked from the start . The ' moderne ' style of that era is seen in glorious detail , especially Irene's apartment , where much of the action takes place . The effect of the glassed enclosed elevator makes a dramatic contribution to the look of this movie . The story of an innocent man , falsely condemned to prison for killing his own wife , parallels other movies . What's unusual here is that the presence of this convict is seen in another light with his own slant in to what really happened to the dead woman . There are other elements in the film that make it appealing . as the relationship between the escaped man , Vincent Parry , and the woman who rescues him , Irene Jansen . Sidney Hickox's stylish cinematography is one of the best assets of the film . The crisp images that one sees of the city , or the surrounding areas , add to the enjoyment of watching the mystery unfold . The mood is set by the swing music of the time as Frank Waxman's score is heard . Richard Whiting contributes the great song one hears in the background . The film is dominated by Humphrey Bogart , which says a lot about his power as an actor , and as a personality . When one considers he is actually not seen completely until after an hour into the movie , it speaks volumes of how the actor and the director were able to pull it through . The Irene Jansen of Lauren Bacall is another of the things that work in the film . Ms . Bacall's radiant beauty dominates every scene she is in . This actress had such a style that no matter what she is doing , she pulls our attention to her . The camera loved Ms . Bacall . The other best thing going for the film is the strong performances Mr . Daves has obtained from his cast . Agnes Moorehead makes a phenomenal appearance as the evil Madge Rapf . Her last scene with Mr . Bogart stands as one of the best moments in a film noir of the era . Ms . Moorehead's expressions as she is confronted with the facts , keep on changing as she absorbs everything being thrown at her . Clifton Young who plays Baker , the opportunistic would be criminal , is also effective , as he adds a layer of intrigue with an angle we didn't figure out existed . His fight with Parry at the bottom of the Golden Gate bridge is beautifully choreographed . Finally , the kind cab driver Sam , who helps Parry assume a new identity , as played by Tom D'Andrea is one of the highlights of the film , as well as the plastic surgeon , portrayed by Houseley Stevenson . This film , while not perfect , shows how well Delmer Dave's gamble paid in his conception for the film .
556414	1406078	30418	8.0	The court of Versailles	The tragic figure of Marie Antoinette , an Austrian princess who married Louis XVI of France , has been the subject of many books and two films . This 1938 version was the brain child of Irving Thalberg , a man who was well connected in Hollywood . This project which took a while to go into production , was a vehicle for his wife , the reigning queen of MGM , Norma Shearer . Marie Antoinette was the daughter of Maria Theresa , the empress of Austria , a woman who understood the role of power . The empress married her daughters in what she believed would be advantageous as she forged strategic alliances with other royal houses in Europe . Her daughter Marie Antoinette , like some of her sisters , married men that were not compatible with them , as proved by her union with the inept Louis XVI , a man that was childish and inefficient . A few years after the marriage both Louis and Marie Antoinette would be taken care by the popular justice of the French Revolution . Before her horrible end , Marie Antoinette was the object of envy and disdain by the sophisticates of the French courtiers who saw in her a naive girl . Marie Antoinette became the object of gossip . Her attraction for Count Axel DeFersen was natural since she had no love for her own husband . Her notorious rivalry with her father in law's mistress , the calculating Madame DuBarry , didn't help things either . In spite of all that she found a kindred soul in the Duc D'Orleans , who saw in her a girl lost among the wolves of Versailles . Norma Shearer , who returned to MGM after her husband's death , made a good impression as Marie Antoinette . Her take on the doomed queen seemed to be what was expected of her . Tyrone Power , as Count Axel projects his handsome presence ; it's clear to see what the tragic queen saw in him . Robert Morley , who plays Louis XVI made quite an excellent contribution to the film . John Barrymore as Louis XV , is a welcome presence . Joseph Schildkraut appears as the Duc D'Orleans , and Gladys George plays Mme . DuBarry . Others in the talented cast include Henry Stephenson , Alma Kruger , Albert Dekker , and many others that were uncredited for their efforts . The production owes big to Cedric Gibbons , the art director . His interiors of Versailles are stunning . For a black and white film , Mr . Gibbons ' interiors look and feel like the real thing . The cinematography of William Daniels , a man with a great eye for what worked in the cinema , captures the action in his unrivaled style . The background music of Gluck plays well with what one sees . Donald Ogden Stewart's screen play does justice to his subject . W . S . Van Dyke directed with an eye for the spectacle he delivers in this picture .
556317	1406078	256009	8.0	What is a ghost ?	Carlos , the young orphan , asks from Dr . Casares the question at the beginning of this haunting tale set in the dark days of the Spanish Civil War . Curiously enough , the Civil War captivates like this " ghost " , present day Spanish filmmakers . The young boy doesn't have to go far to encounter the vision that everyone knows lurks in the dark , or is it in the minds of all of the people involved in the death of Santi , the young boy who was in the wrong place , at the wrong time . Everyone within the orphanage knows about the tragedy of Santi but there is a conspiracy behind the tragedy and it's Carlos who discovers the mystery . For a director working out of his element , such as Guillermo del Toro is , the film he gives us his concept of evil behind a place that should have been a refuge for all the young children that lost parents in the conflict . The story is absorbing , keeping us interested in what appears to be a ghost tale , but isn't . The director gets good performances from the children as an emsenble and even the grown ups are very good , notably the great Federico Luppi who has worked with del Toro before . The only thing puzzling us is why does it have to be clarified his character is from Argentina when his presence in that remote area , surrounded by the war , would attract the attention he's probably trying to avoid . Marisa Paredes and Eduardo Noriega and the rest are well cast .
554805	1406078	400446	8.0	Moonlight sonata	Michael Pressman , a man that has directed a lot of television , suddenly gets an idea : How about do a play as a vehicle for his wife , the talented Lisa Chess , who in a way , has sacrificed her own career to dedicate herself to keep the couple's home and bring up the son that both adore . The play Michael decides to do is Terrence McNally's " Frankie and Johnnie in the Clair de Lune " , a work that seems to be perfect . That's where the problems start . Having received an IRS refund , Mr . Pressman thinks he can invest that money into a modest production . Little does he know that what starts as a fun incursion into the theater , ends up costing four times as first envisioned . First thing that goes wrong is the casting of Alan Rosenberg as Johnnie . This actor is involved in an indie picture , plus a series in television . It's clear he is an actor that has " disaster " written all over him . When they begin reading the play , it becomes clear that Alan wants to improvise . After that , he has trouble remembering his lines and finally , his ego gets the best of him and he decides the play is not for him , leaving Michael and Lisa hanging and in debt . After the fiasco he experienced , Michael decides to play Johnnie himself . The play will finally is seen . In a hilarious sequence , Cynthia , the company manager , is seen at the box office trying to deal with the invited crowd on opening night . Kathy Baker , the actress , who has four tickets waiting , gives her name , but Cynthia looks under Bates , as in Kathy , who happens to be the one that played Frankie in the New York production . A few other familiar faces are seen as well . Jilian Armenante does a fine job with her Cynthia . Best of all in the film is Alan Rosenberg , whose own take on what the actor he is supposed to play , must be a composite of other actors he , and Mr . Pressman have met during their years in show business . Lisa Chess is wonderful as Frankie . She is a beautiful woman who should be seen more often . Michael Pressman , playing himself , gives the right tone to a director that lives to regret his involvement in the theater . Others that appear briefly are , Mandy Patinkin , Stephen Tobolowsky , Leslie Moonves , David Kelley , and Hector Elizondo , among others . The film is fun and light , as it satirizes people who think too much of themselves . Michael Pressman has a keen eye for spotting all these people .
554848	1406078	303830	8.0	Desperate housewives adopting babies	Adopting children should be a labor of love . After all , if a woman finds herself unable to conceive , it would probably be a good idea to let her go anywhere where orphans and children that have been given up for adoption to be reunited with an infant . Well , in most cases , as we see in this film , there are people that profit from this process . It has turned to be a commercial enterprise for many people . We know a few cases where overseas adoptions have cost upwards of $100 , 000 . 00 , when all is taken into account . We meet six American women who have come to Mexico in the hope of adopting children . For one reason , or another , they haven't been able to have their own babies . The connection is clear , in this case , the lawyer in charge of the adoption recommend their clients to stay at Posada Santa Marta , where the owner , Senora Munoz is working with the unscrupulous man . Since the law requires to have a local lawyer , most would be mothers have to rely on this intermediary in order to adopt . The six women in the story are so different from one another that it is hard to imagine them socializing , had they not been thrown together in the hotel to await for their newly adopted babies . Although we don't get to know them in intimate details , we can see their desire to be mothers . The quiet Skipper turns out to be the one who has suffered three dreadful pregnancies in which all three infants had died . Nan , a pushy woman , is an unhappy camper . Everything irritates her and she lets anyone know about what she thinks about the country and the adoption procedures . Eileen , coming from a large Irish family has not been able to conceive . Leslie and Gayle seem to be the best adjusted of the women . Jennifer , is the youngest of them all . There are also a couple of stories running parallel to the American women . The most touching story comes from Asuncion , one of the maids in the hotel . When Eileen tries to communicate with her , the maid , not understanding her , tells her in Spanish about the way she had to give up her own baby girl for adoption . Also , we see what appears to be an upscale woman with her pregnant daughter , Celia , as the mother weighs her options and how the girl will not have an adoption . Celia , who is only fifteen years old , evidently had relations with Reynaldo , the young stud that roams the beach in search of easy conquests . John Sayles never cease to amaze us with his stories . In this film he tackles the commerce that goes on in the adoption process . At the same time , he makes a case for how complicated the whole thing is and how these would be mothers have to face as these young infants grow in an environment that stands in sharp contrast with the street children he brings into the movie . Those children are desperately in need for adoption , yet their own society , or would be parents , will bypass them in favor of the ones that can only be obtained in a legal manner . The ensemble cast does wonders under Mr . Sayles direction . Best of all is Marcia Gay Harden , as the pathetic Nan , a prototype of the " ugly American " abroad . Daryl Hannah has some excellent moments as Skipper . Lili Taylor , Mary Steenburgen , Maggie Gyllenhaal are fine . Susan Lynch has a great moment as she tries to talk with the maid . Vanessa Martinez gives a good rendition of her character Asuncion . Rita Moreno is also seen as the owner of the hotel . " Casa de los Babys " takes an excellent view at the thorny issue of adoptions .
554932	1406078	889652	8.0	Writer's block	Judith Ralitzer , a successful mystery novelist , is interviewed in a French television program not unlike " Bouillion de culture " , as the film starts . It appears the host of the program didn't care much for her latest novel . What he doesn't realize is that Ms . Ralitzer has been utilizing a man that is in reality the writer himself of many of her best sellers . " Roman de Gare " , which translates as ' airport novel ' , is a movie that plays in different levels . It is a mystery , and psychological character study of a famous writer who can't write and the man responsible for the success she has enjoyed . She has been employing the talented , but weird , Pierre Laclos , who may , or may not be a serial killer on the loose . Things are not easily explained as it is left to the viewer's imagination to solve this story . Claude Lelouch , a French director not associated with this genre , shows an affinity for telling the story with its many twists in such a way that one is riveted by the narrative . Mr . Lelouch , whose earlier success sort of betrayed his later works , shows he can't be easily dismissed . He wrote his own screen play which clearly demonstrates he understands the material and how to present it to his audience . Dominique Pinon , not exactly a matinée idol , was a felicitous choice to portray Pierre Laclos . He has a reptilian quality that we find repugnant , especially knowing first hand about the serial killer roaming the highways of France in search of victims . Mr . Pinon does wonder with a role that with someone else could not project the amount of hidden message he sends to the viewer . Fanny Ardant , an elegant actress , is also magnificent as the writer that has lost her creative powers . Ms . Ardant does amazing work for the director . When she has a fine role to play , she can be sublime , which is the case with her take of Judith Ralitzer . The same can be said about Audrey Dana , who plays Hugette , the woman abandoned by her boyfriend on a rest stop . Ms . Dana , who is new to us , complete the trio of brilliant performers in this intriguing tale . Claude Lelouch is in excellent form once again .
555655	1406078	286516	8.0	Miracle in Lampedusa	This is the first film by Emanuele Crialese that has played locally , I think , or if any other has come in , it hasn't played commercially . The film is beautifully done with the fantastic backdrop of the Italian island of Lampedusa . This is a very arid place with almost no vegetation at all . The heat , obviously , must be oppressive , as the sun punishes this land and its people constantly to the point that children act as savages , as proven by the opening scenes . Among these rascals are Pasquale and Filippo , the sons of Grazia , the housewife at the center of the story . She lives in her own world . She is a rebel and a free soul . Grazia's actions are seen as madness by her husband Pietro and his mother , who lives next door . It is the classic family from forgotten towns such as this , where everyone knows everyone's business . The only solution for Grazia's problems is to send her away to a Milan institution that perhaps will turn her into a vegetable . Her only sin is to be different , therefore , she is the town's eccentric . All her neighbors think she's a lunatic . By Grazia withdrawing from the world , she appears to be a maladjusted person , which she isn't . She just loves to be free ; swimming is her passion and her life , running around the island in her scooter is another form of freedom from the realities of home . In trying to escape her lot in life , Grazia discovers how much her son Pasquale loves her . The final scenes after the disappearance with the search party on the beach are typical of the same society that condemned Grazia but never took steps to show her any kindness . The miracle that occurs at the end is that perhaps Pietro realizes that in spite of his wife's apparent madness he has found how much he really needs her . This is a simple story told with a sure hand by the director , who also wrote the screen play . Valeria Golino , who has spent a few years in minor roles in Hollywood , is very effective as Grazia . She shows a great range of emotions under the sure direction of Crialese . It is amazing no one has made anything worth of Ms . Golino's talent , or that she has been forgotten by the Italian cinema ; or that no one has come to her with projects such as this film . As her husband , Vincenzo Amato is very effective . Also , Francesco Casisa as Pasquale makes a splendid appearance . This young man with the proper guidance has the potential of making a big splash in the Italian cinema .
554708	1406078	140397	8.0	The shrink	Lawrence Kasdan's " Mumford " is a film that could have been done by Frank Capra in another time . Mr . Kasdan created an enigmatic man , Dr . Mickey Mumford , who appears in the small town out of nowhere . He quickly goes to become an indispensable person in the community with his no-nonsense approach to psychiatry . Mumford touches the lives of the people that come to him seeking his advice . Among the people he helps , there is Sofie Crisp , a young woman suffering from depression and some sort of fatigue syndrome that renders her unfit to live her life to the fullest . With Mumford's help , she begins her daily walks as she gains confidence and opens up to see what is out there . The film opens with a black and white sequence that is a fantasy being played in the mind of Henry . We realize it's only his mind wandering as he is not capable of doing what he dreams about . There is also the young millionaire who is one of the richest men in the country because his firm produces modems for computers and who doesn't care to show his eccentric side for all to see . Mumford's cover is finally revealed when an episode of the television program " Unsolved Mysteries " in which he is showcased . The town of Mumford , instead of condemning him , rallies in its support of a man that has done more in his humble way to help the community in spite of his deceit . " Mumford " is a delightful movie thanks to Loren Dean , who plays the title role . Mr . Dean does a wonderful work . Hope Davis is also a charming presence in the picture . The large supporting cast has some brilliant faces in it , Alfre Woodard , Jason Lee , Mary McDonnell , Pruitt Taylor Vance , Martin Short , Jane Adams , David Paymer , and Ted Danson , among them . The film's success belongs to Lawrence Kasdan whose brilliant take on a man who is a fake , but who has seen into the hearts of the people he has decided to settle in .
556464	1406078	226238	8.0	A murder in Buenos Aires	This film bears the same name as Francisco Lombardi's excellent Peruvian movie . That's all the similarity , because this Argentine film depicts a crime and its investigation . The movie credits two persons with the direction : Beda Ocampo Feijoo and Maria Cecilia Barreras . The opening scenes take us on trip along the river to a fashionable district where the owner of a magazine is surprised in the bathroom and shot to death . Just as the police detective in charge of the investigation arrive , so does the lawyer of the publication , and the brother of the victim . The inspector questions the men , but releases them . Right after that , the magazine is in turmoil . Clara , who stands to lose the job , along with the other journalists , seeks the lawyer to offer her help in whatever she might be useful , something that will play in the plot , later on . The investigation into the murder of the wealthy man opens a can of worms as many people stand to gain by the disappearance of Abelardo . In a way , fans of this genre will probably figure out the outcome by the clues one is given at the beginning . The best thing in the film is Luis Luque , who makes an impressive , and cool detective . Malena Soldan , Mauricio Dayub , Luis Brandoni , Alejandra Flechner and Gaston Pauls do good work among the supporting players .
555468	1406078	295682	8.0	Atonement	Director Asif Kapidian's " The Warrior " just arrived to this city in its commercial run . This is a film that will surprise many viewers , nor only for its splendid beauty , but for the way the director has created the right atmosphere in which to tell his story . The amazing cinematography by Roman Osin , is well worth the price of admission . The musical score by Dario Marianelli enhances the action tremendously . We are taken to a place in Northern India , in the Rajastan , where a feudal lord is seen at the beginning of the movie receiving payment from his tenants . As one poor peasant can't pay , the ruthless man instructs his head henchman to kill the man by beheading him . The warrior , after he gets home , has a change of heart , as he realizes the enormity of his crime . The warrior and his teen aged son , embark in a trip to the mountains to get away from the feudal lord , but fate intervenes in that his former partners in crime finds the young man . These men take him to face the cruel lord , who orders him to be killed . The warrior , in the crowd witnesses his own son's death . What follows is a trip to the mountains , alone , where the former warrior meets a young boy along the way who wants to stay with him . They form a bond , until the following avengers catch up with their old partner and there's a showdown . At the end , the former outlaw finds some sense of serenity by staying with his son's friend and her family , where he is welcome . " The Warrior " is a film of rare beauty where great vistas of India , going from the arid locales of the beginning of the movie change drastically as the warrior goes to the Indian Himalayas , in sharp contrast with what the film has shown before . Irfan Khan plays the title role well under the direction of Mr . Kapadian . This is a film that clamors to be discovered , as it will not disappoint because of the remarkable work Asif Kapadian has achieved with this movie .
556280	1406078	420087	8.0	On the air	Garrison Keillor , a man who has been involved with radio in rural America , created " A Prairie Home Companion " , a program that was heard in the Midwest by the folks that appreciated this type of down to earth entertainment with excellent music by local artists , not too different from what the Ole Opry House offered . Mr . Keillor teamed with a director who has distinguished himself for bringing multi character entertainment , Robert Altman , who proved he knew how to set this kind of story when he directed the much better " Nashville " . " A Prairie Home Companion " is much more simple in narrative terms than " Nashville " , which had a loose story line in its narrative . Garrison Keiller's contribution to the film is to present this slice of Americana directed to simple folks that tuned to his programs on a weekly basis . Alas , it is the end for the program , airing from the majestic Fitzgerald theater . A group of all time favorites are to take place in it . We meet the Johnson sisters , a pair of older singers , Yolanda and Rhonda , who have been around for a while . We also see Dusty and Lefty , a pair of singing cowboys , and the other acts that lean toward gospel and country and western fare . Throughout the picture , a sad woman is seen moving around the theater and the stage . We gather she is not real because of the ethereal clothes she wears until her secret is revealed . She is an innocent victim of the program . There is also the head of security , Guy Noir , a clownish figure , typical of the environment and also the figure of the Axman , who has come to put an end to the broadcast from the Fitzgerald theater . This melancholic look at a form of entertainment that has fallen out of favor , is greatly reproduced by Mr . Altman . Garrison Keillor serves as the master of ceremonies for the radio broadcast . Meryl Streep and Lily Tomlin are excellent as the Johnson sisters . Lindsay Lohan appears as the daughter of Yolanda , a confused girl who loves to write songs and poetry about death and suicide . Woody Harrelson and John C . Reilly are perfect as the bawdy cowboy singers with a fabulous musical , and funny , musical number . Virginia Madsen , a fine actress , has little to do . Ditto for Kevin Kline and Tommy Lee Jones , two of our best actor working in movies today . Where Mr . Altman succeeds is in capturing the atmosphere of a radio program in the making . This is a nostalgic trip back to another gentle era that is dying a slow and painful death .
554671	1406078	96098	8.0	The trek in the mountains	After a diamond dealer's home is attacked by a man who wants the precious stones , the robber takes the dealer's wife hostage in a violent confrontation with the police and FBI in San Francisco . The agent in charge , Warren Stantin , gives the diamonds to the , almost invisible , man , who flees by boat taking the loot with him . The only way to beat the FBI and the people that are following him is to head north to Canada . Thus begins this action thriller that uses the Canadian Rockies as the backdrop for setting this story about a determined FBI enforcer following a deadly assassin who has left a trail of killings as he goes into the mountains . Stantin is told the only way to find his man is by engaging Jonathan Knox , a man who knows the area , to guide him . Knox , who is reluctant , at first , realizes the man might be part of a group his girlfriend , Sarah , is taking on an extended trek of the mountains . Stantin and Knox begin to fight as they have different ideas about what to do , but they end up bonding , as they understand what is at stake . This pair endures some of the worst weather conditions in their quest for the assassin , and in finding the diamonds that the outlaw wants to sell to an unscrupulous man in Vancouver . Roger Spottiswoode directed this action filled movie with sure hand . The screen play is by Harv Zimmel and Daniel Petrie , two men who know how to involve the viewer . Michael Chapman photographed the great outdoors with an eye on the dangerous aspects of the chase . Sidney Poitier is seen as Warren Stantin , an FBI agent that is restless in his pursue of the killer . This was Mr . Poitier's return to the movies after quite a number of years not being in front of a camera . Tom Berenger plays Knox , an outdoors man who is more at home in the mountains than among people . The surprise of the story is that we don't have a clue up to the middle of the film about who the real killer is . By positioning him among the group that Sarah is taking on a mountain expedition , adds a great deal of suspense to the story . The ending leaves a lot to be desired , but that's only a minor complaint about this action packed film .
555835	1406078	222150	8.0	Standing by	This satiric comedy from Cuba has a way to point out about that , in spite of years of hard times and sacrifice , things are just bad , if not worse than before . The last crop of films from that country seem to be critical to the situation there as in the case with Fernando Perez's " Suite Habana " and even in previous films by Mr . Tabio , notably , " Plaff " , " Guantanamera " , and " Fresa y chocolate " . This picture tackles , in a subtle way , some of the problems most Cubans face . In this case , it's the chaotic public transportation system in Cuba . Like anything coming from this type of cinema , what one is watching has a deeply different meaning for the locals , who can identify with a situation that appears to have no solution . Thus , we are taken to a remote small bus station where several people in need of transportation to all parts of the island have come to try to find means of getting to their destinations . Unfortunately , the local bus , based at the station , is being repaired and is soon evident that it's not going anywhere . In the meantime , the one bus that comes by , could only take one passenger , but as people try to storm the bus , it pulls out , leaving everyone stranded . Among the passengers one gets to know what motivates them to travel , as confidences are exchanged . The film makes one thing clear , and it is the Cuban character in accepting what comes their way and making the best out of the situation with humor . This society seems to make good of that saying about when God gives one lemons , one makes lemonade ! Among the performers in the film , Vladimir Cruz and Thaimi Alvarino , stand out . They play Emilio , an engineer , returning home to work in his father's plot of land as an agricultural laborer . Jacqueline , the pretty woman is trying to get to Havana where her fiancé , a Spaniard , is arriving to marry her and is taking her back to Spain with him . We also get to see Rolando , a man that pretends to be blind in order to get a preferential treatment and go ahead of everyone else because of his condition . This situation is closely disputed by all the people that have been waiting for days without any hope of going anywhere . Jore Perugorria , a frequent collaborator of Mr . Taibo does good work as Rolando , the blind man . Talk about stoicism ! This is a tribute to the Cuban character ! Juan Carlos Tabio has directed with his usual flair , making this a winning film that will please anyone .
555376	1406078	290145	8.0	Predator	It's always gratifying to see an independent film that tackles a thorny subject , knowing well that any of the major studios won't dare to sponsor any director who is original and has a different way to present the story . Such is the case with Karen Moncrieff , a courageous new voice who is a first time director working with her own material . The idea that school is a safe haven for the innocent , is the subject to this film . Meghan who comes from a recently broken home can't accept the idea of her parents living apart . When in school , she looks up to a male role model , perhaps trying to fill that void in her life . At the beginning of the film Ms . Moncrieff steers us into thinking one way , when in reality she wants to tell us there is another side to the apparently kind man who takes Meghan under his wing . As we have witnessed by the recent wave of revelations of sexual impropriety in the Catholic Church , there are people that tend to go to jobs where they can prey on unsuspecting young minds , only to satisfy their own sick desires . The film is an eye opener for any impressionable young person into believing these people that befriend them don't have ulterior motives . Agnes Bruckner , as young Meghan makes an excellent appearance in the movie . Equally effective is David Strathairn , as the teacher . This actor is always a welcome addition to any film . Margaret Colin , as the mother , gives a painful characterization as Diane , who must make ends meet and has her feet on the ground . Frances Fisher , is the jaded teacher's wife who has seen her husband get involved with other young girls before . Ms . Moncrieff is a talent to watch .
556262	1406078	299873	8.0	Dr . Faust's wishes	Dr . Fausto , a Spanish famous oncologist , is seen at a hospital's cancer area when the story opens . This man , who has probably dealt with death during most of his life , appears to be oblivious to pain . When he leaves for the medical congress we see him at the edge of the track where he is waiting for the train , and one gets the impression he is about to jump , but no , he actually is horrified when he sees a young man playing on the opposite track as a train enters the station . As he arrives at his destination , he meets the oily Santos Valle , a man that comes out of nowhere to remind the doctor he operated him and removed his stomach . Fausto tries to elude this man at all costs , but as it happens , his taxi breaks down in a slum area and guess who is conveniently passing by ? You know , it's Santos Valle . Santos Valle is a spooky man who plays with the doctor's emotions and tricks him into committing acts the physician would not dared to do on his own . Dr . Faust is aroused by the prostitute that comes to his hotel room , obviously sent by Valle . Later on , he attends a party in a strange house where he discovers a horrific place where all kinds of gore is stored . Since he doesn't remember who Santos Valle is , he contacts his assistant , Julia , a woman that has been with him for quite some time . She is asked to get the old hospital records for Santos Valle , who tricks her into bringing them to the medical congress . It's there where the secret is revealed . Valle , who has played with the doctor's mind , is indirectly responsible for Fausto looking at the young woman with different eyes . This is a collaborative project between the theatrical company La Furla's directors Alex Olle and Carlos Padrisa and newcomer Isidro Ortiz . La Furla has staged plays in London that were erotically charged . The film has a menacing aspect as Fausto , who hasn't been able to find a cure for cancer , asks Valle to save a young man , whose mother has been seen praying at his bedside at the beginning . In asking that , Valle-Mephistophles , thinks he owns Fauto's soul because of their bargain , which is also the idea behind the story which is a variation of the classic Goethe's book . Miguel Angel Sola and Eduard Fernandez do wonderful jobs as Fausto and Santos Valle , respectively . Mr . Sola , one of the best actors from Argentina , now settled in Spain , makes an impression as the title character . Eduard Fernandez is also up to the challenge in his diabolical take of the devil . Najwa Nimri is seen as Julia , but she has nothing to do in the film . For horror film fans " Fausto 5 . 0 " is a must see .
555743	1406078	427582	8.0	The group interview	Somehow , all the job applicants we meet , as the film opens , seem eager to please until they start comparing notes ; for some , this is a second interview . Since it's never clear for what position they are applying , one must assume it will be , at least , well paid . The five men and two women we meet turn out to be fierce competitors in a game where only one will get the prized employment . In a way , one wonders who , in its right mind , would like to be subjected to such an intense and grueling process of elimination in order to have the privilege of working for this mysterious firm . After all , nothing is made clear . As they go through the paces , outside chaos reigns as people take to the streets to protest against a global conference now taking place in Madrid . Enrique is the one that discovers what the game is like . He tells the others it seems to be the Granholm Method , in which aspiring employees must compete with one another until it's clear who will be the chosen person . Ana , who is an older woman , has her age against her . Julio , who was an executive that had to make a tough decision doesn't seem to have much chance at succeeding . Fernando , a sexist man , shows no mercy for anyone . Ricardo , who speaks loudly , but appears to be overly confident , doesn't seem to be a sincere contender , although he questions everything . Only Carlos and Nieves , who knew one another before , show the intelligence for being the logical choice . Marcelo Pineyro , a director we have admired before , shows great restraint in the way he shows the material on the screen . In fact , this film has a theatrical feeling , which can't hide this is a work that was created for the stage by Jordi Galceras , and brilliantly adapted by Mateo Gil . " El Metodo " shows an excellent cast of young Spanish actors that interact well with one another . Eduardo Noriega and Najwa Nimri are seen as Carlos and Nieves . Both give controlled performances . Mysterious Pablo Echarri , also impresses . Eduard Fernandez , Carmelo Gomez , Adriana Ozores , Ernesto Alterio and Natalia Verbeke complete the cast on this interesting film .
555301	1406078	217119	8.0	Epicure	Frederic Delamont , a wealthy business man , has a problem . He must have someone to taste the food he is going to eat . His aversion to fish and cheese presents a big problem for him . That is why , as the story begins , a young man , Nicolas Riviere , who is about to serve Delamont a dish in the restaurant he works as a waiter , is told by the diner to taste something from the plate he had just served and to describe its ingredients . When Nicolas gives the right answers , Delamont seems impressed by this waiter's knowledge in food . Nicolas is engaged to be Delamont's personal taster , something that his girlfriend , Beatrice , and the group of friends that share a large apartment , find weird . Delamont asks for what appear is way beyond the duties of an employee : he must go through a rigorous diet , and he must stop smoking . At the end of this trial , Delamont presents Nicolas with a feast of fish and cheeses . Having starved for so long , the banquet makes Nicolas sick and he develops the same repugnance for fish and cheese as Delamont . Delamont wants to dominate his relationship with the younger man , to the point that Beatrice feels she has to end seeing Nicolas . When Nicolas picks up a young woman at a hotel , Delamont offers to rent him a suite . As they are getting intimate , a robed Delamont appears out of nowhere to remind Nicolas he is the taster , and not to forget it ! The young girl was intended for his enjoyment only . There is a hint of homosexuality throughout the story , but everything is left in the air . The story , seen in flashbacks , appears to be the interrogation of the people that were close to Delamont , as it appears he has been killed , although this is left to the viewer's imagination . Bernard Rapp , the director of the film , created an elegant story that , at times , kept reminding us of Joseph Losey's " The Servant " , although this film has two uneven roles . Frederic Delamont is a calculating and manipulative rich man , whereas Nicolas Riviere , is poor as well as dazzled by his sudden brush with wealth and power . The main reason for watching this intriguing film is because of the sophisticated portrayal Bernard Giraudeau gives to Frederic Delamont . He completely dominates the film with his performance . Jean-Pierre Lorrit , who plays Nicolas , is quite good , but unfortunately , he is playing against a great actor , and it shows . The film has an interesting cinematography by Gerard Battista and the atmospheric music of Jean-Philippe Gaude . The production designer , Francois Comtet did a wonderful job with the many sets used in the Lyon area . We'll be looking forward to Bernard Rapp's next project because he shows he is on the right track for doing great things .
555684	1406078	382330	8.0	Making music	A famous orchestra conductor , Daniel Dareus , suffers what appears a heart attack as he finished conducting a concert .

The local pastor , Stig , whose church has a small choir , comes calling to see if he can interest Daniel in helping , but the conductor has no desire to go back to music .

The vicar suddenly begins seeing Daniel in a new light ; he is a tormented man who likes to read pornographic magazines before making love to his wife , Siv .

Daniel , who by now has fallen totally for Lena , has a chance to show for the first time in his life his feelings for her when she starts to gets doubts about their relationship . Daniel who is late for his own concert , gets to hear them making extraordinary music even though he is not in among them . Kay Pollak , the director of this enormously appealing film , shows he was the man to direct it . The story involves the viewer from the start . Great part of the success of the movie goes to the ensemble cast that was put together . William Nykvist , who plays the leading role is the best excuse for watching the film . Frida Hallgren , Niklas Falk , Ylva Loof , do excellent work for Mr . Pollak . Stefan Nilsson is the composer for most of the beautiful music one hears . Harald Gunnar Paalgard's cinematography makes the film look better capturing different seasons for the viewer in their beauty .
556339	1406078	274117	8.0	My lips are sealed !	Only in French films , as well as in European ones , an actor such as Vincent Cassel would have a leading role . For that matter , so does Emmanuelle Davos . They are no stars by American standards . Yet , in the roles they play in this movie , they're quite effective . This thriller keeps you going . It is well paced and it has all the right elements for the ironic twist at the end . Director Jacques Audiard pulls it off with a sure hand . It was one of the most entertaining and light films that have come in from the French cinema in a while .
555764	1406078	55310	8.0	The age of innocence .	The atmosphere of this film took me back to another time and place , to a very naive and innocent Spain . This film is Garcia Berlanga's incursion into his own brand of neorealism . The music keeps evoking the scores of the great Italian masterpieces of that period . Placido , the hero , in a way , is everyman caught in a web of bureaucracy where he has to fight against all the odds to keep his vehicle in order to survive . He does whatever he can in order to pay the draft , but all conspires against him . Placido is a decent working person , a man of honor who has to fulfill his obligations , in this case , paying the draft that is due on the day the story unfolds . Everything is against him . We see him fighting his way to do so , in this , his long journey into the Christmas Eve celebration . Cassen was a marvelous and charismatic actor who was very convincing as Placido . He's always at the center of the action , and at times , he is even at the center of some of the other characters conflicts . Jose Luis Lopez Vazquez , is very effective as Gabino , the photographer . The rest of the ensemble cast perform very well under the direction of Garcia Berlanga . The film is a lot of fun .
555566	1406078	36174	8.0	Knitting	H . C . Potter's " Mr . Lucky " is a film that should be seen more often . This comedy gave Cary Grant a chance to portrait a different character from the ones his fans were expecting from him . The story of Joe Adams , a draft dodger , who is involved in illegal gambling , makes great sense because at the end , when all was said and done , he does the right thing and redeems himself . Joe is a gambler at heart ; it takes a beautiful woman to transform him into a caring man who will do good , in spite of what his original intentions were . As a comedy , " Mr . Lucky " , has some brilliant moments , especially those involving Joe , now Bascopolous , learning to knit to help make sweaters for the men fighting the war . The director imparted a light touch to this comedy , making us care for Bascopolous , when one should hate his intentions . In finding love with the beautiful Dorothy Bryant , Joe realizes she is the woman for him , in spite of the differences between them . After having cheated her , he takes money to repay what he took from her , even before he is confronted by Mr . Bryant and the police . Disappearing and going straight is clear at the end of the film when one sees Dorothy waiting at the end of the pier for his appearance . The film works because the tremendous performance Cary Grant gave in it . Even though he is supposed to be a bad guy , one never believes he is all that bad . Laraine Day is perfect as Dorothy Bryant , who doubted Joe's intentions from the beginning , but ends up falling for him because she sees a man who will do the right thing and will change his ways . The supporting cast is one of the strengths of the movie . Charles Bickford , Gladys Cooper , Alan Carney , Henry Stephenson , Paul Stewart , and the rest , are good following Mr . Potter's direction . The great black and white cinematography by George Barnes , compliments the film well . The screen play by Milton Holmes was helped by other uncredited writers , among them , Charles Brackett and Dudley Nichols , two distinguished screen writers that knew about comedy . Ultimately , this is a film carried by the sheer power of Cary Grant and the lovely Laraine Day and the inspired direction of H . C . Potter .
554517	1406078	417182	8.0	Cross country driving looking for Andy	" The Talent Given Us " is a disarming film done cinema-verite style where the Wagner family is shown candidly as they embark in a voyage of discovery when they travel cross country trying to visit their son Andy , a screen writer living in Los Angeles . The Wagners are an outspoken New York City family who tell it all to the camera in a disarming way . The patriarch , Allen , is afflicted with an undisclosed neurological illness that has made him weak and must be careful walking , as he might fall easily . Judy , the mother , is a woman full of life , who seems to be a fun person to know because she is a no nonsense woman . We meet also the two daughters , Maggie and Emily .

Judy , the concerned mother who has been trying unsuccessfully to contact Andrew , suddenly has the urge to keep going west to see what's wrong with her son . Along the way , we get to know more of the Wagners , as we feel we are in the car with them , going for the ride . The trip seems to bring the Wagners closer together . Allen and Judy seem to find peace as they start the return journey home .

555849	1406078	285066	8.0	In the life	This Uruguayan film is surprisingly good . Not being acquainted with either the director , or the film , as I don't think it has been shown locally , I decided to take a look . It certainly was a welcome surprise what director Beatriz Flores Silva has accomplished . The story centers around Elisa , a young single mother , who must make ends meet by going into the world's oldest profession . Elisa , like other young women , I'm sure , is lured into taking a big leap into the riches that Placido suggests are not to be believed doing that kind of work in Barcelona . Elisa gets more of what she bargained for . She is beaten by Placido and the reality is that she is part of a lucrative business not to be realized by her , but her pimps and the mafia that controls it . It seems incredible that someone as intelligent as Elisa is , falls into this world where women are in danger by working the mean streets in the old quarter of the city . The film owes a great deal to Mariana Santangelo , a young actress who is a natural . She is an excellent actress who knows the character she is portraying . Andrea Fantoni , as her best friend , Lulu , also is very effective in the film . Silvestre as Placido , the suave pimp , plays his part well . Finally , Jose Linuesa , is also good as Marcelo , who is the only one that helps Elisa escape her horrible experience in Spain .
555268	1406078	443543	8.0	The conjurer	Early in life , Eisenheim understands how his destiny is going to be tied to magic . Unfortunately for the young man , after falling in love for a rich young girl , Sophie , his powers prove to be a failure when he can't prevent the young woman from being taken away from him . Sophie will always keep the locket with a secret mechanism Eisenheim made for her as a reminder of his love . For fifteen long years Eisenheim roams the world trying to perfect his craft as a magician . When the time is ripe , he returns to Vienna to look for his long lost love and to dazzle audiences with his amazing tricks . It is at his Vienna appearances that his fame reaches the crown prince Leopold , who wants to see this illusionist . He is accompanied to the performance by Sophie , who is now Leopold's love interest . When Eisenheim asks for a volunteer for one of his magic tricks , it's Sophie who goes to the stage . Eisenheim recognizes his beloved Sophie who still wears the locket around her neck . Things get complicated when Eisenheim is asked to do a performance for the prince at the palace . The one trick that stuns everyone is when the conjurer asks the prince for his sword , which he makes stand on the stage . He then asks members of the audience to try to lift the sword , which magically remains glued to the ground . Only when he tells Leopold to take the sword back , the sword is released to its rightful owner . That sword will yield a valuable clue to the mystery we are witnessing later on . Eisenheim made an admirer in Uhl , the chief of police who is impressed by what he sees Eisenheim do on stage . Uhl will be the only man who will understand the secret that Eisenheim keeps in his heart . This highly enjoyable movie directed by Neil Burger , is based on a short story by Steven Millhauser . The adaptation by Mr . Burger gets a great treatment for the screen . The film is helped by the interesting score of Philip Glass . Mr . Burger has done wonders with the way he envelops the audience with magic as one watches in amazement how Eisenheim performs his thrilling act . Dick Pope photographed the movie in dark tones that reflect the mood of most of the action on the screen . His take on the Czech exteriors strike the right note . Naomi Geraghty must be congratulated for the editing , since it involves the way the viewer perceives the tricks being done by Eisenheim . Edward Norton gives a wonderful performance as Eisenheim . He is clearly a man with a mission in life and he has returned to his native land to take what he believes is rightfully his . Paul Giamatti's Inspector Uhl has some good moments too . Lovely Jessica Biel is seen as Sophie and Rufus Sewell plays the crown prince Leopold . " The Illusionist " will not disappoint fans of Edward Norton because the good work of the director , Neil Burger , did in adapting the original material for this highly engrossing picture .
555623	1406078	231968	8.0	Overcoming prejudice	This nine minutes short film packs more in it than some full length features . Don Weis directed this little gem in which prejudice is dealt with in a subtle manner . A poignant story by Lucille Schlossberg was the basis for the screen play written by Allen Rivkin . It's a simple story . A soldier , whose buddy has died in combat , comes to pay his respects to his mother . Mrs . Wrenley appears to be glad to receive in her home this young man , JoJo , who has brought the last letter he received from the dead soldier . When he mentions his name , Maxie Klein , Mrs . Wrenley clearly changes from the welcoming lady that is happy to meet her son's friend into a woman whose prejudice indicates she resents the intrusion . She can't even understand how his son could have been friendly with the man in front of her . When Maxie offers to read her son's letter , she doesn't refuse . She can't believe what she is hearing as her son talks about tolerance and acceptance he has seen in the army . It's too much for her to digest , but she realizes the goodness in Maxie Klein's heart as her attitude toward him melts away . The film shows excellent performances from Marjorie Main and Keefe Brazelle , the two characters in the short .
554954	1406078	55981	8.0	The separation	We are taken to what appears a neighborhood dance hall , as the film begins . The lights are out , the people are seated , awaiting the start of the music . The musicians arrive and begin playing . Two women of a certain age take to the floor , followed by the other couples . It's at this point that Giovanni and Liliana , who are serious about one another , enter and sit at one of the tables . Hardly a word is spoken , yet , watching Lilliana's face , we realize something is wrong . We figure the problem lies in the fact that Giovanni has accepted a position in a new industrial complex his company has set up in Sicily . The job means he will be away for a whole year with better pay and a promotion . This doesn't sit well with Lilianna , and her attitude at the dance hall explains the way she feels the separation will take Giovanni away from her forever . As Giovanni gets settled into the job , we watch him roaming the streets of the little town . He is clearly a loner since he prefers his own company . Giovanni has to struggle with the fact his elderly father has stayed behind and must deal with the idea of living in a nursing home . Toward the end of the story he receives a letter from Lilianna where she gives him news of home . Giovanni , who obviously misses her sees a way for resuming their relationship . Ermanno Olmi was a documentary maker before his magnificent screen debut with " Il Posto " . In a way , " I Fidanzati " feels like a continuation of the other film . The ballroom sequence brings to mind the New Year's ball of the former movie . This idea is arrived at because the bored expressions of the couples at the neighborhood dance hall . No one seems to be having fun . Lilianna , whose face betrays her , shows a woman at the border of despair as she figures that Giovanni's departure means the end of her chances of marrying Giovanni . The director was wise to employ Lamberto Caimi to photograph this film . The music score of Gianni Ferrio plays well with the action on the screen . Mr . Olmi guided his unknown cast to give excellent performances . Carlo Cabrini and Anna Canzi seem to have been naturals for the screen , yet , neither actor went to have a career in the Italian cinema . Mr . Cabrini , whose presence is deeply felt in the film does an amazing job in his portrayal of Giovanni . Ermanno Olmi , a director's director , showed that his early promise with " Il Posto " was not a fluke , as he continued to create human comedies about the way he saw his country at this time of his career .
556621	1406078	339489	8.0	Revenge , lies and videotapes	Ramon , the aesthetics professor one meets at the beginning of the story , is a strange man . His apartment is a mess , yet his immaculate basement is so clean that it seems incredible he is preparing to commit a heinous crime and disturb anything that is so orderly and neat . Ramon , who is first seen speaking in a prerecorded video cassette , is finally seen wearing the same shirt as in the tape . His former wife , Laura , a psychiatrist , is tied and gagged . Ramon , who has confessed as to being a serial killer , having killed nineteen people to date , wants to torture Laura for whatever pain he feels she caused to him after they divorced . He proposes a game where he would say a word and she must answer him using the last syllable of the word in a new word . If she loses , he'll pop out one of her eyes . When that happens , Laura demands a rematch . Ramon tells her if she loses now , he'll pop out both eyes . After Ramon and Laura have played their game , he is shown at the college where he is teaching his philosophy class . Two police inspectors come to interrogate him about Laura's disappearance . At first Ramon is cool and collected . He doesn't get ruffled as questions about his actions are thrown at him . In a final sequence Laura , who by now has become emboldened because she figures he has gotten the best of him by using psychology , questions him about the murders he had confessed . It's clear he has not been telling her the truth , but what emerges is the fact Ramon's frame of mind when Laura asks him about his mother and his liaison with a male student . " Palabras encadenadas " is a psychological thriller based on a theatrical play by Jordi Galceran and adapted by its director , Laura Mana , whose work in this film shows a sure hand and a noted improvement on some of her previous work . Although it feels like a deeply felt staged play , there are moments of great intensity in the cat and mouse play Ramon plays with Laura . The best thing in this film is Dario Grandinetti . He is in total command and he lets the viewer know from the start . This actor gets better and better all the time . He gives an intense performance that is hard to imagine any other actor playing this part . Goya Toledo , is seen as Laura . She also has wonderful opportunities where to shine . Fernando Guillen and Eric Bancatto , appear as the police inspectors investigating the disappearance and possible murder of Laura . This is a highly polished film from Laura Mana .
555064	1406078	343818	8.0	But will the robots do windows ?	We didn't watch this film when it was released but caught with it on cable recently . Alex Proyas , the director , shows a talent for what one sees on the screen . The film is loosely based on Isaac Asimov's novel of the same title , which was adapted for the screen by Jeff Vintar and Akiva Goldsman , one of the best writers for this medium . The film is pure entertainment . As such , without any expectations , it turned out to be a lot of fun . The story , as these highly glossy movies go , relies a lot on the special visual effects that dazzled us because of what the designing team were able to accomplished with the creation of thousand robots all over the place . Will Smith , as Del Spooner , is immediately likable . Mr . Smith has a way to get the viewer on his side from the start and we go with him for this fantastic ride , that of course , is far fetched , at best , but since we fall right into what's going on , it's easy to see the ride is a fun one . Bridget Moynahan is seen as Susan Calvin , an assistant to Dr . Albert Lanning , a genius whose work in robotics gets him killed . Ms . Moynahan , who was also seen in " The Farm " , is the perfect foil for Mr . Smith , as both embark in the adventure we are watching . James Cromwell , the inventor , is only seen briefly , as well as another excellent actor , Bruce Greenwood , who has only a few scenes in the film . Watch " I Robot " because Alex Proyas and his team has made it a marvelous escape thriller that will not bore anyone .
555322	1406078	48605	8.0	Marilyn in the subway	Billy Wilder did wonders with the funny George Axelrod play , in which " The Seven Year Itch " is based . Mr . Wilder was after all a man who knew movies , as he shows with his adaptation of the original material . In addition , Mr . Wilder had a talent for directing actors and getting the best out of them . This is a film that although most people haven't seen , they will always remember the picture of Marilyn Monroe standing above a subway vent with her skirt flying around her because of the sudden rush of a train below ! Ms . Monroe was shown in all her beauty to a camera that obviously adored her . This film and " Some Like it Hot " , also directed by the great Billy Wilder , gave Marilyn Monroe's admirers a glorious view of the actress at her best . Tom Ewell , is equally excellent as the summer bachelor , Richard Sherman , left alone in Manhattan to fend for himself . Mr . Ewell's opening scenes are amazing in playing out his fantasies . His interplay with the gorgeous Marilyn Monroe shows a timing hard to match by many comedians . Mr . Ewell gives a delightful performance . This is a delightful comedy . All the right elements are well balanced to produce the intended results . Best of all is the incomparable Marilyn Monroe in one of her best screen appearances guided by Billy Wilder .
555721	1406078	44706	9.0	Citizen Kane	High Noon is one of the most loved films of all times thanks to the elements that came together to make it the classic that it is . The movie owes a lot to Fred Zinnemann for his tight account of this story by Carl Foreman . The film benefits from Dimitri Tiomkin's great score and the great cinematography by Floyd Crosby . This is a film that packs a lot of symbolism because of the times when it was done . Those were the days of the communist hysteria where many people in the industry were accused , tried and lost jobs because when they faced the HUAC and Senator Joseph McCarthy . Gary Cooper plays a man who is decent enough to return to the town where he just has gotten married and has finished his tour of duty . His conscience doesn't let him leave his post as he delays his plans and goes back to defend the town from the bandit who's been freed by Northern judges , and is coming back to seek revenge from Marshal Kane and the town . Gary Cooper embodied the all Amercian hero . He was an actor who could do no wrong , as he proves in his take of Marshal Kane . We see him as the clock is ticking away toward noon time when the train will arrive in Hadleyville . We see him perspire as he goes around trying to get people help him deal with the problem , to no avail ; he will have to do it himself . In the process , he clearly disappoints his new bride , who is horrified at the prospect of losing the man she clearly loves . Grace Kelly was such an elegant figure that it's hard to imagine she would be in Hadleyville at all ! Katy Jurado was also excellent as the jaded Helen Ramirez , the woman who owned a lot of businesses in town . Also effective , Thomas Mitchell , as the mayor of the town and Lloyd Bridges , as Harvey . This is a film to treasure .
555436	1406078	400868	10.0	Soul mates	Antoine , a struggling actor , meets a lovely young woman in the metro . Claire , who sits across from Antoine , can't help but looking at him , as he also steals away glances at her . When he starts writing her a note in what seems to be a script , she writes him back . After they write one another for a few minutes , arriving at her stop , she asks him is he can't talk and gives him her phone number . After Antoine manages to get a hold of himself , he calls Claire and they agree to meet . They both like one another ; the chemistry appears to be perfect between them . Antoine and Claire begin a relationship in which everything seems to be perfect , until we watch them awaiting their turn in a clinic where both have gone for a check-up . We realize there's something wrong and naturally , we think it's Antoine the one with the problem . Nothing prepares when Claire declares she is HIV + Things begin to unravel as Claire and Antoine's relationship begins to suffer because what she perceives as his attitude toward her . When Claire decides to leave Antoine , he is not ready to accept the fact . Even though he has come around to support her , she can't accept it . Antoine , who has been distant from his father , comes home for a visit in which the older man confesses how wrong he had been in opposing his decision to become an actor . Antoine , who has not seen Claire , goes to see her as she is celebrating her birthday , but it's too late for the lovers . The last scene shows Antoine's face framed by a window looking at the lovely Claire at her party with her guests . Director Arnaud Viard , an actor himself , has accomplished the impossible : a serious film about an important theme that doesn't preach , or throw in our faces heavy messages . His take on the relationship is the right one . Who knows makes two people fall in love ? Or better yet , what triggers them to break what appears to be a solid commitment between these two people love that love one another passionately ? Of course , the HIV virus is at center stage getting between Antoine and Claire in ways they never thought possible . The only surprise in the film is the way Claire contracts the virus , which she could also have transmitted to Antoine . By casting the two attractive leads that personify cleanliness and purity , Mr . Viard throws us a curve ball out of nowhere , suggesting perhaps there is no perfect love relationships . The best thing in the film are the two leads . Julien Boisselier is immensely likable . He is handsome , has a great screen presence and plays well together with the exquisite Julie Gayet , who we have admired in other movies . Ms . Gayet , in turn , has a luminosity and clarity , as her character's namesake . She is an adorable young actress who doesn't make a false movement in her portrayal of Claire . The wonderful Michel Aumont , seen as Antoine's father , makes a great impression and contributes to the success of the film . Arnaud Viard , who also wrote and produced this amazing film , tells his story in 81 minutes , something that other creators would spend more time without the same amazing results . One can only salute Mr . Viard and hope for more great films from him .
556052	1406078	35160	10.0	Obsession	Luchino Visconti was light years ahead of his contemporaries . The great directors of Italy of the 40s and 50s were men who understood the medium , but it was Luchino Visconti , a man of vision , who dared to bring a film like to show what he was capable of doing . He clearly shows his genius early on in his distinguished career with " Ossessione " , a film based on James Cain's " The Postman Always Ring Twice " , which was later made by Hollywood , but that version pales in comparison with what Visconti achieved in the movie . Luchino Visconti and his collaborators on the screen included an uncredited Alberto Moravia , a man who knew about the effect of passion on human beings . The film has been well preserved in the DVD format we watched recently . The film is a must for all serious movie fans because we can see how Visconti's vision translated the text into a movie that rings true in a plausible way , something the American version lacked . What comes across watching the movie , is the intensity which the director got from his key players . The magnificent Clara Calamai does an amazing job as Giovanna , the woman who has married an older man , but when Gino appears in her life , all she wants to do is rid herself of the kind man who gave her an opportunity in life . Giovanna is one of the best creations in Ms . Calamai's achievements in the Italian cinema . The last sequence of the film shows Ms . Calamai at her best in the ironic twist that serves as the moral redemption for the monstrous crime that was committed . Equally excellent is Massimo Girotti , one of the best actors of his generation who appears as Gino , the hunky man that awakens the obsessive passion in Giovanna . Gino is the perfect man for Giovanna , something that Mr . Girotti projects with such ease and sophistication not equaled before in the screen . Mr . Girotti makes the man come alive in a performance that seems so easy , yet with another actor it might not have been so apparent . Juan DeLanda is seen as Giuseppe , the older man who fell in love with Giovanna . In fact , his character rings truer than his counterpart in the American film , where he is seen more as a buffoon . The film is beautifully photographed by Domenic Scala and Aldo Tonti . They gave the film a naturalistic look that was the way Italian directors of the era favored . The original musical score of Giuseppe Rosati is perfect . Visconti , a man who loved opera and was one of the best directors , also includes arias by Bizet and Verdi that fit well in the context of the movie . " Ossessione " is a film to treasure because we see a great Luchino Visconti at the top of his form .
555345	1406078	47876	10.0	The swindlers	Federico Fellini followed " La Strada " with this film . A forgotten classic that on second viewing still has the same impact when we saw it at a retrospective of the master's work some time back . Fellini was instrumental in creating this magnificent movie about con men that operated in Italy in the years that followed the end of WWII . Fellini worked on the screen play with his collaborators , Tullio Pinelli and Ennio Flaiano ; they gave life to all these swindlers and made them human . Nino Rota's music and Otello Martinelli's cinematography compliment the film and make it even better . Fellini was a director that got a lot from his actors , as he shows in " Il Bidone " . Working with Broderick Crawford , and again with Richard Basehart , he was able to have both men give excellent performances , especially Mr . Crawford , who looks as though he is nothing but Italian because he convinces us he is the hard man he is portraying . The three friends , Augusto , Picasso , and Roberto , go from one scheme to the next , never thinking about who are they stealing from . The best caper occurs at the beginning of the film as the trio arrives at the farm of the two older women with the promise of riches hidden in their land . Mr . Crawford's bishop is perfect . So is the assistant priest of Richard Basehart . Franco Fabrizi is the driver . The solution for getting the money away from the poor women is something not to be believed . Augusto's life is an empty one . He goes from one job to another trying to outsmart his victims . It's not until Augusto meets his daughter Patrizia by chance , that he begins to feel what might be some remorse for his actions as he notices his beautiful daughter now grown and on her way to making something out of her life . His conscience begins to bother him because he realizes the evil of his ways . The other best sequence in the film involves the party at Vargas ' house where the swindlers have been invited to celebrate the arrival of the new year . We watch as Iris , Picasso's wife , realizes what her husband and the others are really up to . Roberto , the ladies ' man , steals the gold cigarette case , not realizing that he is at the home of another con man and his actions will not go unnoticed , but even the embarrassment he goes through in front of the guests will make him give up his life . " Il Bidone " is a fine example of the Italian cinema of those years as it shows an artist of the caliber of Federico Fellini in top form . The film will delight people that haven't been exposed to that part of Mr . Fellini's career seldom seen these days .
555242	1406078	264464	10.0	Witty con man .	From the opening credits design we get in the mood of this very entertaining film . They create the tone for what will follow . Steven Spielberg is in rare form directing this movie that doesn't have a dull moment . Mr . Spielberg has found a perfect actor to fill the shoes of the con man with the perfect casting of Leonardo DiCaprio . It's very easy to see why all the women fall prey of this charmer . He was a fast talker and a slick operator . He exudes charisma to fill another couple of movies . It's a welcome sight to have Mr . DiCaprio working in a vehicle that shows his talent as Frank Abagnale , a man of many faces . He plays a game of hide-and-seek throughout the movie with Hanratty , the FBI agent that is in his trail . Tom Hanks shows great assurance and gusto with this character . Of course , the DiCaprio magnetism dominates the action with the many ironic twists and the miraculous and narrow escapes he pulls with an aplomb that's bewildering to the Feds , who are on his tail all the time . The minor roles are equally important . Christopher Walken as the father starts out as the prototype of the con man , but he's too decent to do wrong ; his business fails eventually . His marriage to Natalie Baye , the fine French actress , ends in divorce because obviously she hates being married to a loser . The action doesn't stop for one moment . This film is great fun to watch with the winning combination Mr . Spielberg assured hand gives us this time out . Mr . Spielberg can thank the genial Mr . DiCaprio who responds obviously to his direction and makes this con man endearing even when he is committing crimes .
554837	1406078	166924	10.0	Nightmare in la-la land	David Lynch's Mulholland Dr . is a rare film that combines the best elements of previous works and gives us a spellbinding picture that keep us riveted to our seats even when there is no action . The combination of the two actresses , Naomi Watts and Laura Elena Harding , produces unexpected results . Nothing is so on the surface , or better yet , appearances are deceiving , to put it mildly . There is a very strange chemistry in the interplay between these two great actresses than in many recent films . It was great fun to see the great Ann Miller in the role of the landlady , Coco . She's a welcome sight in the middle of the mystery that we're trying to decipher with all the clues that Mr . Lynch throws us . It's a shame that the rest of the old familiar faces , like Lee Grant , Robert Forster , Chad Everett , don't get enough time on camera . This strange film was very different from the childish Hollywood fare of late . It's a shame Mr . Lynch doesn't get the chance to give us his vision of his world , which is always welcome by his appreciating fans . A job well done .
554742	1406078	118111	10.0	Broadway bound	Christopher Guest has the knack for creating films where genuine laughter never stops . We saw this film when it was originally released , but caught it recently in the retrospect of Mr . Guest's films shown recently here . " Waiting for Guffman " is , to this humble viewer , probably his best creation to date . Not only is this a funny movie , it shows the genius of Mr . Guest at his best . Corky St . Clair , the director from the New York stage seems completely out of place in Blaine , Mo . He is too witty for that small little town , where he is clearly adored , not only by the local thespians , but by the whole municipal council . Some of the lines one hears coming from Corky's mouth are so amazing that one wonders if the citizens of Blaine fully realize they have a gem living in town . The players auditioning for Corky's new production about Blaine's beginnings , live in a world of themselves . Ron and Sheila Albertson , are the star of other productions , so they return again for the new show . Libby Mae Brown works in the Dairy Queen , but her ambition is to be a star . Even the local dentist , Dr . Allan Pearl , is attracted to become a performer . There are two other underlying plots going on in the film . There is the history part , or how Blaine came to be , and the other notorious incident of the flying saucer that came into town and took several of the citizens for a tour of the space craft and we are being told about it by the people that experienced that adventure . Christopher Guest makes a wonderful Corky St . Clair . Mr . Guest knows what makes Corky great . Corky , no doubt , is a composite of people Mr . Guest must have known at one time or another . Corky is an enormous achievement for Mr . Guest as a writer and as a performer . Fred Willard and Catherine O'Hara are incredible in their take of the Albertsons , the travel agents without a clue of what's going on outside Blaine . Ron's delicate operation is explained in some detail to the horrified Mrs . Pearl . Eugene Levy , Mr . Guest's frequent collaborator is right on the money as the dentist with singing aspirations . Parker Posey , is the girl who thinks Broadway is only a few steps away . Paul Dooley , Don Lake , Larry Miller , Linda Kash , are among the citizens of Blaine one gets to know in the film . Of course , none of this would have been possible without Christopher Guest . It's a shame we don't get to see more of him , but that makes even better whatever he decides to offer us from time to time .
556000	1406078	427944	10.0	The lobbyst	Nick Baylor is a tobacco lobbyst in Washington . His work is to influence people in Congress about his product : cigarettes . Never mind the usage has long been considered bad for anyone that uses it , Nick will debate anyone and will always have an answer that will make his opponents appear as though they are the bad guys . That is the case when Nick is seen on a talk show , where he sits next to a young man afflicted with cancer caused from smoking , who at the end of the show will have a different opinion of the industry that made him sick . Or take the presentation Nick makes to his son Joey's career day class . When the young girl tells him that her mom says smoking is bad for you , Baylor questions her if her mother is a doctor to have arrived at that conclusion . Baylor's great idea is to try to enlist Hollywood into letting big stars be seen smoking on whatever movies they appear . He presents the idea to a powerful Jeff Megall , an insider man , who is willing to go along for the right price . Nick Baylor is the ultimate salesman . After all , he and his employer have enormous resources to pay the right people in order to get their message across . Nick Baylor loves his son , who now lives with his mother . Nick wants to teach his son a valuable lesson , so that he can fully appreciate what he does for a living . The result is a young boy that begins to see his father side and how the truth , as is perceived , can be manipulated by anyone with the right contacts with people in government . Jason Reitman's adaptation of Christopher Buckley's enormously funny satire about the role of the lobbyst in our society is one of the best films about this subject that have been brought to the screen . Mr . Reitman clearly understands how power and money make a heady combination in the way he presents the story . It's hard to imagine anyone else but Aaron Eckhart playing Nick Baylor . Mr . Eckhart is never obnoxious , or overbearing . His Nick is a man who knows what moves people to do the things they do and has no scruples in getting them done . Cameron Bright , is seen as Nick's son Joey . This young actor was the perfect choice also , because he brings an uncanny intelligence to whatever role he is asked to play . The rest of the ensemble cast do well under Mr . Reitman's direction , with great contributions by Maria Bello , William H . Macy , Rob Lowe , Adam Brody , Robert Duvall , Katie Holmes and the rest . " Thanks for Smoking " shows a new talented director , Jason Reitman , working with an excellent Aaron Eckhart to great results in a movie that will not disappoint .
555243	1406078	299658	10.0	My kind of town !	Rob Marshall shows a great affinity for the musical genre in directing this film based on the musical by Kander and Ebb . Mr . Marshall , working with the editor , has translated the stage work into a vibrant film . There's not a dull moment in this picture . From the very beginning it starts moving with the great score of songs that are so well known by now . Almost all the actors in the movie aren't known for their singing or dancing on the stage , or on films . Yet , under the direction of Mr . Marshall , they respond to the material incredibly well . Take Rene Zellweger , the Roxie Hart of the story . In her musical numbers she comes across as an accomplished singer who , unknown to us , can also act and charm the living daylight out of anyone . Miss Zellweger is a natural for this role . She never lets us down . This is acting at its best . Ms . Zellweger has such a sweet aura around her that we can only surrender to her magnetism . How about Catherine Zeta-Jones ? She's magnificent as Velma Kelly . She has curves that are unbelievable . Her singing and dancing skills were not what brought her into the world of films , yet , she manages to create this complex character . Ms . Zeta-Jones is a gorgeous woman who keeps getting better and better all the time . The greatest revelation is Richard Gere . He is an actor who should play the bad guy rather than the romantic lead most directors cast him in . When playing an evil person , he excels . His Billy Flynn is a triumph and credit , no doubt , has to go to Mr . Marshall , who knew his leading actor had it in him to give a fabulous performance and he can sing and dance on top of that . John C . Riley , wow ! He's an actor who never repeats himself . He has such a moldable face that no matter what film , or stage work he does , he makes the role his own . You never see this great actor give a fake performance as proven in all his recent work . His " Cellophane Man " is a show stopper . Had he done it on Broadway , he probably had to do it as an encore because he is the epitome of what the character is going through at the time . The other great surprise is Queen Latifa . She has such a great voice ! . It's a shame no one has created a film to showcase her talent . She has charm to spare ; her screen presence is incredible . Great work Mr . Marshall !
554999	1406078	373469	10.0	Calling Johnny Gossamer to action	The immensely likable novel " Bodies are where you find them " , written by Brett Halliday , has been adapted for the screen by Shane Black and the result is one of the funniest movies playing around . " Kiss Kiss Bang Bang " boasts an amazing dialog with some of the wittiest lines of any film in recent memory . The film pays a tremendous bonus to fans of the genre , which combines a detective story technique with some amusement and irony thrown in . The result is a fun time at the movies . Mr . Halliday pays tribute to those forgotten cheap pulp fiction novels that were so popular at one time in this country . The director has to be congratulated for combining the talents of two actors that pay off in unexpected ways . Robert Downey Jr . , one of the best film actors , is paired in this movie with Val Kilmer , who tends to play heavy roles , but has never been seen as he is shown in the movie . Both these men compliment one another in ways we didn't expect . The chemistry between them seems to indicate these two actors had a lot of fun while making the film , as it shows in the way they play against one another . Lovely Michelle Monaghan is seen as Harmony , a beautiful young hopeful working her way up in Hollywood . Also in the cast Corbin Bernsen , who is seen as Harlan Dexter . Larry Miller has a few brief moments in the picture . " Kiss Kiss Bang Bang " is a witty and intelligent film . Thanks to its director , Shane Black , it's a film to be treasured .
555581	1406078	378194	10.0	Don't mess around with The Bride	Quentin Tarantino's conclusion of the " Kill Bill " films is nothing short of brilliant . He makes it clear he is a master of this genre . In fact , this new film can stand on its own , as far as the story goes . It makes perfect sense in more ways than the first installment where there was more action , but perhaps the narrative is not as clear as in this one . Mr . Tarantino is greatly helped by his choice of Uma Thurman to play his heroine . As with the other film , Ms Thurman demonstrates she is up to the task of battling whatever enemies who dare come her way . The casting is excellent . David Carradine , Michael Parks , Michael Madsen , Darryl Hannah , Bo Svenson , Gordon Liu , and the rest of the crew play well under the guidance of Quentin Tarantino . A satisfying time at the movies .
554836	1406078	265086	10.0	War is hell	This film is more realistic than the tepid pictures that were produced in the Hollywood of World War II . You have to give credit to the director , Ridley Scott , to come out with a winning movie that is totally engrossing and that keeps you at the edge of your seat all the time . The only sad part is that we never get to know the feelings on the Somali people that battled the American power to the bitter end . So in that sense , this film is a one-sided account of what went on , told to us from the American viewpoint , which is well and good , but we never get to hear from the other side , except the short scene from one of the Somali warlord and General Garrison . This film is released right smack at the height of the Afghanistan conflict in which Americans are facing " the evil enemy " , according to our president . In the case of the Somalian involvement , it was supposedly to help the Somalis regain peace from the warlords that dominated the country . The parallel with the war in Afghanistan is somehow similar as we are still battling the same type of enemy in a divided country , dominated as was Somalia by warlords that are more interested in the domination of the poor and defenseless people than in achieving democracy and freedom for the people of the country . What doesn't make sense at all is why didn't the Black Hawks attack from the air the thousands up in the roof , thus providing cover to the troops on the ground . In fact , the whole nature of the fighting is a bit of a puzzlement because if the intention was to kidnap the kingpins of the conflict , we only succeeded in putting our troops in harm's way and to have 19 men killed , when maybe they would have had a better chance if they had better cover from the same Black Hawks the enemy keep downing . The cast is very good . I never did like Josh Hartnett , and frankly , he is not a good actor . He doesn't show any emotion . The rest of the cast is great with actors of the stature of Tom Sizemore , Ewan McGregor , Eric Bana , William Fitchner and the rest . As an ensemble they interact very well and you believe they are the people involved in the original conflict . The gory details of war are realistically handled . The script by Ken Nolan serves the director very well even though , as pointed out at the beginning it's only one-sided , since the enemy then , as it is now is composed of people , as presented in the film , so horrible , they're very easy to hate . In spite to these misgivings , the film is so fast paced that almost 2 hours and a half pass by so quickly , we don't even feel it's that long . Mr . Scott gives us here his own take of the Somalian conflict in very cinematic terms .
554702	1406078	420313	10.0	Hit the road !	" Wanderlust " , the interesting documentary Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini directed , is one of the best things about the role of road movies in our culture . This most American form of entertainment can be found in films from other countries , but it's the American vast landscape , which gives films of this genre the appeal and the significance that translates so well in movies made by some of the best creators in the business . The road movie's origins can be traced to the early westerns as the country expanded from East to West . Those early movies with the caravans of pioneers heading to settle the rest of the country , can be seen as a typical example of this phenomenon . Another example of this type of wanderlust is the migration of the thirties as people looked for other places that were a bit more hospitable . " Wanderlust " succeeds in the interviews with some of the best creators of this particular style of movie making . We hear from Dennis Hopper , whose " Easy Rider " , and others , typify the restlessness of the people taking the road . Allison Anders , another director that has set her stories that way , speaks intelligently about what is behind it all . Callie Khouri , Chris Eyre , Alexander Payne , Wim Wenders , Sam Shepard , Gus Van Sant and all the others contribute to make clear as to why we are all attracted to the road and what it all means to them . This excellent film was presented by IFC . Directors Berman and Pulcini have to be congratulated in producing this wonderful and informative documentary .
555251	1406078	257360	10.0	As good as he gets !	The Warren Schmidt of Jack Nicholson is a man who has lived all his life in a fog . Even as he is ready to retire at the beginning of the film , it appears that life went through him , but he never had a life . Alexander Payne has created a portrait of a mediocre man who , might be living in Omaha , but for all practical purposes , he might be living in Mars ! . Does he ever know his wife ? Even though they've been married for 42 years , they are at different wave lengths . How about his daughter ? . This girl is a selfish creature who only cares about her own wedding plans that might be shattered . Helen Schmidt , Warren's wife , has made a home for her family , but did she ever understand this man ? For that matter , did Warren realize that he had a wife and built-in maid all in one ? Like in all marriages , there are annoying things that Helen did that Warren resents . She is a typical house wife from the old school and values in an ever changing world . Warren , being in his own world , discovers a dark secret that challenges the happy memory of Helen . It's very hard to conceive this Schmidt without Jack Nicholoson . This might be his greatest achievement of a distinguished career . He is pure perfection as this man who goes in search of himself and to reconnect with a daughter that couldn't care less about him . Visiting his daughter's future family , the Herzels , Warren's world collapses around him . After all , he and Helen lived normal lives . Being a guest in Roberta's house proves to be too much for him . Kathy Bates is , without a doubt , right on the money with her portrayal of Roberta Herzel . Just look at her around the dinner table to realize how good an actress she is . The rest of the cast is excellent . Hope Davis as the daughter brings the right amount of selfishness to her Jeannie Schmidt . We have known people like her . Her role is typical of many a bride who wants to have a full wedding from parents like hers . Dermot Mulroney is very effective as the groom . He's as creepy as his hairdo . He and Jeannie will probably end up in divorce in a few years , but she will have the album , the videos and the party to remember her fifteen minutes of fame in Denver . For Jack Nicholson watchers , just wait for the last sequence of the film after he gets home to understand we are watching is a lesson in acting . Warren Schmidt at last connects with reality in a manner that only this great actor only could .
556481	1406078	492506	10.0	Playing with words	This delightful documentary , directed by Patrick Creadon , is a dream come true for people that enjoy to solve crossword puzzles . It centers around Will Shortz , the current New York Times editor , who has revolutionized the way we do the puzzles today . The film was co-written by Christine O'Malley , who with the director , takes us to meet some of the people behind the scenes . We must make a confession from the start , we are one of those addicted to solving the daily crosswords in the paper . The New York Times puzzles are the best of all the ones published by any newspaper . Of course , we are not in the league of the likes of Tyler Hinman , Trip Payne , or Al Sanders , who were the three finalist in the 2005 competition , but we are happy with just the idea of solving them every morning . There are many personalities that speak about their addiction to the crosswords of the New York Times . Among them , we hear from former President Bill Clinton , a man that has always been notorious for his quick mind . David Okrent , the former public editor of the Times , makes a surprise appearance . Jon Stewart is also funny in the way he deals with clues and how he blames Will Shortz when he doesn't get them . Mike Mussina , The Indigo Girls , Bob Dole , and other celebrities also are seen . The great fun of " Wordplay " is watching a master constructor of the stature of Merl Reagle creating a daily crossword right in front of the camera , and explaining the logic behind it . There is a funny moment when Ellen Ripstein , a former winner , tells us that in spite of having won , she keeps going every year to participate in the tournament . Her performance in the entertainment part of the competition brings a light and goofy moment to the film . The only thing we don't get too much of is the master himself . Will Shortz appears all too briefly as the emphasis of the documentary seems to be the annual competition at the Marriott in Stamford . Some of Mr . Shortz observations are funny , especially when he shares his typical weekly correspondence from frustrated people that are " puzzled " by his clues . " Wordplay " is a film that will resonate more with crossword puzzle lovers , but it is a fun movie to sit through because the witty material and the pace it was given by its creators .
555924	1406078	25493	10.0	Let's go to Maxim's	The great Ernst Lubitsch clearly understood the material in which " The Merry Widow " was based . Being European himself , he clearly identified with this delightful Franz Lehar operetta that had been charming audiences throughout the years . Mr . Lubitsch places the action in the small country of Marshovia , in central Europe . The director had an eye for the great spectacle he presents for us . Mr . Lubitsch greatest achievement is that he seems to have his camera waltzing all the time . The result is an amazing triumph for MGM . In fact , the glorious sets one admires in the film are breathtaking . For a film made in 1934 , the art directors , Cedric Gibbons and Gabriel Scognamillo recreate the royal palace of Marshovia in amazing detail , as well as the Paris scenes with an elegance and good taste that shows the resources of the studio that didn't spare anything . The black and white cinematography of Oliver Marsh enhances the Lubitsch style . Adrian's gowns look luxurious and the editing of the film by Francis Marsh give the film continuity without ever making the action appear forced or staged . The pairing of Maurice Chevalier and Jeanette MacDonald was an match that seems to have been made in haven . Both actors are a delight to see . Mr . Chevalier with his French accent and mannerisms make his Count Danilo the charmer he is . The beautiful Ms . MacDonald is mysterious at first , when we meet her , then as she has fallen in love , changes her attitude and realizes Danilo is the man for her . The secondary roles are played with great panache by the genial Edward Everett Horton , who as the ambassador to Paris , is under orders to have Sonia , the wealthy woman , accept Danilo and return to Marshovia with all her money . George Barber plays the King Achmed and the incomparable Una Merkel is seen as Queen Dolores . The Merry Widow waltz received a great production number in which about a hundred couples are seen dancing around Sonia and Danilo , first in white tuxedos and gowns and later in black ones . Later all the couples are mixed together creating such a rich moment . By today's standards that sequence couldn't have been done , or it must have cost a fortune , or perhaps would have digitally mastered in order not to pay dancers to appear dancing in the movie . Let's just be thankful there was a man with a vision , Ernst Lubitsch , and let's be grateful for his vision and his legacy .
554795	1406078	369702	10.0	The right to die with dignity	Alejandro Amenabar , the young and talented Spanish director , clearly shows us he is a serious film maker . Anyone doubting it , should have a look at his latest film " The Sea Inside " . This is a movie that has been rewarded with numerous accolades , not only in Spain , but throughout the world , wherever this wonderful movie has been shown . If you have not seen the film , perhaps you would like to stop here . Ramon Sampedro is a man confined to bed . Being quadriplegic , he depends on the kindness of strangers for everything . Since his accident , Ramon only thinks in one thing alone : how to end his life ! This is the moral issue at the center of the story , based on the real Ramon Sampedro's life . Mr . Amenabar tells the story from Ramon's point of view . There is nothing here that is false or manipulative on his part . After all , he relies on facts that were well known in his country as this case became a " cause celebre " in favor of euthanasia , a theme that no one in that country wanted to deal with in Spain . With its background of being a predominantly Roman Catholic country , Spain has evolved into one of the most democratic societies in Europe , a distinction that is more notable because of its long years dominated by a dictator . Yet , in spite of the advances in that society , the idea of taking one's own life , is something not clearly understood by the majority of its citizens , who still considered this subject as something that could not be done in their country . Ramon Sampedro was a man that loved life . He lived an intense life as a young man when he enlisted as a sailor to discover the world . Having no money , this was the only way for him to see other lands , experience other cultures . Ramon's love affair with the sea , is something that people in Galicia learn to love from their childhood . Imagine how that same friendly sea is the one that takes away Ramon's life , as he knew it ! In a second , Ramon goes from a vibrant young man into a vegetable ! Ramon's family is shattered by the experience . Suddenly they must leave everything aside to take care of him at home . His brother and sister-in-law , are stoic people that deal with the situation as a matter of fact . Their lives become something of an afterthought , because Ramon's life comes first . They tend to the sick man without protesting , or blaming Ramon for the sacrifices they must make to keep him alive . That is why , in their minds , the Sampedros can't comprehend Ramon's wishes to end it all . Haven't they given up having a normal life to take care of him ? This moral issue weighs heavily on these uncomplicated and simple people because in their minds , they are doing what came naturally . The second subject of the movie is the legal issue of the euthanasia and the well meaning people that suddenly enter Ramon's life in their desire to help him put an end to his suffering . There's Julia , the lawyer who is herself handicapped and suffers from a rare malady . There is Rosa , the fish cannery worker who becomes infatuated with Ramon . Javier Bardem , makes a brilliant Ramon Sampedro . His transformation is total . We don't doubt from one moment he is no one else but the paralyzed man on that bed . Mr . Bardem can only use his face in order to convey all the emotions trapped inside Ramon . Mr . Bardem makes this man real . This is perhaps Javier Bardem's best role of his career . He surpasses his own award winning performance as Reynaldo Arenas , the late Cuban poet he portrayed in " Before Night Falls " . In the supporting roles , Belen Rueda , makes an impressive appearance as Julia , the woman fighting her own physical problems . Lola Duenas is also effective as Rosa , the kindred soul that loves Ramon deeply . Celso Bugallo , as Ramon's brother shows a man at a crossroads of his own life . Mabel Rivera makes a compassionate Manuela , the sister-in-law that never asks anything of life , but tends to Ramon without questioning why she has to do it , at all . Mr . Amenabar also has composed the haunting music score for the film . He is a man that never cease to surprise . One wonders what his next project will be , but one wishes him success in whatever he might decide to do in the future .
556333	1406078	386032	10.0	HMOs and the health mess	For better , or worse , Michael Moore , is the " enfant terrible " of the American documentary . " Sicko " , his latest effort , presents his views on a terrible , and sad , phase of this country's health care . Mr . Moore's role has always been to provoke , in order to awake people to pay attention of his latest crusade . As such , " Sicko " , is part fact and part entertainment . One of the most effective part of the documentary is the conversation between Richard Nixon , the then president who is partly responsible for the mess this country is in matters of health care , and his aide John Ehrliman as they discuss the problem . Another great moment arrives when a witty Hillary Rodham Clinton is about to be grilled by Dick Armey in Congress at the height of the Clinton health plan . She outsmarts this once powerful man with her wit and dry sense of humor . In a way , one has been told about the problem with the health systems in different countries , Canada , being the best example . In order to dispel fears , Mr . Moore embarks in a journey to explore the myth and the result seems to he in his favor . Other countries are examined as well , England , and France , countries where if one is to believe the people interviewed , seem to have excellent health plans deal that give people a handle on this important problem . These systems aren't inexpensive . To keep these plans alive , the European societies are heavily taxed to cover the free medical coverage . The most fun in the film involves the Cuban episode , where Mr . Moore decides to take a few people with medical problems to Guantanamo naval base , where if one hears the Washington politicians , the so-called terrorists are treated much better than regular American citizens . After not being admitted in the base , Mr . Moore must find a ride to Havana to bring his patients for treatment for their different ailments . Of course , this sequence is not real because we know of people with Cuban relatives who must send medicines to Cuba because of the lack of it in the island , despite of what is given freely to these visitors Mr . Moore brings to the biggest hospital in Havana . That's the most unrealistic part of the film , as far as we are concerned . Having had the experience of being hospitalized and incurring the high price for the care received , seems almost an indecent price one has to pay in order to be well in America . The documentary ends in a funny note as we watch Mr . Moore climbing the steps of the capitol to bring his dirty laundry for the congress to clean .
556495	1406078	227277	10.0	Angel and Nene	Marcelo Pineyro , one of the best directors from Argentina , surprises with every new effort . Working on this film with Marcelo Figueras , he also contributed to bring Ricardo Piglia's novel to the screen with unexpected results . The novel was based on a real criminal case that happened in Buenos Aires in the 1960's . The two men at the center of the story are gay lovers who happened to be criminals . These two men share a passion that comes across on the screen like no other in recent memory . Angel , the Spaniard , wants to go to New York and Nene , his lover , wants to comply , but first they must attend to the assault of a vehicle that brings money to one bank . During the heist Angel is shot on his shoulder . Things are so hot for all the people involved , they flee to Uruguay . This was perhaps a miscalculation , because they are being followed by the Argentine police , that is working with local authorities in apprehending all the criminals . Nene is restless . He decides to leave the safe house , and finds Giselle , a beautiful woman who falls in love with him . At this point , we are of two minds , is Nene really cheating on Angel , or is he trying to use Giselle into providing another place where they can hide ? The violent end comes in a finale that doesn't have anything to envy to any other movies of the genre . The best thing in the film are the two leads . Leonardo Sbaraglia is one of the best actors that have come out of Argentina lately . He does an amazing job in portraying Nene . Eduardo Noriega , is also a Spanish actor that has done excellent work before and he shows his range in a magnificent performance as Angel . Leticia Bredice is Giselle , the young woman in Montevideo who befriends , then fall in love with Nene . The film proves Marcelo Pineyro is a voice to be reckoned with and who has an enormous talent for giving his audience his best .
555484	1406078	94986	10.0	The letter	The fourth commandment is loosely adapted by Kryzsztof Kieslowski into a compelling tale about a secret that has been kept for a long time . In the hands of another man , the material would have probably been a disaster , but Mr . Kieslowski , a man with a great insight , makes an amazing job in keeping real and credible . The theme is " Honor thy father and mother " . Anka , a student of dramatic art , who lives with her widower father , Michal , in the same apartment block , as the rest of the people that surface in " The Decalogue " lives a normal life . Michal , the father , who is going abroad for a short trip , remembers at the airport he has forgotten to pay a bill and asks Anka to do it for him as soon as she gets back home . When Anka , arrives home , she discovers an envelope in a drawer of her father's desk marked " To be opened after my death " . The message triggers great curiosity on her , as she wants to know what could be such a secret her father wants to tell her from the beyond . The discovery of not being Michal's real daughter hits her like a ton of bricks . She can't imagine how could this man , who up to a few hours ago she thought was her father , could suddenly change the picture . Michal is surprised to find Anka at the airport at his return . She is frantic because of what she perceives as a deception . Anka doesn't take into consideration , for one moment , the enormous sacrifice Michal has gone through raising her without the help of a mother to guide Anka as she grows and matures . For a moment Anka's reaction acquires a shade of incest , because one can see it's possible she has loved Michal in a different way . By way of explanation , Michal , tells Anka , he was going to reveal the secret when Anka was a young girl , but for some reason , he thought it was the wrong moment . The second time he had tried to tell her the truth , he ended up keeping it within himself . As far as he knows , Anka is his daughter and that's all there is to it . His fatherly love has never ceased . Adrianna Biedrzniski , and Janusz Gajos are wonderful as Anka and Michal . Under Kieslowski's guidance these two actors bring to life characters that find themselves facing a crisis that has the potential of separating them forever . One feels for Michal , but it's easy to see how betrayed Anka must feel upon learning the truth .
555712	1406078	28950	10.0	Class consciousness	Jean Renoir was a man behind this masterpiece of the French cinema . It stands as an anti-war document by itself . The incredible DVD version looks as great today , perhaps , as when the original film was released . The screen play by M . Renoir and Charles Spaak was the original model , which many other films that came later , copied and profited from . " La Grande Illusion " presents us a group of men that come together because of the war . If there were no war , none of these men would have met , let alone , would ever have crossed paths in real life . The top brass in the European armies were headed by the aristocracy . These rich classes only intermingled with their peers ; they only gave orders to their subordinates . WWII changed all that ! M . Renoir gets excellent acting from the three principals . Jean Gabin , as Lt . Marechal , shows why he was one of France's best actors . Pierre Fresnay , the aristocratic French Capt . Boeldieu , and Erich Von Stroheim , as Capt . Von Rauffenstein , his German counterpart , are amazing in the film . Together with " The Rules of the Game " , this film will always be one of the most cherished French films of all time .
555540	1406078	426508	10.0	Charles Busch , a class act !	During the last quarter of the 20th century , New York saw the arrival of artists of the caliber of Charles Ludlum and Charles Busch . These men's love for the movies that had shaped their youth , started their own views of those idols when they established companies that capitalized on the type of ' ridiculous ' theater where they , in turn , reinterpreted the way those larger than life figures influenced them . While Charles Ludlum , the creator of the Theater of the Ridiculous , passed away at the peak of his creative years , Charles Busch went on to establish himself as one of the best exponents of this genre . Charles Busch's humble beginnings can be traced to his days at the Limbo Lounge where he and his friends would perform for his followers , most of whom were gay , and who really appreciated Mr . Busch's humor . It wasn't until the Establishment press , by way of a New York Times reporter , wrote about what Charles Busch and his clan were creating , that New Yorkers embraced this new type of hilarious insanity . Charles Busch's biggest hit was " Vampire Lesbians of Sodom " , a play that established him and his collaborators as legitimate exponents of this new form of theater . All this is the basis of this wonderful documentary shown recently on the Sundance Channel . As directed by John Catania and Charles Ignacio , we are taken to hear first hand by Charles Busch and his close friends and members of his group what it was all about . Mr . Busch is a kind man whose contributions have brought joy and entertainment to theater lovers . In the film we hear first hand accounts by Theresa Aceves , Kenneth Elliott , Julie Halston , Carl Andres , and others about what it was to be associated to Mr . Busch from those obscure days to the present . We also see interviews by such personalities as Boy George , Michael Musto , Paul Rudnick , Rosie O'Connell , Kathleen Turner , and B . D . Wong , among others where they give praise to an unique voice in the New York scene : Charles Busch !
556325	1406078	292963	10.0	A botched robbery	Sidney Lumet , one of the best directors working today , has come out with one of the best films of his career . This crime movie , written by Kelly Masterson , packs a lot of action in its 123 minutes of running time . Mr . Lumet who hasn't had a big success with any of his movies lately , vindicates himself with this tale of murder in suburbia . The story is being told from different angles and perspectives giving another layer of texture to the film . Andy , who we first meet having sex with his wife in a Brazilian hotel , is a man of huge appetites . He has an expensive drug habit which he subsidizes with moneys from the company in which he is an executive of sorts . Andy finds himself in a position which doesn't let him a lot of leeway if he is to keep his love for drugs , and to keep his cheating wife . His brother , Hank , is quite the opposite of Andy , a born loser . Andy has plans to involve his sibling in his get rich scheme . That's why Andy devises a plot to hold up a store in a suburban mall . He enlists Hank to execute the operation . The only trouble is that the jewelry store they plan to hit belongs to his and Hank's own parents . Bobby , a hit man , is enlisted to help Hank do the robbery , but things do not go according to plan . As the pair proceeds to the store , Hank is to stay outside as Bobby scares the salesman . The only problem is that Hank's own mother Nanette , is the one that has come to the store and she is not afraid using a gun , killing Bobby , but she is wounded in action . This duo's father , Charles , is besides himself when he learns about the botched robbery and his own wife's being badly hurt . After she dies , Charles decides to look himself into the case . He is appalled when he realizes the truth ; he wants to get to the bottom of it , no matter who it hurts . Little does he realize the gravity of what has been perpetrated against him by his own sons . Philip Seymour Hoffman is Andy , the heartless man whose mind is dominated by the drugs he consumes . This actor is a joy to watch . He never repeats himself from film to film . He is worth the price of admission . Equally effective is Ethan Hawke , the brother that didn't amount to much and whose own life is in turmoil after the messy divorce to Martha . He can't even give his own daughter money for a school outing to see a play ! Making another great appearance , Albert Finney is excellent as a father that is horrified by the actions of his sons . It's no wonder Mr . Finney has lasted as long as he has because of his intelligence and his honesty in giving always his best . Marisa Tomei also makes a great Gina , the wife that is cheating her own husband with his own brother ! Amy Wright impresses in a minor role and so does Bryan O'Byrne with the small pivotal part as Bobby . Rosemary Harris has nothing to do , unfortunately . The film is a treat for all the fans of Mr . Lumet who shows once again why he has remain one of the most interesting men in the movies .
