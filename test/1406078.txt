556597	1406078	66184	1.0	Leaving Las Vegas	It's unimaginable that George Stevens , the distinguished director that gave us " Swing Time " , " Shane " , " Giant " , among others , could have agreed to be associated with this dud ! I vaguely remember the Frank D . Gilroy's play , in which this movie is based , as a not too interesting night in the theater . Well , with the help of the author , the film was made under Mr . Stevens direction , and the results are there for anyone to judge ! The worst thing in the film is the running time ! At 113 minutes , it's way too long . The two principals are so miscast that it pains the viewer to watch them go through the motions feigning to love one another when probably the stars ended up hating each other for the duration of the shoot that took almost three months to be completed . Elizabeth Taylor was into one of her fatty periods while doing this movie . One only sees her in unflattering costumes that don't do anything for her . Those shmattes make her even look older and heavier , but Liz must have thought she was making a fashion statement , or who knows what went through her mind ? Warren Beatty is seen in the film as though he were under the influence . His take on Joe Grady , as directed , seems the kind of man that would be a turn off for Fran . After all , she was having a thing with a rich man who kept her in some kind of luxury . Mr . Beatty doesn't do anything to get us to like him . He is a loser , and that's that . Watch this film on a sleepless night . Maybe it'll provoke you to sleep and have great dreams about what this movie is not !
555231	1406078	426190	1.0	The king of Viagra	Some comments to this forum are from people that relate to the story being connected to Cuba , in some way , or another . Their comments don't take into consideration how badly the material used for the film plays on the screen . The character of Don Arturo , the Spaniard that goes to Havana to get married to the young and luscious Yoli , rings false from the start . It is clear the heavy makeup used on this person shows the man is fake . We realize why right away as we are being put on . Later on , as Papito decides to impersonate the older man : one realizes they are the same person , which goes to ask viewers to stretch their imaginations in accepting this phony premise to begin with . Director / writer Alexis Valdes take on the material makes this a one joke story stretched to the max without any surprises . Not only that , the acting is amateur , at best . This was a film made and financed in Spain , and as Spanish films go , " Un Rey en La Habana " is a poor excuse of a movie .
554744	1406078	270911	1.0	I won't forgive you , Dawg !	Whatever good intentions were behind this film , they are lost in the finished product . Never having seen it before , we took a chance because of Denis Leary , a talented actor , caught in the middle of this insipid comedy . As directed by Victoria Hochberg , this film doesn't go anywhere . The worst thing going for the film is Elizabeth Hurley . As Anna , we figured out immediately she ties in with the childhood scene at the beginning of the film . The premise to seek redemption from all the women Doug has been mean to , is ridiculous at best . The two stars have no charisma in their scenes together . Laughter is absent from this movie . Denis Leary has done much better and it's hard to imagine what might have attracted to a script that doesn't do anything for Mr . Leary's resume . A film to be watched at the viewer's own peril .
554838	1406078	245046	3.0	They won't always have Paris . . .	Whatever you think of this misguided and silly film , please don't tell Mary Louis Parker , Billy Crudup's girlfriend , he stunk big time in this disaster because she might not like you , and hit you , the same way she hit some fan who was bad-mouthing Billy in his last stage appearance in New York . Whatever was Cate Blanchett thinking when she accepted the title role in this stupid little number ? No one can believe for a moment all the goings and comings the screenwriter has plotted at the expense of truth and reality . I'm afraid that our Cate really has to have her little head examined and maybe one day she'll fess up the real reasons for getting near this project that makes absolute no sense at all , let alone the preposterous situation which situates " la Blanchett " in that God forsaken little town where she sticks out like a sore thumb . Billy Crudup is totally out of place in the company of people like Michael Gambon , or even Cate . His character is totally unbelievable and we cannot think of him as the brains behind all the work against the invading Nazi army . Sorry Ms . Armstrong , better luck next time . We have admired your work before , but films like these are beneath your best abilities . Try to get involved in an Australian theme , one that you're more familiar with , and give us something more dignified than Charlotte Gray , who , by the way , doesn't even have to change her name at all because no one could have cared less if she was Gray , Brown , Green , Black , Blue , Black , or just plain Jane Doe !
554562	1406078	424345	4.0	Minimum wagers	If success is measured by the size of an audience , or by the amount of laughs a film produces , then " Clerks II " could be deemed a failure . Judging by the reaction at a screening at the Angelika the other day , where the film is playing in two of the biggest theaters , and the couple of feeble laughs it provoked in an audience of less than thirty people , this movie is definitely not a winner . But never fear , Kevin Smith , a clever man , has made sure the film will resonate with the people that will go see the film based on their experience with the original " Clerks " , a much better , and wittier film than its successor proves to be . In many ways , sequels should be avoided because nothing can compare with the previous work , a lesson Mr . Smith should have applied to this misguided attempt to bring back the people of the first film for a reunion . Jeff Anderson , without a doubt , is what holds the movie together . His Randal is still irreverent and foul mouthed . On the other hand , Brian O'Hallaran doesn't fare better with his Dante . In fact , he seemed to be out of it throughout most of the film . The addition of Rosario Dawson , as the manager of Mooby's was a good idea . The cameo appearance of the incomparable Wanda Sykes , as the offended black customer , proves to be one of the highlights of the movie . What doesn't work out in this sequel is the big musical production number of " ABC " with choreography in the parking lot . Kevin Smith , who plays Silent Bob again , and Jason Mewes , who returns as Jay seem like an old joke gone bad . Time has not been kind to them , in spite of the fact they are still dealing " nickel bags " outside of Mooby's and making a lot of money with the profits from selling drugs . " ClerksII " seems to be targeted for an age group that thinks whatever Kevin Smith gives them is the Bible . One wonders how did the Weinstein brothers , who backed this film and only deal with sure hits , came to the conclusion this was going to make them a fortune and be a big successful picture . Best advice to future movie goers is to wait for the DVD .
555891	1406078	347474	4.0	Chronicle of boredom in Catalonia	One wonders how director Marc Recha's films make it to Cannes . Evidently someone thinks he must be the Enfant Terrible of Catalonian films , or something like that , at the expense of real talented directors that don't get the chance to go and make the scene in Cannes in May . At any rate , this film makes no sense . It's as slow as the other film I saw by this " genius " before . This came as part of the yearly festival of Spanish Films at the Walter Reade . We are led to believe the cream of the crop is being shown , but after seeing this " masterpiece " about boredom and strange lives in a small town , we shall be more careful in selecting anything directed by this man in the near future .
556506	1406078	289319	4.0	Entertaining the troops	Franco is dying and most of the military men were panicking because of the uncertain future under the monarchy . The story centers around a military base in North Africa where the peace is abruptly interrupted by the arrival of a theater troupe from the mainland . These military men , being isolated from women from home , suddenly become excited by the prospect of having so many beautiful show business girls among their midst . The colonel in charge , becomes infatuated with Gloria , a woman of a certain age , who is the principal attraction of the visiting thespians . His aide , Pecinas , also finds in Chichi , a woman to share his sexual fantasies . Chichi wants to try the local dope and is instrumental for Pecinas to help her with a plan of her own . The film is a silly comedy that doesn't go anywhere . In fact , for a comedy that takes place in 1975 , the drug culture was something that was not everywhere , as it is these days . It doesn't make sense to have Chichi asking Pecinas for dope the first moment they meet . As a comedy , the film has occasional laughs and relies on the coarse way most people talk in the movie .
554530	1406078	202623	5.0	Date interrupted by a man with a glass menagerie	Jordan Brady tries hard to make this comedy work . This screen play was written by Jay Locopo , who also appears in it . The film shows a director that wants to please his audience . Mr . Brady has assembled a young group of performers in " The Third Wheel " , which was backed by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon , who also are seen in the movie . The nerdy Stanley finally is able to get Diana to go out with him and this serves to create the kind of curiosity his office friends are betting on . Would he succeed in making Diana see him for what he is really like , or would she be turned off by the way Stanley acts ? The date turns out to be something that Stanley didn't bargain for . As Stanley and Diana are on the way to the theater , they encounter turbulence along the way when a homeless man , Phil walks in front of the car and is hit . Phil will stay with the couple throughout the rest of the movie . At times , this homeless man can be annoying beyond words ! Take the scene when Diana and Stanley finally get to the theater for the second act of the boring play in the park . Who happens to come out on stage ? Well , you guessed it : Phil ! This man delivers a monologue so inane , but everyone in the place goes nuts about him . One wonders about those L . A . audiences . . . Hmm ! Denise Richards gives a low key performance as Diana . Luke Wilson is Stanley . Jay Locopo is seen as Phil . Ben Affleck and Matt Damon also show up in small roles . The best thing is the last minutes when the credits are rolling . Stay for that , or better yet , fast forward to that and then go back to the beginning !
555829	1406078	118239	5.0	Not ecstatic !	Mariano Barroso , the director of this film doesn't break any new ground with it . Perhaps because the screen play he wrote with Joaquin Oristell doesn't hold any surprises for the viewer . No doubt there might have been good ideas as a project , but as it plays on the screen , it loses its viewers early on . Naturally , the only interest in watching this Spanish feature were Javier Bardem and Federico Luppi , two of the most interesting actors working in the cinema these days . But alas , nothing makes much sense , or really grabs the viewer's attention . The mercurial theater director , Daniel , played by Mr . Luppi fares much better than Bardem , whose appearance will not add anything to his fine work in better films than this . Watch it at your own risk .
554532	1406078	317198	5.0	Weight watcher , NOT !	Beeban Kidron , shame on you ! How could they have given you the task of directing this turkey ? , or should we re-phrase it , how could you have assented to direct this porker of a movie ! Remember " Antonia and Jane " ? Where did you go wrong ? Well , right at the beginning of the film , there's a metaphor about things to come . When Bridget Jones parachutes down into the sty full of pigs and gets her derriere smeared in what's at the bottom of it : were the film makers trying to tell us this is indeed a stinker ? The problem with the movie is that for whatever reasons , Renee Zellweger overdid her research for the role of Bridget by eating her way into becoming what the author , Ms . Fielding , didn't probably have in mind . Yes , Bridget Jones is obsessed with her weight , but give me a break , she is by no means a fatso ! She might gain a pound here and there , but she always loses , or at least , she tries to . Not this woman we see on the screen . One can only hope the British cast got paid lots of money for being in the picture . Then again , there are things like this film that are better left alone , as it will add nothing to anyone's C . V . !
555008	1406078	117582	5.0	Sabotage	" The Secret Agent " , a novel by Joseph Conrad , had already been adapted for the screen . Alfred Hitchcock's 1936 film seems a masterpiece in comparison with this attempt by Christopher Hampton of a remake . Although both films are not exactly alike , this new version seems to suffer from a short vision that results in an uneven film . The first problem with this film appears to be the casting of Patricia Arquette in the pivotal role of Winnie . Her accent is wrong and the obvious age difference between her and Verloc doesn't help the film . It's curious to note that Mr . Hampton has done much better work as a screen writer as well as his work for the stage . Nothing of that talent is in clear evidence in the film . The film makers were lucky to get all the talent in the cast . Unfortunately the material doesn't suit Gerard Depardieu , or Robin Willimas , a good actor when he wants to do serious work , but not here . Bob Hoskins , Jim Broadbent , Christian Bale , Eddie Izzard and the great Elizabeth Spriggs , do all they can to make the film better , without much success .
555661	1406078	281820	6.0	Bob le Flambeur this is not !	I have seen every film directed by Neil Jordan . Being a big fan of his , I didn't want to miss this one . Well , it was the big disappointment of my life . This remake of Bob le Flambeur is horribly directed and acted . The last sequence is just about the best thing of this film , but as for the rest , it was just mediocre , at best . The idea of putting together these many characters in the Riviera was probably a great thought , but then , the many actors of different nationalities and backgrounds prove to be a hindrance to the story . If one can get over the accent problem , then there is the sound track of this film , which was so hard to hear at all , at least in the theater where I saw it , that you have a double hurdle to get over . Nick Nolte with his hair dyed a carrot hue looks hideous ; he probably was going through a bad period when he made this movie . His take on Bob is fitting with the character's spiral descent into hell because of his drug problem , no doubt . But he is also hard to understand since he whispers and mumbles most of the time . A little more clarity would have helped . The last moments of the film are very well executed , but as caper films go , this picture doesn't contribute anything to the genre . Sorry Mr . Jordan , better luck next time out . Maybe leave remakes to mediocre directors . You could not improve in the original one , so why even bother ?
556118	1406078	109456	6.0	Is it really Willis ' Willis ?	The director's cut , no pun intended , seems to be a much better film than the one that was shown commercially , but it still is a far cry from a satisfactory movie to watch . Richard Rush could have done better , but the psychological film we see , adds nothing to what has already been shown before . From the beginning we realize who the killer is , as well as the person with the multiple personality problem . It's too obvious ! The film relies heavily on the sexual attraction between Bill Capa and Rose . Much has been speculated in this forum about whether we are actually seeing Willis ' willis , or not . Since most male stars wouldn't be caught dead showing their genitals , for obvious reasons , what is seen for a second in the pool scene is that of a body double . On the other hand , we see Jane March showing it all , which is a welcome attraction . Only the final sequence has any impact . There are many things in the plot that don't add up and the viewer is ahead of the story at all times . Bruce Willis with a hairpiece looks good . Jane March has a better chance with the character she plays . Also Brad Dourif , Lance Henriksen have their moments . The one that doesn't come across well is Ruben Blades , an otherwise excellent actor trying to do a Columbo routine in this film .
556639	1406078	29842	6.0	Spaghetti a la Chinese	Archie Mayo's 1938 " The Adventures of Marco Polo " is an odd film to watch . Even giving it the benefit of the doubt , this misguided attempt to bring the legendary figure to the screen doesn't quite make it . Not even by a stretch of the imagination can we believe that the Chinese inhabitants of Cathay could look like these actors on the screen . John Cromwell and John Ford are not credited , but they must have been called as consultants to a losing enterprise that even these talented directors couldn't help fix . Robert Sherwood , a distinguished writer of better films , is responsible for writing the screen treatment , but frankly , his imprint is lacking in the finished product . Of course , times have changed and no Hollywood producer would dare to give this type of " entertainment " to today's audiences because they would be seen as ridiculous , at best . The film came out at a time when audiences were less sophisticated and more willing to accept stories such as this one . Even for a film produced by Samuel Goldwyn , this production looks tacky . It's obvious the people behind this film either had budget problems , or they didn't get the right art directors to improve the film . Gary Cooper , as Marco Polo , appears to be lost . The beautiful Sigrid Gurie is made out to look oriental to resemble this Princess Kukachin she is supposed to be . The only one that escapes the debacle is Basil Rathbone . His Ahmed is a villain , and he plays it with relish . George Truex , Alan Hale , H . B . Warner , are seen in minor roles . Watch this film as a curiosity , but don't expect too much .
555201	1406078	290160	6.0	Charlie Kate , Medicine Woman	Joan Micklin Silver , the director of this film has done better before . She must have been attracted to the material . The novel was much better , as usually is the case when the adaptation is from a book and not from a short story . The film is pleasant to watch , but it seems hollow in parts . Charlie Kate was a determined woman ; she gets rid of a husband that is a waste and sets up a domestic practice to help everyone that is sick . She had an innate sense for healing , as the man who she saves from being lynched tells her at the beginning of the film . Gena Rowlands is good as the indomitable Charlie Kate . When she has good material , this actress excels . The surprise of the film is without a doubt , Mimi Rogers , an actress that is far superior than others of her generation . Unfortunately , she doesn't get what she deserves . The rest of the cast is good too . This is a nostalgic look of America in the early 40s .
554651	1406078	155975	6.0	The Bates Motel	Gus Van Sant has distinguished himself in his career in the American cinema . Mr . Van Sant has been a man that is attracted to risky projects as proved by his films . That said , one can't imagine what made him undertake the direction of a definitive work such as " Psycho " , which doesn't need another interpretation . The film was based on Robert Bloch's novel which was adapted brilliantly for the screen by Joseph Stefano . Alfred Hitchcock , an original director , seemed to be the natural choice to direct the screen treatment . In fact , this film falls into a category that would seem easy to imitate , but no one can improve in what was already a masterpiece . This 1998 film follows its model closely , but somehow , it never jells . In a way , we are all prejudiced against any remake of anything , but this was sacrilege . Most of the original is presented following its model and perhaps it would have made a better film if instead of copying the Hitchcock movie , it would have been done differently . Then , at least , one would have gone along with that new rethinking of the novel , and new adaptation , but instead the viewer keeps comparing it against the excellent film Mr . Hitchcock left us . We had avoided watching this version , but thinking the original was going to be shown on a cable channel , it turned out to be the new one . Obviously , despite the harsh criticism , Gus Van Sant got over this bad decision and came back with other films worthy of his talent .
554711	1406078	166252	6.0	Sincerely yours ,	We avoided watching this movie when it was released commercially , even though we had read Cathleen Schine's novel in which this movie is based on . Director Peter Chan's take on the story looks good on the screen ; what with the picturesque setting of Rockford , Ma . , as the background and all the cute houses where the story takes place . The result is a film that is easy on the eye , but alas , like eating a Chinese dinner , it leaves us hungry for more . Helen , the owner of a book store , finds a letter between the cushions of the couch of the shop . She reads it , and it sounds intriguing , because the writer goes to express how deeply he feels for the person the letter has been sent to . Since it has no name , Helen assumes it has been intended for her alone . She believes Johnny , the young assistant , has sent it to her . The young man , who likes the older Helen , is only too happy to tell her how he feels about her . Basically , " The Love Letter " is a story about missed opportunities . Helen who was in love with George , the local chief firefighter , married someone else , but her marriage failed . George also is getting a divorce . George confesses he had gone away to New York when he was younger to get away from Helen and his life in town and he had also sent her a postcard from New York , which Helen had kept , but had not read the message inserted within the card . It's at this moment when Helen comes to her senses when she realizes her affair with Johnny is only a summer fling . The film will be liked by the audience for which it was targeted . Kate Capshaw , who produced the movie , is fine as Helen . Tom Everett Scott plays Johnny . Blythe Danner , Geraldine McEwen , Julianne Nicholson , Tom Selleck , Ellen DeGeneres , and the rest of the cast do good work also . The film has an ironic twist at the end when the real recipient of this letter is revealed .
554937	1406078	39951	6.0	The Paramount studio family	" Variety Girl " , a film from 1947 , showed up recently on cable . The film , which takes the theme of the Variety Club , which was a charitable organization involving well known movie people , is an excuse for showcasing the talent players employed by the studio . Paramount was at the time one of the most powerful places in which movies were made . As such , the idea behind this picture was to show how united and family-like the studio was . The story is paper thin . It presents an implausible situation about two young women trying to make it in the movie industry . They , like thousand other hopefuls , attracted by the glamour of Hollywood came to Los Angeles in droves to be discovered . This is exactly what Katherine Brown and Amber Lavonne try to do with amazing results . The fun in watching " Variety Girl " is recognizing stars , larger than life , being caught in the act of being themselves . Thus , we see the likes of Alan Ladd , Dorothy Lamour , Burt Lancaster , Lizabeth Scott , Barbara Stanwych , Gary Cooper , William Holden , William Bendix , and many others involved in either the show that takes the center of the story , or just around the studio , mixing with colleagues and extras . The funniest sequence involved Olga San Juan , who plays Amber , emoting to the high heavens just to be noticed by the many diners at the Brown Derby . Also the singing duo of Bing Crosby and Bob Hope in their rendition of Harmony . This is just an entertainment as conceived by the studio , no doubt . The best way to watch it is just to do so without expecting anything other than a smile . That way it will not disappoint .
555393	1406078	257076	6.0	L . A . subways	One wonders if the making of the Los Angeles subway system has been ordered by Hollywood , as more and more films are being shot in it lately . Before it was The Italian Job , now , it is S . W . A . T . Is there a metaphor ? Let the viewer decide and interpret . Clark Johnson has recruited a very interesting team to play the SWAT team , led by Samuel L . Jackson . His Hondo is a man that has seen it all and he takes no nonsense from his men . He takes a chance with Jim , who is damaged goods , because of a previous incident caused by his partner . Colin Farrell is very effective in his role of the wronged guy who is trying to redeem himself . The rest of the team is OK . They are all in this together to fight the villain , Alex Montel , played by Olivier Martinez . Why is Mr . Martinez shown always in such an unkempt way ? One can almost ' smell ' him . . . Obviously , he will never be a spokesperson for any men's fragrance in his native country . He needs an image consultant to get out of the bad guy stereotype that Hollywood has given him . The special effects , specially the Lear Jet landing at the bridge , are spectacular . The end is predictable as we know who is going to come out the winner . As summer films go , this was entertaining , even though it doesn't add anything new to the genre .
555430	1406078	187995	6.0	Stella	David Bailey , a well known photographer , tried his hand at directing by turning Brooke Leimas ' novel , which we read some time ago , into a mystery film . The screen play is by Jamie Brown , and it appears his adaptation is the basic flaw with the finished product . We are given a premise that has been used before with better results . The second wife who comes to live in an unhappy place where the ghost of a dead woman comes back to haunt the new wife and make her life impossible . After all , even from a grave , don't play with a woman's sense of possession , she will come back to haunt whoever dares . Stella , who is only seen by Catherine , a French young woman who has married Nick , a composer of music for the movies . Everything seems to go bad when strange things are happening in the couple's apartment . It doesn't help that most of Catherine's new friends seem to be in some sort of conspiracy of silence and will not tell her anything about the past and what kind of marriage Stella and Nick had together . Charlotte Gainsbourg is an actress that deserves better . Her Catherine shows some good moments , but like everyone else , she is bogged down by a scenario that doesn't make much sense . Natassja Kinski , plays the enigmatic neighbor that seems to know what is behind the things Catherine seems to be experiencing , but doesn't tell her . The rest of the cast don't have much to do .
554965	1406078	319769	6.0	Suntanned and unhappy	The Spanish film committee that chose this film over Pedro Almodovar's " Talk to her " to represent that country in the best foreign film at the Oscars , made a terrible a blunder . The rest is history : Hollywood preferred to honor the wronged man , and no one ever heard about this movie . It didn't get a commercial run in the United States , as far as I'm concerned , because it is a film that outside Spain has no great appeal . This film reminded me of a day at " Cheers " , the Boston bar where the TV series took place , but without one iota of humor . The atmosphere is so bleak that it depresses the viewer as this heavy tale the director , together with his screen writer , decides to present us about unemployment in Northern Spain . There is such a gloom in this film as in no other film in recent memory . A lighter tone would have greatly improved this static film . The film , as directed by Fernando Leon , shows not a ray of hope for these idled workers who spend their days at the bar where they are able to get drinks on credit while they wait for better days . This bunch prefer to stay in a state of limbo rather than going away from the area where unemployment is rampant . They all complain how about the Koreans are making better and cheaper ships while having their drinks and seeing the world passing them by without even the least amount of worry about what tomorrow would bring . On top of that , the film feels false from beginning to end . Javier Bardem , with his rugged face , is the leader of this pack . His Santa is a man with a lot of pain and resentment , yet he prefers to bask in the sun rather than going to work and stop feeling sorry for himself . Luis Tosar is Jose who has his own demons to deal with . He is a coward who feels threatened by a wife who has her feet on the ground . Jose Angel Egido and Nieve de Medina are good in their roles . This movie is a painful reminder of what is wrong with the film industry in Spain , as well as other European countries that had seen better times . Everyone is ready to denounce Hollywood and the American film industry as the culprit for their decline . But just think about planning a Saturday night dinner and going to the movies for a relaxing time , if the selection was " Monday in the Sun " , please prepare the Alka-Seltzer for the indigestion afterward ! We hope director Leon lightens up for his next opus .
555361	1406078	63688	6.0	The windmills of my mind	The original Thomas Crown Affair directed by Norman Jewison was praised in its day as stylish and ahead of its times . On a second view , this is far from the truth . The film is a pretext to show Faye Dunaway in about 30 costume changes and little else of substance . Steve McQueen was a strange bird indeed . As an actor he is always the same . Watch him in this film , or Bullit , or any other of his movies , and you'll see him do the same expressions and pretending to be cool all the time , something that in real life , he was not . Steve McQueen was the product of Hollywood . He was more of a presence than a convincing actor who can make the viewer believe he is seeing that character he is portraying come true . On the other hand , Faye Dunaway went from modeling to acting , and she could act , but not in the way the director instructed her what to do in this film . Faye Dunaway is a beautiful woman who at that point in her career cut quite a figure . Unfortunately , her Vicki Anderson is all phony and mannered . Even the title song is sung badly within the movie . Michel Legrand needed someone else to sing it to do justice to it . Frankly , this film would have died at the box office if it were released today !
555216	1406078	218411	6.0	The coach	Barry , a supervisor in a brick factory in Johanesburg , is a man that wants to train some of his workers for the grueling Comrade marathon . His superior comes to him early in the story to tell him he is replacing him with a younger , more capable black man . Barry , who is of retirement age , doesn't take the news kindly because it will separate him from the four athletes he is training and feels they will not have the discipline he demands of them . One day Barry discovers a young woman running . She is Christine , who shows all the characteristics to make an excellent long distance runner and who will do well at the Comrade . Barry takes her under his wing and even brings her to his suburban home , something that is not looked kindly by the white neighbors who object of the intrusion . Barry's demands and how he deals with the training of Christine makes the young woman leave him . She needs a job and has to find her own way in the world . As the marathon day comes close , Christine and Barry are reunited , but on her terms . Christine goes to win the race as the first South African black woman to do so . Jean Stewart's film doesn't seem to make up its mind where to go . It's not realistic the way he approaches the way he sets his story . One goes along , because it's a predictable feel good movie , where we know before hand how will it end . Armin Mueller Stahl is good as Barry , the man who has tried for the Comrade himself , and failed . Nthati Moshesh is appealing as Christine , a dark beauty who makes a valuable contribution to the film .
555280	1406078	425395	6.0	Meet the parents	Imagine the cruelty of adoptive parents to tell an unsuspecting son that he is adopted ? To make matters worse , the Claytons , a rich couple , have waited a long time to spring the news to Richard , who is about to get married ! This is the premise for this comedy created by Greg Glienna , who also contributed to its screen play . The film , which went directly to video , never had a chance to make it commercially , in spite of the prominent figures in the cast . In fact , the film seems to this viewer as a variation of the more successful " Meet the Parents " , which employed Mr . Glienna as a writer . Not that this film is horrible , by any means , but it appears the powers that be must have had doubts about its impact and sent it to the DVD limbo . Ron Livingston , who is seen as Richard , the man who is told he has been living a lie , is quite good and shows a flair for comedy . Neve Campbell is also effective in playing the object of Richard's love . The combination of the vulgar Meneres as played broadly by Danny Devito and Kathy Bates have some good moments . Christine Baranski and Edward Herrmann play the Claytons , the uptight adoptive parents . The one that is hardly recognizable is Beverly D'Angelo , who must have gone through a procedure to change the way we remembered her .
555857	1406078	116745	6.0	All that jazz	Robert Altman , perhaps one of the most innovative directors , working in Hollywood pays homage to his home town : Kansas City . Mr . Altman recreates a long gone era that he probably didn't know that well , being only a child at the time the action takes place . It seems as though the allure of the period made a vivid mark in the director's mind , as he takes us , with this film , for a long over due visit . Make no mistake , this is not another " Nashville " , quite the contrary . The only similarity is the title that reflects a city name . As written by the director and Frank Barhydt , the film succeeds in creating the atmosphere , but as far as the story line goes , it has the quality to disorient , even the most avid of Mr . Altman's fans . What Kansas City lacks in story line , it makes up with the glorious music that serves as compensation with the thinness of the material one sees on the screen . The music is the best excuse to watch the movie that showcases an excellent group of musicians playing heavenly in between the action . Mr . Altman's choice of Jennifer Jason Leigh as Blondie , is probably what's wrong with the film . This actress mumbles her lines , plays Blondie as strident woman and manages to derail the film . On the other hand , Miranda Richardson's Carolyn Stilton gives her one of the best roles in her career . Ms . Richardson appears to be on a cloud most of the time because of her opium addiction . She makes us care for her portrayal of this society woman that needs all the help she can get . Having it all , she can't cope with being married to a cold man that couldn't care less about her . Where other lonely wives resort to drinking , Mrs . Stilton gets away from it all with drugs . Harry Belafonte plays the local gangster in charge of illegal gambling that evidently was prevalent in the city . His Seldom Seen character is at times inaudible by the way he throws his lines . Sometimes we have to strain our ears in order to hear what he is saying . Mr . Belafonte is a fine actor . As far as Dermot Mulroney and Steve Buscemi are concerned , they have not much to play in the movie to make us care for them . The supporting roles are good . In spite of this movie not being one of Robert Altman's best , it presents a fine opportunity to absorb the atmosphere and the music of the era , oh , and all that jazz !
556504	1406078	377043	6.0	Bostonians and Californians	One has to wonder how did Henry James novel " The Bostonians " inspired Jonathan Parker into re-telling it using themes of ecology , greed and love in the Californian landscape of Marin County . The basic problem with the film is that it throws a lot of ideas around , but eventually none of them come to be realized . The idea that a young woman , Zoe , the daughter of progressive parents that are into the environment and that falls for the greedy developer , Gavin , is something that doesn't pan well . The same goes for Olive , the sister of Gavin who is opposed to all his big plans to create a gated community where multi-million dollar homes are going to built . The only interesting thing in the film is the cast that Mr . Parker attracted . Noah Wyle , Ileana Douglas , Kate Mora , Joanne Whalley , Keith Carradine , Cloris Leachman , and Valerie Perrine , are among the players of this satirical film that doesn't live to its premise .
555199	1406078	257756	6.0	Haven't we seen this before ?	Director Carl Franklin should have stayed away from Joseph Finder's novel that is the basis for the film , or at least , he should have asked for a better adaptation . There is no originality in what we are watching . The characters come out as one dimensional . Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd have collaborated before , to better results . In this film the logic of the screen play needed a strong hand , or at least a reality check . We know from the beginning what's going to happen . There is no real suspense in the story and the way it turns out . James Caviezel , as Tom is the only one that has any opportunity to shine . Better luck next time .
555056	1406078	407342	6.0	On the run	Benoit Jacquot takes a real story from the 70s to base his film . " A tout de suite " photographed in black and white by Caroline Campeter , tries to capitalize on the mood and atmosphere of better made French movies of an earlier period . The young woman , Lili , at the center of the film , is a woman from a bourgeois home . Evidently , although nothing is made clear , her parents are divorced , or at least are separated . The big apartment where she lives with her father and sister seems to be the refuge for stray characters this girl feels attracted to . First , when we first encounter her , she is in bed with another young woman , who is a fellow student in her drawing class . There is a hint of lesbianism , although nothing is clear . Lili and the friend later meet a shady character who invites them to go dancing . In the boite , Lili meets Bada , a Moroccan , who she feels immediately attracted to . This chance meeting will prove to be Lili's downfall as she embarks in a partnership with a couple of bank robbers trying to escape justice in France . The film's best asset is Isild Le Besco , who as Lili makes the best of the central role . Ms . Le Besco is a beautiful woman who one sees in all her splendor . This is an actress who has no problems being naked in front of the camera that clearly adores her . Her character is a complex one . The other players , none of whom we are acquainted with , do their jobs well . Mr . Jacquot film has a feel of being a documentary in the way the action is presented . " A tout de suite " is only notable for the character study of Lili , but we don't feel involvement with the rest of the people we meet . It's a disturbing film that , judging from the empty theater where we saw it , doesn't seem to have caught the imagination of the public .
555049	1406078	424789	7.0	The zone	Zetterstrom , a talented pianist , is seen at an early age playing a composition for his teacher . His career that takes off because of his talent , comes to a crossroad when he meets the beautiful Andrea one night when he is locked out of his apartment . It is obvious he loves her , yet , one notices a certain lack of commitment on his part . Andrea's love for Zetterman will end up in tragic consequences . The pianist goes to New York , where he is well regarded for his brilliant technique , returns to Copenhagen where things have changed dramatically . There is a part of the city that has been cut off from the rest where no one is allowed to enter . Zetterstrom is asked to visit a mysterious man and he is given secret instructions in how to get in " The Zone " . His memory , it appears , has left him . As much as he tries , he doesn't seem to reconnect with his past . Zetterstrom receives an invitation to come to the Zone . Once there , the pianist meets a man in a wheelchair who instructs him to drink from a glass . He is leery , but decides to go along . What happens is that Zetterman's talent for playing the piano is gone forever as we searches in vain to regain it . Snippets of his past are seen in flashes leaving him frustrated because suddenly , he knows what went wrong in his relationship and personal life . " Allegro " , Christoffer Boe follow up after " Reconstruction " is an ambitious movie trying to combine on elements that we have seen in other films . The director goes into a territory that has been explored by other movies of the same subject . " Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind " and " Alphaville " two other movies that come to mind , must have inspired Mr . Boe in his conception of the material . Best of of all is the cinematography of Manuel Alberto Claro that serves the story well . Ulrich Thomsen makes an appealing Zetterstrom and perhaps the best excuse for watching " Allegro " . Gorgeous model turned actress Helena Christensen doesn't have much to do , although her part is not as important . Hennig Moritzen , who appears as Tom , makes an excellent contribution .
555202	1406078	316465	7.0	On the air	Can a mentally challenged black youth be a catalyst to unite people in a South Carolina town ? The answer appears to be that in spite of his handicap , James Kennedy , understood much more than what he was given credit for and went to become a fixture in the sports scene . Also , the film is saying how many of us overlook people with problems that can be helped if only we have the patience Coach Jones showed to the young man because of his own guilt in his heart . " Radio " , directed by Michael Tolllin , is a formula film inspired on a true story . Yet , the movie is not a complete failure because of the inspired performances the director was able to get from his wonderful cast . Coach Jones is instrumental in getting the young man , who is called Radio because his passion for collecting them , involved in sports , a passion he discovers in this retarded man who has had only hard knocks in his young life . Coming from a poor background , Radio , lives with his mother who is protective of him and questions the coach's intentions . Radio is seen by the school kids as a mascot , at first , then , his sunny disposition wins him the acceptance of everyone because he is a good person without an ounce of malice in his body . The film owes a lot to Ed Harris and Cuba Gooding Jr . who make a great pair as the coach and Radio . Mr . Harris , one of the best actors of our times is never boring in anything he graces with his presence . He gets the essence of the principled coach who sees the possibility to make amends for something that bothers him from his past . Cuba Gooding Jr . is also at his best portraying the mentally challenged young man . The supporting cast is excellent . S . Ephata Merkerson , one of the best actresses of her generation , does interesting work as the mother of Radio . Alfre Woodard , another good actress plays the high school principle with style . Debra Winger , only has a few scenes in the film . " Radio " , while being sentimental , will warm anyone's heart because it shows how we tend to see some people are in our society that we know nothing about and how quick we are to judge them . Michael Tollin puts a lot of ideas in the proper perspective for us .
554890	1406078	233322	7.0	Interview with a legend	" Bette Davis : A Basically Benevolent Volcano " was shown recently on TCM . This is basically an interview with Bette Davis more than a documentary . In it , we get to see the star of so many films talking to the camera about her views on her career and her films . Since it is a candid conversation with Ms . Davis , she seems to be directing her opinions to us , the viewers , on the other side of the room in an intimate way . The narration by Ian Holm makes a good deal of sense , enhancing what we one is watching . What this interview could have used was a different format in which , in addition to telling us about herself , more emphasis in her career could have been illustrated with film clips that would have had a more comprehensive and cohesion in examining and illustrating her long association with the cinema . As it plays , one only gets to see some of her most obvious achievements , while other films in which she shone are not even mentioned , or are bypassed without an explanation . We understand the limitations of this format , and the viewer is lucky to catch a fleeting glimpse of the woman who was a down to earth person in the land of make believe . Ms . Davis never lost touch with her Yankee values and no nonsense attitude toward everything she did . In fact , her puritanical background indicates her upbringing and the influence her mother had on her . Bette Davis , the consummate actress and artist , confesses her quest for perfection and how most of her work didn't quite satisfy her . In fact , the only film that comes close to her best work seems to be " Dark Victory " , which she considered to have met her criteria for the perfection she wanted in everything . It's a shame that only Olivia DeHavilland , Anne Baxter , Geraldine Fitzgerald and Joseph L . Mankiewicz offer their opinions about Bette Davis . They knew her well , but one misses hearing from other voices too . The interview is essential for Bette Davis ' fans who can see one of the legends of the cinema recounting her life for our benefit .
555818	1406078	38916	7.0	The Addams family	This was obviously a Claudette Colbert vehicle . " The Secret Heart " is not shown often these days , and it's a good melodrama , typical of the era . Robert Z . Leonard directs with panache this story about a woman's sacrifice and decency . If you haven't seen the film , perhaps you should not read further . We first meet Leola ( Lee ) aboard a luxury liner with Chris Matthews , who is obviously in love with her . Lee has been asked to marry Chris ' best friend Larry , and Lee feels her duty to go ahead with her plans to marry this troubled man , a widower with two small children . What Lee gets from that union is much more than what she bargained for . Larry turns out to be an embezzler at the bank he works for . His guilt will make him commit suicide . Lee decides the right thing to do is to repay Larry's debts and hide from the young children the fact about their father's suicide . Chase , the boy , is a grounded person and he goes on with his life . Young and fragile Penny , who adored her father and the music he played , never recovers and retreats into a cocoon ; she becomes a troubled girl that only finds comfort in playing the piano just to imitate her father . Claudette Colbert does wonders playing the courageous Lee . She caters to the children and becomes a successful real estate agent . Of course , as the stereotypical step-mother of all dramas , she is not appreciated by Penny , the girl that carries a grudge toward Lee . Walter Pigeon is the man who has loved Lee forever , but he is too decent to even come close to her . June Allyson is perfect as Penny , the neurotic girl who will find the truth about her father's fate at the end . In minor roles we see Robert Sterling , Patricia Medina , Richard Derr and Lionel Barrymore . This film is well crafted and acted under Mr . Leonard's ti
555981	1406078	112679	7.0	Friendship	Perhaps not having read Maeve Binchy's book , in which this film is based , and never seeing the film when it was released , helped this viewer to enjoy it , perhaps more than most people that saw it in its commercial debut . Pat O'Connor and his adapter , Andrew Davies , give us a portrait about the friendship of three young girls in the story , as they go from childhood to womanhood in the Ireland of some time ago . We meet the three friends as the film opens . There are Benny , Eve and Nan , who are inseparable . They grow up and their relationship continues right through adulthood . The three friends go to university and we see them attending Professor Flynn's class , which seems to be the girls ' favorite teacher . Nan , the prettiest of the three has no prospects of marrying into money . She decides to go after Simon Westwood , a wrong choice that turns out even worse when she discovers he couldn't care less for her . He just wants to marry money and she doesn't have it . Eva , the orphan girl brought up by nuns , has no prospects either , but she has a cottage in the country that Nan finds convenient for exploring her sexuality with Simon . The best adjusted of the three friends is plain Benny , who seems destined to marry her father's clerk , the reptilian Sean . She has her eyes set on Jack Foley , the hunky jock . Jack in turn likes her , but things intervene between them . Minnie Driver , is a marvelous presence in the film . She makes the plain Benny come alive . Saffron Burrows is perfect as the vain and beautiful Nan . Geraldine O'Rawe plays Eve . Chris O'Donnell is Jack Foley , who makes a good impression . Alan Cumming , Colin Firth and Ciaran Hinds are perfect in their supporting roles . " Circle of Friends " , while not breaking any ground , is still a good movie to watch because Pat O'Connor's direction and the ensemble acting cast .
556400	1406078	386346	7.0	Grace's diner	Not having a clue as to when this film version of William Inge's play " Bus Stop " had been made into another film , we decided to give it a try . As it turned out , it was an actual filmed play as it was seen at the Claremont Theater in California , directed by Peter Hunt . " Bus Stop " was a success on Broadway . It boasted Kim Stanley , one of America's great actresses of the last century in the title role , and the incomparable Elaine Stritch as Grace , the owner of the roadside diner where all the action takes place . The play , directed by Harold Clurman , a pillar of the New York theater , was a smash hit . The film version that followed in 1956 starred Marilyn Monroe . This 1982 filmed version sticks closely to the original Inge play . Cherry is played with great feeling by Margot Kidder , a good actress who knew her character well and projects sincerity and charm in her approach to this woman . Tim Matheson , who should be seen more often , appears as Beau . The solid cast also included veterans of the stage and screen , Claude Akins , Pat Hingle , Joyce Van Patten , and Barry Corbin , among others . Director Peter Hunt gave a quick pace to the production and it shows by the way the audience responds to all the key moments in the play . If it happens to show in your cable network , give it a try , you will not be disappointed .
554557	1406078	307987	7.0	Dear Santa . . .	Terry Swigoff has come out with the perfect take off on the commercial side of Christmas with this tale of a raunchy Santa impersonator who is such a loser , but with his heart in the right place . Billy Bob Thornton's dialogue with the kid , an angelic Brett Kelly , is the stuff to make a parent cringe in absolute horror . We have always seen the figure of Santa as the perfect man , but never in our wildest dreams have we ever imagined anyone could be this way at all . That's why some people seeing this satire will get grossed out , while a lot of Swigoff's fans will be delighted by Willie , a down and out petty criminal who drinks too much , but always speaks his mind . Tony Cox as the elf is also very good , but this is Billy Bob's film from beginning to end . Mr . Thornton's work is always outstanding , as he has proven before , and he will continue to do so by choosing carefully the vehicles for his appearances . Brett Kelly is a little cherub . He is the perfect foil to Billy Bob Thornton , as he is the epitome of what a kid that age should be like .
556637	1406078	125971	7.0	The preppy	Peter Farrelly wrote the novel in which this film is based . This was a change of pace for Peter and his brother Bobby , coming right after their hit " There's Something About Mary " . Although they entrusted the direction to Michael Corrente , their presence looms large in the background . The film succeeds in presenting characters one can identify with . Timothy Dunphy is a teen ager who has grown with his younger , handicapped brother , Jackie , in a small town in Rhode Island . Timothy's future is uncertain , at best . Coming from a working family , his prospects for higher education are nil . Like other young men in his area , he is aimless and the guys he pals around with , are not exactly college material . When Timothy is granted admission at the preppy Cornhill Academy , his life takes a turn for the better . At first , Timothy fights the rigid standards of the place . He doesn't like the atmosphere , but he is completely won by a pretty co-ed , Jane Weston , a rich girl , way out of his league . It's easy to see the combination will see trouble along the way . The best trait about Timothy Dunphy is his honesty that comes into play right after Jane is caught with some boys smoking pot , and her ambition to go to Brown University is doubtful . Timothy does the right thing in going to the admissions dean at Brown to speak on behalf of the innocent Jane , who didn't bring her fate upon herself . Shawn Hatosy , an actor who is always effective no matter what part he is playing , makes the most out of his Timothy . Surprising also , is Alec Baldwin , seen as the older Dunphy in a sincere performance . Jon Abrahams is Drugs Delaney . Amy Smart makes a valuable contribution to the film as Jane Weston . The teaming of Michael Corrente and the Farrelly Brothers show a winning combination in an enjoyable film that will stay in one's memory for quite some time .
555225	1406078	841044	7.0	They'll always have Paris	Julie Delpy , the talented actress of " 2 Days in Paris " surprises with this tale of a pair of lovers at a crucial moment of their relationship . Ms . Delpy , who wrote and directed the film shows how well she has learned the lessons of being in front of the camera . The end result is a delightful film that owes a lot to previous films where she has appeared . Throughout the movie one felt the presence of Richard Linkletter , who directed her in two films that bear some resemblance to this one , and Woody Allen , in the way Ms . Delpy presents the character of Jack , her lover of two years . Jack , a New York neurotic , feels out of his usual turf . In a way , he is totally overwhelmed by the life Marion , his girlfriend , has left behind for a life in America . Julie Delpy plays Marion wearing thick black eyeglasses that hide her beautiful face in a way we are not used to see her in movies . She plays the straight part against the goofy Jack of Adam Goldberg . Mr . Goldberg has some good moments when he is at his nastiest , like with the group of tourists he misdirects in order to get ahead of them in the taxi queue . One hopes Ms . Delpy will come with another film in a not too distant future for she shows a natural ability to set a pleasant story in an enjoyable way .
555367	1406078	489664	7.0	Cat and mouse	Neil Randall , a successful advertising executive , is seen at the beginning of the story talking with a colleague about a project that will be the subject of their impending meeting . Although Neil puts in a good word for his friend , he ends up being tapped to do the job because of his experience . There is something about Neil that doesn't feel right in our mind . Neil seems to be the man that has it all . He owns a beautiful home , is married to Abby , a gorgeous creature , and is the father to a cute little girl , Sophie . Abby , a promising photographer has given her ambition to be a wife and mother . As Neil and Abby prepare to spend a week-end with his boss , where he will probably be told he is a partner in the agency . We see an older woman comes to babysit with the girl . What follows then , is a nightmare Neil didn't prepare for . A demented man is in their car asking a great deal of money as ransom for Sophie's release . Tom , the abductor , seems to know a lot about Neil , being always ahead of the game . Thus begins a night ride through Chicago where Neil and Abby are taken from place to place until Tom's demands are met . Mike Barker , the director , gives a stylish account of this thriller that seems to have been disowned by the people responsible for its wide release and went to DVD and cable immediately . Written for the screen by William Morrissey , this thriller of suspense begins well , but there are too many clues that will help an observant viewer to discover the truth behind this long night's journey to nowhere . Gerald Butler makes a good impression as Neil , the arrogant and ambitious man that thinks he can pull anything and not be punished for his actions . Pierce Brosnan , acting against type , also contributes to the film . His take on Tom , the man that appears to be acting out of greed , hides behind a menacing attitude that paid big time . Maria Bello , on the other hand , has little to do in the film . The film will be gratifying for fans of the two principals . Mr . Barker who has worked extensively on television has a keen eye for detail . Ashley Rowe's cinematography is one of the main assets of this feature . The original music score by Robert Duncan works well . The art direction of Michael Wong contributes to the enjoyment of the film .
555689	1406078	470732	7.0	I love the way you're breaking my heart !	If there is a clue to the relationship between Doris Duke and her live-in assistant , Bernard Lafferty , it seems to be the moment in which she asks him point blank : " What do you want from me ? " After all , Ms . Duke was used to buy people left and right , as it was rumored was the case when she paid a million dollars to French actress Danielle Darrieux for the privilege of divorcing playboy Porfirio Rubirosa . Doris , who evidently got tired of people and things easily , had the upper hand in dealing with what she needed at any particular moment . " Bernard and Doris " , an HBO film , directed by Bob Balaban , and conceived by Hugh Costello , is based on a relationship that is perhaps a fantasy in the mind of its creators . Fact and fiction are mixed freely , although this movie doesn't try to give us reality because after all , Doris Duke's real life story would have probably made a Hollywood epic . Some things that come out in the film show us an heiress who enjoyed sex . That explains her marriage to Rubirosa a notorious man of mystical sexual prowess . Doris is seen bedding a rough man who , while satisfying her , he sought to have fun with her maid as well . When she fired the servant she immediately regrets it because of being fond of the way she worked . Bernard Lafferty , a man that had a huge drinking problem , came to work for Doris during her last years . In the film , Bernard is subservient and meek , when reality indicates he probably ruled Doris life with an iron fist . The figure that emerges is not exactly who one could imagine him to be because of the many accusations after Doris ' death . The real Lafferty and the screen Lafferty are two different persons . The film is worth a look because of the work of the two principals . Susan Sarandon is totally convincing as Doris as is the case with Ralph Fiennes the way his character was conceived for this screen treatment . This is one of Susan Sarandon's best roles in quite some time . Mr . Fiennes is great fun to watch as the gay butler that loved to wear his employer's finery . Maurice Rubinstein's cinematography captures the plush interiors of the Duke's estate . Alex Wurman contributed the music score and the editing of Andy Keir work well with Mr . Balaban overall concept .
554853	1406078	382097	7.0	The con men	Ernesto is a man that makes a living out of duping other solid citizens of their hard earned money . Together with Manco , an older man with a lot of experience , he pulls out capers that allow him to make a decent living , but that is not making him a rich man by any means . Enter Federico , an older man who is more experience in the art of deception . Together with the younger Ernesto they prove a winning combination . That only lasts until Pilar , Federico's former love interest , appears in the picture . This Spanish film directed by Miguel Bardem , is light in tone and pleasant to sit through . Other , better made caper films have been made with much clever plots than this one , but the film is easy to take , and at times , it has a lot of funny situations . This viewer will see Federico Luppi in anything , even reading the telephone directory ! He is an actor's actor . We have had the privilege of having seen him in the Buenos Aires stage doing excellent work before his international film career . As Federico , he does what he does best . It's impossible to imagine anyone better in his role . Ernesto Alterio , the son of Hector Alterio , is a young actor who promises to have a great career . Victoria Abril makes Pilar fun as she gets involved with these con men . Miguel Alexandre , a veteran actor , is also good as Manco .
556216	1406078	35742	7.0	A farm in Connecticut	A young and energetic newlywed bride and her architect husband decide to exchange the Manhattan rat race for the pleasures of farm living in Connecticut . Claudia , who is a bubbly woman , is seen running all over the place as we meet her . She is something else ! In fact , she can make anyone dizzy with her effervescent personality . David , her husband , can only sit back and let Claudia be herself . Claudia , who likes to be in all places , all the time , has a flaw in her character in that she loves to listen to a telephone extension while others are talking ; she also loves to pry on the other phone users in the party line that is shared with other neighbors . This character imperfection will get her in trouble , as well as learning first hand of her mother's fatal illness , something David has tried to shield her from . There are some funny moments we meet a British neighbor who thinks nothing about trying to win Claudia over , which makes David think twice about his wife's flightiness and fidelity . We also witness the visit of a Russian singer who loves the farm and thinks nothing about buying it from David and Claudia . They stand to make a tidy profit from the proceeds . " Claudia " , directed with excellent pace by Edmund Golding , was a play before it was adapted for the screen . One can sense the provenance of the material by the way the movie was staged . We can sense the end of each act as different incidents mark the fall of the curtain indicating the breaks in the action . Nevertheless , this is a fun film to watch . A young Dorothy McGuire is the best thing in the film . She shows such a zest for life and vivacity that she dominates the film completely . Robert Young proves to be an excellent partner playing opposite Ms . McGuire . The supporting cast with marvelous actors like Ina Claire , Reginald Gardiner , and Olga Baclanova , contribute to our enjoyment . " Claudia " , which is rarely seen these days , merit a view from lovers of classic cinema .
554690	1406078	303120	7.0	You're mine alone !	Domestic violence is perhaps more prevalent than one realizes . People caught in this situation often don't have the guts to confront reality and never leave the relationship soon enough to gain their sanity . This film , directed by Javier Balaguer , was shown recently on cable and since it paired Sergi Lopez , perhaps Spain's best movie actor , and Paz Vega , got my attention . The situation presented here is a study on how Joaquin , an up and coming advertising executive meets and falls in love with the lovely Angela . One can see from the beginning this relationship is doomed . Joaquin takes out all his frustrations on Angela and beats her up on many occasions until Angela walks out . The best part of the film is the surprising twist we witness at the end . We realize that justice works in mysterious ways , but it finally arrives and Angela is a winner . Sergi Lopez is excellent as Joaquin . This actor has an intelligence that keeps amazing his fans from one film to next . Paz Vega is a beautiful , but resolute Angela . Elvira Minguez plays the pivotal role of Andrea , Angela's best friend , with conviction .
555553	1406078	78481	7.0	Promises promises	Robert Altman's " A Wedding " was shown recently on cable . Having seen it when it was first released , I was curious as to how it kept after all these years . Being an admirer of Mr . Altman's work , it was worth watching again , although the movie seems a bit too long on second viewing . Mr . Altman brings two families into a formal wedding that are as dissimilar as oil and water . The groom's family is old money and the bride's is new money , perhaps , although the latter one seem to be out of place . The immediate reaction is : why are these two people marrying ? Frankly , it makes no sense , at all . We are treated to a wedding reception from hell ! The wedding party as well as some of the few guests that attend the reception are an odd lot indeed . Logic would indicate that if a wedding is at the center of the story , the bride and the groom should be more prominently focused , but this being an Altman film , they are not as important as the people around them . There is the old matriarch with no sense of time , at all ! Then there is the old bishop that might be in the beginning states of dementia . The old family doctor who likes to touch all females ' breasts . We have a wedding planner who has no sense of style . The mother of the bride is swept off her feet by the uncle of the groom in a hysterical sequence . The sister of the bride also had relations with the groom and his class at the military academy ! We get to spy on most conversations . Mr . Altman makes us silent witnesses to what is going on behind the scenes . This is his device for telling his story ; he lets us hear snippets of conversation to get an idea of what is really going on . " A Wedding " is a minor Altman . Somehow this story doesn't grab the viewer the same way as some of his best pictures , but it's a fun ride all the same . At the end we have learned the secrets of the two families and frankly , most of it was not that interesting . That is why , perhaps , this movie , although it tries , never found a wider audience when it came out in 1978 . This film is for Altman fans , mainly .

Tieta has a mysterious aura about her , that no one , even her father and sister , can't imagine where her wealth comes from . Of course , having been married to a wealthy man might have been one scenario , but there are many hints pointing about what the nature of her " business " is in Sao Paolo . The truth will not be revealed until the end , when Tieta , who has grown restless in the small town , decides to go back where she belongs . The novel by the great Jorge Amado gets a tepid adaptation by director Carlos Diegues . This is his third movie based by the director of Jorge Amado's novels . Diegues was more successful with his earlier films , " Dona Flor e Seus Dois Maridos " and " Gabriela , Cravo e Canela " , using the master story teller's texts . In all these films he has been lucky enough to entice the gorgeous Sonia Braga to participate in them . In fact , " Tieta do Agreste " kept reminding us of Frederich Durrenmatt's " The Visit " because in both a rich woman , who has been wronged in the past , come home to deal with the town and the people that were cruel to them , but that's where all the similarities end . In the German version , Karla deals with her past in a vengeful way , whereas in the Brazil of Jorge Amado , Tieta has a different approach . Sonia Braga's Tieta is full of fire , and for being in her forties , at the time she made the film , she shows quite a figure as the sultry creature who discovers a few things about herself , her family , and the town in which she was banished from by her heartless father . When she needed compassion , Tieta , got none . Her revenge is that she became rich and now she is in a position to help the backward Northeast town to get the electricity it badly needs . In the process , she falls in love with a younger man who betrays her . Tieta deals with her pious sister who only cares for the money she can get for herself and her son . Carlos Diegues got excellent performances from this talented cast . Marilia Pera , who plays Perpetua , Tieta's sister makes an excellent contribution to the film . Claudia Abreu , is another good actress that makes a good appearance in the film as Leonora , Tieta's step-daughter . The rest , Chico Anysis , Zeze Notta , Leon Gomes , among others , make a great contribution . We read recently that Ms . Braga had returned home from her prolonged stay in the U . S . , as she felt Hollywood , in general , had not been too kind to her lately . Ms . Braga deserves vehicles like " Tieta do Agreste " in which to shine . One could only hope her collaborations with Brazilian directors like Carlos Diegues will produce many more happy collaborations for our benefit .
555625	1406078	25301	7.0	Box it !	" Imitation of Life " , the 1934 version , reflected the attitude in the country toward blacks . This movie wouldn't have had a chance of being made in the present climate of political correctness . This movie shows how Hollywood dealt with the racial issues back in those years . John Stahl directed the film , which stands in stark contrast with the Douglas Sirk's take in 1959 which presents a glossier vision of the Fanny Hurst novel , in which it's based . Between the two versions , this one seems to make more sense , in spite of the incredible jump from rags to riches Bea Pullman experiences . Claudette Colbert makes Bea more accessible to us , in contrast with Lana Turner's blonde goddess looks . This Bea Pullman is easier to take because the way she makes her money by going into business , capitalizing on Delilah's idea about the marketing the perfect blend for pancakes . Warren William plays Steve Archer , the man who falls in love with Bea while not suspecting the effect he causes in young Jessie , Bea's daughter . Louise Beavers is Delilah ; she is made to speak broken English to show her ignorance , which was the thing expected every time black characters were shown in movies of that period . Ms . Beavers ' role was made bigger in the 1959 remake , but Juanita Moore , who played the part , was not subjected to her predecessor's fate . Rochelle Hudson , Ned Sparks and Fredi Washington round up the supporting cast .
556490	1406078	280605	7.0	Pizza anyone ?	" Dirty Deeds " takes a nostalgic view of the Sydney of the late nineties as we are taken along to meet a local gangster who is ruthless against his enemies , or the people trying to invade his territory . The action takes place in King Cross , an area where night life was the main attraction . David Caesar and his cinematographer , Geoffrey Hall , created a film that seems to have been shot in that era , as they have given the movie a faded look that works well with the story they are telling . The film has some funny moments that come at unexpected moments . The inside joke seems to be about how to really make a good pizza , something that might not have been done at the time . The film makers have to be congratulated in bringing a brilliant cast together for the movie . Bryan Brown plays the kingpin Barry Ryan with equal amount of meanness and humor . Mr . Brown is an actor that is always consistent in anything he does and he should be seen more often . Toni Collette is one of the best actresses working in films , who is at home in drama as well as comedy , and she has a rare opportunity to show her talent playing Barry's wife , Sharon . John Goodman is good as the American mafioso who is outsmarted by his Aussie counterpart . Sam Worthington is fine as the naive Darcy and Kesty Moressi also does a good job as Margaret . The only one that has nothing to do is Sam Neill . " Dirty Deeds " works well as a drama and a comedy because there are elements of both in it thanks to the way David Caesar presents his material on the screen .
555045	1406078	29539	7.0	Chico , Diane , Heaven !	Chico , a sewer worker in Paris rescues Diane , a prostitute , from the police . He not only offers his protection , but also his unending love . Diane , who up to that point had been abused by many people , suddenly realizes the love she receives from Chico lifts her from a dreary existence and helps her find her own voice . Alas , war intervenes at the time the couple decides to get married . Chico , an avowed atheist , invents his own wedding vows as he and Diane exchange chains to wear around their necks instead of the customary ring . Both make a promise to chant their names and pretend they are in heaven at 11am each day . The ritual keeps them hoping for an eventual happy life together in peaceful times . This 1937 release directed by Henry King , is seldom seen these days . The basic reason for watching it again is the sweet presence of Simone Simon and James Stewart . These two actors contributed to make the film much better than it should have been if played by others . Ms . Simon , one of the most beautiful faces in the French cinema , had a wonderful screen presence that works well opposite to the young and disarming James Stewart , at one of the best points of his budding career . Others in the cast included Jean Hersholt , who appears as the priest that tries to convert Chico . This is the same actor whose name is synonymous with worthwhile causes within the film industry and who died much to young to continue his humanitarian work . Also , Gregory Ratoff , Gale Sondergaard , Sig Ruman and J . Edward Bromberg and the rest do great work in the film . The copy shown on cable was not exactly the best , but as in other memorable films , what matters is the story and the great performances that Henry King got from everyone .
554732	1406078	274407	7.0	Dressed to kill by Chanel	This film arrives two years after it was released in Europe . Frankly one doesn't know who to blame for a movie that leaves the viewer confused about who the real Maria Callas was . Franco Zeffirelli should have known better . He was around when Callas was at the peak of her career . To team up with Martin Sherman in this shameful travesty it's a betrayal to her memory . The thing that comes clearly in the film is Maria Callas ' sense of professionalism and perfectionism she asked of herself and the ones involved in any project she undertook . Alas , what we watch is the sad final days of a woman who threw everything away for the love of Ari Onassis , who didn't deserve . Fanny Ardant , at times looks like Maria , but there is a problem with her distinct French accent because we all know Maria Callas was born in New York and her command of English , was impeccable . Jeremy Irons also appears as the manager . To catch the art of Maria Callas at her best , one must check " Medea " directed by Pier Paolo Pasolini . Callas comes across as the great actress that she was .
555629	1406078	29347	7.0	Let's put a symphony orchestra together !	This delightful family picture reflects how the public taste changes over the years . Movies , in general , were kinder to serious music then , something that no studio would even consider in tackling these days . This was a vehicle for Deanna Durbin , who reigned supreme at Universal and who had movies tailor made for her to showcase her talents . Ms . Durbin was a cute young girl in those years . She was wonderful in the way she projected charm without being obnoxious , or bratty . Her singing voice was amazing and it was always prominently heard in all the movies she made . The story is something typical of those years . Director Harry Koster was able to present the material in a good fashion . The film follows Ms . Durbin in her quest to help her impoverished father and his musician friends . With the help of the rich Frosts , she is able to bring together the talented unemployed music men into forming an orchestra and convincing the great Leopold Stokowski to make music with them . The film will not disappoint Ms . Durbin's fans . Adolph Menjou plays her father . The wonderful Alice Brady and Eugene Palette are seen as the generous Frosts , and Mischa Auer plays the family friend Michael .
555421	1406078	157503	7.0	Looks can kill you	The world of the teen beauty pageants is at center stage in this satire that is set in Mount Rose , Minnesota , a town where Lutherans appear to be a majority . The 50th anniversary of Miss Teen Princess America attracts a lot of the young women in town . The message in the film appears to be that being beautiful can kill you , sometimes . Gladys Leeman , a former winner , is one of the organizers . Her own daughter , Becky , is competing . She is a prominent citizen of Mount Rose , with her own agenda . The competing girls come from different social backgrounds . One of the most talented ones is Amber , a girl that lives in a trailer park with her alcoholic mother . Mysterious things begin happening to different participants in the contest , the most serious one occurs to Annette Atkins , Amber's mother , whose trailer catches fire and her hand gets attached to the beer can she was drinking . Amber , who is clearly the most talented girl in the contest , loses to Becky , something one knew was coming from the start of the competition . There are funny moments in this film , which was directed by Michael Patrick Jann , and written by Lona Williams who seems to know a great deal about these beauty contests . Somehow , the film must have seem funnier to its creators . There are good moments like Becky's selection for the talent portion of the show . Also , the way most of the girls competing in the state portion of the competition get sick after eating sea food . Kirsten Dunst makes an appealing Amber , the nice girl from the wrong side of town . Kirstie Alley is the force behind the contest and the woman who dominates everything in Mount Rose . Ellen Barkin has some good moments as Annette , but what happens to her is not as funny as it must have looked to the creators of the film . Allison Janney is seen as Loretta , Annette's trailer park neighbor . Denise Richards adds her beauty to the film . Amy Adams , an uncommon talented actress , has a small part as Leslie , a girl that loves boys and ends up having quite a career !
555274	1406078	479140	7.0	Hit and run	As the movie starts , we watch a man on a lonely road at night , walking . We hear an impact and naturally , we think the man has been hit by a car we don't see . After the titles , we are taken to a shoot for a clothing sports line using the label Trash . The main force behind the clothes is being photographed with a hot model . This man , Amir Atrash , seems to be on his way up in the fashion industry . Well , things don't go too well for Atrash , who has to cut expenses when the investment bankers that are behind a deal to take the label to the stratosphere , have cheated on the contract that would make the designer a millionaire . He walks out the deal . Atrash , who has a lovely wife , is not a happy man . This explains why we see him at a party where a paraplegic man is among the guests . Atrash follows him , and his wife because he has a thing to tell Philip , the man on the wheel chair : he was the one that struck him and is responsible for his present condition . This film written , directed and acted by Philip Caland , was a surprise when we stumbled into it recently . " Ripple Effect " is an engrossing film of redemption as the guilty man has carried a burden within him for a lot of years and now , when we meet him , he wants to ask forgiveness as he tells his victim what happened that fateful night . Some of the great cast that was assembled are also producers of this picture and it helps explain how comfortable they feel playing their roles . Forest Whitaker is the paraplegic man . Philip Caland plays Atrash with conviction . Also seen the gorgeous Virginia Madsen , Minnie Driver , Kali Rocha , John Billingsley , among others . The haunting music is by Anthony Martinelli . The fantastic editing was done by two men who know a thing or two about movies , Yvan Gauthier and Joseph Semanse . The camera work by Daron Keet also enhances the film . While no doubt this film will be liked , or dismissed , it's worth a view by discerning viewers .
556274	1406078	331525	7.0	Hunting for ivory in the Malaysian jungle	Sarah Morris , who is the intended bride of Hamish Winslow , decides to accompany him to the Malaysian outpost in the jungle before they tie the knot . Sarah , finds out , in the worst way , the horrors of being in that isolated spot , where she awakens a passion on a lonely man whose sexual appetite she awakens . The post is run with an iron hand by an English woman , Mrs . Jones , who has a creepy son , William . He begins spying on Sarah through cracks in the hut where she and Hamish are staying . This lonely man sees the attractive Sarah as a sex object that he craves . William goes berserk when he finds out his own mother has someone else in mind to succeed her in running the business . As another contributor has remarked , this film , although different , seems to recall another one , " At Play in the Fields of the Lord " because its exotic setting and oppressive atmosphere . Sarah and Hamish feel they are not welcomed in this tight knit group from the start . The film ends with a surprising turn of events . Having seen Janet McTeer act in the theater , both here and in London , and having admired her work , we decided to take a look at " The Intended " , which was co-written by Ms . McTeer and director Kristian Levring . Ms . McTeer's Sarah goes through a great transformation in the remote outpost and the dynamics that bonded her and Hamish Winslow are put to a test . The rest of the cast does a good job to convey the isolation and frustration they experience in that remote area where they encounter themselves . Brenda Fricker , Tony Maudsley , J J Field , Philip Jackson and an almost unrecognizable Olympia Dukakis , do justice to the story . The film is slow as molasses . Perhaps some cutting would have helped to make the film achieve better results because it certainly had the potential and a great actress , Janet McTeer to hold the viewer's undivided attention .
554885	1406078	222850	7.0	The boys in the Santa Monica softball team	We watched this film when it first was released . On second viewing , thanks to the IFC channel , " The Broken Hearts Club " looks a bit dated since more daring films and television series have come out of the closet recently . It must have been a courageous undertaking by its director , Greg Berlanti , in 2000 , at a time that gays were not as prominent as now . The director shows a positive side of the gay life that is not seen often , in that all the characters have values and integrity , something not often seen in mainstream films . The film is an excuse to bring together a group of young men trying to cope with their lives in that environment . There are different stories that mesh well together . At the center of it all is Dennis , a photographer that seems to have his feet well planted on the ground and knows what he wants . The friends are united by Jack , the restaurant owner , who has taken most of the guys under his wing , at his bistro and as a coach them in the softball team . We watch the different situations and how the guys react to whatever comes their way . The acting is good , in general . Timothy Olyphant makes an impression as the serious Dennis . Zach Braff , a film director , himself is good as Benji . Dean Cain is the fickle Cole , who loves a variety of lovers , rather than quality mates . John Mahoney appears as Jack , the older influence on the group in an impressive performance . What director Greg Berlanti succeeded was in presenting young men that appear not to be clichés as in other films of this type . The film is pleasant without breaking new ground .
554829	1406078	323741	7.0	Detour to hell	" Purgatory Flats " , shown on cable recently , is a small movie that packs a lot . Harris Done directs with style . The screen play by Mr . Done and Diane Fine makes a good thriller . If you haven't seen the film , perhaps you would like to stop reading . The film is the story about a young L . A . doctor that made a mistake and lives to pay for it . Upon being released from prison he wants to hide in a small town where he feels he will be forgotten . Bad choice ! What Thomas Reed finds in Purgatory Flats is hell in the desert . Right after landing a job as a bar tender , Thomas meets a pretty young woman , Sunny , who , clearly is someone to stay away from . The young doctor is called to help as Sunny's boyfriend Randy , is gunned down by a drug dealer . We get to know Randy's family . His uncle Dean appears to be OK , but his brother Owen is a loose cannon . Every one in the household is connected in more ways than one to the nubile Sunny . The performances are fine . Vincent Ventresca is Thomas , the man who should have gone to his L . A . practice instead of making a detour to the small town . Alexandra Holden is Sunny , a young woman with a tremendous ambition to escape her surroundings . Kevin Alejandro , Gregg Henry , Brian Austin play the men in the Mecklin family well . Nicholas Turturro makes also a good contribution as the drug dealer . The film shows a director with promise who will go far judging from this tightly constructed film .
556102	1406078	335345	7.0	Speaking in tongues	Isn't it remarkable that the Hollywood establishment passed the opportunity to invest in one of the biggest blockbusters of the year ? For all its critics , Mel Gibson has come up with a winner . It was almost a case of " if Mel makes this film , the masses will come " , and they are responding in record numbers wherever this movie plays . As far as the film itself , it could have gone a bit easier on the violence , but otherwise it doesn't break any new ground as far as cinematic art is concerned . The lesson for the critics of Mr . Gibson's picture is : Never under estimate the power of making a film spoken in Aramaic and Latin with English subtitles !
554773	1406078	323633	7.0	Dinner with friends	Michael Blieden wrote the play in which the film is based . " Melvin Goes to Dinner " is a fast paced adaptation directed by Bob Odenkirk . It was a refreshing movie in which the writer , Mr . Blieden , has opened up the play in a satisfying way . The premise of the film is a dinner among friends . During the dinner we get to know the dynamics among the diners . These yuppies are not the shallow individuals we might have taken them for . During the course of the dinner while the tongues get loose with the drinking , we realize what's really going on . The conversation is easy , and friendly , which is what happens when people that haven't seen one another for some period of time , will pick up where they left off the last time they met . The young cast is likable . The author , Michael Blieden plays the leading role of Melvin . Matt Rice is Joey . Annabelle Gurwitch is Sarah , the woman who is connected to one of the friends in a way the others have no idea . The revelation makes sense . Stephanie Courtney , as Alex , is good . Jack Black appears in a cameo . Bring another bottle of Pinot Noir , please !
556614	1406078	188128	7.0	The baker's daughter	The life of Annie Mary changes completely after the death of her mother . Annie Mary , who had a beautiful voice , suddenly stopped trying to sing opera . Her life in the small Welsh town is boring , to say the least . To make matters worse , her best friend , Bethan Bevan , is struck by cancer . Annie Mary , who is a loyal friend , wants to help her sick friend go to Disneyland . Annie Mary's father , Jack , has a bakery in the town . We see him as he makes his deliveries in a Luciano Pavarotti's mask and singing in his beautiful tenor opera arias that are much admired by the people of the area . When he suffers a stroke , Annie Mary's life goes into a tail spin . As a caretaker , Annie Mary is useless . As much as she tries to make a go at being a baker , she never makes it work . In desperation she turns to Mrs . Madoc , her father's girlfriend , to buy her out . As a way to help Bethan , Annie Mary and a few of the town's women , she decides to enter a contest in Cardiff . They have prepared to do a number of the Village People , " Y . M . C . A . " , but they are horrified when they arrive at the hall where the competition is going to be held , and watch a group of men doing exactly their number , much better . The women decide to change their act into a sort of " Three Tenors " aria in which Annie Mary , wearing an inflated rubber suit , floats into the audience . Needless to say , they win , but emboldened by the turn of events in her life , she gambles all the money into a horse race and loses it . Annie Mary becomes Ogw's most hated person . What's more the trip to Disneyland is too late for Bethan , who suffers a relapse . It's at this point that Annie Mary finds her voice again and she gives her friend a rendition of Puccini's aria " O mio bambino caro " in a shaky voice that gets better as the scene changes to another location . Sara Sugarman , the writer and director of this screwball comedy was lucky in casting one of the most talented actresses working in films these days : Rachel Griffiths . Ms . Sugarman gets a tremendous performance out of Ms . Griffiths , who shows her range in a role she was born to play . Jonathan Pryce is also excellent as the distant father who can't see eye to eye with his daughter . Although sometimes the accents get a bit hard to follow , the luminous presence of Ms . Griffiths and the sure direction of Ms . Sugarman make us overlook that minor problem and enjoy the comedy .
555788	1406078	455805	7.0	An unmarried woman	Consider poor April Epner , she gets married late in life to Ben , a man that will prove emotionally unstable . April's desire to be a mother consumes her . She realizes her chance for conceiving is almost nil after Ben leaves her ; this man is a mamma's boy , if ever there was one . What is April to do ? As if it weren't enough , April receives a blow when her adoptive mother dies suddenly . She learns the hard way about who her real mother is : an egotistical television hostess . At the same time , April , who is a school teacher , begins seeing a single father , Frank , who seems to be the perfect man for her . Is it too much for April to hope for some happiness in her own life ? Watching the last frames of the film one realizes that all what she wanted does indeed comes true . Helen Hunt , the director and co-adapter of the novel by Elinor Lipman , does good work with her first assignment behind the camera . After all , Ms . Hunt has been behind the action for a great part of her life . She proves she has a voice to be considered , even if this effort doesn't satisfy as a whole . Ms . Hunt , who appears as Helen , had the tough task of being in two places , something than even more experienced people have not been able to pull . Her April shows a resolute individual who was born to be a mother , yet nature had a way for denying her wish . Matthew Broderick , who is seen as Ben , the boyish man , makes an impression for bringing that character to life . Colin Firth , a distinguished presence in any film , plays Frank , the man who cares for April . Even Bette Midler , who is April's biological mother , shows restraint in a role that would have been wrong played by someone else . This film debut shows Helen Hunt in a dual capacity . Ms . Hunt deserves another chance and one could only hope for a good source for the material of her next project .
555047	1406078	36599	7.0	Deafness	" And Now Tomorrow " a Paramount release of 1944 showed on cable recently . Directed by Irving Pichel , a veteran Hollywood man , with a great cast that made the film more enjoyable than it should have been . Raymond Chandler , an unlikely candidate to adapt the original novel , was on hand to co-write an intelligent screenplay . This was a vehicle for Alan Ladd , who was one of the most popular stars of that era . Loretta Young had second billing , but gives a stellar performance as Emily Blair , a rich woman who finds out she is deaf . To her rescue comes Dr . Merek Vance , a man of humble origins who grew up poor in Blairtown , the city that is dominated by the rich Blair family . The treatment Dr . Vance wants for Emily is not exactly proved to cure her illness and runs the risk of doing more harm than good .

Jeff is too decent to turn away from Emily , even though his heart belongs to another . Emily who finally realizes she doesn't want to be married to Jeff , and a possible disaster is averted . After all , Emily gets to know that her doctor has more than her cure in mind , since he also has fallen for the good and kind Emily . Loretta Young did wonders with her Emily . Alan Ladd was also effective with his portrayal of Dr . Vance . The supporting cast includes Susan Hayward , Barry Sullivan , Beulah Bondi , Cecil Kellaway and Grant Mitchel . Although a bit dated , " And Now Tomorrow " will certainly not disappoint to fans of this genre .
554967	1406078	38975	8.0	Mute , but not dumb !	This film based on a novel by Ethel Lisa White , gave the director , Robert Siomak the opportunity to bring together a brilliant cast . The suspense created in the movie speaks highly of the skills of this director . He had an eye for creating mystery in ways some other directors couldn't . At the center of the story is Helen , a maid in the Warren household . We watch her at the picture show in town when the film starts . There is a serial killer loose in the area . He only pries on single girls who have physical defects . We know that Helen is not immune to the threat this person represents since she can't talk , thus making her an easy prey for this animal . The cast is excellent . Dorothy McGuire is Helen , the innocent young woman at the center of the story . George Brent always plays convincingly . Ethel Barrymore only has a few good moments , but she makes the best of them . Kent Smith is the young doctor in town in love with Helen . Gordon Oliver is the playboy brother . Elsa Lanchester plays the tipsy cook with gusto . The thriller is spooky enough to keep us guessing who is the killer and why is he doing these horrible murders .
555513	1406078	424908	8.0	The sound of music	Imagine a great composer in his last days . Besides being an impossible genius , he is deaf ! There couldn't be anything worse for a man in Ludwig Van Beethoven's shoes . The music he gave to the world , could only be heard in his head , which was a punishment he certainly didn't bargain for . Anieszka Holland's " Copying Beethoven " is a dark film that tries to imitate the state of mind of the great composer during the last period of his life . The screen play , by Stephen Riveli and Christopher Wilkinson present an unique situation as the maestro's music publisher tries the daunting task to help the man as his 9th Symphony is to have its world premiere in Viena in 1824 . Enter Anna Holtz , a woman who studies music and has even tried her hand at composing . Her first meeting with " The Beast " , as Herr Schlemmer , the publisher , calls him , is a disaster . Beethoven has no other choice but to engage her , insisting she works out of his filthy quarters that has rats scurrying all over the place . Supposedly , Beethoven had two men that helped him with the transcriptions and other matters , but that wouldn't be cinematic . The whole thing was changed in order to allow a beautiful woman be the one that serves as the maestro's ears when it came to helping him conduct his last symphony to great critical acclaim . Ed Harris , an American actor , might have appeared to be the wrong choice for playing Beethoven , but he gives a good performance as the deaf man who sees beauty in his own music , but who can't even hear what it sounds like . Diane Kruger , who is a gorgeous woman , contrasts with the sloppy musical genius from the start . Ms . Kruger manages to get our attention to this woman who endured a lot in trying to help the man she admired . The film is dark . The film was shot in Hungary , which passes for Beethoven's Vienna . Ashley Rowe photographs the stark places where most of the action takes place to give it a realistic look . The 9th Symphony one hears in the background is by Bernard Haitink and the Concertgebow Orchestra , and it shows . Had one heard the small ensemble and chorus one sees in the film , the glorious music wouldn't have sound as robust as it does in the picture .
555617	1406078	47885	8.0	Rock around the clock	" Blackboard Jungle " marked a turn around in films coming from Hollywood . This was a film that dealt with a reality that movies had not dared to touch before in the way they always wanted to sugar coat every picture about teens in high school . The guys one sees here are the real thing , as though taken from any high school in the inner city of that time . The amazing thing this high school , at the center of the action , is not typical of any other schools in that one males attended and no females are to be seen around them . By making an old male high school , Richard Brooks updated Evan Hunter's novel to show the violent nature of most of those young men that are clearly from under privileged homes , perhaps , boys whose fathers had bolted and left their women to bring up the sons they didn't want to have anything with . The film is important in that it marked the arrival of a strong actor that would dominate the movies like no other one , Sidney Poitier . With his handsome looks , and his great screen presence , Mr . Poitier was instrumental in breaking into the main stream movies in ways others tried , but didn't make a dent . Perhaps it was in the cards that Hollywood began dealing with a reality they tried to ignore integrating their stories with Blacks that had taken a back seat to other , not so talented performers . The film works because of the strong performances by Glenn Ford , Vic Morrow and Sidney Poitier . Also , the theme song of the film , " Rock Around the Clock " went to become an anthem for viewers that filled the theaters for the thrill of hearing it play as the film started , putting them in the right frame of mind to accept what they were going to see . Richard Brooks is the one responsible for the adaptation and the inspired direction for the movie that still resonates because of its raw energy .
554826	1406078	34890	8.0	Driving under the influence	" In This Our Life " dared to point out some issues not discussed by the Hollywood of the 40s . It shows a great director , John Huston , working at the top of his craft on the interesting adaptation by Howard Koch . Stanley , the girl at the center of the story has it all . She is the favorite niece of the man who was responsible for ruining her father , a gentle soul beaten by the Great Depression . Stanley is a spoiled woman who couldn't care less who she hurt , let alone that is her own sister the one that will suffer because of her actions . On the other hand , Roy , the good sister , is all kindness ; she is just the opposite of Stanley . When Stanley decides she wants Peter , Roy's husband , she doesn't hesitate one second . She takes him and runs away to a life that proves not to be all what she imagined it would be . Life intervenes in Stanley's life in tragic ways . First with Peter , the man he shouldn't have taken away from her sister , and then when trying to get back with Craig , she causes the death of a young girl when driving under the influence . This would have been a sobering experience for anyone , but Stanley is beyond repentance . Stanley , is a coward who will do anything to get away with murder . Stanley was a role tailor made for Bette Davis . Her take on this impudent girl is perfect . Ms . Davis shows how good she is in small details that convey her understanding of her character . Ms . Davis reflects all the emotions Stanley is going through with her expressive eyes . One look at her and we know what this woman is capable of . Olivia de Havilland makes an impression by playing the good sister , Roy . Ms . de Havilland is an actress that always played convincingly in everything she did , as is the case here . Her inner strength is her best asset . Roy is loyal to the point of sacrificing her own happiness and lets her sister take what she loves most . The strong cast behind the principals is equally excellent . Dennis Morgan is Peter , the man blinded by Stanley . He will leave his adoring wife for a woman he ends up detesting . George Brent , is the kind Craig , the man jilted by Stanley who finally finds love again with Roy . Charles Coburn plays Uncle William with his usual panache . Frank Craven is Asa , the man cheated out of his fortune . Ernest Anderson makes an impression as Parry , the young black man with ambitions to improve himself . Hattie McDaniel only has a couple of key scenes where she shines . Billie Burke and Lee Patrick are seen in minor roles . The musical score by Alfred Newman enhances the film . Ultimately it's John Huston who shows a clear understanding for the material and who gets excellent performances out of everyone .
555448	1406078	126774	8.0	The jock from hell	Never having seen " The Advocate's Devil " , we decided to take a chance and frankly , it paid off quite well . Thanks to director Jeff Fleckner , the film has a lot going . In fact , the crisp cinematography used in it and the excellent editing makes this a movie well worth a look . The film is based on Alan Dershowitz's novel , a defense attorney , himself . We are presented with a situation of how a lawyer's bad judgment clouds his vision and gets a client absolved of a crime that seems , in retrospect , too obvious to even get involved in . Abe Ringel ( Ken Olin ) is retained by jock star Joe Campbell ( Holt McCallany ) when a young woman accuses him of raping her . In fact , Ringel and his team of investigators seem to have doubts about this client from the start . Joe Campbell figures he is above the law and can do whatever he thinks he can get away with , even after a tragedy occurs , for which he is not even blamed . It's not until he decides to concentrate on Emma , Ringel's daughter , when everything comes to a head . The film is interesting to watch because it's not the typical Movie of the Week type . The acting is good and the cast gives an excellent account under the direction of Mr . Bleckner . " The Advocate's Devil " will not disappoint because the quick pace and credible story .
555012	1406078	65724	8.0	The pianist	" Five Easy Pieces " was one of the most revered films of the 1970s . It was the film that showed audiences what Jack Nicholson could do , after having worked for many years in movies that were seen only by real cinephiles , but not by a wider audiences . Not having seen the film in a long time , we decided to watch it when it showed on cable recently . The only thing is the copy we saw was not anamorphic in format , which on key scenes almost shows a blank screen while the characters talk off camera ! Bob Rafelson and Carole Eastman created a screen play that dealt with existential themes , a rarity in the American cinema . Mr . Rafelson was at the height of his creative period , something that later projects seem to contradict the promise he showed at the time . Bobby Dupea , the main character of the story , is a complex individual who has left a life of privilege and culture behind to become an oil rig worker and getting away from his previous life . At the time we meet him , he is involved with Rayette , a simple woman who loves him , but one can see how different they are . That contrast comes more obvious when Bobby goes back home and meets Catherine , his brother's fiancée , who is a musician and seem to be more attuned with Bobby than the simple minded Rayette . " Five Easy Pieces " was a film that showcased the enormously talented Jack Nicholson doing some interesting work . The measure of his acting ability is seen about half way in the movie as Bobby , Rayette , and the two lesbian hitchhikers have stopped at a diner . Bobby's meal order request creates a match of words in which Mr . Nicholson shows what he is capable of doing . The film concludes with a puzzling scene , as Bobby and Rayette are heading back home . We watch them stopping at a gas station and little prepares us for what happens next . In a way , we have seen all along the film how restless Bobby has become and it's clear that in spite of his being with Rayette , she will never understands how to make him happy at all . The reason for watching " Five Easy Pieces " is Jack Nicholson . His character is the most interesting one in the film and he does an excellent job in creating the tension behind this complex man he portraits . Karen Black's Rayette is annoying at times because of her whining . Susan Anspach comes out better playing Catherine . Some other familiar faces in the cast are , Sally Struthers , Ralph White , Lois Smith , Billy Green Bush and Fannie Flagg . " Five Easy Pieces " is one of the best films of that decade .
555214	1406078	401244	8.0	Jilted !	Elliot , the CPA who is seen at the beginning of the picture , is a nerd . Don't get me wrong , he is a good nerd , and that's his own downfall . We watch him as Carloline Swann , his fiancée , enters the church to stand next to him . Right there we realize these two are not made for one another . But have no fear , help is on the way . When the female minister asks the congregation if there is anyone who knows why this marriage can't proceed , a disheveled Bradley , who loves Caroline , comes forward to claim her for his own , leaving Elliot at the altar alone . The action then goes back in flashbacks as to how Elliot and Caroline met . Elliot has employed a temp , Cecil Mills , who is new to Manhattan and is late for work because she got lost . Cecil and Elliot seem to strike a much balanced match , but the beauty of Caroline , when she enters the office erases all traces of the mousy Cecil from Elliot's mind , as he doesn't finish asking her for a concert that night . As the preparations for the wedding get on the way , we realize Elliot and Caroline are not suited for one another . There is a hilarious gay wedding planner called Benson Hedges who will be in charge of the nuptials . Elliot in the end will be " the Baxter " of the title , because he is the man who will end up without getting the luscious Caroline . This wonderful comedy written and directed by Michael Showalter , came and went without much fanfare . It deserved much better , but it might have been the timing for its release that killed all the possibilities , as it came out right after " The 40 Year Old Virgin " had captured the movie going public's affections . This film , in comparison , is like a string quartet . Its heart is in the right place and Mr . Showalter got excellent acting from his ensemble cast . The director , like Woody Allen , just to mention another writer-creator , could have done better by staying behind the camera and casting his Elliot with another actor . Not that he doesn't do a good job , but perhaps he would have made Elliot a more lovable character than what comes in the screen . Michelle Williams steals the film . This actress is amazing . She may not have the meatiest role , but she is someone who the viewer will remember in spite of the beautiful , and talented Elizabeth Banks , who plays the two-timing Caroline . Justin Theroux is Bradley , the boyfriend who couldn't stay away . Zak Orth , Paul Rudd , Havilland Morris , and especially Peter Dinklage , are all wonderful in supporting roles . " The Baxter " is a delightful film thanks to the talented Michael Showalter who will no doubt will go far in whatever he decides to do next .
556117	1406078	47472	8.0	Shall we dance ?	This film owes a great debt of gratitude to Michael Kidd , the great choreographer . Mr . Kidd's talents are clearly visible in the fantastic dancing he created for the movie . The association between Michael Kidd and director Stanley Donen paid off handsomely in the way this movie remains a big favorite . The story of 1850's Oregon , based in a story by Stephen Vincent Benet , is a bit dated , but one must make concessions because the times when this film was made . The music by Gene de Paul and lyrics by Johnny Mercer , although tuneful , won't stay with the viewer for a long time . This is not a musical that distinguishes itself for its songs , but for the fabulous dancing . The cast of this picture is brilliant . Howard Keel and Jane Powell made an interesting couple . All the brothers went to have careers of their own . It's a treat to see Jeff Richards , Tommy Rall , Marc Platt , Matt Mattox and the young Russ Tamblyn do the best dancing to be seen in any musical . Also , Jacques D'Amboise became a famous choreographer himself , surely inspired by what he saw Michael Kidd accomplish with this movie . Also in the cast were a few actresses that later made into the movies , notably , Julie Newmar and Ruta Lee . It was a simple time and " Seven Brides for Seven Brothers " will make anyone happy by watching it .
555782	1406078	276501	8.0	Surviving in the big city	" Beijing Bicycle " the interesting Chinese film directed by Xiaoshuai Wang , has been compared with Vittorio DeSica's masterpiece of the Italian cinema , " Bicycle Thief " . In fact , we suspect this director is telling a story that seems to mirror the other film , but it's Chinese to the core . Young Guo , who has arrived in Beijing from a rural area , is hired as a messenger for an agency that delivers important packages and mail throughout the city . Part of the deal is a shiny new bicycle that will be paid by the new hires after being in the job for a while . The bicycle for Guo means the improvement of his lot in life , as well as freedom to go everywhere and be his own master . Jian , on the other hand , is a student that is seen hanging out with a rough bunch of school mates . Jian is excelling academically , but in order to fit , he must have a bicycle . The film doesn't make clear if Jian himself steals the bicycle , or as he claims , he bought it at the second hand market , with the money he stole from his father , which seems to be the case . He views the bicycle as a sign of status and of belonging ; a means to have been accepted by his peers . Young Guo shows a stubbornness that seems to be a trait with people from the area where he comes from . Instead of accepting the fact that his bicycle has been stolen , he decides to investigate on his own , something that must be a super human task given the millions of bicycles one sees in that city , and a mode of transport for the masses . One can't follow Guo's logic in not going to the police , or when he realizes who has stolen his bicycle , he never challenges the thief . In fact , Jian and his friends show a cruelty for the newly arrived country bumpkin that is scary . In fact , Jian shows a stubbornness himself that is unusual for a city boy that should have known better and who should have realized the plight of Guo . " Beijing Bicycle " shows a side of city living in a city that is crowded and can be cruel to anyone trying to make a life in a decent way . We watch at the end a defeated Guo walking with his mangled bicycle on his way back home , perhaps . The film will not disappoint , in spite of some repetitious sequences thanks to the strength of the two principals and the direction by Xiaoshuai Wang .
555580	1406078	303267	8.0	Runaway train	This nostalgic look at how unscrupulous people can do away with things and institutions long venerated by many , is at the heart of this film , which I saw in DVD format , since it has never had a commercial run in this country , to the best of my knowledge . Director Diego Arsuaga has done wonders with this story about a bunch of older men , who are friends and all they have in common is their love for the steam trains of their youth . When they learn about the last locomotive being sold by the callous Jimmy to Hollywood , they rally against seeing their beloved , if a bit dilapidated locomotive , to be taken away from the country . They consider it to be a national treasure ! How dare he ? This was an inspired cast that teams such accomplished performers such as Federico Luppi , Hector Alterio , Pepe Soriano and other great Argentine actors . Having seem them act in the theatre as well as in films , it was a real treat to see them interact so well together . A feat no train lover should ever miss !
554760	1406078	43012	8.0	Forget your troubles , come on get happy !	" Summer Stock " is not up to par with other MGM musicals , yet , this take on a group of thespians invading a farm to do summer theater will delight anyone looking for a movie that doesn't demand much from its viewers , yet it delivers some unexpected pleasures . As directed by Charles Walters , " Summer Stock " is a rarity , in that it still has a fresh look about how summer theater started . The music , especially Harold Arlen's songs , are tuneful and stay with the viewer . This was another pairing of Judy Garland and Gene Kelly , two of the most admired musical performers at the golden era of MGM . Both performers do well together as they project an ease and charm that filters down to the rest of the movie . Judy Garland is perfect as the girl trying to make ends meet working at the family farm . Gene Kelly is the city slicker who comes unannounced to take over everything to try out his musical play . There are some familiar faces in supporting roles . Eddie Bracken , Phil Silvers , Marjorie Main , Ray Collins , Hans Conreid , and the beautiful Gloria DeHaven . By the magic of the movies we are shown how the rustic barn is transformed into a place that no one would have been able to predict could be made into a stage where the musical takes place . Stay tuned and get happy with this summer film that is as refreshing as an ice cream cone on a hot day .
556028	1406078	166287	8.0	Duality in a macho society	The film has been shown in some festivals , but we don't think it had a commercial run in this country . We caught with it recently on DVD format . The movie , directed by Francisco Lombardi , is based on the novel by television personality and writer , Jaime Bayly , with an adaptation by Giovanna Pollarolo . The film is a frank account on the Peruvian society . It's clear from the start that Joaquin is gay . He has been sheltered by his mother , against his father's wishes . As a way to initiate the young boy in a the typical Peruvian man's world , Luis Felipe , the father , decides to take him hunting , with no good results . Then , the father takes the young man to one of Lima's best house of ill repute , an experience that ends badly . Joaquin likes Alejandra , the young college student . She feels the attraction as well , but Joaquin has an eye for attractive guys . When Gonzalo and Rocio appear at a disco , Joaquin feels attracted to the hunky young man . It's clear Gonzalo is also interested in Joaquin and thus begins their sexual involvement that will not produce the results either one expected . Gonzalo wants to keep seeing Joaquin , but wants to marry Rocio , but Joaquin , in a fit of anger confesses to the young woman her fiancé is having an affair with him and they Gonzalo leaves him . The movie is a complex character study about the duality most of these rich young men of the upper crust of the Peruvian society and how they feel about casual gay sex . In a society dominated by the machismo , they must hide away in a married life that is a cover up for the way homosexuality is concealed . The film is honest in the way it deals with this subject . Santiago Magill makes Joaquin credible in his appealing performance . Lucia Jimenez is also good as Alejandra , the girl that loved him . Christian Meier plays the closeted Gonzalo . Giovanni Ciccia's take on the troubled rich boy Alfonso is right . The rest of the cast does an excellent job in portraying all the upper class people in the movie . Francisco Lombardi directed with panache this story about a taboo in that type of society .
555764	1406078	55310	8.0	The age of innocence .	The atmosphere of this film took me back to another time and place , to a very naive and innocent Spain . This film is Garcia Berlanga's incursion into his own brand of neorealism . The music keeps evoking the scores of the great Italian masterpieces of that period . Placido , the hero , in a way , is everyman caught in a web of bureaucracy where he has to fight against all the odds to keep his vehicle in order to survive . He does whatever he can in order to pay the draft , but all conspires against him . Placido is a decent working person , a man of honor who has to fulfill his obligations , in this case , paying the draft that is due on the day the story unfolds . Everything is against him . We see him fighting his way to do so , in this , his long journey into the Christmas Eve celebration . Cassen was a marvelous and charismatic actor who was very convincing as Placido . He's always at the center of the action , and at times , he is even at the center of some of the other characters conflicts . Jose Luis Lopez Vazquez , is very effective as Gabino , the photographer . The rest of the ensemble cast perform very well under the direction of Garcia Berlanga . The film is a lot of fun .

Tom feels his revenge on the picture framer is past history and since Jonathan is married and has a small boy , he steps into action . Tom Ripley , is one of the most sophisticated bad guys ever created by the excellent Patricia Highsmith . This cool man is capable of doing some of the most daring things . Liliana Cavani , an Italian director with an eye for detail , set this story in her native land and also contributed with the adaptation of the novel with Charles McKeown . The result is an enjoyable film that will impress fans of this genre . John Malkevich does a fabulous job with Tom Ripley . Mr . Malkovich clearly understood the nature of Ripley and gives a cool performance . Dougray Scott , who is seen as Jonathan , is perfectly cast as the picture framer dying from cancer . Ray Winstone does what he does best in his take of Reeves , a cruel man who wants to get rid of his enemies by paying other people to do the dirty thing for him . Lena Headey plays Sarah , Jonathan's wife , who is horrified when she discovers what her husband has done . " Ripley's Game " shows a Liliana Cavani at a nice point in her career . The film has a beautiful music score by Ennio Morricone and a brilliant cinematography by Alfio Contini , who takes the film through several picturesque locations for the viewer's enjoyment .
555677	1406078	408304	8.0	A candid portrait of Rosie	Rosie Perez is a woman who has distinguished herself for her work in films and in the theater .

This 86 minutes is much too short as we get involved in the stories and the folklore the proud Rosie has to tell . There is also a comprehensive history of Puerto Rico and the people that made it great . She pays tribute to Pedro Alvizu Campos , the man who did so much for the island without asking anything in return . Also , the 60s group , the Young Lords ' work in the community is pointed out . The narration by Jimmy Smits serves well the documentary , but it's Rosie's personality and ebullience that keeps us wishing for more and more .
555798	1406078	443446	8.0	Family secrets	Sabina is a woman who seems to have it all : a job she loves , a nice boyfriend , and a great apartment . Yet , Sabina is carrying a heavy burden in her heart . It all comes to a head when she has to make a decision about the death of her parents , as we witness at the start of the film . All the bottled emotions are struggling to come out as she decides to spend Christmas with her brother Daniele in America . She wants to see her older sibling in order to make sense of her past and get closure with a horrible past . Sabina's boyfriend Franco , an actor , is selected to be in a soap opera . Being a theater actor , he is not completely satisfied with the idea , but being realistic , he has to compromise . Sabina , in parting , asks Franco not to see other women while she is away , knowing well the way things are in the world where Franco moves . Instead of being a joyous reunion , both siblings show a restraint in the way the visit develops .

It takes a while for Daniele to open up to Sabina because she wants to get to the bottom of the secret that has damaged them both for life .

She is the daughter of the distinguished Italian director Luigi Comencini . She has learned well as she sets her story with great precision , creating characters that one can relate to . The best thing in the film is the work of Giovanna Mezzogiorno . She brings life into Sabina , something that with another actress might not have been as easy . Ms . Mezzogiorno is simply splendid because she makes us care for this wounded woman who is searching for closure in understanding what was done to her at an early age . Equally excellent are Alessio Boni , who appears as Franco , the boyfriend , and Luigi LoCascio makes an impression as Daniele . Both these actors continue to surprise .
555623	1406078	231968	8.0	Overcoming prejudice	This nine minutes short film packs more in it than some full length features . Don Weis directed this little gem in which prejudice is dealt with in a subtle manner . A poignant story by Lucille Schlossberg was the basis for the screen play written by Allen Rivkin . It's a simple story . A soldier , whose buddy has died in combat , comes to pay his respects to his mother . Mrs . Wrenley appears to be glad to receive in her home this young man , JoJo , who has brought the last letter he received from the dead soldier . When he mentions his name , Maxie Klein , Mrs . Wrenley clearly changes from the welcoming lady that is happy to meet her son's friend into a woman whose prejudice indicates she resents the intrusion . She can't even understand how his son could have been friendly with the man in front of her . When Maxie offers to read her son's letter , she doesn't refuse . She can't believe what she is hearing as her son talks about tolerance and acceptance he has seen in the army . It's too much for her to digest , but she realizes the goodness in Maxie Klein's heart as her attitude toward him melts away . The film shows excellent performances from Marjorie Main and Keefe Brazelle , the two characters in the short .
555900	1406078	479230	8.0	Spaniards in Switzerland	Spain in the 1950s and 1960s was still a poor country . Like Italians , Portuguese , in other less industrialized European nations , Spaniards that couldn't make a decent living in their own country emigrated to Germany , Switzerland , and France , where there were more possibilities for them . The idea was for the head of a family to go , start working , save as much as he could to send it back home . Martin and Pilar , a young couple , have to live with his parents in the basement apartment in the building where the older man is the super . Pilar , who had her eye in a new building in the outskirts of the city has given a deposit for the apartment she thinks is her salvation from living with the in-laws . Imagine Martin's surprise when he learns she has spent their savings for the down payment for an apartment and he has just been laid off . Marcos , one of Martin's friend , also unemployed , tells him about his intention of emigrating to Switzerland . He has heard mechanics are needed for the Swiss factories . Without no working permission the two embark in the adventure of their lives . They must leave family behind and enter Switzerland without work permits ; both men are lucky not to be sent back home . The small town they decide to try their luck has a small factory where they eventually land jobs . Martin and Marcos are not prepared for the shock they receive in a country that proves to be as different from theirs like day and night . They land jobs , eventually . They have settled in a small pension in town where Hannah , the woman who runs the place doesn't understand her guests . The result result in funny situations where the Spaniards ' more affable character prove to be a winning card for them . Loneliness proves to be hard for the men as their spouses are so far . Martin has an involvement with the kind Hannah . Pilar , who has decided on her own to go to Switzerland to join her husband , has spent a year's worth of remittances from Martin in the apartment that she supposedly has bought , but in reality she was duped from an unscrupulous building agent . When Pilar arrives , she senses how her husband has been having an affair , but nothing much comes out of it when they find an apartment of their own . Their life takes a nice rhythm in their new adopted country . Years go by , and after Martin's father's death , they decide to go back home , a sad mistake for the whole family . Carlos Iglesias , who wrote , directed , and starred in this film , is someone new to us . His nostalgic look at what appears to be a biographic picture , has some great moments that reflect a bygone Spain , a poor country during the years where the action takes place . The film is a hymn to those men that went to make a living , living family and friends behind . It's clear Mr . Iglesias knows what he is talking about and what comes out in the film is a loving tribute to those men who sacrificed it all in order to help their impoverished families . The director , who plays Martin , has some good moments in the film , especially the beginning of his life in the new country . Javier Gutierrez is also quite appealing as Marcos . Nieves DeMedina , is seen as Pilar , in a touching performance . Isabel Blanco , who plays Hannah , was a surprise . " Un franco , 14 pesetas " proves the point that for some emigrants that try to go back home find it almost impossible to adapt themselves to a pace and an atmosphere in the old country that seems alien to them now , as it's the case with Martin's son who can't adapt himself to the Spanish ways . These people have invested a lot of their lives in a new culture and adapted with a lot of effort , so going back is not exactly easy for most of them . Leaving comforts for an uncertain life back home is not something most of these families would even consider .
554648	1406078	257850	8.0	A murder in Wyoming	A young gay man brutally killed by two young men trying to make a point about their hatred of homosexuals is the basis of Moises Kaufman's brilliant play seen here a few years ago . On the stage the play is somewhat detached because of the limitations in the text , but as a film , adapted for the screen by Mr . Kaufman , the immediacy of the story is more shocking than in the theater . " The Laramie Project " is seen in a documentary fashion . The director and his assistants went to Laramie to investigate the incident that caused a world wide uproar because of the savage way Matthew Shepard's death had caused . In recreating the facts , Mr . Kaufman has dramatized the story by having real actors play the different people in town with whom he and his collaborators talked during the days of the research trip . What comes out about the story is that individually , the citizens of Laramie were as shocked as everyone else was . After all , they considerer themselves as pretty tolerant , so why a horrible tragedy like this could ever happened amongst them ? In fact , it only takes a pair of misguided individuals , who think thought they would make a statement by inflicting on the unsuspecting Matthew Shepard a punishment he didn't deserve . The ensemble cast that play the different parts is an inspired choice . Mr . Kaufman was lucky in amassing such talent that respond so well to his commands . Steve Buscemi , Camryn Manhein , Laura Linney , Amy Madigan , Frances Sternhagen , Christina Ricci , Margo Martindale , Kathleen Chalfant , Terry Kinney , just to name a few , give excellent readings about what really occurred in Laramie . Ultimately , Mr . Kaufman makes his point by just letting the citizens of Laramie come to terms with the horrible tragedy that shook their town .
556040	1406078	389871	8.0	Con man	Corruption was rampant in Peru at the beginning of this century after the collapse of the Fujimori regime . The economy was in shambles as everyone felt the squeeze and had to resort to do whatever in order to make ends meet . We meet first Rafo and Laura , a young couple that owe three months ' rent . Their landlady is getting impatient , but lets them stay in the apartment . Rafo wants to sell his big Chevrolet convertible , but when he finds out how much it will fetch , he decides to keep it . As he and Laura come out of a local market , they are accosted by a man with a young girl who pretends to know him and asks him for help . Rafo realizes he is a street swindler . Lima was full of these people . We meet Salvador , an affable Spaniard , next , as he goes to a five star hotel pretending to be in charge of a company expecting a group of Japanese tourists that will arrive the following day . He talks to the attractive receptionist , who gives him information he shouldn't have . As Salvador emerges from the hotel , he sees an awaiting taxi at the door and hails it . As it turns out , Jaime , the driver , had gone to see his receptionist daughter . Jaime , who is unemployed has resorted to driving a taxi in order to make a living . He is charmed by Salvador into driving him around Lima , something that Salvador doesn't intend to pay . The Spanish man , we realize is a con artist also , but working on a more refined level . Salvador is the key figure in the story as he is the one that ties up all the different narratives . The victim turns out to be Rafo , who , unaware of Salvador's real intentions , falls for the great deal the Spaniard has in store for him . " Doble juego " directed by Alberto Durant was a real surprise . In many ways . It remindeded us of the Argentine film " 9 reinas " , but this is entirely different as the director deals with totally unrehearsed chain of events where street smart people fall victim in ways they shouldn't have fallen . Rafo is played by Fabrizio Aguilar . Fernando Cayo makes a great impression as Salvador , the con man . Giancarlo Brero , one of Peru's leading actors has only a small part , but he makes the best out of it . Mari Pili Barreda , Gianela Neyra , Katia Condos and the rest of the cast do an excellent job for the director . " Doble juego " , ( also known as " Con Game " ) is a fun film with a fast pace that will delight viewers as it shows a talented director , Alberto Durant , at top form .
555392	1406078	110427	8.0	Entrapped	This film was shown as part of a Vancouver Film Festival several years ago , where also Mr . Perez's " La Vida es Silbar " was presented in 1999 . Last night it was shown as part of CUNY Cinematheque . One can't help but to think that Madagascar is the continuation of Hello Hemingway , which was presented last week in the same venue . Could it be that director Fernando Perez is continuing the story about what happened to the young girl in the first film after she grew up and had her own family ? It seems to this viewer it could be possible . The mother and the daughter are trapped in their surroundings . They are constantly moving around . What happened to the mother , as a young woman , is happening to the young girl right now . The young Laurita wants to get away from it all , the same way as her mother did in the first story . Looking at the young woman one can predict that maybe at one point in her life , she might commit suicide . Also , Laurita seems to be totally disenchanted by what life has dealt her . The mother's world is very limited . She goes to her teaching job , although one never sees her tutoring anyone . She sits in the faculty room , surrounded by bored teachers . She is finally recognized by the dean of the university , but at that moment she is given a postcard from a former student that has gone to Paris . She tells a fellow teacher she couldn't care less to know Paris , or London or Rome , perhaps because it is impossible to even think about going away from the responsibility of having her mother and daughter to support . Also , the teacher one sees sharpening the pencil announces she will be going to another town , away from the capital . The mother recalls her youth several times , once mentioning the fun she had with a mulatto friend who turned into a model and how she also had pet mice but all disappeared leaving only the female behind . Could she be saying they have been left behind by men that went abroad ? At the height of her despair , she burns a chicken dish she is cooking and laments how everything is against her . The grandmother's role is very symbolic in that she is seen playing monopoly , a game that wouldn't mean anything in a marxist society . We hear her while she is playing saying to her partner that she will buy as many properties as she can . Ultimately , isn't the title of the film revealing ? That society has failed , for reasons that also made the island of Madagascar socialist regime fail . Also , the island has become a prison where no one escapes , and nothing makes sense at all , be it because of the " special period " , or because the ' blockade ' of the country . Fernando Perez obviously knows what he is saying , very well . It is a piercing look he is sharing with us . It is probably very painful for the director to tell it , but he had the courage to do it .
555069	1406078	421239	8.0	Air travel is not what it used to be !	Wes Craven , a man who knows a thing , or two , about scaring the viewer , is at it again with his new film , " Red Eye " , which proves to be a surprising late summer entry . As a thriller , the film owes a lot to the director . The screen play by Carl Ellsworth is clear and it makes sense with a plot that could well happen . Lisa Reisert is used to working with the demanding public she has to deal with on a daily basis as one of the managers of the luxury hotel in Miami where she probably has to use all her tact in order to keep the egos of the guests that come to the hotel looking to be pampered . Having been to her grandmother's funeral in Texas , she is on her way back home when her flight takes a lengthy delay . Lisa meets on the checking line a young man , Jackson Rippner , who shows an interest in Lisa , and who , surprise , surprise , is seated next to her on the flight ! It turns that Jackson has more than a passing fancy for the beautiful Lisa . As a thriller , the film packs a lot in its action . We never feel bored , or let down by what Mr . Craven has in store for us . The acting , especially by the brilliant Cillian Murphy , who plays Jackson , is first rate , like anything this young actor does . Ms . McAdams is also good as the spunky girl who will not let anyone put one over her . The supporting cast has Brian Cox , Jayma Maya , and Jack Scalia , among the players . " Red Eye " is only eighty five minutes long , but it certainly will thrill any fans of Mr . Craven and of the genre .
555154	1406078	374546	8.0	The five seasons	This is a hypnotic film to watch . The beauty of it lays in the simplicity in which it has been told . Director Ki-duk Kim's images feel like paintings by great masters . This story about Karma and Buddist beliefs could have used a bit of trimming to make it more appealing , since at times it is too static . This is a film to stay away for those interested in fast action or special effects . No one is going to find them here . What the viewer will get is a feeling of well being and inner peace . The director seems to be teaching us a lesson in how anyone can achieve nirvana through self examination , meditation and doing good no matter to whom . Also , how cruelty , be it against a harmless animal , or a human being , will haunt those who transgress throughout life . The acting blends in with the serene beauty of the temple in the middle of the lake , as we watch one season following another , as seen by the amazing cinematography by Dong-hyeon Baek .
554684	1406078	293007	8.0	History repeats itself	This film opened in this country recently , right after another prison massacre in Brazil , where inmates were killed after they rioted . Hector Babenco's film is a sad commentary on society's failure to turn these criminals in jail , into law abiding citizens . If anything , this film could be a vivid reminder to law breaking people about what they can expect when they have to pay their debt and must serve time under conditions such as the one we see in Carandiru prison . Add to that the horrible conditions of jails in certain parts of the world . Any would be criminal should think twice about the consequence of their actions . Landing in a penal institution is a hellish experience , at best . How can lawmakers of the world think that a criminal mind will be changed by sending them to places such as Carandiru ? If anything , placing these criminals with other criminals in such conditions will perpetuate crime and if the prisoner survives the term , he will be scarred for life . Not having read the book in which this film is based , it is only fair to say that Mr . Babenco , an excellent director , has given us a realistic film about what hell must be like .
555496	1406078	299478	9.0	Farewell Suite	It's in a way fitting , that Ingmar Bergman , one of the cinema's best directors , to choose to depart in this fashion , by expanding on an early work , which was by all accounts fully realized , or so we thought . In " Sarabande " we are reunited with Johan and Marianne , the protagonists of " Scenes from a Marriage " . Mr . Bergman seems to have composed a suite in which the Sarabande movement , which is usually introspective and dark , gives the tone to his account in this new work . If you haven't seen the film , perhaps you should stop reading now . When we last saw Johan and Marianne they gave the impression their relationship was over . We get to know in " Sarabande " that yes , it really happened , but that a lot of years have passed between the lovers without any actual contact between them . Usually , when intense love affairs end , both partners stay away from one another . It comes as a surprise that Marianne will even try to see Johan after all the intervening years . When we first meet Johan , he appears to be much older than what he really is . Time has not been kind to him , or so it appears . Marianne , on the other hand is still an interesting woman , who of course , is much younger , but the contrast heightens what appears to be a gulf now between them . Things are complicated with the introduction of Henrik , Johan's own son , who has moved to a cottage in the property , where he is living with his daughter Karin . Henrik's wife has died , but her picture seems to dominate their lives . In fact , there is something incestuous in the relationship between Henryk and Karin . We watch them in bed , although there's nothing improper about it , but we start to get a different image of what really is going on in the cottage . At one point Karin kisses her father in a way that it confirms the love-hate emotions within Karin's heart . She is trying to break away from this situation in whatever way she can . In a way we realize that Johan , who seems to hate Henrik , perceives what is going on , but he doesn't have the strength to confront this sad man that is his son . Maryanne , stays away from the feud going on between father and son . It's clear she feels deeply for Karin , a girl that has gained her trust , but there she feels nothing for Henrik . The acting is first rate , as in most of Mr . Bergman's films . He has the uncanny gift to get great performances from his cast , as it's the case with " Saraband " . Liv Ullmann and Erland Josephson are perfect as the one time lovers Marianne and Johan . Borje Ahlstedt makes an unappealing and tormented Henrik . The luminous Julia Dufvenius is marvelous as Karin , the young woman , basically at the center of the story . This is a great coda for Mr . Bergman . He leaves us with an emotional charged film that will be treasured by all his fans .
555052	1406078	48281	9.0	Chamber music	" The Ladykillers " a delightful comedy of 1955 was one of the best films that came out of England in that period . Alexander Mackendrick , the director , had the fortune of working with the screen play by William Rose , making this a classic movie from the beloved Ealing Studios . The master plotter , Profesor Marcus , finds in Mrs . Wilberforce , the perfect landlady ! Her small home is near King's Cross station in London and so convenient for the place in which to plot the perfect caper . By using the rooms being let by the old , unsuspecting , lady , Professor Marcus realizes he has stumbled on a good thing that seems the excellent setting for the right place to be . So , Marcus pretends to want to use the space for the string quintet he leads to rehearse . What Mrs . Wilberforce doesn't suspect is that her house is being used to plot a robbery from the station . Of course , there is no such thing as a perfect crime . There is always an innocent detail that gives the criminals away . In this caper it's in the cello case that gets stuck in the door of Mrs . Wilberforce's entrance door that is the beginning of the end for the criminal gang . Alec Guinnes as Profesor Marcus had one of the best opportunities of his career . Katie Johnson , is delicious as the landlady who has no inkling of what is going on under her roof , but who at the end , seems to have profit from the surprising twist . Peter Sellers , Herbert Lom , Danny Green , Cecil Parker , are the other members of the criminal quintet . Thanks to Mr . Macendrick's direction this timeless classic will always delight viewers forever .
555346	1406078	140888	10.0	On the road	This film , which we watched at the Vancouver Film Festival years ago , turned up the other night on cable . On second viewing , the film still packs quite an impact , as it still feels real . The work of Walter Salles and Fernanda Montenegro was amazing then , and still is now . This is the story about a cynic and jaded woman who resorts to do menial work and who is a small con artist herself . Dora has seen better days . She is retired now , but in order to make ends meet , she sets a letter writing desk at Rio's train station where she writes letters dictated to her by the illiterate and eager people who can't do the job as they want to communicate with distant family and friends through Dona Dora . In many cases , as it's the case with the letter she has written for Ana , she has no intention of ever sending those missives dictated to her by the unsuspecting people . Josue , the small boy , who witness the death of his mother , is wiser for his younger years than one might suspect . He sees right through Dora as a charlatan and a con woman . When Dora takes the boy home , she has no intentions of ever helping him much more than a few days . Later , upon learning about the adoption agency , she sells the boy to the unscrupulous people involved in the traffic of children for a thousand dollars without any problems . It's only when her friend Irene tells her the fate that Josue will encounter , that Dora leaps into action . Since she can't stay home without having to return her money , she takes Josue on the road . This odd couple begins the journey as complete strangers , but this voyage will make them appreciate one another and even move Dora into becoming a better woman for having the courage to do the right thing . Josue also realizes that Dora , in her own way , has been , for however short , the mother he lost in the tragic accident . Fernanda Montenegro , perhaps Brazil's best actress , is amazing as Dona Dora . She is the whole reason for seeing the movie . Her Dora is one of the best creations in her film career . This intense performer shows an actress who fully understand who Dora is and the way she would behave in the situation . Young Vinicius Oliveira is a sweet Josue , and Marilia Pera , is the kind Irene , who makes Dora see the monstrosity of what she was about to do . The music by Jacques Morelembaum and Antonio Pinto is an asset , as it adds an atmosphere to the long journey of Dora and Josue . The interesting cinematography by Walter Carvalho , shows the immensity of Brazil's interior as the odd couple go to find the little boy's father . This film is a triumph for both Walter Salles and Fernanda Montenegro .
555660	1406078	281724	10.0	Strange behavior	Manhattan is a mecca for the lonely . Nowhere in the world can people survive for years without the need of communicating with other people . Some of them have absolutely no life , or in the case of these five characters in this fantastic documentary , these are people who put all their energy into escaping from the real world . Their refuge is the many film theaters of Manhattan that show non commercial programs such as the ones that attract them . How much can they absorb ? How much can they really enjoy the same films that attract them ? . Watching this documentary one can't really say . Of all five people analyzed in the film only Jack comes close to a normal person . He is a walking encyclopedia . He knows about cinema . I have seen him in numerous occasions and have talked to him . He is the source one wishes to have when one is thinking of an obscure passage of a forgotten film , domestic or foreign . His whole life revolves around the different showings around the city . His life is a mess , but at least , he gives the appearance of normalcy in comparison to the others . Roberta is an eccentric lady whose whole life revolves around collecting programs wherever she goes . She appears to go to films out of duty , not because she really enjoys what she is seeing . Her own anecdote of taking off her blouse during an air conditioned failure is a hoot . Talking to her after a film will give you no clue if she liked or disliked what she saw . She would be much better off staying home sorting out a whole lifetime at the movies and straightening the mess she lives in . I hate to see a fire in that tenement , or in some of the other apartments , for that matter . Co-directors Christlieb and Kijak know these people very well . They give us a bit of their world ; they have captured the essence of these five lonely souls in the big city .
555495	1406078	412019	10.0	Pink flower arrangements	Jim Jarmusch returns to the screen with an immensely pleasing film that looks extremely simple , but in fact , it's what is not being said that really is at the center of the picture . Mr . Jarmusch is one director that loves to work with an economy of everything . His films seem to be crying for a set decorator , but that is misleading , because it's the simplicity that seems to work in most cases . If you haven't seen the film , perhaps you should stop reading here . At the center of the story is Don Johnston , whose name seems to provoke in most people a recognition by associating it to the actor , Don Johnson . Nothing could be farther from the truth . Don is a taciturn man , who when we meet him is being dumped by his last girlfriend . Don Johnston , with his deadpan demeanor , appears to be a man that has gone through life on auto pilot . In fact , when he receives the letter that will , in a way , change his life , he doesn't even react . His solution to the problem is to show this letter to his next door neighbor , Winston . Little does Don knows , but Winston maps out a plan to get him involved in the solution of the mystery he is presented . We accompany Don in a trip of discovery to reacquaint himself with former lovers who might have been instrumental in sending the pink letter . Thus we meet Laura , the closet organizer , a widow now , living with a precocious daughter , Lolita , who seems to have jumped from the Nabokov's book , in all her precociousness . Then , there is Dora , the real estate woman who lives in a development in which all the houses look alike . We meet Carmen , the pet communicator , a sort of animal analyst who has turned her love interest another way . Finally , we are given a glimpse of Penny , who couldn't care less to see Don one more time . The opening sequence that sets the story in motion is nothing but perfection . We watch the fateful letter at the beginning when it's being dropped in the mail box right up to its delivery through Don's mail slot . Jim Jarmusch , and his amazing cast have done wonders with this film . Bill Murray is sensational as the jaded Don Johnston . Once again , this actor clearly shows he is at the top of the game . Jeffrey Wright , one of the best young actors working in films and in the theater these days , makes a valuable contribution as Winston . The women in Don's life are fantastic . Sharon Stone , Frances Conroy , Julie Delpy , Tilda Swinton , and Jessica Lange are seen at their best . Finally , two excellent turns by Alexis Dziena as Lolita and Chloe Sevigny as an assistant to Carmen . Mr . Jarmusch has created a film that says a lot about how modern relationships are being practiced these days .
556620	1406078	213905	10.0	Argentine realities	Rulo , the middle aged man at the center of this story , has to deal with all the present realities his country is going through . His friend Torres , is instrumental in finding him a job in a building project as a crane operator . He must pass a medical examination that reveals he is suffering from a strange disorder that keeps him awake after awakening for any reason at night , and he is overweight . This man has a son , Claudio , that like most of the Argentine youths don't seem to have a clear future . He has a rock band , but he sponges from his father whatever the older man can afford to give him . Rulo , who is somewhat proud of what Caludio is trying to achieve because he , himself , had his own musical group in the 60s and was a minor celebrity . That is quite a contrast from the present circumstances . Adriana , the owner of a small kiosk where Rulo goes to get his lunch , feels an attraction for him . She remembers the band and how she used to follow him in her youth . Nothing comes out of this possible relationship because Rulo , after a month of working in the building , loses the job because of the medical report . Torres , his friend , tells him to go South , to Comodoro Rivadavia , where his friend Santori will give him a chance . That , of course , seems to be the end for Adriana and Rulo , as she lets him know when he is ready to depart . Rulo's luck runs out even in that remote spot when labor troubles at the place where he is working . He is once more defeated and calls his mother . He doesn't want to tell her the truth , but as he asks for Claudio , who by now is living with the grandmother , Rulo reveals the truth and that he has to come back to Buenos Aires again , defeated . Pablo Trapero's " Crane World " has a look that reminds us of Italian Neorealism . The film is shot in black and white . Mr . Trapero uses improvisation with excellent results . The actors used , with a few exceptions , are people from his neighborhood in Buenos Aires . The places that were used are authentic and that's why the film has such an impact because it feels real . One marvels at this director who was able to put together an important film with so little , yet the picture is true of the Argentina after the excess of the Menen regime where practically all the industry had been sold to multinationals and the middle class of the country , a majority , suddenly saw themselves move a few notches down in the economic ladder . Best of the film is the great contribution Luis Margani brought to the film . We believe he is Rulo from the moment he first open his mouth . For being a non professional actor , Mr . Margani carries the film on the strength of his magnificent performance . Equally appealing is Adriana Aizemberg , an actress that is another natural . Her Adriana is devoid of mannerisms matching the style of Mr . Margani . They make a wonderful bittersweet couple that must deal with reality to keep on living , yet , they are not embittered by what life has given them . Daniel Valenzuela , Rolly Serrano , Graciela Chironi and Federico Esquerro make valuable contributions under Pablo Trapero's direction . " Crane World " is a slice of life as seen from Pablo Trapero a director who shows great integrity and presents us with his reality .
555298	1406078	151804	10.0	Acerbic look at the work place	Mike Judge knows quite well the characters he has gathered in a fairly large office . It could be anywhere in the country . Most of us spend most of our lives doing jobs that are not rewarding and they become a dull routine . In large places , like the one we see in the film , some of the supervising personnel are pompous and love to bully the people under them , which is the case with Bill , the coffee drinking supervisor , who loves to make Peter's life miserable with the petty little details , like not having the reports with the proper cover sheet . Milton , a lonely man , seems to live to go to work . He surrounds himself with the right things to put in his time at the job . One of his prize possessions is the red stapler that the cruel Bill , takes away from him , leaving him sort of naked in the office . There are also Samir and Michael Bolton , the only friends Peter can rely on , especially in the long coffee breaks they must take just after they have arrived at the office . Peter is lost in this milieu until two things happen to him . First , is the therapist that hypnotizes him and then proceeds to drop dead right in front of Peter , leaving him in a state of Nirvana . The other is the appearance of Joanna , the friendly waitress of the restaurant where the friends meet . This young woman is the one that brings Peter out of his shell as he falls for her big time . Joanna , who is made to wear about fourteen different pins in her uniform , is also dissatisfied with her own life until she finds in Peter a kind soul mate . Mike Judge , who wrote and directed this film , presents all these characters without making them stereotypes . We all have known them , in some form , or another , and yes , we can identify to the life they live because we have been exposed to most of these characters in our working lives . Ron Livingston makes Peter a personal triumph . He clearly understood his character and plays it without making a caricature . Jennifer Aniston was another surprise in the film . Her Joanna is one of her best screen work . Stephen Root makes a wonderful Milton , the strange man we have met before in our own life . Gary Cole is perfect as the supervisor without a clue . David Herman and Ajay Naidu are seen as Peter's office pals . We had not seen this film since its release and on second viewing it still holds our interest thanks to the excellent material Mike Judge wrote for the occasion where we see ourselves and our co-workers in the big screen .
555984	1406078	308213	10.0	Broadway baby	Elaine Stritch at Liberty is a splendid documentary about the life of a survivor , who even at this stage of her life , shows she has what it takes to get in front of the public and bare her soul in the process . The documentary centers around her triumphant stage show that played at the Public Theater , and later was transferred to a limited commercial run on Broadway and then to London . The material was conceived by John Lahr and directed for the stage by George C . Wolfe , the amazing man who was in charge of the Public Theater in New York . Rick McKay is given credit as putting it all together in this version that was seen on cable , and it's available on DVD format . Best of all is Ms . Stritch herself . We get to know intimate details about her life , her successes and failures , the men in her life and how the drinking affected her health . To have the courage to go before a public in a play is courageous , but to be Ms Stritch's age , command the stage and charm an audience is something that only great performers can achieve . Thanks for the memories Ms Stritch !
556435	1406078	43338	10.0	Trapped	A journalist from New York , Chuck Tatum , ends up in Albuquerque working for a local newspaper . He is a defeated man who has failed miserably because of his hard drinking , among other things . But his luck is about to change . After being sent to report on a rattle snake contest , he stumbles on a tragic situation where a miner has been trapped in an abandoned silver mine . Tatum recognizes the value of the situation as a news item that will , not only sell papers , but will , perhaps , give him the chance to make it big in the field he knows well . He risks his own life in going into the mine to interview Leo Minosa . In order to do that , he joins forces with the corrupt local sheriff Kretzer , who is game for what the deal will mean to his status in the community . In exchange for his efforts , he wants to be the exclusive rights to the situation . Tatum meets the miner's wife , a one time saloon girl , Lorraine , who Leo rescued from an uncertain life and brought her to the family's restaurant in the dusty desert area . Lorraine sees an opportunity to flee the scene , something that she has done before , but Chuck Tatum wants her as part of the scheme he has plotted in his mind . When the human story hits the airwaves , it finds a captive audience . Soon , all curiosity seekers descend on the area next to the mine to witness whatever happens . Instead of using conventional methods , Chuck decides to " milk " the situation by not doing what reason dictates must be done . He decides to direct the drilling from the top , a process that will delay the rescue operation , but will give Tatum a chance to gain the notoriety he seeks , at the expense of the man pinned down in the mine . This film , directed by the great Billy Wilder , is one of his finest efforts in Hollywood . Yet , the film didn't find an audience , unlike the one attracted within the film . Written in collaboration by Mr . Wilder , Lesser Samuels and Walter Newman , the screenplay is one of the most ambitious in the director's distinguished career . He knew exactly where he wanted to know , using as a theme the manipulation of the news by people that only want to show sensationalism , at the expense of a human suffering . Kirk Douglas had one of his finest moments in the movies with his Chuck Tatum . He knew exactly what the public wanted and he gives it to them . In a way , he was a great impresario , setting the scene for the curious to come to the show to be on the front row to witness the suffering and pain Leo Minosa was experiencing . Jan Sterling , who plays Lorraine , matches Mr . Douglas all the way . She could see inside the man who didn't care about a husband that she was going to abandon , anyway . The rest of the cast does a fine job . Charles Lang's cinematography captures in vivid detail the carnival atmosphere that is at the center of the film . His camera angles enhance the film tremendously . Hugo Friedhofer provided the musical score that blended perfectly with the action . Arthur Schmidt editing works well . Ultimately this was a Billy Wilder film that will stay in the viewer's memory for quite a long time .
555936	1406078	313196	10.0	Hypocrites in heaven	This film from Mexico , based on a novel by Portuguese author , Eca de Queiroz , was a surprise . It shows what a talented director , Carlos Carrera , can create with the material and the cast assembled to play it . Credit has to go to the scenario written by Vicente Leñeros , adapting the original material and bringing the action to present day rural Mexico . The turmoil within the Catholic church is in the headlines of the media and this story deals with the hypocrisy of father Amaro in not practicing what the church wants him to teach these poor people . Instead of presenting the priest as a pedophile , it shows us this man as a normal person with an obsession for a beautiful young woman who is attracted to him as well . Poor Amalia , the young woman , in the story , she is repeating what her own mother is doing on the sly with the older priest , father Benito , something that young father Amaro gets to know as soon as he arrives in the small town he has been assigned to serve . In many rural areas of Latin America these men have been known to develop entanglements such as the one we see with father Benito and Amelia's mother , La Sanjuanera . After the mutual attraction comes out of the surface , father Amaro thinks of nothing about seducing Amelia against his better judgment . His is a passion that can't be stopped ; it will prove the younger's priest downfall . Gael Garcia Bernal is an excellent actor , as he has demonstrated in Amores Perros and Y tu mama tambien . He goes surprising us from one film to the next in that he's always believable ; he never makes a false move , or strike a wrong note . Had he been an actor in the USA , he would have been a household face by now . Obviously , he makes very good choices getting involved in the right films . The rest of the cast is very effective . Sancho Garcia as father Benito is very good . Ana Claudia Talancon has a lovely face . Her Amelia is all trust and love for a man that wasn't worthy of her . The ending where father Amaro is celebrating mass sends a shiver of fear as we realize that he is remorseless of what he has done and will have no one to answer for his crime . He will probably go to bigger and better things since the church , obviously has prepared him to be what he is : a hypocrite and a coward !
556061	1406078	39689	10.0	Scheming dame	Jacques Tourneur will probably be remembered best for this film , even though he had an extensive career in Hollywood . Working with Daniel Mainwaring , the author of the novel in which this movie is based , he created one of the best pictures of this genre , one that will be a perennial favorite . Mr . Tourneur and his cinematographer , the brilliant Nicholas Musuraca , made a stunning looking film that looks as good today , as when it was originally released . If you haven't seen the film , please stop reading now . Jeff Bailey has reinvented himself as the owner of a gas station in California . His past comes to haunt him at the beginning of the movie . Jeff has found peace and love in the small town where he has taken refuge . He can change his identity , but he can't hide from the people that want to see him dead . We watch in the beginning how Jeff is sent away by Whit Sterling to look for the disappearing Kathie Moffat , who has stolen forty thousand dollars and gone hiding . Jeff finds her in Acapulco . Kathie gives a bad name to any other dames in the movies of this genre . She is totally ruthless ; she will do anything to double cross Whit as well as have Jeff do whatever she wants . Comparisons have been made between " The Maltese Falcon " and " Out of the Past " . Both have plots that are twisted ; when we feel we know everything , there is a new twist to the story . We are constantly misled into thinking one way , when in reality , something else has happened . This is a film that combines all the elements of the classic film noir and juxtaposes it against the serene surroundings of where Jeff is now living . Black and white photography was used to great advantage in the movie . It has a style that makes it one of a kind . The music by Roy Webb plays neatly in the background without interrupting the action . The acting is first rate . Mr . Tourneur got a brilliant performance from Robert Mitchum . His Jeff , is the epitome of coolness . It's hard to understand the mentality of American cinema of the times not paying Mr . Mitchum his due . He was a much better actor than he was given credit for . His presence looms large in this movie and it's a tribute to him that he makes his character dominate the movie . Jane Greer was also excellent in her take of Kathie Moffat . She is pure evil , a sensuous woman who will do anything to get her own way . When we see her in Acapulco she is a seductress that no man can resist . She leads Jeff on by the sheer power of the desire he feels for her . Ms . Greer was not a beauty , by Hollywood standard , but yet , she makes an incredible contribution to the movie . Her textured performance is exquisite in its economy . We all see right through her , yet , she takes us for an incredible ride , up to the end of the picture . The others in the cast do an excellent job . A young and dashing Kirk Douglas is perfect as the dubious Whit . He shows such a magnetism , even then , at the start of his career in movies . Rhonda Fleming had a small role and she makes most of it . Also Virginia Huston , as Ann , makes a great contribution to the film . The film , ultimately , is a tribute to the talent of the director . This is Mr . Tourneur's best movie .
554570	1406078	497116	10.0	Ecology according to the ex-future president of the United States	Al Gore's involvement with the environment is at the center of this wonderful documentary directed by Dennis Guggenheim . The film is basically the lecture Mr . Gore has toured the world to point out the problems caused by men as our world is suffering from a series of catastrophic events that , in his view , could have been easily prevented , had governments paid a close attention to clues the scientific community has been pointing out for quite some time . Unfortunately , it appears that our country is one of the ones to be blamed the most for not controlling the hot gas emissions that are thrown into the atmosphere . The last sequence of the documentary is the most poignant one . We are shown how insignificantly small our own planet is in relation with the rest of the universe . Only watching it in the way it's presented in the film , some of us will be humbled in learning how small and vulnerable we are , which makes Mr . Gore's point to try to salvage our planet by whatever means we can .
555244	1406078	253474	10.0	To hell and back .	The Pianist is an incredible film in many aspects . Roman Polanski's account of the survival of the pianist , Wladyslaw Szpilman , is a document about how one man can overcome the worst possible situations in a world gone completely mad around him . The only fault one can find with the adaptation of Mr . Szpilman's story by playwright Ronald Harwood , is the fact that we never get to know the real Wladyslaw Szpilman , the man , as some of the comments made to this forum also have indicated . There is a very interesting point raised by the the pianist's father who upon reading something in the paper , comments about how the Americans have forgotten them . Well , not only the Americans , but the rest of the world would not raise a finger to do anything for the people that were being imprisoned and made to live in the confined area of Warsaw . The exterminating camps will come later . What is amazing in the film , is the frankness in which director Polanski portrays the duplicity of some Jews in the ghetto . The fact that Jews were used to control other Jews is mind boggling , but it was a fact , and it's treated here matter of factly . Had this been made by an American director , this aspect would have never surfaced at all . Yet , Mr . Polanski and Mr . Harewood show us that all was not as noble and dignified as some other films have treated this ugly side of war . Wladyslaw Szpilman , as played by Adrien Brody , is puzzling sometimes , in that we never get to know what's in his mind . He's a man intent in not dying , but he's not a fighter . He accepts the kindness extended to him . He never offers to do anything other than keep on hiding , which is a human instinct . He will never fight side by side with the real heroes of the ghetto uprising . His role is simply to witness the battle from his vantage point in one of the safe houses across the street from where the action takes place . Adrien Brody is an interesting actor to watch . As the pianist of the story he exudes intelligence . There is a scene where Szpilman , in one of the safe houses he is taken , discovers an upright piano . One can see the music in his head and he can't contain himself in moving his fingers outside the closed instrument playing the glorious music from which he can only imagine what it will sound in his mind . The supporting cast is excellent . Frank Findlay , a magnificent English actor is the father of the pianist and Maureen Lipman , another veteran of the stage , plays the mother with refined dignity . In watching this film one can only shudder at the thought of another conflict that is currently brewing in front of our eyes . We wonder if the leaders of the different factions could be made to sit through a showing of The Pianist to make them realize that war is hell .
555621	1406078	443496	10.0	Edmond awakens to reality	Edmond looks like a man that is not in touch with reality , when one first meet him . He is leaving the office and is told an appointment has been rescheduled for 1 . 15pm and it's handed a piece of paper with those numbers . The next thing he knows is he is standing in front of a fortune teller shop that has the same number on the door . As the cards are read , it appears Edmond is doomed . Those digits will prove fateful when he sees again that number 115 . Edmond Bruke is a man that has not dealt with reality for quite some time . After leaving his wife , he tries to assert himself with dismal results . He has no clue of what's going on in the seamy world of sex clubs . His reaction toward the price of drinks at the Allegro club , that was recommended to him by a man he has met before , shows an individual that has no clue as to what is going on . Edmond will try to bargain the price with other people he encounter , something strange from a man that one assumes has been a law abiding citizen all his life . It's hard to realize that Edmond will be naive enough not to think the three card Monte players are just plain hoodlums , as they blatantly cheat him , then proceed to rob him and beat him . Edmond keeps going in his pursuit of getting sex in the wrong places , with the wrong people . His encounter with a hustler makes him snap out of his old self and assume a new , more aggressive personality . This proves fatal during his encounter with the sweet Glenna , a waitress who should have known better than to have anything to do with this loose cannon . At the end , Edmond is caught in the same web he spun around him ; he is reduced to being a victim once again because his black partner will make him rethink all his prejudices when he is rendered helpless against a formidable foe . Since no one will listen to him , he joins the list of the people he resented before . His ranting and raving about who he hated before is made useless by what he has to endure at the end . Stuart Gordon , the director of " Edmond " , has done an amazing job in bringing David Mamet's play to the screen . It's typical Mamet dialog , terse and to the point . The only thing about the main character is disbelief in the transformation this sad man undergoes right before our eyes . Edmond appears to be a victim of the same society in which he lived before oblivious to people other than himself and his circumstances . That comes into question as he decides to try his luck among people that are completely opposite of what he is . Edmond , in the end , has to pay for his own mistakes in ways that abase him and his manhood . The obvious reason for watching this film is to catch a magnificent actor in action . William H . Macy has been associated with David Mamet for many years and it shows he is the man to translate that language for us . There is no false movements in his amazing performance . One cannot think another actor who could have done better justice to Edmond Burke the way Mr . Macy has . The other actor that comes close to perfection is Joe Mantegna , whose brief appearance in a pivotal role enhances the film . Both Mr . Mantegna and Mr . Macy are worth the admission price to the film . Bookem Woodbine , Julia Stiles , Debi Mazar , and the others in the cast do what they can , but they're overshadowed in their scenes with Mr . Macy . The great jazzy musical score by Bobby Johnston plays well within the context of the film . Denis Maloney's inspired cinematography shows the streets of Los Angeles , that are supposed to be seen as Manhattan's shabby side , in all its tacky seediness . Stuart Gordon shows great affinity to the work of David Mamet as shown in the finished product .
555852	1406078	40897	10.0	All that glitters is " gone with the wind . . . . "	John Huston's genius as a director is undeniable . From his beginning he showed an uncanny knack for getting not only excellent acting from his actors , but his movies always had a social conscience as well . Mr . Huston loved Mexico and it shows in this film . It must have been a difficult task for him directing his own father in the movie . After all , Walter Huston was a major star on his own right . Both father and son made a great contribution , John behind the camera , Walter in front of it . Basically the story is about men that have drifted into Mexico to escape jail , or in search of riches , as it was the case of the men that fate brings together in a Tampico shelter . Dobbs , Howard and Curtin start out as partners searching for gold in the Sierra Madre . They find it , but as luck will have it , none of them will live to be rich from what they find in that remote place . In the most ironic of film endings , this one will be a classic . After the trio finds gold , greed sets in . Friendship turns sour and the three friends become enemies . When the bandits finally catch up with an exhausted Dobbs , trying to go north , they beat him up and discover some sacks full of sand . . . . Humphrey Bogart as Dobbs is excellent . Of course , Walter Huston made the best out of Howard , the clever old man who has seen a lot in his life . He is the only one that discovers a happiness living the simple life among the friendly Mexicans that welcome him into their community . Finally , Tim Holt , as Curtin is perfectly cast as an honest man who has gone into the adventure without any expectations . The final sequence of Howard and the peasants riding their horses into the ' yellow dust ' is amazing , as it it incredible . In retrospect , it seems to be telling us that sometimes dreams of becoming rich the easy way will not be sustained , but honest work will be more rewarding .
555252	1406078	361596	10.0	Bowling for Iraq	The only positive thing that could come out of people hating this extraordinary documentary would be for them to rush to enlist to go to fight in Iraq . The news media chides away from showing people like that lady from Flint , Michigan , who is , as far as I'm concerned , the true heroine of the film . Her pain at having lost her son in Iraq is , at times , hard to take . All I could hear around me was quiet sobbing as she was telling us the story of the death of her son . Another thing missing from this war is the arrival of the coffins draped with American flags . And for that matter , no cameras have gone into the hospitals where these young soldiers who have lost hands , arms , legs , are recuperating from wounds they have suffered from the war . The general public has been kept uninformed about these young people so no one can witness the end result of the war . The Iraqi conflict should have ended a long time ago if children of privileged Americans would have died as a result of their being there . In one of the most hilarious segments of the film , we see a few Congressmen scurrying away from questions presented to them by Michael Moore . Of course they have children , but , no , these kids will never see a day of combat in their lives . We'll never see the Bush twins in beautiful downtown Baghdag any day soon ! The biggest horror of it all is the killing of innocent people during the bombings . The images of children's bodies being dumped in communal donkey carts are too much to take , as is the case with the Iraqi woman who is shown crying in front of the camera as she mourns for five dead relatives that just died in an raid . Regardless how one feels about the present administration , the facts are there for anyone to see and reflect upon the atrocities presented in the documentary . War is hell , no matter how anyone sugar coats it .
