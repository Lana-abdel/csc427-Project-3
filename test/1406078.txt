556597	1406078	66184	1.0	Leaving Las Vegas	It's unimaginable that George Stevens , the distinguished director that gave us " Swing Time " , " Shane " , " Giant " , among others , could have agreed to be associated with this dud ! I vaguely remember the Frank D . Gilroy's play , in which this movie is based , as a not too interesting night in the theater . Well , with the help of the author , the film was made under Mr . Stevens direction , and the results are there for anyone to judge ! The worst thing in the film is the running time ! At 113 minutes , it's way too long . The two principals are so miscast that it pains the viewer to watch them go through the motions feigning to love one another when probably the stars ended up hating each other for the duration of the shoot that took almost three months to be completed . Elizabeth Taylor was into one of her fatty periods while doing this movie . One only sees her in unflattering costumes that don't do anything for her . Those shmattes make her even look older and heavier , but Liz must have thought she was making a fashion statement , or who knows what went through her mind ? Warren Beatty is seen in the film as though he were under the influence . His take on Joe Grady , as directed , seems the kind of man that would be a turn off for Fran . After all , she was having a thing with a rich man who kept her in some kind of luxury . Mr . Beatty doesn't do anything to get us to like him . He is a loser , and that's that . Watch this film on a sleepless night . Maybe it'll provoke you to sleep and have great dreams about what this movie is not !
554838	1406078	245046	3.0	They won't always have Paris . . .	Whatever you think of this misguided and silly film , please don't tell Mary Louis Parker , Billy Crudup's girlfriend , he stunk big time in this disaster because she might not like you , and hit you , the same way she hit some fan who was bad-mouthing Billy in his last stage appearance in New York . Whatever was Cate Blanchett thinking when she accepted the title role in this stupid little number ? No one can believe for a moment all the goings and comings the screenwriter has plotted at the expense of truth and reality . I'm afraid that our Cate really has to have her little head examined and maybe one day she'll fess up the real reasons for getting near this project that makes absolute no sense at all , let alone the preposterous situation which situates " la Blanchett " in that God forsaken little town where she sticks out like a sore thumb . Billy Crudup is totally out of place in the company of people like Michael Gambon , or even Cate . His character is totally unbelievable and we cannot think of him as the brains behind all the work against the invading Nazi army . Sorry Ms . Armstrong , better luck next time . We have admired your work before , but films like these are beneath your best abilities . Try to get involved in an Australian theme , one that you're more familiar with , and give us something more dignified than Charlotte Gray , who , by the way , doesn't even have to change her name at all because no one could have cared less if she was Gray , Brown , Green , Black , Blue , Black , or just plain Jane Doe !
554562	1406078	424345	4.0	Minimum wagers	If success is measured by the size of an audience , or by the amount of laughs a film produces , then " Clerks II " could be deemed a failure . Judging by the reaction at a screening at the Angelika the other day , where the film is playing in two of the biggest theaters , and the couple of feeble laughs it provoked in an audience of less than thirty people , this movie is definitely not a winner . But never fear , Kevin Smith , a clever man , has made sure the film will resonate with the people that will go see the film based on their experience with the original " Clerks " , a much better , and wittier film than its successor proves to be . In many ways , sequels should be avoided because nothing can compare with the previous work , a lesson Mr . Smith should have applied to this misguided attempt to bring back the people of the first film for a reunion . Jeff Anderson , without a doubt , is what holds the movie together . His Randal is still irreverent and foul mouthed . On the other hand , Brian O'Hallaran doesn't fare better with his Dante . In fact , he seemed to be out of it throughout most of the film . The addition of Rosario Dawson , as the manager of Mooby's was a good idea . The cameo appearance of the incomparable Wanda Sykes , as the offended black customer , proves to be one of the highlights of the movie . What doesn't work out in this sequel is the big musical production number of " ABC " with choreography in the parking lot . Kevin Smith , who plays Silent Bob again , and Jason Mewes , who returns as Jay seem like an old joke gone bad . Time has not been kind to them , in spite of the fact they are still dealing " nickel bags " outside of Mooby's and making a lot of money with the profits from selling drugs . " ClerksII " seems to be targeted for an age group that thinks whatever Kevin Smith gives them is the Bible . One wonders how did the Weinstein brothers , who backed this film and only deal with sure hits , came to the conclusion this was going to make them a fortune and be a big successful picture . Best advice to future movie goers is to wait for the DVD .
555891	1406078	347474	4.0	Chronicle of boredom in Catalonia	One wonders how director Marc Recha's films make it to Cannes . Evidently someone thinks he must be the Enfant Terrible of Catalonian films , or something like that , at the expense of real talented directors that don't get the chance to go and make the scene in Cannes in May . At any rate , this film makes no sense . It's as slow as the other film I saw by this " genius " before . This came as part of the yearly festival of Spanish Films at the Walter Reade . We are led to believe the cream of the crop is being shown , but after seeing this " masterpiece " about boredom and strange lives in a small town , we shall be more careful in selecting anything directed by this man in the near future .
555050	1406078	863080	4.0	Architectural Digest	No mention if Ann Rivers Siddons adapted the material for " The House Next Door " from her 1970s novel of the same title , or someone else did it . This Lifetime-like movie was directed by Canadian director Jeff Woolnough . Having read the book a long time ago , we decided to take a chance when the film showed on a cable version of what was clearly a movie made for television . You know that when the critical moments precede the commercials , which of course , one can't find in this version we watched . The film's star is Lara Flynn Boyle who sports a new look that threw this viewer a curve because of the cosmetic transformation this actress has gone through . From the new eyebrows to other parts of her body , Ms . Boyle is hardly recognizable as Col Kennedy , the character at the center of the mystery . This was not one of the actress better moments in front of the camera . That goes for the rest of the mainly Canadian actors that deserved better . The film has a feeling of a cross between " Desperate Houswives " with " The Stepford Wives " and other better known features , combined with a mild dose of creepiness . The best thing about the movie was the house which serves as the setting .
556243	1406078	269499	4.0	Suspicion of foul play	If anyone ever wonder why is the French film industry in the terrible state is is , one could suggest a look at this picture to realize why . The director is Jewish . He obviously has an agenda to throw it in our face at every given moment . He starts in the opening scene when Charlotte and Yvan are having dinner with his sister and brother-in-law and immediately we get to know this poor goy is in deep trouble , and so are we . I mean , who cares what religion any one of these characters practice ? The film loses all sense of direction right away . Only in France can trash like this could be made under the pretense that something artistic is being shown . The story has potential but it goes into a coma and never recuperates . A waste of talent to have Terence Stamp do nothing , as well as Charlotte Gainsbourg . Let's hope no one will finance this genius in his next venture and spare us having to sit through another " masterpiece " like this in the future . My advice to M . Attal would be that he goes to Israel and study film direction under a great director , Dover Kosashvili , who makes Jewish stories so subtly that they are universal .
555707	1406078	315824	4.0	The big waste	Elmore Leonard should be more careful in selling his books to the movies . This is a perfect example of a miscalculation , knowing that the other attempt in 1969 to make a film out his novel was bad experience . Director George Armitage doesn't bring anything new to the film and the end result is an uneven movie that has a flat feeling . Not even Morgan Freeman , or Gary Sinise , could have saved this film . The problem seems to be with the screen play by Sebastian Gutierrez , or perhaps that in trying to make a film rated PG13 , the creators of " The Big Bounce " reshot a lot of the material and now , at times , it doesn't make sense . The best things going for the movie are the beautiful Hawaii scenery and the beautiful Sara Foster , who is a sight for sore eyes . Otherwise , don't expect to find much .
554698	1406078	486946	4.0	Uneasy riders	Four men who are experiencing middle age crises , come together to hit the open road in their motorcycles . Little prepare them for what they will have to face in places where butch biker culture is prevalent . These are straight men who act a lot as though they weren't , in many occasions . The one question that comes into one's mind is " What are John Travolta , William H . Macy , and Marisa Tomei , or even Ray Liotta , doing in the film ? " Well , maybe they needed to redo the decor of their stately mansions , or perhaps they needed to see a Beverly Hills orthodontist , or they were just hard up for some easy cash . Otherwise , it's hard to understand what motivated them to be in this silly comedy that will not add anything to their resumes . On the other hand , it's easy to see Tim Allen and Martin Lawrence involved in the project because they are basically television products that only aspire to just a certain degree of what could pass for " acting " . The film reminds us of better made films like " City Sleekers " , just to name one . Directed by Walt Becker with a screenplay by Brad Copeland , it will probably become a favorite of many in the reruns .
555142	1406078	483763	4.0	Life is a beach	Poor Ginger Gainor , she would love to take her family to a California beach where she vacationed and has the fondest memories of that time . She is an uptight real estate woman who might have the best intentions in wanting to show that part of the country to her family , but little does she realize , no one really wants to go ! Her family , though , really enjoy going to Branson , where they feel ' at home ' and are surrounded from people like them , so why bother ? . Ginger is , what appears to be , a take charge woman , who does everything by the book and even calculates how long they will spend traveling from Omaha to California ! Unfortunately , things don't work the way Ginger wants . Things have a way of happening to her that completely derail her carefully laid plans . Ginger is defeated by everyone and everything , so guess where the family will head , after all ? Yes , you guessed it ! What is Lea Thompson doing in this movie ? She certainly deserved better . The movie will not add anything to her film career . The idea might have looked better in the written script by Linda Voorhees , who also directed , but alas , it doesn't translate to a fun time at all .
555074	1406078	903014	5.0	What was Mary Louise thinking ?	The first thought that came into this viewer's mind was to question Ms . Parker on her choice of vehicles . After having seen her in the New York stage in the brilliant " Dead Man Cell Phone " , one can't only guess it was a project that looked good in the written page and it turned out to be a different thing when it started shooting . Granted , Margaret Atwood's novel is not exactly the easiest thing to adapt for the big screen , or even television , as it's the case with this ill conceived idea . Our only suggestion to this talented actress is to stay in New York where she seems to have a knack for choosing plays in which to shine , as she has proved with " How I Learned to Drive " and " Proof " , just to mention two other plays in which she shone . While this is not a horrible film , by any means , the people behind it seem to have not get the essence of Ms . Atwood's work by the way it's presented . Better luck next time .
555041	1406078	102220	5.0	A stolen life	Having read Ira Levin's novel , and having seen the original film , and now this remake , one can only conclude this was a misguided project that doesn't add anything to the basic premise , or expand on it . Director James Dearden , who adapted the material for the screen , made a tactical error in making the Carlsson sisters as identical twins . Then , whoever cast Sean Young in the pivotal role of Ellen / Dorothy needs to have his head examined . Ms . Young , who showed some promise when she started appearing in movies , is totally unconvincing in this movie . The only reason for watching the film is Matt Dillon , who is always an interesting presence on the screen . His Jonathan Corliss , the disturbed young man who resents what life had in store for him , is made to look bad from the beginning . Since Mr . Dearden starts the film at the most crucial point of the story , doesn't give the audience a cause as to why Jonathan acts the way he does . The other tactical error happens when Jonathan , who is not Jay , arrives with Dorothy by car and eliminates the young man who holds the key to the mystery and is going to show Dorothy the year book in which Corliss appears . We don't believe for a moment he was physically able to do the deed . Ditto what happens with Patricia Farren doesn't make sense at all . Mr . Dearden asks a lot from the viewer and he is not too subtle about the way he presents the material . Max Von Sydow is totally wasted and Diane Ladd has only a couple of scenes . Watch the 1956 original directed by Gerd Oswald !
556334	1406078	254455	5.0	Sex according to Julio Medem	Has anyone picked up the trend of Spanish film directors ? When they don't have anything better to say , or to present anything worthwhile , they resort to showing sex , preferably , female genitalia , or even male apparatuses , to distract the naive viewer into believing they are watching something artistic . Well , not so . Ethel , a friend who lives in Madrid , and avoids the Spanish cinema like the plague , told me in two words what she believed this film to be about : CHEAP PORNO ! Never were there more clever words spoken ! Julio Medem , might be an intellectual in Spain , but he certainly cannot cut the mustard , as demonstrated by his previous output : Los amantes del circulo polar and Vacas . . . . Only in Spain , or in Europe , for that matter would anyone invest money into these disasters that pass as " art " films there as well as here . In the first place , the sex in the film is completely gratuitous and in your face . Paz Vega is an attractive woman , who no doubt will do better than in this movie . Frankly , I have no objection to have Paz Vega showing her charms all the time but the same should be expected of Tristan Ulloa ! So , if the director wants to reveal to us all what Ms . Vega has to offer , how about getting equal time and give everyone a view of what Mr . Ulloa has in store ? If we are going to be fair , then , let it all hang out ! The new Spanish Cinema isn't afraid to bare all to the world , but they don't have a clue what they're showing . Let's hope Mr . Medem talents will help him land a job as the director of the local Playboy , where he could really show it all without subjecting us to trash like this . The afternoon session I attended had a Viagra crowd . At the end , I overheard one man tell another : " Great Film , I've seen it about 10 times already ! . . . "
554943	1406078	73796	6.0	Hostage situation	The main reason for watching this thriller on the Fox cable channel was the cast . Not having a clue as to whether this movie was ever distributed in this country , but the allure of actors like Sean Connery and Ian McShane in its cast , proved to be the deciding factor for watching this 1975 British production directed by Finnish director Caspar Wrede . The film had the title " The Terrorists " , in the version we watched . After a series of bombs are detonated in London , we are taken to Oslo , where a group of terrorists have kidnapped the British ambassador to that country . The masked individuals demands are passed to the local security forces . Nils Tahlvik , the negotiator wants to put his own plan of action in place . There is a conflict with a British agent who wants to give in to the kidnappers ' demands , something that Tahlvik doesn't want to do . In the meantime , a commercial airliner , about to land at Oslo's old Fornebu airport is taken over by a group of hijackers . The captain takes a chance by making the tires of the plane blow up as they land . All attempts to surprise the kidnappers on board fail . As preparations begin to bring the ambassador and the men holding him to the aircraft , that by now has been fixed for an unknown flight , the police tries , unsuccessfully to send security forces masquerading as the criminals , but everything fails until the end when Tahlvik himself boards the aircraft and a surprise , that has been kept from us , is revealed . The screen play by Paul Wheeler is confusing , at best . We don't have a clear picture of what is really going on , that is complicated by the ending in which that surprise comes out of nowhere regarding one of the hijackers and the duplicity of someone in the negotiating team . Sean Connery is not at his best in the film . We get to see Mr . Connery as he looked at that time before any cosmetic enhancements , especially his teeth , which went through quite a change after this film was done . Ian McShane makes an interesting appearance as the evil Ray Petrie , who is in charge of the hijacking team on board the plane . Isabel Dean , has a good moment as the British ambassador's wife pleading with Tahlvik . While the film is by no means horrible , it could have been probably better with another film treatment and a action director . The best thing in the movie is Sven Nykvist cinematography , which unfortunately doesn't quite show in its splendor because of the faded quality of the copy that was shown .
555799	1406078	462519	6.0	Lie , lie , lie , and lie some more !	Imagine the poor nerd-like Roger , who is humiliated on a daily basis by his co-workers . He is such a pathetic individual that even the Big Brother group he mentors want to get rid of him . What to do ? How about enrolling in a school that will give him the skills that will help him overcome his own shortcomings . For that , he goes to Dr . P's school where supposedly he will learn , among other things , how to overcome his inability to deal with the tormentors he faces everywhere and then get to have great sex that has been denied to him . The premise of this comedy must have sounded great to the people behind the project . Todd Phillips , after all , is a major talent that has done much better . Writing the screenplay together with Scot Armstrong , and loosely based on the original English film of the same title , one would have expected a laughter riot . After all , the casting seemed made in heaven . The pairing of Billy Bob Thornton and Jon Heder , should have yielded an edgier comedy , but alas , it was not meant to be . One cannot blame the actors involved because the material given for them to act , doesn't hold many surprises . There are isolated parts that are funny and work . Most of the time the gags feel flat . Even though the end product is not what one expected , " School of Scoundrels " has its moments and it could be a film to watch with friends if the group is into a party mood .
556149	1406078	130205	6.0	The ghosts from the past	" Rag and Bone " was shown recently on cable . The promise of having been inspired by something written by Ann Rice , we decided to take a look . This film has a TV pilot written all over it . Robert Lieberman , has worked basically for television . The film doesn't show anything new , or break any new ground on the genre . The main annoying point is the thundering and lightning effect we see and feel , whenever anything supernatural is about to occur in the action . Instead of enhancing the point of view , it appears to work against what we are watching . The idea of a priest joining the New Orleans Police Department , is preposterous , at best , but we go along with the story . The conflict of interests , alone , is something that defies all logic , but one gives it the benefit of the doubt . The acting is adequate , although , as Tony Moran , the cop , Dean Cain , seems out of his depth . Robert Patrick , on the other hand gives a more assured performance as Sgt . Ryan . Based on what was presented , it was clear why this would be series didn't make it .
555542	1406078	342167	6.0	Fame at Camp Ovation	Todd Graff takes us to a summer camp designed for aspiring young people trying to break into the musical theater business . This is a film that will draw comparisons with the better made " Fame " , which , at least , had an original musical score . This one relies on the teen agers performing Broadway songs , mostly by Stephen Sondheim , who is seen briefly at the end of the film complimenting the music teacher in charge about what he as accomplished . The film presents us a devious character , Vlad , who is a young man probably seeking his own sexual identity . As played by Daniel Letterle , he shows he is a man aiming to please everyone . The openly gay Robin , played by Michael Flores , makes the best of his role with what he has been given to play . The rest of the cast tries hard to put on a good show under Mr . Graff's direction . The movie shows how Camp Ovation embraces all kinds of aspiring entertainers with the kind of tolerance one never sees in other more strict institutions .
555681	1406078	74287	6.0	The laughing windows	Having admired Pupi Avati's films , and having no clue about what this film was about , it was interesting to find this movie in DVD format . We don't recall if this film , a giallo , as far as genres go , ever was released commercially in this country , although , we can't recall that it was ever shown here . This horror picture was a collaboration between Pupi Avati and his brother Antonio . Watching the film recently , it has a faded look , even in the well restored transfer to DVD . The prologue , as the titles begin to offer a vision of a mad man as we hear his voice mumbling about his colors as someone is stabbed in front of our eyes , which should have played without the titles over what we are watching . We realize it's the voice of the painter whose fresco Stefano has been commissioned to restore . The opening titles are a distraction and one wonders if the Avatis did it on purpose , or was just an oversight . The film has some interesting ideas and it's creepy enough to send chills up one's spine . We realize from the start that the mad painter and his sisters were more demented and connected than really meets the eye . Stefano , the young fresco restorer that arrives in that rural community , should have insisted in staying in the hotel , where he is forced from , without explanation . Staying in the creepy haunted house where the old woman is bound to her bed , should have been avoided at all costs , but without that , there wouldn't have been a film ! " The House of the Laughing Windows " must have looked better when it was originally released . The plot , as a whole is uneven ; we sense what will follow , but we are not prepared for the conclusion at the church where Stefano realizes he is completely helpless and has been trapped by the same forces he was trying to fight . Pupi Avati has grown artistically since he directed this film , which should be seen as part as his growing and maturing as a director but only offers some minor surprises .
555107	1406078	109417	6.0	The proof is in the bullet !	John Bailey probably knew what he was getting into , when he read Roy Carlson's screen play , otherwise it doesn't make much sense to go ahead with a film that has been done better before . That said , " China Moon " is not a total disappointment . If you haven't seen the movie , please stop reading here . There are a few things that indicate that Rachel wanted to use Kyle from the beginning . There are also hints that Lamar , Kyle's detective partner , is into something . How could a good detective like Kyle fall prey to the exchange of the the bullet that is extracted from Rupert Monro's body ? The filmmakers take a chance in presenting a half baked pie to the viewers , many of whom are into mysteries , and think the plot will be taken at face value , when in reality , our minds are going in different directions . The fans of this genre solve the puzzle before the movie's conclusion . That said , the movie is easy to watch . Ed Harris , makes a credible Kyle . This actor is one of the best working in movies today , and even if it's not a good picture , Mr . Harris can be counted to give an excellent performance . His detective offers a good character study of a professional man that makes a fatal judgment when he gets involved with Rachel . Madeleine Stowe is a beautiful woman . In this movie she plays Rachel with conviction ; her scenes with Ed Harris shows clearly she can hold her own against anyone . Benicio Del Toro's Lamar , as Lamar , offers an interesting performance , something we expect from him as a matter of course . Charles Dance , as the rich husband who likes to fool around , is only seen too short . This is a movie to watch when the weather is bad outside . It will please anyone who doesn't expect too much .
555494	1406078	87096	6.0	No deal at Madonna Street !	Louis Malle lived in the USA during the last part of his life . If there was anyone with enough talent to bring " Crackers " to the screen , it was him . Unfortunately , sometimes , even with the best intentions , no doubt , a great man produces a film that is well beneath himself . Of course , anyone is entitled to a mistake , but if there was anything wrong with this project it seems to be the Jeffrey Alan Fiskin's screen treatment of the classic Mario Monicelli film " Big Deal at Madonna Street " . The cast Mr . Malle assembled for the film is a first rate one , just by looking at the names in it . Donald Sutherland , Jack Warden , Sean Penn , Christine Baranski and the rest have enough experience to show much better than what comes out on the screen . Let's just remember Mr . Malle for his greatness , and not by this misguided effort .
554933	1406078	412798	6.0	To the lighthouse	Rachel Carlson , who by the way was the name of a real novelist , lends her name to the character being played by Demi Moore in this film that seems to have " borrowed " different aspects of " Don't Look Now " and better made films of this genre as a vehicle for the star , an actress that shows to have no knack for choosing movie roles . After all , she deserves better . Unfortunately , the screen play by Craig Rosenberg , who also directed , doesn't make much sense . This seems to be a film that either the viewer loves it , as seems to be the case of most comments submitted to IMDb , or else hate it , as the other side seems to indicate . Our own experience was mixed . Demi Moore can be excellent with the right director behind her . Otherwise , she gives performances that will not add anything to her career . As a matter of fact , this film seems to have gone to DVD and cable right away , or at least , it has not garnered the wide audience the creators obviously wanted . There are some spooky elements in the film to get the viewer excited . It's just that as the film unfolds , it appears to be a case of deja vu . Or at least , we have figured it all out before it happens .
554740	1406078	86859	6.0	Odds and ends	Some classic films ought to be left alone , as is the case of " Out of the Past " , the Jacques Tourneur's 1947 movie , that can stand on its own . The idea that anyone can remake something that was well done before , or give it with a new treatment , usually ends up badly because we would be comparing the old picture with what someone has done with it now . Whatever possessed Taylor Hackford , an otherwise good director , to try his hand at changing the original , is beyond comprehension since it doesn't improve it , or change it , in a positive way . The film is loosely adapted from Daniel Mainwaring's screenplay . At times , watching this movie , we thought we were watching an adaptation of " Chinatown " , a movie it parallels because of the subject matter and the setting , without the originality . The plot makes no sense , which is probably what makes the new version so wrong . Jeff Bridges , an excellent actor seems to be out of place in the movie . Also , Rachel Ward , doesn't add anything to her portrayal of Jessie . Jane Greer , who appeared in the original film , returns as the ruthless real estate developer . Richard Widmark has nothing to do . James Woods character is also a puzzle . Perhaps the key to this movie is to watch it for the glorious Mexican locales of Cozumel , Chichen Itza and Tulum and listen to Phil Collins title song .
555224	1406078	486572	6.0	Man's best friend	Solo , a depressed young writer , is told by his analyst to get a dog ; this way , he will not feel as lonely . Little does he know that everyone he meets wants to have the dog ! Solo's life in Los Angeles is dull up until the time he decides to buy the dog in a shopping mall . Solo is not prepared for the work and the responsibility of owning a puppy , let alone trying to keep it to himself . This dark comedy was written and directed , as well as acted by Scott Caan . We were impressed by his " Dallas 362 " , his debut as a director . " The Dog Problem " shows a talented Scott Caan who no doubt will go to do better things , although this is not a movie for everyone since the material will be enjoyed by some audiences and hated by others . The best thing in the picture is , without a doubt , Giovanni Ribisi , who runs away with it . This actor keeps surprising us . He is not exactly a matinée idol , yet , he is always an interesting figure in any film in which participates . Scott Caan has a small role as a photographer . Lynn Collins , Mena Suvari , and the excellent Kevin Corrigan , are seen in minor roles .
556628	1406078	117283	6.0	Who is Bill Abernathy ?	Tom Thompson , a nerdy Brooklyn man , is 25 when we meet him . He still lives at home with his overbearing mother , occupying the same room he lived when he was a teen ager . Tom's placid existence comes to an abrupt stop when he receives a phone call from a Mrs . Abernathy , who proceeds to tell him about the death of her son Bill , who supposedly had been a school mate of Tom's , but as much as he tries to remember the departed classmate , he can't seem to remember . She invites him to be a pallbearer at the funeral . At the same time , Tom , who doesn't seem to have social graces at all , meets a young woman , Julie DeMarco , from his past . He always liked her , but being shy , never told her about the way he felt about her . All this happens at the time when Tom is trying to enlist his friends , Brad and Scott , to accompany him to the funeral . Little prepare Tom for the embarrassment he undergoes while delivering the eulogy . After all , he doesn't even remember the dead man ! To make matters worse , Julie , who knew the late Bill Abernathy , is appalled at the spectacle she sees . " The Pallbearer " , based on David Lipsky's novel , which we never read , was adapted for the screen by Matt Reeves , who also directs , and Jason Katims . The film evokes other films , specially certain aspects of " The Graduate " , or even the hit television series " Friends " , in which the leading man , had a prominent role . After watching the movie , we are going to make the point of reading the book , because it appears this work didn't quite translate to the screen , as conceived by its creator . What the film has going for itself is the interesting cast assembled for it . Never having been a fan of David Schwimmer , we have to admit he does a decent job because he is playing against type . Gwyneth Paltrow's take on Julie doesn't quite come across , but she always gives good readings in anything she appears . The surprise was Barbara Hershey , who as Mrs . Abernathy brings substance to a role that could have been a caricature with another , less experienced actress . The excellent supporting role is about the best thing in the movie . Michael Rappaport , a versatile actor , gives a fine performance as Tom's best friend . The amazing Carol Kane is never seen too long , but has a couple of funny scenes as Tom's mother . Tony Collette , as a brunette doesn't get to do much ; also in minor roles , Michael Vartan , Mark Margolies , Elizabeth Franz and the rest , contribute to the film .
554625	1406078	71206	6.0	The dog star of the 70s	Every decade , or so it seems , Hollywood likes to build films around a cute dog . The early seventies was the era for " Benji " , whose real name was Higgins , an attractive and photogenic dog that had already had a recurring role in " Petticoat Junction " , the successful sitcom of the sixties . Edgar Buchanan , one of the stars from that show is on hand to act with an old pal again . Joe Camp , the director and screen writer , targeted this film toward a young audience of children under ten . Higgins and his trainer , Frank Inn , do wonders for the film . " Benji " shows a dog that has a natural intelligence and responds well to whatever it was asked to do . The film will delight young children . Some other faces in the movie are Frances Bavier , Deborah Walley , Patsy Garrett and others . Although the movie is predictable , let's not forget it was targeted for a young audience that will probably appreciate it more than the grown ups .
555364	1406078	1124215	6.0	Size matters	In our society , being different can be a terrible experience , specially for a youngster who should be enjoying that stage of her life . Being overweight carries a stigma for insecure people . The cruelty of their peers can be devastating for a young person who finds rejection every way she turns . Take Maggie , a girl being raised by her working mother . Because of her size , she is made the butt of all jokes at the high school she attends . To make matters worse , as a prank , she is entered as a candidate for the Prom Queen , something that , as a rule , is reserved for those popular and cute girls whose popularity among the student body assures them of the title . Maggie proves to be an excellent contestant who proves that no matter what size she wears , she still a winner . The film wouldn't be half the fun it is had Nikki Blonsky not being cast as Maggie . As she had shown in " Hairspray " , Ms . Blonsky is a talented actress that one hopes will keep on being cast in movies that rely on her bubbly personality to carry the picture . Annie Potts , who we haven't seen in a while , shows up as Nikki's overworked mother . Peter Levin directed with style giving the viewer a nice excuse to watch " Queen Sized " .
554618	1406078	36719	6.0	I spy	Jean Negulesco's " The Conspirators " sounded intriguing when the trailer was shown at TCM . It appeared as though it was well worth a look because of the cast alone . Well , it was a big disappointment ! The story is convoluted , it is hardly plausible what the hero , Vincent , is able to pull , let alone , be allowed to enter Lisbon , at the crucial time when he arrives . The character of Irene remains an enigma throughout the film and finally , there is not enough to make this movie enjoyable . Paul Henried was a lucky man being in Hollywood while a lot of the American stars were away fighting in WWII . In this film he tries , but there's something about his Vincent that doesn't quite make it . Hedy Lamarr's presence in the movie is pretext to present her in different costumes . Henreid and Lamarr had not enough chemistry to make the film , at least , a nice love story . Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre are completely wasted and the rest of the players were not interesting enough to keep the viewer's attention at all times . Instead , one feels bored by the proceedings . At least Vincent and Irene , by the magic of the movies , will always have Lisbon !
556436	1406078	139462	6.0	A message from the past	Sometimes the adaptation of a best selling novel gets the right treatment for the screen , something that is not easy to do . " Message in a Bottle " , directed by Luis Mandoki , and with a plausible screenplay by Gerald DiPego , achieve the almost impossible in films of this genre , a credible story that , like in real life , doesn't turn out to be what one would might expect whenever Hollywood tackles projects such as translating this Nicholas Sparks novel for the movies . The best thing going for the film is the excellent cast that was put together for it . Robin Wright Penn is an amazing actress who goes from one appearance to the next lending her beautiful aura to whatever she is asked to play . She is an intelligent performer who gives her character , Theresa Osborne credibility and class . An inspired Kevin Costner is seen as Garrett Blake , the man who has suffered the loss of his beloved Catherine and having sent her a message in a bottle , can't believe the secret that Theresa has uncovered . The great Paul Newman , in one of his last roles , plays Garrett's father with his usual flair . It was always a pleasure to find this man in anything in the big screen . He clearly shows why he was simply one of the best players of his generation , bar none . He had the quality of saying so much with a minimum of gestures . It is almost as though he is not even acting because he is that man at that moment of his character's life . Even though he is no longer among us , he will live forever thanks to the medium in which he excelled .
556377	1406078	808237	6.0	Adrift in Acapulco	The mere idea that Mexican actors , Diego Luna and Gabriel Garcia Bernal were involved with " Drama / Mex " , was the main reason for watching this film written and directed by Gerardo Naranjo . This is , in many ways a movie that evokes better made ones by the likes of Alejandro Gonzales Inurritu , or Alfonso Cuaron , who have elevated the quality of Mexican cinema to new heights . " Drama / Mex " seems to have been a project of love on the part of everyone involved in it . The result feels like a cross between cinema-variete and a road picture , as we are taken along to meet a group of unconnected seedy characters that populate the lower depths of Acapulco . The film , with its two different narratives can be confusing at times if one doesn't pay attention of what is going on . What Mr . Naranjo has accomplished is to create an atmosphere of people in turmoil where he sets his characters to live and play . Best of all , Fernando Becerril , a solid actor who conveys the anguish Jaime is going through . This is a tormented soul and Mr . Becerril gives a nuanced performance . Among the young players , who might be non-professional , Diana Garcia , who is seen as Fernanda , shows a promise . Also Miriana Moro , as a young prostitute , and Emilio Valdes make valuable contributions . One can expect better things from Mr . Naranjo in the future .
555056	1406078	407342	6.0	On the run	Benoit Jacquot takes a real story from the 70s to base his film . " A tout de suite " photographed in black and white by Caroline Campeter , tries to capitalize on the mood and atmosphere of better made French movies of an earlier period . The young woman , Lili , at the center of the film , is a woman from a bourgeois home . Evidently , although nothing is made clear , her parents are divorced , or at least are separated . The big apartment where she lives with her father and sister seems to be the refuge for stray characters this girl feels attracted to . First , when we first encounter her , she is in bed with another young woman , who is a fellow student in her drawing class . There is a hint of lesbianism , although nothing is clear . Lili and the friend later meet a shady character who invites them to go dancing . In the boite , Lili meets Bada , a Moroccan , who she feels immediately attracted to . This chance meeting will prove to be Lili's downfall as she embarks in a partnership with a couple of bank robbers trying to escape justice in France . The film's best asset is Isild Le Besco , who as Lili makes the best of the central role . Ms . Le Besco is a beautiful woman who one sees in all her splendor . This is an actress who has no problems being naked in front of the camera that clearly adores her . Her character is a complex one . The other players , none of whom we are acquainted with , do their jobs well . Mr . Jacquot film has a feel of being a documentary in the way the action is presented . " A tout de suite " is only notable for the character study of Lili , but we don't feel involvement with the rest of the people we meet . It's a disturbing film that , judging from the empty theater where we saw it , doesn't seem to have caught the imagination of the public .
555470	1406078	110623	6.0	The Briggs of Cambridge	" Naked in New York " , is an indie film that is not seen much these days . In a way , its star , Eric Stolz is to be congratulated by his support to this kind of films . As directed by Daniel Algrent , and based on the material written by the director and John Warren , it shows it had a potential that somehow doesn't quite make the viewer root for these characters . At the center , Jake and Joanne . They seem to be an ideal couple . Not only are they attractive , but they appear to have their marriage under control , that is , until outside influences come their way and in a way try to derail it . Jake is an aspiring playwright and Joanne a photographer . Joanne makes it first when a gallery owner shows interest in her work and in her . Jake , helped by his college friend , Chris , gets one of his plays accepted for a Off-Broadway production . The separation of Jake from Joanne , plays heavily into their relationship . Jake suspects Elliott Price's motives when he makes Joanne his assistant . At the same time , Jake meets more than he bargained for in the theatrical world of New York , where he finds a fauna and flora he didn't count on . Eric Stolz and Mary Louise Parker make a good couple . Ralph Macchio is the gay friend who's secretly in love with Jake . Jill Clayburgh , Timothy Dalton and Tony Curtis are seen also . Kathleen Turner is excellent as the older theater diva who is instrumental in having Jake's play produced because she is in it . This was a good effort by all of the people involved .
556613	1406078	446687	7.0	There is nothing like a Dame !	Ben Marshall , a teen ager from a religious background , is made aware about the financial situation at home by his domineering mother Laura . She suggests him to find a temporary job in order to contribute to the household . In fact the family has taken a widower , to board with them . Robert Marshall , the father , is a pastor at the local church ; he'd much rather be in the country watching birds than tending to the souls entrusted to his church . The job Ben applies is with an older actress , Evie Walton , who wants him to do things for her around the house . " Dame " Evie , as she calls herself , is a woman of a certain age whose career has died maybe because she was not that great . In fact the only memorable appearance seems to be in a soap opera which was popular but she'd rather forget about it . Evie , who is a compulsive liar , tells Ben she's dying , only to forget it conveniently , later on when she comes clean to the boy . Ben is obviously in awe of the larger than life personality of his employer . He has been taking driving lessons . Evie asks him to take a camping trip , which he does against his better judgment . He knows that it will provoke his mother's fury . Not content with that , Evie decides to go on to Edinburgh , where she has been invited to read at an arts festival . It is this trip that solidifies their bond . Ben gets to meet and taste the pleasures of the flesh with a sympathetic Bryony . When Ben gets back , everything crumbles at home . His mother , who has been having an affair with a parishioner , decides to leave the family in favor of the young man she has been having an affair with . Ben and Evie's relationship survives the test of time . He also begins to see his own father in a different light . Jeremy Brock , the writer of " Driving Lessons " and other memorable English films , takes his first directorial job with this engaging comedy . The mixture of show business and religion , loyalty and friendship , are explored in his screen treatment making it a fun time at the movies . We have seen the similar situation before as in " Billy Elliott " , where Julie Walters plays a nurturing role with a younger man . We had read the film was based on Mr . Brock's own experience while working Dame Peggy Ashcroft when he was young . Julie Walters , who plays Evie Walton , is perhaps the best excuse to watch the movie . She always delivers . Ms . Walters is a welcome presence in any film she appears and she does wonders with her fake " dame " . Laura Linney , a luminous player herself , doesn't quite get our sympathy with her icy mother . Rupert Grint , famous for his Harry Potter's movies plays Ben , the young man who sees in Evie a kind soul . Nicholas Farrell is the betrayed father . Michelle Duncan has a small role in which she shines .
555613	1406078	290664	7.0	Jersey Girls	Mira Nair , the talented director of this film keeps surprising us . She gets excellent acting from the different casts in all her movies . " Hysterical Blindness " is no exception . Ms . Nair working on the screen play by Laura Cahill , and based on Ms . Cahill's own stage play , takes us to a town in New Jersey , so close to Manhattan in geography , but far away in the way these people seem to be living in another planet . Debby Miller blames her mother for whatever is wrong with her life . Her father left her when she was quite young . Her mother , Virginia , makes ends meet by working as a waitress in a local diner . Both daughter and mother have been cheated out of happiness because of the loss they have experienced . While Debby dwells on her unhappiness , Virginia seems to have adjusted quite well . Debby is a woman that is desperate to find a man . Obviously , she is quite capable to give her best into any relationship . It's sad how she goes after the one man she should have avoided in the worst way . It will be too late before she realizes the mistake she has made . Throughout the film , Debby and Beth , share their hopes and aspirations . While Beth is grounded , Debby is flighty , hoping for things she can't have . On the other hand , Virginia meets a nice man , Nick , at the diner . They begin a friendship that unfortunately is cut short by tragedy . All in all , the film final scenes tells us that Debby realizing her mistakes goes back to her roots and to her friendship with Beth . The strength in the movie is the great performances Ms . Nair gets out of the four principals . Uma Thurman is good as the Debby . Gena Rowlands , as the mother , makes an appealing Virginia , who makes us care about her . Juliette Lewis , as Beth , is also endearing . Ben Gazzara makes a short , but effective contribution as Nick , the man who finds love with Virginia . This is a film that shows Ms . Nair's talents perfectly .
554739	1406078	217787	7.0	Finding herself	Myra Paci's film was in many ways , a surprise because it came unexpectedly . For a young director , Ms . Paci , shows a lot of talent in the way she has constructed the film and in the performances she gets from her actors . The film presents the story of Gilda , a young woman getting over the death of her father . At the same time , it's revealed , accidentally , her father might have been involved with another woman . Her reaction is not typical , as she decides to go away to her grandparents in New York as a way to rebel against her mother . She also goes hoping to meet an actor who she has been obsessed with . Getting to know this man proves to be a let down for Gilda . This young woman feels betrayed by all the men she had loved and suddenly realizes where she belongs and returns home to make peace with her mother , who Gilda has blamed , in a way , for all that has gone wrong in her life . Susan May Pratt , is Gilda . Her performance seems effortless . Chris Noth is perfect as the egotistical Michael De Santis , the well known actor and the object of Gilda's love . Laila Robins , an extraordinary actress who works in the New York theatre extensively , brings an intelligent approach to Gilda's mother , who has also been betrayed by her husband . Mary Louise Wilson and Josef Sommer make brief appearances as Gilda's grandparents . Also , Michele Placido is seen as Giorgio .
554611	1406078	338337	7.0	Unemployment line	John Woo's casting for this film is what probably didn't make it work out . Ben Affleck , as an action hero registers nothing ! Maybe with another actor this movie would have fared better . Other than that , the film has a lot of elements from other films . We know from beginning to end how it's going to end . It's a shame that the story by Phillip K . Dick doesn't go anywhere . It was obvious a vehicle for its star . Aaron Eckhart fares much better than Ben Affleck . There is no chemistry between Uma Thurman and Affleck . The chase scenes at the end in the Seattle area are about the best things , but that too , has been done before . Watch it at your risk .
555080	1406078	451265	7.0	My kingdom for the woman I love !	As biopic films go , this one has taken a lot of liberties in order to produce an entertainment that will be appreciated by people that didn't know many of the details which surrounded the abdication of the heir of the English throne in the 1930s . Written by Sarah Williams and directed by without much excitement by Dave Moore , we are given an account of what went on behind the scenes in one of the most remarkable stories of the last century . Edward , who would have been the king of England after the death of his father , has to do some reckoning about whether to give up the reins to the empire in order to marry the woman who conquered his heart . This was one of the most romantic episodes involving a royal house in Europe in the last century . Duty , honor , something that is a natural for the monarchy of that country , was a burden Edward was not ready to accept because it excluded the twice-divorced Wallis Simpson , who he fell in love with and put him at odds with his family and the English establishment , something unheard of in those days . The result was his abdication and a life without his family , who protocol dictated to stay away from him after the scandal . Edward and Wallis lived the jet set life of the few privileged people of the times after he resigned the right to be crowned king . The film only deals with the events that led to that break . Joely Richardson shows an uncanny resemblance to Wallis Simpson , a woman with her own style who made headlines and who appeared to have lived a fulfilled life next to the man who gave up everything for her . Stephen Campbell Moore is seen as Edward . Mr . Campbell Moore makes a good impression as this somewhat rash young man who couldn't care anything about the power his position would have meant for him . He was an unselfish man who threw everything away for love . Mr . Moore got interesting performances from the supporting cast , especially Richard Johnson , as Stanley Baldwin , the man who opposed the marriage from the start . David Calder is seen as Winston Churchill , who proved to be a true friend to the troubled monarch . The excellent Margaret Tyzak , who has little to do , appears as a proud Queen Mary . This film , although far from accurate , shows a page of history from the not too distant past in which we are shown a different situation of the royal family of England , something that in today's standards wouldn't have occurred at all .
554656	1406078	312549	7.0	All the news fit to print	Joel Schumacher seems a strange choice for directing the film , before actually taking a look at the finished product . While the logical choice might have been someone like Neil Jordan , Mr . Schumacher makes the most of it with the material at hand . As usual , he is a director that likes to take chances , as he shows here . This film came and went without being noticed in this country . Some movies go away quickly , which was the case with " Vernica Guerin " . Having just seen it in DVD format , it deserved much better than oblivion from the distributing studio , or the many people deprived of seeing it when it first was released . Veronica Guerin was a courageous woman who was not afraid for her life , even though there are a couple of instances that could have caused her death , before her actual demise . We see the events on a flashback , as the movie starts with the tragic events of Ms . Guerin's death . We watch her pursuing the people that had no scruples unloading drugs in impoverish areas of Ireland and laughing all the way to the bank with the millions they made illegally . Cate Blanchett does a great job in her portrayal of Ms . Guerin . Not knowing what the real person was like , Ms . Blanchett bears an uncanny resemblance to the real woman . Cieran Hands , as John , the informer , is also quite good . Having seen him on the stage , he does an excellent turn as this evil man . Finally , Gerard McSorley is also what one would expect his John Gilligan to be ; he makes Gilligan appear as the vermin he was . Brenda Fricker , as Veronica's mother , has only a few dignified moments on camera . The rest of the Irish actors were extremely good in contributing to create the right atmosphere for the movie . This movie emphasizes the danger of drugs and the unscrupulous people that get rich out of the misery of others .
555780	1406078	210070	7.0	Two sisters and werewolves	John Fawcett , the director of " Ginger Snaps " , presents a horror film that shows a lot of originality . Instead of falling into the clichés of the genre , he avoids all the worst of this type of movies by creating an surreal world that scares the viewer in ways no other film in recent memory does . The tight screen play by Mr . Fawcett and Karen Walton works well on the screen . Best of all , and the main reason for watching " Ginger Snaps " is the work of the two principals , Emily Perkins and Katharine Isabelle , who play Brigitte and Ginger , respectively . Both actress add a lot to the film . There's never a false move from either one of these young actresses , who are clearly on their way to do bigger and better things , as they demonstrate in the film . The film has enough gore for this , and another film . The werewolves have a field day at the lonely fort where most of the action takes place . " Ginger Snaps " is recommended for a mature audience since there are some graphic scenes that will stay forever with younger , and more impressionable minds . Highly recommended for fans of horror movies !
556059	1406078	47956	7.0	Those airmen in their flying machines	Otto Preminger was perhaps honing his skills as a director , because this film seems to be a dress rehearsal for his greatest achievement , " Anatomy of a Murder " , which is a classic of the courtroom drama genre . The movie is interesting in that it presents a man of honor , Billy Mitchell , who not only was an aviation pioneer , but a visionary that pointed out to the future in uncanny ways . He realized that wars were going to be fought in the air , and that soon the world would shrink thanks to faster planes than the primitive two engine jobs he was flying during WWI . Billy Mitchell was an outcast , rejected by the same people that were too obtuse to realize the upcoming revolution in aeronautics . In trying to prove a point , Billy is found guilty and tried for disobeying orders . It's a sad story in which a highly developed mind , like Billy's has to contend with the ignorance of his peers . Testimony from other leading figures of the time , such as Eddie Rickenbacker , and others speak volumes about Mitchell's incredible insight on the new technology and how vulnerable America was from air raids by enemies . Gary Cooper's approach to the role doesn't clarify much about the real life Mitchell . He is not quite as effective as in many of his most outstanding films . Somehow we don't get any passion out of his character , where perhaps another actor would have run away with the role . Mr . Cooper's take on Mitchell , or perhaps Otto Preminger's direction , doesn't shed much insight in the character . The best thing in the movie is Rod Steiger as Allan Gullion , who is brought to the trial to help the main prosecution officer . He steals the picture in his short time in front of the camera . Mr Steiger brings a different concept to this officer ; he stands out against all the other people around him . What a presence he had ! In contrast with Mr . Cooper's stoic presence , Mr . Steiger was ready to smolder the screen if given the chance . The rest of the cast is outstanding . Charles Bickford , Ralph Bellamy , Elizabeth Montgomery , Jack Lord , James Daly , Fred Clark , among others , enhance this movie . The only problem with the copy I saw , is the horrible coloring that tends to give a fading images . This is a film in need of restoration .
555355	1406078	248190	7.0	The monster speaks !	Hal Hartley is an original film maker . With this film , which I recently saw in DVD form , he presents us a modern day parable about the media an its influence on our lives . It's curious to see how ahead of his times Mr . Hartley is when he deals with paranoia , even before the attacks of , in his own subtle way . It was not intentional , I'm sure , but he proves to have a keen eye for what was coming . The film is not one of Mr . Hartley's best , but we see his sure hand behind all what he is trying to do here . He is working with a cast that is working with him for the first time , with the exception of Robert John Burke , the Monster . Sarah Polley , is one of the best actresses working in movies these days . Her Beatrice is a study in contrasts . Also excellent , as always , is Helen Mirren , Beatrice's boss who is ruthless , arrogant , and manipulative . She knows the secret of how to get attention in the worst possible ways . Julie Christie makes a rare appearance as a kind doctor who befriends Beatrice . The scenery in Iceland is magnificent and Mr . Hartley captures it brilliantly .
554691	1406078	155722	7.0	Shoot the piano player !	Rolf Schubel , the director , has created a movie around a menage a trois that was very civilized . Ilona loves Joachim , but she also loves Andras , the piano player . Andras , is the composer of the suicide provoking song that was the rage of the 30s in Budapest , as well as in the rest of Europe . The setting is a somehow fancy restaurant in Budapest at the onset of World War II . Laszlo , the owner , is having an affair with Ilona , his assistant , who also works at the restaurant . Enter Andras : Ilona is instantly smitten by his good looks , his obvious youth , in contrast with Joachim , who is much older but might not be exactly what she wants to find between her sheets . Joachim goes along with the very civilized arrangement among them . One night is spent with Andras and the next one with Laszlo , who after all , is the one with the money and paying the bill ! Of course , the story is too good to be true . There is Hans , the young German that adores the fine cousine offered at the restaurant and is taken with Ilona's beauty . Hans will return as a Nazi officer and he'll be the force that destroys the happiness of this trio and who , at the end , has to pay for the horrible things he did in his youth . This part was very predictable , since one knows after seeing so many stories like this , it always ends tragically because of Nazis , even friendly ones , as Hans was , deep down inside hates Joachim because he had what he never could have , Ilona . Therefore , Joachim will have to disappear from the picture . The film is easy to watch . The melody will stay with the viewer forever , but alas , like a good Hungarian dishes , too much paprika will spoil the goulash .
556342	1406078	278500	7.0	The Importance of being Oscar	One wonders if the play where this film is based could have been played by an all male cast in drag since the material lends itself to it . Director Oliver Parker's approach to the the story is so heavy handed that there's actually no fun in what's going on . The end result is just plain silly . The actors in the film are attractive , but the story , as presented on the screen , is just so boring , that instead of amusing , it induces the spectator to fall asleep , as witnessed by this writer , on a screening at the Angelika in New York , a few weeks ago . Having seen the play a few times on stage in London , this version pales in comparison to the worst staging of the work . One wonders what Mr . Wilde would have thought of the film . Maybe he would have decided to re-write it with an all male cast in it , writing a much lighter screenplay a bit more " gayer " and this would have been an occasion for everybody to go enjoy it .
554803	1406078	102343	7.0	Love potion # 8	Imagine if there ever was a strong potion that would make plain , unattractive people into glamorous ones . That's what happens to Paul Matthews , a nerdy scientist , who doesn't have much luck in the love department . When he decides to visit Madame Ruth , she tells him he is a lost case , but with the help of one of her magical preparations , he will be a winner . Well , Paul , a man of science , knows better , and never takes the seer's advice . His cat , on the other hand , discovers the magical powers when it licks the preparation that Paul threw in the garbage can . Diane Farrows , another scientist , sticks out like a sore thumb when we see her with some friends at a restaurant . She is a shy woman who has a car problem . She is in danger of losing her insurance as the traffic cop keeps writing her up for speeding . When Paul tells her about his discovery , she decides to experiment with one of the monkeys in her lab . Little prepares her for the results . Diane takes matters into her own hands and suddenly she is a popular girl who even attracts Prince Geoffrey , a hunk , who falls for the new woman . Dale Launer , a screen writer with a lot of hits , directs this mildly funny comedy we never had seen before , but which turns out to be a harmless way to spend an evening . Mr . Launer knows what he wants and he goes after it . He was lucky in casting the two talented principals in roles that with other actors might not have been as funny . Sandra Bullock appeared in this film before she made a splash in " Speed " and " While You Were Sleeping " . She plays the nerdy scientist with great panache . She goes a total transformation and we see her beauty that was hidden inside of what looked a homely girl . Tate Donovan also does good work as the nerdy Paul . Anne Bancroft is seen as the gypsy woman who can see the future . The rest of the cast do excellent work for Mr . Launer . Watch the film the next time it is shown on cable and let it work its magic on you . Mr . Launer knows how to write comedy , as he clearly proves it with this movie , once again .
556448	1406078	236285	7.0	For the love of Marianela	This biopic about the great Cuban trumpet player Arturo Sandoval was probably made because of its star , Andy Garcia's interest in music from his homeland . Otherwise , this HBO film probably wouldn't have made it into a commercial vehicle . As directed by Joseph Sargent , the film is mildly pleasant to watch . Not having been an Andy Garcia fan , one must say , that he gives a convincing performance as Arturo , the man at the center of the action . His love for the gorgeous Marianela , played also with gusto by the gorgeous Mia Maestro , seems to have been what propelled him into seeking a new life in the United States . At times , the film doesn't make much political sense . Arturo Sandoval was able to tour the world under the Castro regime without taking the stand he makes at the end . Of course , everything is conveniently explained about how if he wouldn't have toed the line , he wouldn't have even played , let alone go abroad , for fear he would defect . The fear of not being able to be reunited with his wife and son is what keeps him from making a clean break , or so it seems . Of course , one realizes this is a fictionalized account of Mr . Sandoval's life made to please a wide audience . Mr . Sandoval's friendship with Dizzy Gillespie gets a lot of attention , yet , one wonders if that was the case . The incident where Mr . Sandoval takes Mr . Gillespie in his jalopy to meet the great Chano Pozo , is a figment of the film makers imagination . At the same time , no one seemed to know who Chano Pozo , perhaps one of the best Cuban musicians of all time , was ! Also questionable is the fact that Mr . Sandoval's relationship with Paquito D'Rivera was what it's made to be in the film . Mr . D'Rivera shows a lot more courage by defecting at the first opportunity even though his own family would be penalized and stayed behind for many years , punished by the totalitarian regime in that unhappy island . As biopics go , this film is somewhat enjoyable , but it remains a work of fiction .
555950	1406078	395296	7.0	A crime in the mountains	Director Manuel Gutierrez Aragon presents a rural drama that takes place in the mountains of Cantabria , in Northern Spain . This film , part of the annual presentation of Spanish cinema , is a picture with a lot of ambition . Were it not for this festival , Spanish films , such as this one , would not have been seen in this city because this type of cinema is not commercial and there is no market for it . On the one hand , the movie shows the hard life these peasants lead in a remote and desolate region . Also , the director wants to make a statement about how progress in the country , being now part of the European Community , penalizes the small farmers that have eked a life from their cows and agriculture for ages . If you haven't seen the film , please stop reading now . The new developments in the country wreak havoc for Gildo , and his neighbor Severo . Both men are the victims of a system that condemns them both for producing more milk than it's allowed by the ECU . They don't see eye to eye ; there is resentment and bad blood between them . When Gildo sends a young calf to his neighbor , Severo takes offense , taking his daughter Val prisoner , against her will , for nothing this young woman has done . There is confrontation between Severo , Val and Gildo , in which the first one dies . This brings Rai , the estranged son of Severo back to the funeral and to put his father's things in order before returning to the small town , where he works as a hair dresser . Rai falls for Val , but the fact remains that this son , as well as the rest of the town , feels that Celso killed Severo . Rai falls hard for Val . Their romance goes against Gildo's wishes who feels the young man will see who the real culprit is . The movie is more approachable than some of the other movies of this director , who can please an audience , as well as repulse the viewer . Juan Diego is Gildo , who is totally convincing as Gildo . The young actress Marta Etura , is Val , the daughter who must work with the father to make a go of their meager existence . Ms . Etura bears an uncanny resemblance to Holly Hunter . Luis Tosar is Rai , who gives a controlled performance . The views of the hills of Cantabria is breathtaking . The green mountains come alive in this movie . Mr . Gutierrez Aragon gives us a slice of life among these peasants whose lives have not changed for centuries .
555163	1406078	49055	7.0	Merry go round	" Carousel " , the musical , was presented on Broadway with great success . The transition to the screen , alas , doesn't fare that well . Having seen this film version a while ago , we decided to take a second look , but this time , in all honesty , it didn't have the same effect . Partly , it must be Henry King's take on the musical . Perhaps it this Rodgers and Hammerstein hasn't aged that well . The problem , perhaps , seems to be in the music . We have heard variations of these Rodgers and Hammerstein's songs in other musicals . Take for instance , " You'll Never Walk Alone " , doesn't it sound suspiciously like " Climb Every Mountain " from " The Sound of Music " ? In both cases , they are heard from much older and wiser women , Cousin Nettie , in this one , or Mother Superior in the other . Also there are shades of " Some Enchanting Evening " , from " South Pacific " , while Louise is seen playing around at the beach while Billy is looking from heaven . Of course , we realize " Carousel " came before . One wonders what change of events took Billy Bigelow to heaven ? After all , he wasn't a model of righteousness , let alone his way of giving Julie a slap or two at times . If all indicates that he was admitted through the Pearly Gates of heaven , then , there's a chance for most of us , or so , it seems to be the case . Gordon McRae was more of a singer than an actor , and it sadly shows in this film . The lovely Shirley Jones , at the prime of her youth , fares much better because she could not only sing , but she was a notable actress of this genre and comedy . For some reason , the chemistry that might have existed between them in " Oklahoma " , is not shown here . Cameron Mitchell , Gene Lockhart , Claramae Turner , Susan Luckey , among others do good supporting jobs in the film . The choreography of Agnes de Mille is only seen in all its splendor in " June is busting out all over " and in the Carousel ballet , somehow abridged , and featuring Jacques D'Amboise with Louis Luckey in one of the best moments of the musical .
554630	1406078	304678	7.0	On location	Catherine Brreillat is a French director who loves to provoke her audience . She takes us along to witness how a film is done on location . The movie in production seems to be based on herself , since the person at the center of the story is Jeanne , a woman director , much like Ms . Breillat . Jeanne acts as the alter ego of the real director . Jeanne reaches an impasse at the start of filming . Not only has she picked the wrong time to photograph this movie during a cold spell , as it involves beach locations that are obviously too cold for the actors and extras . Jeanne has problems with the two principal actors , especially , the male lead who has problems accepting the way the director has decided to show him in the movie ; the lead actress is no angel either . Movie making , Ms . Breillat tells us is a process like no other in a creative work of art . First , there is the writing period , in which , in this case , Jeanne , has written a screen play , that when it goes into production reveals problems the writer / director didn't think about . There is the problem of how she wants to photograph a love scene in which the young woman of the story has her first sex contact . What appeared clever in the written page , doesn't necessarily translate into an easy time in front of the camera . The actor is made to wear a false penis and has a lot of problems accepting the fact that a make up has to touch him in ways he never thought he would ever be touched by another man . The luminous Anne Parillaud is marvelous as Jeanne , the director . She makes observations about the production , the actors , and the crew that fit well into the story being told . Gregoire Colin and Roxane Mesquide play the lead actors , with all the insecurity that some actors bring to a movie set . Jeanne has to massage their egos in order to get what she wants in the end . Ashley Waninnger plays Leo , Jeanne's assistant . " Sex Is Comedy " allows Ms . Breillet to give us her own take on films in general . This is a great look at the way movies are done in a typical Breillat style .
556434	1406078	320042	7.0	The escape artist	The plight of an Argentine family is examined in this film . At the time of the military dictatorship , they must hide and get new identities because the imminent danger of being never seen again by their loved ones . This family whose names are never revealed , try to continue their lives as best they can , hoping their hideaway is never discovered . In Spain , as well as in Argentina , most of the films deal with a difficult period of their history that movie makers love to bring to the screen . Thus , the Spanish Civil War , has been explored by the Spaniards , and in Argentina , we have been given films that also show the horrors some people lived during the 1970s when chaos reigned in the country . Kamchatka suffers from being obscure . The story is easy to follow , but audiences not familiar with that period of time , will be at a loss , as many comments submitted to this forum clearly indicate . Marcelo Pineyro , is a director / writer with experience in this subject , having been instrumental in the more superior " La historia oficial " . Working with Marcelo Figueras , they have produced a film that , while engrossing , leaves a lot of things unexplained . The best thing in the film is Matias Del Pozo , who probably was not a professional actor , but who steals the film from the more experienced actors like Cecilia Roth and Ricardo Darin , two giants in the Argentine cinema . As the boy who loves to read about Harry Houdini's exploits , he is marvelous to watch , and a natural at that . Ms . Roth has good moments , as well as Mr . Darin , but their efforts are dwarfed by what they have been given to play . We have enjoyed Mr . Pineyro's work and will be looking forward to his next films .
554885	1406078	222850	7.0	The boys in the Santa Monica softball team	We watched this film when it first was released . On second viewing , thanks to the IFC channel , " The Broken Hearts Club " looks a bit dated since more daring films and television series have come out of the closet recently . It must have been a courageous undertaking by its director , Greg Berlanti , in 2000 , at a time that gays were not as prominent as now . The director shows a positive side of the gay life that is not seen often , in that all the characters have values and integrity , something not often seen in mainstream films . The film is an excuse to bring together a group of young men trying to cope with their lives in that environment . There are different stories that mesh well together . At the center of it all is Dennis , a photographer that seems to have his feet well planted on the ground and knows what he wants . The friends are united by Jack , the restaurant owner , who has taken most of the guys under his wing , at his bistro and as a coach them in the softball team . We watch the different situations and how the guys react to whatever comes their way . The acting is good , in general . Timothy Olyphant makes an impression as the serious Dennis . Zach Braff , a film director , himself is good as Benji . Dean Cain is the fickle Cole , who loves a variety of lovers , rather than quality mates . John Mahoney appears as Jack , the older influence on the group in an impressive performance . What director Greg Berlanti succeeded was in presenting young men that appear not to be clichés as in other films of this type . The film is pleasant without breaking new ground .
556524	1406078	86450	7.0	Hamming Hamlet	" To be , or not to be " , in this version , while taking the basic idea from the classic by Ernst Lubitsch , is not a copy , but a variation on an idea . Under the direction of Alan Johnson , the film is worth a look because of all the people that were gathered to make a contribution . Who knows what Mel Brooks might have been able to do with this movie , but since he's only acting in it , his hands appear to be tied . The idea of Mr . Brooks as a popular theater actor offers possibilities . His wife , Anna , brilliantly played by ( Anne Bancroft ) gives us a chance to observe this wonderful couple at the top of their form . Some familiar faces are also seen . Tim Matheson , makes a great ace pilot , secretly in love with Anna . Charles Durning does an excellent portrayal of the Nazi Colonel Ehrhardt . Jose Ferrer is seen in the pivotal role of a traitor . Probably the best scenes involve Mr . Brooks and Ms . Bancroft singing and dancing . Also , Mr . Brooks makes an incredible take off on Hamlet and as Hitler . While the film is not all what one expects , it's gives us an excuse for watching it and still have a good time while at it .
555412	1406078	120861	7.0	The aviator	Imagine the plight of Richard , a painter , whose real passion is flying . When we first meet him , he is seen atop a building in London wearing his home made wings . He has ripped his canvases and other works , at the height of his despair , and fashions a flying device for his jump . When he falls into the protective police contraption , he doesn't suffer a scratch , but it lands him in front of a judge who orders him to do community service . Richard , whose relationship with Anne apparently ended badly , decides to relocate to a rural area where he finds a place in the country with a large barn he plans to use to construct his own plane . Richard ends up trying to help Jane Harchard reluctantly . She is a young woman suffering from A . L . S . , or Lou Gehrig's disease and is confined to a motorized wheel chair . Jane is extremely intelligent , but has a dark side and a salty vocabulary . She uses a hand held device to speak sometimes , as her speech is not clear . What Jane loves to do is to lose her virginity , at any cost . Jane and Richard clash as they meet , but a mutual tolerance soon makes them comfortable with one another . Jane , who watches porn on her computer , has a notion for finding someone like Richard Gere in " American Gigolo " , who will , for a fee , have sex with her . When Richard takes her to London , they find the right man for the job . His fee is exorbitant , but they agree . Since they have no money , Richard decides to rob a big bank . Unfortunately , things don't go according to plan when Jane realizes that she can't go through with what she had wanted . At the end , Richard takes Jane for a ride in his crudely built plane for the thrill of her life , something that brings them closer , as they find an affinity with one another . Peter Greengrass directed this quirky film which presents an unusual situation . Jane is clearly not the romantic heroine in mainstream films , and yet , she has such a sweet aura about her that is hard not to feel for her and what she is trying to accomplish . Mr . Greengrass shows an affinity Richar Hawkins ' material he wrote for the film . The movie doesn't try to be cute or give a rosy picture of a young woman afflicted with an incurable disease . Helena Bonham Carter is the main reason for watching the film . She makes a wonderful Jane . On the other hand , Kenneth Branagh doesn't seem too well suited for this type of comedy . Somehow , he has problems of his own in the way he interprets Richard . Gemma Jones has some good moments as Anne , Richard's former love . " The Theory of Flight " shows a good director . No doubt Peter Greengrass will go to bigger and better things .
556614	1406078	188128	7.0	The baker's daughter	The life of Annie Mary changes completely after the death of her mother . Annie Mary , who had a beautiful voice , suddenly stopped trying to sing opera . Her life in the small Welsh town is boring , to say the least . To make matters worse , her best friend , Bethan Bevan , is struck by cancer . Annie Mary , who is a loyal friend , wants to help her sick friend go to Disneyland . Annie Mary's father , Jack , has a bakery in the town . We see him as he makes his deliveries in a Luciano Pavarotti's mask and singing in his beautiful tenor opera arias that are much admired by the people of the area . When he suffers a stroke , Annie Mary's life goes into a tail spin . As a caretaker , Annie Mary is useless . As much as she tries to make a go at being a baker , she never makes it work . In desperation she turns to Mrs . Madoc , her father's girlfriend , to buy her out . As a way to help Bethan , Annie Mary and a few of the town's women , she decides to enter a contest in Cardiff . They have prepared to do a number of the Village People , " Y . M . C . A . " , but they are horrified when they arrive at the hall where the competition is going to be held , and watch a group of men doing exactly their number , much better . The women decide to change their act into a sort of " Three Tenors " aria in which Annie Mary , wearing an inflated rubber suit , floats into the audience . Needless to say , they win , but emboldened by the turn of events in her life , she gambles all the money into a horse race and loses it . Annie Mary becomes Ogw's most hated person . What's more the trip to Disneyland is too late for Bethan , who suffers a relapse . It's at this point that Annie Mary finds her voice again and she gives her friend a rendition of Puccini's aria " O mio bambino caro " in a shaky voice that gets better as the scene changes to another location . Sara Sugarman , the writer and director of this screwball comedy was lucky in casting one of the most talented actresses working in films these days : Rachel Griffiths . Ms . Sugarman gets a tremendous performance out of Ms . Griffiths , who shows her range in a role she was born to play . Jonathan Pryce is also excellent as the distant father who can't see eye to eye with his daughter . Although sometimes the accents get a bit hard to follow , the luminous presence of Ms . Griffiths and the sure direction of Ms . Sugarman make us overlook that minor problem and enjoy the comedy .
554589	1406078	178642	7.0	A quest for getting answers about a sister's mysterious death	Jennifer Egan's novel was brought to the screen by Canadian director Adam Brooks in a film that , based on some comments from contributors to this forum , sounds a bad proposition , but in fact , it's much better than one is led to believe . This is a story about two sisters who loved one another dearly . Faith , the fair headed and happy-go-lucky hippie girl , takes her younger sibling , Phoebe , under her wing . Phoebe plainly loves Faith ; when the older one decides to follow her boyfriend Wolf to Europe on a summer vacation from Berkley , she promises she will send Phoebe a post card every day . Faith does that , until the cards stop coming in and one night , some time later , the family receives a phone call to inform them Faith has died under tragic circumstances . Phoebe can't forget Faith . That is why after some years pass by , she decides to take the same route the older sister took . She takes the cards from Faith and visits each place , starting in Amsterdam , then moving on to Paris and she wants to end up the trip in Portugal , where Faith encountered her untimely death . In Paris , Phoebe hooks up with Wolf , who by now , is not a hippie anymore and is living with his girlfriend . Wolf , tries to persuade Phoebe into abandoning her trip and to go back home ; she suspects that Wolf holds the key into solving the mystery , and as she is going to depart for Portugal she makes a discovery when she finds a picture that clearly contradicts Wolf's version he has told Phoebe . He feels guilty and , against his girlfriend's wishes , decides to accompany Phoebe to the town where Faith died . The story changes at this point and we go back in flashbacks to what Faith experienced in Europe and what happened in her final days . The best thing in " The Invisible Circus " are the performances of the principals , something that Mr . Brooks has to take the credit for . The big surprise is the range of Cameron Diaz , who , as Faith , seems to select light comedy parts , when she is quite able to do good dramatic work under the right director . Jordana Brewster is seen as the older Phoebe and makes a wonderful contribution to the film . She is a stunning beauty with what seems to be a naturalness for acting . Christopher Eccleston is Wolf and shows he also is capable of doing more serious drama . The sweet Camilla Belle plays the younger Phoebe quite convincingly . Blythe Danner appears as the mother of the girls . The European locations are gloriously photographed by Henry Braham . The film is also enhanced by the musical score of Nick Laird-Clowes and Petra Haden's original song . Elizabeth Kling edited with great elegance . Ultimately , this film shows Adam Brooks in great form as he gives the right tone to the adaptation of the novel and gets rewarded by having the right cast doing wonders for him .
555132	1406078	377062	7.0	From the ashes	This remake of the more successful 1965 film of the same title was shown on cable recently . We were curious as to how the great screen play by Lukas Heller had been adapted by Scott Frank . The film , directed by John Moore , has taken the action from the Sahara to the Gobi desert . The result is a thriller that has some good moments , but in the end , doesn't improve in the better made earlier film . The scene for this new version takes us to a remote spot in Mongolia where a woman engineer , Kelly , and her crew , are evacuated because the company she works for decides there is no oil to be found in that remote spot . Next , we watch as an aircraft piloted by Frank Towns , arrives to take everybody to Shanghai , China . A mysterious man , Elliott , who doesn't have anything to do with the oil company , comes along for the flight to China . On the way , the plane suffers an accident caused by the terrible sand storm affecting the region . They land on the desert with only minor casualties . The aircraft seems to be out of commission , but Elliott , who tells the stranded passengers that the plane could be rebuilt , gets to act as the leader of the whole operation . In fact , he is an engineer who knows how to do it . Since they have the proper tools they begin to transform the wrecked cargo plane into something that resembles a toy model , which Elliott promises will fly . Little prepares us for what really turns out to be Elliott's real job . The film has some moments , but the direction doesn't take it anywhere . The cast does what it can with the material they have been given . Dennis Quaid , Giovanni Ribisi , are seen as Capt . Towns and Elliott . Miranda Otto , a good actress , plays Kelly , who didn't exist in the early version . Seen as a curiosity , it will entertain , but for a better take on the same subject , a look at the former version will be more satisfying .
556532	1406078	376961	7.0	Mergers and acquisitions	The title in English for this film is " Work Hard , Play Hard " , which is the slogan for the McGregor group , the company at the center of the story . Of course , it bears no resemblance with the original French title that perhaps makes more sense . This film deals with the realities of what is happening in the work place today . It's sort of a universal phenomenon in which the fate of people that have given their lives working for a company , suddenly , face an uncertain future . A few of them will end unemployed because these workers are expendable . Director Jean Marc Moutout presents us with the intrigues within a successful company . Philippe Seigner , a young and talented would-be executive type , is hand picked by his immediate superior , not because of his credentials , but because the boss thinks he can carry out the hatchet job without any qualms . Since Laurent has no scruples , he expects nothing else from his subordinate . Philippe meets and falls in love with the single mother , Eva , who sees in the young man someone she can love . Alas , Philippe will surprise her with an unusual turn of events that will separate the two lovers forever . The acting is first rate . Jeremie Renier seems to be a natural actor . Cylia Malki and Laurent Lucas , are quite good , as is the rest of an ensemble cast under the sure direction of M . Moutout .
555307	1406078	361620	7.0	The President's daughter	The main interest in watching " First Daughter " was to see this directing effort by Forest Whitaker , an original actor , who also was at the helm of " Hope Floats " and " Waiting to Exhale " , previously . Mr . Whitaker seems to be having great fun with this project , which centers around the daughter of an incumbent President of the USA that is starting college . The premise lends itself for a lot of unusual situations . Also , the fact that Katie Holmes was playing the principal role was a deciding factor . Ms . Holmes is one of the most versatile young actresses working in films these days , as she has shown in other films . The result is a film that falls somehow into the formula type of movie because it doesn't show anything new , but it's a pleasant way to spend an hour and forty minutes in good company . It won't bore the viewer and there are moments when some sparks of originality from the director can be seen . The only thing we would question is the way Mr . Whitaker and his choreographer , Miranda Garrison , staged the two dancing numbers , first between Samantha and James , then between the President and his daughter . It's the same number , but there is no spontaneity in it . In fact , in both occasions they seem to be following a programmed dance , rather than just dancing for the joy of it . Katie Holmes does a good job as Samantha . Marc Blucas is James , her love interest . Michael Keaton , looking rather old , ( maybe is the makeup to make him look an older statesman ) and Margaret Colin play the first couple and Amerie Rogers is Mia , Samnatha's funny roommate .
556272	1406078	368913	8.0	Freedom cry	Director Siddiq Barmak demonstrates with this film the meaning of freedom . It is the best possible argument for the need to speak the truth about what happened in Afghanistan during the Taliban regime . It is also a first hand view of the atrocities that were committed against Afghani women , most of them defenseless , most of them widowed , whose men died either during the Russian conflict , or at the hands of the repressive Taliban , who in the name of God , killed thousands of innocent people in that war torn country . The incredible thing about this film is that it was done for less than $25 , 000 . It is a miracle what Mr . Barmak has done with this film that uses non professional actors as the main characters . The pivotal role of Osama , the young girl who is made to look like a boy in order to bring food to her widowed mother , and grandmother , is played convincingly by Marina Golbhari . Taking into consideration that she was a beggar from the streets of Kabul , this young woman registers in her beautiful face the horrors she encounters along the way . Unfortunately , she is doomed from the very beginning into a life of a second class citizen where she has to wear that horrible garment over her face at all times because otherwise , as a woman , under that oppressive regime , she could be killed , for only showing her face ! In retrospect , the Taliban , or extremist religious people in that part of the world have it wrong . It is the men that should cover their faces at all times ! The women , with their exotic , dark beauty should let everyone look at them for what they are : gorgeous people that must hide behind a veil .
555647	1406078	39041	8.0	War casualty	" Tomorrow is Forever " is a typical example of the type of films that came out of the Hollywood of the 40s . This seems to have been brought to the screen as a vehicle for Claudette Colbert , one of the most admired actresses of that era . Under the direction of Irving Pichel , we get a wonderful account of a woman whose husband is killed during the last days of WWI . The music score by Max Steiner enhances the film , although it feels obtrusive , at times . Claudette Colbert was a prolific star of all the melodramas that were tailor made for her to shine . Her Elizabeth Hamilton in this film is a typical role she , and other actresses , played during that era . " Tomorrow is Forever " is interesting because of Orson Welles ' appearance as the supposedly dead husband that returns under a different disguise . Today's audiences don't have patience to deal with what for the movie going public in the early days were able to allow in the reality department . Some negative comments to this forum express that viewpoint , but in spite of them , films like this will always be immensely rewarding for those fans that feel comfortable with the plots created for this type of movies . Claudette Colbert makes a wonderful Elizabeth . Orson Welles was the real surprise in the dramatic role that Ms . Colbert championed for him , at a time of his life that he wasn't recognized for his genius . George Brent , a reliable actor , is seen as one of the decent men he played in films . Lucile Watson , as Aunt Jessie , is an asset . The young Richard Long plays Drew , the eldest son that has no clue who his father really is , but grows up believing the kind Lawrence is his dad . Natalie Wood as the young German girl , Margaret , showed a talent for stealing scenes from much established actors . This is a film to be cherished by people who love the genre .
554752	1406078	352248	8.0	The Braddock family in the Great Depresion	Ron Howard's latest film " Cinderella Man " probably miscalculated its release date . Being a serious film about a real incident in a not too glamorous era , the movie arrives in the middle of the summer releases that seem to be made for action packed adventures or thrillers that don't require much of the viewer . That said , " Cinderella Man " presents a vivid portrait of one of the worst times in American history : The Great Depression . At the center of the story is James Bradock , a fighter that is seen at the beginning of the film with what appears an assured future . Then , the bad times that affected the country have a profound effect in the Braddock family . From living with a certain degree of comfort , they are relegated to eke out a living in order to survive . James Braddock's work in the New Jersey's piers becomes scarce , as only a few men are employed at a time . Early on , in a fight , Jimmy breaks a hand that puts him to a disadvantage among the men working at hauling cargo in and out of ships . Fortunately , Mike Wilson , a decent man , also impoverished by the situation , gives him a hand whenever they are teamed together . This will be a friendship that will last forever . At home , things go from bad to worse . Mae Braddock , the wife and mother of three children , tries to make do with whatever little she can lay her hands in . It's heart wrenching to watch her try to put food on the table , let alone something that might have any nourishment . Jimmy Braddock has to resort to get public assistance and even to beg from the people that congregate at a Madison Square Garden club . James Braddock's true friend turns out to be Joe Gould , who would guide him back to a phenomenal comeback that establishes him as one of the great fighters of the times . Jim Braddock goes to fight the powerful Max Baer , a man that has been notorious for killing a couple of opponents in the ring . The film is satisfying in spite of all the desolation and poverty one sees . Of course , it's evident we either never went through those bad times of the 30s , or have never been in Mr . Braddock's family position . In spite of all that is against them , the family made out well and even went to prosper , which says a lot for them . Above all , Mr . Braddock teaches us a lesson in how to keep his family united in spite of the rough times they were facing . As James Braddock , Russell Crowe makes a fabulous contribution . He transforms himself into the fighter that has to face poverty in order to appreciate what came afterward as a reward . Renee Zellwegger is fine as the suffering Mae . Paul Giamatti makes a tremendous appearance as Joe Gould . Paddy Considine plays Mike Wilson , the man who helped Braddock resume his work in the docks by carrying an extra weight when his friend was obviously in pain . The screen play by Cliff Hollinger and Akiva Goldsman takes an intelligent account of the era . Finally , Ron Howard scores a real winner with this film , that should be seen by more people because it presents a real portrait of a man that was genuine and loved his family .
554675	1406078	446784	8.0	My architect	There is an awkward moment in Sydney Pollack's documentary " Sketches of Frank Gehry " , when the subject of the film confesses about his name change from Goldberg to Gehry . Nothing is made out of it , but perhaps that defines a key to understand the man whose monumental work is examined by his distinguished friend , the director , Sydney Pollack . This is an intimate portrait of the man whose grandiose vision separates him from other luminaries of that field . Frank Gehry is shown working in different projects . It's curious how this man doesn't even know how to use the computer in order to create his intricate designs . It helps he is now a celebrity and wealthy , as he can afford assistants that will execute his thoughts in that new medium he has yet to master . The documentary gives us an idea of the evolution of Mr . Gehry as an innovator and the way he arrived at his present position . It surprising to realize that one of the greatest influences for him was Alvar Aalto , the great architect from Finland . One can see how he can relate to this man , more so than to others that were at the top of his profession during his formative years . We get to hear from a lot of people and his peers . Milton Wexler , his personal analysts confesses how he has worked with Gehry for so many years . Philip Johnson also gives his assessment about the man . Ed Ruscha , the artist , talks about other aspects of Mr . Gehry's life and he even gives credit to the architect's wife , Berta in being a great influence in his life , yet , no one sees her ; only a picture is shown of her . On the other hand , Julian Schnabel , a pretentious artist himself , and dilettante movie director , is interviewed wearing a white bath robe as he pompously describes Gehry to the camera . We feel he is putting us on all the time , that he couldn't care less . He is an admirer of the spaces Gehry creates because they go well together with his art , and the way it's shown . Michael Ovitz , another shady figure , shows up to tell us how he compares Gehry's approach as a form of cubism . Well , who knew the movie mogul was an expert in this matter too ! One of the most obvious omissions in the film is not interviewing Dennis Hopper in the home that Gehry designed for him in Venice , California . Some of the best examples of Gehry's creations appear in the film . The magnificent Guggenheim museum in Bilbao , Spain is presented in all its splendor . The same goes for the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles . The other works are also shown , although , maybe because of the length of the documentary didn't allow to show more . At the end , when all is said and done , we see a man that like all artists is never satisfied by his own work .
555184	1406078	213847	8.0	The girl in the villa	In a way , " Malena " kept reminding us of a famous photograph by Ruth Orkin , in which a young American woman is seen walking alone in an Italian street where there must be about forty men that are ogling this beautiful young creature in different degrees of desire shouting things about what they would love to do with her . In Giuseppe Tornatore's " Malena " , the young woman at the center of the story , suffers that kind of sexual predatory practice from all the men in the little town in Sicily where she lives . It appears Italian men , then , as well as now , can express anything at all , especially for their big friends ' benefit , about their opinions of how they feel about a girl . Even the town's women have no qualms in shouting nasty things as Malena passes them by . If you haven't seen the film , perhaps you would like to stop reading . The film takes place during the last days of WWII . Malena's husband has gone to war , but he never returns . She is left to fend for herself under the most extreme circumstances . In order to make ends meet , all the men in town offer Malena anything so they can get favors from her in return . Watching all this is Renato , a young man who has reached puberty and is completely taken by Malena's beauty . Renato follows this woman all over the town . Whenever Malena is coming into view , Renato abandons his bicycle and makes a point to pass near this gorgeous creature almost breathing her aura . A lot of people in this forum have expressed their views in making " Malena " a coming of age film . But contrary to what they might take , Mr . Tornatore , its director , like most film makers in Europe are influenced by the politics and the history of their country . In here , it appears that Malena stands for the way Italy was manipulated by Mussolini in transforming the country into a fascist paradise . Also Malena , like Italy , is turned into a prostitute in the eyes of many Italians , who watched their beloved country invaded by the Germans , who were supposed to be their allies . " Malena " is a film that is blessed by the presence of that amazingly beautiful actress Monica Belucci . Ms . Belucci is perfect for the title role and runs away with the film . In one of the most hear wrenching scenes in this movie , we watch in horror as the other women in town have their revenge in punishing Malena for what they perceive are her sins and her collaboration with the enemy . Young Giuseppe Sulfaro is seen as the appealing Renato Amoroso , the young man awakening to his own sexuality . He lives just to spy on the woman that has captured his imagination , and even in his solitary gratification she plays a large role in his vivid imagination . " Malena " owes a lot to Giuseppe Tornatore for what he has been able to accomplish .
554969	1406078	286594	8.0	Insomnia	Nick Willing's thriller " Close your eyes " came as a total surprise as all I had read about the film was negative . Not only it is a mystery , but it keeps you engrossed in every twist and turn . This is the story of an American analyst , Dr . Michael Strother , who is working underground in London , treating patients who want to quit smoking . The visuals of the opening credits and the session with detective Janet Losey , are done with a cinematic sense that shows a lot of style from the creative team behind the director . This is a film that keeps the viewer engrossed in all what is happening on screen . There's never a dull moment as everything evolves in a logical and intelligent manner . The acting is flawless . The casting of Goran Visnjic , as Dr . Strother is excellent , as this actor makes one feel as though what is happening to him is a reflection of his failure in America . With his good dark looks and accent , he creates a complex character without much effort , or so it seems . As the detective , Shirley Henderson is equally good as the detective that will not give up in the pursuit of the evil force behind what has been done to the little girl at the center of the story . The rest of the cast is equally good . Fiona Shaw's Catherine Lebourg is equally spooky as she is mysterious . Paddy Considine as Elliot , is a key in solving the case . The film is for lovers of the genre . It won't disappoint .
556021	1406078	382073	8.0	Secrets and lies	Decepcion and secrecy seems to be the root of the burden Jonathan is carrying in his troubled soul . During the course of a few hours he will have to face the truth about himself as his past comes back to haunt him in ways he didn't realize it would affect him . Amy Fox has opened up her play by writing a wonderful screen treatment that Chris Terrio , the young and multi talented director presents for us with great panache . Ms . Fox created strong characters that come alive in the film . We are taken to some of Manhattan's rooftops and terraces to get a first rate account of people trying to deal with real problems . A point the film is trying to make is about how well do we know people close to us , even those we think we are in love with . At the center of the movie is Elizabeth , who is living with Jonathan . They are planning to get married . Elizabeth is a talented photographer who is a free lancer . Jonathan is Jewish , but she is not ; he wants her to go to see the Rabbi who is going to marry them . It's clear they are not at the same wave length , and not because they come from different religious backgrounds . Diane , Elizabeth's mother , is a much admired actress in the New York stage . She has an eye for spotting handsome young men , as it's the case when she auditions Alec , a young actor that wants to be in a play she is going to direct . It's clear she likes him for other non acting role as well . Diane and her present husband are married for appearances sake , as we get to see him in action with another woman . " Heights " makes an interesting point in showing how inter connected all these characters are and how a small , innocent incident , will unravel things as Elizabeth gets to see first hand how wrong she has been about the man she is going to marry . Glenn Close , as Diana , makes an amazing appearance in the film . She is such an elegant performer that knows well what makes Diana act the way she does . She is not a diva , on the contrary , she seems to be a grounded woman whose love for her daughter is clear . Elizabeth Banks is wonderful as Diana's daughter , Isabel . The surprise of the film came via George Segal , who as Rabbi Mendel , clearly sees what's troubling Jonathan . Mr . Segal is a welcome sight in the film after being absent so long . James Marsden , Jesse Bradford , Rufus Wainwright , Eric Bogosian , Michael Murphy and a lot of New York based stage actors are seen in minor , but effective roles . This film clearly demonstrates the talent of Chris Terrio bringing all these actors together to do ensemble work . Mr . Terrio is lucky to be working with Jim Denault who has photographed the film with such an elegant style . Also the music by Ben Butler and Martin Erskine enhances the film .
555296	1406078	22286	8.0	Grapefruit anyone ?	This was the film that made James Cagney a star . In a surprise move , Warner Brothers made him switch roles with Edward Woods , and the end is history . James Cagney , who made a career out of playing tough guys , appeared as Tom Powers , a young man who loved the company of all the Irish wise guys in his area . The film starts with a message from the studio about one is going to witness as it wanted to point to a social problem , and it ends with a sort of disclaimer about what was seen a social issue at the core of the society of those years . Tom Powers rises to the top of the crime scene when Prohibition went into effect . There was a lot of money to be made smuggling liquor and having pals like Paddy Ryan , who controlled the trade . Helped by his inseparable Matt Doyle , they make their mark as people that could get away with what the crimes they were committing . Tom Powers inspired violence because he was ruthless in the way he wanted to do things . The film , made before the arrival of the infamous Hays Code , gets away with showing the morality of the gangster on the scene and the women they went after . Tom's relationship with Kitty , and the cruelty he shows toward her , is something that the creators got away with . Tom's involvement with Gwen Allen , the beautiful blonde , is full of sexual suggestions . William Wellman , proved he was the right man for this movie . He brought the best in James Cagney and the rest of the cast . Unfortunately , the dialog sounds dated . The heavy make-up favored in those days looks funny of the men , especially . Mae Clarke , who is not even credited in the film , has one of the best moments of her film career in the movie . James Cagney and Edward Woods do some excellent work together . The sexy Jean Harlow is lovely to look at in this film as it brings her beauty to new heights . Donald Cook , Joan Blondell , and the rest of the supporting cast contribute to make one of the best films of the gangster genre .
556127	1406078	65872	8.0	Father and son	" I Never Sang for My Father " has to be one of the saddest films ever made . Relations between parents and grown up children are examined in this tight drama that rings true from beginning to end . We can relate to how the dynamics in a family change as parents get older and children are now involved in problems of their own with their families . This is basically about the special relationship between a father and a son . Tom Garrison , the father , is in his eighties . His son Gene has lost his wife and is now seeing a woman doctor in California . When Margaret , the mother , suffers a heart attack and dies , Tom and Gene come to a confrontation because the father wants to keep a grip on his son to help him during that adjustment period . Gene , who has always been a good son , has to make a decision that will put him at odds with his father . The idea of children taking care of their parents during their old age is questioned here . On the one hand , Tom , the father , is a self made man who struggled hard for all he achieved in life . Gene , the son , is in the eyes of the father , a failure , because of his passive nature . Tom has counted on relying on Gene for those late years and because of his intransigent nature , he is not willing to compromise in the solution the son has for him . The film version of Robert Anderson's play , and directed by Gilbert Cates , gathered a stellar cast to bring the family alive . Melvyn Douglas , in one of his best screen appearances , makes Tom Garrison come alive . Mr . Douglas ' take on his character shows a man that while giving an appearance of being strong , underneath , shows his vulnerability . Gene Hackman , who plays the son , is a perfect match for Melvyn Douglas . Their scenes together show a raw energy between a domineering father and a son that has gone along to please him . Estelle Parsons is seen as Alice , the estranged daughter and Dorothy Stickney who plays Margaret , the mother .
556199	1406078	35446	8.0	Playing Hamlet in Poland	Having seen most of Ernst Lubitsch American films , we had missed this one because it's not played often these days . " To Be , or not to Be " is a wonderful satire that only a director like Lubitsch , with his European background could have pulled . The film is a good comedy that seems to has kept some of its freshness intact . The film works because of the great contribution of Jack Benny and Carole Lombard , who sadly , died before the film had its premiere . They play the Turas , a Polish theatrical couple that foresee the Nazi invasion of their country . In fact , Jack Benny , a man associated as a comedian , first on radio , then on television , was an actor with an uncanny sense of timing . Mr . Benny was a natural for this type of comedy , as he proves in the film . His pairing with Carole Lombard was a stroke of genius . In fact , for being associated to lighter fare , he demonstrates with his take on Joseph Tura , he was an actor of stature . Carole Lombard is seen as Maria Tura , a grand dame of the Polish theater . Ms . Lombard gave a marvelous performance and her contribution to the success of this film is amazing . Robert Stack is seen as the pilot Sobinski . Other faces in the cast include Felix Bressard , Lionel Atwill , Sig Ruman , George Lynn , and others that are perfect under Ernst Lubitsch guidance . This is a film to be treasured because of the work of Jack Benny and the impeccable direction of Ernst Lubitsch .
555551	1406078	47408	8.0	The sound of music	" Rhapsody " is not the bad movie some of the comments to IMDb seem to indicate . While this was a film typical of the time when it was made , it offers some of the most glorious music ever heard in a Hollywood picture . The music takes center stage in the movie . As interpreted by Michael Rabin and Claudio Arrau , among others , Tchaikowsky , Liszt and Rachmaninoff were never given such loving tribute as in this film . Charles Vidor directed this adaptation of a novel that might have been well regarded , enough to be brought to the screen . Ruth and August Goetz are given credit for the screen play . The Goetzes wrote many plays , among them , " The Heiress " . Fay and Michael Kanin also contributed to the adaptation . The story of Louise " Lulu " Durant , a spoiled rich girl , that defied her father into following what she thought was the love of her life , turns out to be a nightmare . Lulu was not prepared to play second fiddle , no pun intended , to anyone , let alone Paul Bronte , the talented , but egotistical violinist that is only in love with his career . The story , by the way , takes place in Zurich , and not Munich , as someone reported in another comment . Lulu , who has ambitions of becoming a pianist , promptly realizes she is a lousy player and heeds the advice of the wise professor Schuman , but she makes the mistake of staying around , getting bored because Paul has only time for his music and not for her . Enter James Guest , an American pianist . He falls in love with the beautiful Lulu , only to be rejected . When Paul becomes the toast of the music world , he breaks from Lulu , who in turn marries James on the rebound . Ultimately , Lulu realizes that James is the one that is real and the only one that cares for her and there's a happy ending when he makes a stunning debut playing Rachmaninoff's Second Piano Concerto . Elizabeth Taylor , in all her beauty , is seen as the ravishing creature she was in those years . She made an impression as the spoiled " papa's girl " that she was . In this film , as well as all those Ms . Taylor made during those years , she projects such a loving presence that is hard to find fault with her acting . This actress showed such magnetism and charisma in her films , something perhaps no one else can match . Vittorio Gassman was perhaps Italy's best modern actor . He was trying to break into American movies . As Paul Bronte , he makes quite an impression . He was dashing and had the presence and good looks to play opposite his gorgeous costar . John Ericson shows he had potential to go far in the business . Unfortunately he never made it big in Hollywood . He was an accomplished actor who deserved better . Louis Calhern as Nicholas Durant , Lulu's father had only a few scenes in the movie , so it is puzzling for one to agree with another comment about how he carried the film on his shoulders . If it was , it remains a mystery to us . Mr . Calhern was a fine actor who show a natural elegance to every thing he did in the movies . Ms . Taylor is dressed by Helen Rose , one of the best in the business . Ms . Rose designs are an asset ; anything that Elizabeth Taylor wore in the film enhanced her figure and gave the viewer an opportunity to see her as the film goddess was always was .
556173	1406078	22074	8.0	Lubitsch's magic	Ernst Lubitsch came to Hollywood in the years before the " Code " , or censure , if you will , that plagued all artists working during that era . This is a clear example of what could be done in the movies when the scissors of the censor were not in the picture , no pun intended . If you haven't seen the film , please stop reading now . This film is based in an operetta . It's light , it's frothy , it's naughty , and it's a delight to watch it more than sixty years after it was made . Mr . Lubitsch was a genius in creating films that bore his signature like no other director of the time . His European background is constantly in display . He had a sensitivity for giving the viewer a glimpse of that old world he had left behind when he emigrated to America . Mr . Lubitsch worked with the best actors of the times . His choice of Maurice Chevalier , or maybe it wasn't his decision , but the studio's , pays handsomely in this movie . Mr . Chevalier brought his own style to the American cinema and he can be a bit strange in the way he reacts in front of a camera , but in spite of his school of acting , he went to become a favorite in this country too . Mr . Chevalier plays the bon vivant lieutenant in the Austrian army who has a roving eye for any beautiful woman that crosses his path . He finds that , and much more with Franzi , the violinist in charge of an all women's orchestra . It's clear what attracted Niki to Franzi ; she is a beauty who aims to please . There is no subterfuge in the relationship ; Franzi moves right in into Niki's apartment . This couldn't have been done in the movies later on , when the Hays code came into being . Claudette Colbert had a lot of charisma . In " The Smiling Lieutenant " she shows why she was a star in her own right . Ms . Colbert and Mr . Chevalier made these lovers look right . Nothing is done in the open and everything is done with great taste , although the viewer can guess what's really happening without too much guessing . To complicate matters , our lieutenant is fancied by a dowdy Princess Anna on a visit to Vienna . Since honor is at stake , Niki marries her , but his heart is left behind with Franzi . Niki doesn't want any part of this woman who has been imposed on him . When Franzi and the orchestra make an appearance in the neighboring country , Niki discovers her and they go back to their trysts whenever they find the time , to the chagrin of the princess . Franzi realizing she could never get Niki without causing a great scandal , gives in , and in the process , transforms the " ugly duckling princess " into a lovely swan . Miriam Hopkins playing Anna ends up with the man she wanted . The final scenes suggest that yes , they will have their fun after all . The set decorations of the film are breathtaking . The palace scenes , the costumes , take the viewer to the Austro-Hungarian empire . This film will please anyone looking for an easy time at the movies thanks to Ernst Lubitsch .
555126	1406078	43044	8.0	A dynamic duo	" Three Little Words " , MGM's tribute to two song writers that are not so well known , but who left behind a lot of beautiful songs , is a pleasant film from that era . Richard Thorpe , the director , clearly demonstrates he knew how to stage the material . Although not one of the best musicals the studio produced , and somewhat predictable , it offers a lot of entertainment . Best of all is the pairing of Fred Astaire and Red Skelton as the musical partners , Bert Kalmer and Harry Ruby . These actors do some nice work together as they came together to create musical comedy . Mr . Astaire's dancing partner is Vera-Ellen , who was a dominant figure in musical comedies . Mr . Astaire and Vera-Ellen do a good job in their dancing . A big surprise was to see a young Debbie Reynolds in her rendition of " I Wanna be Loved by You " , which later became associated with Marilyn Monroe's signature songs . The young Ms . Reynolds ' shows an amazing talent that would come to fruit in later films . Gloria de Haven and Arlene Dahl also grace the film with their presence , as well as Kennan Wynn , and other supporting players .
556028	1406078	166287	8.0	Duality in a macho society	The film has been shown in some festivals , but we don't think it had a commercial run in this country . We caught with it recently on DVD format . The movie , directed by Francisco Lombardi , is based on the novel by television personality and writer , Jaime Bayly , with an adaptation by Giovanna Pollarolo . The film is a frank account on the Peruvian society . It's clear from the start that Joaquin is gay . He has been sheltered by his mother , against his father's wishes . As a way to initiate the young boy in a the typical Peruvian man's world , Luis Felipe , the father , decides to take him hunting , with no good results . Then , the father takes the young man to one of Lima's best house of ill repute , an experience that ends badly . Joaquin likes Alejandra , the young college student . She feels the attraction as well , but Joaquin has an eye for attractive guys . When Gonzalo and Rocio appear at a disco , Joaquin feels attracted to the hunky young man . It's clear Gonzalo is also interested in Joaquin and thus begins their sexual involvement that will not produce the results either one expected . Gonzalo wants to keep seeing Joaquin , but wants to marry Rocio , but Joaquin , in a fit of anger confesses to the young woman her fiancé is having an affair with him and they Gonzalo leaves him . The movie is a complex character study about the duality most of these rich young men of the upper crust of the Peruvian society and how they feel about casual gay sex . In a society dominated by the machismo , they must hide away in a married life that is a cover up for the way homosexuality is concealed . The film is honest in the way it deals with this subject . Santiago Magill makes Joaquin credible in his appealing performance . Lucia Jimenez is also good as Alejandra , the girl that loved him . Christian Meier plays the closeted Gonzalo . Giovanni Ciccia's take on the troubled rich boy Alfonso is right . The rest of the cast does an excellent job in portraying all the upper class people in the movie . Francisco Lombardi directed with panache this story about a taboo in that type of society .
555764	1406078	55310	8.0	The age of innocence .	The atmosphere of this film took me back to another time and place , to a very naive and innocent Spain . This film is Garcia Berlanga's incursion into his own brand of neorealism . The music keeps evoking the scores of the great Italian masterpieces of that period . Placido , the hero , in a way , is everyman caught in a web of bureaucracy where he has to fight against all the odds to keep his vehicle in order to survive . He does whatever he can in order to pay the draft , but all conspires against him . Placido is a decent working person , a man of honor who has to fulfill his obligations , in this case , paying the draft that is due on the day the story unfolds . Everything is against him . We see him fighting his way to do so , in this , his long journey into the Christmas Eve celebration . Cassen was a marvelous and charismatic actor who was very convincing as Placido . He's always at the center of the action , and at times , he is even at the center of some of the other characters conflicts . Jose Luis Lopez Vazquez , is very effective as Gabino , the photographer . The rest of the ensemble cast perform very well under the direction of Garcia Berlanga . The film is a lot of fun .
556019	1406078	40104	8.0	Housing shortage	George Seaton's " Apartment for Peggy " was a surprise that was shown on cable recently . This 1948 film is a wonderful reminder of how Hollywood used to make comedy by taking amazing talent out of a pool of superb cinema actors . The film is based on a Faith Baldwin novel , which the director adapted for the screen . " Apartment for Peggy " tackles the problem the housing shortage right after WWII . We are taken to a college town where some students are feeling the pinch and must adapt to whatever they could get from meager accommodations . It's this way how Peggy , a young pregnant wife of a student at the university , comes upon an attic apartment that Prof . Henry Barnes didn't even remember he had . Prof . Barnes wants to commit suicide , so Peggy , and her husband Jason , are in his way to accomplish the task . Prof . Barnes feels old and left out , when in reality , he has so much to give , not only to his newly found tenants , but to the community where he lives as well . Delightful performances by the cast was what George Seaton got from everyone . Edmund Gwenn makes an impression as Prof . Barnes . Mr . Gwenn was a man that went to enhance all the films in which he appeared . Jeanne Crain is the Peggy of the title ; a beautiful woman in the prime of her youth . It was obvious the camera adored her . William Holden made a likable Jason . Gene Lockhart is excellent , as always , but we didn't expect anything short of greatness out of him , or the rest of the cast . " Apartment for Peggy " will delight anyone looking for a good time watching this film .
555268	1406078	443543	8.0	The conjurer	Early in life , Eisenheim understands how his destiny is going to be tied to magic . Unfortunately for the young man , after falling in love for a rich young girl , Sophie , his powers prove to be a failure when he can't prevent the young woman from being taken away from him . Sophie will always keep the locket with a secret mechanism Eisenheim made for her as a reminder of his love . For fifteen long years Eisenheim roams the world trying to perfect his craft as a magician . When the time is ripe , he returns to Vienna to look for his long lost love and to dazzle audiences with his amazing tricks . It is at his Vienna appearances that his fame reaches the crown prince Leopold , who wants to see this illusionist .

Eisenheim recognizes his beloved Sophie who still wears the locket around her neck . Things get complicated when Eisenheim is asked to do a performance for the prince at the palace . The one trick that stuns everyone is when the conjurer asks the prince for his sword , which he makes stand on the stage . He then asks members of the audience to try to lift the sword , which magically remains glued to the ground . Only when he tells Leopold to take the sword back , the sword is released to its rightful owner . That sword will yield a valuable clue to the mystery we are witnessing later on . Eisenheim made an admirer in Uhl , the chief of police who is impressed by what he sees Eisenheim do on stage . Uhl will be the only man who will understand the secret that Eisenheim keeps in his heart . This highly enjoyable movie directed by Neil Burger , is based on a short story by Steven Millhauser . The adaptation by Mr . Burger gets a great treatment for the screen . The film is helped by the interesting score of Philip Glass . Mr . Burger has done wonders with the way he envelops the audience with magic as one watches in amazement how Eisenheim performs his thrilling act . Dick Pope photographed the movie in dark tones that reflect the mood of most of the action on the screen . His take on the Czech exteriors strike the right note . Naomi Geraghty must be congratulated for the editing , since it involves the way the viewer perceives the tricks being done by Eisenheim . Edward Norton gives a wonderful performance as Eisenheim . He is clearly a man with a mission in life and he has returned to his native land to take what he believes is rightfully his . Paul Giamatti's Inspector Uhl has some good moments too . Lovely Jessica Biel is seen as Sophie and Rufus Sewell plays the crown prince Leopold . " The Illusionist " will not disappoint fans of Edward Norton because the good work of the director , Neil Burger , did in adapting the original material for this highly engrossing picture .
555368	1406078	856008	8.0	Swimming with sharks	Sharks , predators of the oceans , are in danger of extinction . It's a horrifying fact that Canadian filmmaker Rob Stewart wants the world to know . These creatures have been around for thousands of years . They are hunted by unscrupulous people that want their fins which are considered a delicacy and command big prices , specially in Asian countries . Mr . Stewart and his team follow the criminals that engage in this illegal activity in places such as Costa Rica and Ecuador . The sharks are an important element in the way they contribute to an ecological balance in the universe . Mr . Stewart shows his admiration and respect for this species as we watch him in a dancelike sequence swimming among these predators without anyone of them disturbing the peace he finds being almost one of them . The documentary is informative and instructive at the same time . Mr . Stewart and his crew have captured amazing images that will stay in our minds for quite some time . Jeff Rona's original music and Mr . Stewart's own cinematography contribute to enhance the viewer's enjoyment .
555720	1406078	55824	8.0	The River	This film was ahead of its time in many ways . It's based on the John MacDonald's novel and directed by Lee J Thompson , with a terrific musical score by the amazing Bernard Hermann . The copy recently presented by TCM is perfect in that it is very detailed as it has been preserved with extreme care . This film belongs to Robert Mitchum . His Max Cady is a complex study of evil at its worst . This is a man who wants revenge for what he perceives society owes him , or what Sam Bowden , in particular has done to him ; he will stop at nothing . There are hints of pedophilia in the way Max Cady leers at the teen age daughter of his enemy ; it's done with a lot of class and it's never in your face . Robert Mitchum was an actor of such intelligence that is such a pleasure watch him portray this criminal , intent in doing harm to the man who sent him to jail , as well as to his family . Mr . Mitchum works with an economy of gestures , but one look at him and the viewer knows what makes this Max Cady ticks . Gregory Peck , on the other hand plays the good guy , but he is boring . Mr . Peck , supposedly , championed Mr . Mitchell for the role of Cady , knowing that he would be perfect for the part . It is after all Mr . Mitchell's picture from beginning to end . The supporting cast was excellent . Polly Bergen , Lori Martin , Martin Balsam , Telly Savallas , all in minor roles , but they add tremendously to the action . In retrospect , a lot of comments tend to compare the latter version of the film directed by Scorsese . Many think it's much better . Those people that make that claim are entitled to their opinion , but the original is more satisfying as far as we are concerned .
554812	1406078	407936	8.0	A slice of life	The main reason for watching this picture is to savor the brilliant performance of S . Ephata Merkerson . Ms . Merkerson dominates this film with her tremendous presence as Nanny , the woman who believes in doing good , no matter to whom , with no strings attached . This actress clearly shows a range that is amazing . Thanks to director George Wolf for bringing this distinguished cast of some of the best Black Americans actors together . This ensemble group under his tight direction help create the right atmosphere in which the action takes place . Of course , none of this would have been possible if Ruben Santiago Hudson hadn't written his wonderful play . Working with Mr . Wolf , perhaps the best theater director of this generation , they have opened the play in a way that it evokes that not too distant past where a child lives under the influence of Ms . Crosby , when his own parents are not around to take care of him . Ms . Crosby becomes the adoring mother of little Ruben ; in a way , he represents her reward for having lost her own daughter . Unfortunately , there is no time to develop some of the characters , as the action solely concentrates in enhancing the relationship between Nanny and the young Ruben , played with such charm by the young Marcus Carl Franklin , who is a natural . The only thing that could have been done differently was the voice over narration that is at times intrusive , as it doesn't clarify , or justify what one is seeing . Frankly , just by watching the interaction of the players , is self explanatory . In the background there is always music . No matter what hard times these people are going through , but Nanny's house is full of laughter and that glorious music that takes us back to that era . Aside from Ms . Merkerson , other notable performances are given by Terrence Dashon Howard , one of the rising stars of the moment . Mos Def , Jeffrey Wright , Marcy Gray , Louis Gossett Jr . , Delroy Lindo , Rosie Perez , Carmen Ejogo , Jimmy Smits and the rest . Ms . S . Ephata Merkerson deserves to be seen by a wider audience . In " Lackawanna Blues " , she clearly demonstrates she can do anything she wants because of her enormous talent and charisma .
555508	1406078	244476	8.0	El Gallo	Miguel Del Morales is a happy musician that is seen traveling from Havana to the eastern end of the island , as he pays a visit to the place where some of the best music of Cuba originates . In the process , he takes us along to meet his friends and people that have a lot in common with him as they all speak the same language : music ! Karim Dridi , a French director , welcomes us aboard to follow Miguel , better known as El Gallo , as he arrives in Santiago , a traditional place where some of Cuba's best musicians were born . Miguel , a man in his seventies , seems to be much younger than his years because he has the right attitude toward life ; Miguel lives to make music and is right at home jamming with strangers . We are shown different people Miguel meets along the way . There's always laughter and the beautiful music everyone seems to have a passion for . Thus , we are taken to hear Mirta Gonzalez , a woman of a certain age , but who shows more energy and joy than many others half her age . There is also Pepin Vaillant , a man who plays his horn and gets a lot of beautiful sounds out of it . There is Parsan Mallet , another old timer who plays the traditional son . Even the new generation , like the rapper Eulises Sanchez , has some nice harmonies for us to hear . Zayda Reyte , has an impromptu session as she answers her door to find musicians that are there to serenade her and she joins the traditional song one hears . The film doesn't make any political statements . " Cuba Feliz " is indeed a loving look at a place where most of its people rely on music to get them through their day ; they are poor , yet most of the people one sees in the film are truly rich in tradition . The music seems to be their subsistence and what nourishes their souls .
555340	1406078	293191	8.0	The limited war zone	The conflict in Kossovo serves as backdrop for this Spanish film . Directed by Daniel Calparsoro , whose " Asfalto " we recently saw , is an intense film that takes the viewer behind the horrible war in that part of Europe . How similar is the movie in comparison to the real events , we can't say , for sure . We are presented with a group of Spanish soldiers that are sent to restore electric power to a small town . As the group approaches the Serbian border , they encounter an unexpected turn of events as they are attacked by one of the factions and end up straying into a no man's land where no one is supposed to enter . The soldiers are faced with the horrors of a war they were just supposed to stay away from . Vidal , the daring soldier , is instrumental for getting them back in track after the Lt . Alonso suffers what appears to be a shock . Alonso turns out to show all signs of a coward when he is captured . It's only Vidal who at the start appears to be the one that wants to be sent home in order to avoid any confrontation ; this young man proves to be a natural born leader who finds a way to get back after experiencing some tense moments in that forbidden zone . The best thing in the film is Eloy Azorin , a talented young actor who is perfect for the role of Vidal . Eduardo Noriega , an actor who has done better in other films , is quite a puzzle as the cowardly lieutenant . Ruben Ochandiano , Carla Perez and Jordi Vilches are seen as part of the platoon of Spanish soldiers . Daniel Calparsoro seems to be getting better and better all the time .
554810	1406078	354899	8.0	The science of dreams	The title of this film should have been translated as " The Science of Dreams " , the same as its French title . It makes more sense , in that dreams are always full of possibilities . Most of what we are presented in the picture deals in how Stephane's mind functions and the dreams he so vividly enacts for us . Michel Gondry's wonderful new film , which he wrote himself , proves he is a man not afraid of showing us this whimsical character , Stephane , who seems to be living in his own magical universe . Mr . Gondry , uses a different technique , getting away from obvious special effects . By having Stephanie making her own kind of art , he blends two different worlds in what appears to be a seamless union . Some comments we have read make Stephane as a crazy young man , when in reality he is a dreamer . The best way to enjoy this film is to let it envelop you and just let it charm you without any preconceived expectations . Gael Garcia Bernal , who plays Stephane , keeps getting better all the time . He seems to be akin to the material the director wrote for him and he excels as this childlike man who lives in a fantasy world . On the other hand , Charlotte Gainsbourg makes the perfect foil with her Stephanie . She sees what Stephane is like and accepts him , even though their relationship is put to a test . The supporting cast , Alain Chabat , Miou Miou , and Emma DeCaunes , among others , contribute to make this film the charmer it is . Michel Gondry is a director that always amazes . He proves it with this film .
556530	1406078	48140	8.0	Times Square according to Damon Runyon	Damon Runyon's world of Times Square , in New York , prior to its Disneyfication , is the basis for this musical . Joseph L . Mankiewicz , a man who knew about movies , directed this nostalgic tribute to the " crossroads of the world " that show us that underside of New York of the past . Frank Loesser's music sounds great . We watch a magnificent cast of characters that were typical of the area . People at the edges of society tended to gravitate toward that area because of the lights , the action , the possibilities in that part of town . This underbelly of the city made a living out of the street life that was so intense . Some of the songs from the original production were not included in the film . We don't know whether this makes sense , but this is not unusual for a Hollywood musical to change and alter what worked on the stage . That original cast included the wonderful Vivian Blaine and Stubby Kaye , and we wonder about the decision of not letting Robert Alda , Sam Levene , Isabel Bigley repeat their original roles . These were distinguished actors that could have made an amazing contribution . The film , visually , is amazing . The look follows closely the fashions of the times . As far as the casting of Marlon Brando , otherwise not known for his singing abilities , Frank Sinatra and Jean Simmons , seem to work in the film . Sky Masterson is , after all , a man's man , who would look otherwise sissy if he presented a different ' look ' . Frank Sinatra is good as Nathan Detroit . Jean Simmons , as Sarah Brown , does a nice job portraying the woman from the Salvation Army who suddenly finds fulfillment with the same kind of man she is trying to save . Vivian Blaine is a delight . She never ceases to amaze as Miss Adelaide , a woman with a heart of gold who's Nathan Detroit's love interest . Ms . Blaine makes a fantastic impression as the show girl who is wiser than she lets out to be . Stubby Kaye makes a wonderful job out of reprising his Nicely Nicely Johnson . The wonderful production owes a lot to the talented Abe Burrows , who made the adaptation to the screen . The costumes by Irene Sharaff set the right tone .
555911	1406078	377107	8.0	Advanced Math	" Proof " , the excellent play by David Auburn , was one of the best things in the New York stage in recent memory . Part of the attraction was the intelligent subject matter , math science , and how it connected the four characters one got to meet . The casting was an ideal one , Mary Louise Parker , Larry Briggman , Johanna Day and Ben Shenkman , playing Cahterine , Robert , Claire and Hal , respectively . Mr . Auburn and Rebecca Miller , a movie director , herself , took the task of adapting " Proof " for the screen . The result , directed by John Madden , opens the play in cinematic terms , no small undertaking in presenting the movie to a wider audience who might not be interested in science , and much less in the advanced math that plays an important role in the proceedings . If you haven't seen the film , please stop reading here . Catherine , the 27 year old , at the center of the film , is a woman who has stayed behind to take care of her aging father , a man much esteemed in academic circles , who is suffering from , perhaps , a neurological illness that is killing him slowly . Catherine has , in a way , sacrificed her life in order to see that Robert spends his last days at home instead of at an institution . The death of the father brings Claire home . This woman , who lives in New York , wants to get rid of everything connected with her father . She even has made plans for Catherine to move from Chicago to be near each other in New York , where things are much better . To complicate things , Harold , the nerdy math student , finds a hidden notebook that might contain a discovery that will revolutionize math . The only problem is the proof might not have been the dead man's own creation . " Proof " works as a film because of Mr . Madden's direction . We are kept involved in what is going on because we have been won by Catherine , the wounded woman trying to live her life without having to tend to a sick man . Catherine love for math , in a way , makes her realize her place is in the same institution where her father made mathematical discoveries as she will be following his steps . Gwyneth Paltrow makes an excellent Catherine , a role she had played on the London stage . Ms . Paltrow is a welcome presence in the movie because of the intelligence she projects when working with a good director like John Madden . In fact , it has been a while since we saw this actress in a film . Hope Davis , another excellent actress , plays Claire , the materialistic sister who has arrived and who wants to transform the frumpy Catherine and mold her to her own taste . Ms . Davis has accustomed us to expect a valuable contribution to any film in which she plays . As Claire , she clearly understand who this character she is portraying really is . Anthony Hopkins has only a few good moments on the screen . Jake Gyllenhaal's character Harold is not as effective as Ben Shenkman's was on the stage . In fact , Mr . Gyllenhaal , with his dark good looks , seems to be someone who would not be interested in math at all . " Proof " is an immensely rewarding film thanks to what John Madden's vision .
555170	1406078	44391	8.0	Making movies	" The Bad and the Beautiful " takes a look at Hollywood . This incisive take about how movies are made , directed by Vincente Minnelli , dares to go behind the scenes to show what goes on in the way the film industry operates . The film adaptation by Charles Schnee gives us a good idea of that unreal world of fantasy and hype . At the center of the story is Jonathan Shields , a young man with connections to the industry . He wants to follow his father's footsteps and goes at it vigorously , making friends and enemies along the way . Jonathan discovers he can be ruthless whenever he wants . His first victim is Fred Amiel , the talented director who Jonathan bypasses in favor of a more established one . Jonathan quickly forgets the friendship Fred and his wife showed him before becoming a big producer . Then there is there is Georgia Larrion , the boozy daughter of a famous actor . Jonathan shows how he wants Georgia to succeed in the business , personally taking care of selling her to star in his big project , only to betray her with another woman , a glamorous bit player . When Georgia discovers the truth , she flees Jonathan's mansion in a clear night that suddenly turns into a torrential downpour and loses control of the car , but she doesn't suffer a scratch ! The last victim of Mr . Shields is the Pulitzer prize winner , James Lee Bartlow , who Jonathan coaxes into leaving his academic life to adapt his own novel for the movies . James is married to the flighty Rosemary , in whom Jonathan discovers a weak link that will do anything to hobnob with the celebrities . Jonathan makes it easy for Rosemary to fall into an affair with the star of Shields ' film . When we first watched this film , it seemed much better , than on this viewing where a lot of things surface to make some of the story much weaker than before . Some viewers have compared this film with the fate of Orson Welles in Hollywood , and there are a couple of references that could be interpreted that way . Whether it was so , or not , it's up to the viewer to guess where the truth lies . Kirk Douglas gave a strong performance as Jonathan Shields . Mr . Douglas showed he clearly understood who this man was . He runs away with the film , in our humble opinion . Lana Turner , a beautiful presence in any movie , is good , but at times she appears to be overwhelmed by the range of emotions she has to project , especially with that phony car scene . Dick Powell and Gloria Graham put in an excellent appearance as the Bartlows . Barry Sullivan disappears after Lana shows up , not to be seen until the end . Walter Pigeon is effective as the studio head . Gilbert Roland is perfect as Gaucho , the Latin actor with a lot of charisma . Mr . Minnelli shows he wasn't afraid to portray the industry the way we see it in the film , not a small accomplishment , knowing well how it could have backfired on him . Hollywood is not forgiving to those who dare to show its ugly side and that's when the parallel with Orson Welles problems with the system and eventual exile can be drawn .
555392	1406078	110427	8.0	Entrapped	This film was shown as part of a Vancouver Film Festival several years ago , where also Mr . Perez's " La Vida es Silbar " was presented in 1999 . Last night it was shown as part of CUNY Cinematheque . One can't help but to think that Madagascar is the continuation of Hello Hemingway , which was presented last week in the same venue . Could it be that director Fernando Perez is continuing the story about what happened to the young girl in the first film after she grew up and had her own family ? It seems to this viewer it could be possible . The mother and the daughter are trapped in their surroundings . They are constantly moving around . What happened to the mother , as a young woman , is happening to the young girl right now . The young Laurita wants to get away from it all , the same way as her mother did in the first story . Looking at the young woman one can predict that maybe at one point in her life , she might commit suicide . Also , Laurita seems to be totally disenchanted by what life has dealt her . The mother's world is very limited . She goes to her teaching job , although one never sees her tutoring anyone . She sits in the faculty room , surrounded by bored teachers . She is finally recognized by the dean of the university , but at that moment she is given a postcard from a former student that has gone to Paris . She tells a fellow teacher she couldn't care less to know Paris , or London or Rome , perhaps because it is impossible to even think about going away from the responsibility of having her mother and daughter to support . Also , the teacher one sees sharpening the pencil announces she will be going to another town , away from the capital . The mother recalls her youth several times , once mentioning the fun she had with a mulatto friend who turned into a model and how she also had pet mice but all disappeared leaving only the female behind . Could she be saying they have been left behind by men that went abroad ? At the height of her despair , she burns a chicken dish she is cooking and laments how everything is against her . The grandmother's role is very symbolic in that she is seen playing monopoly , a game that wouldn't mean anything in a marxist society . We hear her while she is playing saying to her partner that she will buy as many properties as she can . Ultimately , isn't the title of the film revealing ? That society has failed , for reasons that also made the island of Madagascar socialist regime fail . Also , the island has become a prison where no one escapes , and nothing makes sense at all , be it because of the " special period " , or because the ' blockade ' of the country . Fernando Perez obviously knows what he is saying , very well . It is a piercing look he is sharing with us . It is probably very painful for the director to tell it , but he had the courage to do it .
555082	1406078	335013	8.0	The Joffrey	" The Company " seems to be the right vehicle for director Robert Altman to tackle . It has all the Altman's elements in it . A lot of people crowding the screen , incomprehensible dialog among the different parties we eavesdrop along the way , and magnificent dance numbers supplied by the Joffrey Ballet , that used to be based here in New York , but has moved to greener pastures and perhaps more funding in Chicago . The world of a ballet company comes to life thanks to Neve Campbell's interest in it . She evidently was instrumental for bringing the film to life . The story is about the company , but it takes a look at Ms . Campbell , who plays one of the leading roles . One gets to see the mechanism of the daily life in the rehearsal studio where the dancers meet for their daily routines . We see them preparing for the season . We realize this people in the company are human beings . We watch at the beginning of the film how Ry , is picked to replace one of the ballerinas because she's noticed by the ballet master to be dancing with a neck injury . This young woman is devastated , but has no other choice to go along with the company's policy . She sees how Ry makes a splash dancing the piece that probably will be her signature . In a way , it's ironic that this same woman will step at the end to substitute for an injured Ry . The case is made in the film about dancers that suffer injuries : they can be substituted in no time flat by other dancers waiting in the wings . The film is about dance , it captures the atmosphere of the world of ballet . We see an egotistical Albert , the head of the company , as he dominates and rules over everybody and everything . In a world where a lot of gays have excelled with their contributions and innovations , only a few words are said in passing . Robert Joffrey , the founder and guiding spirit of his ballet company is not even mentioned ! Antonelli , upon receiving an award given by an Italian organization makes the case for tolerance for boys aspiring to be ballet dancers , but it doesn't ring true . The story of Ry's love affair with Josh , is only secondary in the film . One wonders what will become of their love , as nothing comes out of what one sees in the picture . Also , we see that in ballet , as well as in other performing arts , age is anathema for the people that dare to appear older . There's always another young talent that will eclipse the older performer . In fact , one of the most relevant parts involves an ballerina who confesses to be forty three and she is patronized by the tyrannical Antonelli . The dancing is nothing short of spectacular . The pas de deux danced by Ry and Domingo is exquisite . The opening number is a typical Joffrey work that shows this versatile company at it's best . Unfortunately , one never sees a full length work because of the limitations of the film . Neve Campbell strikes the right mood for Ry . James Franco , doesn't have much to do . One hardly hears him speak ! Malcom McDowell , as the artistic director Antonelli , gives an over the top performance . His take on this man is right on target . Robert Altman is ultimately the man with the vision . He offers us an inside view of the world of ballet , as he conceives it . He moves the camera to surprising angles to make the dancing come alive . This is another excellent film by Robert Altman .
555069	1406078	421239	8.0	Air travel is not what it used to be !	Wes Craven , a man who knows a thing , or two , about scaring the viewer , is at it again with his new film , " Red Eye " , which proves to be a surprising late summer entry . As a thriller , the film owes a lot to the director . The screen play by Carl Ellsworth is clear and it makes sense with a plot that could well happen . Lisa Reisert is used to working with the demanding public she has to deal with on a daily basis as one of the managers of the luxury hotel in Miami where she probably has to use all her tact in order to keep the egos of the guests that come to the hotel looking to be pampered . Having been to her grandmother's funeral in Texas , she is on her way back home when her flight takes a lengthy delay . Lisa meets on the checking line a young man , Jackson Rippner , who shows an interest in Lisa , and who , surprise , surprise , is seated next to her on the flight ! It turns that Jackson has more than a passing fancy for the beautiful Lisa . As a thriller , the film packs a lot in its action . We never feel bored , or let down by what Mr . Craven has in store for us . The acting , especially by the brilliant Cillian Murphy , who plays Jackson , is first rate , like anything this young actor does . Ms . McAdams is also good as the spunky girl who will not let anyone put one over her . The supporting cast has Brian Cox , Jayma Maya , and Jack Scalia , among the players . " Red Eye " is only eighty five minutes long , but it certainly will thrill any fans of Mr . Craven and of the genre .
556125	1406078	426578	8.0	Courage	Sophie Scholl , at one point of her trial , tells the judge and his cronies , as well as the audience of cowards attending the proceedings , that soon they all will be seating in the place she is now occupying . History proved her right as most of the same people that condemned her for treason were proved to be the real traitors . Marc Rothemund , the director , working on Fred Beinersdorfer's screen play , presents us with a courageous figure , Sophie Scholl , who saw the atrocities the Third Reich was doing to her country and dared to speak about it when confronted by the regime . Sophie was part of the student's organization , White Rose , that wanted to inform the German people about facts that were never challenged by anyone because of the consequences such action would mean for whoever spoke the truth . Sophie and her brother were instrumental for several pamphlets informing the population about things that the regime's propaganda didn't tell the German people . Sophie mentioned the unmentionable , the extermination of the Jews , and even the elimination of sick children by people gone mad . The main part of the film involves the interrogation Robert Mohr subjects Sophie as soon as she is arrested . In their exchange Sophie shows an amazing courage and never is seen as being scared of what will happen to her . After she admits to the charges , even Mohr seems to be amazed by her intelligence and resolve . Julia Jentsch is the main reason for seeing this movie . Ms . Jentsch gives a luminous performance as the woman who challenged the higher ups in charge of her country . Gerald Alexander Held , who is seen as Robert Mohr , makes an impression as the man who questions Sophie's motives and tries to break her spirit . Johanna Gastdorf is seen as the kind Else , who shares a cell with Sophie . " Sophie Scholl " is an intelligent film that shows a talented director , Marc Rothemund , and a bright young star of the German cinema , Julia Jentsch , in a film about courage and decency during a crazy time where all hope seemed to have disappeared from Germany .
555150	1406078	51742	8.0	Alma Duval	Alma Duval , the woman at the center of this tale , has given her all to raising her family . She has been married more than twenty years to a man that really doesn't appreciate what he has at home . Her three grown children are facing problems of their own . Yet , for all what is bad around her , Alma is the eternal optimist . When we first meet her , she is delivering gifts to her three children that are to be given to their father later on that evening because it's his birthday . Alma hasn't trusted her kids to buy presents for their father , and instead , she has taken the initiative . But instead of being a happy occasion , the birthday celebration turns out to be an unhappy non event because the older Duval has plans to spend the night with his latest girlfriend . Alma is heartbroken . Not only her plans for a small party for her husband has gone awry , but when she tells him about going back to a small town they have left some years ago in order to come to New Orleans , it falls on deaf ears , for he has no intention of ever going back . There are other problems as well . Buddy , the eldest son , wants to go into a new business that shows great potential . His father flatly refuses to go along without hearing about the benefits . The daughter , Virginia , is in love with a medical student that has no serious ideas about their romance . Finally , young Billy , is a complex young man who seems to be having an identity problem . Billy , a sensitive youth , seems to be repulsed by the way his father treats him and his mother . He might be gay , for all we know ; he wants to leave this unhappy environment behind and have his own life . " Hot Spell " , which is based on a novel , feels like it could have been a stage play . Not ever having heard of it , but attracted by the work of its director , Daniel Mann , and the star of the film , Shirley Booth , we were happily surprised with this tight drama , that although a bit predictable , makes a satisfying movie . Mr . Mann and Ms . Booth had collaborated before with happy results in " Come Back Little Sheba " , and they show to have a happy rapport with the material that is the basis of the picture . Anthony Quinn plays the husband that has fallen out of love with his wife a long time ago and has a roving eye for pretty young women that could be his own daughters . Earl Holliman has limited opportunities , and the same goes for Shirley MacLaine . On the other hand , Clint Kimbrough , as Billy , shows he understood the young man he is portraying . Eileen Heckart was great fun to watch as Alma's kind friend and neighbor . This is a film to watch the talented Shirley Booth , who runs away with the picture and makes it her own .
555750	1406078	365938	8.0	Closure	A family tragedy changed the lives of the Winters family . When we meet them , Jim , a landscape gardener , and his two children , Gabe and Pete , have not gotten over the death of the woman who held this family together . At this juncture of their lives , they appear resigned with what happened to them . The somewhat quiet family atmosphere is going to be suddenly changed . Jim , the father , who has not seen another woman since his wife's death , is suddenly awakened from his lethargy with the arrival of a well meaning woman who is house sitting for friends in the neighborhood . Molly is a fine listener ; she hears what Jim has to tell her , as he opens to recount the anguish , he and his children , have been living . Gabe , the older son , is seeing Stacey , a lovely young woman who loves him in return . It comes as a shock when Gabe informs his father and brother he is moving to Tampa . Jim's immediate reaction is to ask " What about Stacey " , to which he responds " I'm dealing with it " . Gabe wants to leave the oppressive home atmosphere to re-start his life in a new area . His brother Peter , who was with his mother when the accident happened , can't express his feelings ; he has kept his emotions bottled inside him . He is a bright young man , but does poorly in school , something one of his teachers , tries to get him to respond and participate in class . Josh Sternfeld created a sensitive and beautifully restrained film that shows that not all in life is rosy and that people suffer when tragedy strikes . The director , who also wrote the screen play , knows this family well . Not everything is gloom and doom because we realize , as we watch , things will improve , especially for Jim , who is attracted by a woman who clearly understands his situation . Anthony LaPaglia , who is also credited as one of the producers , shows he was the right actor to portray Jim Winters . This talented man doesn't make a false movement and stays true to his character all the time . Mr . LaPaglia , who worked with Allison Janney on Broadway in Arthur Miller's " A View From the Bridge " , is again reunited with his co-star and they feel right for one another . Ms . Janney's Molly , although not a showy role , gives her an opportunity to shine . Aaron Stanford is seen as the older son , Gabe , and Mark Webber is Peter . Both actors do a credible job under the sure direction of Mr . Sternfeld . Ron Livingston is the kind teacher who sees possibilities in Peter and Michele Monaghan is perfect as Stacey , the girl that is dumped without much logic , by Gabe . " Winter Solstice " was beautifully photographed by Harlan Bosmajian , who captures the world of suburbia in all its glory . The atmospheric music is by John Leventhal . Josh Sternfeld created an intimate portrait about pain and anguish , as this family
554727	1406078	39190	9.0	Touched by an angel	Dudley , the angel , comes to earth to teach a thing or two to the people of this town , or so it seems . He touches everyone he encounters in a positive way . The message is how we humans get so involved in things that are so unimportant that we miss the big picture . This film , directed by Henry Koster , is a classic . In fact , I am surprised it doesn't play more during Christmas , or maybe I have missed seeing it around that time of the year that is the setting for the angel's appearance . It seems as though Dudley is pointing to the arrival of Christmas at a time , perhaps , when the season had still a non-commercial aspect and it was , after all , a family affair . The cast was exceptional . Cary Grant is Dudley , the man / angel who turns everything he touches into a lesson on how to be kind . Julia , the bishop's wife , plays the neglected woman with conviction . David Niven plays the preoccupied bishop who is trying to bring the moneyed people of town to his side in order to erect his monument to his own ego . Gladys Cooper is also a distinguished face in the film . She is Mrs . Hamilton who learns a thing or two about humility . Elsa Lanchester was a happy figure in whatever film she appeared . Monty Woolley , as the professor is also effective . James Gleason was one of the most prolific character actors of his generation . He is excellent as Sylvester , the taxi driver who befriends Julia and Dudley . Their ice skating sequence is one of the best things of the film . This is a film to treasure .
556235	1406078	269329	9.0	Nothing to do with the original novel	I can now understand why authors feel leery about letting screenwriters adapt a novel . First of all , a full length novel doesn't translate well to the screen . There are too many nuances and too many details , that trying to do them all , will humble the most talented scribe . Take the case of the novel in which this film is based . The Tree of Hands by the magnificent British master of suspense , Ruth Rendell . The adaptation has nothing to do with the brilliant narrative she gave us with this novel . If anyone wants to see the best adaptation of a Rendell book , I would recommend to see Claude Chabrol's , " La Ceremonie " . Not only was that a superior film , but it reveals the essence of the book with little effort . The problem with " Alias Betty " is Mr Miller's scenario . He has changed the basic premise of the book into something else . Now , don't get me wrong , it is a better film than some of the mediocrity coming from France lately . The big problem is with the character of the mother . Nicole Garcia is out of her range here . Not only that , one never understands what's wrong with her , even though she appears to be schizophrenic . She's a loose cannon up to no good . In the novel she's even more so . Betty is ambiguously played by Sandrine Kiberlain , which in a way , suits the character better . She is the only sane person around , even though she is unable to control the mother . The minor side plots add to the story , but everything at the end is resolved so easily that one wonders if anything like that is possible in life . The films end in an upbeat note , even though it has nothing to do with the original novel .
555956	1406078	286179	10.0	The heat in the Sunshine State .	John Sayles ' films are always interesting . He provokes his audiences to think about what he shows on the screen . This is his latest attempt to draw our attention to the perils of overdevelopment in Florida by unscrupulous people who have nothing invested in the areas where they go to disrupt the lives of different communities , like the one presented in the film . Unfortunately , nothing changes for the better . In many cases it only brings unwanted growth , crime , tackiness in the name of progress . There are very old towns in the Sunshine State that are targeted to be sold by the locals in power as it's the case with the fictional Delrona Beach who , no doubt , are in cahoots with the developers . We can't help but wonder why would anyone in the right mind would go along with those who want to transform these laid back little towns on both Florida coasts and change them into the boring gated communities and condos that dot the landscape . The Greek Chorus led by Alan King and cronies are incredibly on target . They couldn't care less what was there before as long as they can golf every day in the immaculate courses created for their pleasure . Edie Falco is a revelation in this film . She's the one that goes in and out of the different groups with a sense of belonging to the town , obviously not making a very lucrative living out of a beach motel that has seen better days . Even though she has left the town for her own reasons she has come back to run the family business . Angela Bassett is the prodigal daughter who comes back to face her past and have a confrontation with her mother . Mary Alice plays her role of the mother with such dignity that we see right through this mother the hurt and disappointment her daughter has caused in her life . It's a joy to see both of these actresses play their parts in such a restrained manner . There are no hysterics between them , just the bitterness caused by events fate has dealt them . The rest of the cast is wonderful . Mary Steenburgen , Ralph Waite , Jane Alexander , Bill Cobbs are all perfectly cast for their roles . Again , Mr . Sayles has given us a slice of life , and in doing so , he has tackled the task with great panache .
555968	1406078	91217	10.0	That championship season	David Anspaugh's " Hoosiers " is a film about the passion to excel in sports . It's also about a man's comeback to the game after a rough patch in his own life . " Hoosiers " is a timeless film that will look good after years of its release because it speaks to us about how someone can inspire a group of people to do their best , as they become confident in what they are trying to accomplish . The film was lovingly written for the screen by Angelo Pizzo . Coach Norman Dale gets a reprieve in life when he is hired to coach the Hickory basket ball team in rural Indiana . Basketball is the game where most people in that state take an unusual interest . Their passion for the sport is evident . The new coach is looked with suspicion because he is an outsider and he believes in teamwork . He wants everyone to participate equally , which doesn't make for excitement in the court . The coach doesn't want anyone overshadowing another , that's why he insists in total involvement . Needless to say , his method clashes with the parents and towns people from the start . The coach's past comes to haunt him when Myra Fleener , one of the teachers , discovers an article that reveals an incident Mr . Dale would like to forget . At the same time , Myra realizes the goodness in the coach's heart by involving the drunken Shooter into helping him with the team . Gene Hackman has one of the best opportunities of his distinguished career with his portrayal of Coach Dale . He is splendid in the film and he wins us with his decency and by sticking to his principles , which he passes on to the team members . Barbara Hershey is also good as Myra , the young woman who falls in love with Dale . Dennis Hopper plays Shooter , the father of one of the kids in the team who has a drinking problem . " Hoosiers " is an inspiring film that ought to be seen by young people because of its message about team spirit and how to interact with one another in peace and harmony .
556020	1406078	347149	10.0	Hayao Miyazaki casts his spell on us	The genius of Anime films , Hayao Miyazaki , shows why he is one of an absolute masters of the genre . Taking Diana Wynne Jones ' story " Howl's Moving Castle " and creating the magnificent film for our delight , is something that no other man could have accomplished with as much flair and panache as Mr . Miyazaki has done . The film has such a great look that at times we wonder if one is really seeing an animated film , or not . The images we watch on the screen have such detailed and rich look that we wonder how did Mr . Miyasaki could have accomplished it . Not having seen the Japanese version , the English one that was released here offers great voices to go along with the many characters in the film . The big surprise was Jean Simmons , an actress we haven't see much lately who does a great job with the older Sophie . As the young Sophie , Emily Mortimes is wonderful and her voice suits the character so well . It was also a stroke of genius to have cast Lauren Bacall as the Witch of the Waste , as she seems to be having a great time acting her . Billy Crystal was delightful as Calcifer and Josh Hutcherson is perfect as Markl . Christian Bale is an amazing Howl . In minor roles we hear the voices of Blythe Danner , Crisping Freeman and Jena Malone , among others . This Anime film will delight young and old fans of Hayao Miyazaki who can look forward to a great time at the movies with this film .
555116	1406078	104597	10.0	An extraordinary life	We never saw this documentary when it came out . In a tribute to Katherine Hepburn , TCM showed it , as part of the daily festivity . Director David Heeley , who also co-wrote the material with Ms . Hepburn , clearly demonstrate an impeccable taste in what he carefully picked to show us . Katherine Hepburn was a woman ahead of her times . She had a sense of self and her own style , something that came to her naturally . Ms . Hepburn was an actress who knew what seemed to suit her talent as we witness in all the movies she graced with her presence . We are given clips from her films , as well as a tour of her Connecticut home and her surroundings . Also , in the documentary , we see some comments by her peers that speak volumes as to what extent she was admired by the people that came in contact with her . And , yes , she was opinionated , and didn't care to express her views , as she stuck by her principles . Yes , it certainly was a privileged life .
556516	1406078	36244	10.0	Posse mentality	" The Ox-Bow Incident " is a film that parallels the times we are living in many ways . Darryl Zanuck probably didn't even think much of this project that has proved to be a film admired by a lot of people that find in it , something that resonates with them . William Wellman , the director , made an excellent film out of the adaptation by Lamar Trotti , of the Walter van Tilburg Clark's novel . The film , only 75 minutes long , packs a lot in a short period , something that other films , twice as long , fail to deliver . Arthur C . Miller's cinematography is an asset for the picture . This film brought to mind another Henry Fonda film : " 12 Angry Men " , in which a more or less posse is trying to decide the fate of a young man accused of committing a heinous crime . In this film , we get a similar idea , in that the mob group that is formed will end up bringing the wrong kind of justice to the three unfortunate men that are deemed guilty and will be lynched ; for all practical purposes these men would be proved innocent in a real court of justice . Henry Fonda does an excellent job as Gil Carter . The biggest surprise though is the then unknown Dana Andrews , one of the men that is made to pay for a crime he didn't commit . Also , this is an early film in which Anthony Quinn appeared as one of the doomed men . The director got marvelous acting in general from the supporting cast , notably , Frank Conroy , William Eythe , Jane Darwell and Mary Beth Hughes . This is a classic film to be treasured .
555251	1406078	257360	10.0	As good as he gets !	The Warren Schmidt of Jack Nicholson is a man who has lived all his life in a fog . Even as he is ready to retire at the beginning of the film , it appears that life went through him , but he never had a life . Alexander Payne has created a portrait of a mediocre man who , might be living in Omaha , but for all practical purposes , he might be living in Mars ! . Does he ever know his wife ? Even though they've been married for 42 years , they are at different wave lengths . How about his daughter ? . This girl is a selfish creature who only cares about her own wedding plans that might be shattered . Helen Schmidt , Warren's wife , has made a home for her family , but did she ever understand this man ? For that matter , did Warren realize that he had a wife and built-in maid all in one ? Like in all marriages , there are annoying things that Helen did that Warren resents . She is a typical house wife from the old school and values in an ever changing world . Warren , being in his own world , discovers a dark secret that challenges the happy memory of Helen . It's very hard to conceive this Schmidt without Jack Nicholoson . This might be his greatest achievement of a distinguished career . He is pure perfection as this man who goes in search of himself and to reconnect with a daughter that couldn't care less about him . Visiting his daughter's future family , the Herzels , Warren's world collapses around him . After all , he and Helen lived normal lives . Being a guest in Roberta's house proves to be too much for him . Kathy Bates is , without a doubt , right on the money with her portrayal of Roberta Herzel . Just look at her around the dinner table to realize how good an actress she is . The rest of the cast is excellent . Hope Davis as the daughter brings the right amount of selfishness to her Jeannie Schmidt . We have known people like her . Her role is typical of many a bride who wants to have a full wedding from parents like hers . Dermot Mulroney is very effective as the groom . He's as creepy as his hairdo . He and Jeannie will probably end up in divorce in a few years , but she will have the album , the videos and the party to remember her fifteen minutes of fame in Denver . For Jack Nicholson watchers , just wait for the last sequence of the film after he gets home to understand we are watching is a lesson in acting . Warren Schmidt at last connects with reality in a manner that only this great actor only could .
556481	1406078	492506	10.0	Playing with words	This delightful documentary , directed by Patrick Creadon , is a dream come true for people that enjoy to solve crossword puzzles . It centers around Will Shortz , the current New York Times editor , who has revolutionized the way we do the puzzles today . The film was co-written by Christine O'Malley , who with the director , takes us to meet some of the people behind the scenes . We must make a confession from the start , we are one of those addicted to solving the daily crosswords in the paper . The New York Times puzzles are the best of all the ones published by any newspaper . Of course , we are not in the league of the likes of Tyler Hinman , Trip Payne , or Al Sanders , who were the three finalist in the 2005 competition , but we are happy with just the idea of solving them every morning . There are many personalities that speak about their addiction to the crosswords of the New York Times . Among them , we hear from former President Bill Clinton , a man that has always been notorious for his quick mind . David Okrent , the former public editor of the Times , makes a surprise appearance . Jon Stewart is also funny in the way he deals with clues and how he blames Will Shortz when he doesn't get them . Mike Mussina , The Indigo Girls , Bob Dole , and other celebrities also are seen . The great fun of " Wordplay " is watching a master constructor of the stature of Merl Reagle creating a daily crossword right in front of the camera , and explaining the logic behind it . There is a funny moment when Ellen Ripstein , a former winner , tells us that in spite of having won , she keeps going every year to participate in the tournament . Her performance in the entertainment part of the competition brings a light and goofy moment to the film . The only thing we don't get too much of is the master himself . Will Shortz appears all too briefly as the emphasis of the documentary seems to be the annual competition at the Marriott in Stamford . Some of Mr . Shortz observations are funny , especially when he shares his typical weekly correspondence from frustrated people that are " puzzled " by his clues . " Wordplay " is a film that will resonate more with crossword puzzle lovers , but it is a fun movie to sit through because the witty material and the pace it was given by its creators .
555912	1406078	404030	10.0	The collector	If anyone has any doubts about the talent of Liev Schrieber , just a look at his new film , " Everything is Illuminated " , which clearly shows a man that is not only one of America's finest actors , but a new director whose first effort is indeed an inspiration and a harbinger of what is to follow . Mr . Schreiber has adapted the novel by Jonathan Safran Foer into a film that will live forever because of the way the director has adapted the material . The film clearly surpassed our expectations since we had no preconceived ideas . For those who haven't watched the film , perhaps you should stop reading here . Jonathan is a collector . His love for his grandparents is boundless . He watches as his grandfather dies and as his grandmother is on what appears to be her death bed . On a clear moment , this dying woman gives Jonathan a picture and an amber ornament for his collection . Watching the photograph , taken a long time ago , a young couple are seen together . Watching makes Jonathan think it shows the grandfather and his girlfriend , taken on happier times . Watching the snapshot seems to be the motivation for this intense young man to go looking for his ancestors ' past in the Ukraine . Jonathan has made arrangements with a travel agency , Heritage Tours , of Odessa for his trip to Trochenbrod , the mythical place where his grandfather came from . The agency is handled by an older man , who claims to be blind , and his grandson , Alex , a man who loves the pop American culture that has captured his imagination , as well as his contemporaries in the country . Alex speaks a kind of English no one speaks and his conversation and translation , for Jonathan's benefit are hilarious to our ear for the use of sometimes unheard English terms . The old man insists in taking his dog , Sammy Davis Jr . , against the wishes of Jonathan , who doesn't want to sit next to the snarling and barking animal during the trip . As they embark in search of Trochenbrod , it's clearly that his companions , especially the old man has no clue where he is going . At this point , the film becomes a road movie , as the three characters riding the back roads of the country become more acquainted with one another . As the trio arrive at the sunflower field with the house at the end , it indicates they have indeed come to the right place . Some places are a clear reminder of the conflicts of the past . The older woman , living in the isolated place , is the missing link of the story . She is able to put things into the right perspective . But here is where the story changes its emphasis from Jonathan , who clearly has come to the land of his ancestors , to the old man . We watch as this older man starts remembering things about himself . This , in turn , changes the dynamic of the film as we discover how connected Jonathan and his guides have been all the time . Some criticism in these pages have expressed opinions about the accuracy of the story , which after all , it's a work of fiction and liberties have been taken . It would have been impossible to make another film including so much that is contained in the book . The great way the film is divided into different chapters is a clever way to let the viewer know what's about to be seen . Elijah Wood , a magnificent film actor , does an excellent work by underplaying Jonathan . Mr . Wood makes one of his best appearances in any film with his interpretation of the main character . The felicitous casting of Eugene Hutz as Alex , the Ukranian tour assistant and translator , seems to be an idea made in heaven . Mr . Hutz is about the best thing in the film . His arcane usage of English gives the film a funny angle that delights the viewer . Boris Leskin as Alex's grandfather and driver of the tour car makes a valuable contribution to the film , as well as Laryssa Lauret , who is seen in the last part of the movie . The excellent cinematography of Matthew Libatique brings the splendor of the Czech Republic's countryside in all its magnificence . The musical score by Paul Cantelon is heard in the background adorning the film in ways that it adds a richness to the movie . Above all , this is a triumph for Liev Schreiber , the first time director that will surely go far in whatever he decides to do next .
555758	1406078	296166	10.0	No nonsense women !	I once read about an audition of models for an Armani fashion show . It appears the Milanese designer was rejecting everyone because he thought they were too fat to carry his clothes the way he intended . If anyone reading this comment is friendly with Giorgio , please advise him to avoid seeing this film . He's liable to have a series of strokes , or even a fatal heart attack ! What Patricia Cardoso has achieved with this film is to clarify for us that indeed , beauty is in the eye of the beholder , and that we should not judge the person by the image they project . What might be considered fat and ugly for the same media that only glorify the skinny people that populate the pages of the different fashion magazines , for someone else will be beautiful . America Ferrera is a revelation . She exudes sweetness and the performance is right on the money . Her dreams to get out of the mediocrity of the factory life her mother wants for her are to be applauded because she has the smarts to make a career for herself and go to college . The great Lupe Ontiveros plays the mother . It's a shame that this actress haven't been discovered by more directors that will employ her talents in the way she deserves . She can bring so much to a film as proved in other independent films where she has appeared . Wherever she appears one can expect the very best from her . The rest of the cast is very good . We shall be looking forward to Ms . Cardoso's next venture with the confidence that whatever she undertakes it will be a fun time at the movies .
554857	1406078	40636	10.0	Some of the eight million stories of New York City	Not having seen " The Naked City " in quite some time , the opportunity of watching it again was a pleasure , when TCM showed it last night . This satisfying 1948 film brings us back to the way New York , and especially Manhattan looked at that time . The Lower East Side , especially , in all its chaotic splendor offers a nostalgic look to our past . It took the genius of Jules Dassin to see the opportunities for bringing this story by Malvin Wald to the screen . Albert Maltz worked on the screen play with Mr . Wald and the result is a movie that shows the diverse culture of the city . Although the film is about crime in New York City , there are aspects of it that shows how most of what we see is interconnected . This film was the basis for a successful , and innovative television series that showed a different crime story every week and how the NYPD dealt with solving the cases . The film starts with a drunk being knocked out and thrown into the river . A woman is discovered dead in her bathtub by her maid . It's determined chloroform was involved in her death . Enter Lt . Muldoon , whose precinct gets involved in the investigation . Muldoon and his right hand man , Det . Jimmy Halleran , also find out jewelry is missing . The dead woman Jean Dexter , a fashion model , leads the police to a Dr . Stoneman , a man that loved her . At the same time , another detective discovers a cigarette case that points to another man , Frank Niles , who also appears to be involved . The drunk in the river was a jewelry thief and he , in turn , points to Harmonica Willie , a tough guy with a criminal record . All the elements come together in a great finale that involves a chase on the Williamsburg bridge . Jules Dassin decided to bring his cameras to the streets showing what a real New York looked like and got an excellent performance from most of the people that had no idea they were providing themselves as extras for the film . William Daniels , Greta Garbo's favorite cameraman , and distinguished a director himself , photographed the city in all its glory . All the principals do an excellent work in the film . Barry Fitzgerald as Lt . Muldoon shows in fine form . Don Taylor plays Jimmy Halleran . A fine performance from a young Howard Duff , as Frank Niles , is one of the best things in the picture . Ted DeCorsia is seen as a criminal who loves to keep in shape and play his harmonica . But what made the film fun for this viewer are the uncredited faces in the picture . We spotted Paul Ford , John Randolph , Nehemiah Persoff , Molly Picon , David Opatashu , and other character actors of that era . It says a lot about their generosity in appearing without being mentioned , something that today would appear unimaginable . Credit must go to Jules Dassin for this enormously satisfying movie !
556495	1406078	227277	10.0	Angel and Nene	Marcelo Pineyro , one of the best directors from Argentina , surprises with every new effort . Working on this film with Marcelo Figueras , he also contributed to bring Ricardo Piglia's novel to the screen with unexpected results . The novel was based on a real criminal case that happened in Buenos Aires in the 1960's . The two men at the center of the story are gay lovers who happened to be criminals . These two men share a passion that comes across on the screen like no other in recent memory . Angel , the Spaniard , wants to go to New York and Nene , his lover , wants to comply , but first they must attend to the assault of a vehicle that brings money to one bank . During the heist Angel is shot on his shoulder . Things are so hot for all the people involved , they flee to Uruguay . This was perhaps a miscalculation , because they are being followed by the Argentine police , that is working with local authorities in apprehending all the criminals . Nene is restless . He decides to leave the safe house , and finds Giselle , a beautiful woman who falls in love with him . At this point , we are of two minds , is Nene really cheating on Angel , or is he trying to use Giselle into providing another place where they can hide ? The violent end comes in a finale that doesn't have anything to envy to any other movies of the genre . The best thing in the film are the two leads . Leonardo Sbaraglia is one of the best actors that have come out of Argentina lately . He does an amazing job in portraying Nene . Eduardo Noriega , is also a Spanish actor that has done excellent work before and he shows his range in a magnificent performance as Angel . Leticia Bredice is Giselle , the young woman in Montevideo who befriends , then fall in love with Nene . The film proves Marcelo Pineyro is a voice to be reckoned with and who has an enormous talent for giving his audience his best .
