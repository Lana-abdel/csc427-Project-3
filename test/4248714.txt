571420	4248714	95882	1.0	Police Academy 5 : Assignment Miami Beach	As with the previous three sequels , this one is no different , the first is still the best , and there are pretty much no moments that make you laugh . Basically head of the police academy Cmndt . Eric Lassard ( George Gaynes ) has reached retirement age , to the delight of Capt . Thaddeus Harris ( G . W . Bailey ) , planning to take over his job , but not before Lassard receiver a prestigious lifetime award in Miami , Florida . Accompanying Lassard ( and Harris ) are ex-graduates Sgt . Moses Hightower ( Bubba Smith ) , Sgt . Larvelle Jones ( Michael Winslow ) , Sgt . Eugene Tackleberry ( David Graf ) , Lt . Debbie Callahan ( Leslie Easterbrook ) and Sgt . Laverne Hooks ( Marion Ramsey ) . Unfortunately in the arrivals of the airport , Lassard accidentally swapped his bag with some criminals for an identical bag containing a container of diamonds . After a while of trying to find the bag the bad guys eventually kidnap Lassard , and demand the academy help them get away . Also starring Janet Jones as Kate Stratton , Lance Kinsey as Lt . Proctor , Matt McCoy as Sgt . Nick Lassard , Ren√© Auberjonois as Tony Stark , George R . Robertson as Commissioner Hurst , Tab Thacker as Officer Thomas ' House ' Conklin , Archie Hahn as Mouse , James Hampton as Mayor of Miami and Jerry Lazarus as Sugar . Steve Guttenberg said a firm " no " to being in this or any other sequels that may ( and did ) follow , good choice , this is probably the worst of the sequels , not even the self-made sound effects of Winslow can save it , nothing to laugh at , lovable characters not doing anything exciting , just a complete waste of time . Poor !
571231	4248714	113540	1.0	Kids	I don't remember much of this film , apart from that I found it one of the most awful and boring films ever . Also , I do not know any of the actors , apart from Jon Abrahams as Steven ; and I do remember a character called Casper , because they called him the " friendly ghost " . I did have to watch it in College class once , and I remembered the moment of the mother breast feeding . The moment I didn't remember though was probably the only interesting , funny and watchable of the whole film I remember , one of the kids dips a tampon in his drink , and he sucks the liquid out of it , as it isn't dripping . Anyway , I still have not changed my opinion of it , even after the brief viewing in College , and only the critics think it is good , I didn't . The director Larry Clark was nominated the Golden Palm at the Cannes Film Festival . Poor !
572870	4248714	69768	1.0	Battle for the Planet of the Apes	I had a feeling before I watched this that I would be confused because I should see the films in order , but to be honest , I don't think it matters either way , it is a rubbish film . Basically Caesar ( Roddy McDowall ) , son of Cornelius and Zira ( they had in Escape from . . . ) has grown up and become leader of the apes , and after surviving the Conquest for . . . , he wants to see his parents . MacDonald ( Austin Stoker ) has the idea to go to the forbidden city , where a bomb hit , where there may be tapes that have survived . They don't realise though that there are survivors , human mutants , and the battle of the film is obviously against them . I saw a couple of the gun fights and explosions , but the make-up is less convincing than it used to be , the dialogue is a bit ridiculous , and none of the big actors or ( cheap ) production by Frank Capra Jr . can save it . Also starring Claude Akins as General Aldo , Natalie Trundy as Lisa , Severn Darden as Governor Kolp , Lew Ayres as Mandemus , introducing Paul Williams as Prof . Virgil , John Huston as The Lawgiver , Noah Keen as Abe the Teacher , Richard Eastham as Mutant Captain , Michael Stearns as Jake and John Landis as Jake's Friend . I did fall asleep a little towards the end , but who cares . I have only seen the first and Escape from . . . , and they are meant to be the best ones , so it is better to just watch them , I haven't see the other two yet ( Beneath . . . and Conquest of . . . ) , and until I do , I won't understand what's going on in this one , and still consider it a complete piece of crap . Well , I'm sure I'll still have that opinion even when I have seen them all in the right order . Poor !
572413	4248714	79641	1.0	Nosferatu , the Vampyre	A stupid film with stupid acting and stupid moments that are meant to be scary , but they aren't . There's nobody I know in it but the guy who plays Count Dracula ( or Nosferatu ) is rubbish and is hardly terrifying at all . All the other actors are just as bad trying to convince you that they are either being stalked , killed or having their blood sucked from them . I have included this on my worst films list because it made me nod off many times when it was meant to be a scary moment . All that happened was that he stuck his " fangs " out , and that's pretty much it . Ooh , scary , NOT ! So trust me , don't bother seeing it unless you have problems sleeping , this is a film that will definitely help you . Poor !
571399	4248714	52077	1.0	Plan 9 from Outer Space	I mainly knew of this film for two reasons , being re-created in the Tim Burton biography Ed Wood , and for being considered one of the worst films ever made , from possibly the worst ever film director Edward D . Wood , Jr . Basically aliens ( originally coming in peace ) are commencing Plan 9 , resurrecting the dead and attacking to destroy the living / human race . That's it . Starring Gregory Walcott as Jeff Trent , Bela Lugosi ( in archive footage ) as Ghoul Man , Mona McKinnon as Paula Trent , Duke Moore as Lt . John Harper , Tom Keene as Col . Tom Edwards , Vampira as Vampire / Ghoul Girl , Lyle Talbot as General Roberts , and narrated ( along with introduction and end speech ) by Criswell . This film was not deliberately made to be humorous , it was just very , VERY , low budget , and with so many mistakes to see and hear , how can you not giggle ? Wobbly toy flying saucers on visible strings with shadows appearing in backgrounds , camp costumes for the human-looking aliens , Legosi being dead replaced by a lookalike ( eyes only ) always covering his face with a cape , ridiculous dialogue when it's not needed , the list goes on . It may be popular for cult audiences , but I think the only reason to see it is for a bit of humour , and the better choice would be Ed Wood . Poor !
572851	4248714	205461	1.0	Thomas and the Magic Railroad	I used to love the TV series as a kid , I almost never missed it , so I decided to see this film both to see if there was any resemblance , and why the critics hate it , from director Britt Allcroft ( who created the show ) . Basically the supply of gold dust , for travel between Shining Time and the island of Sodor , is running out for Mr . Conductor ( Alec Baldwin ) . It doesn't help when Thomas the Tank Engine ( Edward Glen ) and friends are being attacked by the nasty Diesel 10 ( Neil Crone ) , who also wants to find the missing train Lady ( Allcroft ) and the Magic Railroad it runs on . Trying to help the situation are Mr . C's slacker cousin ( Michael E . Rodgers ) , new friend Lily ( slightly deeper voiced Mara Wilson ) , and her grandpa Burnett Stone ( Peter Fonda ) , who has lost his belief in the magic of Lady . That's about it . Also starring Cody McMains as Patch , Grease's Didi Conn as Stacy Jones , Crone as Gordon , Colm Feore as Toby , Linda Ballantyne as Percy , Kevin Frank as Bertie the Bus , Harold the Helicopter and Henry , Susan Roman as James and Shelley Skinner as Annie and Clarabel . No Fat Controller ! ? Maybe if Ringo Starr or Michael Angelis had returned to do all the characters voice , it could have improved it the tiniest bit . Then again , nothing can improve the ridiculous story , the stupid acting , the dreadful songs , and the feel that it is nothing like the TV series , even if it looks the same , it's just one of the worst TV adaptations ever . Very poor !
572296	4248714	87078	2.0	Conan the Destroyer	I heard that the original film , Conan the Barbarian , was meant to be a pretty good film , especially for Arnold Schwarzenegger starting his career . I think this was Schwarzenegger's second or third film after the good success of The Terminator , but it is not one that goes in his greatest films list . Conan is on a really weird mission to become king or something . He is accompanied by a load of people to help him " destroy " something . One person includes a boyish looking ( as always ) Grace Jones as Zula . The story is pretty rubbish , I can'r remember seeing any decent fight scenes , and Schwarzenegger is a lot better in The Terminator , being evil . Pretty poor , as far as I remember !
572001	4248714	277434	4.0	We Were Soldiers	Based on a true story , a book called We Were Soldiers Once . . . and Young , this is quite an intriguing war film . Someone in a documentary about the film said that nearly all war films are not accurate , so director Randall Wallace stars as Lt . Col . Hal Moore and leads a bunch of recruits to the battle of Vietnam . You can see in this film why the Vietnam war was not only one of the biggest , but mainly one of the most unpopular , e . g . because of the amount of violence . The moments that mainly stick out are obviously the war , but also the letters to family and deaths of close friends . Also starring Madeleine Stowe as Julie Moore , Greg Kinnear as Maj . Bruce ' Snake ' Crandall , Sam Elliott as Sgt . Maj . Basil Plumley , American Pie's Chris Klein as 2nd Lt . Jack Geoghegan , Keri Russell as Barbara Geoghegan and Saving Private Ryan's Barry Pepper as Joe Galloway . Okay !
571780	4248714	427229	4.0	Failure to Launch	From the short advert I saw for this film , I was something different , but it still turned out okay . Basically 35 year old slacker Tripp ( Matthew McConaughey ) hasn't been able to keep a relationship going , because he is still living with his parents , Sue ( an underused Kathy Bates ) and Al ( Terry Bradshaw ) , along with his friends . Along comes Paula ( Sarah Jessica Parker ) , and instantly finds herself getting close to Tripp , but it actually turns out , she's paid for this by the parents , so he can learn to be independent and move out . She does almost anything to make sure he's going to stick with her , e . g . pretend to have a dog that is being put to sleep ( not for real of course ) , but she has a rule of never having sex with a " client " . It's only when he is planning to break up with Paula that she breaks this rule the one time , and unfortunately , it turns out she might be falling for him for real . It's obvious that he was eventually going to find out about her " work " , but he realises she really does have feeling for him and they obviously close the film with a loving kiss . Oh , there is also a pretty small subplot where Paula's friend Kit ( Elf's Zooey Deschanel ) is trying to shut an annoying mockingbird up , and the guy she got to help she is falling for . Also starring Justin Bartha as Ace , Bradley Cooper as Demo , Adam Alexi-Malle as Mr . Axelrod , Tyrel Jackson Williams as Jeffrey , Katheryn Winnick as Melissa and Heroes ' Stephen Tobolowsky as Bud . McConaughey isn't bad as the slacker , Parker has her moments , Bates doesn't do enough to shine in a small part , and the slapstick jokes , particularly being hit and bitten by things gets repetitive , but I suppose it's not bad . Okay !
573012	4248714	118172	4.0	The Wind in the Willows	I have seen many versions of the famous Kenneth Grahame classic story , too many in fact , and this was the very first live action version . You probably already know the story , but this one has had a few changes made so it is a bit more exciting , but not too much . Mole ( Steve Coogan ) is painting his wall when suddenly his home starts to collapse and he runs away to find the river , and Rat ( Eric Idle ) . They go to Toad ( Terry Jones , also directing ) at Toad Hall to find out that Weasels from the Wild Wood have bought the meadow where Mole's home was , it was Toad's father's meadow . They soon meet up with Badger ( Nicol Williamson ) and try to erase Toad's warped mind of motor cars . Later in the film you find out more from the Chief Weasel ( Antony Sher ) that he wants to turn Toad Hall into a slaughter house , and there is a new Dog Food Factory in the meadow . Apart from the small changes made , the story is still the same . Also starring John Cleese as Mr . Toad's Lawyer , Stephen Fry as The Judge , Bernard Hill as The Engine Driver , Michael Palin ( also in the Rik Mayall cartoon version ) as The Sun , Chicken Run's Julia Sawalha as The Jailer's Daughter and Victoria Wood as The Tea Lady . Okay , mainly for the kids !
571375	4248714	157583	4.0	Enigma	I was quite interested in the theme of this film , involving one of the biggest parts of World War II , and the actors in it , and the result wasn't too bad . Basically during this war many Nazi U-boats used Enigma Codes to send secret messages , possibly their plans and stuff , and Britain's code-breaking centre didn't have long to crack it . The authorities enlist the help of a brilliant young man , Thomas Jericho ( Dougray Scott ) , who is a genius in the field of puzzle solving , or whatever he normally does . With this code-breaking job , Tom also has the trouble of tracking down the woman he had quite a thing for , Claire ( Saffron Burrows ) , who has disappeared , and he suspects of being allied with the enemy . To help him with the mysteries , he recruits Claire's best friend , Hester Wallace ( Kate Winslet ) , and together they discover quite a few betrayals , more importantly from Wigram ( Jeremy Northam ) . Also starring Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau as " Puck " Pukowski , Tom Hollander as Logie , Donald Sumpter as Leveret , Matthew Macfadyen as Cave and Corin Redgrave as Admiral Trowbridge . You really need to pay attention to this film to understand what is going on , but what I did wasn't too bad . It was number 66 on The 100 Greatest War Films . Okay !
571520	4248714	299079	5.0	Pandora Peaks	I bought this on DVD because I was expecting to have good moments with a large breasted woman , and it does ! This documentary directed by the late great Russ Meyer basically shows how he thinks , especially about the actress with the boobs of his dreams , Pandora Peaks . I have only ever watched this the once to see what it was like , and to be honest it is a bit repetitive with dialogue . I am just giving it quite a high mark for the amount of great nudity . But when I did watch it , I found Meyer a bit weird , German actress Tundi was a bit obsessive about her image and her large breasts , and the other girls Leasha and Candy Samples hardly did anything . Great for the nudity , okay for the entire film !
573029	4248714	337921	5.0	Cellular	From director David R . Ellis ( Final Destination 2 ) , this may not be the most tense film I've ever seen , but it's got just enough good stuff . Basically science teacher Jessica Martin ( Kim Basinger ) is kidnapped by Ethan Greer ( Jason Statham ) and his thugs , and she has been locked in a room , and Ethan made sure to smash the phone . She manages to get most of the phone back together , and she clicks the wires to find a caller . She finds one in slacker Ryan ( Fantastic Four's Chris Evans ) , who of course thinks it's a joke at first when she mentions kidnap and wanting the police , but when he hears the commotion he's willing to do whatever it takes to help her out . With Jessica on the phone , Ryan goes to try and help Jessica's husband and son , but obviously he is too late for both . The bad guys basically want something from the husband's safe , a video camera with incriminating footage of a robbery or something , with Ethan and other fake cops , including Jack Tanner ( The Truman Show's Noah Emmerich ) . Oh , also after Bryan and / or the bad guys is Sgt . Bob Mooney ( William H . Macy ) , who Bryan gave the phone to for a brief moment . Also starring Eric Christian Olsen as Chad , Jessica Biel as Chloe , Brendan Kelly as Mad Dog and Richard Burgi as Craig Martin . Even in a thriller type film there is room for little giggles , and there are , yes Statham is a bit of a dry villain , and it is quite similar to the " stay on line " aspect as Phone Booth , but the chases , gun play and performances by Basinger , Evans and always reliable Macy are to enjoy . Worth watching !
573053	4248714	136640	5.0	The Forgotten Toys	If you've seen the mini Christmas movie then you would know what this is , it's basically a TV series about the teddy bear and doll still on the lookout for new kids to be owners . Joanna Lumley is still the okay Annie ( or " Pigtails " to Teddy ) the doll with her ragged skirt , and Bob Hoskins is still the lovable and humorous Teddy . Throughout the series they had many interesting adventures . They tried to be won at a fayre , they caught some burglars , they were stolen by a horrible kid and many more . To be honest I didn't watch it all the time , but when I did it was pretty okay . Bob Hoskins as Teddy is just the best part of the whole show . Worth watching !
571214	4248714	122718	5.0	Small Soldiers	This is quite an interesting idea , toys that can play back , or rather go completely wrong , not be stopped and create chaos , from director Joe Dante ( Gremlins ) . Basically Irwin Wayfair ( Scary Movie 2's David Cross ) and Larry Benson ( Cherry Falls ' Jay Mohr ) pitch ideas to Hartland / Globotech boss Gil Mars ( Denis Leary ) , and he creates the toys that can play with kids and run forever . These are The Commando Elite and The Gorgonites ( the Small Soldiers ) with the slogan " Everything else is just a toy " . Unfortunately these toys break out and create a war , and only Alan Abernathy ( Gregory Smith ) and his love interest Christy Fimple ( Kirsten Dunst ) , with the help of The Gorgonites , lead by Archer ( Frank Langella ) , can stop the really mean Commando Elite , lead by Chip Hazzard ( Tommy Lee Jones ) . Also starring Ann Magnuson as Irene Abernathy , The Simpsons ' Phil Hartman as Phil Fimple , Ernest Borgnine as Kip Killagin , Jim Brown as Butch Meathook , Bruce Dern as Link Static , George Kennedy as Brick Bazooka , Clint Walker as Nick Nitro , This Is Spinal Tap's : Christopher Guest as Slamfist and Scratch-It , Michael McKean as Insaniac and Freakenstein and Harry Shearer as Punch-It , Sarah Michelle Gellar and Christina Ricci as Gwendy doll , and Scary Movie's Cheri Oteri as Globotech Telephone Operator . Worth watching !
571935	4248714	83944	5.0	Rambo : First Blood	With the release of the fourth film in 2008 , simply titled " Rambo " ( " John Rambo " in America ) it was right they should show all three of the original films , and this is the first . Basically John J . Rambo ( Sylvester Stallone , also writing ) is a mentally unstable Vietnam war veteran , who has come to a quiet little town to see an old war friend , but he finds out he's dead . When he walks through a not-to-far mountain town , Sheriff Will Teasle ( Brian Dennehy ) gives him a lift to the end of town , and tells him to leave , but Rambo ignores him and is arrested for vagrancy ( being a tramp ) . As the cops try to make him go through the arrest procedures , he eventually breaks out in rage and manages to escape . Teasle and the many officers are now hot on his trail , but they also meet the man that knows Rambo best , Colonel Samuel Trautman ( Richard Crenna ) who personally trained to be the best . There are many explosions and quite a lot of gun fire as loner pushed too far tries to end and get away from this " warfare " , but in the end he gives up and goes to prison . Also starring David Caruso as Deputy Mitch , Jack Starrett as Deputy Sgt . Arthur Galt , Michael Talbott as Deputy Balford , Bill McKinney as State Police Capt . Dave Kern and Chris Mulkey as Deputy Ward . To be honest , this wasn't the film I was expecting or had in mind , I found it just a little random and pointless , even though it is fun to see Stallone bleeding a lot , firing and blowing stuff up , but I don't know who's side to be on , and is Rambo a hero or anti-hero ? Nevertheless , worth watching !
572368	4248714	303714	5.0	Barbershop	I don't get to see a nearly all black actor filled film , and this one wasn't too bad , from director Tim Story ( Fantastic Four ) . Basically it is a day in the life of a barbershop on the south side of Chicago . Calvin Palmer ( Ice Cube ) inherited the struggling business from his deceased father , and with an ambition to do other things , he sells it local loan shark Lester Wallace ( Keith David ) . Slowly though he realises his mistake , and Wallace instead of taking back his money wants double , so Calvin is pretty sure his barbershop will have to close it's doors . He can either convince Wallace to forget the debt , or raise it , Eddie ( Cedric the Entertainer ) who has been there since it opened is determined Calvin can # t and won't sell it . There is also a slapstick filled subplot where J . D . ( Anthony Anderson ) has stolen a cash dispenser and is trying to find a good place to hide it , and before the end it ends up at the barbershop , where Calvin can collect a reward for returning it . Also starring Sean Patrick Thomas as Jimmy James , Eve as Terri Jones , Troy Garity as Isaac Rosenberg , Michael Ealy as Ricky Nash and Leonard Earl Howze as Dinka . The film is filled with black stereotypes , and there are moments where you really have to listen to understand what they are saying , but it amusing . Worth watching !
571705	4248714	65377	5.0	Airport	From director George Seaton ( the original Miracle on 34th Street ) , you can't really watch this film without thinking about Airplane ! which spoofed moments of it very well . Basically it all takes place in an airport ( duh ! ) , and it sees many characters getting on with whatever they do in airports . These include airport manager Mel Bakersfeld ( Birdman of Alcatraz's Burt Lancaster ) , plane pilot Capt . Vernon Demerest ( Dean Martin ) , and constant plane stowaway Ada Quonsett ( Oscar winning Helen Hayes ) . There is a lot of chat for a while , but the disaster movie element really kicks off after the plane of the film has taken off . Mrs . Quonsett is discovered to be a stowaway , but instead of punishing her , they instead get her to help get a man out of his seat . This man is a bomber , carrying an explosive in a briefcase , and just after trying to be convinced to give it to Demerest , the man locks himself in the toilet , and blows himself up . Luckily , the plane stays in the air after a few seconds of cabin pressure , and all they have to do now is land the plane safely . Also starring Jean Seberg as Tanya Livingston , Jacqueline Bisset as Gwen Meighen , Golden Globe nominated George Kennedy as Joe Patroni , Van Heflin as D . O . Guerrero ; Golden Globe winning , and Oscar and BAFTA nominated Maureen Stapleton as Inez Guerrero , Barry Nelson as Capt . Anson Harris , Dana Wynter as Cindy Bakersfeld , Lloyd Nolan as Harry Standish , Barbara Hale as Sarah Bakersfeld Demerest and Gary Collins as Cy Jordan . The only good bit of the film is the bomber explosion on the plane , the rest of it is just too chatty for it's own good , but I suppose you could try it , but Airplane ! is much more entertaining . It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration , Best Cinematography , Best Costume Design , Best Film Editing , Best Music for Alfred Newman , Sound , Best Writing , Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium for Seaton and Best Picture , and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Original Score . Worth watching , at least once !
572326	4248714	65421	5.0	The Aristocats	I can remember seeing it only once when I was a kid , it was pretty good . It was the animated Walt Disney Pictures film with cats as the stars . Duchess is a white cat living with a rich woman with her three kittens . One day they are kidnapped by the greedy butler ( for their fortune ) . The butler fails to get to his location and the cats are now lost . Luckily , Omalli ( voiced by Jungle Book's Baloo , Phil Harris ) finds them and starts leading them to a place with food and safety , where his band is living . This band includes the cool Scat Cat , Omalli's best friend . A good film with some adventure and some good cartoon animation . Good !
572580	4248714	986214	5.0	Animal Farm	It should be mentioned first that the farm in the programmes does not exist and is fake , but all animal and plants shown from the many laboratories and facilities are real . Basically in three episodes food critic Giles Coren ( he hosted Channel 5's Movie Lounge ) and scientist Olivia Judson take a journey of discovery through the strange world of genetic modification and engineering , and it is all happening now . They meet and see many of the strangest scientifically changed or created creatures and plants , including born featherless chickens , cloned sheep and cows , illness curing plants , regenerating mice , plants that could cure , muscle " Arnie-like " covered cows , glow-in-the-dark rabbits and pigs , grown noses ( including Giles's ) and other body parts , and many other strange things . It all comes down to using cells , DNA and technology , but the big questions are whether this is moral , whether it can help , and will it become more commercial in the future ? Worth watching !
573154	4248714	486117	5.0	Half Ton Man	This was part of the Bodyshock programmes on Channel 4 , and it was just terrible seeing what someone could do to themselves . I did not really know that food could be so addictive , and that people like Patrick Deuel can't fill their stomachs too quickly . Basically the shock of this documentary was the size and weight of Patrick , but he is not the only one . This documentary also focused on the lives of Michael Hebranko and Richard Simmons . There was also a really fat woman who lost at least 5 eighth's of her weight and was in the record books . I sometimes think that I need to exercise more to get rid of my flabby stomach , I think I'm right . Patrick ( and some other's in his condition ) is still alive , but it is a question of how long for . Good !
571575	4248714	87291	5.0	Frankenweenie	This is another quite confusing but near entertaining film written and directed by genius Tim Burton , however it does show he has a dark side to him . This is a really interesting but highly silly idea for a film , this is basically a kid version of Frankenstein . Young Victor Frankenstein ( The NeverEnding Story's Barret Oliver ) is a 10 year old boy living with his Mum Susan ( The Shining's Shelley Duvall ) and Dad Ben ( Home Alone's Daniel Stern ) . One day while playing with his dog Sparky , Victor sees his dog his by a truck . He one day in science class gets the idea of conducting electricity into his dead dog's body to bring him back . He digs it up , sews it up and put it outside to be hit by lightning . He starts off well , but when he gets outside everyone thinks he is a monster . It does have a near ending tear jerker , but it does end happily . But this is quite silly to watch , it does all the same stuff with the original Boris Karloff Frankenstein , except with a kid and his dog . But never the less , an interesting Tim Burton film . Worth watching !
571193	4248714	57197	5.0	Jason and the Argonauts	There are quite a few Greek based stories I like , i . e . Hercules and Clash of the Titans , and this is nearly one of them . Anyway , this is the story of Jason ( Todd Armstrong ) , a man on a mission from both Zeus ( Niall MacGinnis ) and his wife Hera ( Honor Blackman ) . Basically Jason has to find a brave crew and a strong ship to reach the end of the Earth to get to a magic tree . Also starring Nancy Kovack as Medea , Gary Raymond as Acastus , Laurence Naismith as Argos , Michael Gwynn as Hermes , Douglas Wilmer as Pelias , Jack Gwillim as King Aeetes , John Cairney as Hylas , Patrick Troughton as Phineas , Andrew Faulds as Phalerus and Nigel Green as Hercules ( not the strong one ) . Not all sequences were great , e . g . the rock fall with the boat , but you can't help liking the stop-motion action with Hydra , a large metal statue and evil skeletons . It was number 45 on The 100 Greatest Family Films . Worth watching !
573198	4248714	64782	5.0	Paint Your Wagon	I have to admit two of the only reasons I wanted to see this film was because of the great actor we got to know in the spaghetti westerns singing , and The Simpsons spoofed it . Basically from a cart accident , prospector Ben Rumson ( Golden Globe nominated Lee Marvin ) and Michigan farmer Pardner ( Clint Eastwood ) form a partnership in No-Name Village in the California gold country . They have a couple of adventures as the almost slow plot goes , including buying and sharing a wife , Elizabeth ( Jean Seberg ) , hijacking a stage , kidnapping six prostitutes ( so the village had more women , they originally had none ) , and turning the village into a boomtown . Filled with plenty of gambling , drinking and singing , and some creative gold mining . It was a slow film when there was no singing , but it is still a good film , and both Marvin and Eastwood are great at singing . Lee Marvin in fact was number one for the song " Wandrin ' Star " . It was nominated the Oscar for Best Music for Nelson Riddle , and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical / Comedy . It was number 57 on The 100 Greatest Musicals . Worth watching !
571931	4248714	1189092	5.0	What Britain Earns	I suppose the main reason I wanted to see this documentary was to find out if they were going to talk about jobs in the entertainment industry , even though they didn't talk about what I'd hoped it was still an interesting programme . Basically Peter Snow and his Dan Snow went around Britain , looking at many types of job and employment to show us the board of pay from lowest to highest . Jobs focused , in a bit of a random order , included ( some brief , but worth mentioning ) : leek pickers , MoneySupermarker . com , sewers ( sewage flusher ) , AA car insurance sales adviser , mortuary ( mortician ) , religions ( Rabbi , Catholic , Islam ) , plumber , underground , shopping channel , sandwich / deli shop / caf√© , stripper / pole dancer , policeman , farmer , fashion designer / wardrobe / organiser , armed services , trading / investment banks and private equity . Worth watching !
571424	4248714	280720	5.0	The Guru	I think the only reason I knew and wanted to see this film was because of the sexy leading actress from Austin Powers : The Spy Who Shagged Me , and I'm glad I tried it , from director Daisy Von Scherler Mayer ( Madeline ) . Basically Ramu Chandra Gupta ( East Is East's Jimi Mistry ) is bored with Bollywood films , but has been fascinated with Hollywood since childhood . So he travels to America , the country where dreams are made , to try and find fame . His first role is not what he expected when accidentally auditioned and won a role in a porn film , along with pron star Sharonna ( Heather Graham ) , who keeps her career secret from fianc√©e Rusty McGee ( Dash Mihok ) . Somehow Ramu gets himself into a situation where he pretends to be a sex guru , and borrowing the sexual advice of Sharonna , he slowly becomes well known as a rising star sex guru , eventually appearing on television ( for his family home to see ) . There is the obvious point of the film where it seems bad things happen to almost everyone , but it passes , Ramu eventually confesses his fraud act , and Sharonna not only is found out as a porn star , but her groom is gay . So in the end , Ramu gets his girl , I guess a good career , and the ending sees them fly off in a car , just like the end of Grease . Also starring Marisa Tomei as Lexi , The Grinch's Christine Baranski as Chantal , Michael McKean as Dwain , Rob Morrow as Josh Goldstein and Sanjeev Bhaskar as Rasphal the Cook . The comedy is light but effective , the sexuality of the film is slightly more prominent , not a bad film . Worth watching !
572489	4248714	335589	5.0	Harry Hill : First Class Scamp - Live at the London Palladium	I think I have become a fan of Harry Hill since I started watching TV Burp , a year and a half or so after it started , and so I thought I'd see what his career was like before his BAFTA winning success . I have to be honest , this wasn't what I was expecting , there was quite a lot of rambling and random music and sound effect moments , and at times , I'm afraid to say , I found it just the tiniest bit annoying . However , I still enjoyed most of the jokes , including some ones I recognised from another live stand-up show , e . g . the explanation of Joseph the musical , the problem with heroine , and the tiny holes in biscuits . If you are a fan of his , this is certainly one to try , I suppose it has it's moments . Harry Hill was number 26 on The Comedians ' Comedian , and he was number 5 on 100 Greatest Stand-Ups . Worth watching !
573208	4248714	129290	5.0	Patch Adams	Quite a good drama and comedy based on a true story , from director Tom Shadyac ( Liar Liar , The Nutty Professor ) . Golden Globe nominated Robin Williams plays Hunter Adams who attempted suicide and went to a mental hospital voluntarily . There he is called the nickname ' Patch ' and helps a roommate Rudy ( Michael Jeter ) in a hilarious way , and decides that he wants to become a doctor and connect to patients . At medical school , he meets Carin Fisher ( Monica Potter ) who at first doesn't like him too much , but she gets on better with him later . Patch also meets Truman Schiff ( Daniel London ) who assists him in his goal to help cure people by humour and connection . The only person who doesn't like this method is Dean Walcott ( Bob Gunton ) who insists that Patch should be removed from the school . There is a happy ending though , even after a tragic loss for Patch . Also starring Philip Seymour Hoffman as Mitch Roman . There are moments where the film can be a little too sentimental and drift from the main plot , but it is still a nice story . It was nominated the Oscar for Best Music for Marc Shaiman , and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy / Musical . Worth watching !
571806	4248714	120877	5.0	Vampires	I might have seen a few seconds of the beginning once , and I'm glad I watched the whole film , from director John Carpenter ( Halloween , Starman ) . Basically Jack Crow ( James Woods ) is a vampire slayer on the Vatican payroll , and accompanied by others , including Montoya ( Daniel Baldwin ) , he is obviously on the lookout for the vampires , but the only things that can kill them are stakes in the heart and sunlight , forget garlic , crosses / the crucifix and the bible , they don't help . The big threat of the film is mastermind vampire Valek ( Thomas Ian Griffith ) who needs a black cross or something to be able to walk in sunlight from then on . Also starring Sheryl Lee as Katrina , Maximilian Schell as Cardinal Alba , Tim Guinee as Father Adam Guiteau , Boone Junior as Catlin Mark and Gregory Sierra as Father Giovanni . The main reason to see this film form me , besides a good performance ( with little dialogue ) by Woods , is the gore , some good amounts . Worth watching !
571320	4248714	335345	5.0	The Passion of the Christ	Forget A Clockwork Orange , The Evil Dead , The Exorcist , Monty Python's Life of Brian and many of the other controversial films , this " labour of love " from Braveheart actor / director Mel Gibson is the most controversial film I have ever seen . In Latin and Aramaic it tells the story of the last 12 hours of Jesus Christ ( James Caviezelon ) on Earth , from the betrayal of Judas ( Luca Lionello ) in the Garden of Gethsemane after the Last Supper , till his crucifixion . It starts slow , but when Jesus is sentenced to death for " blasphemy " the controversy picks up . Jesus being scourged ( whipped ) by sticks , and by sharp-ended strings on his back , and his front , are horrifying to watch for the amount of blood and scars , and it is the son of God . Then carrying of the cross to the mountain , and after many falls he getting help from a stranger . Then it ends with the nailing of the Messiah's hands and feet , and propped to die . There is a slight happy ending though with the resurrection before the credits . Also starring Maia Morgenstern as Mary , Christo Jivkov as John , Francesco De Vito as Peter and Giacinto Ferro as Joseph of Arimathea . If you decide to watch this one day , be warned that it is very hard to deal with , and you can see why churches refused it . The fact that the film was re-released with 15 minutes of violence was cut out to make it a 15 didn't help . It was nominated the Oscars for Best Cinematography , Best Makeup and Best Music for the powerful score by John Debney . It was number 94 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers for Jesus's carrying of the cross mixed with Mary's flashbacks of him as a child . Worth watching , at least once !
572433	4248714	141005	6.0	Famous Fred	When I was a kid I used to think this was quite a funny and interesting like story about a cat becoming a star of singing . It looks like the same animation as The Snowman , but it doesn't make you cry as much . Basically , a cat named Fred who belonged to Nick and Sophie . They soon find out Ginger and many others cats are holding a tribute and funeral to their star . Kenneth the hamster tells the story of why Fred was so famous . He first started as a present for Mum , then he grew to become the cats favourite singing sensation . He soon became known as Famous Fred . It's such a shame he died , or did he , he had one of nine lives left ! Lenny Henry as Fred is just perfect . It was nominated the Oscar and BAFTA , both for Best Short Film , Animated . Good !
571241	4248714	70608	6.0	Robin Hood	Before I heard of the Kevin Costner and Errol Flynn versions of the classic legend story of the man who stole from the rich and gave to the poor , there was this cartoon version by Walt Disney Pictures , with the interesting idea of animals playing the characters . I obviously liked it when I was a kid , but I saw it not too long ago , and it is just a bit corny and more aimed at kids . Anyway , it brings back singer Phil Harris from The Aristocats and The Jungle Book , as Little John . It also introduces Brian Bedford as Robin Hood . There are some good moments of cartoon like comedy , but again , more for kids . Also starring Peter Ustinov as Prince John and tom thumb's Terry-Thomas as Sir Hiss . It was nominated the Oscar for Best Song for " Love " . Good !
572422	4248714	285823	6.0	Once Upon a Time in Mexico	If you remember Desperado , then you may enjoy this sequel made eight years later , from it's director Robert Rodriguez ( From Dusk Till Dawn , Sin City ) , apparently remaking his low budget debut El Mariachi . El Mariachi ( Antonio Banderas ) lost his wife Carolina ( Salma Hayek ) and daughter when they were killed ( gun shot ) by drug lords , and he has returned not only to stop the new ones , but get revenge on the one who arranged the shooting . Basically , new drug lord Barillo ( Willem Dafoe ) is pretending to overthrow the Mexican president , and meanwhile , using the Mariachi to help him , corrupt CIA agent Sands ( Johnny Depp ) is trying to discover whatever he can about their drug lords ' plans . Marquez ( Gerardo Vigil ) , the man who killed his family , is with the lords as well . Cucuy ( Danny Trujo ) , the muscle for Sands is keeping tabs on the Mariachi . He however has the help of retired-FBI agent Jorge Ramirez ( Rub√©n Blades ) and Lorenzo ( singer Enrique Iglesias , mole ! ) to help him defeat the villains . Also starring Mickey Rourke as Billy , Eva Mendes as Ajedrez , Marco Leonardi as Fideo and Cheech Marin as Belini . It may not have a great story as such , but there is enough gun shooting , chase and action sequences to please people . Good !
571291	4248714	147800	6.0	10 Things I Hate About You	This is quite a good teen comedy with just a hint of drama , but it isn't exactly one of the best teen films . The only thing I can remember watching it ( we watched it in two English lessons for some kind of research ) is Heath Ledger as Patrick ' Pat ' Verona , the main and most attractive guy to the girls . Well , and there's also the appearance of Dean Richmond from The Nutty Professor , Larry Miller as Dr . Walter Stratford . Apart from that , I can't remember any of the so-called jokes that made anybody in my class laugh . Hardly any of the film had a lot of laughter for me , but I'd need to see it again to make sure . Quite good , as far as I can remember .
571331	4248714	70379	6.0	Mean Streets	This is a bit of a landmark film as it was it was the first time director Martin Scorsese casted Robert De Niro , a collaboration that has continued in numerous films . It was also the second time he casted Harvey Keitel . Anyway , basically , set in the " mean streets " of New York City , the story follows small-time wise-guy community member Charlie ( Keitel ) , with friends Tony ( David Proval ) and Michael ( Richard Romanus ) , and most prominently , unreliable , near psychotic and to-be shunned friend Johnny Boy ( De Niro ) . He also has a secret girlfriend , Teresa ( Amy Robinson ) , Johnny Boy's cousin , who must also be shunned because of epilepsy . Charlie's uncle Giovanni ( Cesare Danova ) offers him a restaurant , and he is forced to choose between gaining power , love for Teresa , or protecting Johnny Boy . Also starring Victor Argo as Mario , Robert Carradine as Assassin , Jeannie Bell as Diane and David Carradine as Drunk , with narration by Scorsese himself . I will admit I did not pay full attention to this film , because it was a bit too chatty for my liking , but when it wasn't , it had great moments of violence , so it is worth watching . Good !
572821	4248714	933158	6.0	The Secret Policeman's Ball : The Ball in the Hall	This was a great Amnesty International charity show on Channel 4 . It first started back in 1976 with acts from the likes of Rowan Atkinson , the Monty Python team and Victoria Wood , and since then , this one came along . I cannot remember laughing all that much at everything , but I certainly remember many of the faces . These include The Big Impression's Ronni Ancona , Russell Brand , Chevy Chase , Dead Ringers ' Jon Culshaw , Julia Davis , Jimmy Fallon , The Mighty Boosh ( including Julian Barratt and Noel Fielding ) , Richard E . Grant , Stephen Mangan , Austin Powers ' Seth Green , Jeremy Irons , Eddie Izzard , Andrew Maxwell , Al Murray ( The Pub Landlord ) , Graham Norton , EastEnders ' Shaun Williamson , and my favourite act , Dave Armand ( Johan Lippowitz ) doing sign language with Natalie Imbruglia singing her song " Torn " . Good !
571714	4248714	43274	6.0	Alice in Wonderland	When I was a kid , this used to be quite a good animated film from Walt Disney Pictures , a bit more aimed at girls and readers of the famous book by Louis Carol , but good . Alice is listening to her boring older sister reading History research and then she is distracted by a white rabbit in clothes with a watch . She follows this rabbit into a rabbit hole which leads to Topsy-turvy world of Wonderland . In this world there are talking locked doors , talking Dodos , twin fat blokes that squeak called Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum , a Mad Hatter ( voiced by Mary Poppins Uncle Albert , Ed Wynn ) and a March Hare , a nasty Queen with a deck of cards as guards and many other bizarre things . Alice later gives up wondering about the rabbit and tries to find her way home . Will she get out , or will the Queen have head chopped off for making her lose her temper ? It was number 71 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons . Good !
572540	4248714	64757	6.0	On Her Majesty's Secret Service	Golden Globe nominated Australian actor George Lazenby played Commander James Bond 007 in his one and only film , and the result afterwards ( at cinemas ) was that they wanted Sir Sean Connery back , and they got it in a really silly Diamonds Are Forever , and again 12 years later in Never Say Never Again . Anyway , he is quite cool , calm and posh like , but he does not have the same sense of humour or good acting style as Connery , or any of the other Bonds . In this , he basically has to stop SPECTRE boss Ernst Stavro Blofeld ( who he met in You Only Live Twice , here played by Telly Savalas ) from world domination , somehow . During the process he falls in love with Contessa Teresa ' Tracy ' Di Vicenzo ( Diana Rigg ) . He tells her that no other girl has touched him like her , and they marry at the end . Also starring Gabriele Ferzetti as Marc Ange Draco , Ilse Steppat as Irma Bunt , Angela Scoular as Ruby Bartlett , Lois Maxwell as Miss Moneypenny , George Baker as Sir Hilary Bray , Bernard Lee as M , Desmond Llewelyn as Q and a quick appearance by Joanna Lumley . James Bond was number 3 on 100 Years , 100 Heroes & Villains , he was number 21 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols , and he was number 21 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons , and the film was number 12 on James Bond's Greatest Hits for both the title theme music and Louis Armstrong's " We Have All the Time in the World " , and it was number 41 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers for the ending because their marriage lasts only five minutes . Good !
572563	4248714	87233	6.0	Falling in Love	This is a really sentimental film about how a first brief meeting , and then another few can start a bigger relationship . Starring Robert De Niro as Frank Raftis , he bumps into Meryl Streep as Molly Gilmore in a book store , and they get their wrapped books mixed up . A few months they meet each other again at the train station , and they become friends . They see each other a few more times after that , and then eventually they realise it is love , but they are both married ! It is amazing how only a few meetings turns into obsession , it is obviously when bad things happen to them both , and their marriages , that you wonder if they should be together . Also starring Harvey Keitel as Ed Lasky and Edward Scissorhands ' Dianne Wiest as Isabelle . Good !
571525	4248714	490134	6.0	Ghostboat	I'm not sure if this story was true because the war on at the time ended not long after , and there was mention of bodies never recovered in the wreck of the boat , but personally , who cares . This is a very interesting and near creepy story of one man's survival on a boat , and then somehow , the same events happen again on what seems to be the same boat . Sir David Jason as Jack Hardy is the man who survived a terrible storm on a large boat / submarine . Unfortunately , the events that previously happened to him happen again , and the members of the new boat he is on seem to " sink " into the spell of past history . Jack is now trying everyone he can to stop the events that happened to him and the boat 40 years ago . Good !
571090	4248714	906711	6.0	A Girl's Guide to 21st Century Sex	Channel 5 when it first started always seemed to be the one with the most pornography ( probably trying to be more naughty than Channel 4 ) , and I always looked forward to the next one , then I saw this . Presented by Dr . Catherine Hood , and featuring interviews with experts and people who have experienced the programme subjects , this show basically shows you the things you should know , the things you didn't know , the things you can do , the things you should be aware of , and basically how to improve your sex life . It has covered pretty much everything from positions , homosexual / lesbian relationship , pregnancy , ejaculation , diseases and infections , and much more . The nudity is interesting , apart from gross bits involving cameras in the vagina , e . g . seeing a cock ejaculate , but it is still an interesting documentary series . Good !
572702	4248714	1155054	6.0	Happy Birthday BAFT	I have always liked the BAFTA awards for seeing great recent film and television for being nominated for , and winning worthy awards , and to celebrate the 60th birthday of the ceremonies , there came this special tribute evening . Hosted by Michael Parkinson ( who was retiring from his chat show career ) and Joanna Lumley , this programme saw some little sketches , some dancing , some singing , and basically celebrated all the great television and film that BAFTA has praised . Shiow highlights include : Miss Piggy meeting Sharon Osbourne ( both divas ) and fighting the limelight , the cast of Billy Elliot dancing ( and singing a bit ) , Celine Dion singing " My Heart Will Go On " , the cast of Upstairs Downstairs reunited , The Kumars ( Sanjeev Bhaskar , Meera Syal , Vincent Ebrahim , Indira Joshi ) meeting Sir Ben Kingsley , Stanley Baxter , a new stand-up routine from Victoria Wood , Andrea Bocelli singing West Side Story's " Maria " , and Alexander Armstrong and Ben Miller recreating the great Morecambe and Wise Breakfast sketch . Also appearing are Melvyn Bragg , Robert Carlyle , Pauline Collins ( aka Shirley Valentine ) , and of course , Lord Sir Richard Attenborough . With some good clips from great films and television , it was a good programme . Good !
571715	4248714	284837	6.0	Ali G Indahouse	If you are a fan of smooth , hip talking or just a bit of hip hop , then you'll like this film , as for everyone else , you can enjoy Sacha Baron Cohen as the great Ali G . Borat ( Cohen ) also appears , but his own film is much better . Basically , Ali G lives in the West Side of Staines and is protesting about his Leisure Centre closing down . So he decides to join the Prime Minister ( Sir Michael Gambon ) and his nasty assistant David Carlton ( Charles Dance ) in parliament , hence the title , Indahouse . Also starring Kellie Bright as " me " Julie , Martin Freeman as Ricky C , the fit Rhona Mitra as Kate Hedges , Tony Way as Dave , EastEnders ' Nabil Elouhabi as Jezzy F and Ray Panthaki as Hassan B , Naomi Campbell , newsreader Jon Snow , EastEnders ' Rudolph Walker as President Mwepu , and Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan . Ali G was number 8 on The 100 Greatest TV Characters , he was number 6 on The 100 Greatest Funny Moments , along with Borat at number 24 ( and Bruno at number 77 ) , and he was number 6 on The World's Greatest Comedy Characters , with Borat at number 17 , and Sacha Baron Cohen ( or as the character ) was number 12 on Britain's Favourite Comedian . Good !
572890	4248714	372784	7.0	Batman Begins	The first of the Batman films directed by Tim Burton is just the best one . Why did Memento and Insomnia director Chrsitopher Nolan have to start the whole story from scratch ? He shows a new version of Wayne's parents murder , and how he became the Caped Crusader . Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne and Batman is very good for being mysterious and rough in places . He is also very good at being suave and posh . The villains in this one are Liam Neeson as Ducard , he works for Ra's Al Ghul , unless he is him . There is also Cillian Murphy as the terrifying Scarecrow , Dr . Jonathan Crane . Also starring Michael Caine as Alfred , Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes , Gary Oldman as Jim Gordon and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox . It was nominated the Oscar for Best Cinematography , and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Special Visual Effects , Best Production Design and Best Sound . Batman was number 84 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons . Very good !
572491	4248714	893357	7.0	The National Television 2006	It is the same every year , a celebration of television over the last year , and awarding those who deserve . Sir Trevor McDonald hosted this great evening , I cannot remember all the awards , apart from Best Actor to David Tennant ( in Doctor Who ) , Best Actress to Billie Piper ( for Doctor Who ) , Best Newcomer Actor to Charlie Clements ( for EastEnders ) , Best Entertainment Programme to The X Factor , Best Reality Show to Big Brother , Best TV Contendor to Nikki Grahame ( from Big Brother ) , Best Factual Programme to Top Gear , Best Soap to EastEnders and Best Long Running Career ( or something ) to Sir David Walliams . Presenters , winners and guests included : Peter Andre and Katie Price ( Jordan ) , Julie Andrews , Michael Barrymore , Fern Britton , Jeremy Clarkson and James May , Charlie Clements , Antony Cotton , Simon Cowell , Anthony Head , Terri Irwin ( Steve Irwin's wife ) , Boris Johnson , Vernon Kay , Davina McCall and Dermot O'Leary , Jack and Kelly Osbourne , John Savident , Phillip Schofield , David Schwimmer , Chico Slimani , Kate Thornton , David Walliams , Louis Walsh and Barbara Windsor . Very good !
571849	4248714	65322	7.0	Mr . Benn	When I was younger I didn't watch this all the time , but when I did it was quite good . Although it was basically the same setup every week , the new adventures was what I watched it for . Basically the show ( narrated and voiced by Ray Brooks , who went to EastEnders in 2006 ) is about a man called Mr Benn . Mr Benn always goes to his local costume shop . He then sees the man that appears and disappears . Mr Benn chooses a costume to try on in the fitting rooms , and the he enters a magic door that takes him on an adventure involving the costumes purpose . He's been a clown , a astronaut , a submarine person , an Arabian and many other adventures . It was number 6 on The 100 Greatest Kids ' TV Shows . Very good for the kids !
571392	4248714	439	7.0	The Great Train Robbery	This is one of the most significant films in cinema history , it is the second ( after A Trip to the Moon - 1902 ) to feature in the book " 1001 Movies You Must Before You Die " . Basically a clerk of a train station is assaulted and left tied up by four bandits , and they proceed to carry out the great train robbery robbery of the title . They line up all passengers of the train , after unhooking the passenger cars from the engine , and take all wallets and money from them . Quickly they get in the engine , go forward a bit , and then run out to ride away on some horses , and then they enter a saloon , forcing people at gunpoint to dance , before a final shoot-out , where the robbers are killed . The iconic image of this film is the final shot where a moustached bandit faces the audiences and shoots , disappearing in the cloud of smoke . It may a bit shaky and black and white , but it is an important film , as it was the first ever western , I think it was the first to feature guns , and of course , it was the first to feature both heroes and villains , as 100 Years , 100 Heroes & Villains explained . Very good !
571753	4248714	126170	7.0	Recess	This used by one of the best reasons to get up early on a Saturday morning . This cartoon was just one of the best weekend treats when I was younger . Basically it is showing all the adventures that all the kids of an American school have in Recess . The main kids are T . J . ( the boss ) , Vince ( the cool one ) , Mikey ( the greedy fat simple one ) , Gretchen ( the smart nerdy one ) , Gus ( the wimp ) and Spinelli ( the tough girl ) . There were some other good characters during Recess that the main kids dealt with . There was the mean playground minder Miss Finster with her young sneaky spy-like assistant , Randall . There was the constant watcher ( of T . J . especially ) and manager of the school Principal Prickley . There was also the ruler of the playground , the teenager King Bob ( anything he said had to be done ) . This is very good from time to time , the kids will love it if they like Disney and Saturday morning cartoons . Very good !
573108	4248714	286261	7.0	All or Nothing	I had seen the controversial and hard-hitting Vera Drake from director Mike Leigh , and the critics liked this film , so I decided to give it a go . There was no real plot to the story for a while , just a gentle , philosophical taxi driver named Phil ( Timothy Spall ) who has a dry love relationship with his partner ( who works in a supermarket ) Penny ( Lesley Manville ) , their daughter Rachel ( Alison Garland ) is an elderly people's home cleaner , and their son son Rory ( James Corden ) is unemployed and aggressive . It is when Rory suffers a near-fatal heart attack that the film really gets it's biggest interest ( although there are moments of good chat before ) , and all characters are brought together to rediscover themselves . Also starring Ruth Sheen as Maureen , Marion Bailey as Carol , Paul Jesson as Ron , Sam Kelly as Sid , Kathryn Hunter as C√©cile , Sally Hawkins as Samantha and Helen Coker as Donna . The actors are great , the story is human and believable , and this is just one of those films that you can't stop watching . Very good !
571967	4248714	64840	7.0	The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie	I have to admit I wasn't paying the biggest amount of attention to the story itself , but I saw enough to agree with most opinions that this is quite a good film . Basically Jean Brodie ( Oscar and BAFTA winning , and Golden Globe nominated Dame Maggie Smith ) is a young teacher at an Edinburgh school for girls , and ignoring the more mundane subjects , she instead teaches the girls about love , politics and art . Miss Brodie's two affairs with male teachers starts her fighting to keep her job , and also , one of her students thinks she's lost her " prime " , and learns life and love for herself . To be honest , that's all I could grasp in the story . Also starring Robert Stephens as Teddy Lloyd , BAFTA nominated Pamela Franklin as Sandy , Gordon Jackson as Gordon Lowther , BAFTA winning Celia Johnson as Miss Mackay , Diane Grayson as Jenny , Jane Carr as Mary McGregor , Shirley Steedman as Monica , Lavinia Lang as Emily Carstairs and Antoinette Biggerstaff as Helen McPhee . To be honest , I think the only good reason to see the film is for the Oscar winning performance by Smith , I couldn't concentrate on much else . It was nominated the Oscar for Best Song for " Jean " ( it won the Golden Globe ) , and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama . Dame Maggie Smith was number 4 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses , she was number 4 on Britain's Finest Actresses , and she was number 20 on The World's Greatest Actor . Very good !
571413	4248714	338751	7.0	The Aviator	This biographical drama from Oscar , BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Martin Scorsese ( Taxi Driver , The Departed ) is not as good as the much more accomplished biopic Raging Bull ( about Jake La Motta ) , but it is certainly worth a go . It shows the life of Hollywood mogul and aviator ( plane pilot and designer ) Howard Hughes ( Golden Globe winning , and Oscar and BAFTA nominated Leonardo DiCaprio ) . It shows his making of his only two ( directed ) films Hell's Angels ' and The Outlaw ( although he's best known for helping Howard Hawks make the original 1932 Scarface ) , his affairs with such stars as Ava Gardner ( miscast Kate Beckinsale ) , Jean Harlow ( singer Gwen Stefani ) , and more prominently , the great Katharine Hepburn ( Oscar and BAFTA winning , and Golden Globe nominated Cate Blanchett ) , and his millions spent , lost and succeeded on plane design and manufacture . But the scenes I found most intriguing and gripping were his attempts , successes and one big failure in plane test flights ( notably the one that almost crippled him ) , and his slow decent into both bankruptcy and madness , his repeating of phrases is most frequent . Also starring John C . Reilly as Noah Dietrich , Alec Baldwin as Juan Trippe , Oscar and BAFTA nominated Alan Alda as Senator Ralph Owen Brewster , Sir Ian Holm as Professor Fitz , Danny Huston as Jack Frye , Jude Law as Errol Flynn , Edward Herrmann as Joseph Breen , Willem Dafoe as Roland Sweet , Kelli Garner as Faith Domergue , Adam Scott as Johnny Meyer , Frances Conroy as Mrs . Hepburn , Independence Day's Brent Spiner as Robert Gross , Matt Ross as Glenn Odekirk , Kenneth Welsh as Dr . Thomas Norval Hepburn and Kevin O'Rourke as Spencer Tracy . Most of the actors in this film do look and sound ( a little mostly ) like who they are meant to be , Blanchett and DiCaprio obviously being best , there are some memorable moments , e . g . the plane crash , and Scorsese makes quite an intense ( in parts ) film . It won the Oscars for Best Art Direction , Best Cinematography , Best Costume Design and Best Editing , and it was nominated for Best Sound Mixing , Best Writing , Original Screenplay and Best Motion Picture of the Year , it won the BAFTAs for Best Film , Best Make Up / Hair and Best Production Design , and it was nominated the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music for Howard Shore , Best Special Visual Effects , Best Cinematography , Best Costume Design , Best Editing , Best Original Screenplay , Best Sound and the David Lean Award for Direction , and it won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Original Score , and it was nominated for Best Screenplay . Very good !
573056	4248714	305002	7.0	The Big Bang	This was and still is a pretty good show for both some theory , some small questions answered and some science stuff to listen to or create yourself . Violet Berlin has been in it ever since it started , it also used to have How 2's Gareth Jones as one of the best male hosts . Violet even looked pregnant in one of the series . The Big Bang is obviously the earth beginning , so it's obvious they should do science stuff . They show you how to put a cup of water over your head without it dropping , how to make your own home-made crisps , how to race with empty bottles , how to use a professional telescope and many other interesting things . Good !
573005	4248714	51207	7.0	The Wrong Man	Sir Alfred Hitchcock , Master of Suspense , was popular for taking terrible incidents in real life and turning them into what make his masterpieces ( most popular being Psycho ) , but this film is only focusing on the true story itself . Basically Christopher Emmanuel ' Manny ' Balestrero ( Henry Fonda ) is an ordinary New York musician who is wrongfully identified and arrested for the crime of hold-up robbery , as he was innocently getting money for his wife Rose ( Psycho's Vera Miles ) to have dental treatment . Manny constantly pleads his innocence , but in doing so looks even more guilty , especially host to the police and witnesses who point to him . Unfortunately , Rose breaks down into a depression and is institutionalised , while his trial isn't going well , even granted mistrial , but thankfully , awaiting re-trial , the real criminal is caught ( and there is a likeness by the way ) , and he is set free , while his wife still remains in her quiet state , don't worry , the ending text said she recovered , and they moved to Florida . Also starring Lawrence of Arabia's Anthony Quayle as Frank D . O'Connor , Harold J . Stone as Det . Lt . Bowers , Esther Minciotti as Mama Balestrero , Charles Cooper as Det . Matthews , Nehemiah Persoff as Eugene ' Gene ' Conforti , Laurinda Barrett as Constance Willis , Norma Connolly as Betty Todd , Doreen Lang as Ann James , Frances Reid as Mrs . O'Connor , Lola D'Annunzio as Manny's Sister Olga Conforti , Robert Essen as Gregory Balestrero and Kippy Campbell as Robert Balestrero . I can see why this film is a bit forgotten by Hitch fans , but with fine performances from Fonda and Miles , and a great real story from a fine director , this does deserves more popularity . Sir Alfred Hitchcock was number 75 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons . Very good !
572303	4248714	67402	7.0	Mary , Queen of Scots	I noticed the year this film was made , 1971 , and besides the two great lead actresses , I think I was more interested in seeing a young future James Bond , well , and the critics give it four out of five stars . Basically this film is a battle of ruler-ship of both England and Scotland , and the fight is between Mary Stuart , Queen of Scots ( Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Vanessa Redgrave ) and Queen Elizabeth I ( Golden Globe nominated Glenda Jackson ) . Both Queens have plans to remove each other from their thrones , or better , have each other eliminated . In the end , Mary is the loser after being sentenced to death , and Elizabeth ruled for years after . Even though I do not understand everything going on , there is a lot of discussion with many male characters involved in whatever way to one of the two Queens , including James Stuart ( Scanners ' Patrick McGoohan ) , Lord Henry Darnley ( young - and blonde ? - Timothy Dalton ) , Lord Bothwell ( Nigel Davenport , Jack's father ) , William Cecil ( Trevor Howard ) and David Rizzio ( Sir Ian Holm ) . Apparently not all the story is accurate in relation to what really happened , but who cares ? Also starring Daniel Massey as Robert Dudley - Earl of Leicester , Tom Fleming as Father Ballard , Jeremy Bulloch as Andrew , Beth Harris as Mary Seton , Frances White as Mary Fleming and Maria Aitken as Lady Bothwell . All actors are suited to their roles very well , especially Redgrave and Jackson , and as for young Dalton , well , an unusually double-edged character , but a good one , and the film is worth seeing . It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration , Best Costume Design , Best Music for John Barry and Best Sound , and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama , Best Original Score and Best Screenplay . Very good !
571465	4248714	64418	7.0	Hello , Dolly !	My Mum said she did not like the main actress of this film , I can say that she is a little annoying in this role , but she is probably eccentric . Basically Dolly Levi ( BAFTA nominated Barbra Streisand in her second film role , after coming from stage ) is a matchmaker , and has her own eyes set on single millionaire Horace Vandergelder ( BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Walter Matthau ) . She convinces him to go to New York , and secretly also does the same for his two excitable clerks Cornelius Hackl ( Some Mothers Do ' Ave ' Em's Michael Crawford ) and Barnaby Tucker ( Danny Lockin ) , his niece Irene Molloy ( twice Golden Globe nominated Marianne McAndrew ) and her beau Minnie Fay ( E . J . Peaker ) . The romance between the clerks and the shop women is definitely strong , but Dolly has to go quite far to interest Vandergelder . With a fantastic cameo by Louis Armstrong . . . Louis , who had a number one with the song Hello , Dolly ! in America . I never thought I'd see Matthau in a musical , but he great , the only other little flaw is a not-fantastic American accent by Crawford , but it is not a big deal . The highlights for me are in the restaurant with dancing waiters , clerks , Armstrong and some good laughs . A great film with some great songs and dance . It won the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration , Best Music and Best Sound , and it was nominated for Best Cinematography , Best Costume Design , Best Film Editing and Best Picture , it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Art Direction and Best Cinematography , and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Director for Gene Kelly and Best Motion Picture - Musical / Comedy . It was number 50 on The 100 Greatest Musicals . Very good !
573289	4248714	90863	7.0	The Color of Money	If you have seen The Hustler , then you would know that this is the sequel from director Martin Scorsese ( GoodFellas , The Departed ) , and apparently the flashier film . Paul Newman reprises his role as pool shark and " hustler " ' Fast Eddie Felson , and won an Oscar ( and was nominated the Golden Globe ) . Basically Eddie has been forced into retirement , and he enters a relationship with promising young pool player Vincent Lauria ( Tom Cruise ) , along with his girlfriend Carmen ( Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio ) . In this relationship Eddy finds himself , self-respect and redemption , and as they travel he realises how much he lost , but he can see history beginning to repeat itself . Vincent has a habit of showing off his talent , and by doing so is losing players / opponents and money . In an effort to avert tragedy , Eddy ends the relationship , and returns to his love of pool . Finally , in a big Atlantic City tournament , Vincent returns the favour by teaching the final lesson to Eddy allowing him to finish his quest for rediscovery . Also starring Helen Shaver as Janelle , John Turturro as Julian , Bill Cobbs as Orvis , Robert Agins as Earl at Chalkie's , Keith McCready as Grady Seasons , Carol Messing as Casino Bar Band Singer / Julian's Flirt , Steve Mizerak as Duke , Eddie's First Opponent , Alvin Anastasia as Kennedy , Joe Guastaferro as Chuck the Bartender , then little known Forest Whitaker as Amos and Iggy Pop Skinny Player on Road . The pool games are interesting to watch , both Newman and Cruise have their moments in their roles , and good direction from Scorcese , a good film . It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Writing , Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium . Tom Cruise was number 32 , and Paul Newman number 16 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars , Cruise was also number 25 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols , and he was number 81 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons . Very good !
571019	4248714	101862	7.0	Father of the Bride	As far as I can work out , it is after this film that the career of Steve Martin has had very few laughs , which is a shame , he just needs to find the right film . Anyway , this is the remake of the 1950 film , and it sees middle aged father George Banks ( Martin ) with wife Nina ( Diane Keaton ) having to prepare the wedding for their 21-year-old daughter Annie Banks ( Kimberly Williams-Paisley ) . They had never met her fianc√©e Bryan MacKenzie ( George Newbern ) , living an upper class with his parents in Bel-Air , but George tries to keep his feelings about wedding preparations and this new man in his daughter's life intact . But it is mainly the thought of never seeing his daughter again that gets to George the most , and it is only after a near cancellation ( over a blender ) that he understands he has to let go and reunites the happy couple . So the wedding day comes , George walks Annie up the aisle , and the rest of the day he can't even say his final goodbye before they leave for honeymoon , but at least she called him . Also starring Home Alone's Kieran Culkin ( Macaulay's brother ) as Matty Banks , Martin Short as Franck Eggelhoffer , B . D . Wong as Howard Weinstein , Peter Michael Goetz as John MacKenzie , Kate McGregor-Stewart as Joanna MacKenzie , Carmen Hayward as Grace and April Ortiz as Olivia . Martin does do well , Keaton offers a good support , and Short adds giggles as the foreign wedding organiser , and while there are one or two good gags , it is the mushy bits ( which I'm not always up for ) that actually do most good . Very good !
572423	4248714	66580	7.0	Woodstock : The Director's Cut	I knew of this documentary because it is in the book of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die , and I had heard of the concert itself , and I can see why it won an Oscar . To be honest , I was really " watching " it , mainly just listening to it while working , because of the good music shows , but also because I did not realise the original cut was only 3 hours and four minutes , this director's cut version I saw was an extra 48 minutes of footage . This film from director Michael Wadleigh , with the assistance of Thelma Shoonmaker ( editor of such films as Goodfellas , Gangs of New York and The Departed , see the connection ) and Martin Scorcese , this basically had footage from all sides ( on and off stage ) at the fields of upstate New York in 1969 of the biggest gathering ( at the time , Live Aid probably beat it ) in history for a big music festival . With music from The Who , Sha-Na-Na , Joe Cocker , Country Joe and the Fish , Crosby , Stills and Nash , Ten Years After , Santana , Sly & the Family Stone and Jimi Hendrix . It won the Oscar for Best Documentary , Features , and it was nominated for Best Film Editing and Best Sound . It was number 36 on The 50 Greatest Documentaries . Very good !
572847	4248714	448124	7.0	Snow Cake	From director Marc Evans ( My Little Eye ) , this mix of both comedic and tragic moments is a very good look at Autism , almost as effect as Rain Man . Basically Alex Hughes ( Alan Rickman ) is a recently released ( for murder ) man travelling to Winnipeg to see an old friend , and along the way he gives the annoying , but vivacious Vivienne Freeman ( Emily Hampshire ) . He may not have wanted to at first , and just when he warms to her eccentric nature , the vehicle is in a serious automobile accident , killing Vivienne . After talking to the police , he sees the address of Vivienne's mother , and decides to speak to her . After a difficult meeting with the mother Linda ( Sigourney Weaver ) , he afterwards talks to neighbour Maggie ( Carrie-Anne Moss ) , who explains to him that she has autism . Linda wants him to stay till after the funeral , the day the garbage is collected , and he agrees . In the days leading up to it , Alex makes a partner with Maggie and a few other friends , and learning more about Linda's uniqueness he also finds himself letting out past demons , such as his son's death and the man he killed . The moments that really get to you are the Scrabble game with made up words and an example of their use , and of course , the end , when Alex leaves Linda a cake made of snow ( because she likes to eat it , and has no temperature sense ) , and it is Maggie that takes the garbage out for her . Also starring James Allodi as Clyde , Janet Van De Graaf as Meryl , Julie Stewart as Florence , Selina Cadell as Diane Wooton , Callum Keith Rennie as John Neil and David Fox as Dirk Freeman . I can have some understanding of the character of Linda ( not in exactly the same way ) , because I myself have a form of Autism called Asperger's Syndrome . Weaver is very compelling , Rickman makes the most of his self-grieving character , and the support from Moss and the brief Hampshire are good too , a good tragicomedy . Very good !
572718	4248714	82031	7.0	Arthur	If you like interesting one joke comedies , then you might be interested in this film . Oscar nominated and Golden Globe winning Dudley Moore plays millionaire playboy Arthur Bach , a man who lives on quite a lot of alcohol and spends all his money on it , plus high living . One day he is told that he must get married if he wants to keep his share of the family fortune . Obviously , because he drinks a lot he doesn't try that hard . Although , he does meet his perfect woman , Linda Marolla ( Golden Globe winning Liza Minnelli ) , a poor woman living with her father . Everyone thinks that she is the wrong woman because Arthur is already engaged . It does have a happy ending , although it does take a little while to get to it . It won the Oscars for Best Song , and Best Supporting Actor for Sir John Gielgud as Hobson , Arthur's Valet , and it was nominated for Best Writing , Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen , it was nominated the BAFTA for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music for Burt Bacharach , Best Supporting Actor for John Gielgud , and it won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Comedy / Musical , Best Actor for Dudley Moore , Best Supporting Actor in a for John Gielgud and Best Original Song for " Arthur's Theme ( Best That You Can Do ) " . It was number 53 on 100 Years , 100 Laughs . Good !
572057	4248714	109040	8.0	Ace Ventura : Pet Detective	This was Jim Carrey's first official role and launched his brilliant career . He stars as Ace Ventura : Pet Detective . " He's the best there is . Actually , he's the only one there is . " The mascot of the Miami Dolphins " Snowflake the Dolphin " has been kidnapped . It is Ace's job to find this dolphin . He has help from Courney Cox ( Arquette ) and Sean Young who has a funny but sick story towards the end . There is also an appearance by legendary Miami Dolphin player Dan Marino ( as himself ) . A hilarious film with wonderful slapstick and cuddly animals thrown in . The best part for me is seeing Ace being thrown about by a shark ! Ace Ventura : When Nature Calls followed . Very good !
573230	4248714	112851	8.0	Desperado	From director Robert Rodriguez ( From Dusk Till Dawn , Sin City ) , it almost seems like a modern western , in American Italy . It starts with Buscemi ( Steve Buscemi ) telling a story about a guitar player killer that he saw , and most people have heard this before as a legend / myth . But he is real , and soon enough trouble brews as El Mariachi ( Antonio Banderas ) searches for his " girl's " killer , Bucho ( Joaquim De Almeida ) . This is pretty much the main plot , the great moments of the film come from Bandares and his gun filled guitar case . I have not seen Bandares this good since The Mask of Zorro . Also starring Salma Hayek ( who shows her breasts , very briefly ) as Carolina , Cheech Marin as Short Bartender , Carlos G√≥mez as Right Hand and with no involvement besides acting , Quentin Tarantino as Pick-Up Guy . Banderas and Hayek returned in the 2003 sequel , Once Upon a Time in Mexico . Very good !
570994	4248714	118548	8.0	Absolute Power	A very good thriller directed by and starring Clint Eastwood . Luther Whitney ( Eastwood ) has witnessed a murder taking place as he was committing a robbery . He was stealing money and jewels when he saw them come in and he hid in a secret room . He saw President Richmond ( Gene Hackman ) rape and kill an innocent girl . Luther is now trying to hide from both the police and the President ( he knows that he saw him ) . At the same time , Luther is also trying to get his relationship with his daughter Kate ( Laura Linney ) back to normal . But she knows what he has done in the past , she is not sure she can trust him . Also starring Ed Harris as Seth Frank . A very good thriller from a very good director , and actor . Very good !
572746	4248714	65126	8.0	True Grit	I had heard and remembered the character name somewhere , and I always wondered if the lead male star had ever had an Oscar winning role , so I was really looking forward to seeing both . Basically in the wild west of California , the father of Mattie Ross ( BAFTA nominated Kim Darby ) is killed by Tom Chaney ( Jeff Corey ) , she is determined to avenge the death , find Chaney and bring him to justice ( have him hanged ) . She recruits tough , old , drunken , one-eyed ( lost in war ) U . S . Marshall Reuben J . ' Rooster ' Cogburn ( Oscar and Golden Globe winning John Wayne ) , because he has a good reputation , and people say he has " grit " , and they are accompanied by Texas Ranger La Boeuf ( Golden Globe nominated Glen Campbell ) . Along the way they have some chats with crooks who may know where to find him , including Moon ( young Dennis Hopper ) , and they have their " get-to-know-eachother " chats , before they eventually find Chaney , and the rest of his gang lead by Ned Pepper ( Robert Duvall ) . The concluding scenes with the many shooting is quite gripping , and there are some good scenes of Cogburn showing his true worth . Also starring Jeremy Slate as Emmett Quincy , Alfred Ryder as Mr . Goudy ( Defense attorney ) , Strother Martin as Colonel G . Stonehill , Ron Soble as Capt . Boots Finch , John Fiedler as Lawyer Daggett , James Westerfield as Judge Parker and John Doucette as Sheriff . This is definitely a must-see western and Wayne film . It was nominated the Oscar and Golden Globe for Best Song for " True Grit " . John Wayne was number 56 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars , and he was number 13 on 100 Years , 100 Stars - Men , and Rooster Cogburn was number 36 on 100 Years , 100 Heroes & Villains . Very good !
573131	4248714	47677	8.0	The Wild One	I had always wanted to see the film that The Godfather star is representing in London's Madame Tussauds . Based on a real 1947 incident where a cycle gang terrorised the small town of Hollister , California on the 4th of July , and the film was banned for a while . Basically 40 motorcyclists , The Black Rebels Motorcycle Club , go to the town of Wrightsville after being thrown out of viewing a legitimate motorcycle race . They stole the second place trophy , and gave it to their leader , Johnny ( Marlon Brando ) . Some people do complain about their hanging around the Bleekers bar , but Sheriff Singer ( Jay C . Flippen ) cannot seem to address their disturbance . Meanwhile , Johnny falls for the Sheriff's daughter , Kathie ( Mary Murphy ) , and rival gang The Beetles show up for a while , led by Chino ( Paint Your Wagon's Lee Marvin ) . Also starring Robert Keith as Harry Bleeker , Peggy Maley as Mildred , Hugh Sanders as Charlie Thomas , Ray Teal as Frank Bleeker , Will Wright as Art Kleiner , Yvonne Doughty as Britches , Gene Peterson as Crazy and Alvy Moore as Pigeon . For anyone who likes bikes , bikers or biking , this is the film for you . Marlon Brando was number 30 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars , he was number 11 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols , he was number 4 on 100 Years , 100 Stars - Men , and he was number 1 on The World's Greatest Actor . Very good !
573015	4248714	810958	8.0	The Magic of Jesus	I first saw Barry Jones and Stuart MacLeod on Dirty Tricks , along with stunt man Jonathan Goodwin . I liked some of their creepy sometimes cruel tricks , and they always entertained me killing Neil Fox . But this special magic show was something else , and on just after their focused person's birthday ! Basically they probably read The Bible enough times to know all of Jesus ' tricks that he performed , and obviously they want to recreate some of those magic tricks , or miracles . The examples I can remember are making a blind person see ( briefly ) , raise the dead , help catch many fish in a net , walk on water and turn water into wine , obviously . Very good !
572855	4248714	1118511	8.0	Wallace & Gromit : A Matter of Loaf and Death	It had been 13 years since we had last seen the two lovable Plastercine characters in A Close Shave , and at Christmas we were entertained by this half hour adventure . Wallace ( Peter Sallis ) and Gromit are now earning a living turning 62 West Wallaby Street into a bakery , with a windmill , many mixing machines and ovens , and " dough to door " service . Recently 12 local bakers have been murdered , Gromit seems to be concerned , but Wallace isn't worried , he's too " dough-eyed " for local beauty and bread enthusiast , Piella Bakewell ( Coronation Street's Sally Lindsay ) . It is when Gromit discovers her dark plan , yes , she is the baker killer , that she is determined to do anything to stop him ruining her plan to kill Wallace . In the end it is the two dogs , Gromit and Piella's own poodle Fluffles ( Melissa Collier ) who save the day . A welcome return , and I'm sure this film will nominated for or win another Short Animated Film Oscar for creator Nick Park . Wallace and Gromit were number 11 on The World's Greatest Comedy Characters , and they were number 15 on The 100 Greatest Kid's TV Shows , and as part of Aardman Animations , they was number 15 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons . Very good !
573139	4248714	206634	8.0	Children of Men	Based on the novel by P . D . James this is a pretty gritty vision of the future from director Alfonso Cuar√≥n ( Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban ) . Basically , it is 2027 in England , and concerns of the nation are the rise in illegal immigrants and the infertility of women . The youngest person on Earth died , at 18 years old , and human life and its morals are almost becoming extinct . Theodore Faron ( Clive Owen ) finds an underground rebel band called The Fishes , and as he goes along with these people , one of which being ( for a little while ) Julian ( Julianne Moore ) , he finds the one thing that could change the course of humanity , the first pregnant woman is 18 years ! Now he , Kee ( Claire-Hope Ashitey ) and Miriam ( Matilda's Pam Ferris ) are on the run from the Human Project , so the baby ( after it's out ) is safe . Aging hippie Jasper ( Sir Michael Caine ) helps out for a while as well in the process of this important road trip . Also starring Love Actually's Chiwetel Ejiofor as Luke . The scenes when Owen is escaping gunfire in the wrecked streets is extraordinary when it doesn't cut for at least five minutes , even with red spots flicked on the camera . It was nominated the Oscars for Best Cinematography , Best Editing and Best Writing , Adapted Screenplay , and it won the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography and Best Production Design , and it was nominated for Best Special Visual Effects . Very good !
571814	4248714	25873	8.0	Them Thar Hills	Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history , and deservedly so , so I am happy to see any of their films . With a broken leg Ollie is recommended by The Doctor ( County Hospital's Billy Gilbert ) that he and Stan should get away from the home life , so Stan has the idea that they rent a trailer and take it to the countryside . Before they get to their location , some bandits throw stolen alcohol into the near well , and after everyone is gone , Ollie and Stan soon arrive and park their trailer . As they try to get some food and coffee organised , they don't realise that there is alcohol in the water they are drinking , Ollie is sure it is the lead . Soon enough they are joined by Mr . and Mrs . Hall ( Charlie Hall , Mae Busch ) , who are looking for fuel , and while the husband sorts out their car , the wife joins Ollie and Stan getting drunk on the " healthy " mountain water . Mr . Hall realises the alcohol in the water , and he starts an argument with Ollie and Stan , and they respond covering with his hair on his chin , a plunger his forehead and some treacle or whatever and feathers , the film ends with Hall getting the last laugh though when he sets Ollie's backside alight , and he jumps into the well ! Filled with wonderful slapstick and all classic comedy you could want from a black and white film , it is an enjoyable film . Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were number 7 on The Comedians ' Comedian . Very good !
572924	4248714	884317	8.0	Star Stories	This is a really good satire comedy about the lives of well known celebrities / stars in the world . All the stories are true , but made like an episode of The League of Gentlemen , i . e . dark . Every episode they take famous celebrities known to us in Britain , whether single people or couples , and it gives us a new twist of all news we heard about them . The people they have mocked and made into genius Little Britain type characters so far are David and Victoria Beckham ( with The Spice Girls and Alex Ferguson ) , George Michael ( along with Sir Bob Geldof , Sir Elton John and Boy George ) , Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas ( with Mick Hucknall and Kirk Douglas ) , Madonna and Guy Ritchie ( with Vinnie Jones ) , Sadie Frost and Jude Law ( with Steven Spielberg and Sean Pertwee ) and Jennifer Aniston , Brad Pitt & Angelina Jolie ( with the Friends cast ) . The only member of the cast I can remember is Rhys Thomas from The Fast Show . Very good !
573185	4248714	110005	8.0	Heavenly Creatures	For a film from director Peter Jackson ( The Lord of the Rings Trilogy ) , it looks more like a gory horror film mixed with Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas in places . The fact that it is based on a true story is even more extraordinary . In their first film roles Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynskey play best friends Juliet Hulme and Pauline Yvonne ( Parker ) Rieper . They both have the same imaginations and live in their own wonderful world of " fun " . It is only when adults , especially Pauline's mother ( Sarah Peirse ) become quite concerned and tries to stop them seeing each other . Their friendship is kind of similar to lesbianism , but not completely homosexual . Anyway , when the two girls fear of being split apart , they decide they must kill the mother ! Jackson is very good at creating good drama with psychology , and excellent moments of terror or fantasy . It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing , Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen , and Jackson won the Venice Film Festival Silver Lion award . Kate Winslet was number 55 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars , she was number 2 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses , and she was number 29 on The World's Greatest Actor , and the film was number 22 on Film 4's 50 Films To See Before You Die . Very good !
571040	4248714	280778	8.0	Iris	Based on a true story , this is a really good film about one woman's life with a hard to deal with problem that his husband has to live with . BAFTA winning , and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Dame Judi Dench plays Iris Murdoch , a famous writer who makes books , most about her private thoughts and problems made into a story or autobiography like book . Iris's husband John ( Oscar and Golden Globe winning , and BAFTA nominated Jim Broadbent ) is proud of her making these books , but there are moments when living with her he cannot deal with . She suffers Alzheimer's disease , and doesn't understand what is going on , and has panics for no reason . She also has flashbacks of her life with young John , where she is played by Oscar nominated Kate Winslet , with a couple of nude scenes thrown in . Also starring BAFTA nominated Hugh Bonneville as Young John Bayley and Shaun of the Dead's Penelope Wilton as Janet Stone . I thought Broadbent stole the show , particularly with his panics , happy times , but ultimately struggling to cope with Iris . It was nominated the BAFTA for the Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film and Best Adapted Screenplay . Kate Winslet was number 55 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars , Winslet was number 2 , and Dame Judi Dench number 1 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses , Dench was number 1 on Britain's Finest Actresses , and Winslet was number 29 , and Dench number 8 on The World's Greatest Actor , and Jim Broadbent was number 23 on The 50 Greatest British Actors . Very good !
571026	4248714	44672	8.0	The Greatest Show on Earth	I've hardly ever been to a real circus , so that is one reason for me seeing this film , to see an idea of what it is like at a circus . Basically it is showing some of the personal stories between performers at the circus , the relationships they share and the lives they live for the circus . Charlton Heston as Brad Braden , the manager of The Greatest Show on Earth is quite a nice guy , but sometimes he worries about his circus performers disappointing audiences . But for me , the actor that stole most of the film , never without makeup on , was James Stewart as Buttons the Clown . He really steals the show near the end of the film when the circus train crashes and he acts as a doctor . It won the Oscars for Best Picture and Best Writing , Motion Picture Story , and it was nominated for Best Costume Design , Best Film Editing and Best Director for Cecil B . DeMille , and it won the Golden Globes for Best Cinematography , Best Director and Best Motion Picture - Drama . It was number 32 on The Ultimate Film . Very good !
571171	4248714	396323	9.0	The Games	This is one of the best kind-of reality celebrity competition shows I know . Hosted by Jamie Theakson The Games is very interesting This is the show taking a bunch of well or quite known celebrity names and making them perform sports . These sports include running / sprinting , javelin , swimming , hammer throw , diving , wrestling and many more rough and tough challenges . They have had a few good celebrities on the show . These people include : Pat Sharp from Fun House , Craig Charles from Robot Wars , Kirsty Gallagher from Ant vs Dec , Bobby Davro who I've seen in Rainbow ( who did a really nasty looking belly-flop ) and singer Javine . A very good kind-of reality challenge show . There was a special Champion of Champions episode in 2006 . It has been on all 100 Greatest TV Treats programmes so far . Very good !
571106	4248714	101143	9.0	Men Behaving Badly	I had seen many bits and pieces , mainly various outtakes on Blunder shows , and one full episode ( the final one , " Delivery " ) , and when I finally decided to get the whole lot , I was very pleased . The series started with BAFTA winning ( and nominated ) , British Comedy Award winning , and National Television Award nominated Martin Clunes as Gary Strang , Leslie Ash as Deborah and British Comedy Award winning ( and nominated ) Caroline Quentin as Dorothy , but originally Harry Enfield was the fourth member of the gang , as Dermot , but he apparently wasn't comfortable , and replacement Neil Morrissey as Tony Smart made the show what we know today . The series basically revolved around best mates Gary and Tony ( and for that first series , Dermot , but forget about him now ) who share a two bedroom home . They are two grown up men who act like kids , and spend most time either drinking in their local , at home having all male conversations ( while drinking ) , or lingering after their love interests , Gary with Dorothy , and Tony with Deborah . Also starring Ian Lindsay as George , Valerie Minifie as Anthea , Dave Atkins as Les and John Thomson as Ken , with appearances by young Catherine Tate as Young Woman , EastEnders ' Tamzin Outhwaite as Girl in Pub , Sugar Rush's Sara Stewart as Judy , EastEnders ' Amanda Drew as Wendy and EastEnders ' Lucy Speed as Chambermaid . The dialogue was good , the slapstick was good , the stories were good , and of course , Clunes and Morrissey are perfect , a good series that will never get boring , no matter how many times you've seen it . It was twice nominated the BAFTA for Best Comedy ( Programme or Series ) , it won ( and was nominated for ) the British Comedy Award for Best BBC / ITV Sitcom / Comedy , and it twice won the National Television Award Most Popular Comedy Series , and it was nominated for Most Popular Comedy Programme . Martin Clunes was number 35 on TV's 50 Greatest Stars , the episode " Performance " was number 37 on The 100 Greatest Christmas Moments , and the programme was number 16 on Britain's Best Sitcom . Very good !
572274	4248714	295297	9.0	Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets	The sequel to the highly successful family film , based on the popular books by J . K . Rowling is another great film , from director Chris Columbus ( Home Alone , Mrs . Doubtfire ) . Harry Potter ( Daniel Radcliffe ) is still living with not pleasant relatives Uncle Vernon ( Richard Griffiths ) and his Aunt Petunia ( Fiona Shaw ) and their son , and in his house he meets Dobby the House Elf ( Toby Jones ) who warns him not to go back to Hogwarts this year . Soon enough Ron Weasley ( Rupert Grint ) and his twin brothers show up in a flying blue car to take him to their place . After staying with the Weasley family , including daughter Ginny ( Bonnie Wright ) , mother Molly again ( Julie Walters ) and father Arthur ( The Fast Show's Mark Williams ) , and before going back to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry , they pop to Diagon Alley . It is there that Harry is reunited with Hagrid ( Robbie Coltrane ) , Hermoine ( Emma Watson ) and unfortunately the mean Draco Malfoy ( Tom Felton ) , with his father Lucous ( Jason Isaacs ) . When they get back to Hogwarts , with getting through Platform 9 and 3 quarters and using the blue car , and after being told off , the lessons soon continue again . Teachers include Professor Pomona Sprout ( Miriam Margolyes ) teaching magic plant handling , and new teacher of The Dark Arts , who Harry met in Diagon Alley , the " famous " Gilderoy Lockhart ( Kenneth Branagh ) . The second Quidditch game is good because Malfoy is against Harry as the new seeker . Later , terrifying things are happening to people , they are being petrified by something , and in a lesson with Professor Minerva McGonagall ( Dame Maggie Smith ) she explains about the note left on the wall , i . e . about the Chamber of Secrets . Later , Harry finds a diary belonging to someone called Tom Riddle , and through this magical book he sees a vision about who may be responsible , Hagrid ! Oh , and Harry also finds out he can talk Parceltongue , like a Slytherin student , which comes in handy when they go looking for the beast petrifying everyone , the Basilisk . The Basilisk brings death to someone if they look in it's eyes , it's only petrified those people because they didn't look at directly , i . e . reflections or through a ghost . Harry , Ron and Lockhart , who they found out stole all his stories from other wizards , erasing their memory , anyway they find the bathroom with the entrance to the chamber , and where Moaning Myrtle ( Shirley Henderson ) was killed by the beast , and Harry battles the blinded ( by the phoenix ) Basilisk , and Tom Marvolo Riddle ( Christian Coulson , his name is mixed from the words I Am Lord Voldermort ) . The film ends happily with Hermoine and the other victims revived from being petrifying , Professor Albus Dumbledore ( Richard Harris , in his last film before dying ) returns from Azkaban prison ( faulsly arrested ) , and Hagrid is applauded when Harry makes him one of the big helps . Also starring Alan Rickman as Professor Snape , David Bradley as Argus Filch and John Cleese as Nearly Headless Nick . It won the BAFTA for Best Feature Film ( Kids ' Vote ) and it was nominated BAFTAs for Best Special Visual Effects , Best Production Design and Best Sound . Harry Potter was number 45 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons , but he was also number 35 on The 100 Worst Britons ( the only fictional person , why ? ) , and the film was number 24 on The Ultimate Film . Very good !
572223	4248714	64541	9.0	Kes	I had seen the spoof of Craig David's peregrine falcon in Bo ' Selecta ! and I watched some of it in my Film Studies class when we studying independent film and here BAFTA nominated director Ken Loach , and after seeing the entire film , I can see why it is considered his best . Based on the " grim Up North " novel by Barry Hines , it tells the story of troublesome but reforming teenager Billy Casper ( BAFTA winning David Bradley , obviously , he was willing to get his clothes off ) . He is a troublemaker , but when he finds and befriends a baby kestrel , Kes , he finds solace and starts to train it to get away from his dysfunctional family and torment of school . There may not be much appearance of the bird , but this is still a good focus on a child almost anti-hero and his troubled life . The other great but horrible character is Billy's bullying older brother , Jud ( Freddie Fletcher ) who in the end is the one that ends the friendship and Billy , really cruelly and for hardly any real reason . Also starring Lynne Perrie as Mrs . Casper , BAFTA winning Colin Welland as Mr . Farthing , English Teacher , Brian Glover as Mr . Sugden , Games Teacher and Bob Bowes as Mr . Gryce , Headmaster . It was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Film , Best Screenplay and the UN Award . It was number 44 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers , it was number 26 on The 50 Greatest British Films , and it was number 28 on The 100 Greatest Films . Very , very good !
571432	4248714	299658	9.0	Chicago	This is probably one of the best musicals I have ever seen , in recent years . Mainly based in a prison , it tells the story of prisoner Roxie Hart ( Bridget Jones's Golden Globe winning , and Oscar and BAFTA nominated Ren√©e Zellweger , she should have won the Oscar for this , not Cold Mountain ) and her dream to be in Chicago shows . Based in 1930s , it basically showing Roxie's dream with music and dance , with the help of other prisoner Velma Kelly ( Oscar and BAFTA winning , and Golden Globe nominated Catherine Zeta-Jones ) . But this dream cannot come true unless she somehow gets out of prison ( for murder ) , with the help of swiss lawyer , Billy Flynn ( Golden Globe winning Richard Gere ) . Also starring Oscar , BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Queen Latifah as Matron Mama Morton and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated John C . Reilly as Amos Hart . It won the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration , Best Costume Design , Best Editing , Best Sound and Best Picture , and it was nominated for Best Cinematography , Best Director for Rob Marshall , Best Song for " I Move On " and Best Writing , Adapted Screenplay , it won the BAFTA for Best Sound , and it was nominated the Asquith Award for Film Music for Danny Elfman , John Kander and Fred Ebb , Best Cinematography , Best Costume Design , Best Editing , Best Make Up / Hair , Best Production Design , the David Lean Award for Direction and Best Film , and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy , and it was nominated for Best Director and Best Screenplay .

Very good !
572261	4248714	397306	9.0	American Dad !	Still a similar format to Simpsons , and similar formula as South Park , and from the creator of Family Guy Seth MacFarlane comes another great cartoon . Basically the meaning of the title is a Dad , Stan Smith ( MacFarlane ) that works for the CIA and will do anything to protect his country and family . Also starring MacFarlane as Roger the Alien and Greg Corbin , Wendy Schaal as Francine Smith , Scott Grimes as Steve Smith , Rachael MacFarlane as Hayley Smith and Melanie and Dee Bradley Baker as Klaus and Tony . This could nearly be funnier than Family Guy , but thankfully their both just as good . I sometimes just wish there was no Simpsons or South Park that beats this , or Family Guy . Very good !
571569	4248714	481433	9.0	Ant & Dec's Gameshow Marathon	This programme was part of ITV's 50th birthday celebrations . Hosted by Anthonty McPartlin and Ddeclan Donnelly , this series brought back classic game shows of the channel and allowed celebrity contestants to get money for their charities . The celebrities that took part were Eamon Holmes , Ruby Wax , Conations Street's William Roache , Emmerdale's Patsy Kensit , Vernon Kay , and deserved winner Carol Vorderman . The games that they played were The Price Is Right , Take Your Pick , Bullseye , Play Your Cards Right , Sale of the Century , The Golden Shot and finally Family Fortunes . It had plenty of laughs and guests , it was a perfect birthday celebration series . Very good !
571445	4248714	358471	9.0	The Fast Show Farewell Tour	The Fast Show writers and performers had probably run out of ideas , or were just getting bored . So this is the very last show that they did . It included some old favourite jokes as well as one or two brand new ones with the cast that we have grown to love in the sketch show . Paul Whitehouse plays Unlucky Alf , Rowley Birkin , Jed Tucker ( Arse ! ) , Ken ( Suit You ! ) , Chris Jackson ( I'll nick it ) , Ted and many more . Charlie Higson plays Bob Fleming , Colin Hunt , Johnny the Painter , Ralph , Swiss Toni , Mickey Disco and many more . Mark Williams , my favourite , plays Jesse , a shepherd , the headmaster , Kenneth ( Suit You ! ) , Clive Thomas ( sneezer ) and many more . Arabella Weir plays basically all the women of the show , including the lesbian clitoris researcher , No Offense and many more . Simon Day plays Dave Angel , Cal Hooper and many more . There's also Rhys Thomas in it . But where's John Thomson , he was away because his wife was having a baby . Very good final act !
571498	4248714	261475	9.0	Hollywood Greats	I started taking notice of this programme ( in 2006 ) when they really started paying attention to the fantastic actors of Hollywood . Basically for three episodes , at least twice a year , Jonathan Ross gives all all the information we would want to know about an actor / actress , and why they were / are so admired / acclaimed by other actors , and the public . The only three episodes , or rather focused stars , I have seen so far have been Harrison Ford , Jack Lemmon and Marlon Brando , but all have been really good with attention to detail concerning their histories . I really look forward to each programme and which star is going to be discussed and focused . Very good !
572164	4248714	109686	9.0	Dumb and Dumber	This is one of the best comedies by the Farrelly brothers . Jim Carrey as Lloyd Christmas and Jeff Daniels as Harry Dunne are one of the best duo I have known in a film or a comedy . Mary Swanson ( Lauren Holly ) is on the way to the airport and she leaves her briefcase on the floor . Lloyd is determined to drive 2000 miles to Aspen to return it to her . On the way Harry and Lloyd cause many hilarious problems for themselves and others . For example , when Lloyd needs the toilet they don't stop and he pees in beer bottles , a one is drunk by a cop pulling them over . This hilarious hit comedy really made Jim Carrey a favourite . Jeff Daniels is pretty good too , particularly when he drinks laxative and craps himself in a broken toilet . It was number 17 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Films . Very good !
572050	4248714	116996	9.0	Mars Attacks !	Tim Burton directs an all-star cast of actors to face a load of Martians attacking the earth . Jack Nicholson is President James Dale ( and Art Land ) , who tries to make peace with the Martians , but after two attempts he decides that they are hostile . People in the White House are trying to help him , including Prof . Donald Kessler ( Pierce Brosnan ) , General Decker ( Rod Steiger ) and Jerry Ross ( Martin Short ) . Elsewhere , people are trying to survive , e . g . Byron Williams ( Jim Brown ) is trying to get back to Louise ( Jackie Brown's Pam Grier ) and her two boys . Also , the Martians are taking people and animals , they take Natalie Lake ( Sarah Jessica Parker ) and put her head in place of her dog's . Also starring Glenn Close as First Lady Marsha Dale , Annette Bening as Barbara Land , Danny DeVito as Rude Gambler , Michael J . Fox as Jason Stone , Lukas Haas as Richie Norris , Natalie Portman as Taffy Dale , Lisa Marie ( Burton's fianc√©e at the time ) as Martian Girl , Sylvia Sidney as Grandma Florence Norrie , Jack Black as Billy Glenn Norris , Joe Don Baker as Richie's Dad and Sir Tom Jones , who was number 87 . Martians were number 27 on 100 Years , 100 Heroes & Villains . Very good !
571522	4248714	405159	10.0	Million Dollar Baby	The meaning of the title is more obvious in what is pretty much the " second half " , and it might make you cry more than The Bridges of Madison County . Personally , I think Clint Eastwood deserved his Oscar and Golden Globe for Best Director much more than Unforgiven ( even though that's great too ) , and it deserved Best Motion Picture of the Year as well . Basically Maggie Fitzgerald ( Oscar and Golden Globe winning Hilary Swank ) wants to become a professional female boxer , with the help of trainer and ex-manager Frankie Dunn ( Eastwood , Oscar nominated for acting ) . Frank for a while refuses to train a girl , and only his sidekick Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris ( Oscar winning , and Golden Globe nominated Morgan Freeman ) sees a good opportunity , but eventually Frank agrees to teach her the basics , just till she gets a proper manager . However , when a manager does come along , Frank sees that she is not remembering the techniques , and stays with her throughout all her fights . She starts well and continues , knocking many out in the first round , till she is taught to leave a knockout longer . Eevntually she reaches the bigger stadiums , and a after one or two fights , she faces the Billie ' The Blue Bear ' ( Lucia Rijker ) , the most aggressive fighter known to Frank , and she is pretty hard to beat . The unexpected ( first time you see it ) moment though is when Maggie turns with Billie looking finished , and Billie throws a final blow and Maggie lands on the resting corner chair , cracking her neck and permanently damaging her spine . This is where the film gets really emotional , as Maggie , kept alive 24 hours a day by breathing apparatus , and Frank struggling to cope with the fact that he was a little responsible for getting her to the ring . After a little while , Maggie does the unthinkable and wants Frank to kill her to end her pain ( euthanasia ) . He refuses , and to try and do it herself she bites her tongue ( twice ) , and Frank eventually decides to carry out her wish . Swank and Freeman perform worthy Oscar winning performances , Eastwood is great acting and directing , it is just essential viewing for the boxing , acting and emotional power . It was nominated the Oscars for Best Editing and Best Writing , Adapted Screenplay , and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Original Score for Eastwood ( ! ) . Morgan Freeman was number 27 , and Clint Eastwood number 18 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars , he was also number 61 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons . Outstanding !
571072	4248714	95705	10.0	The Naked Gun	Based on the TV Series Police Squad , this is another successful spoof movie with a spy , but made by the geniuses who created Airplane ! Basically it is another excellent opportunity to see complete stupidity at it's best , or worst if you think about it from the hero's point of view . Leslie Nielsen as our " hero " , Leiutenant Frank Drebin is just the perfect idiot for the job , comes up with some stupid ideas , have stupid adventures and always causes a really terrible incidence , for himself and many others involved . This character is basically what makes the film such an excellent comedy to watch nearly again and again , he just doesn't realise how idiotic he is . Two sequels followed that are almost just as funny . Detective Frank Drebin was number 47 on The World's Greatest Comedy Characters , and the film was number 14 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Films . Outstanding !
570949	4248714	21884	10.0	Frankenstein	Based on the story by Mary Shelley , this is probably the most well known of all the film adaptations , from director James Whale . Basically Dr . Henry Frankenstein ( Colin Clive ) wants to build a man made of dead bodies , so he and assistant Fritz ( Dracula's Dwight Frye ) steal a couple of bodies , and Fritz also steals an abnormal criminal brain ( after dropping the normal one ) from Frankenstein's former teacher Dr . Waldman ( Edward Van Sloan ) . Frankenstein has completed his construction , and he is ready to bring his creation to life , with the help of electrodes and the incoming storm ( lightning ) . Worried for him , Henry's fianc√©e Elizabeth ( Mae Clarke ) , along with best man Victor Moritz ( John Boles ) and Dr . Waldman go to see Frankenstein , and they too witness the experiment completion . There is movement from this creature , and a few minutes later , you see The Monster ( Boris Karloff ) in person . At first , it seems very slow and obedient , but it becomes apparent that it is very aggressive , and they have to lock in a cell , which after killing Fritz , he does manage to escape from . While Frankenstein tries to proceed with his wedding , the Monster is " playing " with a little girl , who he throws in the water thinking she will float , but in fact he drowns her , and her father joins the villagers to get the Monster . Frankenstein finds it , and it takes him to the near windmill , where Henry is thrown over the side - lucky to be alive - and it appears that the Monster is burned alive in the tower . Even with it's simplicity , it is still a creepy and influential horror film , and Karloff's image is still as iconic as ever , one of the great classics of cinema . It was number 49 on 100 Years , 100 Quotes ( " It's alive ! It's alive ! " ) , it was number 72 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments , it was number 56 on 100 Years , 100 Thrills , it was number 100 Years , 100 Movies . Outstanding !
572555	4248714	281735	10.0	Comic Relief 2001	Comic Relief 2001 had everything you could want for comedy and charity together , especially from so many generous comedians and celebrities . I'm sure you see that I've already talked about Have I Got Buzzcock's All Over . But the segments that really stuck out for me were : Ted & Ralph - New Replacement starring Paul Whitehouse , Charlie Higson and Robbie Williams . Popsters starring Lenny Henry , Simon Pegg , Rowan Atkinson , Smack the Pony's Sarah Alexander , Coronation Street's Debra Stephenson and Peter Serafinowicz . EastEnders - Who Shot Phil Mitchell Exclusive starring all the EastEnders cast and Mel Smith , Harry Enfield , Bill Oddie , Danny Baker and Smack the Pony's Sally Phillips . Celebrity Big Brother starring Davina McCall , Vanessa Feltz , Chris Eubank , Claire Sweeney and winner Jack Dee . Finally , there was the wonderful Ali G ( Sacha Baron Cohen ) interview with David and Victoria Beckham , my favourite part . Also starring Jonathan Ross , Graham Norton , Zo√´ Ball , Harry Hill , Billy Connolly ( going nude ) , Alan Partridge ( Steve Coogan ) , Peter Kay , Frank Skinner , David Baddiel and many more generous celebrities . Outstanding !
573203	4248714	105236	10.0	Reservoir Dogs	This debut from cult director Quentin Tarantino was very well received , and he was even nominated the Sundance Film Festival Grand Jury Prize Dramatic . The story may be mixed up with the continuing warehouse scene , and flashbacks of each individual group member , but you can give it a chronological order . Basically crime boss Joe Cabot ( Lawrence Tierney ) hires six criminals , strangers to each other , gives them false names so they don't get attached to each other and concentrate on job the diamond robbery . They are sure it will go without a hitch , but the police show up and the group members panic , shooting them and some civilians . The police did manage to kill two of them , the others are all getting together , slowly , in the rendezvous point ( the warehouse ) , and begin to suspect that the one member shot , slowly dying , is an undercover cop . Starring Harvey Keitel as Mr . White / Larry Dimmick , Tim Roth as Mr . Orange / Freddy Newandyke , Michael Madsen as Mr . Blonde / Vic Vega , Chris Penn as Nice Guy Eddie Cabot , Steve Buscemi as Mr . Pink , Edward Bunker as Mr . Blue and Tarantino as Mr . Brown . The film only had a $1 . 5m budget , and it took only five weeks to shoot , and it grossed millions worldwide , cool ! It was number 64 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments , for the infamous ear cutting scene with the song " Stuck In The Middle " playing ( juxtaposition ) . The other great song of the film is " Little Green Bag " when introducing the actors and opening credits . Harvey Keitel was number 53 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars . Outstanding !
573062	4248714	74285	10.0	Carrie	Director Brian De Palma ( The Untouchables , Scarface ) adapts the first Stephen King book to the screen very well indeed . It is a very convincing creepy story of a very troubled girl . Basically this is the story of Carrie White ( Oscar nominated Sissy Spacek ) , the non-threatening ( until threatened ) girl that is horribly treated by other people . Carrie doesn't know it until she researches , but when she gets angry she can create incidents , i . e . telekinesis . Her psychotic religious mother Margaret ( Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Piper Laurie ) punishes her for some of the smallest things , that could be part of why she has developed this power too . Anyway , she goes to the prom , and she doesn't know it , but the girl who hates her most has planted a bucket of pig's blood above the stage , and she gets it poured over her head , during her winning moments as the prom's Queen , that is when Carrie goes insane . She makes doors close , people get electrocuted , ceilings collapse and kill people , and a car crash and blow up . When she gets home , her mother does too go insane , and ends up with her daughter having to kill her , and the house finally coming down on them . But it doesn't end there , there is a final moment where Carrie's mourner places flowers , and Carrie's bloody arm lunges out of the rubble , a nightmare , that probably haunts her for ages . Also starring Amy Irving as Sue Snell , William Katt as Tommy Ross , Betty Buckley as Miss Collins , young John Travolta as Billy Nolan , Halloween's P . J . Soles as Norma Watson and One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest's Sydney Lassick as Charlie Cheswick ( same surname as Cuckoo's Nest ) . A very disturbing but brilliantly creepy film . It was number 46 on 100 Years , 100 Thrills , and it was number 27 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments . Outstanding !
572055	4248714	78748	10.0	Alien	Director Sir Ridley Scott here creates one of the best science-fiction films ever made , with some horror , action and thriller moments thrown in . Basically , the commercial towing vehicle , Nostromo , is heading back to Earth , when they receive an SOS signal from a nearby planet , and they are under obligation to investigate . They have a bad landing , but three of the crew members , Dallas ( Tom Skeritt ) , Lambert ( Veronica Cartwright ) and Kane ( BAFTA nominated John Hurt ) leave the ship to investigate . There they discover a hive colony of unknown creatures , the computer message was not an SOS , it was a warning . One of the eggs is disturbed , and a parasite ( face hugger ) attacks and attaches itself to Kane's face . Dallas and Ash ( Sir Ian Holm ) do try to get it off , but it's defense mechanism of acid for blood and the possibility of killing Kane ( because it is feeding him oxygen ) stops them . Soon though , he seems fine and this creature has detached and died . The pinnacle scene is where all the crew have dinner , and Kane starts coughing and struggling in pain , till his stomach suddenly gushes blood , and the alien ( or Xenomorph ) is born ( looking pretty phallic ) . It grows very quickly , and Brett ( Harry Dean Stanton ) is first to be attacked by the big , double-mouthed , acid dribbling alien . The crew plan to kill the creature and escape in the shuttle , and one by one die trying to find it . Ash also grossly reveals himself to be a android with the " special order " to bring this alien to Earth for scientific discovery . Eventually the other crew members , Lambert and Parker ( Yaphet Kotto ) are killed , till the commanding officer , Ripley ( BAFTA nominated Sigoureny Weaver ) ( who grew a bigger character as everyone else died ) is the lone survivor , along with cat Jones , and sets the Nostromo to self destruct and escapes in the shuttle . The alien was not destroyed though , but eventually she gets it out of the blast door , sucked into outer space , and blasted by the shuttle rockets . She concludes by making a report of the situation , with hope she will be picked up by the company , and she and Jones go into the pod for hibernation . I have also seen the 2003 Director's Cut version , but the only real major change is seeing Dallas cocooned , and a few chats , and many interesting scenes and moments cut out , I think the original version is much more interesting and essential . It won the Oscar for Best Visual Effects , and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration , it won the BAFTAs for Best Production Design and Best Sound Track , and it was nominated for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music for Jerry Goldsmith , Best Costume Design and Best Editing , and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score . Sigourney Weaver was number 20 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars , John Hurt was number 27 on The 100 Greatest British Actors , Ellen Ripley was number 8 ( Hero ) and The Alien number 14 ( Villain ) on 100 Years , 100 Heroes and Villains , the film was number 6 on 100 Years , 100 Thrills , it was number 4 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments , it was number 11 on Film 4's 50 Films To See Before You Die , and it was number 36 on The 100 Greatest Films . Outstanding !
571830	4248714	462233	10.0	Comic Relief Does University Challenge	This was part of the long night of entertainment for Comic Relief 2003 , but I have only seen highlights of it . Angus Deayton hosted the special celebrity edition of University Challenge . The guests that appeared in this show were Clive Anderson , David Baddiel , Danny Baker , Jeremy Beadle , Stephen Fry , Frank Skinner , Johnny Vaughn and Gina Yashere . Basically they just played it like University Challenge , except they added comedy humour to it , since it was Comic Relief . I remember that it was Danny Baker's team that won , I would have thought it would have been Stephen Fry . Outstanding comedy entertainment as part of Comic Relief 2003 !
571957	4248714	47396	10.0	Rear Window	Oscar nominated Sir Alfred Hitchcock has created another masterpiece , my second favourite after Psycho . Basically L . B . " Jeff " Jefferies ( the great James Stewart ) is the reporter who is spending his last weeks in his apartment with a broken leg , and all he can do to pass the time is stare out the window watching his neighbours enjoying the hot weather ( with no blinds down ) . During his time though , he is occasionally visited by the nurse Stella ( Thelma Ritter ) , and his model girlfriend , Lisa Carol Fremont ( the beautiful Grace Kelly ) . While he is watching the individual occupants of the windows , he has given them all nicknames and is consumed by their private dramas . But one particularly window has caught his attention , when Lars Thorwald ( Raymond Burr ) is looking very suspicious with knives , saws and ropes , going out late at night , and his nagging wife has disappeared . Jeff is convinced that he has murdered his wife , and is constantly trying to watch the action , and prove Throwald's guilt . Det . Lt . Thomas J . Doyle ( Wendell Corey ) is convinced he is overreacting , but more and more incidents with Thorwald make Jeff , and you ( the audience ) believe this accusation . The best moments are when Jeff gives Thorwald a note and a phone call , the investigation of the patio , and the concluding fight . Hitchcock's cameo is the man in the songwriter / pianist's studio winding a clock . It was nominated the Oscars for Best Cinematography , Best Sound and Best Writing , Screenplay , and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source . Grace Kelly was number 86 , and James Stewart number 12 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars , Stewart was also number 3 on 100 Years , 100 Stars - Men , Kelly was number 13 on 100 Years , 100 Stars - Women , Stewart was number 13 on The World's Greatest Actor , Hitchcock was number 75 , and Kelly number 92 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons , the film was number 14 on 100 Years , 100 Thrills , and it was number 42 on 100 Years , 100 Movies . Outstanding !
571602	4248714	52905	10.0	The Hound of the Baskervilles	I have seen the Basil Rathbone version , and personally this remake from British Hammer ( Horror ) Studios deserves it's 10 points ( and five stars from critics ) because it is much more exciting ( especially in colour ) , from director Terence Fisher ( Dracula : Prince of Darkness ) . Basically , the Baskerville Manor has had many members of the family being victim to a legendary creature , known as the Hound of Baskerville , and the opening scene with Sir Hugo Baskerville ( David Oxley ) is an example of this monster . Famous detective Sherlock Holmes ( Star Wars ' Peter Cushing ) and his assistant Dr . John Watson ( Andr√© Morell ) are brought in to investigate , and keep an eye on who seems to be the last family member , Sir Henry Baskerville ( Christopher Lee ) . As characters ignore the rule of stay away from the moors after dark , more clues emerge in the investigation , and Holmes thinks he is getting closer to finding who , or what is responsible for these attacks and deaths . In the end , there really was a hound ( dog-type creature , I expected a werewolf ) , and Cecile Stapleton ( Marla Landi ) , " feary " daughter of Stapleton ( Ewen Solon ) is part of this terror that hunts the family on the moors , she is also victim to die when the hound is killed and the case is solved . Also starring Francis De Wolff as Dr . Richard Mortimer , Miles Malleson as Bishop Frankland and Dad's Army's John Le Mesurier as Barrymore . Cushing and Morell make a great double act as Holmes and Watson , Lee is good as Sir Henry , and the film has great moments of case solving and questioning with the many clues that pop up . The line I was hoping to hear , " Elementary , my dear , Watson " was in it , and it is number 65 on 100 Years , 100 Quotes . Outstanding !
571736	4248714	109707	10.0	Ed Wood	I have always liked director Tim Burton films ( here he was nominated the Cannes Film Festival Golden Palm Award ) , and this biography showing his love for classic sci-fi films is another terrific example of his distinctive style . We saw him in Edward Scissorhands , and then Golden Globe nominated Johnny Depp played director Edward D . Wood . If you have heard of Wood , he considered himself a great director of great films , mostly horror , but in fact he was voted one of the worst film directors of all time . He also had a habit for dressing as a woman , ever since childhood . Anyway , this film basically shows the process of making his ridiculous and utterly awful films , and relationships with people , including his wife ( for a while ) , Dolores Fuller ( Sarah Jessica Parker ) , his new girlfriend Kathy O'Hara ( Patricia Arquette ) , and his favourite actor that he worked with , Dracula's Bela Lugosi ( Oscar and Golden Globe winning , and BAFTA nominated Martin Landau ) . Also starring Jeffrey Jones as Criswell , Vincent D'Onofrio as Orson Welles , Bill Murray as Bunny Breckinridge , Mike Starr as Georgie Weiss , Lisa Marie ( Burton's fianc√©e at the time ) as Vampira and Juliet Landau ( Martin's daughter ) as Loretta King . Landau is fantastic , Depp is funny and there are some fantastic giggles . It won the Oscar for Best Makeup , it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Make Up / Hair , it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy / Musical . Johnny Depp was number 22 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars , he was number 9 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols , and he number 2 on The World's Greatest Actor . Outstanding !
572054	4248714	90605	10.0	Aliens	Director James Cameron ( Terminators 1 + 2 , Titanic ) brought the superlative sequel to Sir Ridley Scott's science-fiction action horror thriller seven years later , and in terms of spectacle , this is much more elaborate . Basically , Ripley ( Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Sigourney Weaver ) is finally picked up by her company , 57 years later , which shocks her , she also has many nightmares of her past experience . But she soon agrees with Carter Burke ( Paul Reiser ) who asks her to be an adviser ( " that's all " ) when a team of heavily armed soldiers are going to the unknown planet ( LV-426 ) Ripley and the Nostromo landed on , which has over the years she has been in hibernation , been colonised ( i . e . made breathable atmosphere and buildings made ) . Their mission seems to be to destroy the aliens ( or Xenomorph ) after contact with the planet is lost , but Ripley is eventually dragged into the action as more and more of the soldiers are being killed . Along the way , they finds a survivor , Rebecca ' Newt ' Jorden ( Carrie Henn ) , and not long after they are stranded on the planet , with no communication to the company , and no shuttle to escape . They do make sure that the doors are secure so the aliens , and parasites ( facehuggers ) cannot get in , while android Bishop ( Lance Henriksen ) tries to get a shuttle to pick them up . They do eventually get close to escape , but Ripley , looking for captured Newt does get to meet the mother alien , destroy her egg nest and sack , before escaping and the place being destroyed . There is one final encounter with the alien mother not long after landing to safety , where in the Exosuit " power-loader " , uttering the great line " Get away from her , you bitch ! " Eventually she gets rid of the alien mother by throwing her into the blast doors and forcing her into outer space ( just like the first one ) . In the end , injured Cpl . Dwayne Hicks ( The Terminator's Michael Biehn ) , ripped-up Bishop , Newt and Ripley are the last survivors , all put into pods for hibernation . Also starring Bill Paxton as Pvt . Hudson , William Hope as Lt . Gorman , Jenette Goldstein as Pvt . Vasquez , Al Matthews as Sgt . Apone , Mark Rolston as Pvt . Drake and Wishmaster's Ricco Ross as Pvt . Frost . The special effects are much more impressive , and the action more intense and gripping , a brilliant sequel . I have also seen the extended 2 and a half hour version , that director Cameron prefers , but the extra material is either unnecessary or ridiculous , e . g . Ripley's dead grandma daughter , and where Newt came from , the original version is much more interesting and essential .

Written by and starring BAFTA and British Comedy Award nominated Leigh Francis as Avid Merrion and many famous masked faces .

He also plays Craig David , The Bear , Mel B , Michael Jackson , Davina McCall , The Osbournes , Sir Elton John , Jonathan Ross ( or " Woss " ) , Vernon Kay , Marilyn Manson , Will Young , Gareth Gates , Jordan or Jodie Marsh's tit , Harry Hill , Kat Slater and many more hilarious and gross celebrities .

572854	4248714	17136	10.0	Metropolis	It was in my book " 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die " , I knew it was a silent film , but when I got the opportunity to try it , I am very pleased I did , from director Fritz Lang ( M , The Big Heat ) . I should mention the film was originally 2 hours and 23 minutes in length when it was released , much of the footage has been lost , but with what has remained , this shortened ( 1 hour and 59 minutes ) version of the sci-fi masterpiece is still an inspiration . Anyway , set in the future ( 2000 , or 2026 , both of which far away back then ) in the city of Metropolis , and the humans are divided into two groups : thinkers ( who enjoy the life in the city , not knowing how anything works ) , and the workers ( who run the city from underground , and achieve all the goals ) . One thinker , Freder ( Gustav Fr√∂hlich ) , son of the city's running man John Fredersen ( Alfred Abel ) , dares to go below after following his love interest Maria ( Brigitte Helm ) , and after experiencing their world for himself , he joins her cause to try and get both worlds together . Meanwhile , Freder's father discovers scientist C . A . Rotwang ( Rudolf Klein-Rogge ) has created a robot , that will take the form of Maria , to get control of the underworld back , and get Freder out the way . The real Maria is imprisoned by Rotwang , while her copy is appearing on stage ( in the city ) as an exotic dancer . Unfortunately the Maria copy returns to the underworld , and plans for all the workers to rebel , and destroy the " Heart Machine " that powers the city . Neither Freder nor Grot ( Heinrich George ) , the machine's foreman , can stop them , and as a result , the machine is destroyed , and the city becomes flooded with both revolting workers and water . In the end , Grot and all the workers finds Maria , who the hold responsible , and they burn her to death , thankfully , it was her copy , and her creator Rotwang also gets what he deserves , and Freder fulfils his role as the " Mediator " . Also starring Fritz Rasp as Slim , Theodor Loos as Josaphat and Erwin Biswanger as worker 11811 . The visuals are magnificent , costing back then an estimated $1 , 300 , 000 ( imagine how much that would be in today's money ) , the cityscapes , underground caverns and little special effects are wonderful to look at , the iconic robot ( which inspired the look for C-3PO in Star Wars ) looks great , and the film features brilliant music by Gottfried Huppertz , one of the best influential silent films ever made . Outstanding !
570917	4248714	759926	10.0	Lee Evans : XL Tour Live 2005	I saw him live on stage when he did this tour , so I was obviously going to buy this show on DVD . I thought I heard Lee Evans on Jonathan Ross that he was thinking of quitting comedy , but I was obviously wrong , he returned with this fantastic huge audience stage stand up show . He is still creating some fantastic , true to life and utterly hilarious jokes with both his mouth and his body . Some of the best moments are when he is using his body to do the talking , and he is sweating like mad . When I saw him on stage he was brilliant , and nothing compares to stage , but this straight-to-DVD show is just as good as seeing him in person . Lee Evans was number 23 on 100 Greatest Stand-Ups , and he was number 14 on Britain's Favourite Comedian . Outstanding !
