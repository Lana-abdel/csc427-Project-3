572681	4248714	277371	1.0	Not Another Teen Movie	The title says it all , I just don't whether it means " Oh no , not another teen movie " or that this really isn't another teen movie , but either sounds fine . This isn't really one of the best teen films I have ever seen , it hardly has any decent gags , it picks on other teen movies , e . g . American Pie , Road Trip , and it only has one or two recognisable faces . They obviously take the names of popular film characters , e . g . Oz turned into Ox , and place them into a really bizarre school . They even allow a foreign exchange student to wear no clothes ! The two faces I recognise in this are Melissa Joan Hart also known as Sabrina , The Teenage Witch , and Mr . T . Trust me , you wouldn't like it , apart from some nudity and disgusting behaviour , e . g . an old woman and teenage girl snogging ! Poor !
572743	4248714	155975	1.0	Psycho	If you want an example of a reason remakes to classic films shouldn't always be made , then this is the perfect , almost comedic example . Director Gus Van Sant ( To Die For , Good Will Hunting ) hoped to create a more modern version of Sir Alfred Hitchcock's most celebrated film , and it just doesn't work . It is almost completely word-for-word and scene-for-scene , with the big differences being it is more modern , in colour and well known actors . You know the story , Marion Crane ( Anne Heche ) steals cash , goes to the Bates Motel , meets and gets shaky with Norman Bates ( Dodgeball's Vince Vaughn ) , he murders her in the shower , he dumps her , the car and the cash in the swamp , detective Milton Arbogast ( William H . Macy ) investigates and gets murdered , Marion's sister Lila ( Julianne Moore ) and lover Samuel ' Sam ' Loomis ( The Lord of the Rings ' Viggo Mortensen ) go to the motel , and you find out the mother is dead , and Bates is mother . Also starring Robert Forster as Dr . Fred Simon , Bruce Almighty's Philip Baker Hall as Sheriff Al Chambers , Liar Liar's Anne Haney as Mrs . Eliza Chambers , Roy Brocksmith as Man in Cowboy Hat outside Realty Office ( who was Hitchcock ) and Gus Van Sant as Man Talking to Man in Cowboy Hat . I can think of many reasons why this film is crap : crap acting , Norman Bates seems more kooky , almost camp , he even masturbates when looking through the peep hole ( unlike Anthony Perkins ) , stupid flash-frames during the murders , the shower scene , meant to be the best moment of the film , is the worst ( especially when instead of seeing the shower curtain torn off , you see Heche's ass ) , a less decomposed ( looks like The Mummy or something ) and just a weird remake . I can admit I liked how almost completely like the original it was in places , and it is quite good to see for a laugh , to see just how awful it is , but it is never going to be as good as Hitchcock's . Poor !
572851	4248714	205461	1.0	Thomas and the Magic Railroad	I used to love the TV series as a kid , I almost never missed it , so I decided to see this film both to see if there was any resemblance , and why the critics hate it , from director Britt Allcroft ( who created the show ) . Basically the supply of gold dust , for travel between Shining Time and the island of Sodor , is running out for Mr . Conductor ( Alec Baldwin ) . It doesn't help when Thomas the Tank Engine ( Edward Glen ) and friends are being attacked by the nasty Diesel 10 ( Neil Crone ) , who also wants to find the missing train Lady ( Allcroft ) and the Magic Railroad it runs on . Trying to help the situation are Mr . C's slacker cousin ( Michael E . Rodgers ) , new friend Lily ( slightly deeper voiced Mara Wilson ) , and her grandpa Burnett Stone ( Peter Fonda ) , who has lost his belief in the magic of Lady . That's about it . Also starring Cody McMains as Patch , Grease's Didi Conn as Stacy Jones , Crone as Gordon , Colm Feore as Toby , Linda Ballantyne as Percy , Kevin Frank as Bertie the Bus , Harold the Helicopter and Henry , Susan Roman as James and Shelley Skinner as Annie and Clarabel . No Fat Controller ! ? Maybe if Ringo Starr or Michael Angelis had returned to do all the characters voice , it could have improved it the tiniest bit . Then again , nothing can improve the ridiculous story , the stupid acting , the dreadful songs , and the feel that it is nothing like the TV series , even if it looks the same , it's just one of the worst TV adaptations ever . Very poor !
572772	4248714	79550	1.0	Meteor	This is a disaster movie from director Ronald Neame ( The Poseidon Adventure ) , but the real disaster is just how much this film sucks . Basically a comet / asteroid / meteor ( whatever you want to call it ) is heading for a collision for Earth , and obviously it could extinguish mankind if it hits . So the authorities want to combine the nuclear capabilities of both theirs and Russia's fire power to destroy the rock . People involved in the mission , in whatever way , are Dr . Paul Bradley ( Sir Sean Connery ) , Tatiana Nikolaevna Donskaya ( Natalie Wood ) , NASA's Harry Sherwood ( Karl Malden ) , Dr . Alexei Dubov ( Brian Keith ) and Maj . Gen . Adlon ( Martin Landau ) . Also starring Trevor Howard as Sir Michael Hughes , Richard Dysart as Secretary of Defense , Henry Fonda as the President and Roger Robinson as Hunter . What makes this film so awful is there is hardly any effort in the acting , well , they kept their faces straight . There's that ridiculous scene where everyone is getting covered in mud in the subway , and all the model rockets and the rock are not convincing enough , because you can tell their models , especially with the crappy explosions . Just one of the most terrible films I have ever seen . It was nominated the Oscar for Best Sound ( it shouldn't have been nominated for any ! ) . Very poor !
571041	4248714	63135	1.0	Inspector Clouseau	I think you know the main reason why I have rated this film one star , just like the further films after his death , it does not have Peter Sellers in the starring . Instead they have an idiotic Alan Arkin ( Little Miss Sunshine's Oscar winning actor ) as Chief Inspector Jacques Clouseau . He is not funny , he does not have the same clumsiness and slight idiocy , and I think he was pretty rubbish as the accent . If he did the cartoons however , then it should of just been left like that and not make him into live action . Also I can't remember what the mission actually was in the film , so no wonder he is rubbish . Also starring Worzel Gummidge's Geoffrey Bayldon as Gutch , although that doesn't help . Poor !
573209	4248714	118688	2.0	Batman & Robin	This is one of the worst films I've seen , the other three Batman films ( especially the first one ) were better than this . Arnold Schwarzenegger plays Mr . Freeze , he cares too much about his wife , but that's obviously the point for him being evil . George Clooney plays Batman , when he is Bruce Wayne he is just the tiniest bit corny . Chris O'Donnell plays Robin , he needs to take a chill pill because he gets so stressed out with Batman saying that he can't trust him . Uma Thurman plays Poison Ivy , she is pretty I suppose but she talks too much , and she obviously cares more about her plants and flowers than anything else . Alicia Silverstone plays Batgirl , okay looking I suppose , but could of done a bit more . Also starring Pat Hingle as Comissioner Gordon and Michael Gough as Alfred . The rest is obviously no good action with okay fights . It's just a rubbish superhero film . Batman was number 84 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons . Adequate !
572378	4248714	83475	2.0	Scooby and Scrappy-Doo	After the success of Scooby-Doo , Where are You , they decided to give Scooby and Shaggy their own show . But unfortunately , they added a new character that spoilt Scooby-Doo success forever . They invented a new show with a new title , Scooby and Scrappy-Doo . It was Scrappy-Doo that made this show a complete failure , probably for both adults and kids together . Scrappy was the stupid brave puppy that always looked ready to beat someone up . Scooby and Shaggy were getting scared of the villain , and they were also trying to stop him . Scooby-Doo doesn't need any little annoying bastard puppy nephews . If they wanted Scooby-Doo to be more successful , they should have either killed or never thought up Scrappy . This was just poor , maybe your kids will prefer it !
571510	4248714	95403	2.0	Police Story 2	This sequel starring and directed by Jackie Chan again fails to have the same impact as it's predecessor . Basically , with his unorthodox police methods , Jackie is demoted to be a traffic cop . Despite this , the villain from the last film who he put away is now out , and has vowed to make his life a misery . While he is harassing Jackie and his girlfriend May ( Maggie Cheung ) , the police are thinking of bringing Jackie back to help fight a group of bombers who are asking for a $10 million ransom . Also starring Bill Tung as Inspector Bill Wong , Kwok-Hung Lam as Superintendent Raymond Li and Charlie Cho as John Ko . I think the biggest problem is that this film is too chatty , with hardly any comedy , hardly any decent martial arts fights , no relevant thrills , and not enough action or stunt work by Chan , it's no surprise that I dozed off towards the end . Pretty poor !
571094	4248714	338459	2.0	Spy Kids 3-D : Game Over	I saw this on TV , so I didn't have any 3D glasses ( although I did for a few minutes find a way , the blue and red wrappers in Quality Street , but it got annoying ) , then again , I dunno if I'd want to see a full 84 minutes in 3D , imagine your eye sight for a while . Basically Juni Cortez ( Daryl Sabara ) is alone at home , and realises that his sister Carmen ( Alexa Vega ) has been kidnapped by the new villain , the Toymaker ( a ridiculous Sylvester Stallone , although I hadn't seen him for a little while , he deservedly won a Razzie ) . She is trapped inside a real video game that he has created , and with the help of some technicians , Juni has to go in and get his sister out bu passing the many levels , and be careful not to lose too many lives . He does this with the help of his crippled Grandfather ( Star Trek II : The Wrath of Khan's Ricardo Montalban ) , well , he's not crippled in the game world of course , and some other kids trying to get out with him . He manages to rescue Carmen and the other kids , but there is a brief moment where unseen ( apart from special glasses ) monsters are attacking , and with the help of other characters from the two previous films have to defeat them , and then the Toymaker . Also starring Antonio Banderas as Gregorio Cortez , Carla Gugino as Ingrid Cortez , King of the Hill and Beavis and Butt-Head creator Mike Judge as Donnagon Giggles , Salma Hayek as Cesca Giggles , Richard ' Cheech ' Marin as Felix Gumm , Danny Trejo as Machete , Alan Cumming as Fegan Floop , Men in Black's Tony Shalhoub as Alexander Minion , Steve Buscemi as Romero , Bill Paxton as Dinky Winks , George Clooney as Devlin and Elijah Wood as The Guy . You can tell even without 3D glasses which moments " stick out " ( LOL ) , but this is not an impressive film . Stallone is too kooky as four personalities , there is no real story , the chat is too corny , and only kids will enjoy it , it is just stupid . Pretty poor !
572296	4248714	87078	2.0	Conan the Destroyer	I heard that the original film , Conan the Barbarian , was meant to be a pretty good film , especially for Arnold Schwarzenegger starting his career . I think this was Schwarzenegger's second or third film after the good success of The Terminator , but it is not one that goes in his greatest films list . Conan is on a really weird mission to become king or something . He is accompanied by a load of people to help him " destroy " something . One person includes a boyish looking ( as always ) Grace Jones as Zula . The story is pretty rubbish , I can'r remember seeing any decent fight scenes , and Schwarzenegger is a lot better in The Terminator , being evil . Pretty poor , as far as I remember !
573003	4248714	245674	3.0	Thir13en Ghosts	I had heard of this film and one of it's female stars ( from the popular teen comedies series ) , I guess I wanted to know why the critics give two out of five stars , but it's no surprise if it's from director Steve Beck ( Ghost Ship ) . Basically Arthur Kriticos ( Men in Black's Tony Shalhoub ) and his family , daughter Kathy ( American Pie's Shannon Elizabeth ) and son Robert ' Bobby ' ( Alec Roberts ) , along with nanny Maggie Bess ( singer Rah Digga ) have been left a large by recently killed relative Cyrus Kriticos ( F . Murray Abraham ) . They immediately like what they could be living in , but it only lasts a few minutes as Bobby quickly disappears , and one by one , they see ghosts . Cyrus was not just a collector of beautiful artifacts , but of spirits , twelve to be exact , thirteen being Cyrus himself ( I presume ) . Trying to help the family get out alive , stop the machine " designed by the devil and powered by the dead " and free the spirits , are ghost hunter Dennis Rafkin ( Scream's Matthew Lillard ) and his rival Kalina Oretzia ( Matilda's Embeth Davidtz ) . Also starring J . R . Bourne as Benjamin Moss and Matthew Harrison as Damon . The effects are pretty lame , there is only one reasonable death scene , and the performances are very lousy , well , so is the film . I have to say I recognised much of the footage being spoofed in Scary Movie 2 , and to be honest , I couldn't take the real ( remake ) film too seriously . Adequate !
572104	4248714	156200	4.0	Babar	When I was younger I used to like elephants , especially in cartoons . This was a very simple cartoon with some short and simple stories involving all the characters , but it was still good . Babar in his childhood had his mother shot by hunters , but he was rescued and looked after by an old woman . As he grows up he learns to dress , walk and talk like a gentleman . Soon many elephants are like this and they build their own place out in the country . Because Babar was the one that started it he was soon to be known to these elephants as the King Babar . Throughout the series Babar helps people with problems and runs his elephants well . It's only the rhinos that aren't too keen on the elephants . It was number 81 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons . Okay !
572198	4248714	113119	4.0	Elke	This is a mediocre story about a family starting to break a part . The father and husband Jeff ( C . T . Miller ) is bored with life , the mother and wife Linda ( Griffin Drew ) misses her husband's company , and their teenage daughter ( played by young Lisa Boyle ) is disrespectful and always with her boyfriend . Then a beautiful friend of the wife comes to visit and stay , Elke ( Shauna O'Brien ) . She starts to notice the family's problems while staying . Eventually it starts to get interesting as this " friend of the family " starts to seduce them , and it almost helps them get back together . A pretty silly story , but worth a look for the nudity content . There is quite a tender and arousing lesbian scene between Elke and Linda . Okay !
571450	4248714	171363	4.0	The Haunting	I always wondered which haunted house film was spoofed in Scary Movie 2 , and renamed Hell House , now I know , and I can definitely see why it should be spoofed . From the director of Speed , Jan De Bont , it is a remake of the 1963 film , where a bunch of people are placed in the isolated house to study sleep disorders and problems , and obviously it turns out to be to find ghosts . Basically Eleanor ' Nell ' Vance ( Ransom's Lili Taylor ) is called to meet with Dr . David Marrow ( Liam Neeson ) and three other people at Hill House for a research stay . The people that look after the house , Mr . Dudley ( Bruce Dern , Laura Dern's Dad ) and Mrs . Dudley ( Home Alone 3's Marian Seldes ) say that no-one will be around and no-one can hear them , duh ! These other three people , Theo ( not renamed in SM2 , played by Catherine Zeta-Jones ) , Luke Sanderson ( Owen Wilson ) and that one that gets her eye slashed , obviously settle better , but as more and more bizarre and spooky things happen in the house , mostly to Nell , she finds out the secrets behind the previous people of the house , including Hugh Crane , his wife and their children they never had . I really liked all the sequences that are memorably spoofed in SM2 , e . g . the door knocker , the ghost crawling in the bed , Crane on the stairs , and if you have the SM2 DVD , the deleted scene with more than just eye slashing . Okay !
571672	4248714	113161	4.0	Get Shorty	Most of this film is a bit confusing to understand and just the tiniest bit pointless , and unfortunately not all of it makes me laugh . But there are moments of interest when the stars are talking about the nature of films . Golden Globe winning John Travolta as Chili Palmer is pretty good at being serious about making the film , Get Shorty , Gene Hackman was okay as Harry Zimm , Rene Russo as Karen Flores hardly did much , Danny DeVito as Martin Weir is a good actor who played Napoleon and plans to star in this film and Delroy Lindo as Bo Catlett is pretty good too . Altogether this is a weird " comedy " from Men in Black director Barry Sonnenfeld . It was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Screenplay and Best Motion Picture - Comedy / Musical . Adequate , in my opinion !
571882	4248714	117765	4.0	Striptease	Taking off her clothes was quite a popular thing , so somebody thought , why don't we get Demi Moore to do it throughout a whole film . The result a higher pay for Moore , more flesh than usually shown and a rather silly script / story . Anyway , Erin Grant ( Moore ) needs to get a job that earns a lot of money so she can have proper custody of her little girl , so she decides to become a stripper in a rather popular Las Vegas type club . She earns loads of money from using really good Annie Lennox songs and the power to dance and flash her flesh . Also starring the really stupid Burt Reynolds as Congressman David Dilbeck , Pulp Fiction's Ving Rhames as Shad and Terminator 2's Robert Patrick as Darrell Grant . Personally , it is only worth seeing for the nudity content . Okay !
572845	4248714	265298	4.0	Big Fat Liar	I suppose I can see why critics give this film two out five stars , it isn't fantastic , but I think it is worth a look , from director Shawn Levy ( Cheaper by the Dozen , Night at the Museum ) . Basically 14-year-old Jason Shepherd ( Malcolm in the Middle's Frankie Muniz ) is often lying to his parents and teachers , and his teacher warns him that if he doesn't do his creative writing , he will fail his whole semester and have to repeat the grade during summer . So he completes his work , but getting a lift from Hollywood producer Marty Wolf ( Paul Giamatti ) , who hit him on the way to school , he manages to leave his paper with the story " Big Fat Liar " in the car . He finds out from a movie trailer that Marty stole his paper and is turning it into a major movie , so he and his best friend Kaylee ( She's the Man's Amanda Bynes ) are on a mission to prove Jason is for once telling the truth . Marty of course is too nasty and smug to give Jason's father Harry ( Michael Bryan French ) a phone call , and he evens burns the " Big Fat Liar " paper . So now Jason and Kaylee are determined to make Marty's life as hellish as possible , until he agrees to call Jason's Dad . They put blue dye in his swimming pool , and orange hair dye in his shampoo , and much more naughty pranks creating chaos for Marty's career . There is the obvious point when Jason looks like he wants to give up , but don't worry , all characters that despise Marty help out in the final operation , and with Jason's parents coming , he wants to finally prove his truthfulness , and boy does he deliver , big style . Also starring Amanda Detmer as Monty Kirkham , Lee Majors as Vince , Donald Adeosun Faison as Frank Jackson , Sandra Oh as Mrs . Phyllis Caldwell , Russell Hornsby as Marcus Duncan , Christine Tucci as Carol Shepherd and American Pie's John Cho as Dustin ' Dusty ' Wong . Muniz is likable , Byrnes proves a very surprisingly talented support , and even though he is wasting his time and talent a little , Giamatti is great at being nasty . It is a kids film , so if it seems corny , cheesy or predictable , just keep that in mind , and try to enjoy the performances and slapstick . Okay !
573117	4248714	293508	4.0	The Phantom of the Opera	Based on the stage show by Lord Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber ( creator of Cats , Jesus Christ Superstar and Joseph ) and directed by Joel Schumacher ( Falling Down ) , I was hoping this to be a little better , but it wasn't completely rubbish . Basically at the French Opera Populaire house the manager has left and been replaced . They are having problems though with the leading diva refusing to perform , due to the mysterious Phantom ( 300's Gerard Butler ) . Eventually the new diva Christine ( Golden Globe nominated Emmy Rossum ) meets this man in person , and he is obviously in love with her . The rest of the story is mainly The Phantom demanding an opera for him , trying to get Christine to love him , showing his deformed face behind that white mask , and an ending of despair ( that I can't remember ) . Also starring Patrick Wilson as Vicompte Raoul De Chagny , Miranda Richardson as Madame Giry , Minnie Driver as Carlotta , Ciarán Hinds as Richard Firmin , Simon Callow as Gilles Andre , Victor McGuire as Piangi , Brookside's Jennifer Ellison as Meg Giry , Murray Melvin as Reyer and James Fleet as Lefevre . To be honest , the only memorable song for me was " The Phantom of the Opera " , which before this I saw Rhydian on The X Factor perform ( he was great ) , the rest of the film isn't really my thing . It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction , Best Cinematography and Best Song for " Learn To Be Lonely " ( also nominated the Golden Globe ) , and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy . Okay !
571130	4248714	248667	5.0	Ali	From director Michael Mann ( The Last of the Mohicans , Collateral ) , I hoped this would be a good biographical drama with a great star playing one of the world's best known boxers . The film tells the story of Muhammad Ali ( Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Will Smith ) , aka Cassius Clay / Cassius X , who in 1964 won the heavyweight title , creating anew image for African American sportsmen . The film then follows his journey competing in many other fights with self confidence and belief that he is the best boxer in the world , his two marriages , his conversion to the Islam religion , a relationship with Malcolm X ( Mario Van Peebles ) , and concluding with the monumental fight against George Foreman ( Charles Shufford ) . Also starring Jamie Foxx as Drew ' Bundini ' Brown , Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Jon Voight as Howard Cosell , Ron Silver as Angelo Dundee , Casino Royale's Jeffrey Wright as Howard Bingham , Mykelti Williamson as Don King , Jada Pinkett Smith ( Will's wife ) as Sonji , Nona Gaye as Belinda Ali , Michael Michele as Veronica Porche , Terminator 2's Joe Morton as Chauncey Eskridge , Paul Rodriguez as Dr . Ferdie Pacheco ; Giancarlo Esposito as Cassius Clay , Sr . ; LeVar Burton as Martin Luther King , Jr . , Albert Hall as Elijah Muhammad , Michael Bentt as Sonny Liston , James N . Toney as ' Smokin ' Joe Frazier , Barry Shabaka Henley as Herbert Muhammad , Ted Levine as Joe Smiley and Star Trek : The Next Generation's Michael Dorn as Black Pilot . While Smith does a very convincing impression of Ali , and a nearly unrecognisable Voight does well too , it doesn't really focus on all events in a lot of detail , apart from the fights , so I agree with the critics that it is a pretty ordinary film . It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score for Lisa Gerrard and Pieter Bourke . Will Smith was number 51 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars . Worth watching !
573053	4248714	136640	5.0	The Forgotten Toys	If you've seen the mini Christmas movie then you would know what this is , it's basically a TV series about the teddy bear and doll still on the lookout for new kids to be owners . Joanna Lumley is still the okay Annie ( or " Pigtails " to Teddy ) the doll with her ragged skirt , and Bob Hoskins is still the lovable and humorous Teddy . Throughout the series they had many interesting adventures . They tried to be won at a fayre , they caught some burglars , they were stolen by a horrible kid and many more . To be honest I didn't watch it all the time , but when I did it was pretty okay . Bob Hoskins as Teddy is just the best part of the whole show . Worth watching !
572514	4248714	167190	5.0	Hellboy	From director Guillermo del Toro ( Pan's Labyrinth ) , this is another not too bad comic book based hero brought to the screen . The film begins in 1944 , during World War II , and the Nazi Germans are researching the occult , and the villain Grigori Rasputin ( Karel Roden ) has spent 5 years building an huge portal machine which he intends to use to bring out a monstrous God of Chaos . When Rasputin eventually dies from using too much of his power , the machine ( activated ) shoots out a creature of the world intended , a red devil looking creature , and researcher Trevor ' Broom ' Bruttenholm ( John Hurt ) is determined to raise " Hellboy " to do good . Sixty years later , Broom is dying of old age , and FBI agent John Myers ( Rupert Evans ) is sent to pretty much help him , and his two legendary friends , obviously Hellboy ( Alien : Resurrection's Ron Perlman ) and aquatic creature Abe Sapien ( Doug Jones ) . They are defending the city , battling crooks through alleys , streets and subways , while trying also to protect friends , including Hellboy's love interest Liz Sherman ( Selma Blair ) , who is learning to control her power of making fire from her body . Eventually , Rasputin returns from his grave , and threatens the city with his many ugly and almost indestructible creatures . Also starring Jeffrey Tambor as Tom Manning . I can agree the film loses some speed towards the very end , and there are those annoying getting to know each other and stuff like that moments ( sentimentality ) , but it still not a bad film . Worth watching !
571214	4248714	122718	5.0	Small Soldiers	This is quite an interesting idea , toys that can play back , or rather go completely wrong , not be stopped and create chaos , from director Joe Dante ( Gremlins ) . Basically Irwin Wayfair ( Scary Movie 2's David Cross ) and Larry Benson ( Cherry Falls ' Jay Mohr ) pitch ideas to Hartland / Globotech boss Gil Mars ( Denis Leary ) , and he creates the toys that can play with kids and run forever . These are The Commando Elite and The Gorgonites ( the Small Soldiers ) with the slogan " Everything else is just a toy " . Unfortunately these toys break out and create a war , and only Alan Abernathy ( Gregory Smith ) and his love interest Christy Fimple ( Kirsten Dunst ) , with the help of The Gorgonites , lead by Archer ( Frank Langella ) , can stop the really mean Commando Elite , lead by Chip Hazzard ( Tommy Lee Jones ) . Also starring Ann Magnuson as Irene Abernathy , The Simpsons ' Phil Hartman as Phil Fimple , Ernest Borgnine as Kip Killagin , Jim Brown as Butch Meathook , Bruce Dern as Link Static , George Kennedy as Brick Bazooka , Clint Walker as Nick Nitro , This Is Spinal Tap's : Christopher Guest as Slamfist and Scratch-It , Michael McKean as Insaniac and Freakenstein and Harry Shearer as Punch-It , Sarah Michelle Gellar and Christina Ricci as Gwendy doll , and Scary Movie's Cheri Oteri as Globotech Telephone Operator . Worth watching !
572046	4248714	66319	5.0	Ryan's Daughter	I was unsure if I could survive all three hours of the film , but the good cast list and BAFTA nominated director Sir David Lean ( The Bridge on the River Kwai , Lawrence of Arabia ) , directing his penultimate film , kept me going . To be honest , I was hoping for a film with much more plot , or at least more interesting things going on . Set in a bleak Irish village in 1916 , the main story is basically Rosy Ryan ( Oscar , BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Sarah Miles ) marrying Charles Shaughnessy ( an unusual role for Robert Mitchum ) , after a little while she has an affair with shell-shocked officer Major Randolph Doryan ( Christopher Jones ) . In the story there are also some visits from military officers , and in the end , for some reason I don't know Rosy and Charles decide to leave and go to Dublin . To be honest , the only character I couldn't help but like was an Oscar and Golden Globe winning , and BAFTA nominated performance by an unrecognisable Sir John Mills as the dumb , limping , tatty and rotten toothed village idiot Michael . Also starring Golden Globe nominated Trevor Howard as Father Collins , The Omen's Leo McKern as Thomas Ryan , Barry Foster as Tim O'Leary , Arthur O'Sullivan as Mr . McCardle , Marie Kean as Mrs . McCardle , BAFTA nominated Evin Crowley as Maureen , Gerald Sim as Captain , Philip O'Flynn as Paddy , Niall Toibin as O'Keefe , Niall O'Brien as Bernard , Owen Sullivan as Joseph and Brian O'Higgins as Constable O'Connor . It is just a random film to me with no real meaning , I can't understand why the critics give it five stars , besides the good performances , I would probably need to see again to appreciate it much more , but I doubt that's going to happen , because it was so boring . It won the Oscar for Best Cinematography , and it was nominated for Best Sound , and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Art Direction , Best Cinematography , Best Costume Design , Best Film Editing , Best Sound Track and Best Film . Sir John Mills was number 38 on The 50 Greatest British Actors . Worth watching , at least once , in my opinion !
571705	4248714	65377	5.0	Airport	From director George Seaton ( the original Miracle on 34th Street ) , you can't really watch this film without thinking about Airplane ! which spoofed moments of it very well . Basically it all takes place in an airport ( duh ! ) , and it sees many characters getting on with whatever they do in airports . These include airport manager Mel Bakersfeld ( Birdman of Alcatraz's Burt Lancaster ) , plane pilot Capt . Vernon Demerest ( Dean Martin ) , and constant plane stowaway Ada Quonsett ( Oscar winning Helen Hayes ) . There is a lot of chat for a while , but the disaster movie element really kicks off after the plane of the film has taken off . Mrs . Quonsett is discovered to be a stowaway , but instead of punishing her , they instead get her to help get a man out of his seat . This man is a bomber , carrying an explosive in a briefcase , and just after trying to be convinced to give it to Demerest , the man locks himself in the toilet , and blows himself up . Luckily , the plane stays in the air after a few seconds of cabin pressure , and all they have to do now is land the plane safely . Also starring Jean Seberg as Tanya Livingston , Jacqueline Bisset as Gwen Meighen , Golden Globe nominated George Kennedy as Joe Patroni , Van Heflin as D . O . Guerrero ; Golden Globe winning , and Oscar and BAFTA nominated Maureen Stapleton as Inez Guerrero , Barry Nelson as Capt . Anson Harris , Dana Wynter as Cindy Bakersfeld , Lloyd Nolan as Harry Standish , Barbara Hale as Sarah Bakersfeld Demerest and Gary Collins as Cy Jordan . The only good bit of the film is the bomber explosion on the plane , the rest of it is just too chatty for it's own good , but I suppose you could try it , but Airplane ! is much more entertaining . It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration , Best Cinematography , Best Costume Design , Best Film Editing , Best Music for Alfred Newman , Sound , Best Writing , Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium for Seaton and Best Picture , and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Original Score . Worth watching , at least once !
571005	4248714	303816	5.0	Cabin Fever	I can agree with the critics that it is similar to the same formula as past horror films , e . g . Night of the Living Dead with the last survivor being shot accidentally ( or on purpose ) , and The Evil Dead with the isolated cabin , but I think it is quite a good . It is a pretty gritty and gross horror film , especially from debuting director Eli Roth ( Hostel ) . The film starts with a guy finding his dog dead with no insides and blood going in his face , and then it moves to the main plot . Five teenagers , Paul ( Rider Strong ) , Karen ( Jordan Ladd ) , Bert ( James DeBello ) , Marcy ( Cerina Vincent ) and Jeff ( Joey Kern ) have graduated school , and have rented a cabin in the woods to spend a short sex and alcohol filled vacation . While there , they see the guy at the beginning who has caught a terrifying flesh-eating disease / virus . When they set him on fire , you see him dead in the lake , and this is where the bigger problem comes , his disease filled fluids drain into the drain pipes of the cabin . Slowly , one by one , the virus spreads in all of them with the water coming from the lake , and it turns into a horrific terror-fest as the friends turn on each other , and try to get help from the situation and the disease . Also starring Arie Verveen as Henry ( The Hermit ) , Robert Harris as Old Man Cadwell and Roth as Justin ( aka Grim ) . The scene where one of the girl shaves herself in the bath , and her skin is pealing to blood is particularly horrific , and many other moments are pretty realistic . Worth watching !
571263	4248714	113368	5.0	I Like to Play Games	A pretty silly film , but worth watching the nudity . A new secretary has entered a company , and this guy finds her attractive . It's not long before they sleep together . But she doesn't want to " play it easy " . So she starts to do more interesting things . For example , she dresses in a cat-suit and pins him to the bed and says " You just lie back and let me do everything ! " Probably the most arousing and watchable moment of the film is when the girl brings a friend or something round to be with him instead of her . But it's obvious that she doesn't want this " friend " to b with him alone , so they have a very good threesome . As I said , a silly script , but definitely worth it . Good !
572942	4248714	338580	5.0	Baby Looney Tunes	I saw this a couple of times on Cartoon Network , I wasn't too fascinated about it at first with the advert , but when I actually bothered to watch it Baby Looney Tunes is actually pretty good . Basically they've taken the same idea as Tiny Toon Adventures and Baby Muppets , and done it to the Looney Tunes . They are now babies being looked after by Granny in a large house of fun . Baby Bug Bunny is cute and main star , but I don't think he's as popular as the original adult . There's also babies Daffy , Porky , Sylvester , Tweety , Lola Bunny ( from Space Jam ) , Taz and many others . The babies have many weird and wonderful stories , including doing chores to get money for ice cream , tidying the house and toy arguments . The kids will love it . Good !
573198	4248714	64782	5.0	Paint Your Wagon	I have to admit two of the only reasons I wanted to see this film was because of the great actor we got to know in the spaghetti westerns singing , and The Simpsons spoofed it . Basically from a cart accident , prospector Ben Rumson ( Golden Globe nominated Lee Marvin ) and Michigan farmer Pardner ( Clint Eastwood ) form a partnership in No-Name Village in the California gold country . They have a couple of adventures as the almost slow plot goes , including buying and sharing a wife , Elizabeth ( Jean Seberg ) , hijacking a stage , kidnapping six prostitutes ( so the village had more women , they originally had none ) , and turning the village into a boomtown . Filled with plenty of gambling , drinking and singing , and some creative gold mining . It was a slow film when there was no singing , but it is still a good film , and both Marvin and Eastwood are great at singing . Lee Marvin in fact was number one for the song " Wandrin ' Star " . It was nominated the Oscar for Best Music for Nelson Riddle , and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical / Comedy . It was number 57 on The 100 Greatest Musicals . Worth watching !
572745	4248714	109279	5.0	Black Beauty	I had read the reviews for this story of one of the most famous fictional horses in literacy , and this film adaptation is the only one so far that has a decent star rating ( all others are two , this is three ) , from director Caroline Thompson ( scriptwriter of Edward Scissorhands ) . Anyway , basically Black Beauty ( voiced by Alan Cumming ) tells his own stories of all his mini adventures , being given to many different masters , making many friends , doing many services for them , and ultimately his " circle of life " over many years . His mini adventures include being born , learning to stand and run , his name given , given hooves , being sold to new masters , a fire , falling in love , becoming sick , riding people , and much more . Starring Sean Bean as Farmer Grey , Dragonheart's David Thewlis as Jerry Barker , Jim Carter as John Manly , Peter Davison as Squire Gordon , Alun Armstrong as Reuben Smith , John McEnery as Mr . York , Eleanor Bron as Lady Wexmire and Peter Cook as Lord Wexmire . Kids , especially young girls , will adore this film , and there is some interest for the older viewers as well in this heartwarming drama . Worth watching !
571182	4248714	471019	5.0	Magnificent 7	This is the only TV drama I have actually seen with Helena Bonham Carter away from the big screen , especially with her husband Tim Burton . This is the true story based on the life of Jacqui Jackson and her seven children . Carter plays Maggi Jackson , the troubled mother happy to do nearly anything for her kids , especially because of their problems . The four boys of the family are the main reason why she is quite troubled , they all have social problems , e . g . Asperger's Syndrome , Hyperactivity . You can obviously sympathise with this mother because it is based on a real person . I can also kind of sympathise with the kid with Asperger's Syndrome , not just because I have it , but I know what it's like to be different and sometimes alone . Worth watching !
572910	4248714	113501	5.0	Just Cause	I will admit I didn't pay full attention to this when it was on , but I did get the gist I needed to , and I suppose it isn't bad . Basically law professor Paul Armstrong ( Sir Sean Connery ) is given a letter by Evangeline ( Ruby Dee ) , grandmother of Bobby Earl ( Blair Underwood ) , and he wants him to prove his innocence . Bobby claims to be wrongly convicted for the kidnap , rape and murder of an 11-year-old girl , committed eight years ago , and he faces the electric chair . So the rest of the film is mainly Paul , with some help from Sheriff Tanny Brown ( Laurence Fishburne ) , questioning the suspects from all those years ago , including imprisoned criminal Blair Sullivan ( Ed Harris ) . It has some red-herrings along the way , and it turns out in the end that Bobby did have something to do with it after all , and he kidnaps Paul's wife Laurie Prentiss Armstrong ( Indiana Jones and the Temple of the Doom's Kate Capshaw ) and daughter Katie ( little and recognisable Scarlett Johansson ) near the end for the final showdown . Also starring Christopher Murray as Detective T . J . Wilcox , Daniel J . Travanti as Warden and Ned Beatty as McNair . Connery is always likable with that Scottish accent , even in a small role Harris adds some needed kick , and the story isn't too bad , from what I paid attention to anyway , not bad . Worth watching !
572404	4248714	20708	5.0	Brats	Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history , and deservedly so , so I am happy to see any of their films . Stan and Ollie are trying to have a quiet evening playing checkers and pool , but they are having to deal with the antics of their mischievous sons ( played by themselves ) as they squabble over building blocks , try to play hide and seek , and break a vase , which obviously gets them sent to bed . Ollie tells them ( for quiet ) the quickest to get dressed for bed gets a nickel , but of course , Ollie falls down the stairs tripping on a roller skate , and Little Ollie manages to swallow the nickel . Then a mouse starts more trouble , and Ollie's backside is shot , and then liniment pours on it , and he ends up falling in the bath water ( used to cool it ) . Finally , the shower is turned on , and door shut , while Ollie sings to the boys to get them to sleep , and they ask for water , it ends with the room flooding from the bathroom door . Filled with good slapstick and all classic comedy you want from a black and white film , at just over an hour , it is an enjoyable film . Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were number 7 on The Comedians ' Comedian . Worth watching !
571652	4248714	109781	5.0	Faust	For mainly a Czech film , this is a good surreal film with interesting puppet and stop motion sequences . I can really only work out most of the beginning , where Petr Cepek as Faust is given a map in the street from some guy . He ignores this at first , but eventually he is convinced to go to where the map points out something in red . In this place which seems to be a theatre of some sort , there are many of surrealist events that ( for me ) make hardly any sense . It seems to be Faust has been given some powers and rule over the many puppet and clay characters , or something like that . It ends with him running out ( like the previous visitor ) , and getting run over . All voices by Andrew Sachs . Worth watching !
571883	4248714	335438	5.0	Starsky and Hutch	Based on the really popular action TV series with the two pretty known names , this film is based on it , and with two good comedian actors playing the heroes makes it nearly bigger . Basically David Starsky ( Ben Stiller ) and Ken ' Hutch ' Hutchinson ( Owen Wilson ) are partnered up to investigate some robberies or something , all involving the rich bastard like Reese Feldman ( Dodgeball's Vince Vaughn ) . He was voted one of The 100 Greatest TV Characters by Channel 4 , and now Snoop Dogg plays the much loved Huggy Bear . He is pretty good at being cool , but I can't tell whether he likes them or hates the heroes sometimes . Also starring Road Trip's Amy Smart as Holly and Baywatch's Carmen Electra as Staci . Worth watching !
570956	4248714	289765	5.0	Red Dragon	Apparently this is a remake of the Michael Mann / Hannibal film Manhunter , and it is the prequel to The Silence of the Lambs , from director Brett Ratner ( Rush Hour ) . The film obviously opens with Dr . Hannibal Lecter ( Sir Anthony Hopkins , reprising his Oscar winning role a third time ) attempting a brutal murder after detective Will Graham ( Edward Norton ) realises he is behind some cannibalistic murders . Years later he is brought out of early retirement by detective Jack Crawford ( Harvey Kietel ) to help catch another killer , known to authorities as ' The Tooth Fairy ' . Will tries to get clues to finding this killer from the man he put away and made him retire , Lecter . What the cops don't know is that ' The Tooth Fairy ' , or Francis Dolarhyde ( Ralph Fiennes ) has been getting inside information about Will and his family secretly from Lecter . When we do eventually see who ' The Tooth Fairy ' is , we also see the " Red Dragon " , a large tattoo on his back , based on a piece of art . Also it appears he might be wanting to let go of his evil personality because of blind love interest Reba McClane ( Emily Watson ) . In the end Dolarhyde is killed by Will , and Lecter has got away with his part , and of course , it ends at the moment he is informed a female investigator wants to see him , he asks " what's her name ? " , and that's when it ends ( it's obvious it's Clarice Starling ) . Also starring Mary-Louise Parker as Molly Graham , Philip Seymour Hoffman as Freddy Lounds , The Silence of the Lambs ' Anthony Heald as Dr . Frederick Chilton , Frankie Faison as Barney Matthews , Tyler Patrick Jones as Josh Graham , Lalo Schifrin as the Conductor , Saw's Ken Leung as Lloyd Bowman and Home Alone 3's Christopher Curry as Mr . Fisk . Not much effort has been made with make up to make Hopkins and Heald look the age they do in 1991 , the gore is good , but that's pretty much it , I thought Hannibal was more interesting to watch . Worth watching !
572070	4248714	110527	5.0	Miracle on 34th Street	For a Christmas film this is quite a nice children's film where someone tries to prove the existence of Santa Claus , and that Kris Kringle ( Lord Sir Richard Attenborough ) is him . Kringle is hired as a Santa Clause in a local department store by Dorey Walker ( The Flintstones ' Elizabeth Perkins ) to bring more children and customers in , and it works . But there are those who hate him sometimes , especially when he suggests other stores to shop at . After a while lawyer Bryan Bedford ( Dylan McDermott ) , also in love with Dorey , wants to help Dorey's young daughter Susan ( Mara Wilson ) have a Dad , and prove that Kringle is Santa . The reason the case came up by the way was because Kringle hit someone for calling him names . They won the case because of a dollar bill with the words " In God We Trust " , I'm not sure if that is the original film conclusion . I think Attenborough and Wilson are the only reasons that this film works , but I really need to see the original . Worth watching !
572461	4248714	110478	5.0	Maverick	From director Richard Donner ( The Omen , Lethal Weapons 1-4 ) , this did look like quite a fun western , and I noticed some good names in the cast , so I was certainly going to try it . Basically Bret Maverick ( Mel Gibson ) is hoping to save up $25 , 000 to enter the big Winner Takes All poker tournament , and he is $3000 off the amount he needs . While trying to get the rest of the money , and practising his poker skills , Bret meets Annabelle Bransford ( Jodie Foster ) , a cunning con artist , and they seem to be quite a match . Bret is making one or two enemies , including with Angel ( Spider-Man 2's Alfred Molina ) , but after a long while of missing opportunities of money , and some fights , Bret does raise the money for the game . The full prize for the winner is a full $1 , 000 , 000 , and in the end , Bret does win with a royal flush , but Marshal Zane Cooper ( James Garner , played Bret Maverick in the original TV series ) decides to take the money himself , only for us to find out he is Bret's father in the end . Also starring Graham Greene as Joseph , James Coburn as Commodore Duvall , Dub Taylor as Room Clerk , Geoffrey Lewis as Matthew Wicker , Paul L . Smith as The Archduke , Dan Hedaya as Twitchy - Riverboat Poker Player , The Goonies ' Corey Feldman as Bank Robber and Lethal Weapon's Danny Glover as Bank Robber . Gibson is likable as the lead character , Foster has her small moments , and it is mainly the poker games that are most fun to watch . It was nominated the Oscar for Best Costume Design . Worth watching !
571320	4248714	335345	5.0	The Passion of the Christ	Forget A Clockwork Orange , The Evil Dead , The Exorcist , Monty Python's Life of Brian and many of the other controversial films , this " labour of love " from Braveheart actor / director Mel Gibson is the most controversial film I have ever seen . In Latin and Aramaic it tells the story of the last 12 hours of Jesus Christ ( James Caviezelon ) on Earth , from the betrayal of Judas ( Luca Lionello ) in the Garden of Gethsemane after the Last Supper , till his crucifixion . It starts slow , but when Jesus is sentenced to death for " blasphemy " the controversy picks up . Jesus being scourged ( whipped ) by sticks , and by sharp-ended strings on his back , and his front , are horrifying to watch for the amount of blood and scars , and it is the son of God . Then carrying of the cross to the mountain , and after many falls he getting help from a stranger . Then it ends with the nailing of the Messiah's hands and feet , and propped to die . There is a slight happy ending though with the resurrection before the credits . Also starring Maia Morgenstern as Mary , Christo Jivkov as John , Francesco De Vito as Peter and Giacinto Ferro as Joseph of Arimathea . If you decide to watch this one day , be warned that it is very hard to deal with , and you can see why churches refused it . The fact that the film was re-released with 15 minutes of violence was cut out to make it a 15 didn't help . It was nominated the Oscars for Best Cinematography , Best Makeup and Best Music for the powerful score by John Debney . It was number 94 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers for Jesus's carrying of the cross mixed with Mary's flashbacks of him as a child . Worth watching , at least once !
572433	4248714	141005	6.0	Famous Fred	When I was a kid I used to think this was quite a funny and interesting like story about a cat becoming a star of singing . It looks like the same animation as The Snowman , but it doesn't make you cry as much . Basically , a cat named Fred who belonged to Nick and Sophie . They soon find out Ginger and many others cats are holding a tribute and funeral to their star . Kenneth the hamster tells the story of why Fred was so famous . He first started as a present for Mum , then he grew to become the cats favourite singing sensation . He soon became known as Famous Fred . It's such a shame he died , or did he , he had one of nine lives left ! Lenny Henry as Fred is just perfect . It was nominated the Oscar and BAFTA , both for Best Short Film , Animated . Good !
573093	4248714	52427	6.0	tom thumb	When I was a kid this used to be a really good old fantasy film about a boy the size of a human thumb and the adventures he had . Basically husband and wife Jonathan ( Bernard Miles ) and ( Jessie Matthews ) wish they could have a son , a small one . That is exactly what they get , they get their wish granted by the Forest Queen ( June Thorburn ) . Tom Thumb ( Russ Tamblyn ) is the young thumb sized kid who has many adventures . He befriends the fairy's boyfriend , Woody ( Alan Young , aka DuckTales ' Scrooge McDuck ) , helps two robbers skinny , gap-toothed and moustached Ivan ( BAFTA nominated Terry-Thomas ) and fat , stupid and greedy Antony ( Peter Sellers ) , flies a balloon , uses dancing shoes , and catches the robbers , and lives happily ever after with everyone else . It won the Oscar for Best Special Effects , and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical . Good !
571318	4248714	92099	6.0	Top Gun	There are many critics that call this an ultimate gay fantasy film , in some ways I can see why . From the director of Enemy of the State , Tony Scott , this is an air navy based film set almost in a cold war . Pete " Maverick " Mitchell ( Tom Cruise , in his star-making role ) is one of many aspiring fighter pilots to become the best of the best , with the help of the Top Gun Naval Flying School . There he both tries to establish himself as one of the best , has some quarrels with other pilots , particularly Tom " Ice / Iceman " Kazansky ( Val Kilmer ) , and in the process of trying to gain trust and merit , falls for civilian instructor Charlotte " Charlie " Blackwood ( Kelly McGillis ) . There is a point where he quits momentarily when his co-pilot Nick " Goose " Bradshaw ( ER's Anthony Edwards ) , but he does get the great merit at the ending for destroying most of the Russian enemy . Also starring Alien's Tom Skerritt as Commander Mike " Viper " Metcalf , Total Recall's Michael Ironside as Dick " Jester " Wetherly , Tim Robbins as Sam " Merlin " Wills and Meg Ryan as Carole . It won the Oscar Best Song for " Take My Breath Away " ( also won the Golden Globe ) , and it was nominated for Best Sound Effects Editing , Best Film Editing and Best Sound , and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score for Harold Faltermeyer . Tom Cruise was number 32 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars , he was number 25 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols , and he was number 81 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons , the film was number 94 on 100 Years , 100 Quotes ( " I feel the need - the need for speed ! " ) , and it was number 18 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments . Good !
571776	4248714	39689	6.0	Build My Gallows High	I would have to see again and pay a lot more attention than I think I did , especially to understand why the critics give it five out of five , but what I can remember was pretty good , from director Jacques Tourneur ( Cat People ) . Basically Jeff Bailey , aka Jeff Markham ( Robert Mitchum ) has his past come back to him when he is ordered to see gambler Whit Sterling ( Kirk Douglas ) . On his way there , he tells his girlfriend Ann Miller ( Virginia Huston ) his story , and obviously a flashback shows this . Jeff was once a private eye hired by Sterling to spy on his mistress Kathie Moffat ( Jane Greer ) , who shot Whit and got away with $40 , 000 . He finds her in Acapulco , and she ( being delectable ) makes him forget about Sterling , and they have a bit of a passion for each other . Back to the present , Whit's new job for Jeff is a trap , but he is cautious . Also Rhonda Fleming as Meta Carson , Richard Webb as Jim ' Jimmy ' , Steve Brodie as Jack Fisher , Paul Valentine as Joe Stephanos , Dickie Moore as The Kid and Ken Niles as Leonard Eels . There were one or two moments of interest , but until I see it again properly , I can't give high praise for it . Worth watching !
572513	4248714	65938	6.0	Kelly's Heroes	I had heard many people say that this was a really good film , so I decided I couldn't give it a miss , and I can see reasons to recommend it . Set in the Second World War , the Americans have captured a German Colonel , but an artillery barrage hits the camp before they can talk to him . Ex-Lieutenant Pvt . Kelly ( Clint Eastwood ) catches the Colonel , and he gets him drunk , this is how he learns of a secret mission he can go on to ship $16 , 000 , 000 worth of gold bullion that is meant to go to France . Kelly invites many of his fellow soldiers that are interested in being part of this mission to slip into enemy territory and get this fortune . As they travel , they encounter one or two small battles , a mine field and a few near misses , before the final bigger battle in a town square , where the gold is , but it was kind of obvious they would get the gold and live richly ever after ( LOL ) . Also starring On Her Majesty's Secret Service's Telly Savalas as MSgt . Big Joe , Toy Story's Don Rickles as SSgt . Crapgame , Carroll O'Connor as Maj . Gen . Colt , Donald Sutherland as Sgt . Oddball ( tank commander ) , Gavin MacLeod as Moriarty ( tank crewman ) , Hal Buckley as Capt . Maitland , Stuart Margolin as Pvt . Little Joe , Jeff Morris as Pvt . Cowboy , Richard Davalos as Pvt . Gutowski , Perry Lopez as Pvt . Petuko , Tom Troupe as Cpl . Job and Harry Dean Stanton as Pvt . Willard . The battle scenes are quite gripping , the actors all have their moments , this is quite a lot of fun for a not very conventional war film . It was number 34 on The 100 Greatest War Films . Good !
572742	4248714	171804	6.0	Boys Don't Cry	I recognised the poster , then I watched some of the film in Film Studies class , and I was very interested in seeing the whole thing . Writer / director Kimberley Peirce started this project first with a documentary ( or it might have been her short film ) based on the true story of a young girl from Nebraska who disguised herself as a man , and was raped and murdered , and then Peirce got the go-ahead to make this independent film . Teena Brandon ( then rather unknown , Insomnia and Million Dollar Baby star , Oscar ( her first ) and Golden Globe winning , and BAFTA nominated Hilary Swank ) dressed as a man , mostly to get used to the idea of what it would be like to be one before her operation . She called herself Brandon Teena , and with her new persona made some male friends , including John Lotter ( Peter Sarsgaard ) , Tom Nisson ( Brendan Sexton III ) and Lonny ( Matt McGrath ) , and some female ( the sex was now more attracted to ) including Kate ( Alison Folland ) , Candace ( Alicia Goranson ) , and of course , the girl that she would fall in love with Lana Tisdel ( Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Chloë Sevigny ) . The film basically sees Teena / Brandon making a convincing life as a man , getting a girlfriend that after finding out is pretty much okay with it , and the only person that knew before was her brother Brian ( Rob Campbell ) . Soon enough though , the male characters find out her secret and first exploit it to others , then rape her , and in the end it was John that murdered her , maybe accidentally , maybe intentionally for her / his lies . The rape scenes are very disturbing , and the murder is tragic , this is a very convincing performance from Swank as the hero ( ine ) , and a gripping film . Good !
572605	4248714	44953	6.0	The Naked Spur	On TV , it was either this western , or the apparently rubbish fantasy film by Sir Ridley Scott starring Tom Cruise called Legend , and I think I made the right decision . From director Anthony Mann ( Winchester ' 73 ) , this western sees Howard Kemp ( James Stewart ) meet Jesse Tate ( Millard Mitchell ) , and then sheriff Roy Anderson ( Ralph Meeker ) . He doesn't explain why for a little while , bu Howard is looking for and trying to catch wanted criminal Ben Vandergroat ( Robert Ryan ) , and when he catches him after a little gun battle , along with Lina Patch ( an attractive Janet Leigh ) , he reveals the high reward for Vandergroat's capture , and they all ( apart from Lina ) make a deal to split the reward when they reach the town . On the journey they encounter disagreements , a great Indian battle that ends with Howard hallucinating from a gun wound , and the film ends with all but Howard and Lina dying , and eventually forgetting the reward completely ( for love , duh ) . Typical and predictable in a couple of places , but still a good film , and obviously I love almost anything with James Stewart ( one of my most favourite actors ) . Good !
571995	4248714	1267289	6.0	The Kevin Bishop Show	Do you remember Kevin Bishop as Jim Hawkins in Muppet Treasure Island , well , he first came to our screens in Star Stories , and now he has his own sketch show . This sketch show is basically a channel hopping concept where he spoofs many celebrities , programmes and adverts , along with his other co-stars James Howick ( Peep Show ) , Oliver Maltman ( Star Stories ) and Katie Miles ( The IT Crowd ) . Celebrities impersonated include Gordon Ramsay , Jonathan Ross , Ross Kemp , Justin Lee Collins , Colin Farrell , Christopher Walken ( by Maltman ) and some rappers , spoof programmes include Nursery Crime Squad , ' Allo ' Allo and Pimp My Ride , and spoof adverts include Playbox , celebrity perfumes , film trailers and Daily Mail DVD giveaways . A good show with some funny moments from a new up-and-coming comedian . Good !
573044	4248714	261392	6.0	Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back	I had seen a few bits of them in Clerks , part of the " New Jersey Trilogy " along with Mallrats and Chasing Amy , an appearance in Scream 3 , and a return in Dogma , but I had never seen one of the proper films from director Kevin Smith , and I'm glad the first film of his I did try starred his most popular characters in their own movie . Basically the star slackers , dope-smoking , jive-talking Jay ( Jason Mewes ) and Silent Bob ( Smith himself , only uttering a few words somewhere in the middle ) have discovered their book alter egos Bluntman and Chronic are having a movie made about them by Miramax , but they are getting bad hate mail ( about the characters , and their real names ) , and they are now heading from Jersey to Hollywood to stop the movie being made . On the way , Jay meets the love of his life with Justice ( American Pie's Shannon Elizabeth ) , who along with Missy ( Jennifer Schwalbach Smith , Kevin's wife ) , Sissy ( True Lies ' Eliza Dushku ) and Chrissy ( Final Destination and Heroes ' Ali Larter ) plan to steal a bunch of diamonds . The cops are on their tails , including Federal Wildlife Marshal Willenholly ( Will Ferrell ) , who is only brought in when a primate / monkey ( whatever ) is stolen , and " The Clit " , lol . One of the reasons this film is fun to watch , besides the in-jokes , small spoofs and bad language ( yes , the swearing is very funny ) is because of the numerous cameo appearances of well-known actors who aren't afraid to send themselves up . These include Ben Affleck , My Name Is Earl's Jason Lee , The Breakfast Club's Judd Nelson , George Carlin , Star Wars ' Carrie Fisher , American Pie's Seann William Scott , Tracy Morgan , Good Will Hunting director Gus Van Sant , Chris Rock , Jamie Kennedy , Scream director Wes Craven , Shannen Doherty , Mark Hamill , American Pie's Jason Biggs , Matt Damon and Dawson's Creek star James Van Der Beek . It also featuring the number one single from Afroman , " Because I Got High " , Jay and Silent Bob naturally feature in the music video . Good !
570943	4248714	117438	6.0	Ransom	Quite a thrilling film about a father's struggle with the loss , or rather finding , of his son . Young Sean Mullen is at the park with his Dad , and Mum on stage . He suddenly goes missing , and they discover when they get home that he has been kidnapped . He is being ransomed for $2 , 000 , 000 by the great villain , fake Detective Jimmy Shaker ( Gary Sinise ) . Tom Mullen ( Golden Globe nominated Mel Gibson ) , Sean's Dad is determined to do everything he can to get his son back . He eventually after a failed ransom drop-off decides to offer the money to capture the kidnapper ! Also starring Rene Russo as Kate Mullen , Sean's Mum , Delroy Lindo as Agent Lonnie Hawkins , Liev Schreiber as Clark Barnes and Saw II's Donnie Wahlberg as Cubby Barnes and Evan Handler as Miles Roberts . A good film from director Ron Howard ( Splash , A Beautiful Mind ) . Mel Gibson was number 17 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars . Good !
571570	4248714	121765	6.0	Star Wars Episode II : Attack of the Clones	Continuing the prequels to the original trilogy , Anakin Skylwalker ( Hayden Christensen ) has grown up , and is now learning apprentice to Obi-Won Kenobi ( Ewan McGregor ) . In this film , the Queen has quit , and is now Senator Padmé Amidala ( Natalie Portman ) , and is endangered by bounty hunter , later identified as Jango Fett ( Temuera Morrison ) , and it is Anakin's job to keep an eye on her . Along the way though , he breaks a Jedi rule by falling in love . Meanwhile , Obi-Won searches for the bounty hunter , and finds a planet where cloning of troops is taking place , apparently for the Rebels . Anakin feels very strongly about his mother , Shmi Skywalker-Lars ( Pernilla August ) , so he takes Padmé with him to his home planet to find her , and he manages to find her , in dying moments , so he kills the desert people that kidnapped her ( a step towards the Dark Side ) . Obi-Won is also on the planet , and he meets former Jedi , turned to Dark Side , Count Dooku / Darth Tyranus ( Christopher Lee ) , and the battle soon after gets under way , as the clones ( on the good side ) attack the villains . In the end , the war is over for now , Anakin gets a replacement hand ( that he lost ) , and he and Padmé marry . Also starring Samuel L . Jackson as Mace Windu , The Muppets ' Frank Oz ( aka Miss Piggy and Fozzie Bear ) as Yoda ( now computer generated ) , Ian McDiarmid as Supreme Chancellor Palpatine and Ahmed Best as Jar Jar Binks . This along with the other two are never going to be as good for story , dialogue ( which is ridiculous ) or ' magic ' as the originals , but the special effects are never disappointing . Star Wars was number 24 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons , and the film was number 65 on The Ultimate Film . Good !
572016	4248714	443489	6.0	Dreamgirls	I can agree with the critics ( giving it three stars out of five ) the story seems similar to Diana Ross and the Supremes , and one or two songs slow the action , but it is still a fantastic film , based on the hit Broadway musical , from director Bill Condon ( director of Gods and Monster , and scriptwriter of Chicago ) . Basically Deena Jones ( Golden Globe nominated pop singer Beyoncé Knowles ) , Lorrell Robinson ( Anika Noni Rose ) and lead singer Effie White ( introducing Oscar , BAFTA and Golden Globe winning American Idol contestant Jennifer Hudson ) are the African American R & B group , the Dreamettes , and after losing a talent contest , they meet ambitious Cadillac dealer Curtis Taylor Jr . ( Jamie Foxx ) who plans to break into the music industry , and as their manager he sets up tours to sing backup for R & B star James " Thunder " Early ( Golden Globe winning , and Oscar nominated Eddie Murphy ) , after striking a deal with Jimmy's manager , Marty Madison ( Danny Glover ) . Eventually , Curtis gives them the chance to be a real band , only if Deena is made lead singer , this is when Effie feels betrayed by her boyfriend . She goes along with it for a while , and The Dreams ( renamed ) become top-selling , but eventually Effie leaves when she knows Curtis has affections for Deena . Eight years later , Effie is depressed and looking after her daughter ( Curtis's ) Magic ( Mariah I . Wilson ) , meanwhile Deena ( now married to Curtis ) & the Dreams , with new backing singer Michelle Morris ( Sharon Leal ) are still popular , along with Curti's Rainbow Records company , running many other pop acts . Jimmy Early's star is fading though , and he turns to drugs , and he eventually dies of overdose . Not long after , Effie gets a comeback single , but this does not help Curtis's success going towards meltdown , and the Dreams breaking up . The conclusion sees Deena and the girls giving a farewell performance , along with Effie being lead singer for the slower version of " Dreamgirls " , and it ends with Curtis realising he is a Dad . Also starring Keith Robinson as C . C . White and John Lithgow as Jerry Harris . The singing and performances from the stars are incredible , especially from Hudson , the R & B , ballad and blues songs are magnificent , the dancing is well choreographed , the costumes are lavish and the editing is like a great music video , I love it ! It won the Oscar for Best Sound Mixing , and it was nominated for Best Art Direction , Best Costume Design , Best Song for Beyoncé's " Listen " ( also nominated the Golden Globe ) , Best Song for " Love You I Do " and Best Song for " Patience " , it was nominated the BAFTA for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music for Henry Krieger , and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy . Eddie Murphy was number 67 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars , and Beyoncé Knowles was number 4 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols . Good !
572722	4248714	117060	6.0	Mission : Impossible	I have seen one or two pretty good roles by Tom Cruise , and I suppose this could be one of them . This is a film with some action , some hacking , some intelligence and directed pretty well from director Brian De Palma ( Scarface , The Untouchables ) . Basically Cruise is a secret agent working for an unknown agency , and they do lots of cool secret stuff to find stuff , and kind of stop the bad guys . Unfortunately , it looks like Ethan Hunt ( Cruise ) and his team were found out , and his group apart from him are dead . Now he is trying to get loads of contacts to help him find the truth , while at the same time help them , e . g . steal access codes in a list ( the best part ) . Also starring Jon Voight as Jim Phelps , Emmanuelle Béart as Claire Phelps , Jean Reno as Franz Krieger , Ving Rhames as Luther Stickell , Kristin Scott Thomas as Sarah Davies and Vanessa Redgrave as Max . Tom Cruise was number 32 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars , he was number 25 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols , and he was number 81 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons . Good !
572493	4248714	899026	6.0	Pete Burns's Cosmetic Surgery Nightmares	I was not a fan of him in Celebrity Big Brother because so rude and unpleasant at times , but this programme showed that he can be okay . Pete Burns hosted this documentary with a quarter of it about his own cosmetic surgery nightmares , and three others . The first quarter had the story of Pete trying to look like a woman , and the consequences of his surgery from his body not coping , e . g . his new lips leaked puss . The three guests he brought on , all women , had similar occurrences of surgery complications and incidences . One woman had problems with her new breasts when it started to puss ; one had problems with her tummy tuck when her chest suddenly had a hole in it ; but one of the most shocking ones was the woman who had a face lift , and she looked like she had some sort of skin eating disease around her mouth . I personally would not get any type of surgery , part from maybe a smaller ear and some moles , but apart from that , I wouldn't do it unless it was really necessary or you are desperate to look better . Just remember the possible consequences of your actions . Good !
572592	4248714	94947	6.0	Dangerous Liaisons	An unusual film filled with fake passion and two very good deceivers doing something just a bit odd , from director Stephen Frears ( Mrs . Henderson Presents , The Queen ) . Oscar and BAFTA nominated Glenn Close plays Marquise Isabelle De Merteuil and John Malkovich plays Vicomte Sébastien De Valmont . These two for some reason like to deceive people into thinking that they love them , probably for the sex or to break up Close's family so they can be together . I can't remember many of Close's partners , but Malkovich " falls " for BAFTA winning , and Oscar nominated Michelle Pfeiffer as Madame Marie De Tourvel and Uma Thurman as Cécile De Volanges . Also starring Keanu Reeves as some gay like guy called Le Chevalier Raphael Danceny . An interesting idea , I just don't know why they enjoyed deceiving people to like / love them . It won the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration , Best Costume Design and Best Writing , Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium , and it was nominated for Best Music for George Fenton and Best Picture , and it won the BAFTA for Best Adapted Screenplay , and it was nominated for Best Cinematography , Best Costume Design , Best Direction for Stephen Frears ( Mrs . Henderson Presents , The Queen ) , Best Editing , Best Make Up Artist , Best Original Film Score and Best Production Design . Uma Thurman was number 95 , and John Malkovich was number 59 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars , and Malkovich was number 53 , and Thurman number 15 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols , and the film was number 30 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments . Good !
572349	4248714	253200	6.0	Last Orders	From Fred Schepisi , director of Roxanne and Fierce Creatures , this is quite a good drama . Basically it is all about the friends of Jack Dodds who have been given the difficult " last orders " of scattering his ashes to the sea . These friends , Vic Tucker ( Tom Courtenay ) , Lenny ' Len ' ( David Hemmings ) , Ray ' Raysie ' Johnson ( Bob Hoskins ) and ( I think ) Vince ' Vincey ' Dodds ( Ray Winstone ) on the journey remember the good times with their friend as butcher and pub mate . Sir Michael Caine as Jack in the flashbacks is the nice guy with a good personality . I cannot remember much of what happens , besides the scattering , and the fact that Caine and Hoskins are in it , but it is definitely worth seeing . Also starring Dame Helen Mirren as Amy Dodds . Good !
572890	4248714	372784	7.0	Batman Begins	The first of the Batman films directed by Tim Burton is just the best one . Why did Memento and Insomnia director Chrsitopher Nolan have to start the whole story from scratch ? He shows a new version of Wayne's parents murder , and how he became the Caped Crusader . Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne and Batman is very good for being mysterious and rough in places . He is also very good at being suave and posh . The villains in this one are Liam Neeson as Ducard , he works for Ra's Al Ghul , unless he is him . There is also Cillian Murphy as the terrifying Scarecrow , Dr . Jonathan Crane . Also starring Michael Caine as Alfred , Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes , Gary Oldman as Jim Gordon and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox . It was nominated the Oscar for Best Cinematography , and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Special Visual Effects , Best Production Design and Best Sound . Batman was number 84 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons . Very good !
571425	4248714	442663	7.0	Derren Brown : Messiah	Derren Brown , the pretty renowned magician and psychological illusionist , and this is one of the quite ambitious one-off specials he made . He was fascinated by people having beliefs , that he decided to put his skills to the test and try to convince people , including " experts " in a field themselves , that he has got a gift . He travelled to America , posing as five characters meeting " experts " in the fields of Christian evangelism ( instant conversion ) , alien abduction , psychic powers , New Age theories and mediums ( people who contact the dead ) . He said he would admit he is fake if they asked any questions as to whether what he was doing is real , and he carried off all five " performances " , and none of the " experts " questioned or stopped him , they totally believed it , a couple even invited him for more exhibition , he declined all . Very good !
571163	4248714	118375	7.0	King of the Hill	This is another good example of a comedy sitcom-like cartoon ( still not as good as The Simpsons ) . Hank Hill is the weird father and husband . He lives with his wife Peggy , his son Bobby and the large dog . Throughout the show they have some pretty weird and wonderful " adventure " like happenings . For example , the dog starts to get an infection and Hank thinks he should have a doghouse outside so it doesn't infect the house . Instead Bobby decides to use the doghouse himself when the dog refuses to go outside . Hank is quite a good example of the weird or not too intelligent father and husband ( Homer Simpson's still better though ) . It won the Emmys for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for Pamela Adlon and Outstanding Animated Program ( For Programming One Hour or Less ) ( it was nominated this same award 4 times ) . It was number 41 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons . Very good !
571460	4248714	91859	7.0	Rita , Sue and Bob Too	I heard about this for having some strong sexual scenes , and my Mum liked the film , and it turned out to be quite a fun film that went just a bit too quickly . There is no real story apart from Rita ( Siobhan Finneran ) and Sue ( Michelle Holmes ) are two school girls having a sexual fling with a married man named Bob ( George Costigan ) . It started with Bob asking if they know anything about sex , being virgins , and then having sex with them one at a time . It continues through the film , many meetings in not very popular public places and having sex . There are obviously many arguments about who should go first , Sue being argumentative towards her mother ( Patti Nicholls ) and father ( Willie Ross ) , and Bob trying to end it to be with wife Michelle ( Lesley Sharp ) . But it is a good comedy drama with some good laughs and turns . It was number 57 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments . Very good !
572608	4248714	1139161	7.0	Autopsy : Emergency Room	I do remember about one or two years ago I saw another programme filmed in Germany , with an audience of body donors , where the ( German ) presenter basically cut up , opened and examined bodies to find answers to many questions posed in certain circumstances . This new series was paying attention to medical emergency , and Dr . Gunther Von Hughes , accompanied by A & E consultant John Heyworth ( technically a co-presenter ) , naked models Anna Tatarczyk and Dennis Lau , and Red Cross expert Emma Rand this set out to answer the questions and give you the information you would need in an emergency situation . All bodies on the programme were donated for medical research such as this , and the emergencies focused were no breathing , stabbing , blood loss , brain damage , and many more in the certain subjects . The taking apart of bodies can be disturbing , the naked models are slightly odd but useful , and all the experts give a very interesting explanation about all the subjects to bodily emergency , that is the main reason I think it is a good programme . Very good !
571677	4248714	280609	7.0	Dog Soldiers	For a British horror from debut director Neil Marshall , who followed with the good The Descent , this is a good horror film with a classic theme recreated . Basically a British Sqaud , led by Sgt . Harry G . Wells ( Sean Pertwee , son of Jon Pertwee , aka Worzel Gummidge ) are sent on a training in the woods of Scotland against Special Operations , ignoring childish " campfire " stories about the area . Soon though they stumble into a savage werewolf attack , and they are now in battle with these terrifying creatures . They seclude themselves in a farmhouse provided by Megan ( Emma Cleasby ) , and the terror continues as these man-sized werewolves try to get in , and tear everyone apart , or turn them into more of them . Also starring Kevin McKidd as Pvt . Cooper , Liam Cunningham as Capt . Ryan , Thomas Lockyer as Cpl . Bruce Campbell , Darren Morfitt as ' Spoon ' Witherspoon , Chris Robson as Pvt . Joe Kirkley and Leslie Simpson as Pvt . Terry Milburn . The performances are cool , the effects are very good for a low budget film , and it a very good thrill film combining light humour and great gruesome gore . Very good !
572029	4248714	270288	7.0	Confessions of a Dangerous Mind	This was the directing debut for actor George Clooney , and accompanied by writer Charlie Kaufman ( Being John Malkovich ) , this tells the true story of an entertainment host and creator , who was also a killer . Basically Chuck Barris ( The Green Mile's Sam Rockwell ) wanted to get into television as that was where the big bucks were , he managed it , and he soon established himself as a creator for new shows , first being The Dating Shown ( think Blind Date in the UK ) . One day he meets Jim Byrd ( Clooney ) who wants to recruit him for the CIA to become an operative , basically killing people that need to be , Chuck agrees and is the likable game show host and creator of influential US shows by day , and the assassin by night . The trips the winning couples of Dating Game get are covers to get Barris to the countries for his kills . Other shows Barris was responsible for were The Gong Show and The Newlywed Game . Also starring Drew Barrymore as Barris's girlfriend Penny , Julia Roberts as Patricia Watson , The Hitcher's Rutger Hauer as Keeler , Maggie Gyllenhaal as Debbie , Kristen Wilson as Loretta , Jennifer Hall as Georgia , Jim Lange , Jaye P . Morgan , Dick Clark , Brad Pitt as Bachelor Brad , Matt Damon as Bachelor Matt and the real Chuck Barris ( in present day ) . Even with the dark subject matter , this story still has room for comedy moments , Rockwell is pretty convincing , and the supporting cast is very good too , just a good biographical comedy drama . Very good !
572839	4248714	110428	7.0	The Madness of King George	Based on the play , this is quite a good period drama of a new king of England that has an almost unexplainable madness . I did fall asleep somewhere , probably when Sir Ian Holm was helping cure the king , but what I did see of this film , based in the time of The French Revolution was good . Basically George III ( BAFTA winning , and Oscar nominated Nigel Hawthorne ) has recently been crowned , and not long after starts a dementia , and becomes more alive and more politically marginalized . All are concerned , especially wife Queen Charlotte ( Oscar and BAFTA nominated Dame Helen Mirren ) , well , unless you count the stupid Prince of Wales ( Rupert Everett ) . The only person who may be able to help the king return to normal " what-what " is Dr . Willis ( BAFTA nominated Holm ) . Also starring Rupert Graves as Greville , Amanda Donohoe as Lady Pembroke , Green Wing's Julian Rhind-Tutt as Duke of York , Julian Wadham as Pitt , Jim Carter as Fox and Geoffrey Palmer as Warren . I can see why Blackadder picked on this period with Prince George in Blackadder the Third . It won the Oscar for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration , and it was nominated for Best Writing , Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium , and it won the BAFTAs for Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film and Best Makeup / Hair , and it was nominated for Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music for George Fenton , Best Cinematography , Best Costume Design , Best Editing , Best Production Design , Best Adapted Screenplay , Best Sound , David Lean Award for Direction for Nicholas Hytner and Best Film . Rupert Everett was number 39 on The 50 Greatest British Actors , Amanda Donohoe was number 38 , and Dame Helen Mirren number 7 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses , and Mirren was number 5 on Britain's Finest Actresses . Very good !
571841	4248714	380936	7.0	Out of Sight	When I was younger this used to be one of my most favourite shows on CITV ( Children's Integalactic Television ) just after I got home from school . I never missed one episode because it was one of the best ideas for a show ever . Who wouldn't want to be able to turn invisible with a magic green spray . This boy somehow invented his own invisibility spray when trying an experiment , and he also found that water was the way to remove invisibility . He and his best friend used this spray for all sorts of adventures . They scared a retiring puppet performer to go a birthday party , they made some scientists believe in ghosts , they stopped thieves from stealing stuff at the school , they stopped a boy from cheating on a test , and the main boy even had one episode where he couldn't turn visible ! Very good !
571172	4248714	175880	8.0	Magnolia	From writer / director Paul Thomas Anderson ( Boogie Nights ) this is a very interesting drama with several interrelated characters in search for happiness , forgiveness and meaning , all in 24 hours . Oh , by the way , the title I thought was about the flower or colour , but it is reference to both the LA Blvd and similar to the term Charles Font , about where things falling from the sky come from . Anyway , the stories ( all somehow connected ) include : Frank T . J . Mackey ( Golden Globe winning , and Oscar nominated Tom Cruise ) is the successful motivational speaker with giving the aggressive seminar on dating called " Seduce and Destroy " , and he eventually , with the help of male nurse Phil Parma ( Philip Seymour Hoffman ) finds his dying ( of cancer ) father , Earl Partridge ( Jason Robards ) . Linda Partridge ( Julianne Moore ) married Earl for the money , but is struggling to have a normal life , and is resorting to suicide . Officer Jim Kurring ( John C . Reilly ) receives complaints about noise from neighbours , leading to cocaine addicted Claudia Wilson Gator ( Melora Walters ) , who he wants a date with . Jimmy Gator ( Bruce Almighty's Philip Baker Hall ) is estranged from his daughter ( Claudia ) , and he has been hosting popular quiz show " What Do Kids Know ? " for over 30 years , but he can't go on with his condition , two weeks left to live . Stanley Spector ( Jeremy Blackman ) is the brightest of three kids reigning on the show . ' Quiz Kid ' Donnie Smith ( William H . Macy ) was once a contestant on the show , but has been down on his luck since being struck by lightning . Towards the end , all characters meet the scary fate of a night where , after raining cats and dogs ( LOL ) , it rains frogs ! ( It can happen ) Also starring Melinda Dillon as Rose Gator , Luis Guzman as Luis , Tomorrow Never Dies ' Ricky Jay as Burt Ramsey , Evolution's Orlando Jones as Worm , Spider-Man 2's Alfred Molina as Solomon Solomon , Henry Gibson as Thurston Howell , Jackie Brown's Michael Bowen as Rick Spector and Miriam Margolyes as Faye Barringer . It was nominated the Oscars for Best Song for " Save Me " ( also nominated the Golden Globe and Best Writing , Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen . Tom Cruise was number 32 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars , he was number 25 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols , and he was number 81 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons . Very good !
571798	4248714	100935	8.0	Wild at Heart	From director David Lynch , this film ( along with The Elephant Man and Blue Velvet ) makes more sense than many of his others , and is really good . It is all about Nicolas Cage as Sailor , the film pretty much starts with the explanation for the title , when he murders a black man . 20 or so years later he is released and is reunited with his true love , Lula ( Laura Dern ) . This film has quite a few flashbacks with both characters , and you kind of have to pay attention to them , but Lula's Mum character is one of the nastiest and most unusual stories of the film . In real life Cage is an Elvis fan , and the character having a real enthusiasm about him is really important to the story , especially at the very end . The ending is the best part , besides when Bobby Peru ( Willem Dafoe ) blows his head off , when he is beaten up by thugs he calls homosexuals , he waken up by The Wizard of Oz's good fairy , and he runs back to Lula , and he sings a fantastic version of Elvis's " Love Me Tender " , it was quite emotional . Also starring J . E . Freeman as Santos , Back to the Future's Crispin Glover as Dell , Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Diane Ladd as the horrible Marietta Fortune , Calvin Lockhart as Reggie , Isabella Rossellini as Perdita and Harry Dean Stanton as Johnnie Farragut . It was nominated the BAFTA for Best Sound . Nicolas Cage was number 33 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars . Very good !
571087	4248714	1101386	8.0	Movie Connections	There was Drama and Comedy Connections , and this new spin-off is the one I could not miss , at least for the films I really know and like . Narrated by Ugly Betty's Ashley Jensen , this programme every episode basically focused on one particular British film ; with cast , crew and critics interviews , clips of course , and other info ( e . g . awards , acclaim , box office success ) to help explain why the film is such a favourite with audiences . The films they have focused on have included : Four Weddings and a Funeral , Billy Elliot , Bend It Like Beckham ; Lock , Stock and Two Smoking Barrels , Shakespeare in Love , Brassed Off and Gregory's Girl . With contributions from : Hugh Grant , James Fleet , Simon Callow , David Haig , Sophie Thompson , Mike Newell , Richard Curtis , Jamie Bell , Gary Lewis , Julie Walters , Stephen Daldry , Parminder Nagra , Juliet Stevenson , Gurinder Chadha , Joseph Fiennes , Rupert Everett , John Madden , Marc Norman , Mark Herman and many more . Very good !
572986	4248714	78788	8.0	Apocalyse Now Redux	With eleven or whatever minutes of extra footage cut into the film , Apocalpyse Now Redux ( returned ) has its moments . Basically the whole film is based around Captain Benjamin L . Willard ( BAFTA nominated Martin Sheen ) travelling through Vietnam ( during the war ) and fighting all the enemies . However , Ben also has the mission of finding the sinister Colonel Walter E . Kurtz ( Marlon Brando ) . I think the two best moments of the film are the battle scene , and the quote that follows it , " I love the smell of Napalm in the morning " , which was number 12 on 100 Years , 100 Quotes . The first two hours are really cool , but it is after Ben meets Kurtz that I wonder what is going on . But still , this to most people is one of the greatest war films ever made , especially from BAFTA winning , and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated director Francis Ford Coppola ( The Godfather Trilogy ) . Also starring Oscar nominated , and BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Robert Duvall as Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore , Frederic Forrest as Jay ' Chef ' Hicks , Sam Bottoms as Lance B . Johnson , Laurence Fishburne as Tyrone ' Clean ' Miller , Albert Hall as Chief Phillips , Harrison Ford as Colonel Lucas and Dennis Hopper as Photojournalist . It won the Oscars for Best Cinematography and Best Sound , and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration , Best Film Editing , Best Writing , Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium and Best Picture , it was nominated the BAFTAs for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music for Carmine and Francis Ford Coppola , Best Cinematography , Best Editing , Best Production Design , Best Sound Track and Best Film , and it won the Golden Globe for Best Original Score , and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture - Drama . Dennis Hopper was number 80 , and Marlon Brando number 30 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars , Brando was also number 11 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols , he was number 4 on 100 Years , 100 Stars - Men , and Hopper was number 49 , and Brando number 1 on The World's Greatest Actor , the film was number 2 on The 100 Greatest War Films , it was number 1 on Film 4's 50 Films To See Before You Die , it was number 28 on 100 Years , 100 Movies , and it was number 13 on The 100 Greatest Films . Very good !
572564	4248714	74486	8.0	Eraserhead	Critics say this is a really disturbing film from director David Lynch ( Blue Velvet , Wild at Heart ) , and compare it to Un Chien Andalou , and I can agree with them in both cases . It is surreal , it is pretty unbearable , and it makes no sense ( with no plot ) . I don't know them , but this story is about Henry Spencer ( Jack Nance ) and Mary X ( Charlotte Stewart ) , and also with Allen Joseph as Mr . X and Jeanne Bates as Mrs . X . There is obviously some kind of romance with Henry and Mary , but there apart from that it is all really acclaimed nonsense . The moments that really stick out are Henry's ridiculous hair , the mini chickens at dinner filled with blood , a " fishy " looking alien baby that makes a horrible crying , and where the title is explained , when Henry's head shoots off with blood , a kid takes it , and some guy drills out brain to make pencil erasers . It is like a nightmare , but many people think it is a masterpiece , I guess I can agree . Very good !
571091	4248714	1118502	8.0	Channel 4 at 25	The 2nd of November 2007 marked the 25th anniversary of Channel 4 , and this documentary special was part of the celebration , showing the highlights , discussions , controversy and slants of this most talked about terrestrial television channel . Using footage and interviews of all people involved with ( including started on ) and the channel in all it's history , it reminisced from the first broadcast of Countdown and the continuing years of the channel's efforts , successions and mistakes of trying to become the most mainstream , influential and talked about channels on TV . Most of the great programmes I have watched over my years have come from this great channel , and some they talk about , show or mention , including : Big Brother , Father Ted , Bo ' Selecta ! , Green Wing , The Friday Night Project , Sacha Baron Cohen ( Ali G , Borat and Bruno ) programmes , Wife Swap , You Are What You Eat , Friends , My Name Is Earl , The Sopranos and many more , and also the films , Trainspotting , Shallow Grave and many others . Narrated by Julian Rhind-Tutt , and with contributions from Carol Vorderman , Keith Allen , Nadia Almada , Rory Bremner , Julian Clary , Ben Elton , Stephen Frears , Michael Grade , Jools Holland , Jeremy Isaacs , Michael Jackson ( a chief executive ) , Guy Jenkin , Neil Jordan , Robert Lindsay , Davina McCall , Jamie Oliver and Jon Snow . A very interesting documentary that I can really enjoy , watching past clips of some great shows , and seeing what sort of stuff they have done in the past that has made it one of the most talked about channels on TV , I hope it continues for years to come . Very good !
573139	4248714	206634	8.0	Children of Men	Based on the novel by P . D . James this is a pretty gritty vision of the future from director Alfonso Cuarón ( Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban ) . Basically , it is 2027 in England , and concerns of the nation are the rise in illegal immigrants and the infertility of women . The youngest person on Earth died , at 18 years old , and human life and its morals are almost becoming extinct . Theodore Faron ( Clive Owen ) finds an underground rebel band called The Fishes , and as he goes along with these people , one of which being ( for a little while ) Julian ( Julianne Moore ) , he finds the one thing that could change the course of humanity , the first pregnant woman is 18 years ! Now he , Kee ( Claire-Hope Ashitey ) and Miriam ( Matilda's Pam Ferris ) are on the run from the Human Project , so the baby ( after it's out ) is safe . Aging hippie Jasper ( Sir Michael Caine ) helps out for a while as well in the process of this important road trip . Also starring Love Actually's Chiwetel Ejiofor as Luke . The scenes when Owen is escaping gunfire in the wrecked streets is extraordinary when it doesn't cut for at least five minutes , even with red spots flicked on the camera . It was nominated the Oscars for Best Cinematography , Best Editing and Best Writing , Adapted Screenplay , and it won the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography and Best Production Design , and it was nominated for Best Special Visual Effects . Very good !
572094	4248714	29947	8.0	Bringing Up Baby	For it's time it was probably really good comedy . It is , but some of it is just a bit annoying and repetitive , especially the bit when they are in jail and trying to get the story straight . Katharine Hepburn plays Susan Vance , she one day meets Cary Grant asDr . David Huxley and they kind of get quite close . Susan is quite rich and she even owns a pet leopard named Baby , David is obviously not sure about her having her . Baby later escapes and David and Susan soon go everywhere to try and catch her before the circus do . Quite good screwball , situation like comedy . Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn are quite a good duo . It was number 51 on 100 Years , 100 Passions , it was number 97 on 100 Years , 100 Movies , and it was number 14 on 100 Years , 100 Laughs . Very good !
571040	4248714	280778	8.0	Iris	Based on a true story , this is a really good film about one woman's life with a hard to deal with problem that his husband has to live with . BAFTA winning , and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Dame Judi Dench plays Iris Murdoch , a famous writer who makes books , most about her private thoughts and problems made into a story or autobiography like book . Iris's husband John ( Oscar and Golden Globe winning , and BAFTA nominated Jim Broadbent ) is proud of her making these books , but there are moments when living with her he cannot deal with . She suffers Alzheimer's disease , and doesn't understand what is going on , and has panics for no reason . She also has flashbacks of her life with young John , where she is played by Oscar nominated Kate Winslet , with a couple of nude scenes thrown in . Also starring BAFTA nominated Hugh Bonneville as Young John Bayley and Shaun of the Dead's Penelope Wilton as Janet Stone . I thought Broadbent stole the show , particularly with his panics , happy times , but ultimately struggling to cope with Iris . It was nominated the BAFTA for the Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film and Best Adapted Screenplay . Kate Winslet was number 55 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars , Winslet was number 2 , and Dame Judi Dench number 1 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses , Dench was number 1 on Britain's Finest Actresses , and Winslet was number 29 , and Dench number 8 on The World's Greatest Actor , and Jim Broadbent was number 23 on The 50 Greatest British Actors . Very good !
572824	4248714	117500	8.0	The Rock	I have said to myself I have seen many times , but I obviously haven't . Basically the villains , lead by nasty Brigadier General Francis X . Hummel , USMC ( Ed Harris ) have stolen three warheads , filled with a lethal and wide spreading VX poison nerve gas , which destroys all internal organs , along with melting flesh , and he threatens to spread these all over San Francisco , and kill the many hostages in Alcatraz prison unless he gets a ransom . He has also taken a large number of hostages touring an old Alcatraz prison . FBI chemical / biological weapons expert Dr . Stanley Goodspeed ( Nicholas Cage ) is assigned to retrieve these warheads , along with the only man known to have escaped this prison and knows most of the underground tunnels , top-secret federal prisoner , John Patrick Mason ( Sir Sean Connery ) . At first he is pretty uncooperative , causing havoc in a high speed chase , but he eventually settles to help them to stop the terrorists . The rest of the action takes place under and above ground in the Alcatraz prison , with many soldiers from both sides shooting their many weapons . The one moment I have always remembered is the bit when Cage crashes his car , and some guy said " Dude , you just f up your Ferrari " , and he replies " It's not mine ! " Also starring John Spencer as FBI Director James Womack , David Morse as Major Tom Baxter , William Forsythe as Special Agent Ernest Paxton , Michael Biehn as Commander Anderson and Candyman's Tony Todd as Captain Darrow . It was nominated the Oscar for Best Sound . Nicolas Cage was number 33 , and Sir Sean Connery number 8 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars , Connery was also number 3 on The 50 Greatest British Actors . Very good !
571948	4248714	82766	8.0	Mommie Dearest	Based on the book by her vengeful adopted daughter , this is the true story of one of Hollywood's greatest actresses going to the bottom . Bonnie and Clyde's Faye Dunaway as Joan Crawford is the most misunderstood and dramatic characters since Alex Forrest or Annie Wilkes , and just as nasty . She is obviously a huge star , and she adopted a son and daughter to get bothy publicity and a family . It is just when she goes mad that she looks like an unfit and struggling mother , especially when her career seems to be failing . Diana Scarwid as Christina Crawford ( adult ) is great , and Mara Hobel as Christina ( child ) is also gripping . Also starring Steve Forrest as Greg Savitt , Howard Da Silva as Louis B . Mayer , Rutanya Alda as Carol Ann , Xander Berkeley as Christopher Crawford ( adult ) and Jeremy Scott Reinbolt as Christopher ( child ) . It is quite disturbing to see a Hollywood actress do the types of things she does to Christina . It was number 72 on 100 Years , 100 Quotes ( " No wire hanger , ever . " ) , and Joan Crawford ( the character ) was number 41 on 100 Years , 100 Heroes & Villains . Very good !
570926	4248714	117008	8.0	Matilda	This is probably one of the best examples of a book based film that I have ever seen , especially based on a Roald Dahl book . Director and star ( and narrator ) Danny DeVito has made Matilda a lovable little girl and based the whole film through the eyes of a child , an excellent idea . The Wormwoods are not very nice people , and they have given to a little girl . As a baby , and growing , this child seemed very clever , but they never noticed , they named her Matilda . Mara Wilson as Matilda is just perfect , and her parents , Harry ( DeVito ) and Zinnia Wormwood ( DeVito's real wife , Rhea Perlman ) are a really good mean mean couple . Matilda made many friends in school , including teacher Miss Jennifer ' Jenny ' Honey ( Embeth Davidtz ) . The only person she or no other kids could go near was the very good villain Miss Agatha Trunchbull ( Pam Ferris ) , who throws children for punishment ! A very good film about a wonderful girl and her magic powers , perfect family viewing . Very good !
571486	4248714	1033590	8.0	The Good Samaritan	If you like TV made drama films , like Goodnight Mister Tom , Heartless and The History of Mr . Polly , then you'll love this one with practically the same kind of character we came to love him as in EastEnders ( Alfie Moon ) . Shane Richie plays Brian Guest , the nice , cheeky and likable everyman with an ordinary life and office worker job . His life is changed though when one day he gets a call from Lewis Farrell ( Brendan Coyle ) asking for the Samaritans ( he dialled one number wrong ) , threatening suicide by jumping off Brian's office block , but he thinks it's a prank by a work mate . But when an accident has occurred at the block , Brian is convinced he sent Lewis to his death . He is now planning to compensate the family , mother and wife Hannah Farrell ( Julia Ford ) and her daughters , for their " loss " . But at the same time , he also has to deal with divorcing his wife , Lucy ( Louise Delamere ) . When giving the family money , he also falls for Hannah , and Lewis is not happy , and he gives Brian a piece of his mind at one of the daughters ' wedding ( that Brian's money paid for ) . It is like a classic episode of EastEnders where characters misunderstand , never get a word in , and have to face the giggly consequences . There is a happy ending for a while where Lucy leaves Brian alone , Lewis gets what he deserves , and Hannah and Brian are happy , but Brian gets another phone call from another suicidal man . Very good !
572550	4248714	118571	9.0	Air Force One	If you like great action thrillers , then you'll enjoy this film from director Wolfgang Petersen ( In the Line of Fire ) . Basically the President of the United States , James Marshall ( Harrison Ford ) is heading home after making a speech in Moscow on his famous plane , Air Force One . But on the journey , the plane is hijacked by Russian terrorists , led by Ivan Korshunov ( Gary Oldman ) . The President supposedly got in the escape pod before they could get to him , but he didn't , he has stayed on , got a gun ( he has experience of battle ) and is trying to communicate to the authorities , land the plane and save his wife Grace ( Wendy Crewson ) and daughter Alice ( Liesel Matthews ) . Oh , I should mention that the guns shooting is okay , because the plane is able to withstand that sort of attack ( from the inside anyway ) . The Vice President Kathryn Bennett ( Glenn Close ) on the ground is trying to renegotiate with the terrorists ' demands to release convicted General Ivan Radek ( Jurgen Prochnow ) , but they will shoot a hostage every half hour they take to get it done . Eventually Korshunov is aware the President is still on the plane , and the one causing them problems , e . g . fuel loss and outside attacks , but Marshall manages to save the day getting many hostages off , killing those that deserve it , and getting out alive before the plane crashes . Also starring Paul Guilfoyle as Chief of Staff Lloyd ' Shep ' Shepherd , Terminator 2's Xander Berkeley as Secret Service Agent Gibbs , William H . Macy as Major Caldwell , Dean Stockwell as Defense Secretary Walter Dean , Andrew Divoff as Boris Bazylev and Bruce Almighty's Philip Baker Hall as U . S . Atty . General Andrew Ward . This is probably one of the only films where the U . S . President kicks ass instead of someone else doing it for him , e . g . bodyguard , FBI agent . It was nominated the Oscars for Best Film Editing and Best Sound . Gary Oldman was number 40 , and Harrison Ford number 5 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars , Oldman was also number 11 on The 50 Greatest British Actors , and he was number 36 on The World's Greatest Actor . Very good !
571490	4248714	361227	9.0	Punk'd	In Britain , we have Beadle's About and Ant & Dec Undercover , in America , they have this very good programme with the same type of concept , only a bit bigger and braver . Ashton Kutcher and a gang of jokers basically choose a well-known person , celebrity , at random ( I guess ) , find where they are going , and try to fool them into making themselves look an idiot or really cross . The celebrities they have managed to fool , aka get Punk'd , include Christina Aguilera , Pamela Anderson , Pierce Brosnan , Ray Liotta , Denise Richards , Justin Timberlake , Tom Arnold , Billy Boyd , Dominic Monaghan , Brittany Murphy , Kelly Osbourne , Sharon Osbourne , Seth Green , Jessica Simpson , Jack Osbourne , Pink , Britney Spears , Missy Elliott , Tommy Lee , Katie Holmes , Ashanti , Halle Berry , Penélope Cruz , Robert Downey Jr . , Rose McGowan , Jaime Pressly , Alicia Silverstone , Beyoncé Knowles , Matthew Perry , Chris Klein , The Rock , Carmen Electra , Tara Reid , Shannon Elizabeth , Kanye West , Salma Hayek , Kirsten Dunst , Joss Stone , Simon Cowell , Randy Jackson , Tony Hawk , Thora Birch , Akon , Adrien Brody , Mischa Barton , Bam Margera , Neve Campbell , Serena and Venus Williams , Kate Beckinsale , Elijah Wood , Hugh Jackman , Brett Ratner , Rihanna and many more . Sometimes you wonder how they got away with doing some of the stunts , as some are bigger than others , but it is hilarious when they do . As far as I know , it was on The 100 Greatest Funny Moments . Very good !
572556	4248714	281736	9.0	Comic Relief Presents Have I Got Buzzcocks All Over	This show was part of the long line up of entertainment on Comic Relief 2001 , I didn't actually see the show but I saw this on the Highlights show . This was basically taking three comedy tabloid like shows and bringing them together . These shows are Have I Got News For You , Never Mind the Buzzcock's and They Think It's All Over . Angus Deayton hosted this really good show . Taking part in answering the many rounds ( shown in highlights ) ( that I know ) were Stephen Fry and Never Mind the Buzzcocks ' Phil Jupitus . There were rounds like : odd one out , four with something in common ( but one ) , a clip of The World Bowls Championship and feel the person challenge . This was just a very good highlight of Comic Relief 2001 . Very good !
573288	4248714	66279	9.0	The Railway Children	I will admit I possibly missed tiny moments when I wasn't paying proper attention , but I got enough of the story to agree that it is a great family film , from director Lionel Jefferies , who played Grandpa Potts in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang . Basically it starts with a happy upper-middle class family living in Victorian London . One night the Father ( Iain Cuthbertson ) is visited by two strangers , and he leaves with them , and does not return . They move to a cottage in the country , and here the children ; Bobbie ( Jenny Agutter , who I first saw in Child's Play 2 ) , Phyllis ( Sally Thomsett ) and Peter ( Gary Warren ) keep their spirits up , with their fascination for the nearby railroad . Everyday they wave faithfully to the passengers in the passing trains , and with courage and vigilance they also avoid an accident and are made heroes . Their kindness makes them friends , including important people who can help find the mystery of their missing father . Also starring Dinah Sheridan as Mother / Mrs . Waterbury , Bernard Cribbins as Albert Perks , William Mervyn as Old Gentleman , Peter Bromilow as Doctor Forrest , Ann Lancaster as Ruth and Gordon Whiting as Russian . It was number 29 on The 100 Greatest Family Films . Very good !
573089	4248714	442655	9.0	The Big Fat Quiz of the Year 2004	If you knew your news , events , media and happenings of the year 2004 , then this was the show that you needed to watch . Hosted by Jimmy Carr this quiz gave viewers , and the celebrities the opportunity to test their knowledge of the past twelve months . This show had celebrity guests , in teams , they included : Rob Brydon , Jonathan Ross , June Sarpong , David Walliams and Simon Pegg .

A very good quiz show with some good humour , good guests , a good host and a good chance to relive the year past . Very good !
573104	4248714	1083512	9.0	The Simpsons : a Culture Show Special	Not long before the anticipated release of their movie , and after celebrating the 400th episode and 20 years , The Culture Show paid homage to the great success of The Simpsons with this special half-hour documentary about them . Hosted by Lauren Laverne ( who co-hosts Culture Show along with the great film critic Mark Kermode ) , this programme basically looked back from their first appearance on The Tracey Ullman Show in 1987 and episodes gone by to see why everyone loves this cartoon sitcom so much . This included the key and supporting characters , the jokes , the celebrity appearances , the writers , the mocking of everyday things , and much more , a great one-off documentary with plenty of clips , information and opinion to keep you interested . With contributions from creator Matt Groening , Ricky Gervais , Nick Park , Stephen Hawking , Phill Jupitus , Helen Fielding and Johnny Vegas . Very good !
572804	4248714	108796	9.0	Harry Enfield and Chums	I can't really remember seeing the normal show , but I saw the Yule Log Christmas Special which was brilliant . BAFTA nominated Harry Enfield is one of the greatest sketch show people I know , and along with Paul Whitehouse ( The Fast Show ) and BAFTA nominated Kathy Burke it is a really good show . I can't really say much about the show , so I'll say about the Christmas one . The characters that really stuck out for me were : Kevin and Perry the Teenagers ( I've seen them on special video , Kevin's Guide to Being a Teenager ) ; Frank and George ( who used to be in the Hula Hoops adverts ) ; The Rich Guy ( " I am considerably richer than you ! " ) ; Honest John ; Michael Paine and many other weird and wonderful people . One of the funniest sketches of the Christmas Special for me was the Telecocknies ( a spoof of Teletubbies ) . It was nominated the BAFTA for Best Light Entertainment ( Programme or Series ) . Kevin the Teenager was number 15 on The 100 Greatest TV Characters , Waynetta Slob was number 37 on The World's Greatest Comedy Characters , The Christmas Special was number 34 on The 100 Greatest Christmas Moments , and The Slobs - Brown Baby was number 11 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Sketches . Very good !
572803	4248714	299302	9.0	Friday Night with Jonathan Ross	When there's nothing else good on Friday nights , this is probably the best show to watch . It's basically like a comedy chat show with the popular critic , actor and chat show host , slightly wobbly mouthed twice BAFTA and British Comedy Award winning , and National Television Award nominated Jonathan Ross . Throughout the show he has had many wonderful and famous people on the show , not counting Four Poofs and a Piano singing as they enter . My favourite episode so far has still been the one with Chris Tarrant , Johnny Vegas and Jim Carrey . You know what Carrey's like , they basically sang a chosen song as loud as possible and wrecked the studio . And it was the last in the Series ! Ross adds both humour and seriousness to make this show a very good award winner . It has been on all 100 Greatest TV Treats programmes so far . It won the BAFTAs for the Lew Grade Award ( also nominated ) , it won the British Comedy Awards for Best Comedy Entertainment Programme , and it was nominated the National Television Awards for Most Popular Entertainment Programme ( three times ) . Very good !
571588	4248714	823696	9.0	Best Ever ' Spitting Image '	It started in 1984 and ended in 1996 , and is still remembered as one of the best impression and puppet shows on television . This programme reflected people's opinion of the programme , and the best moments from the best latex puppets . Hosting this programme were two new creations made especially , Ant & Dec ! This programme had contributions from the stars of the programme , Jon Culshaw ( also voicing Ant , with Phil Cornwell as Dec ) , Ian Hislop , Harry Enfield and Alistair McGowan . It also had contributions from fans , and people who were impersonated , including : John Lloyd , Lord Neil Kinnock , Edwina Currie , David Baddiel , Lord Roy Hattersley , Sir Trevor McDonald , Desmond Lynam , Paul Daniels , Barry Norman , David Steel , Louise Gold , Chris Eubank and Bob Geldof . If you weren't on Spitting Image , you were pretty much a nobody , and even the people who didn't want to be on there ( e . g . the fantastic Margaret Thatcher puppet ) were on it . Whatever people thought of it , and the dreadful Chicken Song , it still remains a legend on TV . Very good !
572521	4248714	827945	9.0	PokerFace	This was apparently the idea from the hosts themselves , and it is really good one . Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly host this this terrific game show that tests your knowledge , but also your ability to lie and con . It does not matter how many answers you get right , you can still be in with a chance of winning £50 , 000 . The contestants have the choice of whether to fold and take their winnings , or not , or they could stay and continue , or win nothing . The only reason they may fold is if another contestant has conned / pokerfaced them . The last two contestants in the game have the chance to win the big cash , but there is no telling if they will fold . The final of six shows the winning contestants have to gamble their £50 , 000 for a guaranteed £1 , 000 , 00 . If they don't fold and they are lowest in points , it would have all been for nothing . Ant and Dec were number 56 on The 100 Worst Britons ( why ? ) , and they were number 7 on TV's 50 Greatest Stars . Very good !
570963	4248714	195457	9.0	Family Fortunes	This used be , and when it's on , still is one of my favourite family game shows on TV . Not just because of the host or the unusual families , but because it's one of those shows where you can join in . For example if they gave a certain subject where you name something , I can think of many . Some examples : a Simpson's character , a green vegetable , a thing you do before you go to bed , many other things like that . Les Dennis used to be a really good host , he was both amusing and helpful . The new host , Andy Collins is pretty good as well . In the end , it usually turned out good , even if they didn't win the car or the ten grand , they always went home with a good amount of money . It returned in 2006 with Celebrity editions hosted by Vernon Kay . It was number 50 on ITV : 50 Greatest Shows . Very good !
572850	4248714	39628	9.0	Miracle on 34th Street	The remake starring Lord Sir Richard Attenborough , Mara Wilson and Elizabeth Perkins might be more well known , and fun for kids , but the original is more critically acclaimed , from Golden Globe winning , and Oscar nominated writer , and director George Seaton ( Airport ) . Basically the actor playing Santa for Macy's Department Store Thanksgiving Day parade is found drunk , so the special events director Doris Walker ( Maureen O'Hara ) persuades the bearded man who found him , Kris Kringle ( Oscar and Golden Globe winning Edmund Gwenn ) to take his place . He proves to be a sensation with the public , and is quickly recruited to work in the Macy's store , even claiming he is the real Santa Claus . What gives the store some good business is that they market the fact that Kris is telling customers where to find certain items , including at better prices , and he is really enlightening everyone spirits , including Doris's own daughter Susan ( young West Side Story's Natalie Wood ) , who she taught to reject any belief and fantasy . The incompetent psychologist Dr . Pierce ( James Seay ) , hired for Kris , originally saying he is harmless ( when they thought he might be crazy ) , makes him erupt in anger , ending up with Kris put into Bellevue , awaiting a trial to prove his sanity . His defender , Doris's friend Fred Gailey ( John Payne ) isn't just fighting for Kris's release , but unbelievably his sanity , by proving he is the real Santa Claus ! It is going to take a miracle for Kris to win , but thankfully they find something that clearly proves his identity , a mountain of letters addressed to " Santa Claus " , all given to Kris at Christmas , they win the case ! Oh , and Susan gets the present she wanted for Christmas , a new house . Also starring Gene Lockhart as Judge Henry X . Harper , Porter Hall as Granville Sawyer , William Frawley as Charlie Halloran , Jerome Cowan as Dist . Atty . Thomas Mara , Philip Tonge as Julian Shellhammer , Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory's Jack Albertson as Post Office Mail Sorter , Harry Antrim as Mr . R . H . Macy and Rear Window's Thelma Ritter as Peter's Mother . It is good that the remake didn't copy everything , including how they win the case , and the present that the daughter wanted , because boy did Wilson want something big ! A perfect actor playing Kris , or Santa , and obviously the signature role of his career , he deserved the Oscar for playing one of the most well known characters in the world , a very enjoyable family film . It was nominated the Oscar for Best Picture . It was number 43 on The 100 Greatest Family Films , and it was number 9 on 100 Years , 100 Cheers . Very good !
572673	4248714	91763	9.0	Platoon	Based on his own experiences in it , Oscar , BAFTA and Golden Globe winning director / writer Oliver Stone decided that he should create a representation of the war in Vietnam from what he can remember of it , obviously mixed with a story . Basically Charlie Sheen as Pvt . Chris Taylor helps lead a team of soldiers into the country to fight against all the enemies that they can find . They suffer losing men , trying to help them , arguing about stuff , e . g . betrayal , and much more incidences . Sheen looks exactly like his Dad ( Martin , who was in the Vietnam film Apocalypse Now ) and he is the best in the film . Accompanying him are Golden Globe winning , and Oscar nominated Tom Berenger as Sgt . Bob Barnes , Oscar nominated Willem Dafoe as Sgt . Elias Grodin , Forest Whitaker as Big Harold , young Johnny Depp in his third film as Pvt . Gator Lerner and Candyman's Tony Todd as Sgt . Warren .

572185	4248714	875057	9.0	Bo ! in the US	It did have exactly the same buzz or humour as the original show , but it was still a good show .

572694	4248714	88011	10.0	Romancing the Stone	From director Robert Zemeckis , this is a fantastic adventure with a great jungle treasure hunt and some great tongue-in-cheek gags along the way . Basically Joan Wilder ( Kathleen Turner ) is a romance novelist , and one day receives a treasure map from his recently murdered brother-in-law , she also finds out her sister Elaine ( Mary Ellen Trainor ) and taken to Colombia , and the villains she go there to exchange the map for her sister . She gets there alright , but she finds herself stranded in the jungles , but she finds help with soldier-of-fortune Jack T .

Also starring Alfonso Arau as Juan , Manuel Ojeda as Zolo , Holland Taylor as Gloria , Eve Smith as Mrs . Irwin , Joe Nesnow as Super and José Chávez as Santos .

571565	4248714	43265	10.0	The African Queen	This is dominated by the two main stars on the boat , but it does not need any other characters as they are so gripping and so brilliant to watch together . Oscar winning , and BAFTA nominated Humphrey Bogart as Charlie Allnut and Oscar nominated Katharine Hepburn as Rose Sayer are just spectacular together as they travel down an African river to destroy a war vessel , the Louisa , planning to attack England or something . Charlie knows a way to make torpedoes from oxygen and timers , and Rose knows where the boat is going . Along the way the encounter rapids , bugs , storms , the Louisa and of course , each other ( both in the good and bad way ) . In the end they do find the Louisa , but are sentenced to hanging . Before they die they request marriage , and there good misfortune , they crash into the wrecked African Queen ( their boat ) and the torpedoes . One of the best film endings ever when they blow up the Louisa and swim away together . Also starring Robert Morley as Rev . Samuel Sayer and Peter Bull as Captain of Louisa .

572055	4248714	78748	10.0	Alien	Director Sir Ridley Scott here creates one of the best science-fiction films ever made , with some horror , action and thriller moments thrown in . Basically , the commercial towing vehicle , Nostromo , is heading back to Earth , when they receive an SOS signal from a nearby planet , and they are under obligation to investigate . They have a bad landing , but three of the crew members , Dallas ( Tom Skeritt ) , Lambert ( Veronica Cartwright ) and Kane ( BAFTA nominated John Hurt ) leave the ship to investigate . There they discover a hive colony of unknown creatures , the computer message was not an SOS , it was a warning . One of the eggs is disturbed , and a parasite ( face hugger ) attacks and attaches itself to Kane's face . Dallas and Ash ( Sir Ian Holm ) do try to get it off , but it's defense mechanism of acid for blood and the possibility of killing Kane ( because it is feeding him oxygen ) stops them . Soon though , he seems fine and this creature has detached and died . The pinnacle scene is where all the crew have dinner , and Kane starts coughing and struggling in pain , till his stomach suddenly gushes blood , and the alien ( or Xenomorph ) is born ( looking pretty phallic ) . It grows very quickly , and Brett ( Harry Dean Stanton ) is first to be attacked by the big , double-mouthed , acid dribbling alien . The crew plan to kill the creature and escape in the shuttle , and one by one die trying to find it . Ash also grossly reveals himself to be a android with the " special order " to bring this alien to Earth for scientific discovery . Eventually the other crew members , Lambert and Parker ( Yaphet Kotto ) are killed , till the commanding officer , Ripley ( BAFTA nominated Sigoureny Weaver ) ( who grew a bigger character as everyone else died ) is the lone survivor , along with cat Jones , and sets the Nostromo to self destruct and escapes in the shuttle . The alien was not destroyed though , but eventually she gets it out of the blast door , sucked into outer space , and blasted by the shuttle rockets . She concludes by making a report of the situation , with hope she will be picked up by the company , and she and Jones go into the pod for hibernation . I have also seen the 2003 Director's Cut version , but the only real major change is seeing Dallas cocooned , and a few chats , and many interesting scenes and moments cut out , I think the original version is much more interesting and essential . It won the Oscar for Best Visual Effects , and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration , it won the BAFTAs for Best Production Design and Best Sound Track , and it was nominated for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music for Jerry Goldsmith , Best Costume Design and Best Editing , and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score . Sigourney Weaver was number 20 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars , John Hurt was number 27 on The 100 Greatest British Actors , Ellen Ripley was number 8 ( Hero ) and The Alien number 14 ( Villain ) on 100 Years , 100 Heroes and Villains , the film was number 6 on 100 Years , 100 Thrills , it was number 4 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments , it was number 11 on Film 4's 50 Films To See Before You Die , and it was number 36 on The 100 Greatest Films . Outstanding !
571830	4248714	462233	10.0	Comic Relief Does University Challenge	This was part of the long night of entertainment for Comic Relief 2003 , but I have only seen highlights of it . Angus Deayton hosted the special celebrity edition of University Challenge . The guests that appeared in this show were Clive Anderson , David Baddiel , Danny Baker , Jeremy Beadle , Stephen Fry , Frank Skinner , Johnny Vaughn and Gina Yashere . Basically they just played it like University Challenge , except they added comedy humour to it , since it was Comic Relief . I remember that it was Danny Baker's team that won , I would have thought it would have been Stephen Fry . Outstanding comedy entertainment as part of Comic Relief 2003 !

572465	4248714	824747	10.0	Changeling	The dictionary defines " changeling " as a child surreptitiously or unintentionally substituted for another , a clever title for this drama film from BAFTA nominated director Clint Eastwood .

She also gets confirmation from two people who know him well , his dentist and school teacher , but Capt . J . J . Jones ( Jeffrey Donovan ) thinks Christine is going crazy with her accusations of the police being wrong , they go to extreme lengths to protect their reputation , they place her in a mental hospital under " Code 12 " ( attacking police reputation ) .

In one of the last scenes , Christine sees one of the young boys who escaped Northcott with the police , and he knew Walter , as he was the one who helped him escape , but he never knew where he went , it says in the end text that Christine never stopped searching for Walter . Also starring Colm Feore as Chief James E . Davis , Amy Ryan as Carol Dexter , Michael Kelly as Detective Lester Ybarra , Devon Conti as Arthur Hutchins and Eddie Alderson as Sanford Clark .

572054	4248714	90605	10.0	Aliens	Director James Cameron ( Terminators 1 + 2 , Titanic ) brought the superlative sequel to Sir Ridley Scott's science-fiction action horror thriller seven years later , and in terms of spectacle , this is much more elaborate . Basically , Ripley ( Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Sigourney Weaver ) is finally picked up by her company , 57 years later , which shocks her , she also has many nightmares of her past experience . But she soon agrees with Carter Burke ( Paul Reiser ) who asks her to be an adviser ( " that's all " ) when a team of heavily armed soldiers are going to the unknown planet ( LV-426 ) Ripley and the Nostromo landed on , which has over the years she has been in hibernation , been colonised ( i . e . made breathable atmosphere and buildings made ) . Their mission seems to be to destroy the aliens ( or Xenomorph ) after contact with the planet is lost , but Ripley is eventually dragged into the action as more and more of the soldiers are being killed . Along the way , they finds a survivor , Rebecca ' Newt ' Jorden ( Carrie Henn ) , and not long after they are stranded on the planet , with no communication to the company , and no shuttle to escape . They do make sure that the doors are secure so the aliens , and parasites ( facehuggers ) cannot get in , while android Bishop ( Lance Henriksen ) tries to get a shuttle to pick them up . They do eventually get close to escape , but Ripley , looking for captured Newt does get to meet the mother alien , destroy her egg nest and sack , before escaping and the place being destroyed . There is one final encounter with the alien mother not long after landing to safety , where in the Exosuit " power-loader " , uttering the great line " Get away from her , you bitch ! " Eventually she gets rid of the alien mother by throwing her into the blast doors and forcing her into outer space ( just like the first one ) . In the end , injured Cpl . Dwayne Hicks ( The Terminator's Michael Biehn ) , ripped-up Bishop , Newt and Ripley are the last survivors , all put into pods for hibernation . Also starring Bill Paxton as Pvt . Hudson , William Hope as Lt . Gorman , Jenette Goldstein as Pvt . Vasquez , Al Matthews as Sgt . Apone , Mark Rolston as Pvt . Drake and Wishmaster's Ricco Ross as Pvt . Frost . The special effects are much more impressive , and the action more intense and gripping , a brilliant sequel . I have also seen the extended 2 and a half hour version , that director Cameron prefers , but the extra material is either unnecessary or ridiculous , e . g . Ripley's dead grandma daughter , and where Newt came from , the original version is much more interesting and essential . It won the Oscars for Best Sound Effects Editing and Best Visual Effects , and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration , Best Film Editing , Best Music for James Horner and Best Sound , and it won the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects , and it was nominated for Best Make Up Artist , Best Production Design and Best Sound . Sigourney Weaver was number 20 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars , and Ellen Ripley was number 8 on 100 Years , 100 Heroes & Villains . Outstanding !
