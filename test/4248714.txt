572681	4248714	277371	1.0	Not Another Teen Movie	The title says it all , I just don't whether it means " Oh no , not another teen movie " or that this really isn't another teen movie , but either sounds fine . This isn't really one of the best teen films I have ever seen , it hardly has any decent gags , it picks on other teen movies , e . g . American Pie , Road Trip , and it only has one or two recognisable faces . They obviously take the names of popular film characters , e . g . Oz turned into Ox , and place them into a really bizarre school . They even allow a foreign exchange student to wear no clothes ! The two faces I recognise in this are Melissa Joan Hart also known as Sabrina , The Teenage Witch , and Mr . T . Trust me , you wouldn't like it , apart from some nudity and disgusting behaviour , e . g . an old woman and teenage girl snogging ! Poor !
571231	4248714	113540	1.0	Kids	I don't remember much of this film , apart from that I found it one of the most awful and boring films ever . Also , I do not know any of the actors , apart from Jon Abrahams as Steven ; and I do remember a character called Casper , because they called him the " friendly ghost " . I did have to watch it in College class once , and I remembered the moment of the mother breast feeding . The moment I didn't remember though was probably the only interesting , funny and watchable of the whole film I remember , one of the kids dips a tampon in his drink , and he sucks the liquid out of it , as it isn't dripping . Anyway , I still have not changed my opinion of it , even after the brief viewing in College , and only the critics think it is good , I didn't . The director Larry Clark was nominated the Golden Palm at the Cannes Film Festival . Poor !
571946	4248714	245724	1.0	FART - The Movie	I can't remember all that happens in this film , but I do remember some okay bits . This film was probably the inspiration for the awful Thunderpants . Basically Artie Wilson was born with a farting problem , he just can't stop when he is nervous , or easily amused , or he can make it happen himself . Seth Walther as Artie , or ' Farty Artie " is quite funny I suppose . The only really good bit I can remember is him depressed and saying that he can pull his finger and fart , with small or big pulls . Also starring Kevin P . Farley as Kevin " Bear " Cutterback , Heather McComb as Emily Miller , Christine Steel as Andre'a Parker , John Farley as Scooter , Rance Howard as Grandpa Morton , Royce D . Applegate as Officer Clemmons , Leslie Easterbrook as Science Teacher , Chris Soldevilla as Donnie , Francine Sama as Noreen and E . T . ' s Dee Wallace-Stone as Sara the Bartender . Poor !
572743	4248714	155975	1.0	Psycho	If you want an example of a reason remakes to classic films shouldn't always be made , then this is the perfect , almost comedic example . Director Gus Van Sant ( To Die For , Good Will Hunting ) hoped to create a more modern version of Sir Alfred Hitchcock's most celebrated film , and it just doesn't work . It is almost completely word-for-word and scene-for-scene , with the big differences being it is more modern , in colour and well known actors . You know the story , Marion Crane ( Anne Heche ) steals cash , goes to the Bates Motel , meets and gets shaky with Norman Bates ( Dodgeball's Vince Vaughn ) , he murders her in the shower , he dumps her , the car and the cash in the swamp , detective Milton Arbogast ( William H . Macy ) investigates and gets murdered , Marion's sister Lila ( Julianne Moore ) and lover Samuel ' Sam ' Loomis ( The Lord of the Rings ' Viggo Mortensen ) go to the motel , and you find out the mother is dead , and Bates is mother . Also starring Robert Forster as Dr . Fred Simon , Bruce Almighty's Philip Baker Hall as Sheriff Al Chambers , Liar Liar's Anne Haney as Mrs . Eliza Chambers , Roy Brocksmith as Man in Cowboy Hat outside Realty Office ( who was Hitchcock ) and Gus Van Sant as Man Talking to Man in Cowboy Hat . I can think of many reasons why this film is crap : crap acting , Norman Bates seems more kooky , almost camp , he even masturbates when looking through the peep hole ( unlike Anthony Perkins ) , stupid flash-frames during the murders , the shower scene , meant to be the best moment of the film , is the worst ( especially when instead of seeing the shower curtain torn off , you see Heche's ass ) , a less decomposed ( looks like The Mummy or something ) and just a weird remake . I can admit I liked how almost completely like the original it was in places , and it is quite good to see for a laugh , to see just how awful it is , but it is never going to be as good as Hitchcock's . Poor !
572851	4248714	205461	1.0	Thomas and the Magic Railroad	I used to love the TV series as a kid , I almost never missed it , so I decided to see this film both to see if there was any resemblance , and why the critics hate it , from director Britt Allcroft ( who created the show ) . Basically the supply of gold dust , for travel between Shining Time and the island of Sodor , is running out for Mr . Conductor ( Alec Baldwin ) . It doesn't help when Thomas the Tank Engine ( Edward Glen ) and friends are being attacked by the nasty Diesel 10 ( Neil Crone ) , who also wants to find the missing train Lady ( Allcroft ) and the Magic Railroad it runs on . Trying to help the situation are Mr . C's slacker cousin ( Michael E . Rodgers ) , new friend Lily ( slightly deeper voiced Mara Wilson ) , and her grandpa Burnett Stone ( Peter Fonda ) , who has lost his belief in the magic of Lady . That's about it . Also starring Cody McMains as Patch , Grease's Didi Conn as Stacy Jones , Crone as Gordon , Colm Feore as Toby , Linda Ballantyne as Percy , Kevin Frank as Bertie the Bus , Harold the Helicopter and Henry , Susan Roman as James and Shelley Skinner as Annie and Clarabel . No Fat Controller ! ? Maybe if Ringo Starr or Michael Angelis had returned to do all the characters voice , it could have improved it the tiniest bit . Then again , nothing can improve the ridiculous story , the stupid acting , the dreadful songs , and the feel that it is nothing like the TV series , even if it looks the same , it's just one of the worst TV adaptations ever . Very poor !
572772	4248714	79550	1.0	Meteor	This is a disaster movie from director Ronald Neame ( The Poseidon Adventure ) , but the real disaster is just how much this film sucks . Basically a comet / asteroid / meteor ( whatever you want to call it ) is heading for a collision for Earth , and obviously it could extinguish mankind if it hits . So the authorities want to combine the nuclear capabilities of both theirs and Russia's fire power to destroy the rock . People involved in the mission , in whatever way , are Dr . Paul Bradley ( Sir Sean Connery ) , Tatiana Nikolaevna Donskaya ( Natalie Wood ) , NASA's Harry Sherwood ( Karl Malden ) , Dr . Alexei Dubov ( Brian Keith ) and Maj . Gen . Adlon ( Martin Landau ) . Also starring Trevor Howard as Sir Michael Hughes , Richard Dysart as Secretary of Defense , Henry Fonda as the President and Roger Robinson as Hunter . What makes this film so awful is there is hardly any effort in the acting , well , they kept their faces straight . There's that ridiculous scene where everyone is getting covered in mud in the subway , and all the model rockets and the rock are not convincing enough , because you can tell their models , especially with the crappy explosions . Just one of the most terrible films I have ever seen . It was nominated the Oscar for Best Sound ( it shouldn't have been nominated for any ! ) . Very poor !
572887	4248714	87995	2.0	Repo Man	It apparently had bad reviews , I'm not surprised , I couldn't understand the significance of it , why the critics give it four stars ( out of five ) , and I dozed off somewhere in the middle . The story as far as I got is that punk Otto ( The Breakfast Club's Emilio Estevez ) quits his job , and starts working with Bud ( Harry Dean Stanton ) as a Repo Man ( repossession for cars that have not been paid for ) . That's about it . I knew there was some sci-fi element because of the alien car or whatever , and at the end Otto gets in it and flies round the city , but this still wasn't enough to impress me . To be honest , as far as I saw , I'm not really bothered that I fell asleep during it , and I have no plans to watch / try it again for any reason . Pretty poor !
571679	4248714	360486	2.0	Constantine	Based on a DC comic , a man battling with hell and all it earthly happenings , and starring The Matrix's Keanu Reeves and The Mummy's Rachel Weisz , what could be better . But this isn't a good film in my opinion ! It the most confusing film I have seen for ages . What I could understand was John Constantine ( Reeves ) is a man who has a special gift to see and fight against the powers of hell and the supernatural . The exorcism scene he does at the beginning is quite cool . Angela Dodson ( Weisz ) recently lost her twin sister Isabel who supposedly committed suicide , she doesn't believe it . But after all that lot I can't understand anything . Just a load of battles because of I don't know what , I suppose it's wise to listen to some of the dialogue . Adequate !
573111	4248714	431197	3.0	The Kingdom	To be honest , I think I lost track during this film , and only the stars kept me going , but bits of this film from director Peter Berg ( Welcome to the Jungle ) were okay . Basically a terrorist detonates a bomb on an American facility in the Middle East , or Riyadh , Saudi Arabia . FBI Special Agent Ronald Fleury ( Jamie Foxx ) assembles an elite team to investigate and find the mad bomber . They are unwelcome by the Saudi authorities though , but they find Colonel Faris Al Ghazi ( Ashraf Barhom ) who helps them get around without too many problems . Eventually they realise the location of the bomber , and fighting for their on lives , they and the many strangers won't stop until justice is found in " The Kingdom " . Also starring Chris Cooper as Grant Sykes , Catch Me If You Can's Jennifer Garner as Janet Mayes , Jason Bateman as Adam Leavitt , Ali Suliman as Sergeant Haytham , Jeremy Piven as Damon Schmidt , Danny Huston as Attorney General Gideon Young , Richard Jenkins as FBI Director James Grace and Titanic's Frances Fisher as Elaine Flowers . The only interesting moments for me are some explosions , some bits of the investigation , as I said the cast , and that's about it . Adequate !
571162	4248714	260628	3.0	Kipper	This is a good example of a kids show . To be honest I only watched the theme tune most of the time , I hardly watched the actual show . It is based on some children's books , that's all I knew before I saw it . It is about a dog and his friends , a dog and a pig who have many weird and wonderful adventures . They go on magical roller coasters , they wall paint , they lose a kite , they chat in the playground , Kipper loses his slipper and many other strange but good stories . The only thing that's a bit disturbing to get used to is the fact that the really good comedian Martin Clunes voices a children's icon , but never mind . Very good for kids !
573143	4248714	329737	3.0	It's a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie	I once saw a bit of this film , and was interested to see the full thing just to see why the critics give it two stars , the result being that I agree . Basically the film begins with Kermit the Frog ( Steve Whitmire ) telling all his Muppet chums that they have lost everything , and he ends sitting depressed ( and possibly thinking about suicide ) on the bench . Meanwhile , in another world ( Heaven ) angel Daniel ( David Arquette , who had already been in Muppets from Space ) visits the ' Boss ' ( Whoopi Goldberg , another reason I wanted to see the film ) to show that Kermit really needs help . In the flashbacks , it shows Kermit , Miss Piggy ( Eric Jacobson , not the original and better Frank Oz ) , Gonzo ( Dave Goelz ) , Fozzie Bear ( also Jacobson ) , Pepe the Prawn ( Bill Barretta ) and all the other Muppets have prepared a stage show for many people to see in the Christmas holiday , and it all seems to be going well . But the really mean Rachel Bitterman ( Joan Cusack ) is determined to either shut the show or the theatre down , and Kermit is doing everything possible to make sure that doesn't happen . Of course , Kermit fails the last time , and Bitterman tells him that they are finished , and she can officially take the theatre . This is where Daniel is sent as Kermit's guardian angel to try and help him , but Kermit is not in the mood , and eventually ends up saying " I wish I was never born " . Obviously , you can recognise the spoof of It's a Wonderful Life , with Kermit as the George Bailey , and Cusack as the Mr . Potter , and in the end , obviously Kermit realises how much he means to everyone , and goes back to find the theatre saved as historical landmark . Also starring Whitmire as Rizzo the Rat and Beaker ; Goelz as Dr . Bunsen Honeydew and Waldorf ; Barretta as Dr . Teeth , Rowlf the Dog and Swedish Chef ; Jacobson as Animal and Yoda ( the only character who sounds similar to Oz's version ) , William H . Macy as Glenn , Matthew Lillard as Luc Fromage , Carson Daly , Molly Shannon ; Scrubs ' Zach Braff , Sarah Chalke , Neil Flynn , John C . McGinley and Judy Reyes , Mel Brooks as Joe Snow ; Brian Henson as Scooter and Janice ; Jerry Nelson as Robin the Frog , Statler , Pops and Floyd Pepper , and Kevin Clash as Sam the Eagle . The most memorable moment for me is the stage spoof of Moulin Rouge , besides that and the well known faces in it , not fantastic . It was nominated the Emmy for Outstanding Music and Lyrics for the song " Everyone Matters " . The Muppets were number 47 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons . Adequate !
572713	4248714	182789	4.0	Bicentennial Man	If you like futuristic films with some good special effects , then you might like most of this one . Basically it is the not too distant future , and robots are the new thing of the 21st century and nearly every home has one . ' Sir ' Richard Martin ( Sam Neill ) buys his family one of these robots , it's , or his name is Andrew . After being activated he always does work and tasks for the family . But it turns out Andrew ( Robin Williams ) is unique , he is discovering more about the world he lives in , and develops human qualities , e . g . feelings and emotions . He asks to be free and then travels the world searching for more unique robots , and he eventually finds Galatea ( Kiersten Warren ) , living with robotics expert Rupert Burns ( Oliver Platt . With his help , Andrew becomes essentially a real human , and falls in love with the niece of " Little Miss " Amanda ( Matilda's Embeth Davidtz ) , Portia ( also Davidtz ) . He lives for 200 years before cutting himself off and become a real human being . From director Chris Columbus ( Home Alone , Mrs . Doubtfire ) it is pleasant to watch , but I can see what the critics mean about too much sentimentality , it is almost drenched in it . It was nominated the Oscar for Best Makeup . Okay !
571375	4248714	157583	4.0	Enigma	I was quite interested in the theme of this film , involving one of the biggest parts of World War II , and the actors in it , and the result wasn't too bad . Basically during this war many Nazi U-boats used Enigma Codes to send secret messages , possibly their plans and stuff , and Britain's code-breaking centre didn't have long to crack it . The authorities enlist the help of a brilliant young man , Thomas Jericho ( Dougray Scott ) , who is a genius in the field of puzzle solving , or whatever he normally does . With this code-breaking job , Tom also has the trouble of tracking down the woman he had quite a thing for , Claire ( Saffron Burrows ) , who has disappeared , and he suspects of being allied with the enemy . To help him with the mysteries , he recruits Claire's best friend , Hester Wallace ( Kate Winslet ) , and together they discover quite a few betrayals , more importantly from Wigram ( Jeremy Northam ) . Also starring Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau as " Puck " Pukowski , Tom Hollander as Logie , Donald Sumpter as Leveret , Matthew Macfadyen as Cave and Corin Redgrave as Admiral Trowbridge . You really need to pay attention to this film to understand what is going on , but what I did wasn't too bad . It was number 66 on The 100 Greatest War Films . Okay !
573043	4248714	55831	4.0	Carry On Cruising	I have to be completely honest in saying first that I fell asleep somewhere in the middle , so I cannot give a full opinion about the film until I see it in full . Basically The SS Happy Wanderer is ready to set sail , but Captain Wellington Crowther ( Sid James ) has only just found out that loads of staff members have been replaced at such short notice . New members include First Officer Leonard Marjoribanks ( Kenneth Williams ) , Doctor Arthur Binn ( Kenneth Connor , cook Wilfred Haines ( Lance Percival ) and barman Sam Turner ( Jimmy Thompson ) , so the Captain not only has to put up with their incompetence , but the passengers aboard turn out to have strange qualities too . Also starring Liz Fraser as Glad Trimble , Dilys Laye as Florence ' Flo ' Castle , Esma Cannon as Bridget Madderley , Ronnie Stevens as Drunk Passenger , Vincent Ball as Jenkins and Cyril Chamberlain as steward Tom Tree . That's pretty much all can say about the film until I see it again in full , but I will say it has only three regulars , all male , but where are Charles Hawtrey , Jim Dale , Hattie Jacques , Barbara Windsor and Joans Sims when you want them ? Okay !
573162	4248714	256380	5.0	Shallow Hal	From the Farrelly brothers ( Dumb and Dumber , There's Something About Mary ) comes another pretty good comedy romance about the real meaning of beauty , inside and out , and the meaning of what it's like to fall for one of them . Basically Hal Larson ( Jack Black ) is a guy who has a very shallow view of women , he always tries for the young attractive ones . Then one day he meets a doctor who gives him a special gift , to see the inner beauty of women . So guess what , he sees many beautiful women in his eyes , but to us they look like old women or just ugly . Then one day , he meets the girl of his dreams , the big outside but beautiful inside Rosemary Shanahan ( Gwyneth Paltrow ) . His best mate knows what he is in love with , but Hal doesn't . He lasts ages with his inner beauty queen , he even has sex with her . Eventually when he is back to normal , he still cares about his love , even if she is fat . A pretty nice story explaining that beauty isn't everything . Worth watching !
573219	4248714	61199	5.0	Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree	This was the very first adventure based on the famous children's books from Walt Disney animations , when I was younger this used to be very good . Winnie the Pooh , the bear with little brain , lives in the Hundred Acre Wood with many friends including , Rabbit , Eeyore , Kanga and Roo , Owl and Christopher Robin . No sign of Tigger or Piglet though . Anyway , in this Pooh runs out of honey and notices a honey tree . He is trying everything he can to get some honey from the tree . But he instead gets it from Rabbit and ends up stuck in his front door . Kids will obviously love this cartoon for the cute and cuddly Pooh bear , and a very good story . Winnie the Pooh was number 55 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons . Woeth watching !
572767	4248714	91209	5.0	The Hitcher	This is a road movie , a thriller , and sometimes scary as well . If you have ever stopped and given someone ( a hitcher / hitchhiker ) a ride , you might think twice about it after this film . Basically Jim Halsey ( C . Thomas Howell ) is driving minding his own business , when he stops to pick up a hitcher . This hitcher , John Ryder ( Rutger Hauer ) becomes a little bit hard to deal with , and soon enough he is threatening Jim . It's only when Jim chucks him out that he becomes more mean . Now the hitcher is stalking him until he pays for what he did to him , whether that means killing him or not . Also starring Jennifer Jason Leigh as Nash . Worth watching , in my opinion !
572367	4248714	21755	5.0	Come Clean	Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history , and deservedly so , so I am happy to see any of their films . Ollie and Mrs . Hardy ( Gertrude Astor ) are hoping for a quiet night alone , but Stan and Mrs . Laurel ( Linda Loredo ) come along spoiling this . To make the best of the evening , Ollie and Stan go out to buy some ice cream , only afterwards to spot Kate ( Mae Busch ) , wanted by the police , jumping into the river . She blackmails them to take her with them , or she'll tell people they tried to kill her . So near misses , amusing methods of disguising noise and a small chase or two follow as they try to hide Kate from their wives , until eventually the police show up . Ollie points Stan out to be responsible , not realising whoever finds her gets $1000 reward , and it ends with Stan going down the drain of the bath , or as Ollie says , " he's gone to the beach " . Filled with good slapstick and all classic comedy you want from a black and white film , it is an enjoyable silent film . Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were number 7 on The Comedians ' Comedian . Worth watching !
571095	4248714	338348	5.0	The Polar Express	I saw snippets of Final Fantasy : The Spirits Within , and of course , Beowulf , and thought the computer animation looked brilliantly realistic , and then I got the chance to see this one that I had heard about . This film from director Robert Zemeckis ( Back to the Future , Forrest Gump , Beowulf ) sees the introduction of a new form of CGI that transfers the live actions of actors into a digital format , this is called " Performance Capture " . Anyway , based on the storybook by Chris Van Allsburg , it sees the Hero Boy doubting the existence of Santa Claus , and Christmas Eve night a magical train suddenly appears in the middle of the street . The train's conductor ( Tom Hanks ) invites him on The Polar Express to the North Pole , and at the last minute , the boy jumps on . Many other boys and girls have got on the train hoping to see Santa Claus , who is going to give a special present to a child of his choice . The journey sees tickets almost being lost , blizzard , iced over tracks and many other complications . they eventually reach the North Pole , and after a little turn , Hero Boy , Hero Girl ( Nona Gaye ) , Know-It-All ( Eddie Deezen , I recognised his voice immediately , he plays Mandark from Dexter's Laboratory ) and Lonely Boy ( Peter Scolari ) get to the ceremony just in time , and Santa ( Hanks again ) obviously chooses Hero Boy , probably because of his doubt earlier . I don't understand why he asked Santa for a sleigh bell , but on the other hand I suppose it is to help him remember that Santa does exist . Hanks also plays the Hobo and Scrooge . The animation is immaculate in detail , it must have taken them ages to get it as perfect as it is , it is just a shame the story is really , really cheesy . It was nominated the Oscar for Best Song for " Believe " , which also won a Grammy and was nominated the Golden Globe , Best Sound Editing and Best Sound Mixing , and it was nominated the BAFTA Children's Award for Best Feature Film . Worth watching !
571993	4248714	365485	5.0	The Matador	I mainly knew of this film because the ex-James Bond actor played a bad guy , i . e . hit-man , with a moustache , I didn't really find out the premise or anything , I just tried it and hoped I'd like it . Basically constantly drinking , smoking and woman-chasing private-hire hit-man Julian Noble ( Golden Globe nominated Pierce Brosnan ) is is New Mexico , and so is optimist Danny Wright ( Greg Kinnear ) , who is having a run of bad luck , e . g . his only child died , he's lost his job , his wife Carolyn ' Bean ' Wright ( Hope Davis ) is losing faith , and tree fell through his kitchen . Both men meet each other in the local bar by chance , Julian is the best conversation because he is pretty rude . The next morning Julian wants to make it up to Danny , so he takes him to a bullfight , and it is there Julian tells him his profession , of course , Danny takes it as a joke at first , but he knows he's serious when Julian asks him to help with a job . The last we see of Danny in Mexico City is Julian endlessly knocking on his hotel door , then it skips months later , and Julian turns up on Danny's doorstep one night in Christmas time , and when Carolyn isn't in the room , Julian tells him he needs to do one more job , otherwise he is going to be killed . Danny ( who has grown a moustache I should mention ) does agree to help , Julian lose his cool again when he has the perfect shot , but Danny plucks him up , and after the job is successful ( it was the man who wanted Julian dead ) they head home , and the film ends with Danny and Carolyn beside the grave of the dead son ( for the anniversary of his death ) , and Julian walks away . Also starring Philip Baker Hall as Mr . Randy , Happiness's Dylan Baker as Lovell , Adam Scott as Phil Garrison , Portia Dawson as Genevive and William Raymond as Mr . Stick . It may not have made me laugh a lot , but it is a good black comedy drama with an odd friendship , and Brosnan is good at sending up his most famous role . Worth watching !
572469	4248714	810900	5.0	High School Musical 2	I had seen the previous TV made Disney film since I heard a lot about it , so I guess I had to see if the sequel measured up too , from director Kenny Ortega ( Hocus Pocus ) . Basically all the original characters are back and they are out of school for the summer , and Sharpay Evans ( Ashley Tisdale ) is still trying to get Troy Bolton ( Zac Efron ) to leave Gabriella Montez ( Vanessa Anne Hudgens ) for her . So she hires him to work at her country house for the holiday , little realising they would hire all the other Wild Cats too , and Sharpay wants them either fired , or want to quit , to get Troy to herself . Also a talent contest is coming soon , and Sharpay wants to get rid of the competition , and it seems that Troy may be leaning towards either being with her more , and turning into a bit of a jerk towards all the Wild Cats . Luckily all is resolved in the end , and Sharpay's brother Ryan ( Lucas Grabeel ) helps to choreograph a successful talent contest entry for Troy and eventually Gabriella to win with , oh and Sharpay shows she can be nice by giving the trophy to her brother . Also starring Corbin Bleu as Chad Danforth , Monique Coleman as Taylor McKessie , Chris Warren Jr . as Zeke Baylor , Olesya Rulin as Kelsi Nielsen and Bart Johnson as Jack Bolton . Filled with some not bad performances , likable songs , and that real family feel about it , this is another one you can't help but like . It was nominated the Emmys for Outstanding Children's Program and Outstanding Choreography for the routines : " What Time Is It ? " , " Fabulous " , " Work This Out " , " I Don't Dance " , " You Are the Music In Me " and " For One " . Worth watching !
572751	4248714	18083	5.0	From Soup to Nuts	Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history , and deservedly so , so I am happy to see any of their films . Basically newly rich Mrs . Culpepper ( A Chump at Oxford's Anita Garvin ) has planned a big dinner party , eager to make a good impression in high society , but her husband ( Tiny Sandford ) is less enthusiastic , as she has learn more society ways . Worse is to come as they have hired short notice waiters , Stan and Ollie of course , and they turn out to be clumsy and pretty inexperienced . Ollie gets his face into a big cream cake not once , but three times , and Stan serves the salad undressed , no , literally , this joke also appeared in A Chump at Oxford . Filled with good slapstick and all classic comedy you want from a black and white film , it is an enjoyable silent film . Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were number 7 on The Comedians ' Comedian . Worth watching !
572362	4248714	18106	5.0	Love ' Em and Weep	Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history , and deservedly so , so I am happy to see any of their films . Four years later , this film was remade by Laurel and Hardy into the Chickens Come Home , so it pretty much exactly the same storyline and most of the same comedy moments , only difference being that it's silent . So the old flame ( Mae Busch ) of married businessman Titus Tillsbury ( James Finlayson ) shows up blackmailing him , and his work friend Romaine Ricketts ( Laurel ) to keep her away from Mrs . Aggie Tillsbury ( Charlotte Mineau ) . Hardy only gets a supporting role as Judge Chigger , a guest at the dinner party . Filled with good slapstick and all classic comedy you want from a black and white film , it is an enjoyable silent film . Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were number 7 on The Comedians ' Comedian . Worth watching !
571308	4248714	443274	5.0	Vantage Point	When I saw the trailer and the clips on Jonathan Ross , I thought this was a film I could definitely enjoy , but I did wonder why it was only given two out of five stars , now I know . Basically you see the same scene about four-five times , the shooting of President Ashton ( William Hurt ) - although you find out later it is actually a lookalike , and the real President gets kidnapped - and you see it from the point of view , aka Vantage Point , of eight characters . First is TV producer Rex Brooks ( Sigourney Weaver ) who catches an important suspect on film , second agent Thomas Barnes ( Dennis Quaid ) who will spot this suspect , third is a man involved Javier ( Edgar Ramirez ) , fourth is tourist Howard Lewis ( Forest Whitaker ) who sees more than he realises on his video camera , and the last few minutes see a mix of all characters involved , and it turns out there is a traitor in Baren's partner Kent Taylor ( Lost's Matthew Fox ) and a blackmailing . Also starring Ayelet Zurer as Veronica , Saïd Taghmaoui as Suarez and Eduardo Noriega as Enrique . The way this film is put together in the same style as a Japanese film called Rashomon , although I personally have seen it done in Tarantino's Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown , and quite a clever style it is . Yes , it is a tiny bit annoying seeing the same scene four to five times , but the points of view add some good twists , the cast of well known actors makes for good viewing , and there are some explosions and a chase sequence to keep you interested , oh , and finding out who is involved in the shooting . Worth watching !
572822	4248714	213203	5.0	Rugrats in Paris : The Movie	This is film sequel to the first film based on the second longest running cartoon on TV ( longest running is obviously The Simpsons ) . Basically best talking baby friends Tommy ( Elizabeth Daily ) , Chuckie ( Christine Cavanaugh ) , twins Phil and Lil , and mean Angelica ( Cheryl Chase ) this time are going to Paris when Tommy's Dad , Stu , is summoned to the region's theme park , Reptarland , to work on his new invention . Along the way the kids see the blossoming romance between Chuckie's Dad , and secretary Kira Watanabe ( Julia Kato ) , who works for the horrible Coco LaBouche ( Susan Sarandon ) . Also starring Casem Kasem as the wedding DJ , Debbie Reynolds as Lulu Pickles , John Lithgow as Jean-Claude , Tim Curry as Sumo Swinger , Billy West as another Sumo Singer and Dan Castellaneta as Priest . Good for kids , and adults will like some of it too . Worth watching !
572553	4248714	289840	5.0	The Adventures of Mole	When I was a kid , I used to like this cartoon version of the famous Kenneth Grahame story about the river . This was just the first part of a three part bunch of stories . This is the order : The Adventures of Mole , Mole's Christmas and The Adventures of Mr . Toad . Anyway , you probably know the story . Mole's spring cleaning , then goes outside and discovers the river and meets Rat . Then later they meet Mr . Toad ( voiced by Hugh Laurie ) , and finally meet Mr . Badger after a frightful trip in the Wild Wood . This cartoon was pretty good at the time , but not as good as some other versions of the story . I suppose it is alright !
571575	4248714	87291	5.0	Frankenweenie	This is another quite confusing but near entertaining film written and directed by genius Tim Burton , however it does show he has a dark side to him . This is a really interesting but highly silly idea for a film , this is basically a kid version of Frankenstein . Young Victor Frankenstein ( The NeverEnding Story's Barret Oliver ) is a 10 year old boy living with his Mum Susan ( The Shining's Shelley Duvall ) and Dad Ben ( Home Alone's Daniel Stern ) . One day while playing with his dog Sparky , Victor sees his dog his by a truck . He one day in science class gets the idea of conducting electricity into his dead dog's body to bring him back . He digs it up , sews it up and put it outside to be hit by lightning . He starts off well , but when he gets outside everyone thinks he is a monster . It does have a near ending tear jerker , but it does end happily . But this is quite silly to watch , it does all the same stuff with the original Boris Karloff Frankenstein , except with a kid and his dog . But never the less , an interesting Tim Burton film . Worth watching !
572745	4248714	109279	5.0	Black Beauty	I had read the reviews for this story of one of the most famous fictional horses in literacy , and this film adaptation is the only one so far that has a decent star rating ( all others are two , this is three ) , from director Caroline Thompson ( scriptwriter of Edward Scissorhands ) . Anyway , basically Black Beauty ( voiced by Alan Cumming ) tells his own stories of all his mini adventures , being given to many different masters , making many friends , doing many services for them , and ultimately his " circle of life " over many years . His mini adventures include being born , learning to stand and run , his name given , given hooves , being sold to new masters , a fire , falling in love , becoming sick , riding people , and much more . Starring Sean Bean as Farmer Grey , Dragonheart's David Thewlis as Jerry Barker , Jim Carter as John Manly , Peter Davison as Squire Gordon , Alun Armstrong as Reuben Smith , John McEnery as Mr . York , Eleanor Bron as Lady Wexmire and Peter Cook as Lord Wexmire . Kids , especially young girls , will adore this film , and there is some interest for the older viewers as well in this heartwarming drama . Worth watching !
571356	4248714	52911	5.0	It's All Right Jack	There are the moments where I giggled a bit , but not all of the film is that funny in my opinion . I also don't understand the meaning of the title . But one thing I liked about the film was the pretty good performance by BAFTA winning Peter Sellers as Fred Kite and John Kennaway . He pretty much stole the show with his slight stupidity but at the same time his intellect . I don't remember seeing them in it , but there's also Lord Sir Richard Attenborough as Sidney De Vere Cox and Terry-Thomas as Major Hitchcock . One of the most giggly moments that I can remember is the part where someone is thrown on the ground and his finger are run over by a passing truck , I can't really remember any other good bits . It won the BAFTA for Best British Screenplay , and it was nominated for Most Promising Newcomer for Liz Fraser as Cynthia Kite . Peter Sellers was number 57 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars , he was number 22 on The 50 Greatest British Actors , he was number 7 on Britain's Finest Actors , and he was number 24 on The World's Greatest Actor , and the film was number 62 on The Ultimate Film . Worth watching , in my opinion ( the critics give it five stars ) !
572654	4248714	356236	5.0	Brilliant Creatures	When I was a bit younger I only watched this show occasionally , but when I did watch it some of the episodes were either interesting , cute , furry or gross . Presenters Stephen Mulhern ( from The Quick Trick Show ) and Gail McKenna showed us many weird and wonderful facts and topics about animals . For example , we saws Ligers , crabs the size of cars , swimming with dolphins , communicating with wolves , feeding great white sharks , racing snails ( with marked shells ) and many other interesting things . It was just one of those shows you only watch when you feel like it , but if you have young kids or you are an animal lover , you'll love this . Worth watching !
572652	4248714	293725	5.0	Butt-Ugly Martians	When I was a bit younger I used to think this was pretty good , my brothers used to love it , so basically I only watched because they watched it . It's about three aliens from the planet Mars who originally came to our planet to destroy us . They then befriend some kids and change their minds . So now instead of destroying the earth , they save it . With their special transformation powers they can battle other extra-terrestrial life that threatens the planet . When their not battling , their obviously chilling with their friends , usually in a pizza or ice cream restaurant . At the time , quite an amusing and interesting computer animated show . Worth watching !
572098	4248714	131325	5.0	Bowfinger	This isn't exactly one of the best films I've seen , it seems like an outside Hollywood film . Directed by The Muppets ' Fozzie Bear and Star Wars ' Yoda , Frank Oz , it tells the story of a director Bobby Bowfinger ( Steve Martin ) in need of a new film . He decides to make a film called Chubby Rain where aliens come in rain to take over Earth . Unfortunately , the actor he wants for the film , Kit Ramsey ( Eddie Murphy ) has said no . So they decide to film him without him knowing , plus , they get a really good lookalike called Jiff ( Murphy again ) . A silly story , kind of like Airplane ! stupidity . Also starring Heather Graham as Daisy , The Grinch's Christine Baranski as Carol , Jamie Kennedy as Dave , Adam Alexi-Malle as Afrim , Terence Stamp as Terry Stricter and Robert Downey Jr . as Jerry Renfro . Pretty good !
572447	4248714	496261	5.0	Coronation Street Pantomime	This is the programme that was quite essential for me at Christmas , especially because every year ITV do a pantomime of some kind . In this case , one the nation's favourite soap's ( and one of mine , as well as EastEnders ) has the well known character actors in a pantomime . Starring Helen Worth ( Gail Platt ) , Elizabeth Dawn ( Vera Duckworth ) , Maggie Jones ( Blanche Hunt ) , William Tarmey ( Jack Duckworth ) , Sally Whittaker ( Sally Webster ) , Malcolm Hebden ( Norris Cole ) , John Savident ( Fred Elliott ) , David Neilson ( Roy Cropper ) , Tina O'Brien ( Sarah Louise Platt ) , Jimmi Harkishin ( Dev Alahan ) , Andrew Whyment ( Kirk Sutherland ) , Ryan Thomas ( Jason Grimshaw ) , Shobna Gulati ( Sunita Alahan ) , Jennie McAlpine ( Fiz Brown ) , Sally Lindsay ( Shelley Unwin ) , Susie Blake ( Bev Unwin ) , Antony Cotton ( Sean Tully ) , Wendi Peters ( Cilla Brown ) , Brooke Vincent ( Sophie Webster ) , Thomas Craig ( Tommy Harris ) , Nikki Snderson ( Candice Stowe ) , Rupert Hill ( Jamie Baldwin ) , Samuel Aston ( Chesney Brown ) and Schmichael the dog . But the main stars were Bradley Walsh ( Danny Baldwin ) and Debra Stephenson ( Frankie Baldwin ) playing Cinderella characters , that's basically what the pantomime is , a street version of Cinderella with great colourful dresses / costumes and lovable TV actors / actresses . This probably part of number 68 on The 100 Greatest Christmas Moments , Celebrity Pantomimes . Worth watching !
571826	4248714	374102	5.0	Open Water	I had heard about this when it was out at the cinemas , someone said it was crap , and Jonathan Ross apparently loved it , either way I knew I had to give it a go . I was expecting a normal proper big budget film , but what I didn't know was that it was made with a low budget and inexpensive cameras , so it is like a documentary style , just like The Blair Witch Project . Based on true events , Susan ( Blanchard Ryan ) and Daniel ( Daniel Travis ) are a couple on holiday in the Caribbean , Bahamas . They decide to take the opportunity to go scuba diving in the coral reef , miles from anywhere , and everyone's head is counted at 20 , and the counter accidentally mistakes someone going out twice for two people or something , so they leave Susan and Daniel in the middle of the ocean . When they see the boat is nowhere in sight they do not panic , that is until a couple of sharks and unknown to them jelly fish start showing up and causing them to worry . The scenes of them in the water is mainly all ( probably mostly improvised ) chatting , bickering and one or two shouts and waves for help , until eventually Daniel dies from his sting ( i'm assuming ) and Susan commits suicide , and at the wrong time , the boatman realised he left them and a search team started . It may not have the same impact as Blair Witch or Jaws , but it is quite an interesting film to watch once in a while . Worth watching !
571919	4248714	385267	5.0	In Good Company	I recognised a few of the actors appearing , and I like comedy dramas , so I thought , why not , from director Paul Weitz ( American Pie ) . Basically middle aged Dan Foreman ( Dennis Quaid ) is head of ad sales for a major magazine , but he is to be demoted when he gets a new boss in the form of young ( half Dan's age ) business school hotshot Carter Duryea ( Spider-Man 3's Topher Grace ) , preaching corporate synergy . Dan knows he has to get used to his new boss , and changes to the company , including firing employees he hired . Also he and Carter are having troubles at home , Dan has two daughters , Alex ( Scarlett Johansson ) - 18 , and Jana ( Zena Grey ) - 16 , and he is shocked when his wife Ann ( Species ' Marg Helgenberger ) tells him she is pregnant , Carter meanwhile is being dumped by his wife of seven months as he gets his promotion . Dan and Carter's uneasy friendship gets even worse when Dan discovers Carter has been sleeping with his daughter Alex . In the end , Dan and the wife have another healthy baby girl , and Carter and Alex still talk once in a while . Also starring Mighty Joe Young's David Paymer as Morty Wexler , Philip Baker Hall as Eugene Kalb , Clark Gregg as Mark Steckle , Cruel Intentions ' Selma Blair as Kimberly , Frankie Faison as Corwin , American Pie's John Cho as Petey , and look out for an uncredited Malcolm McDowell as Teddy K - Globecom CEO . I can't remember laughing a lot , but the film is certainly good in the drama department , with good performances from Quaid , Grace and Johansson . Worth watching !
570933	4248714	117333	5.0	Phenomenon	I recognised this film from the poster and the leading actor , but I had no idea what to expect , from director Jon Turteltaub ( While You Were Sleeping ) . Basically on his birthday , George Malley ( John Travolta ) sees a strange light come down from the sky , and hit him . No-one else saw it , and over the next few days George develops newfound intelligence and telekinesis ( moving things with his mind ) , and he uses these abilities for the good of his community . Word gets around about , and he becomes known as a freak , and everyone wants to know what happened to the old car mechanic . Soon enough the government gets involved wanting to see and understand his abilities . The only people that don't want to do anything to him , and are still good friends are Lace Pennamin ( Pyrates ' Kyra Sedgwick ) , Nate Pope ( Forest Whitaker ) and Doc Brunder ( Robert Duvall ) . Also starring David Gallagher as Al Pennamin , Ashley Buccille as Glory Pennamin , Tony Genaro as Tito , Sean O'Bryan as Banes and Independence Day's Brent Spiner as Dr . Bob Niedorf . Besides the one or two fun to watch tricks Travolta can do , this film is no much of a phenomenon , but it's okay . Worth watching !
571806	4248714	120877	5.0	Vampires	I might have seen a few seconds of the beginning once , and I'm glad I watched the whole film , from director John Carpenter ( Halloween , Starman ) . Basically Jack Crow ( James Woods ) is a vampire slayer on the Vatican payroll , and accompanied by others , including Montoya ( Daniel Baldwin ) , he is obviously on the lookout for the vampires , but the only things that can kill them are stakes in the heart and sunlight , forget garlic , crosses / the crucifix and the bible , they don't help . The big threat of the film is mastermind vampire Valek ( Thomas Ian Griffith ) who needs a black cross or something to be able to walk in sunlight from then on . Also starring Sheryl Lee as Katrina , Maximilian Schell as Cardinal Alba , Tim Guinee as Father Adam Guiteau , Boone Junior as Catlin Mark and Gregory Sierra as Father Giovanni . The main reason to see this film form me , besides a good performance ( with little dialogue ) by Woods , is the gore , some good amounts . Worth watching !
573259	4248714	120910	5.0	Fantasia 2000	I saw the trailer for this film back when it was out in cinema ( also released in Imax format ) , and I enjoyed the 1940 original , so I thought I'd give it a go . There are four reasons why this film just isn't as thought out as the original . Firstly , they have to get celebrities , such as Steve Martin , Bette Midler , Quincy Jones , magicians Penn and Teller , James Earl Jones and Angela Lansbury , introducing the numbers before they start . Secondly , all the numbers have a variety of animation styles , and in the original they only stuck to one , the normal broad style . Thirdly , only three of the numbers matched the music and I enjoyed , these were the flamingo with the yo-yo , Donald Duck with Daisy in a Noah's Ark story , and the repeat of The Sorceror's Apprentice with Mickey Mouse - conducted by the late Leopold Stokowski ( that's just lousy ) . Fourth and finally , this film just seems like an excuse to show the animation Disney studios are capable of , whether drawing or CGI , we don't need to be reminded they do great animation , and if your going to do it , make sure it matches the music . I would certainly enjoy seeing the three numbers mentioned again , but the rest just doesn't work . Worth watching !
571256	4248714	252444	6.0	Rabbit-Proof Fence	This is a good drama about two ( well a third briefly as well ) who go on a tremendous and a nearly fatal journey across a country to reach their homes , based on a true story . Basically three black girls are taken away from their poor ( and to the orphanage unfit ) mother to the far , far away orphanage . They become used to it for a little while , but soon enough they plan and carry out their escape . They are now facing a long journey across the country to return home to their mother . Unfortunately along the way they do leave clues , the biggest one being that they are using the road nearest to the Rabbit-Proof Fence , hence the title . The orphanage do catch one of the girls , but the others get away and make it to their home . I did not know anyone in this ( although that doesn't matter ) , except of course scene stealing Kenneth Branagh as A . O . Neville . Branagh was number 25 on The 50 Greatest British Actors , and he was number 6 on Britain's Finest Actors . It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score for Peter Gabriel . Good !
573274	4248714	1126596	6.0	Adulthood	Originally just the writer of the first film , Kidulthood , Doctor Who's Noel Clarke also takes the director's chair for this sequel to the hit teenage social drama film . Basically , it has been six years since he killed Trife , and released from prison , Sam Peel ( Clarke ) can't escape the life he now doesn't want to live anymore . Jay ( Dead Set's Adam Deacon ) , a friend of Trife , wants to get revenge on Sam so much that he is prepared to have him killed . Sam is trying to get the message across to all after him that he no longer wants to create violence , and that he didn't mean to kill Trife . Lexi ( EastEnders ' Scarlett Alice Johnson ) is one of the only people on his side and trying to help him , but at the same time , she is willing to double cross to get what she wants , i . e . drugs . In the end , Sam and Jay confront each other , Jay with a gun and Sam with a baseball bat , and even though Jay can't face killing him , and Sam has tried to give his peace , Jay warns him that it isn't over . Also starring Jacob Anderson as Omen , Ben Drew as Dabs , Danny Dyer as Hayden , Kidulthood's Femi Oyeniran as Moony , Shanika Warren-Markland as Kayla , Kidulthood's Red Madrell as Alisa , Nathan Constance as Ike , Lenny Henry in Pieces ' Cornell John as Uncle Curtis and Don Klass as Blammy . Clarke deservedly won the BAFTA for Best Rising Star , he directs the film with great skill . It is a shame not all the same cast could come back , e . g . Jaime Winstone ( Ray's daughter ) and Rafe Spall ( Timothy's son ) , but it is a great sequel none-the-less . Good !
571916	4248714	95593	6.0	Married to the Mob	From director Jonathan Demme ( The Silence of the Lambs , Philadelphia ) , this thriller comedy may not have had much for me to laugh at , but it was a good film none the less . Basically Angela De Marco ( Golden Globe nominated Michelle Pfieffer ) is unhappily married to high Mafia member Frank ' The Cucumber ' De Marco ( Alec Baldwin ) , and it is when he is killed that she wants to break free from the Mafia world entirely and start a new life . But Frank's boss , Tony ' The Tiger ' Russo ( Oscar nominated Dean Stockwell ) manages to find and court her , so the FBI begins surveillance on her , thinking she is his mistress . She forms a close relationship with " neighbour " Mike Downey ( Matthew Modine ) , who is actually an undercover FBI agent , it is just a question of can she get away from the lifestyle she has lived in for so long . Also starring The Fisher King's Mercedes Ruehl as Connie Russo , Trey Wilson as FBI Field / Regional Director Franklin , Joan Cusack as Rose Boyle , Ellen Foley as Theresa , Eraser's Oliver Platt as Ed Benitez , Anthony J . Nici as Joey De Marco , Charles Napier as Ray - Angela's Hairdresser and Mars Attacks ! star O-Lan Jones as Phyllis . There are some good violent moments , the jokes aren't very noticeable , and the performances by Pfieffer , Modine and Stockwell are very good . Good !
571331	4248714	70379	6.0	Mean Streets	This is a bit of a landmark film as it was it was the first time director Martin Scorsese casted Robert De Niro , a collaboration that has continued in numerous films . It was also the second time he casted Harvey Keitel . Anyway , basically , set in the " mean streets " of New York City , the story follows small-time wise-guy community member Charlie ( Keitel ) , with friends Tony ( David Proval ) and Michael ( Richard Romanus ) , and most prominently , unreliable , near psychotic and to-be shunned friend Johnny Boy ( De Niro ) . He also has a secret girlfriend , Teresa ( Amy Robinson ) , Johnny Boy's cousin , who must also be shunned because of epilepsy . Charlie's uncle Giovanni ( Cesare Danova ) offers him a restaurant , and he is forced to choose between gaining power , love for Teresa , or protecting Johnny Boy . Also starring Victor Argo as Mario , Robert Carradine as Assassin , Jeannie Bell as Diane and David Carradine as Drunk , with narration by Scorsese himself . I will admit I did not pay full attention to this film , because it was a bit too chatty for my liking , but when it wasn't , it had great moments of violence , so it is worth watching . Good !
572540	4248714	64757	6.0	On Her Majesty's Secret Service	Golden Globe nominated Australian actor George Lazenby played Commander James Bond 007 in his one and only film , and the result afterwards ( at cinemas ) was that they wanted Sir Sean Connery back , and they got it in a really silly Diamonds Are Forever , and again 12 years later in Never Say Never Again . Anyway , he is quite cool , calm and posh like , but he does not have the same sense of humour or good acting style as Connery , or any of the other Bonds . In this , he basically has to stop SPECTRE boss Ernst Stavro Blofeld ( who he met in You Only Live Twice , here played by Telly Savalas ) from world domination , somehow . During the process he falls in love with Contessa Teresa ' Tracy ' Di Vicenzo ( Diana Rigg ) . He tells her that no other girl has touched him like her , and they marry at the end . Also starring Gabriele Ferzetti as Marc Ange Draco , Ilse Steppat as Irma Bunt , Angela Scoular as Ruby Bartlett , Lois Maxwell as Miss Moneypenny , George Baker as Sir Hilary Bray , Bernard Lee as M , Desmond Llewelyn as Q and a quick appearance by Joanna Lumley . James Bond was number 3 on 100 Years , 100 Heroes & Villains , he was number 21 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols , and he was number 21 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons , and the film was number 12 on James Bond's Greatest Hits for both the title theme music and Louis Armstrong's " We Have All the Time in the World " , and it was number 41 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers for the ending because their marriage lasts only five minutes . Good !
572036	4248714	454759	6.0	Zzzap !	When this was on CITV ( Children's Integalactic Television ) I used to think it was one of the best entertainment shows for kids , and you could enjoy every minute of it . With the great array of characters in the large comic book activated by remote control , there was never a dull moment . These great characters and acts included the mean keen Daisy Dare , Claire Macaulay ( Deborah McCallum ) , a blue glove and yellow glove both creating something , The Handymen ( Sarah Pickthall ) , the silly almost Mr . Bean like Cuthbert Lilly ( Richard Waites ) , my favourite creative and overactive artist Smarty Arty ( Art Attack's Neil Buchanan , who also created all colourful backgrounds ) . The only one I wanted ignore was the pretty ridiculous Smarty Arty replacement , Minnie the Mini Magician ( Sophie Aldred ) . It was nominated the BAFTA for Best Entertainment . Good for kids !
571547	4248714	424095	6.0	Flushed Away	Aardman Animations , creators of Wallace and Gromit , and Dreamworks computer animation , who created Shrek , bring the two together , might not be as charming as Claymation , but still fun . Basically Roddy St . James ( Hugh Jackman ) is the " society mouse " who lives in a posh Kesington flat . One day , a sewer rat named Sid ( EastEnders ' Shane Richie ) comes up through the sink , and decides he's hit the jackpot , and after trying to fool him to go into the toilet and get flushed , it is Roddy that gets flushed instead . He has now found himself in the sewer city of Ratropolis , and to try and get back home , he meets scavenger rat Rita ( Kate Winslet ) who has the faithful boat , the Jammy Dodger . She is being is chased by Whitey ( Bill Nighy ) and Spike ( The Lord of the Rings ' Andy Serkis ) , who work for villain The Toad ( Sir Ian McKellen ) . Originally they were chasing her for what turns out to be a non-valuable gem , but now she has his cable that controls his machine that opens the flood gates , and he plans to drown all during the World Cup match . Rita does manage to get Roddy home , after more chases , including with Le Frog ( Jean Reno ) , but he realises The Toad's plan , and goes back to both save Rita and the rat city , oh , and in the end , he stays , while Sid stays above , and has a new feline friend . Also starring Kathy Burke as Rita's Mum , Poirot's David Suchet as Rita's Dad and Miriam Margolyes as Rita's Grandma . Filled with some good ( if a little droll ) British humour , most giggles coming from the singing slugs , it is a good film for all the family . It was nominated the BAFTA for Best Animated Feature Film , and it was nominated the National Movie Award for Best Animation . Good !
572014	4248714	454921	6.0	The Pursuit of Happiness	Based on a true story , this is quite a good drama showing the traumas of poverty and homelessness , and how it affects family life . Basically it is the 1980's , and Chris Gardner ( Oscar ( the only one ) and Golden Globe nominated Will Smith ) is currently a struggling salesman who once a month sells hospitals little needed medical bone density scanners , and because of failing to make a decent living , his wife Linda ( Crash's Thandie Newton ) leaves him with their son , Christopher ( introducing Smith's real life son , Jaden Smith ) . Chris then has the inspiration to become a stockbroker , where he has a one in twenty chance for a full time ( and paid ) career . Meanwhile , he and Christopher are living as best they can on whatever they can get their hands on , as long as he can keep selling his scanners ( and not have them nicked ) . Their life starts to crumble though when they are forced out of their house , and are now homeless , with only the city shelter to go to . There is also a point when Christopher goes to prison . But their hope grows when he finally sells a scanner , that he had to mend , and he is more recognised at the company . In the end he achieves his dream , because he signed up the most companies ( due to his never hanging up the company phone ) and he is the company's new stockbroker , and a millionaire , the text at the end said he went on to more success . Also starring Brian Howe as Jay Twistle , James Karen as Martin Frohm , The Simpsons ' Dan Castellaneta as Alan Frakesh and Scary Movie's Kurt Fuller as Walter Ribbon . I like Smith's narration , there are some small comedic moments , and the relationship between him and his real son is strong , I can agree the film does focus on more despair , but that is the point for this quite realistic biographical drama . It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Song for " A Father's Way " . Will Smith was number 51 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars . Good !
573065	4248714	78480	6.0	Watership Down	Many people consider this animated film about the life of some on-the-move rabbits a sad film , but to be honest I didn't cry . Basically Hazel ( voiced by John Hurt ) and Fiver ( voice by Richard Briers ) are convinced that something bad is going to happen to their burrow . So they round up many other rabbits and set of on a journey to find a bigger and better land to live in . One or two rabbits , including Hazel kind of dies , but they do find this land . It's just a problem that the evil General already runs the show their . They are now in a small war with the bad rabbits for the land . Also starring the voice of Indiana Jones's Denholm Elliott as Cowslip . The theme song Bright Eyes by Art Garfunkel spent at least four to six weeks at number 1 . It was number 15 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers for Hazel's Death , it was number 44 on The 100 Greatest Family Films , and it number 86 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons . Good !

They throw in all the tempting elements until they decide to pull out a near realistic gun to commit the robbery . 3 out of the four do it ! A good trickery special showing how easily we can be tempted to do something . Good !
572281	4248714	280707	6.0	Gosford Park	From director Robert Altman ( MASH , Nashville ) , this period murder mystery feeling like an Upstairs Downstairs satire it is an all-star classic feeling drama .

573116	4248714	369735	6.0	Monster-in-Law	I was hoping this would be good , and it was , from the director of Legally Blonde . Basically Charlotte ' Charlie ' Cantilini ( Jennifer Lopez ) has finally found Mr . Right after years of looking , doctor surgeon Kevin Fields ( Michael Vartan ) , and eventually he proposes marriage . He tells the news to his possessive mother Viola ( Barbarella's Jane Fonda ) , who is recently trying to recover from a breakdown , so this news doesn't do a lot of favours . Viola has a secret plan while Kevin goes away for a little while , to drive Charlie as crazy as possible , i . e . being irritating . Charlie does eventually find out her secret plan from looking through her stuff , including finding out her pills are vitamin tablets , so in secret she gets her own back by doing exactly the same .

Also starring Wanda Sykes as Ruby , Adam Scott as Remy , Monet Mazur as Fiona , Annie Parisse as Morgan and Elaine Stritch as Gertrude . Fonda and Lopez have their great moments of torturing on each other , Sykes is really memorable with her voice and almost no-nonsense attitude , a funny film . Jane Fonda was number 98 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars . Good !
571897	4248714	75066	6.0	The Pink Panther Strikes Again	The only tiny problem with this sequel is , why is it still called Pink Panther , there's no diamond ! But who cares , this sequel is just as good as Return . The chief of police has gone insane and now wants his former detective assassinated as he plans to wipe out Washington . Detective Inspective Jacques Clouseau ( Golden Globe nominated Peter Sellers ) is now on vacation , although he does suspect someone is trying to kill him . His assistant Cato ( Burt Kwouk ) is still helping him train by fighting him , he even does it at the hilarious end . Still the same terrific accent by Sellers and the same well known theme tune by Henry Mancini !

Good !
572317	4248714	114148	6.0	Pocahontas	I would need to see it again to write a better review , but I am writing the basics and what I do remember about this Disney animated film . Basically Pocahontas ( Irene Bedard ) is the young Natiev American girl of the " New World " who is to be married to the village's greatest warrior , but she instead grows to love English sailor Captain John Smith ( Mel Gibson ) . So in short , a forbidden love story , some quarrelling , and in the end ( which I admit I remember crying to ) the lovers can't be with each other . Also starring Joe Baker as Lon , Christian Bale as Thomas , Billy Connolly as Ben , Linda Hunt as Grandmother Willow and David Ogden Stiers as Governor Ratcliffe and Wiggins . It won the Oscars for Best Music and Best Song for " Colors of the Wind " ( also won the Golden Globe ) , and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score . Good !
570943	4248714	117438	6.0	Ransom	Quite a thrilling film about a father's struggle with the loss , or rather finding , of his son . Young Sean Mullen is at the park with his Dad , and Mum on stage . He suddenly goes missing , and they discover when they get home that he has been kidnapped . He is being ransomed for $2 , 000 , 000 by the great villain , fake Detective Jimmy Shaker ( Gary Sinise ) . Tom Mullen ( Golden Globe nominated Mel Gibson ) , Sean's Dad is determined to do everything he can to get his son back . He eventually after a failed ransom drop-off decides to offer the money to capture the kidnapper ! Also starring Rene Russo as Kate Mullen , Sean's Mum , Delroy Lindo as Agent Lonnie Hawkins , Liev Schreiber as Clark Barnes and Saw II's Donnie Wahlberg as Cubby Barnes and Evan Handler as Miles Roberts . A good film from director Ron Howard ( Splash , A Beautiful Mind ) . Mel Gibson was number 17 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars . Good !
571715	4248714	284837	6.0	Ali G Indahouse	If you are a fan of smooth , hip talking or just a bit of hip hop , then you'll like this film , as for everyone else , you can enjoy Sacha Baron Cohen as the great Ali G . Borat ( Cohen ) also appears , but his own film is much better . Basically , Ali G lives in the West Side of Staines and is protesting about his Leisure Centre closing down . So he decides to join the Prime Minister ( Sir Michael Gambon ) and his nasty assistant David Carlton ( Charles Dance ) in parliament , hence the title , Indahouse . Also starring Kellie Bright as " me " Julie , Martin Freeman as Ricky C , the fit Rhona Mitra as Kate Hedges , Tony Way as Dave , EastEnders ' Nabil Elouhabi as Jezzy F and Ray Panthaki as Hassan B , Naomi Campbell , newsreader Jon Snow , EastEnders ' Rudolph Walker as President Mwepu , and Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan . Ali G was number 8 on The 100 Greatest TV Characters , he was number 6 on The 100 Greatest Funny Moments , along with Borat at number 24 ( and Bruno at number 77 ) , and he was number 6 on The World's Greatest Comedy Characters , with Borat at number 17 , and Sacha Baron Cohen ( or as the character ) was number 12 on Britain's Favourite Comedian . Good !
571985	4248714	253827	6.0	The Martins	From Tony Grounds , writer and director , also of that one-off special The Dinner Party ( which has the main star in it ) , this isn't a bad black comedy drama about the loser family trying to get a better life . Before I start , I have to say when I saw the poster , I thought it was some kind of spy or action comedy , but never mind . Anway , basically Robert Martin ( Lee Evans ) enters almost any competition going with big prizes , and his latest attempt saw him towards the finals rounds , but an elderly quite well-off family won instead , Robert obviously blames the paper because they want to make interesting reading . Robert is now on a little bit of rampage with a gun , that he is looking after for a " mate " , sticking it out to anyone who is ruining the chance to have a bit more of a better life , mostly for that " luxury holiday " he lost out on . This includes going to the competition runner Hatfield Recorder Editor ( Paddy Considine ) , and of course , the " undeserved " winners Mr . ( Frank Finlay ) and Mrs . Heath ( Barbara Leigh-Hunt ) for their tickets . While Robert and the family , wife and mother Angie ( Kathy Burke ) , her mother Anthea ( Linda Bassett ) , and the kids , young son Little Bob ( Eric Byrne ) and 14-year-old pregnant Katie ( Terri Dumont ) head off for their stolen holiday , the police are receiving many calls about a man with a gun threatening a school teacher , the competition guy , stealing pet birds , and the elderly couple trapped in the basement . As Robert and family get closer to the holiday , him and Angie seem to be drifting apart , especially when admits to cheating , and she decides that he should leave after the holiday's over . They get there , and are all satisfied , apart from Robert , who is pretty broken with the thought of leaving afterwards . In the end , after Katie has her baby with Robert's help , he is arrested ( falsely , well , apart from the gun stuff ) , a few months later he is released from prison , and it seems things go back to normal . Also starring Frank Finlay as Mr . Heath , Snatch's Lennie James as Police Constable Alex , Jack Shepherd as Detective Inspecter , Mark Strong as Doug , Lorraine Ashbourne as Lil , Tameka Empson as Mo , and a short but humorous appearance by Ray Winstone as Mr . Marvel . It is interesting to see Lee Evans playing a more human character , a family that swears almost as much as The Osbournes , a fun film with all the issues and similarity to a film by Mike Leigh , and a good mix of films Falling Down and The Pursuit of Happiness . Good !
572041	4248714	386032	6.0	Sicko	When I heard about this film , I got confused , because I thought it was about American waste disposal , but seeing this documentary about the American health care system is even better , from director Michael Moore . He basically showed us some examples of patients that had been dismissed treatment because of glitches in their medical history , they are unable to pay for the bills , or have no health / life insurance , and he also shows the consequences of these procedures . The documentary also shows some people responsible for making and carrying out these American procedures , and their consequences . But he is not just focusing on the American health service , he also came to Britain to see out free service help for the sick and needy . I hate to admit this , but I didn't realise , with the help of the NHS , that care and operations to treat , care and maybe even save a life is free , only unnecessary stuff like for example , a tit job , needs payment . France and Cuba are also focused as having either free service or great health service and facilities , even the secret and protected Guantanimo Bay is a target for Moore to help some friends who need medical attention , but can't get it in America . A good documentary that definitely shows America isn't all perfect , and they boast as the wealthiest nation in the world , well , here's a reason why . It was nominated the Oscar for Best Documentary , Features . Good !
572722	4248714	117060	6.0	Mission : Impossible	I have seen one or two pretty good roles by Tom Cruise , and I suppose this could be one of them . This is a film with some action , some hacking , some intelligence and directed pretty well from director Brian De Palma ( Scarface , The Untouchables ) . Basically Cruise is a secret agent working for an unknown agency , and they do lots of cool secret stuff to find stuff , and kind of stop the bad guys . Unfortunately , it looks like Ethan Hunt ( Cruise ) and his team were found out , and his group apart from him are dead . Now he is trying to get loads of contacts to help him find the truth , while at the same time help them , e . g . steal access codes in a list ( the best part ) . Also starring Jon Voight as Jim Phelps , Emmanuelle Béart as Claire Phelps , Jean Reno as Franz Krieger , Ving Rhames as Luther Stickell , Kristin Scott Thomas as Sarah Davies and Vanessa Redgrave as Max . Tom Cruise was number 32 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars , he was number 25 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols , and he was number 81 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons . Good !
571571	4248714	120915	6.0	Star Wars Episode I : The Phantom Menace	After the unexpected success of the three original films , George Lucas knew that one day he would have to make the prequels ( the old films being episodes IV , V and VI ) . So this is the first of the new prequels leading to the story of how Anakin Skywalker became Lord Darth Vader . Basically Jedi Knights Qui-Gon Jinn ( Liam Neeson ) and his apprentice Obi-Won Kenobi ( Ewan McGregor ) are trying to restore some order in the galaxy after the villains have started a battle , because of taxation . Along the journey they help Queen Padmé Naberrie Amidala ( Natalie Portman ) , meet 10-year-old Anakin ( Jake Lloyd ) who wins a pod race for them to get money to fix their ship , have many political discussions both about the war and Anakin's future , and have a war with the Gungans , droid armies and fighter pilots . Also starring Pernilla August as Shmi Skywalker , The Muppets ' Frank Oz ( aka Miss Piggy and Fozzie Bear ) as Yoda ( still a puppet , till the next two ) , Ian McDiarmid as Senator Palpatine / Darth Sidius , Ray Park as Darth Maul , Ahmed Best as Jar Jar Binks , Anthony Daniels as an uncovered C-3PO , Kenny Baker as R2-D2 , Terence Stamp as Supreme Chancellor Valorum , Brian Blessed as Boss Nass , Celia Imrie as Fighter Pilot Bravo 5 , Samuel L . Jackson as Mace Windu and Keira Knightley as Sabé . This along with the other two are never going to be as good for story , dialogue ( which is ridiculous ) or ' magic ' as the originals , but the special effects are never disappointing . It was nominated the Oscar for Best Sound Effects Editing , Best Visual Effects and Best Sound , and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Special Visual Effects and Best Sound . Star Wars was number 24 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons , and the film was number 28 on The Ultimate Film . Good !
571166	4248714	135730	6.0	It's a Mystery	When I was younger , and when it was sometimes repeated this was and kind-of still is one of the best and most mysterious kids programmes I know . Neil Buchanan from Art Attack hosts with a female host . Basically they try to solve mysteries of the world . These include aliens and UFOs , the Bermuder Triangle , vampires , disappearing houses , ghosts and many more weird and sometimes creepy mysteries . Every question was answered either with Solved or Unsolved . I personally think they did more unsolved mysteries than solved . Neil Buchanan was really good at adding slight humour and of course mystery to the questions and facts . Good !
571591	4248714	1297358	7.0	The Family	You may remember a documentary series ( and one of the first reality TV vehicles ) in the 1970's with the same title focusing on the lives of a working class family , well , now in the modern world , it was about time to see the lives of a regular middle-class family . With title narration by Life on Mars's John Simm , this documentary series on the lives of the Hughes family : mother / wife Jane , father / husband Simon , 19-year-old daughter Emily , 17-year-old daughter Charlotte , 14-year-old son Tom , family cat Ziggy , and ( seen most in the last episode ) oldest daughter Jess , living with fiancée Pat and baby daughter Ruby . The first five episodes each had narration from one of the family members , the rest of the episodes didn't . Anyway , each episode showed the typical day in the Hughes family , quite a few arguments about many things , e . g . bed time , a piercing , parenting , etc , but they do always make up in the end , and the episode they all really express happiness is the wedding of Jess and Pat , the final episode , and a happy ending . Very good !
571067	4248714	867148	7.0	The Crocodile Hunter : A Tribute to Steve Irwin	When I heard that Steve Irwin had died ( stingray attack ) , I knew I had to watch this as I used to find him really fun and interesting . When I actually watched this , I didn't realise he did that much for his home country and ours , it makes me wish I'd paid more attention than I actually did to him on TV . It was a really focus on the many programmes , documentaries and mainly contributions he has made for the world . With tributes from family and friends , including David Bellamy , Nigel Marven , Terry Nutkins Kathy Lette , Jono Coleman and Germaine Greer . A good archive documentary about a good man , he will be sorely missed . Very good !
572495	4248714	67116	7.0	The French Connection	The first time I saw this I almost ignored it because I fell asleep somewhere , but I'm glad I gave it a second chance . There was no way I was going ignore a film from The Exorcist director William Friedkin , especially as this was the film that won him the Best Director Oscar . Anyway , it is all about Det . Jimmy ' Popeye ' Doyle ( Oscar winning Gene Hackman ) on the lookout for criminals planning to ship many drugs through the United States . Doyle knows quite a lot about the criminal world , and his work buddy Det . Buddy ' Cloudy ' Russo ( Oscar nominated Roy Scheider ) is right behind him . I cannot remember all that much besides some chase sequences with the main villain , and the highlight of Doyle chasing the hit-man on the train . Also starring Fernando Rey as Alain Charnier , Tony Lo Bianco as Salvatore ' Sal ' Boca , Marcel Bozzuffi as Pierre Nicoli the Hit Man , Frédéric De Pasquale as Henri Devereaux and Bill Hickman as Bill Mulderig . Winner of three other Oscars , Best Picture , Best Film Editing and Best Writing , Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium , and nominated for Best Cinematography and Best Sound . Gene Hackman was number 42 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars , and he was number 31 on The World's Greatest Actor , Jimmy ' Popeye ' Doyle was number 44 on 100 Heroes & Villains , the film was number 8 on 100 Years , 100 Thrills , it was number 70 on 100 Years , 100 Movies , and it was number 74 on The 100 Greatest Films . Very good !
572881	4248714	486655	7.0	Stardust	I was obviously quite keen to see this at the cinema , I missed it , but when I saw it on DVD I was pretty satisfied , a good film from writer / producer / director Matthew Vaughn ( Layer Cake ) and co-writer Jane Goldman , wife of Jonathan Ross . Basically in a countryside town there is a mysterious wall to apparently another world , and the Guard ( Charlie and the Chocolate Factory's David Kelly ) is not letting anyone pass , but Dunstan Thorn ( Nathaniel Parker ) tricked his way past him , into the magical world of Stormhold . Years later , his son Tristan ( Charlie Cox ) is doing the same to get a falling star for his love Victoria ( Sienna Miller ) . When he gets there by black candle light , he lands in the star crater , and he meets the star , Yvaine ( Claire Danes ) . The don't realise it , but others are after Yvaine also , because with her heart they obtain eternal youth and life . Evil witch Lamia ( Michelle Pfeiffer ) is one of these people , and her youth obtained from another star is wearing away as she uses more of her powers in her search for Tristan and Yvaine . The film is basically a long journey across this magical land , with Tristan and Yvaine bumping into witches , pirates , including Captain Shakespeare ( Robert De Niro ) , and much more . Narrated by Sir Ian McKellen , and also starring Ricky Gervais as Ferdy the Fence , Peter O'Toole as King , Mark Strong as Septimus , Green Wing's Mark Heap as Tertius , Rupert Everett as Secundus , David Walliams as Sextus , Green Wing's Julian Rhind-Tutt as Quartus , Smack the Pony's Sarah Alexander as Empusa , Mark Williams as Billy and Dexter Fletcher as Skinny Pirate . A very good cast , some good special effects , and the Take That single " Rule The World " is fantastic , it was tipped for an Oscar nomination for Best Song , but it never received one ( instead three for The Golden Compass , and the winner was for that Irish film Once ) . Very good !
572816	4248714	114069	7.0	Outbreak	From director Wolfgang Petersen ( In the Line of Fire , Air Force One ) , this is really good film with a deadly virus spread by a cute monkey . Basically somewhere in Africa many people have been dying of an unknown virus , and it Col . Sam Daniels ' ( Dustin Hoffman ) job to make sure it does not spread any further . For now he investigating along with girlfriend Robby Keough ( Rene Russo ) , Maj . Salt ( Cuba Gooding Jr . ) and Maj . Casey Schuler ( Kevin Spacey ) to find the cause , the speed , the impact , and the cure ! The bad news is that he does not know what is causing it , and soon enough it spreads to America , and we know it is a monkey that is the cause / source . The virus pretty much makes your skin break up , melt kind of , and a lot of coughing and puking . Also starring Morgan Freeman as Brig . Gen . Billy Ford , Donald Sutherland as Maj . Gen . Donald McClintock and Patrick Dempsey as Jimbo Scott . With some action sequences , panicking , and a real bastard Sutherland , who thinks the situation will end if he blows up the town ! Very good !
572525	4248714	59711	7.0	Shenandoah	I have seen one or two western films with James Stewart , and this one is actually alright . He plays Charlie Anderson , a farmer who wants to look after his farm , but more importantly his family , and he is caught in the middle of the Civil War . He does not want to get involved because he , probably as a Christian , does not believe it his war to fight . But he does get involved when his younger son is kidnapped by the North . It is basically the story of all the events that happen to him and his family during the peril of the war . Also starring Doug McClure as Lt . Sam , Glenn Corbett as Jacob Anderson , Patrick Wayne as James Anderson , Golden Globe nominated Rosemary Forsyth as Jennie Anderson , Phillip Alford as Boy Anderson , Katharine Ross as Mrs . Ann Anderson , Charles Robinson as Nathan Anderson , James McMullan as John Anderson , Tim McIntire as Henry Anderson , Eugene Jackson Jr . as Gabriel and Paul Fix as Dr . Tom Witherspoon . It is a tiny bit slow at first , but it gets better after about a quarter of an hour . It was nominated the Oscar for Best Sound . Very good !
571217	4248714	167404	8.0	The Sixth Sense	You probably know the five human senses : Touch , Scent , Sight , Sound and Taste , and this is a terrifying idea for a sixth , from director M . Night Shyamalan ( also starring as Dr . Hill ) . Basically Malcolm Crowe ( Bruce Willis ) is a child psychologist recently awarded , and on the same night visited by a mad ex-patient who wounds him by gunshot . A few months later Malcolm is visited by the troubled 9-year-old Cole Sear ( Forrest Gump's Haley Joel Osment ) . He does not tell his secret for a while , but when he does , it is one of the iconic moments of the film , it was number 44 on 100 Years , 100 Quotes , " I see dead people " . It is because of this he is a freak in school , and his mother Lynn ( Toni Collette ) is very concerned about his increasing problems . Malcolm is now trying to find out whether he is seeing things or not , and trying to rekindle his relationship with wife Anna Crowe ( Olivia Williams ) . Also starring Saw II's Donnie Wahlberg as Vincent Gray , Glenn Fitzgerald as Sean , young Mischa Barton as Kyra Collins and Jurassic Park III's Trevor Morgan as Tommy Tammisimo . The film has a great conclusion as well with Cole's mother weeping at the idea of Cole seeing his Grandma , and Malcolm finding out why his wife has been ignoring him for so long , he wasn't wounded in that gunshot , he died . It was number 60 on 100 Years , 100 Thrills , and it was number 33 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments . Very good !
572129	4248714	299374	8.0	Richard & Judy	I don't watch it that often unless there is a really good celebrity guest appearing , but when I do watch this it's quite good . Richard Madeley and Judy present this quite good mid-day chat show which also includes some good competitions and latest news . The most interesting parts of the show for me are You Say We Pay where Richard and Judy guess what a caller is describing , and obviously when a guest is on . They've had Kacey Ainsworth , Les Dennis , Amanda Holden , Jessie Wallace , Sanjeev Bhaskar , Geri Halliwell , S Club 7 , Sophie Ellis-Bextor , Kyle MacLachlan , Simon Cowell , Delia Smith , Des O'Connor , Gina Yashere , Charlotte Church , Charlie Higson , Samantha Mumba , Gordon Ramsay , Danny Dyer , Billy Boyd , Dominic Monaghan , Zoë Wanamaker , Dido , Brian McFadden , Letitia Dean , Hear'say , James Nesbitt , Sir Ian McKellen , David Suchet , Alan Titchmarsh , Brenda Blethyn , Hugh Grant , Julie Walters , Daryl Hannah , Claire Sweeney , Tony Blackburn , Paul O'Grady , Tom Hanks , Holly Valance , Kim Cattrall , Sue Perkins , Graham Norton , Samuel L .

The only thing that's hard to get used is obviously Richard talking more than Judy , but apart from that it's fine occasionally . Richard Madeley was number 60 on The 100 Worst Britons , the programme was number 96 on The 100 Greatest Funny Moments for the Little Britain spoof , and it has been on all 100 Greatest TV Treats programmes so far . Very good !
571102	4248714	386224	8.0	Monkey Dust	Monkey Dust is quite a confusing cartoon with many different uses of animation . Every sketch of the show , unless they are using regular stories or characters , they change the type of animation used . There are some disturbing incidents in this show . There's drug use , suicide , some swearing , some light violence and much more . But it's just an example that a show will do pretty much anything to get laughs . But it does make you laugh occasionally . They have very short stories in pubs , hospitals , night clubs , homes , on the streets and many other outrageous or even normal places . I wouldn't say this was one of the best cartoon or animation shows , but it is good . It won the British Animation Award for Best Comedy . It was number 48 on The 100 Greatest TV Treats 2003 . Very good !
571473	4248714	373074	8.0	Kung Fu Hustle	Like Hero , House of Flying Daggers and Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon this film has the spectacular ( and slightly ridiculous ) visuals as key , but unlike them , director / writer / star Stephen Chow uses them for comedy purposes , and does so very well . Set in the 1940s , a town in China is ruled by the Axe Gang , and Sing ( Chow ) desperately wants to become a member . He stumbles into a slum ruled by eccentric landlords , who turn out to be disguised kung-fu masters . Sing's actions eventually causes the explosive kung-fu battle between the Axe Gang and slumlords . Only one side will win , and only one hero will emerge as the greatest kung-fu master of all . Also starring Wah Yuen as Landlord , Leung Siu-Lung as The Beast , Zhi Hua Dong as Donut , Chi Ling Chiu as Tailor , Yu Xing as Coolie , Chan Kwok-Kwan as Brother Sum , Chi Chung Lam , or Lam Tze Chung as Bone - Sing's Sidekick and Xiaogang Feng as Crocodile Gang Boss . The visuals mostly are what made me laugh a lot , including a running chase sequence with cartoon sound effects ( probably inspired from Road Runner ) , and the battle sequences are fun to watch too , a good action comedy . It was nominated the BAFTA and Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film . Very good !

Very good !
573139	4248714	206634	8.0	Children of Men	Based on the novel by P . D . James this is a pretty gritty vision of the future from director Alfonso Cuarón ( Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban ) . Basically , it is 2027 in England , and concerns of the nation are the rise in illegal immigrants and the infertility of women . The youngest person on Earth died , at 18 years old , and human life and its morals are almost becoming extinct . Theodore Faron ( Clive Owen ) finds an underground rebel band called The Fishes , and as he goes along with these people , one of which being ( for a little while ) Julian ( Julianne Moore ) , he finds the one thing that could change the course of humanity , the first pregnant woman is 18 years ! Now he , Kee ( Claire-Hope Ashitey ) and Miriam ( Matilda's Pam Ferris ) are on the run from the Human Project , so the baby ( after it's out ) is safe . Aging hippie Jasper ( Sir Michael Caine ) helps out for a while as well in the process of this important road trip . Also starring Love Actually's Chiwetel Ejiofor as Luke . The scenes when Owen is escaping gunfire in the wrecked streets is extraordinary when it doesn't cut for at least five minutes , even with red spots flicked on the camera . It was nominated the Oscars for Best Cinematography , Best Editing and Best Writing , Adapted Screenplay , and it won the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography and Best Production Design , and it was nominated for Best Special Visual Effects . Very good !
572924	4248714	884317	8.0	Star Stories	This is a really good satire comedy about the lives of well known celebrities / stars in the world . All the stories are true , but made like an episode of The League of Gentlemen , i . e . dark . Every episode they take famous celebrities known to us in Britain , whether single people or couples , and it gives us a new twist of all news we heard about them . The people they have mocked and made into genius Little Britain type characters so far are David and Victoria Beckham ( with The Spice Girls and Alex Ferguson ) , George Michael ( along with Sir Bob Geldof , Sir Elton John and Boy George ) , Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas ( with Mick Hucknall and Kirk Douglas ) , Madonna and Guy Ritchie ( with Vinnie Jones ) , Sadie Frost and Jude Law ( with Steven Spielberg and Sean Pertwee ) and Jennifer Aniston , Brad Pitt & Angelina Jolie ( with the Friends cast ) . The only member of the cast I can remember is Rhys Thomas from The Fast Show . Very good !
572653	4248714	395381	8.0	Britain's Best Sitcom	This was the voting show that I needed to see more than any other ( at the time ) . Jonathan Ross presented a show filled with 100 great sitcoms , e . g . Father Ted . But the last show was the most important , the top ten . We at home had to vote for our favourite sitcom with the help of opinions from their celebrity advocates . These celebrities included Carol Vorderman ( The Vicar of Dibley ) , Johnny Vaughan ( Porridge ) , Rowland Rivron ( One Foot in the Grave ) , Phill Jupitus ( Dad's Army ) , Clarissa Dickson-Wright ( Open All Hours ) , David Dickinson ( Only Fools and Horses ) , Armando Iannucci ( Yes , Minister ) , Ulrika Jonsson ( The Good Life ) , Jack Dee ( Fawlty Towers ) , and the one I wanted to win John Sergeant ( Blackadder ) . In the end , after nearly 12 million phone call votes it was between Blackadder and Only Fools and Horses . Only Fools and Horses won . Not a bad result , but it would have been nicer if it was Blackadder that won . But apart from that , a good programme .
572609	4248714	492430	8.0	The Jeremy Kyle Show	I must admit that a while ago I was too interested in all talk shows , even though Jerry Springer looked very good , and also I used to think the presenter of this show was a prick to his guests , but as I have watched more and more episodes I have grown to like his " technique " of talking . Jeremy Kyle has become one of the most entertaining British day-time shows in years , they have brought on / satellite talked to many people with known and regular problems , e . g . sleeping with people behind partner's backs , DNA tests to find a father to a baby , etc , but they have also done some disturbing material , including obesity , British drug addicts and gang members , beating husbands , and most memorable , some insane American atheists ( aka people who believe God is evil ! ) , and Kyle is like you bad tempered head teacher towards the guests , this is the main reason I have grown to love it , it's both great to see someone giving the same opinion the audience ( TV and studio ) have , and it can be quite funny . Very good !
571629	4248714	249462	8.0	Billy Elliot	I am quite keen on the films involving a dreaming and performing kid , and this one is no exception , from director Stephen Daldry ( The Hours ) . Basically Billy Elliot ( BAFTA winning Jamie Bell ) started out going for 50p to a boxing club , pretty normal for an eleven year old , and then he is fascinated by a ballet club , and he feels an urge to keep going . As he learns more and more moves , routine and poses from teacher Mrs . Wilkinson ( BAFTA winning , and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Julie Walters ) she is very impressed by his talent and enthusiasm . Eventually his Dad , Jackie ( Gary Lewis ) finds out his little secret and is quite appalled , threatening and despising . But Billy keeps working to achieve his dream for auditioning to join a professional ballet school . His brother Tony ( Jamie Draven ) obviously takes longer to get any reaction or care , but his Dad eventually gives in and is behind him at his audition . There is one point here I recognised particular words that Elton John borrowed for the lyrics of his song " Electricity " for Billy Elliot : The Musical , and after this he is successful , and when he leaves that is when his brother is quite emotional , and the coal mine strikes end . The dance routines from Bell as Jamie are fantastic , he's like a mini Fred Astaire for the 20th Century , and Walters is really good as the teacher . It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing , Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen , it won the BAFTAs for the Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film , and it was nominated for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music for Stephen Warbeck , Best Cinematography , Best Editing , Best Original Screenplay , Best Sound , the Carl Foreman Award for the Most Promising Newcomer for both director Stephen Daldry ( The Hours ) and writer Lee Hall , the David Lean Award for Direction and Best Film , and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama . Julie Walters was number 5 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses , and she was number 2 on Britain's Finest Actresses . Very good !
571026	4248714	44672	8.0	The Greatest Show on Earth	I've hardly ever been to a real circus , so that is one reason for me seeing this film , to see an idea of what it is like at a circus . Basically it is showing some of the personal stories between performers at the circus , the relationships they share and the lives they live for the circus . Charlton Heston as Brad Braden , the manager of The Greatest Show on Earth is quite a nice guy , but sometimes he worries about his circus performers disappointing audiences . But for me , the actor that stole most of the film , never without makeup on , was James Stewart as Buttons the Clown . He really steals the show near the end of the film when the circus train crashes and he acts as a doctor . It won the Oscars for Best Picture and Best Writing , Motion Picture Story , and it was nominated for Best Costume Design , Best Film Editing and Best Director for Cecil B . DeMille , and it won the Golden Globes for Best Cinematography , Best Director and Best Motion Picture - Drama . It was number 32 on The Ultimate Film . Very good !
571742	4248714	55798	8.0	Birdman of Alcatraz	From director John Frankenheimer ( The Manchurian Candidate [ 1962 ] , Deception ) , this is a wonderful prison drama , worthy of The Shawshank Redemption , with a very admirable leading character played by an actor in his finest role . Based on the true story , prisoner Robert Stroud ( BAFTA winning , and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Burt Lancaster ) was convicted of murder twice , the second being a prison guard , he was sentenced to life in solitary confinement . One day , while wandering in the prison courtyard , he finds a sickly sparrow and decides to take care of it . He manages to cure it , and trains it to fly , after the new warden , replacing Harvey Shoemaker ( Karl Malden ) allows him to keep the bird , many other prisoners are allowed pet birds too , and as more and more of them are refused by other inmates , Stroud finds a new purpose for life by taking care of and studying these birds ( canaries ) . It is when they all start dying of a mysterious illness that he finds , with help , a new medicine to cure them , and it sparks the interest Stella Johnson ( Betty Field ) who wants to sell it to other bird owners . There is a point when a new appointed warden makes the rule to not allow animals into prison cells , but with the help of Stella , including marriage , which his mother Elizabeth ( Rear Window's Oscar nominated Thelma Ritter ) does not approve of , Stroud makes the front page of the newspaper . He has now become really renowned for his work with birds , i . e . ornithology , and has written a book about it , and he is just the slightest obsessive and eccentric in age as well . This bird hobby is cut short when Stroud is transferred to Alcatraz prison , where they allow no animals whatsoever , and he obviously can't appeal for it , so he is mainly quiet in his prison cell , only writing another book , until a riot threatens the lives of all prisoners , and only Stroud on the speaker to old warden Shoemaker can stop it . In the end , after stopping the Alcatraz riot , he is transferred again to a hospital , but appealing for freedom failed . Also starring Neville Brand as Bull Ransom , Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Telly Savalas as Feto Gomez , Edmond O'Brien as Tom Gaddis ( also narrating ) , Hugh Marlowe as Roy Comstock , Whit Bissell as Dr . Ellis , Crahan Denton as Kramer and James Westerfield as Jess Younger . Apparently Lancaster's portrayal wasn't much like the real man , but his performance was so good for me , I think he should have won the Oscar ( and Golden Globe ) instead of the overrated ( in my opinion ) performance by Gregory Peck in To Kill a Mockingbird . It was nominated the Oscar for Best Cinematography . Burt Lancaster was number 19 on 100 Years , 100 Stars - Men , and he was number 48 on The World's Greatest Actor , and the film was number 76 on 100 Years , 100 Cheers . Very good !
571732	4248714	120917	8.0	The Emperor's New Groove	For a Walt Disney Pictures film , this is much more hipper , groovy and fun than many others . David Spade voices and narrates as Emperor Kuzco , he is the selfish young emperor who has everything he wants . He plans to build a new summer pool on a village hilltop where peasant Pacha ( John Goodman ) lives . Yzma ( Eartha Kitt ) , the villain turns Kuzco into a llama and , eventually , both him and Pacha are lost in the wilderness . They travel towards the palace , and Pacha thinks that within four days Kuzco will change his mind about the pool on his hilltop . Meanwhile Yzma is searching with her dopey sidekick Kronk ( Patrick Warburton ) for Kuzco when she finds out he is not dead . With a really good Oscar and Golden Globe nominated song by Sting , " My Funny Friend and Me " , and Sir Tom Jones singing as Kuzco's Theme Song Guy , this is great fun for all the family . Very good !
572064	4248714	108967	9.0	A Touch of Frost	You've probably heard of the Christmas character that makes it snow , well here is a Detective Inspector with that same name . Basically this is a cross between Inspector Morse with an Only Fools and Horses popular sitcom character . Sir David Jason plays DI William George ' Jack ' Frost ( hence the same name ) , a professional , determined and easily annoyed crime investigator . Usually every episode is either a murder or a disappearance of someone . All the cases are always gripping , the characters in the story are always good ( especially when you suspect them of the crime ) , and Jason is just the best part of it . Jason makes the role his own , adds the humour and the drama , and just makes it a watchable show . Sir David Jason was number 1 on TV's 50 Greatest Stars , D . I . Jack Frost was number 42 on The 100 Greatest TV Characters , and the programme was number 3 on ITV : 50 Greatest Shows . Very good !
573104	4248714	1083512	9.0	The Simpsons : a Culture Show Special	Not long before the anticipated release of their movie , and after celebrating the 400th episode and 20 years , The Culture Show paid homage to the great success of The Simpsons with this special half-hour documentary about them . Hosted by Lauren Laverne ( who co-hosts Culture Show along with the great film critic Mark Kermode ) , this programme basically looked back from their first appearance on The Tracey Ullman Show in 1987 and episodes gone by to see why everyone loves this cartoon sitcom so much . This included the key and supporting characters , the jokes , the celebrity appearances , the writers , the mocking of everyday things , and much more , a great one-off documentary with plenty of clips , information and opinion to keep you interested . With contributions from creator Matt Groening , Ricky Gervais , Nick Park , Stephen Hawking , Phill Jupitus , Helen Fielding and Johnny Vegas . Very good !
572803	4248714	299302	9.0	Friday Night with Jonathan Ross	When there's nothing else good on Friday nights , this is probably the best show to watch . It's basically like a comedy chat show with the popular critic , actor and chat show host , slightly wobbly mouthed twice BAFTA and British Comedy Award winning , and National Television Award nominated Jonathan Ross . Throughout the show he has had many wonderful and famous people on the show , not counting Four Poofs and a Piano singing as they enter . My favourite episode so far has still been the one with Chris Tarrant , Johnny Vegas and Jim Carrey . You know what Carrey's like , they basically sang a chosen song as loud as possible and wrecked the studio . And it was the last in the Series ! Ross adds both humour and seriousness to make this show a very good award winner . It has been on all 100 Greatest TV Treats programmes so far . It won the BAFTAs for the Lew Grade Award ( also nominated ) , it won the British Comedy Awards for Best Comedy Entertainment Programme , and it was nominated the National Television Awards for Most Popular Entertainment Programme ( three times ) . Very good !
572127	4248714	431559	9.0	The Paul O'Grady Show	The weird voiced comedian best known for playing the nasty Lily Savage now his own mid-day chat show , beating Richard & Judy , it even won a BAFTA . Paul O'Grady is just the perfect host for this show who makes us laugh , gives us competitions and invites some very good guests . He obviously gets more viewers than Richard & Judy because he is more watchable , and he deserved the BAFTA ( although it would have been nice if it was TV Burp ) , he was also nominated a National Television Award . He's had Jo Brand , Simon Cowell , Donny Osmond , Martine McCutcheon , Harry Hill , Matthew Kelly , Martin Kemp , Deborah Stevenson , Lulu , Sally Lindsay , Dolly Parton , Lee Ryan , Daniel Bedingfield , Fern Britton , Phillip Schofield , Jessie Wallace , Dannii Minogue , Sir Cliff Richard , Jennie Bond , Darius , David Dickinson , Derek Acorah , Nadia Almada , Jamelia , Lesley Joseph , Richard Whiteley , Sharon Osbourne , Barbara Windsor , Lorraine Kelly , Cilla Black , McFly , Michael Ball , Kate Thornton , Todd Carty , Michael Winner , Jon Culshaw , Jan Ravens , Blue , Cat Deeley , Jade Goody , Seal , Chris Tarrant , Wendi Peters , Al Murray , Lemar , Jane Danson , Brian Blessed , Pam Ferris , Natalie Cassidy , Jools Holland , Sir Tom Jones , Kim Cattrall , John Savident , Ruby Wax , Davina McCall , James Alexandrou , Beverley Knight , Michael Parkinson , Boy George , Ricky Gervais , Ewan McGregor , Aled Jones , Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly , Natalie Imbruglia , Celia Imrie , Eamonn Holmes , Natasha Bedingfield , Rachel Stevens , Brian Conley , The Rock , Uma Thurman , John Travolta , Pete Waterman , Antony Cotton , Vernon Kay , Janet Street-Porter , Lauren Bacall , Jean-Christophe Novelli , Danniella Westbrook , June Sarpong , Joe Pasquale , Lucy-Jo Hudson , Martin Freeman , Bill Nighy , Jill Halfpenny , Sir Roger Moore , Shane Richie , Lenny Henry , Billy Murray , Robert Downey Jr . , Patsy Kensit , Sir Ian McKellen , Steve Brookstein , Carol Smillie , Kathy Burke , Catherine Tate , Jim Bowen , Julian Clary , Rob Brydon , Shobna Gulati , Peter Davison , Geri Halliwell , Jonathan Wilkes , Kenny Baker , Honor Blackman , Charlotte Church , William Roache , Ruby Wax , Sir Terry Wogan , Suranne Jones , Mariah Carey , Jack Dee , Sheryl Crow , Carol Vorderman , Jack Osbourne , Rob Schneider , Terry Jones , Rik Mayall , Denise Van Outen , Des Lynam , Wendy Richard , Richard Wilson , Dame Kelly Holmes , Joan Rivers , Status Quo , Martin Clunes , Sir Trevor McDonald , Stephen Mulhern , Craig David , Ricky Tomlinson , Rod Stewart , Alice Cooper , Anastacia , June Brown , Kim Woodburn and Aggie MacKenzie , Timothy Spall , Ozzy Osbourne , Neil Morrissey , Will Young , Noddy Holder . . . .

573176	4248714	100802	9.0	Total Recall	From director Paul Verhoeven ( RoboCop , Showgirls , Starship Troopers ) this is a fantastic science-fiction action thriller , even if it does cause questions . It is the future , 2084 , and Douglas Quaid ( Arnold Schwarzenegger ) is a normal construction worker haunted by a dream to go to the planet Mars , so one day he decides to go to the memory implant vacation company , Rekall , for a trip , he also accepts the experience of being a secret agent .

After escaping the assassins , and getting a suitcase of gadgets , fake IDs and cash , and discovering he is Hauser , a former Mars Intelligence agent , he goes to the colony on Mars for answers . There he meets Melina ( Rachel Ticotin ) working for the rebels , and soon enough he finds out the assassins are working for great arsehole villain Vilos Cohaagen ( RoboCop's Ronny Cox ) . While finding answers , and questioning reality , Doug , and Melina plan to stop Cohaagen's dastardly rule of the planet by activating an alien machine ( started by hand ) that is supposed to provide oxygen for the whole of Mars . Also starring Michael Ironside as Richter , Twins ' Marshall Bell as George / Kuato , Mel Johnson Jr . as Benny , Michael Champion as Helm , Roy Brocksmith as Dr .

571189	4248714	462071	9.0	The 100 Greatest War Films	My brother has a big interest in anything to do with war , so it was pretty obvious that he would watch this very interesting documentary . It was basically another 100 Greatest countdown based on past and popular war films , including : The Eagle Has Landed , Cold Mountain , The Birth of a Nation , Regeneration , El Cid , Cromwell , Gone with the Wind , Ride with the Devil , Oh ! What a Loveley War , Enigma , The English Patient , From Here to Eternity , Troy , Three Kings , A Matter of Life and Death , Master and Commander : The Far Side of the World , Patton , Empire of the Sun , Lawrence of Arabia , Henry V , The Last of the Mohicans , Kelly's Heroes , All Quiet on the Western Front , The Pianist ; Good Morning , Vietnam , Casablanca , Enemy at the Gates , Spartacus , Gladiator , MASH , Where Eagles Dare , The Longest Day , Born on the Fourth of July , Dr .

Very good !
572272	4248714	241527	9.0	Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone	The first of the popular books by J . K . Rowling was one of the most anticipated films at the time , and it became one of the most successful family films in cinema , from director Chris Columbus ( Home Alone , Mrs . Doubtfire ) . Harry Potter ( Daniel Radcliffe ) has lived with his Uncle Vernon ( Richard Griffiths ) and Aunt Petunia ( Fiona Shaw ) and their son since he was a baby . Then one day , after attacks by letters for him , Rubeus Hagrid ( BAFTA nominated Robbie Coltrane ) takes Harry to be taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry . He takes money from the Wizard Bank and buys a wand from Mr . Ollivander ( John Hurt ) on the way , and he also finds out he is famous for surviving an attack by He Who Must Not Be Named , explaining the scar on his forehead . When Harry is on his way to Hogwarts at London Liverpool Station he needs to find Platform 9 and 3 quarters , and asking Mrs . Molly Weasley ( Julie Walters ) he goes through a wall between platforms 9 and 10 . On the train he meets Ron Weasley ( Rupert Grint ) , and briefly Hermoine Granger ( Emma Watson ) . Then at the school , they meet Professor Minerva McGonagall ( Dame Maggie Smith ) , the mean Slytherin bound Draco Malfoy ( Tom Felton ) , before going in front of Professor Albus Dumbledore ( Richard Harris ) and the other teachers to be put into the appropriate houses by the wizard hat . The film continues to see their lessons with teachers , including Professor Severus Snape ( Alan Rickman ) teaching potions , Madame Hooch ( Zoë Wanamaker ) teaching broom flying , and Professor Flitwick ( Leprechaun's Warwick Davis , also playing Goblin Bank Teller ) teaching levitation . Then is the first and ( then ) gripping Quidditch game , Gryffindor vs . Slytherin with Harry as the seeker trying to catch the Golden Snitch to win the game , while everyone scores with the Quaffel . But as time goes by , Harry , Ron and Hermoine discover a plan to steal something guarded by the giant two-headed dog ( Fluffy ) , that they later find out is called the Philosopher's Stone ( the Americans insist on calling the boring Sorcerer's Stone ) . Harry and the other two eventually pluck up the courage to get past the dog , and traps , including Devil's Snare plants , flying keys ( to the door ) and the giant game of Wizard's Chess . Harry eventually faces his great foe , and he suspected the very mysterious Snape , but it was in fact Professor Quirinus Quirrell ( Ian Hart ) , but the real villain is on the back of his head , Harry's parents killer Vodermort , aka He Who ( well , you know the rest ) . Harry survives and kills Voldermort and Quirrel , is reunited with his friends , Gryffindor deservedly wins the house cup , and Harry goes home with great memories . Also starring John Cleese as Nearly Headless Nick and David Bradley as Argus Filch . It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration , Best Costume Design and Best Music for John Williams , and it was nominated the BAFTAs for the Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film , Best Feature Film ( Children's Award ) , Best Special Visual Effects , Best Costume Design , Best Make Up / Hair , Best Production Design and Best Sound . Harry Potter was number 45 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons , but he was also number 35 on The 100 Worst Britons ( the only fictional person , why ? ) , the film was number 11 on The Ultimate Film , and it was number 15 on The 100 Greatest Family Films . Very good !
572921	4248714	884355	9.0	The Best of the Worst	Hosted by the great Alexander Armstrong with team captains David Mitchell and Johnny Vaughn , this is great comedy celebrating the very best of the very bad . They basically go through four rounds : The Worst of Four things , e . g . cosmetic surgery , Top 5 Worst something , e . g . World Record , Which Ends the Worst ( choose one of two clips ) and One Off Worst Things to guess . This is a really good twist on the Have I Got News For You and Never Mind The Buzzcocks format , because they are mocking what they should mock . They always have really good guests on the show as well . They have had Brian McFadden , Trisha Goddard , Paddy McGuinness , Liza Tarbuck , Alan Carr , Robert Webb , Mel Giedroyc , Sara Cox , Fearne Cotton , Frankie Boyle , Rob Rouse and Jayne Middlemiss . It is clever , funny , interesting for facts , and a good show , just as good as 8 of 10 Cats ! Very good !
572974	4248714	69704	9.0	American Graffiti	I have seen many teen movies , but this classic 70's one is a great film for both stars , writing and directing credits . The most basic plot of this story seems to be that all the key characters are driving around when they could be at a final party before leaving to get on a plane . The actors that play these key characters have become big stars in their own rights , and they deserve it after their great youthful performances . These include Curt Henderson ( Jaws ' Richard Dreyfuss , nominated for Golden Globe ) who is searching for a particular girl while hanging out with what seem to be thugs , Steve Bolander ( A Beautiful Mind director Ron Howard ) is trying to patch things up with his girlfriend , John Milner ( Golden Globe winning Paul Le Mat ) is having to look after a 16 year old and she can get annoying , and Terry ' The Toad ' Fields ( The Untouchables ' Charles Martin Smith ) seems to have finally found someone that likes him . Also in a couple of scenes is the man that the film's Oscar and Golden Globe nominated director George Lucas would eventually cast as Han Solo and Indiana Jones , Harrison Ford as Bob Falfa . Some great moments of comedy and some sentiment , my favourite character was probably Terry . It was nominated the Oscars for Best Supporting Actress for Candy Clark as Debbie Dunham , Best Film Editing , Best Writing , Story and Screenplay Based on Factual Material or Material Not Previously Published or Produced and Best Picture , it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Supporting Actress for Cindy Williams as Laurie Henderson , and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical / Comedy . It was number 43 on 100 Years , 100 Laughs , and it was number 77 on 100 Years , 100 Movies . Very , very good !
571656	4248714	469139	9.0	Mr . Countdown : A Tribute to Richard Whiteley	When Richard Whiteley OBE died , I personally was shocked because not only and he left behind one of the best tea-time game shows , he was irreplaceable ( but Des Lynam is good too ) . This was an essential documentary focusing on the bumbling , humorous and really lovable host of the first programme to feature on Channel 4 in 1982 . With tributes from Lesley Garrett , Sir Tim Rice , and of course his co-host , Carol Vorderman . This tribute showed many of the great moments from Countdown , but also other great moments of his including his news reports , and of course , the ferret biting him ( if he is going to be remembered for something besides Countdown , it's that ) . Richard Whiteley will be sorely missed , he has left a legend behind as not only the first host of Countdown , but the first person on Channel 4 . Note : My Mum's best friend went on the show once while he was hosting . Very good !
572763	4248714	60196	9.0	The Good , the Bad and the Ugly	This was the third of the trilogy ( A Fistful of Dollars and A Few Dollars More ) . I can agree that this has more violence , a more interesting story and plot line , and the villain is different . Basically the film first introduces the ugly , he wasn't as ugly as one of the bad's henchmen . Then the bad is introduced , he has those eyes that villains should have . And obviously , the good is the ever popular cowboy " man with no name " played by Clint Eastwood . The final showdown is pretty interesting , three men , not two , and a good villain death , falling into an empty grave . All fighting for some hidden gold , and Clint is nice letting his friend , the ugly getting half the gold , but why nearly hang him ? Clint Eastwood was number 18 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars , and he was number 61 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons , and the film was number 46 on The 100 Greatest Films . Very good ( very bad and very ugly , LOL ) !
573120	4248714	1034201	9.0	Britain's Got Talent	If you like ( reality ) entertainment shows , e . g . The X Factor , The Apprentice , Dragon's Den , etc , finding the newest talent from the country , then this is the show with it all . Hosted by Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly , this new show set out to find the best talent that would have the chance to win £100 , 000 , and the chance to perform in front of The Queen at The Royal Variety Performance . The judges were ex-newspaper editor and media baron Piers Morgan , actress of stage and screen Amanda Holden ( who performed there herself ) , and the always popular music producer Simon Cowell . The show had no rules about age or act , they just wanted anyone to turn up who thought they had something to impress the judges , and the theatre audience in the auditions . The difference here is not just the audience , but the judges have the opportunity to stop the act with three X buzzers . The acts that got through to the semi-finals were all great in their own ways , and most deserved to get to the final . These included Damon Scott with Bubbles the Monkey , singer Dominic Smith , dance group MD Productions , The Freerunners , musicals performer Bessie Cursons , Kombat Breakers , male baton twirler Craig Womersley , acro-balancers Crazee Horse , ten-year-old comedian Jake Pratt , dance group The Mini-Mezzos , 6-year-old singer Connie Talbot , The Bar Wizards , singer Tony Laf , break dancer Scott Holtom , beat boxers Crew 82 , comedy impressionist Mike Garbutt , and deserved winner , opera singer Paul Potts . Ant and Dec were number 56 , and Simon Cowell number 33 on The 100 Worst Britons ( why ? ) , Cowell was number 28 , and Ant and Dec number 7 on TV's 50 Greatest Stars , and Cowell was number 67 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols . Very good !
570964	4248714	218760	9.0	Don't Try This at Home !	This used to be one of the best shows on a Saturday night ! Davina McCall hosted a show where basically they bring in professionals , and sometimes an audience member to perform something that should not be attempted at home . They even got someone to pick one of three envelopes for a special challenge near the end of the show . They had people lying on nails , walking on hot ashes , swimming with sharks , going across a rope bridge in a car , climbing very high mountains , eating breaded sheep's testicles , eating live maggots , and getting people over their fear of bugs , snakes , and bananas ? ! There were many other nasty or disgusting things to " NOT " do on the show . Very good !
571289	4248714	372743	10.0	The 100 Greatest Movie Stars	This was probably one of the most essential 100 Greatest that I can remember , I just needed to know who the public ( including me ) had voted as the greatest movie star .

572427	4248714	35093	10.0	Mrs . Miniver	17 years before the 11-Oscar-winning Ben-Hur , Oscar winning director William Wyler created this superb wartime melodrama , Winston Churchill even praised it . Basically , the Minvers are an English " middle-class " family living in World War II . Throughout the film they have to put up with dodging bombs , the Miniver's son Toby ( Christopher Severn ) is trying to get with the granddaughter of Lady Beldon ( Oscar nominated Dame May Witty ) , and a contest for the person with the best rose , one being named after the film's heroine , Mrs . Kay Miniver ( Oscar winning Greer Garson ) against Lady Beldon's . The film is basically made up of many social conversations , wartime incidents and trauma , and great sentiment . Also starring Forbidden Planet's Oscar nominated Walter Pidgeon as Clem Miniver , Oscar winning Teresa Wright as Carol Beldon Miniver , Reginald Owen as Foley , It's a Wonderful Life's Oscar nominated Henry Travers as Mr . Ballard , Richard Ney as Vin Miniver and Henry Wilcoxon as Vicar My favourite moments include the escaped German threatening Mrs . Miniver with a gun for food , only to be arrested , the bomb raid where the Miniver family are in their shelter , Travers winning the rose competition , and many plane crashes . Great acting , great effects ( for the time ) and great period drama , even the tag-line says " voted the greatest movie ever made " , I can agree it is a must see . The sequel , The Miniver Story that followed in 1950 is meant to be poor . It won Oscars for Best Cinematography , Best Writing , Screenplay and Best Picture , and it was nominated for Best Special Effects , Best Film Editing and Best Sound .

571739	4248714	83866	10.0	E . T . the Extra-Terrestrial	I remember seeing it as a kid , and the ending making me cry , and seeing it again ( properly ) , it is a great film from Oscar , BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Steven Spielberg . He based it mainly on his childhood , the divorce his parents and wanting a friend . Anyway , an alien is left behind on Earth , and young Elliot ( BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Henry Thomas ) befriends him , along with his older brother Michael ( Robert MacNaughton ) and younger sister Gertie ( 7-year-old BAFTA nominated Drew Barrymore ) . They teach him how to speak and keep him safe from harm of the adults ( who you see from the point of view of E . T . or a kid , i . e . mainly just legs ) . E . T . unfortunately has some kind of accident and is discovered by the government who try to save him . The bicycle flying is wonderful , especially across the Moon ( which became Amblin Entertainment's logo ) , the Oscar winning music by John Williams is magical , and E . T . is a very lovable character . The extra footage put in , and some reconstructed as part of the 20th anniversary re-release is also quite fun .

570904	4248714	43456	10.0	The Day the Earth Stood Still	I first saw this classic film on a poster in McDonalds and thought it looked pretty cool , especially the thought of our planet stopping ( imagine the consequences ) . Of course when I actually saw the film it wasn't what I had in mind for the Earth standing still , but it was pretty freaky . Anyway , basically an alien craft from a distant place lands in a football field , and Klaatu ( Michael Rennie ) is the human looking alien that comes out , as well as his spooky robot Gort ( Lock Martin ) who can zap things and make them vanish . Anyway , Klaatu pretending to be Carpenter to all who don't know him , befriends some people including cute Bobby Benson ( Billy Gray ) , but he isn't on Earth to make friends , he needs to warn that the planet is in danger . To make his point and show what he is capable of to Prof . Jacob Barnhardt ( Sam Jaffe ) he freezes all electricity in the world ( apart from needed ones like hospitals and airports ) for half an hour . It nearly looks like he dies , but in the end everyone hears him out . Also starring Patricia Neal as Helen Benson and Hugh Marlowe as Tom Stevens . It won the Golden Globe for Best Film Promoting International Understanding , and it was nominated for Best Score for Bernard Herrmann . It was number 82 on 100 Years , 100 Thrills , and it was number 67 on 100 Years , 100 Cheers . Outstanding !

She then hears about " exorcism " and decides to let priest Father Damien Karras ( Oscar nominated Jason Miller ) have a look at her . He discovers the girl is possessed by the devil himself . He gets permission from the church to perform the exorcism with the help of the very old Father Lankester Merrin ( Flash Gordon's Ming , Golden Globe nominated Max Von Sydow ) . An essential film filled with horrifying effects and lots of devilish moments , including projectile vomiting , head twisting , strong swearing ( the ' c ' word ) , masturbating with a crucifix and stuffing her mother's head up her blood covered skirt , pretty hard to deal with , but it is the devil .
