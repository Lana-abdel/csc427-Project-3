Hannigan looks very embarrassed to be in this movie and should fire her agent , right now ! ! . it is not even funny in the slightest . we have been spoon fed as an audience , fart gags , boob gags , bodily fluid gags , stupid unfunny movie references , Micheal Jackson sight gags , animals using toilets gags and celebrity look a like gags for far too long , and i for one are really sick of these films now . please stop this torture now . there are not enough years in peoples lives to have time wasted on drivel like this , the eighty minutes felt like i was watching the lord of the rings trilogy and i knew this was going to be bad the minute ' hitch ' was spoofed . almost every recent successful film made is referenced in this , and some of the spoofs are as pointless as a broken pencil ( see the dodgeball spoof or the kill bill spoof ) . please if you do get to rent this film , be careful and do not tell anyone , you will be mocked . i feel totally disgusted that a film like this ever crossed my eyes and ears . shockingly bad .

Snipes stays third in the direct to DVD championship at the moment , way behind Seagal and Van Damme , and that is saying something . for die hard Snipes fans only . . . . or sadists

Tim Allen stars in another dog of a movie . this time , he plays a reformed superhero who is lured back out of retirement by Chevy Chase and a promise of 500 , 000 dollars . he has to train the quartet of troubled teens , one who is super-strong , one who is fat and can get fatter , one who can turn invisible , and one who can move things using the mind . and Courtney Cox , who literally blows in this movie . so the movie is about finding ones self and realising that although that you are different , you are a special individual . didn't Christine Aguillera sing about this already . a very unfunny movie which relies heavily on other movies such as the incredibles and the previous years sky high . Tim Allen appears to e on auto pilot for the majority of the film and has something cocky to say to every syllable that is uttered to him , ehich is really painful considering the script is so bad . Chase looks embarrassed to be involved in the movie and looks like he is just thinking about what he could spend his paycheck on ( probably looking for a new agent ) . but the worse to come out of this is Cox , who is just plain awful , and may find it difficult to continue to be the second most successful one from friends ( scream was a hit , but that was ten years ago ) and plays the Julianne Moore card ala ' Evolution by falling over every other minute for laughs . it doesn't work . all in all a plain , boring movie , which doesn't help by an unfunny script and uninvolved characters .

Micheal carter has a perverse obsession , over feeding women . he feels it is something they should have as they are goddesses and the people who consume are the strongest people on the earth , and those who do not ( supermodel , etc ) are the weak minded on this planet . but what his victim , Deidre does not know is that Carter is placing bets on line as to when she will expire , by taking her vital observations and recording them for all to see . Phillip Jackson is an Australian cop who comes across the website and decides to investigate the case further , as he is used to dealing with the psychotic variety of the human species . but Jackson soon finds out that the fine lines between victim and killer can soon become blurred . the tag-lines were very predictable'feels like se7en ' ' on a par with silence of the lambs ' ' grossly scary ' and other clich√©d summaries . the director is not the greatest in Brett Leonard ' the lawnmower man ' ' virtuosity'but i thought i would give the film a chance . the first 30 minutes was very good and interesting showing both perspective of cop and killer , mixed with some very ironic soundtrack music . this could have been very good if the film did not go off the different path and start to walk on the ' serial killer thriller with silly twist at the end ' road . once Jackson walks on to American soil , the film loses all its originality and shock value , and turns into an excuse to get the audience to feel nauseous and cause a bit of controversy . the problem is that you are so bored with the story and laughing at the terrible dialogue , that shock value is worthless and you are just waiting to see what silly twist the writers have up their sleeve . the most annoying thing about the movie is Carter , who is not a convincing villain and looks like a cut-price Jay Mohr . we are supposed to believe that he is a victim because he had a troubled life and was affected by this . but as all psychos go , he is a charming , well educated man , with a beautiful wife and house and . . . . yawn . we get on to Jackson and he is all Dirty Harry with his rough sex , breaking the rules and drinking vodka straight out of the bottle , but he is a very unconvincing hard man as he runs a mile when he is confronted by Carter and is beaten up very easily by a man who is half his size , so you start to care less about his ' mission ' . maybe this was the directors intention , for us to root for the bad guy and hope the good guy gets killed , but as i have said before , i was very un-interested by the time the film had gone past the hour mark . a waste of time , and not as shocking or as sick as you may have been led to believe . avoid like McDonalds ' burgers '

Jones , but really there isn't one exciting scene in the whole movie . Li is wasted in a thankless role , and heaven knows why he chose to fight fairly in the climax , when in the opening prologue he was a bit of a rogue ( maybr it was to do with the lack of facial hair . all in all the script is poor , and one feels that this film was horribly rushed for a summer release . and don't even get me started on ' thespian ' john hannah . i'll take circus over this anyday . poor .

Seagal just mopes about in his long coat from his box office hit days helping people and killing the infected . it's gory o be fair , but it's just not a Seagal filmthe acting is dire and the editing is very poor too ( not as bad as Kill switch , but not far off ) . it's probably his worst film since attack force , and thats saying something . just erase this from your memory and pray he makes something average again .

Skarsgard sounds like he is doing his best Batman impersonation and George just hangs around the film looking grumpy . the only person in my opinion to come out of this with any dignity is Ashley waters , because he actually looks like hes making an effort . a ' waz'te of time . but that's my opinion . . .

Robert De Niro knows the answer . after the terrible reviews of this film , i decided to give it a chance , due t it's stellar cast . De Niro always appeals to me and Kinnear and Stamos have their charm too . but with such a potentially good story , comes Hamm-fisted directing , poor editing , baffling narrative and a cop out of an ending . watching the film is somewhat of an ordeal , and i found myself in places thinking to myself ' oh , he's having another dream again , i bet he walks somewhere desolate and Greg Kinnear will look concerned ' . the cast have no chemistry between them and spend the time talking really loud to each other and coming up with silly ideas whilst , working , driving , or jogging . by no means as bad as the reviews state , but it is still bad and for a ' horror ' not in the least bit scary . watch and feel depressed about the potential this film had .

Reynolds does his best with the material he is given , using his all too familiar Chevy Chase routine , but this time with a paedophile edge , it soon grates . Long is basically reprising his role from dodgeball , and soon becomes lost in the mix . Faris is amiable enough , but maybe that is because she is hardly in the movie . the rest of the cast are just pure filler , with the second rate Jay and Silent Bob in the form of some wannabe teenage gangsters and the rest of the characters are filled with oddball un-funny stereotypes . the only person to come unscathed from this debacle is Luis Guzman , who is quite funny , but given very little screen time . the editing is poor , narration shoddy at best , and the whole film finishes with a whimper . the only part in this movie that deserves any recognition is toward the end , where the editing is turned into a Donnie Darko type sequence , situated around the restaurant . but this scene , cannot justify a rental . avoid .

Intent on exacting bloody revenge on the reunited English friends Murray possesses the body of a guest and turns him into a murderer . . . from the cover of this DVD you would expect the film to feature Hilton prominently . but seeing as she is the first one to buy it , it must have been a marketing ploy to get the teenage lads excited about this slasher . no originality has been put into the story , all of the cast are very annoying , so you do tend to lose sympathy for them quite rapidly after the opening credits . the first act is boring enough , with the very cheesy script and pomposity of the characters ( all upper class young adults , guffawing and drinking whiskey ) , and then the legend of the house is revealed in the second act . the main problem with the second act is that someone has turned the lights off and not bothered to tell the cameraman as for about a good twenty minutes , you have no idea what on earth is going on . a real disappointment , given that the story is quite good and had potential , but the execution is mundane and other things ( such as the soundtrack ) are dire , makes you dislike this movie from the upstart .

Bond having an orgasm ? this has to be one of the worst , overblown bond movies ever made , Brosnan appears to be making no effort at all ( apart from the opening pre credit sequence ) , because he knew , along with the rest of the cast that this would make big money , purely because it's like an anniversary edition of the series , and nothing else . i mean Madonnas in it , and she makes Grace Jones look like Kate Winslet . the story is immature and uninvolved , so the best reason to watch this , is to spot the references to every other bond film made . if you look close enough , you will find one for every Bond movie , which makes the movie a little easier to watch . what a waste for Brosnan , who was becoming quite the iconic bond , with a bit of Connery , Dalton , and Moore mixed up . there are a few good bits , but they are few and far between .

On Largo's side , the murderous femme fatale Fatima Blush and vile SPECTRE chief Blofeld . But Bond does have an ally though , Largo's girlfriend , the willowy Domino , who falls for Bond . . . . the notoriety is far superior than the film its self . after over ten years , Connery returns as bond , but with a few limitations . obviously this isn't an official bond movie so lines such as ' shaken not stirred ' and ' Bond , James Bond ' are not used fully in a sentence . a remake of ' Thunderball ' , this has all the elements os a bond movie , girls , gadgets , locations , just none of the execution . Connery is looking more like Bob Monkhouse than a suave secret agent and who has ever seen 007 in a pair of dungarees ? there is still a lot of fun to be had and the script is full of innuendo that makes you titter every now and again . the set piece with the bike is fun , as is Bonds fight with Pat Roach , but the funniest thing in this movie is the video game showdown between Largo and Bond which puts the playstation 3 to shame . obviously when playing a video game for money , you do need to have shock treatment don't you ? the soundtrack is very bad though . sounding one minute like it's coming from a porn movie , steadily going into a gameshow theme . editing in some places is atrocious , and can make the film a little sluggish . if you are a die hard Bond fan , then this needs to be in your collection , if not see it for Connerys ' pay in . average .

Tupac turns up with an obvious grudge about something , swears a lot disappears for a while and come back later and do the same . basically the film has no plot , the narrative is poor to say the least , and when you see a man sitting in a pink Cadillac listening to ' i'm too sexy ' by right said Fred ' you know you are in trouble . but it's worth watching just for the randomness of the film

DMX is as wooden as a forest , but serves justice to his character . Arquette looks like he's just waiting for ' scream 4 ' to come along and plays the ' dewey ' role nicely . all other characters are pure filler and stereotyped , but the on standout is Micheal Ealy as Mike , who really stands out in this film and with whom much of the story is based around . not the best film out there , and with a very nasty central character , which leaves very little empathy for the rest of the characters . just about worth the one watch .

And by the law of the sea , any vessel discovered on international waters can be claimed by whomever is fortunate enough to find her and skilled enough to haul her back to port . But once on board the eerie , cavernous ship , the crew of the Arctic Warrior discovers that the decaying vessel is anything but deserted . It's home to something more deadly and horrific than anything they've encountered in all their years at sea . . . another totally scare free , but amiable horror from Zemeckis and Silver , but they have done something very special for the opening sequence , this alone deserves to be seen . but when a film has such a great opening , it has to keep up with the flow , and this doesn't unfortunately . for such a ' childish ' film , it manages to get quite a good clich√©d group of characters together , but as always , you can pretty much guess who is going to die , and who will survive . the ship itself isn't particularly anything great , and i was expecting something a little more lavish ala ' house on the haunted hill , but it has it's fair share of dark corridors . but what the makers of the film should have elaborated on more , was the back-story , that we see in flashback toward the end , as this looks like it could have been a great stand alone movie , but instead it goes for the sailors in peril method . not a bad film by no means , but nothing special .

Morgan Adams is a female pirate who is given a piece of a treasure map by her dying father . there are two other pieces held by two of Morgans ' uncles , but one of them holds a grudge and will stop at nothing to get the maps and keep the treasure that is on Cutthroat island for himself . so it is a race against time for Morgan and her crew to get all pieces of the map , find the treasure , and stay alive ! ! you can tell by the fantastic sets , lavish costume design and gorgeous locations , that Renny Harlin spared no expense on this movie . its just a shame that he didn't spend more time on the script and the actors . Davis and Modine are good enough at what they are doing , but you could not care less for their cause . and when you find both leads irritating after a very short while , you know you are in trouble . i personally cared for Langellas ' character more as he was the only one who appeared to have a little depth in his role and steal every scene he was in . also with being at one time a major contender for a blockbuster , watching it can become tiresome and the story and script are very very bad . for a pirate movie , it never really delves into the legends of pirates , for an action adventure movie , it rarely is exciting , despite the marvellous set pieces and you can tell that no expense was there . but that too is another big problem , the set pieces are boring and too long . when one gets interesting , for example the escape from the island at the beginning of the second act , it just goes on and on and on and becomes dull . there is also some tragic use of cgi in some points during the film , but then contradicting myself it has the single best use of cgi i have ever seen in use in the nineties . so not a bad film , it would have been so much better if there were different leads and the script was rewritten and it wasn't so boring at times . watch it for it's beautiful sets and production values , but don't be surprised at why it bombed so hugely .

In the meantime , Donna has invited her backup singers , Rosie and Tanya . . . i had no intentions of seeing this movie , and the fact that Firth , Brosnan and Skarsgard , were all singing , did not appeal to me in the slightest . the synopsis is vomit inducing , and the whole air of the proceedings wreaked of ' cheese ' and ' ham ' . so i'm asking myself , why oh why did i enjoy the damned thing so much ? it's a colourful romp , with plenty of laughs and some one in the film that everyone could relate to , and funnily enough the story is quite endearing too . as is the singing . fair enough , not everyone will have a future in the pop industry ( Mr . Brosnan please stand up ) , but it all goes along in such a bright and breezy manner , that you will find it hard to stop your feet tapping , even if you are not a fan of ABBA . the sets are not the best , and some of the editing could be improved , but all in all , this is a very god musical , the second best of the year in fact .

Arnie plays John Kruger , a government agent who helps people in trouble disappear for good , ' erasing ' them from existence . basically this service is for people who are in a witness protection programme , and then disobey orders from the government and are spotted from the people they are trying to avoid . Vanessa Williams plays lee Cullen , a women who has been poached by the feds to get access to some new top of the range arsenal , that should not exist and could fall into the wrong hands . lee is uncovered and obviously it is only up to Arnie to save the day , but something is not right and john and lee soon find themselves at the centre of one of the biggest cover ups the government has ever done . this harks back to the Arnie of the late eighties , pure action one liners and tongue firmly in cheek . from the word go you know that this isn't the watered down Arnie we saw in last action hero and true lies ( both good films though ) but this is Arnie back in total recall mode . James caan hams it up too as the villain and he really is a sadistic one too . but he and Schwarzenegger have great chemistry and when they share the screen , the movie is solid gold . also Robert pastorelli provides some comic relief , and bounces off Schwarzenegger's deadpan delivering of his one liners . some of the set pieces are amazing the first set piece is good which sets up the story for Schwarzenegger's character and what he does , and also the final set piece in which Arnie uses the guns to their full effect against the bad guys . but the best one is the plane sequence with Arnie being faced with being smacked head on by a speeding plane ! the only problem with the film is Vanessa Williams who at times is a little too wooden and never really seems to be in too much peril . plus the cgi is a little bad at times , this being an Arnie film , you would expect high quality ( the crocs are the worst ) but still , this movie proved that Arnie still had what it takes when it came to summer blockbusters and still knew how to push the right action buttons

Whitney and Drummy take Father Joe and Mulder to the kidnapped Banan's home , where the former priest overcomes the others ' scepticism when , in anguish and on his knees in pain , he begins bleeding from the eyes . . this has to be the most unnecessary film ever made . it feels like an extended episode of the series , and one of the average ones at that . the first movie was mediocre , but this pushes the boundaries a little too far . yes it's great to see Mulder and Scully back in action and the chemistry is still there , it's just a shame that they have been given such a shoddy story to appear in a film together . it becomes very mundane at times , but on the plus side , the settings and locales are tremendous .

Seagal plays john ( original name ) , a shady pilot , who knows a lot of things people would rather him not know , thats why at the beginning , we see him nearly getting his mind erased . instead of letting them do that ( he would forget attack force and black dawn ) , he escapes , only to get captured at a caf√© ' after defending himself . he agrees to fly out to Afghanistan to recover a stolen aircraft and two nuclear weapons , with which the owner intends dispersing on to European and American soil . . . . seeing as Seagal produced this and wrote the Screenply , there is really no excuse for him to use a voice double this time , this would have been marked up one , but the voice over always appears in his films now , it's become a part of his movies , so unfortunately , it's now expected . secondly , why does Seagal have to use a stunt double for doing the simplest of things ? laying on top of a truck , turning round to put a gun in his pocket , running ? but the action does come thick and fast and Seagal does finally have a decent fight in a film , and spend the rest of the time throwing knives into peoples throats , finally Seagal is getting back into fighting spirit . but my main concern is how lazily the film was made . nearly all of the flight footage is used from other material and it is painfully obvious to watch , and when the final third contains a dogfight , you're in trouble . even the explosions on the ground are stock footage , so when a film like this costs over 12 million , you are sitting there wondering where all the money has gone . support is fine , but if you live in Engalnd , you will notice the majority as they have all been in the bill , casualty , itv crime dramas , at one time or another . but Seagal does look like he's coming back to form , while no the greatest film on earth , it will satisfy Seagal fans , after a slew of bombs he has made .

Michael Dudikoff shows what an awesome actor he is by standing silent for about ten minutes in the opening scene of this cult classic , showing that maybe he is the James Dean of ninja . it's throwaway stuff , but funny . with ninjas with lasers and all sorts of accessories , the vanishing powder is especially unique . there is a story in there somewhere , about some missiles being stole or something , but that goes out of the window when there is a back flip or a shiruken thrown ( the sound effects guys most have worked overtime in this film ! ) instantly forgettable , it's pure Cannon cheese and it wears it proudly on its sleeve , watch it ans remember the eighties .

The film is set in winter which gives it a more claustrophobic feeling to it because even though the movie is set at night you still get that surreal blue light you get from snow which defined the mood of the film for me . You get the usual twists and plot Revelations which come as standard in most Hollywood movies now but do not let that put you off , just sit back and enjoy a thriller like they used to make , it will not disappoint .

Danny has had counselling for this problem , as the media nicknamed Danny ' the hero ' after capturing Moon . the only problem is that Danny really didn't do much to catch Moon , he just knocked himself out on a ladder step . But now Moon has escaped the mental institution he is being held at ( using dental floss , a chap-stick , and some sediment ) , and is back on the rampage , killing young girls by holding their head and making them look to the left very quickly . but now Danny is in between a rock and a hard place as the mayor of L . A wants people to think that Moon died during his escape as the last time Moon was killing , there were copycat murders . so Danny lies to the press and has to face hi demons once again . . . . . . in a typical late eighties thriller ( very darkly shot with grim murders and seemingly invincible villain ( much like the same years ' dead pool ' ) , Norris headlines this very dark and sometimes tense little film . as usual Norris isn't very good , but in this film we get several different Norris persona's eg . comedy Norris ( he faints when his wife goes into labour ) scared Norris ( he wakes up sweating after a nightmare ) sad Norris ( when finding that Moon made Steve James ' character look to the left very quickly ) reminiscing Norris ( when walking along the beach in a blue tracksuit ) and straining Norris ( when he is weight training ) . but with these persona's , he always has one facial expression . but i like his films anyway , and i expect this of Norris . but what makes this film so tense is Jack o ' Halloran as Moon . He gives the film the sense of unease and tension it deserves and even gives Norris a run for his money . It's just a shame that they writers didn't add a little depth to the character because he is basically a carbon copy of nearly every serial killer to come from that decade ( think of the killer in Cobra and you are pretty much there ) . supporting cast are average , and the romantic sub-plot with Norris is cringe inducing . but if you like Norris , it's a good movie .

They all have their own problems , such as finance , harassment , personal safety , and self doubt . Additionally , campus life seems to be causing a problem for everyone : racism . Students , already under pressure to perform in the classroom , on the track , or in front of their friends , are strained to the breaking point by prejudice , inexperience , and misunderstanding . . Singletons second film after the phenomenal ' Boyz n the hood ' is still quite an achievement , but gives its anti-race message as subtle as a sledge hammer . the stereo types here are rife , as Cubes character Fudge points out in the first act . the Nazis in this film are proper evil people as one would expect , and the Agrican Americans portrayed are pretty much the same people you would bump into in Singletons debut . but the film holds itself together due to the fantastic cast and the cinematography . but again one of it's main flaws is that there are too many characters that get you involved . Fishburne is way underused and is just there really to justify why we should ' work for ourself and not someone else ' as does Fudge but with a little more ' attitude ' . Swansons character is also underused , as is her story , as it remains one of the most interesting in the whole movie . an interesting movie , but it does have its flaws .

Cuba does okay in his role , and even though Liottas paunch out acts most of the cast , he is great in his extended cameo . but hands up to Kim Coates , one of those actors whom when you see him , your like , where have i seen him before ? and he does a good job in his role . all in all this is one of Cubas better straight to DVD movies , and even though it borrows from a lot of movies , and Ben Cross is wasted , it's worth your time .

Detective Sherman , from a district outside Manhattan , joins Frank when a second victim is killed in the same MO . They find that both victims have written poetry in the lonely hearts column of the single magazine " New York Weekly " . When there is a third case , Frank convinces his chief to write for the magazine and work undercover investigating the women that reply the advertisement . Frank falls in love for the prime suspect , the manager of a shoe store Helen Cruger , jeopardising his investigation . a return to form for Pacino after a four year absence from the big screen . the film is a by the numbers thriller , but due to the performances from the central characters and the good narrative , it's a little bit more enjoyable . the story is nothing to write home about and the revelation of the killer is quite obvious , but Pacino proves in his hey day , he could make a film work , if he put his all into it . with good support from Barkin and Goodman , it won't go down in history as the best thriller out there , but it's worth watching .

Zaysen is just a carbon copy of Berkoffs ' villain in the last movie , and one cannot help to notice that Stallone looks a little bored at moments . there are some moments of genius , the stick fight at the beginning is hilarious , as is the interrogation of Trautman , oh and the scene where Rambo sets fire to himself via first aid . but this is all brawn and no brains , a typicalfriday night action movie , that will be remembered as the first real flop that Stallone starred in . at the time , it was the biggest flop of all time and was ridiculed by various critics ( even the movie ' twins ' mocks this ) . but this movie still is fun and is never boring , lets hope that the fourth outing is a little bit more special .

Jake befriends Jamie's girlfriend Keri Johnson , takes Jamie's sweet brother Bill under his wing and manages what sheriff Loomis couldn't : eliminate Packard's criminal gang the hard way . . Wanted to see this movie for a very long time , but never had the chance , and what a movie ! it's an epitome to the eighties : great soundtrack , bad hair , bad clothes , and a sheriff who loves sugar in his coffee . the diet of the cast is only burgers , because it seems that the beach and burgers is all they have to do of a summers day . no wonder there's a wraith about . the plot is funny , and the script is bad , but we are talking about low budget eighties movies here ! in an era of Chuck , Bronson , Lundgren , and Reagan , this is just a guilty pleasure . the special effects are poor in some places , very poor in the final third , but the bad guys are a cross between something out of the warriors and escape from new york , and Randy Quaid could have been a sheriff in about four or five different movies at the time and we would have not have noticed . Sheen surprisingly isn't in the film as much as i would have hoped , but is good nevertheless . if you like your film with good car chases , explosions , sunny locations and silly bad guys , then this is for you . . .

Vaughn is Vaughn in this movie , the same arrogant persona he has played in every film since his performance in Psycho 98 ' . but for once it works well in this film and at times is justified , because no one is showing empathy toward him , just like in any real break-up . and with an ending that for once isn't sugar coated Hollywood trash , the break-up starts as your average stale frat-pack comedy , but finishes very different and makes the film better for it .

The nineteen years old Catholic college girl Emily Rose dies a couple of days after being submitted to an exorcism carried out by her parish priest , Father Moore . Emily believed she was possessed by six demons , and although authorised by Emily and he parents , Father Moore is accused of negligent homicide , since he had suggested Emily to interrupt the use of medications for epilepsy . In order to avoid a scandal , the Archdiocese hires the successful , ambitious and agnostic lawyer Erin Bruner , and the prosecution assigns the religious prosecutor Ethan Thomas . Along the days , there is a battle between science and religion in the court . . . . the trailers made this out to be quite a hard core horror movie , and any movie that has any influence to the world of exorcism , can be quite ' special to some horror aficionados since the release of ' that ' film in 1973 . but the majority of the film is placed in court , and it is quite interesting to see the story viewed from both sides , from the sceptics to the believers . all of the cast are fine , even if Tom Wilkinsons accent is a bit dodgy at times , he portrays Moore with great ease and brings a lot of ' soul to the character . Carpenter too is good in the titular , but then again , she doesn't have much else to do than look scared , angry , and perplexed . a horror film with a difference , but with some very good chills in the flashback sequences , but sometimes it just seems to be too clever for it's own good .

Going from worst to first , the team makes it to state , and Jim is forced to live up to his end of the deal . While there prove to be a lot of pitches to be thrown before he makes it off the mound , big - league dreams are revived , and there's no telling where he could go . . . Another feel good sports film inspired by a true story ( is this some kind of sub-genre ? ) that is actually very good and hits all the right notes in the right places . coming from the UK , i obviously have no idea what all the fuss is about baseball and have no idea how to play it , but it's an American institution and i respect that . Disney help the British out a lot during the games , by playing feel-good music , which indicates that the team Quaid is coaching / playing for are winning , so it helps the film keep at a pace . as usual in these films , there is one parent who doesn't give a hoot but makes amends come the end and everything is hunky dory , don't get me wrong , this is a good thing in these kinds of movies . the performances are good and the editing and narrative are spot on too , and Quaid , is as reliable as ever . worth seeing , but films like this are overlooked here in the UK , which is a shame .

Pete is also having an affair with the first lady , and when he is delivered pictures of the two ' having a scene of sensuality ' , he falls into the middle of an assassination attempt on the president which involves a mole in the white house . there has never been a traitor in the secret service until now , and Pete is the prime suspect . now on the run , he is being pursued by two federal investigators , he must clear his name and thwart the attempt on the presidents life at the same time . . . a great premise that has been done hundreds of times , you cannot help but compare this piece to the far superior ' in the line of fire ' from 1993 . in that film the main character had been involved in a real presidential assassination and was in the centre of the conspiracy . but that film had tension , used it's locations to great effect and was ' exciting ' all throughout . this film is executed well , but i'm afraid that it never really gets going until halfway through the final act . Douglas is fine in his role , but it seems that he is just a little too old to be convincing as a secret service agent , someone who could outrun people twice his age , have an affair with Kim Basinger , and also be accused of sleeping with Kiefer Sutherlands wife . Sutherland is just doing Jack Bauer , and you cannot help but compare him to his t . v role , but that isn't saying that he isn't good . Sutherland could do this sort of thing with his eyes closed and is the best thing about this movie . the other support are pure filler and just make Douglas and Sutherland look great . even Longoria is wasted in such a poor role . but the final twenty minutes are breathtaking , there are no big surprises and the ending is predictable , but the it just is essentially a great finale and is up there with any tense scene from 24 . my only problem is the choice of actor who played the president . i could not take it seriously because the president was played by sledgehammer ! and therefore the film lost a touch of tension for me . overall another vanity project for Douglas after ' the in-laws ' , but it is entertaining and interesting enough to hold your attention . what would have made better for me is that if Douglas and Sutherland switched roles . then the film would have been more believablebut try watching it without thinking of 24 or ' in the line of fire ' and your a better man than me .

Others , such as TV hostess Nathalie Lake , Land's spiritualist wife Barbara , and the Southern - like Norris family , are excited , and some , like Dale's wife , Marsha , and daughter , Taffy , don't care . Richie Norris is extremely intelligent but is only respected by his insane grandmother , while his older brother Billy is favoured for joining the army . General Decker doesn't trust the Martians and insist they fight , but General Casey is more optimistic . The Martians appear to come in peace but suddenly begin to use their super-powerful and technologically advanced weapons to wipe out the population and great structures . Soon , they attack Las Vegas , where the Norrises are living , where former heavyweight champion Byron Williams is visiting , where an obnoxious lawyer is gambling , and where Tom Jones is performing in concerts . . . this film is unfairly overlooked in my opinion , probably due to the fact that it was released so soon after independence day , so audiences probably had their fill of alien movies for a while . but this movie has a wicked sense of humour and has one of the best casts a movie has seen in a while . Burton has made a stupendous movie , which could be classed as anarchic or genius , depending what mood your in , but it's never dull , and can be disturbing at times ( tom Jones acting ? ) if you have not seen this movie , please do , it's funny , eccentric and most of all chaotic , much more memorable than independence day . .

Ben is a very real everyday guy who gets with , what some people would class as someone ' untouchable ' . he got the girl of his dreams pregnant and this is what makes the story so good and the comedy element so brilliant . but don't expect the humour to come thick and fat like some of the reviews say . this is more of the 21st century ' when harry met sally ' rather than the comedy advertised , another case of great marketing . but it still is a very good film . there are some hilarious lines , typical from Apatow , who uses the same play on words between the male friends like he did in the 40 year old virgin . with quite a touching ( if slightly jaw dropping ) final act , the film is the perfect date movie , and if you are watching this with someone you have been with for a while , don't be surprised if they are not a little broody after seeing this . Apatow has ' concieved ' another great feel-good movie .

However , if they'd known that Holly McClane was on a flight home to the very airport they were hijacking , they would have picked another day . . . . the second in the die hard movies has all the elements that made the first film work so well . a perilous situation , the jobsworth cop who won't help the hero , Al Powell , the wife in danger , and of course John McClane and a barrel of one liners . the only thing that this movie is missing is a decent villain . okay , Stuart , is ruthless and can give McClane a run for his money , but after the fantastic turn by Rickman in the original , Stuart doesn't hold a candle to him . but the set pieces are there , and there are some really standout moments in the film . the snow-ski chasethe final fight on the wing of the planeMcClane ejecting himself from an exploding plane . but it just all feels a little bit empty . Willis again is amazing as McClane all jokes and guns blazing , and is supported well by Atherton , Bedelia , Amos , Nero , Franz , and of course the mighty Atherton returns as Thornburg , who adds a little light relief . it is also fun to spot the up and coming stars such as Patrick , Leguizamo and Meaney among others . the direction is a little lame and considering that it was helmed by Harlin , it's easy to understand . but it's still a great movie and a great entry into the franchise . well worth seeing .

Gruffand and Alba share most of their scenes together and have amicable chemistry . on the other hand , Chilkis and Evans share most of their scenes together but have fantastic chemistry , always trying to get one up-manship on each other , they are the perfect foil to the seriousness of the the other two leads . MacMahon is great as Doom and shows great quality in playing the bad guy ( for once a bad guy who is more attractive than the lead , something very refreshing ) . the story is very simple , and makes it easier for family viewing . the sets are very bright and are perfect for the ' summer blockbuster ' title . set pieces are handled well and come thick and fast in the movies slim running time . having not read the source material though , it is hard to compare the faithfulness to the comic book , but the titular characters have enough of their own screen time to develop their own sub-plots . some are sad , others are fun , but all are interesting . a great family movie , with something for everyone to enjoy .

OK , sometimes the script isn't up to much , and characters who are regularly in the series ( such as Duke ) are pushed to the side , but Stallone knows how to pull the audiences heart strings . the rest of the cast are good , but this is a really good film in the series and unfairly treated when first released .

One day a man appears on her monitor , a man she thought she would never see again , a man she never wanted to see again . Now she has no choice , she is compelled to confront him . . . this film had me guessing the main protagonists vendetta against the man from the very beginning . in fact the majority of the film is so cloak and dagger , you wonder just what Jackie has gone through prior to the films opening . she seems lonely , and outcast , like she has done something wrong to her family , or was she abused ? then one day at work she sees the image of a man that begins to make her obsessed about him . for no reason , she starts to follow him and become more and more involved with his friends and his surroundings , when she does finally meet him and talk to him , she runs and goes back to the comfort of her cctv safety . the story takes a very macabre turn , and the film feels very claustrophobic at times due to the camera work and the use of the cctv . grittily filmed and sort of depressing , red road keeps the film very simple , but always has an unnerving feel to it . the cast are all very good in their respective roles , but this isn't for everyone , showing the true power that big brother has on society today . .
538814	3717154	424136	8.0	i'm every little girl you ever looked at . . . .	Jeff is a paedophile who surfs the net looking for young girls to chat to . he meets Hayley on the net and arranges a meeting with her . they meet and find out they have a lot in common . they go back to Jeffs house and start to drink and tease each other . but Hayley has a dark vendetta and after her warning ' you should never have a drink what somebody else has mixed ' , Jeff wakes up from his drug induced coma , and the nightmare really begins for him . Hayley believes that Jeff has done this before and possibly abused and murdered a teenage girl . so she starts to exact revenge on Jeff by doing the most unthinkable things a fourteen year old girl could do . but then again , paedophiles do the most unthinkable things imaginable , so poetic justice there for you . from the start , the movie has a very unsettling ambiance to it . there is nothing much of a soundtrack , and that adds to the tension . the two leads are fantastic and credit to Ellen Paige for dealing with such a difficult character with ease . the most unsettling thing about this movie is that about halfway through , you do start ( reluctantly ) to feel a little sympathy for Jeff . and you also start to feel a little hatred toward Hayley , as she is very sadistic toward Jeff . but put yourself in Hayleys shoes . how would you react to a paedophile , when you were in a room and there was no way that anyone would hear what you were doing ? the dialogue is excellent as is the cinematography , which gives a little eeriness to the proceedings . there were a few scenes i had to skip through as they were a little bit too disturbing , but overall the film is very gripping and disturbing , and deals with the subject matter very well . a film that will question your morals and make you think a little bit about the world around you . very disturbing viewing , the director mirrors the ' ear cutting ' scene in reservoir dogs , meaning that the violent deed is done off the screen so the viewer is not subject to the incident , which makes it all the more powerful .
538130	3717154	185431	8.0	good luck with the nipple rubbing . . .	Little Nicky is " daddy's little girl " in Hell . He's the son of Satan , who got the job from HIS father , Lucifer . Satan wants to retire , but none of his sons are good enough for the job . There's Cassius , who's big and strong , but lacks the ' goodness ' to make the job real . There's Adrian , who while really hot ( no pun intended ) and smart , has no goodness at all . Then there's Nicky who , while having good , lacks any evil whatsoever . He needs to release it to save his dad . Cassius and Adrain leave Hell , thereby freezing the wall of fire that lets the damned souls into Hell . Since no souls can come in now , Satan starts to die . It's up to Little Nicky to go and get his brothers , putting them into a flask and bringing them back to Hell at the exact same time to save Satan from decomposition . If Nicky ' dies ' on Earth , he will be able to get through the frozen wall and back up to Earth . The catch is that he has only a week , and that Adrian and Cassius are MUCH more powerful than he is . . . . whoever came up with the idea for this movie , really deserves a big slap on the back for writing one of the most bizarre comedies released in a long time . the plot is just an excuse for Sandler to play it a little straight for once and concentrate on observational gags and references from his other movies . it's like a Happy Madison love in . it's stupid , immature and one ' hell ' of a funny movie . i can understand why not many people like this movie , because there is no real flow to the film , it feels more like a sketch show , rather than a feature . but any movie that has Hitler dressed up as a maid and having a pineapple shoved up his ass , is a winner in my book . Maybe Cruise should have tried that in Valkyrie . . .
539054	3717154	443676	8.0	if i press any harder , it's gonna break !	in the same vein of the first movie , a boxer with problems is framed for trying to smuggle drugs out of Russia . the fact of the matter is , he is set up by the ' Mob ' so he can fight some bloke whose speaks with a great Russian accent , prays before he fights , and has a trainer who looks a little like a fat Paul Giammati . so a deal comes into the film , if he fights this guy , he will walk away from Jail , with a hefty wad of cash . but obviously things don't go according to plan and things start to get difficult for the Iceman . . . . in a world of Scorcese , Fellini , Ttuffaut and Lynch , its nice once in a while to watch a pure unadulterated stupidly entertaining movie that wants nothing from the viewer but just for them to enjoy the fights and the implausible plot . this kind of film has not been made in a long time , it reminds me of Bloodsport in some ways and kickboxer in others , the fights are brutal and balletic in some crazy way , and the supporting characters are just your stereotypical movie filler . all the boxes for prison / action movie have been ticked . the friendly room matethe opponent who can break apparatus with a single blowthe knowledgeable old man who lives in the basementthe angry flashback before the final roundand the ' Spartacus ' scene . it's all pure fluff , but the film is short and exciting and sometimes quite amusing . plus we get the most hilarious editing toward the end .
538961	3717154	373889	8.0	there's a storm coming Harry . . .	As another year begins for Harry , at Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry so does the never-ending articles stating that he and Dumbledore are insane . As the ministry starts to invent new and malicious lies about Harry's account on Voldemort's return , Hogwarts begins to change for the worse as the ministry sends in their cure for all the insanity , Professor Dolores Jane Umbridge . As she begins to inflict her rules and regulations on the students at Hogwarts they begin to find that with her as their teacher , they'll never be ready for the outside world . So Harry along with his friends decides to take things into their own hands and begin to learn magic the real way . As Harry starts having visions of terrible events happening with the Ministries very walls he decides to take action , leading himself and his friends into battle , ultimately teaching them what friendship , loyalty and sacrifice really means . . . having never read any of the books and relying on the films purely for narration , i have no opinion on characters that are missing and that are added . what my opinion is though is that the film is a very enjoyable fifth year at hogwarts , and Harry and the films are progressively getting maturer and darker as the years go by . Radcliffe as always is the centre of attention , but this time it seems that fellow cast members such as Grint and Watson have less screen time in order for the Potter / Voldemort plot line to span out . maybe in the book , they have more to do . Staunton is very impressive as the spanner in the works and brings some sinister comic relief to the film . other players such as Rickman , Smith , Coltrane , Gleeson , Thewlis , and Thompson are sidelined to just barely more than cameos and the film just needs them to be in it . the main concern of the film though is the under use of Oldman as Black , as he was one of the main connections between him and Voldemort , and his demise unfortunately holds no emotional impact , as probably the book did . but the final twenty or so minutes is enthralling and the set piece reminds one of the lobby sequence in the Matrix , and the battle between Yoda and dooku in episode 2 ( set up , not references ) . but Feinnes steals the show as the on who cannot be named , and is truly menacing for the few minutes he has on screen . for a Potter movie this has to be one of the best , and very dark , especially toward the end . worth seeing . . .
539090	3717154	414852	8.0	Taha left us a package .	District 13 is a ghetto in Paris where it is lawless and the streets are ran by the thugs and a kingpin known as Taha . for no reason at all , Leito has a suitcase full of drugs that belong to Taha , and he and his henchman want it back . instead of giving it back though , Leito empties it down the bath tub , and escapes the henchmen using the medium of parkou , which is frankly , amazing . in fury , Taha kidnaps his sister , Loaa , and just when he thinks he has the upper hand , Leito is double crossed by the cops . meanwhile , the tall twin out of ' kiss of the dragon ' plays a cop who is undercover as a right hand man for a big time criminal and arrests him . whilst holding his own from his henchman using the medium of martial arts . when a nuclear weapon falls into the hands of Taha , the pair team up to find the bomb before it explodes and find lola . this movie is just one long excuse to show off parkour fused with martial arts in a sort of ' run lola run ' meets ' escape from new york ' hybrid . and boy , is this film fun . Besson really lets rip with the stupendous plot , just like he did with ' taxi , ' kiss of the dragon ' and ' the transporter ' . if you are fans of the above mentioned film then you know what just to expect . great narrative , fast pacing and a great slender running time . there are few problems , the soundtrack repeats itself when some of the more intense action scenes are shown , and the bad guys are very stereotypical for this kind of movie . but this is an action film film that is very simplistic , very well done and most important of all , very exciting .

Wealthy media tycoon William Parrish leads a charmed existence until Death comes calling with an extraordinary proposition - he'll delay Bill's imminent demise in exchange for a tour of life . Innocent , enigmatic and often hilarious , Joe disrupts Bill's world of privilege and corporate intrigue . But when he falls for Bill's beautiful daughter , Joe threatens to change the rules . Now Bill must fight not for his future , but for those he loves . . anybody thinking that Brad Pitt as death in the remake of ' death takes a holiday ' would be right to give a big gulp at the prospect . not only does Pitt bring an almost innocent performance in his role , he is endlessly watchable in this bittersweet tale . ably supported by Hopkins and a career best performance from Forlani , the film does drag in several places and their is a pointless but poignant sub-plot involving Pitt and an amazing island accent . Even at it's epic running time , the film never really ails , with Hopkins becoming stronger in character as he ever reaches nearer to his date with destiny . sloppy for some , but for those who like a good old fashioned romantic drama , this is a lot better than some of the slop Hollywood is dishing out now .

This is the true story of John McLoughlin and William J . Jimeno , two of the last survivors extracted from Ground Zero and the rescuers who never gave up . . . when Hollywood first heard that Oliver stone was to make a movie about the events of , they must have nearly had a heart attack , what with him and his conspiracy theories . but what Stone delivers here is not a story about the conspiracies ( the word terrorist is not even used in the film ) , but it is a story about love , friendship , courage , and the ability of a city to come together after such a tragedy . the cast are fantastic and all put in great performances and by reading about the history of the movie , all put in a lot of time and effort into this project . the sets are stunning and there are some very intense scenes , but cage ( who is usually a very animated actor ) is very constraint and handles the character well . obviously this film will be upsetting for some people ( the initial collapse of the building really is shocking ) and could offend others , but this is Stone at his most constrained and shows great respect for the event . recommended

After a chase , thinking that they killed Scott in a truck crash , Veronica takes Devreux home to his parents in Louisiana , only to have Scott catch up with them for a brutal confrontation . . probably Van Dammes most famous film ever to hit the big screen thanks to the presence of Lundgren . to us action fans this could be compared to the Pacino / De Niro team up of ' heat ' three years later . the story is great and highly original ( although comparisons to the terminator are there ) and the action is more or less non-stop through the slim running time , Van Damme plays himself as usual , but this time a little more tongue in cheek , but is supported greatly by Lundgren . he is clearly having a ball playing the bad guy and commands every scene that he is in . all the set pieces are very well edited and entertaining and the rest of the support is amiable . it would have been good to get a bit more back story on the unisol programme , but i fear that this would have hindered the movies pace . a cracking action / sci-fi , showing Van Dammes and Lundgrens once strong star statusare we having fun yet ? ?

His cell-mate John Smith that was sentenced to life revenging the death of his family befriends Wade and gives helpful advices and hope to Wade to return to his family . . what a really good movie this is ! i honestly was not expecting much while reading the credits ' And Val Kilmer ' it doesn't really get your pulse pumping ( no offence Val ) but i was surprised at the excellent writing , performances from Kilmer , Dorff and Perrin . . . that bloke from Matrix reloaded , and the taut running time , that made this film gripping and exciting , until the very end . it never gets boring and there are some great lines of dialogue spoken by Kilmer , who is the baddest of the bad , because he wears glasses , has a beard , and gets visited by Sam Shepard a lot . the ending is a little predictable but the best performance comes from perrinaeu ( really don't know how to spell his name ) who is sadistic , and genuinely nasty throughout , watching the prisoners in glee as they beat the crap out of each other , and then being nice as pie to his colleagues out of work . all in all if you see this in the rental store and are in two minds , trust me , it's worth the risk .

Joseph gorden levitt is sensational in a role which was written for him and he should be a huge star soon . he handles his character well and shows no sign of emotion , as the emotions were taken away from him when he was younger . this movie asks questions such as what would you be like if you had no emotions when you are older . would you be called the freak ? would you be able to handle that ? or would you go off the rail and do something taboo like the characters in this film . araki chose his cast well , all concerned are exceptional and it is great to see billy drago again in a good movie , the most heartbreaking character of all . watch this film and never forget it . some people may think you are alien

Gabriel mat not be the most memorable baddie of all time but is McClanes most personal adversary . the editing is very poor , and on occasion you can actually see where they cut the profanity out , and yes , it is sacrilege to leave the last word of his famous line muffled by a gunshot , but these are minor quibbles for such a great movie . with lots of references to the original ( agent Johnson , lift shafts and broken glass to name but a few ) Due Hard 4 . 0 is one of the satisfying blockbusters this summer , and could maybe pave the way action movies are made in the future , with less CGI . a triumph

Lacking any artistic talent whatsoever , Walter has to resort to similar methods to produce new work , and soon people start mysteriously disappearing . . . at just over an hour long , this is one of the best B-movies out there . Dick Miller is fantastic at the lead , who at first doesn't realise what he did to the cat was wrong , but when he gets recognition , he aspires for bigger things . it's pretty random stuff , but the narrative is good and there are some cunning connotations and hilarious beards in the movie . deserved of it's cult status , the film is one to be seen , one of Cormans finest pieces of work .

A film director sees Rose and decides she's perfect for his next picture ; she takes a screen test . She's ecstatic and calls Lauren : jealousy takes over . . . after seeing the novelty of the four way spit screen on screen , the film becomes a piece of art and the story works very well . This could be Figgis ' best piece of work to date ( still need to see hotel ) but the genius in this is trying to find the editing . i may be wrong , but i never once saw a cut or new scene on either of the four screens . all the performances are tremendous and the film focuses mainly on the loneliness of high powered people who become paranoid and obsessed by the nature of drugs . but time code is a trippy movie indeed , it will take at least two viewings to understand all the connotations , but trust me , it's worth the second visit .

Even though in the film he's a man of very few words , Jones ' performance is heartbreaking , as we follow him on his quest to find his missing son . it appears that the man has many secrets , having a poor relationship with his wife and never really becomes emotional until the final third . he almost acts like an automaton when he hears about the demise of his son . maybe he cannot believe he has lost two children in battle or the motive of the killing , but the performance is unbearably intense and Jones has delivered an almost flawless performance . with great support from Theron , Sarandon and Patric , the writing is smoothly written , and with a film that could have been deemed very political and anti-war , it comes across a very serene beautiful piece of cinema . worth watching for Jones alone .

Director Shepherd has got a career best performance from Brosnan , a role that gives the finger to Bond . their are little moments and lines in the film that really bite into Bond , and Brosnans character is a cross between Bond and Martin Riggs . this is a man who is the human definition for the ' lonely planet ' books . this is one lonely man who is in desperate need of a friend , and in some scenes you do have a lump in your throat for him . but this can sometimes confuse the viewer . Shouldn't we be feeling empathy for Danny as he is having trouble with his job , and it's just coming up to the anniversary of his son's death ? the audience opt for the lonely alcoholic it man who is going through a breakdown . that is how good Brosnans performance is . an excellent film with real heart and a great story , this is a feel good film of the highest order , with a nasty little dark side to it . trust me .

Blofeld is fantastic , but isn't in it for very long , but Pleasence really gets the character down to a tee as he is very chilling , calm , but ruthless , and has pet piranhas ! ! it's a great bond movie , one of Connerys best and one of the most understated entries into the series . not the best place to start , but worthy of watching , once you get into the series .

Arriving at the Mendez mansion in Mexico , he is immediately surprised by the beauty and youth of Mendez ' wife Miryea . Their attraction to each other is undeniable , but Cochran is aware that Mendez is a powerful , vindictive , and very possessive man who does not tolerate betrayal . . . this the review of the ' directors cut ' which is twenty minutes shorter than Costners vision . but what we have is just not a movie of the titular mode , this is a story of betrayal , lust and quest . it's fair to point out that Quinns character is justified in his actions toward Costner and Stowe , but the film really changes when Costner recovers from a brutal beating . we meet random characters , who are intricate to Costners journey , and make the film well worth watching . this is one of Cstners and Scotts most underrated movies and it's not very easy to see why . Costner is fantastic , as are the rest of the cast , and Scott has calmed down a little with the flashy editing , but makes the viewer feel very arid throughout the movie . although the movie is violent in places it's more of a drama t han action , and the solemn ending makes it more powerful . worth seeing .

Incredibly all the situations change , emotions , love , mafia , death come back violently into Titta's life . . . . visually and aurally stunning , the consequences of love is just that , what happens when you break your routine , and when ghosts come to haunt you . forcibly living his life virtually autonomous , the lead has nothing to live for , due to a mistake he made ten years prior to the story . he is almost ghostlike , flitting in and out of peoples lives like they have no importance , but when his younger brother visits him , things start to change for him . people start to notice that he isn't noticing them , and he starts to reveal the other residents facades in rude , demeaning manners . the final third of the film is melancholy , with just enough empathy from the viewer to level out the bitterness . the acting is astonishing , relying on body language rather than an actual script , and the camera-work is some of the best ever committed to celluloid , depicting the impressions of drug use and the cold desolate life that Titto has . the soundtrack too , blasts in and out of the movie , like the people in Tittos life and in some instants , Titto resembles Bessons ' Leon in many ways . a very beautiful film , that could be compared to a piece of art .

As the world around them manifests into a literal hell-on-earth , the horrified citizens try desperately to survive this apocalyptic disaster . . the good thing about this very tense , taut , thriller is that it doesn't focus too much on the beasts that are surrounding the supermarket . what we get is an insight into what people will do to survive , whether or not their belief in faith is justified , or should it be every man for themselves ? the party in the supermarket segregate between the believers ( led by a sinister Marcia gay Harden ) and the people who want to survive ( ultimately led by Jane ) . at eleven minutes in to the film the tension really begins with a lone man running into the supermarket declaring ' they've taken John Lee ! ' and from then on it's panic stations for our various characters . Darabont knows how to write characters and how to shoot set pieces , and while this isn't up there with Shawshank and the Green Mile , it's still one of the best thrillers of the year with some cracking performances and on of the most ironic and depressing endings i have ever seen . highly recommended .

At the end of the race , he finds out he is tied with Chick Hicks and The King . On the way to the tie-breaker race in Los Angeles , California , some hot punk cars get him lost in a little town called Radiator Springs on the old Route 66 road , which has been long forgotten many years ago . Scared to death , he tears up the town's main road and is sentenced to community service by Doc Hudson . During this time , he meets tow truck Mater , and Porsche carrera Sally . All he wants to do is get out of this town and back into the big city , but as the week until the race goes on , the town folk help him discover that life isn't just about trophies , fame , and sponsorships , but a whole lot more . . . . . . . a rites of passage tale , which essentially is a make of 1991's Doc Hollywood , Cars goes along the same path as Doc Hollywood , but along the way , stops for a refill of laughs and excitement . one of Pixars most advanced films to date , the computer animated effects are astonishing , with everything given extensive detail , from the smoke coming out of the exhaust , to the reflection on the cars bumper . Wilson is the perfect choice as Mcqueen , who is never really cocky or dis likable from the start , but the towns people hate him at first anyway ! this could be Wilsons finest role to date . he is supported greatly by Newman , Keaton , Hunt , Larry the cable guy , and of course John Ratzenberger . the film is blessed this time , with a little more adult friendly humour , but a lot more action than previous Pixar outings ( i really do believe that this is aimed more at the masculine audience , but will appeal to all ) . everything turns out fine in the end , with some morals of course and some great references of past Pixar films , this studio keeps improving on their quality ( story and visuals ) of film . a great movie with lovable characters and a story and script which just oozes class . make a ' pit stop ' for this movie ! !
538098	3717154	420294	9.0	my moneys saying your not going anywhere . . . . . .	Two young men are spending a last weekend with their girlfriends before being shipped overseas to the war . At the same time in a small Texas town , the only major business goes out of business forcing the town's inhabitants to move on to greener pastures . One of the men who works in the plant is Thomas Hewitt , a deformed , demented psychopath ( who will become known as Leatherface ) . When Hewitt finds out what is happening , he savagely murders the foreman of the plant . Meanwhile , the two young men and their girlfriends are headed down a lonely highway towards the town when they are involved in an car accident that cripples their vehicle . Soon they encounter the local sheriff , who is not really the sheriff , but the homicidal Charlie Hewitt , the uncle of Leatherface who has murdered the sheriff and taken his job and police car knowing that with the town deserted , no one will notice . Uncle Charlie / Sheriff Hoyt kidnaps three of the teens and takes them to his home where he , Leatherface Hewitt , the senile Uncle Monty , and Charlie's sister , Luda Mae , reside . Charlie wants the developing monster ' Leatherface ' to " refine " his murderous abilities . The one girl , Chrissie , who escaped unnoticed attempts to rescue them with the help of a biker whose girlfriend was killed by ' Sheriff Hoyt ' . What follows is a night of sheer terror at the hands of a family of cannibalistic , inbred psychopaths . . . my only complaint about this great movie , is that there is not enough story to back up the history of leatherface ( basically this explains that he became the monster because he was fired from his job ) . but this doesn't really matter because we have a great performance from Ermey a the psychotic sheriff Hoyt , who makes leatherface look like Kenneth Williams . his story is very interesting and makes the movie worthwhile . the film is very gory , even more gory than the 2003 re-make and includes some very disturbing scenes in the household . the four teens do not do very much apart from getting tortured and screaming blue murder . inevitably , this is not a film for the squeamish , but a very important entry into the series .

We follow the investigators and reporters in this lightly fictionalised account of the true 1970's case as they search for the murderer , becoming obsessed with the case . Based on Robert Graysmith's book , the movie's focus is the lives and careers of the detectives and newspaper people . . . if Finchers movie deoesn't get us anywhere nearer to showing us the true identity of the Zodiac killer , you have to admit , that the attention to detail has to be one of the best in cinema this year . for a film that is almost three hours long , and the majority of the film is discussion between the press and between the police , the film runs at a fast pace . in typical Fincher fashion , the camera-work is very stark and the characters are layered well , with each of the four leads getting their fair share of screen time ( Downey JR steals the movie , but Ruffalo will win an academy award sometime ) . although the film concentrates more on the people who receive mail from the killer , when we do get screen time with the ' killer ' it is horrifying and the killings are very unpleasant , leaving you quite unsettled . in the final third , Fincher carries out the conspiracy theory that the main suspect may or may not have been the Zodiac , but he died later in life . when leaving the movie , you wonder whether the killer is still out there or if he died a long time ago . but the film never falters and remains interesting until the final frame , one of the best movies of the year .
539136	3717154	106308	9.0	by god , let's give em ' what for ! ! !	In the third film of " The Evil Dead " series , our gun-toting , chainsaw-handed hero , Ash , has been transported to the 13th century where he has been prophesied as the one who will find the Necronomicon , the Book of the Dead , and deliver the people from the terrors of the Deadites , who quest for the book , too . But he is mistaken as a spy from a rival kingdom and forced to fight two Deadites before the people find out what he is here for . He also falls for a woman named Sheila before he searches for the book . But after finding it , he says the wrong words that will allow the wise men to use the book to send him back and stop the Deadites and accidentally awakens the Army of the Dead , led by his clone , Evil Ash . Now , Ash must use his 20th century wits and skills to beat Evil Ash and his army of skeletons . . when i first saw this movie in the cinema back in 1993 , i was quite unaware of the evil dead phenomenon , having only seen the previous two films once . but i was still blown away by this adventure movie . viewing it though fourteen years later and it has lost some of it's appeal that made the first film such a landmark , and another reason why the viewing experience leaves you a little empty , is because you are wondering whether you are watching the version that Raimi intended the world to see . the version i saw at the cinema , had the S-mart ending , the DVD version i have ( the numbered directors cut ) is the downer ending . still , the action never lets up and the film is endlessly quotable with a crackling script . Campbell has never been better as the eponymous hero , and he makes the movie . the rest of the cast are pure filler and the film feels a little empty whenever Campbell is not on the screen . the film is never scary , but always tongue in cheek , and the only time it comes anywhere near to be in ' evil dead territory ' is the pit sequence and the running to the mill sequence . but Raimi has made a satisfactory end to the trilogy , very cheaply made with hilarious results and the final act is a cross between the three stooges and Jason and the argonauts on LSD . if you are a fan of the evil dead movies , you will lap this up , but if you only watched the original because it was banned , then you will be disappointed . try and see the version with the S-mart ending , a lot more fun and a fitting tribute to the legend that is Ash .

The boys are both infatuated with the same girl , and pass their days bickering over which of them loves her the most . Finding himself homeless , Tomo surreptitiously moves into Marek's bedroom - but it's only a matter of time before Marek's dad discovers what's going on . . . . Shane meadows does it again , with a film that is basically about nothing , just two lads meeting and fancying the same girl , but one cannot help but realise that this is one of the feel-good films of the year . the script is fresh and funny , and some scenes are just heartbreaking , but Meadows never lets up with the funny connotations , and sly visual gags that get you laughing every time . filmed in black and white , this adds to the texture of London , making it appear a cold and depressing place for our young heroes . very short , but well worth the trip to see it .
538061	3717154	460829	9.0	Nicky , you were great . . . .	A blonde actress is preparing for her biggest role yet , but when she finds herself falling for her co-star , she reallies that her life is beginning to mimic the fictional film that they're shooting . Adding to her confusion is the revelation that the current film is a remake of a doomed Polish production , 47 , which was never finished due to an unspeakable tragedy . . . another masterpiece from Lynch , which like most of his movies , is very easy to understand in your head , but is unspeakably difficult to try and explain orally . i'm not even going to try to explain my perceptions of the film , but it just blew me away . Laura Dern's performance ( s ) was fantastic and probably her best to date , and the film is typically Lynchian . what he gives us is an experimental nightmare of a movie , it can be argued that the film could ( and i mean could ) be about reflecting on ones life , the Hollywood system and how it exploits people in the industry , schizophrenia , adultery , and even time-travel . but i believe that the movie doesn't start ' proper ' until Nicky finds out that she has go the part , and the time prior to this could be a summary of what will happen to her . as said by the old woman , ' every action has a consequence ' , and in my opinion , Lynch implies that we are like spiders , we weave our own web and we have to live in it . the imagery is vivid , scary yet calming , and sometimes the film is very sexually charged . it's probably Lynch's most complicated film , but very rewarding once watched over and over . watch this and Mulholland drive , it is rewarding .

The DEA dispatches a helicopter to collect Leiter in an attempt to capture Sanchez , and Bond tags along . The pair capture Sanchez by pulling his plane out of the air with a Coast Guard helicopter , and then parachute down to arrive at the wedding on time . Later that same day , DEA agent Killifer assists Sanchez in escaping federal custody , lured by Sanchez's promise of two million dollars for whoever aids him in escaping . Leiter and his new wife , Della , are captured . In retaliation for Sanchez's capture and imprisonment , Leiter is bound and lowered into a shark tank ; the shark bites off the lower half of one of his legs . After hearing the news of Sanchez's escape , Bond returns to Leiter's house to find Della dead . Bond finds Felix , maimed but still alive , bearing a note from Sanchez : " He disagreed with something that ate him . " a furious James Bond sets out to hunt and kill those involved in his friends ' torture and mutilation . with his licence to kill revoked , bond goes it alone out for revenge , and will risk everything to get Sanchez . , , in Daltons last film as Bond , he tales all the campness of Moore and the suaveness of Connery , and throws it aside for a gritty revenge tale . hated by many bond fans and critics alike , this was a box office failure when released in 1989 ( might have had something to do with Lethal Weapon 2 and Batman being released at the same time ! ! ) but this is by far one of the most interesting bond films ever made . Dalton is flawless in his role , and gives Bond the edge he so needed in the eighties after Moores poor last two films . with some great support from Benicio Del Toro and Cary Lowell , but the film has to go to Robert Davi , whose portrayal of Sanchez oozes charm and pure evil . with great locations , great narration and story and some very violent set pieces , this is one Bond film that will stand the test of time . it's a sham Dalton only did two .
538731	3717154	118273	10.0	clarky cats . . .	all i can say is that this series and the special are a work of genius . it's out to offend as many people as possible , but no one can doubt the sheer intelligence , balls and insanity of one Morris . every episode is laugh out loud funny , and the celebs who are in this must have low IQ's because it's blatantly obvious what is going on . my favourite episode is ' drugs ' , which is endlessly watchable and laugh out loud funny every time it's viewed . the article on ' cake ' ' a made up drug ' is ingenious , and i could imagine Morris in fits of laughter whilst writing some of the alternative names for the drug . obviously it's not for the daily mail reader , or people without a broad mind . but if you can swallow sheer audacity of the show , it's a winner . every single time . one of the best programmes channel 4 has ever commissioned

Joanne is crying her eyes out and her clothing is ripped . Kelly's face is bruised and starting to swell . Duncan Allen lies in his bathroom bleeding to death . Duncan's son , Stuart , has found his father and wants answers . Derek , Kelly's pimp , needs to find Kelly or it will be him who pays . Kelly and Joanne need to get through the next 24 hours alive . . . from the the good reviews and the hype this film received on it's initial release , i was expecting a lot from London To Brighton , and it delivered the goods as promised . Wiiliams has proved to be one of the directors of the future to watch , and is even given Shane Meadows a run for his money . the outline of the film is simple , revenge . but it's the execution of the film and the bond between Kelly and Joanne that really hold it together . the fact that Kelly is so protective over Joanne shows us that she may be a prostitute , but she has maternal instincts over someone she barely knows , especially for a girl who smokes , lives rough and swears like Gordon Ramsey . Maybe Kelly can see her younger self in Joanne , and doesn't want her to end up the way she has . but it's the females who dominate the movie , as the men are basically typecast gangsters and villains , who do what they say and say what they do , but they are convincing also in their respective roles . camera-work gives a grim depiction of London , whereas films such as Notting Hill give the capital a sugar coated feel to it . this London isn't nice . it's certainly not the film to watch if you are planning a trip there . Brighton on the other hand is shown in an optimistic way at the beginning of the second act , maybe indicating that the two heroines have escaped their reality . the ending though isn't much of a surprise , but while some will be sighing with relief , one would not class the ending as happy . one of the finest British films of the decade , showing that we have talent still here and not relying on millions of dollars to get attention .
538441	3717154	85474	10.0	a work of comedy genius	Over 20 years after this was first released , this is still absolutely hilarious stuff from start to finish , no matter how many times you watch it . Finally released on DVD in Britain , the jokes never fail to raise a smile , from the cookout story , to Uncle Gus , and his drunk father talking about his house , it's still funny . but also it's one of the most politically incorrect shows i've ever seen , and the opening of Eddies performance and him talking about ' faggots ' may raise a few gasps or tuts now . but because it's wrong to laugh at this sort of stuff now , because you'd end up in court , makes it even more funnier now , than it was . much better than ' Raw ' this is Murphy at his prime , and after Beverly Hills Cop , his career peaked and it was all downhill from there . stop making kiddie friendly films Eddie , we love you saying FK ! ! ! !

On the warmest day of the year , the country estate takes on an unsettling hothouse atmosphere , stoking Briony's vivid imagination . Robbie Turner , the educated son of the family's housekeeper , carries a torch for Briony's headstrong older sister Cecilia . Cecilia , he hopes , has comparable feelings ; all it will take is one spark for this relationship to combust . When it does , Briony - - who has a crush on Robbie - - is compelled to interfere , going so far as accusing Robbie of a crime he did not commit . Cecilia and Robbie declare their love for each other , but he is arrested - - and with Briony bearing false witness , the course of three lives is changed forever . Briony continues to seek forgiveness for her childhood misdeed . Through a terrible and courageous act of imagination , she finds the path to her uncertain atonement , and to an understanding of the power of enduring love . an absolutely amazing adaptation of the novel ' Atonement ' really captures the essence of the thirties and the cinematography and narration are some of the best i have seen this year . the film explains the way we perceive things when we don't know the full story , like when you walk in on a conversation , some people get the wrong idea of the conversation , but this story makes this harrowing and unimaginable . the long shot featuring the killing of the horses and the ferris wheel whilst the soldiers walk to the bar , is every bit as amazing as the long shot seen in last years ' children of men ' . but it's the final act that is truly heartbreaking , and for people who have not read the source material , will stick with you a long time after the film has finished . a beautiful piece of work , probably one of the most lavish films of the year , it really has to be seen anyone who is love . .
538176	3717154	420291	10.0	my name is William Keane . . . . . .	Keane is a genius movie that can be interpreted in different ways . the film is about a loner who is searching for his lost daughter who was abducted from a bus station . living on his own in a motel , he claims disability and spends his time in his room drinking alcohol . when returning to his room , he overhears a woman and her child having trouble paying for their room . after giving the mother some money , they form a kind of friendship , but the mother takes advantage of Keane and leaves him no choice but to look after her daughter . they form a very close relationship , and soon after the mother announces she is leaving the motel with her daughter , leaving Keane alone again . . . . with a great performance by Lewis , Keane can be viewed view two different ways . in one sense , the story can be told as a harrowing tale of a man who has lost his daughter , through his own silly mistake and has lost everything through it and it has caused him to have mental health issues . when he befriends the mother and daughter , he instantly wants to be part of their nuclear family , as a way to make up for the loss of his kin . when he realises that there will be no Chance of this he takes the girl to the place that his daughter was abducted from , and re-enacts the events that led up to her disappearance , but does everything right this time , laying his demons to rest . viewed in another way , Keane could be delusional , having paranoid schizophrenia , spending his days making up fantasies for his own pleasure . taking the boredom out of his days , he spends his benefits on alcohol and drugs and when he meets the mother and the daughter , in his own mind , he thinks he is the saviour and that they both owe him something . but when they leave , he realises things have not gone his own way , and decides to abduct the child . because the film ends so abruptly , we are left to decide the way the film ends , and as the viewer , get the choice of how it is depicted . made in a docu-drama style , Keane is an excellent very interesting movie , that will always have a different meaning to different people . well worth watching .

His twisted agenda involves choosing seven victims who represent egregious examples of transgressions of each of the Seven Deadly Sins . He then views himself as akin to the Sword of God , handing out horrific punishment to these sinners . Two cops , an experienced veteran of the streets who is about to retire and the ambitious young homicide detective hired to replace him , team up to capture the perpetrator of these gruesome killings . Unfortunately , they too become ensnared in his diabolical plan . . . . this is one of those rare movies that when watched again will never have the same impact as it did on you the first time you saw it . darkly horrific and sometimes darkly funny , Andrew Kevin Walker has written a very ambitious and often harrowing movie . it's not horror , though the film stays with you a long time . Pitt and Freeman are excellent in their respective roles but predictably , the film is Stolen by Spacey . be it strange that he is listed as one of the most sadistic murderers ever portrayed on film , we never see him commit a crime . he is a calm , collected psycho who believes that he is doing the world a favour by ridding the world of vain , gross , and greedy people who we see every day on the street . the film is very dark , about 80 % of the film is very darkly lit , but what is surprising , come the revelation in the end , it's sunny and the sky is blue . is it connotation that it's finally over ? that Doe's ' mission ' has been completed ? the editing is some of the best i have ever seen , and their are tender moments in the film which makes the ending seem even more ' depressing ' . Kudos to Pitt and Freeman for standing their ground on the ending , because it's one of the most awe inspiring endings ever , and one that will stand the test of time . if you have not seen , this movie , and know nothing about the ending , tell no one , seek a copy , and enjoy . believe me it's worth it .
538293	3717154	386032	10.0	we swim together , we sink together . . .	Michael Moore interviews Americans who have been denied treatment by our health care insurance companies - - companies who sacrifice essential health services in order to maximise profits . The consequences for the individual subscribers range from bankruptcy to the unnecessary deaths of loved ones . A group of Americans who became ill from volunteering at Ground Zero , but were refused health coverage for their illnesses , are ferried by Moore to Cuba , where they receive the top-rate , free care one would hope they'd get here at home . In his interviews , historical reportage , and typical sarcastic wit , Moore soundly condemns American health insurance companies and pharmaceutical companies , as well as the politicians who have been paid millions to do their bidding . He makes the case that there is something wrong with Americans that we cannot learn from the successes of other countries in providing better quality-of-health than they enjoy in the USA . as a nurse in the UK , it makes me glad that we have such a good health service , despite it's flaws . compared to the USA . our patients are treated like royalty , not left to die or wander the streets as Moore observes here on several occasions . but the film is very sad and sometimes very hard to watch , and if i were American , i'd feel that Moore was rubbing my nose about health across the world a little . probably his most accessible film outside the USA , i suggest that everyone who moans about the NHS watch this film , and then eat a little bit of humble pie . a true revelation .
