Hannigan looks very embarrassed to be in this movie and should fire her agent , right now ! ! . it is not even funny in the slightest . we have been spoon fed as an audience , fart gags , boob gags , bodily fluid gags , stupid unfunny movie references , Micheal Jackson sight gags , animals using toilets gags and celebrity look a like gags for far too long , and i for one are really sick of these films now . please stop this torture now . there are not enough years in peoples lives to have time wasted on drivel like this , the eighty minutes felt like i was watching the lord of the rings trilogy and i knew this was going to be bad the minute ' hitch ' was spoofed . almost every recent successful film made is referenced in this , and some of the spoofs are as pointless as a broken pencil ( see the dodgeball spoof or the kill bill spoof ) . please if you do get to rent this film , be careful and do not tell anyone , you will be mocked . i feel totally disgusted that a film like this ever crossed my eyes and ears . shockingly bad .

When his application is refused , his mother sends him to Los Angeles to live with his sadistic cousin Angelo Buono . Kenneth unsuccessfully tries to join LAPD , and Angelo convinces him to start a prostitution business with him . They force two girls from Tucson to work for them , but their competitors destroy their business and steals their money . The frustrated Kenneth and Angelo decide to revenge against a prostitute , and Kenneth strangles her , feeling a great pleasure with her death . The two cousins become addicted in death , initially killing prostitutes and then attacking single women , dumping their bodies on the hill . . . . in the same vein as the Bundy movie a few years prior to this , comes another virtually unwatchable movie , starring an actor who should know better . i don't know whether it's the directors and writers intention to make a dirty feeling exploitation film , but you do feel disgusting after watching this . the script is poor the camera-work and editing dodgy , and the performances way over the top . again maybe intended by the filmmakers , the main protagonists are only violent toward women and appeared afraid of men , which makes you Even more angry whilst watching the movie . another bad film about a subject that should have been left well alone . for a better film about a serial killer see ' summer of Sam '
538556	3717154	479968	2.0	thats not my ring tone . . .	very intrigued about the premise of this film and i wanted to see it for several reason , Sossamans first major role in a long time , to see if Burns had got over a sound of thunder , and whether Hollywood could make another decent re-make of a Japanese horror involving phones . well the film is absolutely devoid of any chill or thrills whatsoever , and when the film makers wanted you to jump , i found myself laughing , especially at the cat grab scene . the plot is missing a decent narrative and while sossaman and Burns both deliver half decent performances , they could do this sort of stuff in their sleep . it borrows heavily from final destination and the twist at the end comes from a set piece used in the sixth sense . it's been done a thousand times before , a lot lot better , but it's just really unwatchable in places . a really bad film .

Snipes stays third in the direct to DVD championship at the moment , way behind Seagal and Van Damme , and that is saying something . for die hard Snipes fans only . . . . or sadists

Tim Allen stars in another dog of a movie . this time , he plays a reformed superhero who is lured back out of retirement by Chevy Chase and a promise of 500 , 000 dollars . he has to train the quartet of troubled teens , one who is super-strong , one who is fat and can get fatter , one who can turn invisible , and one who can move things using the mind . and Courtney Cox , who literally blows in this movie . so the movie is about finding ones self and realising that although that you are different , you are a special individual . didn't Christine Aguillera sing about this already . a very unfunny movie which relies heavily on other movies such as the incredibles and the previous years sky high . Tim Allen appears to e on auto pilot for the majority of the film and has something cocky to say to every syllable that is uttered to him , ehich is really painful considering the script is so bad . Chase looks embarrassed to be involved in the movie and looks like he is just thinking about what he could spend his paycheck on ( probably looking for a new agent ) . but the worse to come out of this is Cox , who is just plain awful , and may find it difficult to continue to be the second most successful one from friends ( scream was a hit , but that was ten years ago ) and plays the Julianne Moore card ala ' Evolution by falling over every other minute for laughs . it doesn't work . all in all a plain , boring movie , which doesn't help by an unfunny script and uninvolved characters .

Micheal carter has a perverse obsession , over feeding women . he feels it is something they should have as they are goddesses and the people who consume are the strongest people on the earth , and those who do not ( supermodel , etc ) are the weak minded on this planet . but what his victim , Deidre does not know is that Carter is placing bets on line as to when she will expire , by taking her vital observations and recording them for all to see . Phillip Jackson is an Australian cop who comes across the website and decides to investigate the case further , as he is used to dealing with the psychotic variety of the human species . but Jackson soon finds out that the fine lines between victim and killer can soon become blurred . the tag-lines were very predictable'feels like se7en ' ' on a par with silence of the lambs ' ' grossly scary ' and other clich√©d summaries . the director is not the greatest in Brett Leonard ' the lawnmower man ' ' virtuosity'but i thought i would give the film a chance . the first 30 minutes was very good and interesting showing both perspective of cop and killer , mixed with some very ironic soundtrack music . this could have been very good if the film did not go off the different path and start to walk on the ' serial killer thriller with silly twist at the end ' road . once Jackson walks on to American soil , the film loses all its originality and shock value , and turns into an excuse to get the audience to feel nauseous and cause a bit of controversy . the problem is that you are so bored with the story and laughing at the terrible dialogue , that shock value is worthless and you are just waiting to see what silly twist the writers have up their sleeve . the most annoying thing about the movie is Carter , who is not a convincing villain and looks like a cut-price Jay Mohr . we are supposed to believe that he is a victim because he had a troubled life and was affected by this . but as all psychos go , he is a charming , well educated man , with a beautiful wife and house and . . . . yawn . we get on to Jackson and he is all Dirty Harry with his rough sex , breaking the rules and drinking vodka straight out of the bottle , but he is a very unconvincing hard man as he runs a mile when he is confronted by Carter and is beaten up very easily by a man who is half his size , so you start to care less about his ' mission ' . maybe this was the directors intention , for us to root for the bad guy and hope the good guy gets killed , but as i have said before , i was very un-interested by the time the film had gone past the hour mark . a waste of time , and not as shocking or as sick as you may have been led to believe . avoid like McDonalds ' burgers '

The only thing that this has in common with the original is the inclusion of Bud , which to be honest , is sacrilege . the infection ? oh , they begin to cough a bit and then the CGI hits them and they start to run around like drunk people trying to get to the kebab house before it closes . the story is puerile and the performances are pretty much the same . Suvari speaks and acts 2-dimensionally through the movie and as For Rhames , he barely utters a line before ' turning ' . there are some hideous stereo-types in the movie ( Salazar is the worst , what was Nick Cannon thinking ? ) and it all ends in a big CGI mess . if you are expecting anything like the original , or the re-make of Dawn Of The Dead , you are going to be sorely disappointed . oh , and it leaves the film , with a hint of a sequel . terrible

After many incidents and while in the trailers parking area , Bob is helped by the bizarre but friendly Gornicke family . They escape from the Gornickes and initiate a journey of difficulties and leaning , retrieving their forgotten family bonds . . . . . after being so impressive in movies such as Insomnia and One Hour Photo , Williams is back in this formula rubbish by once good director Sonnenfeld . barely raising a smile throughout the whole movie , Williams looks embarrassed to be in this movie and he has good reason to be . the film is filled with predictable fart jokes , the disgruntled family plot which is always the same with these kind of comedies and of course , the sub-plot involving Jeff Daniels and his family . on a positive side , the scenery is beautiful , but it's just so lazily made and looks like the director and the star just cannot be bothered to deliver the goods any more . things get even worse when the token speech at the end kicks in and all turns out good for the family . this would have gotten a one if it wasn't for Williams ' portrayal of a ' Gangsta ' halfway through the movie . for me RV stalled right at the beginning .
538848	3717154	477051	3.0	how you doin ' ? . . . .	Eddie Murphy goes for multiple characters again in this so called ' comedy ' . Murphy plays the titular character , who is a very unlucky man from the moment he is born , he is raised in an orphanage come restaurant , and meets Kate another orphan . when Kate leaves the orphanage , Norbit is left alone and soon makes friends with Rasputia . as the years go by , they eventually marry and Norbit realises that his life is doomed . but Kate returns and Norbit realises that he loves her . but Rasputias brothers are planning on buying the orphanage and turn it into a strip joint . they just need Kate to sign some papers and her fianc√©e ' is in on it too . can Norbit stop this catastrophe and get the girl , with hilarious results ? the latter part to the above is a big no , as this is one of the most turgid movies to be released this year . it's very racist , very sexist and very offensive . at first though , to be fair , it does raise the odd smile , but after a slew of Chinese ethnicity jokes and jokes surrounding fat people , it really does start to grate . whats even more annoying is the fact that Murphy has produced and written this mess . Murphy , the man who gave us Axel Foley , hilarious stand up with Raw and Delirious and the foul mouthed Reggie Hammond . it's such a shame that such talent has to go for gross out humour that was considered mildly amusing in 1996 when he released the nutty professor remake . the make up is extremely well done , but the characters have no imagination . Norbit reminded me of Murphys ' character in Bowfinger and Rasputia looks like a cast off of the Klump family . Newton does really well with the material given , but this is as really bad as what they say it is . it's as if Murphy and co . have thrown a lot of old jokes into a pot , and hope to get as many laughs as they could . the film goes from very bad to insane during the final act , and admittedly , you cannot help but laugh at the ridiculousness of the whole movie . this is Murphys worst film to date , and i am including Pluto Nash , Vampire in Brooklyn , Harlem Nights , Beverly Hills cop II , Daddy day care , and Another 48 hours . it's even worse than Best Defence .

The police believes the crime had a religious motive . Orville doesn't give any comment on the case , is taken into protective custody . Journalist Smith persuades him to help him in the investigation , and finds out about economic motives for the murder . most people know that when a cannon film was released in the eighties , and especially starring Dudikoff , Norris , or Bronson , you were going to be treated to some b-movie hokum , that was at least going to be fun . but this isn't . and has to be the worst of the Bronson Cannon collaborations that i have seen . Bronson just phones in his part , wearing the best wardrobe he can find from British home stores and looks as bored as the viewer . the story is not appealing and just doesn't sit right with this kind of film , and really with films like this , you should be able to sit back and laugh at the hokum , but the only thing i found funny was the end , where Bronson trips up the bloke running away from him ( we used to do that at school ) and the blood free suicide . for Bronson completists only , but be prepared to be disappointed .

When the influent Judge Irwin supports a group of politicians in their request of impeachment , Stark assigns Jack to find some dirtiness along the life of Irwin , leading to a tragedy in the end . . . All the king's men AKA the most blatant attempt to convince the academy that we have the best motion picture in a long time , starts badly , goes downhill in the second act , and the less said about the end , the better . now , a lot of people will disagree with me before seeing the film , as i was a bit confused by the media backlash at the time of release . i mean , a film with such a stellar cast , based on such fantastic source material , with a lot of pre-Oscar buzz , couldn't be all that bad , could it ? then the delays came and the box office was paltry , and it's easy to see why . it's badly acted , especially by Penn , who is very OTT and surprisingly unconvincing as Stark , and it appears that the rest of the cast have been asked to stand back and let Penn take centre stage . but the camera work is very good , and makes this debacle look a little stylish .

His gorgeous neighbour and super of the building , Charlotte , feels attracted for him , but the deranged Ben starts seeing his dead wife and is investigated by Detective Constable Jackson as a suspect of murdering Lauren Parris . . . . if you have the time or the patience to watch this movie more than once , you may get the jist of what is happening during the third act . not really enjoying the movie the first time , didn't give me the patience . it's quite a hard film to follow , and tries too hard to be clever . Evans cemented his reputation as a good film maker with ' My Little Eye ' which was a very taut and exciting spin on the Big Brother phenomenon . here , he sort of riffs on Argento movies of the seventies , and really makes a mess , despite a good performance from Firth and Suvari . the characters are uninteresting and not really likable , and it doesn't really leave you in suspense at any given time , so it just trudges with subliminal imagery and hallucinations for the second act . very disappointing stuff .
538413	3717154	419984	5.0	i'm an alcoholic , not a Barbie doll . . .	a simple light comedy , that probably only got the green light because Billy Bob Thorntons name was mentioned in passing . the premise is simple , a purl who was scarred by the titular character has become a successful novelist , thanks to his dealings with Mr . Woodcock . when he is invited back to his home town to receive an award , he is horrified to learn that his mother is now dating his former nemesis . now he will stop at nothing to split the two apart . and thats the story , done a thousand times before , done funnier and more original than this , but it is sometimes quite good due to the dead pan delivery of Thornton and the reasonable straight performance by Scott . Sarandon does the best thing she can do by stepping on the sideline and let the two leads battle it out , but all in all it's highly unoriginal but is worth ninety minutes of your life . if you like predictable comedies with a bit of slapstick , you could do a lot worse than this .

An African-American detective and a white missing child researcher team up to investigate the case , which they discover may be more complicated than they expected . . . . though the film is slickly made and has fantastic production values , the last fifteen minutes of the film absolutely ruins it's intention . most people know it's not about a missing child , it's about the racial tension caused because it appears to the community that a whits woman is getting priority over there community life . Jackson as usual is very good as Lorenzo but even he struggles with the material . but what also ruins the film is the usually fantastic Moore . here she is totally miscast as the mother and really overacts in her scenes , which makes it hard for the viewer to feel sympathy / empathy toward her . if the film had been made ten years earlier and had a better script then this could had been something , but with silly sub-plots and having a writer who does not seem to know how to end a film , this is a real waste .

( if you want to see superman in action , check out the second movie ) . gone also is the humour from II and III , and silly subplots spoil the film . narrative is non existent and plot holes are huge . you know when the titles roll and the music isn't quite right , you are in trouble . a perfect example of how a studio can ruin a movie . but supermans final line is very ironic ' see you in twenty '

A golden-boy war hero who single-handedly forced multiple German soldiers to surrender in WWI , Carter has dashing good looks and unparallelled speed on the field .

A cub journalist playing in the big leagues , Lexie is a spitfire newswoman who suspects there are holes in Carter's war story . But while she digs , the two teammates start to become serious off-field rivals for her fickle affections . As the new game of pro-football becomes less like the freewheeling sport he knew and loved , Dodge must both fight to keep his guys together and to get the girl of his dreams . Finding that love and football have a surprisingly similar play-book , however , he has one manoeuvre he will save just for the fourth quarter . . . although this film does have quite a few funny scenes and the two stars have the chemistry to make the film hold together , the whole thing is mediocre at best . it just seems that Clooney has been watching too many Cary Grant ' screwball ' comedies and is trying to mimic him throughout the movie . the main problem is that the film is overlong and some of the writing , while at times can be quite clever and endearing , drags and becomes dull and morbid . the sub-plot involving Carter is quite fun , but as before , it stretches too long for a film that would have been better suited to 90 minutes rather than nearly 2 hours . probably i should read up more on 1925 American football history then i would probably appreciate it more , but to me the film is clich√©d and ultimately predictable .

With time passing by and his family belittled by Evan's newfound realisation , Evan will have to do the work that God has given him in what promises to be an unusual adventure for a man who just wanted to serve his country , might actually be serving humanity . the main problem with this film is the good part is like waiting for the flood to come . Carrell seems very restraint in his role , and looks like he hasn't been given free rein to flow as previously seen in films such as Anchorman and The 40 year old virgin . in the original , Evan was considered as the villain of the picture , so turning the most hated character in the original to the hero of the new movie is a very silly , but unique idea . the film is aimed solely at the kids , but a lot of the jokes will go way over their head ( the 40 year old virgin Mary ? Evans wife is called Joan ( of ark ) , but the main spectacle is saved for the imminent flood , where probably most of the budget has been spent . but by then it's a case of too little too late . an average bland comedy , with a sickly sweet message at the end .

Adele researches ways of trying to find how to rescue her daughter from Annway . . . when a psychological thriller , predominantly involves sheep , which isn't intentionally funny or tongue in cheek , it doesn't bode very well . this film is very clumsily made and has very weak narration , but suffers from ' too many twists ' syndrome toward the end . people pop up and doe , little girls give messages of may save her daughter , and Sean Bean just spends most of the film shouting and trying to stop Bello from assaulting the girl . oh yes , and some sheep commit suicide . it's not a scary film , and won't win any prizes for originality , and the shocking ' twist ' at the end , is very predictable . just a very mundane movie , with not many redeeming features .

The first message arrives on Holly's 30th birthday in the form of a cake , and to her utter shock , a tape recording from Gerry , who proceeds to tell her to get out and " celebrate herself " . In the weeks and months that follow , more letters from Gerry are delivered in surprising ways , each sending her on a new adventure and each signing off in the same way ; P . S . I Love You . Holly's mother and best friends begin to worry that Gerry's letters are keeping Holly tied to the past , but in fact , each letter is pushing her further into a new future . With Gerry's words as her guide , Holly embarks on a journey of rediscovery in a story about marriage , friendship and how a love so strong can turn the finality of death into a new beginning for life . This isn't a bad movie , it's quite enjoyable in some places , but it's as subtle as a sledgehammer in others . Swank and Butler are great in the movie and the story is interesting but does drag on in some places . other characters in the movie begin to grate , such as Kudrow ( who is just in Friends mode yet again ) and Connick Jr . ( who is just plain weird . the idea though is great , it's just a shame that they made it just that little bit too long , because throughout the film , i did find myself clock watching .

Carver has the power to reach every person on the planet through his Carver Media Group Network - except for the People's Republic of Chinese who refuse his presence in their country . When he is tied to the disappearance of a British battleship in the South China Sea , James Bond is sent to investigate . It is in Hong Kong where Bond meets Wai Lin , a member of the People's External Security Force of China . With and without Wai Lin's help , Bond soon starts to uncover a plot that goes all the way back to a mission on the Russian-Kazakh Boarder , and will start a war only to feed the fire that is Carver's ego . . . not one of the best bond films made , it suffers from a very poor villain in the guise of Jonathan Pryce , who doesn't convince as an adversary worthy of Bond . instead he comes across as a snivelling spoilt little weasel , probably the Worst Villain since after Toby Stephens In DAD . Brosnan does his usual suave take on bond , but is given a script so hammy and cheesy , it could be put between two bits of bread and served as lunch . there are some positive points though . the pre credits sequence is exciting and full of what you'd expect from a big budget action franchise , the gadgets are good and bring a bit of light relief to the proceedings , and there are two good set pieces , one with the BMW , and the one with the motorbike . but these are majorly tainted by Yeohs boring character and stupid henchmen who are trying to hark back to the Moore / Connery days . it's all lethargically helmed by Spottiswoode , who seems a little out of his depth handling this sort of movie . not one of the best Bonds , but still worth a look .

Freeze , a former doctor whose blood is laced with cryogenic liquid , causing him to be cold in look and feeling who plans to freeze Gotham until he gets the money needed to finish finding the cure for a mysterious disease that has stricken his wife . Second , Poison Ivy , a villainess with luscious lips full of venom , has arrived in Gotham with her hulking servant , Bane , with plans to team up with Freeze and prepare the way for genetically enhanced plants . Third , Ivy has caused a rift between the partnership of the Dark Knight and the Boy Wonder . And finally , Alfred , Batman's trusted butler , has developed the same disease that Freeze's wife has . It is in this time of need that a new partner , Batgirl , steps forward to help the two rid the city of evil once more . some say this was the nail in the coffin for the franchise , but for me , it's a step up up from ' forever ' . Clooney looks like he is relishing his turn as the dark night , and he fits the role of Wayne well . Schwarzennegar is clearly having a ball as Freeze , and takes all the best lines ( but with this film , it's not saying much ! ) . again Scumacher goes all out campness and the sets are ghastly , also the story again is non-existent , but at least there is a little fun to be had at the end . this maybe the case that the film is ' so bad it's good ' but i cannot help but like parts of the film . the other surprise in this is Silverstone , who turns in a quite good performance as Batgirl . but again , compared to the first two movies , this is a laughable debacle , and shows no respect to the franchise . but like i have said before , i cannot help but like this movie . sorry ! !

Brunel doesn't really seem to care about his character and by this is simply mis-cast . the story is good and intriguing , but the execution is very poor . William hurt is great though in his role as the father and the rest of the support do fine with their material , but the film is very uncomfortable to watch and seedy and unsettling for no good reason . but the film does finish really well .

Sean Veil is an ultra paranoid murder suspect who takes to filming himself round the clock to provide an alibi , just in case he's ever accused of another crime . Problems arise however when the police do come calling and the one tape that can prove his innocence has mysteriously disappeared . . . another comedy actor tries to do a serious movie , with average results , and this time its none other than ' housewives favourite ' Lee Evans . playing a man who will not stop filming himself , which makes him even more freaky than he appeared at the beginning for shaving his head and eyebrows . but he is watchable and plays his part well , it's just down to the performances of the rest of the cast . Salmon who is usually reliable in his other work , looks like he is just wondering around in a vehicle for Evans serious side , whilst the rest of the cast just play your archetypal supporting roles . the final third tries to lay on some surprises , but by this time i was past caring and my main question was , why did he shave his eyebrows off ? the camera-work is wonderful though as is the editing , but i feel that this is trying to hard to be a thriller of hitchcockian standards ans is nowhere near as clever as it thinks . average .

A high-adrenaline tale of young climber Peter Garrett , who must launch a treacherous and extraordinary rescue effort up K2 , the world's second highest peak . Confronting both his own limitations and the awesome power of nature's uncontrollable elements , Peter risks his life to save his sister , Annie , and her summit team in a race against time . The team is trapped in an icy grave at 26 , 000 feet - a death zone above the vertical limit of endurance where the human body cannot survive for long . Every second counts as Peter enlists the help of a crew of fellow climbers , including eccentric , reclusive mountain man Montgomery Wick , to ascend the chilling might of the world's most feared peak to save her . . . an absolutely brainless movie from the usual reliable Campbell . by no means is the film bad , it's just totally unbelievable in parts . whilst watching this , one cannot help but feel that this is a last chance effort for O ' Donnell to reach the big time , but the most part of the movie , he just stands ( or jumps ) there pining for his sister . the set pieces can be stunning at times , but watching this movie on hi-def , you can really tell when they are filming on sets , especially at the beginning . but it's all brainless fun , explosion after explosion , climbers in difficult situations , and the script describes difficult to understand terms in layman's right away , to keep the audience involved . but the scenery is stunning , just watch it with a huge pinch of salt and enjoy . . . . . to an extent .

Carrey stars as a man who has a lot of coincidences that lead up to his wife buying him a book called the number 23 , and he starts to realise that he has a lot in common with the lead character , and starts to become obsessed with the number and the story . but as always with films like these , all is not what it seems . . . Carrey again tries to do something different for the big screen to reinvent himself after his star is starting to wane again in Hollywood , and decides to take this thriller / come noir tale under his wing and the results are quite average . the film promises so much and the build up is really interesting , but Carrey often doesn't look interested with the project and it all becomes sort of farcical come the final third . there are so many plot holes and so many questions that can be asked about this film , that in the end the film would not make any sense at all . throughout the film , there never is any real sense of dread or danger , and sometimes the film borderlines on just plain stupidness ( watch it and try not to smile when you see Ned for the third time ) . but there are a lot worse things to do with 90 minutes of your life than to watch this , watch it to see how desperate Carrey wants to stay famous . my advice , stick to doing what you do best , Gurning and making people laugh . 6+6+8+3 = average

Burnett is soon alone , trying to outrun a pursuing army , while commanding officer Reigert finds his rescue operation hamstrung by politics , forcing Burnett to run far out of his way . . . Owens foray into the action genre , is unfortunate to say , rather a damp squib . this is by no means due to Wilson himself ( although it does take a while to take him seriously ) , or the plot . it's down to the stupid MTV style editing and camera work that the director thinks will stand out . well it does stand out , but for all the wrong reasons . instead of all the flash cuts and slow motion making the movie more pulse pounding , it starts to irritate soon into the movie , as does some dodgy soundtrack choices . the does have a very cold bleak feel to it , which makes Wilsons mission a little more uncomfortable for the viewer . it takes a good 30 minutes for the film to kick in , and there are some good set pieces , but again these are tainted thanks to some cheap CGI , which really does look cheap when watched on Blu-Ray . it's not surprising that Wilson has steered clear of these sort of movies , because he does belong in comedy . it's a passable movie , but nothing spectacular , just like Moores other movies , very average .

Arnie is good in his role and always works good with Ivan Reitman . he has great chemistry with the kids and is a great father figure to them all . bu the standout of the show is Richard Tyson , who plays Crisp the bad guy . he is one bad guy you do want Arnie to kick through a wall , but the children do add to this emotion . not a bad film , but if it didn't have the dark tone to the film and was less profane , it would be good family fun .

However when the time comes to complete the mission she is unable to . The daughter is also being sought by the Hand , for she is known as a treasure that can tip the scales in favour of either good or evil . The Hand , who have the policy of " If we can't have her then no one can " , send their own people to kill her . Elektra then allies herself with the Millers and helps to protect them from the Hand . . almost completely forgetting the fact that she was killed in ' Daredevil ' the makers of this movie realised that the character was quite popular in the mentioned film ( popular in the fact that Garner is fit , not the fact that Elektra is interesting ) , so decided to give her her own movie . the solution ? easy , just get her resurrected by Terence Stamp ( who , does the most unconvincing blind man ever , he just looks down every now and again ) , and work from there . not knowing ( or really caring ) about the comic book of Elektra , the film does work on different levels , and on others it doesn't . Garner is good in her role , but doesn't show the warmth her character did in Daredevil ( maybe to do with the fact that she is dead ) and appears a lot more tough in this . her foes may as well be cast offs from Mortal Kombat , because thats how the film pans out in the second half , Elektra fighting foe after foe , each having different powers . for crying out loud , there's even a scene in a forest ala ' Scorpion in the original movie . but if these type of movies float your boat , then you could do a lot worse . there's the obligatory introduction about Elektra , and it's straight down to the action . the story is a complete rip off of ' the replacement killers ' , but if you are a Marvel fan , it will suffice .

A wild , illegal , and popular cross-country car is organised , and the eccentric entrants will do anything to win , including low-down , dirty tricks . . . . a movie with no real plot , no real story , this is just an excuse to showcase car stunts and gather an amazing ensemble cast for a bit of a laugh . you could imagine what the makers where thinking when they were filming this . ' yes we have the worlds most bankable star ( Reynolds ) , James Bond , the two funny ones from the Rat Pack , the boss eyed one from bonanza and the bloke from easy rider , we cannot fail ! ! well this movie is funny and it would have been great to see it filmed as they look like they were having so much fun while making it . and this is what the film is just fun , and it delivers it in shovel loads . Moore really stands out in his role , giving self parody a new high . referencing Bond movies ( the fly who bugged me ) and the saint , all doing this straight faced and even allowing himself to be smacked in the face and being fired from an ejector seat . otherwise this is forgettable stuff and nothing to write home about , but it is charming in its own special way .
538488	3717154	1130980	6.0	a deal is a deal . . . . . .	wrongfully advertised as a ' laugh riot ' , this film does have funny moments , but is a very sombre affair throughout . Crook plays a tube driver who falls victim to two people falling under his carriage in the space of two weeks , when his work colleagues tell him that if one more person falls under his carriage within four weeks , he will be paid off with ten years salary . he has a dream of buying a home in Scotland , so he can do what he does best , write . so when he comes across a vagrant who is attempting to jump off a bridge , he makes a pact with him , but they form a bond and more , when he meets his family and learns more about his life . this film reminded me ( cinematography wise ) of eighties movies such as Clockwise , Restless Natives and in some respects , Local hero . it's quite a grittily made movie , with a very cold feel about the film . the performances are very good , but it's really only funny in the very beginning and a few scenes in the lake District . Meany is reliable as usual , and it makes a refreshing change to see Crook , playing an ' ordinary ' guy . the final third gives a few twists to the audience and one that comes out of nowhere . if you are looking for a laugh out loud Brit-Comedy , you will be disappointed , it's very hard to place this film in a genre , it's too serious to be a black comedy , but too light to be a drama , it's a very different film that is worth seeing for the performances .

Jack is a man who wears tight suits , and loves his daughter , when meeting his father-in-law , he slips some sort of blood toxin into Jacks hand-held Pc , so he can carry it safely . meeting him later , old daddy gets blown up in a car , and Jacks daughter gets kidnapped by a taxi driver , now it's up to Seagal , his suede jacket , and numerous stunt doubles to save the day , whilst avoiding corrupt cops , the Russian mob and Vera Drakes men . the same old complaints are here for Seagal , using a voice over , though to be fair , it's to a minimum in this movie , but alas stunt doubles are used a lot in this movie ( what actor needs a stunt double for getting in and out of a car , and using stairs . plus the back projector during the car chases is as bad as the ones , used in ' north by northwest . but still Seagal uses a lot of martial arts in this movies , and for once the action is pretty slick , as is the story . lighting is bad though , although i must imagine that this is to cover Seagals chin ( s ) . but if you want to see Seagal in a good movie for once and with good support from the rest of the cast , this is one of the better movies he has made .

A search of the star charts reveals that they are completely lost in an uncharted sector of space but this is only the beginning of their problems . . . for all the effects that are thrown on to the screen in this movie adaption , it cannot mask the lack of story or narrative in the actual movie . the bottom line is , it's just an event movie , with a good cast and Gary Oldman as the ever faithful cheesy bad guy . he steals the show from anyone who dare share the screen with him , and is the best thing in the whole thing , even though he has some awful dialogue . a lot of it doesn't make sense , but for the kids , there's a cute little alien , and for the girls Joey from friends has become all macho . for everyone else , there's William Hurt and the aforementioned effects , which are very impressive . it's watchable , but but empty at the same time . on the plus side , the end credits are one of the best i have ever seen , and even though it leaves us with the fact that the makers were hoping that this would make enough money for it to to green-light a sequel , it doesn't spoil the spectacle . the cinema equivalent of watching a friend play a video game .

Although the plan goes awry , Thunderbolt and Lightfoot discover that they may still have succeeded-or so they think . . . . . . . part comedy , part thriller and part tragedy , this is a very bizarre movie from Eastwoods production company , with some very oddball characters and a little bit of a homosexual undertone to the movie . Eastwood plays against type as thunderbolt , someone who is very laid back and not like a ' traditional Eastwood character ' at all . Bridges is the more feminine sidekick ' lightfoot ' , trying to get it on with women all the time ( we never actually see him succeed ) , very loud mouthed and brash , but with such admiration for thunderbolt . but the film goes to George Kennedy who as Red makes for a very un-nerving character who is like a loose cannon . with some great scenery and a fantastic script , this film is very easy going , but some times the nudity and the violence does seem out of place in thunderbolt and lightfoots world . sometimes laugh out loud funny and sometimes very tragic , this is another of those Eastwood film that has been unfairly forgot about .

Leo arrests Mei , only to have Jin breaking her free in a plot to gain her trust and lead the police to the new leader of the secret organisation . But things are far more complicated than they seem . . . . this film was very very good until the final third of the movie , when revelation after revelation were revealed , and the whole thing became very messy . before this , the film was a beautiful study of the forbidden and the dangers of keeping secrets from the ones that you care for . the set pieces in this film are very impressive , exciting , yet at the same time haunting and poetic . the sounds of the wind breezing through the trees adds to the mood of the film . the performances are all fine and the characters are tremendous , but as i said before , it runs out of ideas toward the end and is a little too long . still a good movie , but nowhere near as good as ' hero ' or ' crouching tiger '

Stallone has possibly the funniest name in film history , playing an ex fire chief with a tragic past , who just happens to be in the right place at the right time . the rest of the cast are what you expect , and you can see which ones will come to a watery and and which ones will survive , but it's a produced , if sometimes poorly acted movie . the set pieces are fun and some of the movie is quite unbelievable , but it's Stallone in a disaster film with a cool name , what do you expect ? a good old fashioned disaster film , with a massive budget . worth seeing with some mates and a few beers .

Gus plans on extorting Reverend Smalls , with the intention of publicly exposing his secret shame , should he refuse , with this scandal potentially destroying the man's career . Normally cautious Charlie , is keen on participating in this scam , confident that with this money maker he'll garner from the deal and will finally help turn things around for him and his family . . . if you turn off your believability for 90 minutes , there is some fun to be had in this film which is heavily influenced by the Coen Brothers and film noir . Plot holes are rife throughout and the film becomes more ridiculous toward the finale , but is the sheer ridiculousness of the film that actually makes it work , and what makes it so funny . deep down inside , you know that everything is going to go awry , and that no character is what they seem , ala ' Twin Peaks . Pegg as usual is fantastic in his role and pulls off a very convincing accent , and Schwimmer just about loses that ' Ross ' feel to him . with a macabre ending , some great camera-work and narration , Big Nothing is something .

Uncle Benny , Chinatown's mob boss , has imported Chinese slaves to pay for an artist to create counterfeit Chinese currency which the Triads will use to buy the Four Fathers ( heads of the Triads ) back from the Chinese military . not only have they got to contend with this , but Rianne is pregnant and married to a police officer , unbeknownst to Roger . . . . the fourth and maybe final movie in the franchise feels a lot weaker and a lot more softer than the previous three . watching the movie though does feel like having family you have not seen in a while round for dinner and the beautiful chemistry between Gibson and Glover is still here . after Conspiracy theory , Donner has once again proved he is a master at the sction genre , as this delivers the action in droves , although it seems a little watered down for the lethal weapon Veterans . the story is a basic money laundering one , and won't win any awards , but they could have written anything , and this would have been green lighted . the only weak point about this film is Rock , who feels very out of place , and seems to be in his stand up mode for most of his scenes , which is quite annoying . now some may say that this may be due to the fact that he joined the series so late , but Russo did too , and fitted well into the ' lethal family ' straight away . but it's a great finish to a great series of movies , and if you have not seen any of the previous movies and were going to see this first , my advice is don't , watch them in chronological order , as you will really appreciate the jokes and the references .

There Roddy meets Rita , an enterprising scavenger who works the sewers in her faithful boat , the Jammy Dodger . Roddy immediately wants out , or rather , up ; Rita wants to be paid for her trouble ; and , speaking of trouble , the villainous Toad - - who royally despises all rodents equally , making no distinction between mice and rats - - wants them iced . . . literally . The Toad dispatches his two hapless hench-rats , Spike and Whitey , to get the job done . When they fail , the Toad has no choice but to send to France for his cousin - - that dreaded mercenary , Le Frog . . . not a bad effort from Dreamworks and Aardman , but it doesn't really bring anything new to the world of computer animated movies . the voice cast are exceptional and all stand out as being recognisable . my only problem is that Reno was obviously typecast as Le Frog . but there are references to dozens of other movies and the animation is stunning , so in some respects , it does call for a repeat viewing . and it's good to see predominantly British Movie be self deprecating toward our views ( eg . the whole sub-plot surrounding the world cup ) . adults may find this a little dull and predictable , but the kids will lap it up . the characters are bright and funny , but there are plenty of characters involved in the whole story . worth a watch .

OK so to begin with it's just your average thriller . girl goes to look after an elderly man for an obscene amount of money per week ( for a carer anyway ) , and almost immediately senses that something is not quite right . so far , so predictable . . . . . . the film continues with by the numbers horror / supernatural thriller , woman of the house explains the past of the house ( with the token black and white flashback ) whilst five minutes later , a voodoo priestess ( is that right ? ) explains the history of the house from a slightly different angle . then you get your obligatory rain storms , power cuts , dream sequences and jump shocks . this is when i started to tire of ' the skeleton key ' . i thought i knew the twist from the upstart , but what Ehren Kruger has done has thrown so many red herrings into the pot that i actually went totally the wrong way about the narrative . the only bad thing about films like this is that when tabloids and magazines review this type of film , they always mention the twist . thank you M . Night Shyalaman ! ! ! if you really want to enjoy a film like this , ignore the reviews , do not read them and sit back and enjoy . contradicting the above statement , the twist is above par and is really disturbing . Hudson and Rowlands work really well together and the story is quite original . it's just a shame that Softley did not use an original approach to this type of movie and delve into the history of voodoo , and leave the weather forecast to the weathermen .

Jim Carrey is back , in one of his most endearing roles in a long time . he plays a guy , who has to say yes to everything after attending a seminar led by Zod from Superman II , and guess what ? hilarity is the rule of the day ! ! it's a great concept , the book is better , only following that by title alone , but Carrey can do this sort of stuff in his sleep , but thankfully for the audience , he's fully awake for the duration . i wasn't really looking forward to this , it seemed too much of a hybrid of ' Bruce almighty ' and ' Liar , Liar ' but the narrative and performances do the film justice and make it a really endearing film all the way through . it proves that Carreys star is still shining , and when he put's his mind to it , he can make a movie work . i'not saying that he's made a second coming . his best work in my opinion has long gone , he just hasn't got that wow factor anymore , because he just went into overdrive so early in his career and thats a shame . but for Carrey fans this will please them , but don't expect the belly laughs from his mid nineties classics , there is fun to be had , but it just makes you smile , rather than laugh . all in all it's a good movie , but nothing memorable .

Or will Imhotep do so and rule the world ? Or worse . . . Is the Scorpion King so powerful that he cannot be defeated , and he himself will raise the Army for global victory ? this sequel was never going to live up to the first instalment , but it does have it's moments . the director obviously knows what the audience found exciting in the original , so he implements a lot of the elements of that one in here . the film is a lot bigger than the first one , yet this one tries and caters for the family , by the inclusion of the annoying child , and having a wrestler in a bad guy role . Fraser does his beast Indiana Jones impression , and it sails along nicely , until the final set piece where Fraser and Vosloo fight the worst piece of CGI ever committed to film . it's loud throwaway summer popcorn fluff , instantly forgettable . one of those movies that when you watch it a second time , you wonder what all the fuss was about .

While San Juan celebrates San Sebastian's Feast , recently-divorced and world-weary police captain Victor Benezet calls in prominent attorney Henry Hearst to clarify his statement about discovering the body of a girl of about 12 , the second such murder in two weeks . As Hearst answers unconvincingly , Benezet reveals circumstantial evidence : the lawyer is under suspicion . The interrogation strips away Hearst's dignity , public persona , and even his toupee , exposing a breech with his beautiful and much younger wife , questionable sexual predilections and a damning hobby . Then , Hearst's wife volunteers information that confirms police suspicions . Is Hearst finally at the breaking point ? . . . . as intriguing as the movie is , it's the ending that really suffers with problems . the main problem being that it doesn't know how to end , so from an amazing 110 minutes of vocal fisticuffs from the two leads , we are basically given a nonsense ending , which i guess Hopkins would have hoped would have the audience debating and so on . the main question i was asking at the end of the film was , why ? and what was the whole point ? obviously people are going to have their own opinions of Hearsts reason , as i do myself , but a lot of people may feel a little cheated as the film does lead the audience up the ' big revelation ' path , only for them to hit a brick wall . but the film is great to watch and offers red herrings galore . Jane in particular was a very suspicious character , and threw me off the films trail at times , but the film is a lesson in acting masterclass whenever hackman and Freeman share the screen . a genius part of film making is putting all the characters into Hearsts recollections , as i feel this would have been a rather redundant production if it was in one setting . Maybe Hearst was taking his power and seeing how far it would take him , or maybe he wanted to set his wife free , the explanation is never revealed , but if you are a fan of the two leads , this will suffice .

Terry keeps looking for answers . . . what starts off as an intriguing thriller , ends up really nowhere , but showing us lovely locations in the world , the odd sweaty fumble between the two leads , and James Woods as his usual slimy self , the type of role he could do now in his sleep . the premise is simple and should be effective , but it seems that the makers of the film have spent far too long on the locations and making the stars look good , rather than character development and a good narrative . still at least Phil Collins will always be remembered for this !

The nineteen years old Catholic college girl Emily Rose dies a couple of days after being submitted to an exorcism carried out by her parish priest , Father Moore . Emily believed she was possessed by six demons , and although authorised by Emily and he parents , Father Moore is accused of negligent homicide , since he had suggested Emily to interrupt the use of medications for epilepsy . In order to avoid a scandal , the Archdiocese hires the successful , ambitious and agnostic lawyer Erin Bruner , and the prosecution assigns the religious prosecutor Ethan Thomas . Along the days , there is a battle between science and religion in the court . . . . the trailers made this out to be quite a hard core horror movie , and any movie that has any influence to the world of exorcism , can be quite ' special to some horror aficionados since the release of ' that ' film in 1973 . but the majority of the film is placed in court , and it is quite interesting to see the story viewed from both sides , from the sceptics to the believers . all of the cast are fine , even if Tom Wilkinsons accent is a bit dodgy at times , he portrays Moore with great ease and brings a lot of ' soul to the character . Carpenter too is good in the titular , but then again , she doesn't have much else to do than look scared , angry , and perplexed . a horror film with a difference , but with some very good chills in the flashback sequences , but sometimes it just seems to be too clever for it's own good .
538496	3717154	783608	7.0	walk this way	from the start of the movie , the narration hints at film noir , and for some reason , until i saw Harrelsons character on a computer , i was sure the film was set in the fifties . the plot is simple , an escort finds a dead body in the house of someone he escorts and gets stuck into the middle of things , thats the plot basically , but the writing and directing is done so wonderfully , that a story this simple is advanced greatly due to the narrative . Harrelson puts in an almost career best performance as the titular character , a homosexual who women like to be seen with , but proves the theory that beauty is only skin deep and he learns not to be so nice to people . the moods change with harrelsons ' sexuality ' , when he's with the ladies , it's almost a restoration piece , yet when hes with the same sex , you could almost be forgiven that you were watching ' irreversible ' . a recommended film , the soundtrack is wonderful as is the dialogue , it does begin to falter toward the end , but is worth watching

Biggs and Fischer make a fantastic couple on screen , and have some great chemistry together . but with films like this , it's the supporting cast who get all the big laughs , especially Andersons highly sexed parents , who are really funny and not overused in this film , they probably have no more than five scenes on screen . Pantoliano is good in his role , but i feel it's a role that did not need to be in a film like this , but he's fun never the less . it's light hearted and very romantic , showing that Hollywood can still make comedies without the use of human excrement .

Meanwhile , Marley gains no self-discipline . Marley's antics give John rich material for his newspaper column . As the Grogans mature and have children of their own , Marley continues to test everyone's patience by acting like the world's most impulsive dog . . . . if you know what to expect from this film , like all the tabloid reviewers say , take some tissues . it's a saccharine sweet comedy , certainly not for diabetics , but it has something a little more than other ' dog ' movies have , it's plot follows the the family and their trials and tribulations more than the dogs aberrant behaviour . Wilson puts in a very restraint performance and Aniston is rather good for someone out of Friends , and this shows that she still is the most successful out of the Sitcoms stars . it's not laugh out loud funny , and it's not trying to force feed you life lessons , it's just a fun film to watch , and showing you that the grass isn't always greener , when you think that person has everything ( see Wilsons friend , who uses his child to pull women ) . a great date movie .

But when an evil villain threatens his family , friends and the very sanctity of Sky High , Will must use his newfound superpowers to save the day and prove himself a Hero worthy of the family tradition . . . i really wasn't expecting much from this film , it wasn't massive at the box office , the reviews were average at best , and the thought of Kurt Russell in a padded suit was enough to put anyone off their nachos . but i was delighted at this fast paced , often very funny , and clever , typical high school movie with the superhero twist . the young cast are all great , and it was nice to see Russelll with tongue firmly in cheek throughout the whole movie . and for once it wasn't as predictable as what i thought . there are some great supporting roles , and the special effects are really good too . it's a family movie that caters for everybody , it has the high school movie element , and the superhero curve , and at just over 90 minutes , is fast enough to keep anyone from becoming bored of this little gem . recommended
538947	3717154	338216	8.0	sometimes nothings enough . . . .	Eric Bana stars in this drama with the best name for a cinema character ever , Huck Cheever , a gambler who is living in his fathers shadow . he spends most of his time in Las Vegas casinos playing against amateur poker players to earn a little cash . the only thing is , Huck is known as a blaster , someone who just won't fold his cards , his greatest adversary is his father , or is it himself ? the film leads up to the poker world series , and along the way he meets up with Drew Barrymore who does little else in this film than act little kooky and get mad with Huck in one scene . directed with very much flair by Hanson , nothing really happens much in the movie , but it's the array of characters and their tics that makes the film so involving for its duration , with a great cameo from Robert Downey Jr . as one of Hucks friends ( or people who will lend him money ) bana is fantastic as Cheever , and you do really care for his character and his issues with his father . Duvall also plays a great role , probably one of his best this decade , and grabs the movie from under Bana whenever he is on screen . the only weak link is Barrymore , who does very little in the film apart fro looking sweet and speaking lines like they have been taken from fortune cookies . but overall this film is terribly underrated and is a great drama and quite intense in some scenes . well worth watching .

As their crime empire expands , they have to deal with many problems , including their own differing opinions on how to run their business , the local Godfather , and the psychotic Mad Dog . one of those movies that you saw when you were all but a teenager and when watched for the first time in over ten years , you realise , it's not that good , but you still hold a little place in your heart for it . basically a ' young guns ' movie for the teenagers who loved ' goodfellas ' , Mobsters is hilariously miscast , but beautifully shot and although it appears very botched , a lot of love has been put into the project . the slow motion scenes with the tommy guns are laugh out loud , as are the vox-popped poker scenes and newspaper articles with the long scenes with the big band playing a score in the background . seasoned vets such as Abraham and Quinn , seeing the big ' Ker-ching ! ' in their eyes , and seeing young saplings such as Slater and Dempsey giving it the big one is pure cringeworthy . but in 1992 it wasn't . it was the epitome of cool . it was the film makers trying to get the youngsters to understand the prohibition and ' mobs ' . it was for people who were not allowed to see ' Bugsy ' or ' Goodfellas ' , so there parents would see that Slater was in this and think ' ok , he's a good role model , let them see this ' . it's all pure guilty pleasure , hokum of the highest order , but i was one of those teenagers .

538889	3717154	829482	8.0	did you have fun last night ? . . . . . .	a high school comedy with a difference , the leads are not good looking bronze gods ala ' every other teen comedy that has been released , this is a real comedy with everyday teens with everyday troubles , and what makes this comedy work so well is that it has been written from obvious experience , and the viewer can relate to certain parts of the film ( eg . worrying about the first time , will he / she like me ? ) the story is simple , the geekiest guy on the planet gets fake ID the same time his friends are invited to a party by the girls of their dreams , the girls ask them to buy the alcohol for the party , plain and simple narration . but the story is way beyond this , with the predicaments the trio get themselves into , the set pieces are very funny and very , very crude , believe me if you were offended by American Pie , stay well clear of this , there is a lot of profanity , and it might even make you think twice about bumpin ' and grinding with a random female ( my favourite part of the film ) . the film usurps other movies in the same sub-genre because it has a humanistic edge to it , we actually empathise with the characters as they are so real , these are the type of people who sat next to us in class , their different from the kids we saw in Clueless , Mean Girls and even American Pie , thats what makes the film so refreshing and laugh out loud funny . . . you care for the characters . the writers can make you laugh out loud one minute , and give you a lump in the throat the next , the characters are well written and by the time the movie is over , you realise the film wasn't about a quest to get laid or get some alcohol , it's about three normal guys getting ready to face the world apart from each other , and having to come to terms with responsibility , thats probably why the two cops have that monologue at the end , they were where the main characters are in the film , and their chance went begging . a great comedy , stupid , yet clever and a very poignant ending .

Bond must face not only Zorin himself , but the equally twisted May Day and Scarpine , another one of Zorin's henchmen . Assisted by San Francisco City employee Stacy , Bond goes after the would-be computer magnate in a series of frightening confrontations - including fire in the SF City Hall , a wild chase through the city with Stacy at the wheel of a fire department ladder truck , and finally in a hand-to-hand fight atop San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge . . . okay it's not the best Bond film ever made , but it's a damn sight better than Brosnans efforts ( Goldeneye aside ) and it's probably the campest of the Roger Moore Legacy . yes he is too old for the role , but he just about manages to pull it off , thanks to his trademark wit , and some great support from a marvellous walken and an over top Grace Jones as Mayday . the opening montage is quite exciting , although the special effects are a bit dated now , but it all adds to the fun of the movie . For some reason Moore screams like an old man about four times in the movie ( see the bit where he is hanging from the blimp and gets his knackers hit by the aerial , prime example ) , and to add to this Walken Laughs at the doctor just as he is about to die , which pretty much sums up the whole movie . still , it features the best bond song ever , great locations and some hilarious action . the plot as always is covered in about a minute in the Ministers office , and after that , just sit back and enjoy some ridiculous Bond fun . as i said before , not the best , but every Bond fan should have a little bit of love for this entry .

Matrix agrees but on the plane , he makes a dramatic escape and with the help of Cindy , he has eleven hours to rescue Jenny and stop the bad guys from contacting Arius , who is holding Jenny hostage . alongside the terminator and predator , this has to be the quintessential Schwarzeneeggar vehicle . he is a no holds barred superhuman , who will stop at nothing to rescue what he loves . he is an obvious parody of Rambo and this movie is more comic book and tongue in cheek than the said movie . Arnold is fine in his role , he just needs to look mean and kick some butt , and he does with style . story is thrown out of the window in favour of explosions and body count . it's a simple story , and one that has been recycled many times since . Vernon Wells is hilarious as Bennett , and has to be the most campest villain ever seen in an action movie , with his beer gut , chain mail vest and knee high boots , it's obvious from the start who will win the final duel . but films like this are not made for the critics , they are made for the public who love a good hero movie . as the old adage goes , they don't make films like these anymore as studios tend to make action movies like these more accessible for teenagers , so a lot of the violence is thrown out of the window in favour of fast editing and shaky camera work . do yourself a favour , if you don't own this already , buy the region 1 version as all others are edited for violence . great escapism .

Seagal really shows what he can do in the films set pieces , and they are decidedly graphic and will satisfy those who love martial arts . the story is simple and easy to follow , but th editing lets the side down a little . not as good as his warner Bros . movies of the same eras , Marked for death is still a good action movie with a great star .

Now Bill must fight not for his future , but for those he loves . . anybody thinking that Brad Pitt as death in the remake of ' death takes a holiday ' would be right to give a big gulp at the prospect . not only does Pitt bring an almost innocent performance in his role , he is endlessly watchable in this bittersweet tale . ably supported by Hopkins and a career best performance from Forlani , the film does drag in several places and their is a pointless but poignant sub-plot involving Pitt and an amazing island accent . Even at it's epic running time , the film never really ails , with Hopkins becoming stronger in character as he ever reaches nearer to his date with destiny . sloppy for some , but for those who like a good old fashioned romantic drama , this is a lot better than some of the slop Hollywood is dishing out now .

Aurora's interludes with Garrett Breedlove , retired astronaut and next door neighbour are quite striking . In the end , different people show their love in very different ways . i wish i wasn't so curious and demanded a friend of mine to tell me the ending , because while watching and really enjoying the performances and struggles of all the characters involved , i couldn't help but having the inevitable ending in the back of my head throughout the duration . but the film is near flawless and the performances from all the main cast are fantastic , especially Maclaine and Nicholson , as the bickering neighbours . it wears it's heart on it's sleeve and Brooks proves that he is a good story maker and can make a great film . such a film to watch in whatever mood your in , it will bring a smile and tears to you throughout .

Freeman does his obligatory narration ( is this written somewhere in his contract ) and as always , his voice brings a lump to the throat just hearing him . but the film is very lighthearted and gentle , despite the subject matter , and there are some great performances from the cast . well worth seeing before you ' kick the bucket '

So Doc and Marty have to go back to when Biff got the book and get it away from him . And it seems that it was in 1955 on the night of the dance that Biff got the book . So not only must they get the book but they must also avoid the other versions of themselves . . . oh my god , it would help to have a degree to understand this movie , but beneath the layers of story , sub-plots and going backwards and forwards in time , this film does work , and in my opinion it ranks as the best of the series . the special effects are not so special now , but the ideas of the hover boards and the flying cars are sound as are other little subtle things such as the eighties caf√© ' and clothing lines . but the story is the main thing about this film . you really need to watch the movie from beginning to end to really understand what is going on and watch it twice more to confirm this . for a family film , it doesn't really matter for young children about the story , as they will be in awe of the special effect , future designs and seeing Fox and Wilson in multiple roles . but this is still one hell of a movie and by the end of it all of the loose ends are ( nearly ) tied up and Zemeckis has great fun in doing this . repeating set pieces from the original in different time zones and also re-creating footage from the first movie . a major feat in its time , BTTF part 2 has stacks of story and an easy narrative to follow with plenty of red herrings thrown into the mixture . it's just a shame that the cliffhanger developed into such a lacklustre sequel . inspired viewing
538371	3717154	376994	8.0	the last stand ? naaaaah ! ! ! !	first there was the original x-men movie . OK so this was to tell the story of the x-men . which to be frank was pretty boring . and had the worst line in cinema history ( the line what storm says to toad just before hi demise . something like ' you know what happens to a toad when it is struck by lightning ? . . the same as everything else ' ! ! ! then x-men united came out which was better but with spider man being released the year before , just didn't really cut the mustard . BUT . . . when these films are viewed together , they make great viewing , the characters are very in depth and intense and you actually sympathise with these ' mutants ' . now to the last stand . maybe the best of the three , but the best for pure spectacle . Ratner has directed this , when i heard he was to be the helmer , i did have reservations , as this is the guy who really made Chris tucker a big big star . what ratner has done has made a film for the public and fanboys alike . it's not advisable to watch this as a standalone feature as you will be lost in the plot , and the host of characters that are involved . then there are the characters . a lot of the characters are pushed back or disposed of quite quickly to involve the four main characters . namely , wolverine , phoenix / jean grey , magneto and storm ( even though i do not believe that storm is integral to the plot , maybe she should have been killed at the lake instead of cyclops ) . then there are the characters who are pushed aside . really the only one who this happens to is rogue , who was really a vital part to the last 2 movies , here she is shown to be a believer of the cure and that is really all she does in the movie . then there is mystique , again someone who was vital ( and fun ) in the previous two , again pushed aside for no reason at all and unfortunately wasted in the movie . these are pushed aside for the new characters . the main addition here is of the beast , a secretary for the mutants who has brains as well as brawn . Kelsey grammar is tremendous in this role and it shows he has been watching old episodes of Frasier to prepare him for the role . but in true comic book style , he does kick butt toward the end . i feel that angel was wasted as he was in a prologue at the beginning but alas we never see a lot of action from him and poor Ben foster only has a handful of lines . juggernaut is the only mutant that lets the brotherhood down . Vinnie Jones should stick to playing typecast gangsters than appearing in films like this . for the film itself , the story is good if not solid , the script is funny and fast moving , and there are some nasty surprises along the way for those who are not in the know . the special effects are groundbreaking too . OK everyone will be raving on about the golden gate bridge scene , which is impressive , but for me , it's right at the beginning where the fx team have made magneto and Xavier appear twenty years younger . amazing . this film may not be to everyones taste , and there will be fanboys who will moan at the style , but if like me you like comic books , but are not obsessed and are not really bothered by minor changes to characters , then you will be in for a treat . this is really the first hit of the summer in an otherwise really season of letdown movies . just one little gripe about the movie . after the moving of golden gate bridge , it suddenly becomes night time for no reason , which does really stand out ( i think this was intentional though to make the action more intense ) . and stay after the credits , there is little treat there for fans

Fox is great as Jamie , putting in an effortless performance as a man whose life is going from bad to worse . it's a shame though that Sutherland and Cates are limited to minor roles as they are very good with the material that they are given . the New York photography is marvellous and makes the city look very melancholy in some scenes . but there are some unintentional laugh out loud moments and some very bizarre situations . was there really any need for Jamie to run away from his brother ? the catwalk piece is very cringworthy , but for a drama , it scores very high , and can be very depressing in some areas of the movie . but the soundtrack and cinematography is a marvel and is worth seeing .

Joe and Olivia are also two very lonely people , but for different reasons . Joe has to work all day by himself and Olivia has split up from her husband and has recently lost a son . so these three people become friends of sorts , but rarely socialise and barely speak to one another . when they are together , it can become quite cringe-worthy for the viewer as one wants to be part of their group and bond with them . there are some great performances in this film especially from Dinklage and Clarkson . the story is highly original , and for a film where nothing happens much , you can barely take your eyes off the screen thanks to the cinematography and tight narrative .

Realizing his dire situation with the lunatic leader unwilling to let him go home , Garrigan must make some crucial decisions that could mean his death if the despot finds out . . . if anyone was deserved of an Oscar for a performance , then Whittaker did for this . his portrayal of Amin is sympathetic , yet menacing , and his eyes do most of the work for him . whenever Whittaker is on screen , he commands every line and his co-stars pale in comparison . McAvoy is fantastic as the doctor in a no win situation , firstly admiring Amiin and slowly becoming to fear him as the realisation that the president is psychotic dawns on him . Macdonald has made a magnificent film , putting you in the doctors shoes and making you feel the fear that the doctor is feeling and the ever growing tension is evident throughout the movie . an amazing movie based on amazing source material , this has to be seen .

Jackson raises the bar on effects again with Kong , probably the most impressive thing ever seen on screen , and believe me when i say that only seeing this film on the big screen ( or hi-def on a very big screen ) will do Kong justice . there has been painful attention to detail with the effects and they work seamlessly well with the cast . all the cast do really well in their roles , especially Black ( whom i personally do not rate ) who utterly convinces as the slimy Denham , who is thinking of nothing but himself and his pockets throughout the films running time . and what a running time . at nearly three hours , the film does fly by , but during the very long second act , it does seem to drag a little , and the chase set pieces with the dinosaurs does seem a little over stretched , and this is why it doesn't get the full ten . it does take the edge from the excitement for a while . but all in all this is an event film of the highest order , just slightly let down by over indulgence of the set pieces .

The people soon discover that within the mist lives numerous species of horrific , unworldly creatures that entered through an inter-dimensional rift , which may or may not have been caused by a nearby military base . As the world around them manifests into a literal hell-on-earth , the horrified citizens try desperately to survive this apocalyptic disaster . . the good thing about this very tense , taut , thriller is that it doesn't focus too much on the beasts that are surrounding the supermarket . what we get is an insight into what people will do to survive , whether or not their belief in faith is justified , or should it be every man for themselves ? the party in the supermarket segregate between the believers ( led by a sinister Marcia gay Harden ) and the people who want to survive ( ultimately led by Jane ) . at eleven minutes in to the film the tension really begins with a lone man running into the supermarket declaring ' they've taken John Lee ! ' and from then on it's panic stations for our various characters . Darabont knows how to write characters and how to shoot set pieces , and while this isn't up there with Shawshank and the Green Mile , it's still one of the best thrillers of the year with some cracking performances and on of the most ironic and depressing endings i have ever seen . highly recommended .

Fleeing for help , Jenny is subject to a brutal and relentless game of cat-and-mouse as she desperately tries to evade her young pursuers and find her way out of the woods . . . first off , this is not a film that is going to entertain . it's not a film that has any feel-good value in the proceedings , and it's definitely not one to take a girlfriend / wife to see . saying that , it's a shocking , expertly made piece of British drama , that tackles one of the biggest hot potatoes the UK is dealing with today , youth culture . i can already envisage a few months down the line when this film gets the blame for every violent act committed on someone in england . the film though is fantastic . it's relentless , never gory , but has enough atmosphere about it to stay with you long after . thats thanks to the young cast who plat the said ' youths ' , especially O'Connell , who makes your skin crawl as the main protagonist Brett . he has to be the worse possible young person you could ever wish to meet , and his character takes violence to the extreme . the tension mounts up during the second act , and thankfully never lets up until the final moment when a character breaks the fourth wall . this owes more than a little to the likes of southern comfort , deliverance , wrong turn , and even the Texas chainsaw massacre . it's surprising just how good this films , and it's destined to have a cult following , and it's destined to be hated equally too . a very uneasy viewing experience , but one , which is worth the experience , despite the shocks .

During the slaughter , the samurai escapes with the help of the innkeeper ; but while recuperating at a nearby temple , he learns of innkeeper's abduction by Unosuke , and returns to the town to confront him . if you have seen Last man standing or a fistful of dollars , the premise is pretty much the same , but this is Kurosawa we are talking about , and with Mifune as the titular character , this is one his most exciting and forfilling movies to watch . it's true he has made better films , but the film is so much fun to watch and the narrative is so rich and concise , you cannot help but fall in love with the main protagonist . the film is very humorous yet very dark , and subtle touches such as lighting really add gravitas to the movie . the samurai is almost ghost like in some scenes , like Eastwoods character in high plains Drifter , a human form of the grim reaper , who has arrived to clean up ' the village ' . there is so much that this film connotes , that it demands repeat viewings , for it's sheer elegance . a unique masterpiece .

In the 1960s , British painter Francis Bacon ( 1909-1992 ) surprises a burglar and invites him to share his bed . The burglar , a working class man named George Dyer , 30 years Bacon's junior , accepts . Bacon finds Dyer's amorality and innocence attractive , introducing him to his Soho pals . In their sex life , Dyer dominates , Bacon is the masochist . Dyer's bouts with depression , his drinking and pill popping , and his satanic nightmares strain the relationship , as does his pain with Bacon's casual infidelities . Bacon paints , talks with wit , and , as Dyer spins out of control , begins to find him tiresome . Could Bacon care less ? seeing this in the year 2008 was a bit of a curioso for me , bond has sex with the bloke who voices in the night garden ? but after the shock , i was treated with an excellent movie , sometimes very scary and nightmarish , and it sucked me in for the whole duration . both of the leads are wonderful , and the direction and cinematography gives the whole film a really depressing feels , it's as if you are feeling Georges pain throughout the whole movie . if you can stomach the content , and the slight pretentiousness to it all , you will be treated to a very well acted overlooked movie . excellent in a masochistic sense .

But while the latter is already the leader of a guerrilla squad fighting for the independence of his motherland , Damien , a medical student at University College , would rather finish his training at the London hospital where he has found a place . However , shortly before his departure , he happens to witness atrocities committed by the ferocious Black and Tans and finally decides to join the resistance group led by Teddy . The two brothers fight side by side until a truce is signed . Bur peace is short-lived and when England imposes a treaty regarded unfair by a part of the population war resumes , this time pitting Irishmen against Irishmen , brothers against brothers , Teddy against Damien . . . a very political movie , which opinion will be divided , but no one can doubt the pain and struggle that the Irish faced against the Black and Tan at this time . what they did was for their country , their freedom , and their dignity . they have no joy in killing their own ( see the scene where Damien has to execute a young boy ) . a very powerful movie by Loach , who pulls no punches with his stark imagery and direction . Murphy is fantastic , in probably his finest role to date . if you are English , you may feel a little guilty about how our ancestors treated the Irish . as i said , a very topical and important movie , with a bitter sting at the end of the tale . recommended
538588	3717154	46250	9.0	at midnight , i'll turn into a pumpkin and drive away in my glass slipper	Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn have impeccable chemistry in this classic of the golden age of cinema . Ann has clearly had enough with her life as royalty . She rebels against her peers after she has been given a sedative , but before it has a chance to work , she escapes from her room , to see how ' the other half live ' . After losing at a game of cards , Joe is walking the streets of Rome in the early hours of the morning . He stumbles across Ann , mistaking her for being drunk . Unsuccessfully trying to get her home , she spends the night at his apartment , after reciting poetry to him and declaring that she is ' so very happy ' . Late for work , Joe discovers that he has been hiding the missing royal , and plans to release an exclusive interview with her , candid photos et al . taking her on an expedition through beautiful Rome , he finds in Ann a woman of beauty who has lived a sheltered life , a little schoolgirl ( as she claims she is ) who has yet to experience the real world . predictably , they fall for each other and learn a few lessons about their professions and personal lives . with outstanding cinematography and narrative , this is a picture that only directors of this generation could dream of making . with subtle references to Cinderella ( Ann losing her shoe in the opening scene and lines that reference the story ) , Hepburn plays the anti - Cinderella , the rich girl living a normal persons life . going to the ball and instead of having to leave , being forced to leave . homaged in Notting Hill , this is the type of film to watch while experiencing love , and one to watch when trying to romance your loved one . perfect .

His self-appointed mission is to stop the drugs trade and the number one supplier Victor Manning . Whilst involved in an undercover operation to entrap Victor Manning , his partner gets killed , and a sinister newcomer enters the scene . . . Along with F . B . I . agent Lawrence Smith , the two investigate a spate of mysterious deaths ; normal non-junkies dying of massive heroin overdoses and bearing the same horrific puncture marks on the forehead . This , coupled with Caine's own evidence , indicates an alien force is present on the streets of Houston , killing and gathering stocks of a rare drug found only in the brain . . . Caine is used to fighting the toughest of criminals , but up to now they've all been human . . . first released in 1990 , this was one of Lundgrens high profile theatrical releases and one of the best starring vehicles he has been in so far . the acting from Lundgren is sometimes really really bad ( see the scene when he discovers his partners corpse ) but for most of the film he is very good . with great support from Benben , the pair have great chemistry together and share some great one liners . Baxley once again shows that he is very capable of making an exciting action film and makes great use of his cast and turns a pretty corny story into a very good movie . Hues is fantastic as the alien and probably because he isn't given very much to say . if you get all nostalgic about the late eighties early nineties action movies , then you should definitely check this out . very un PC , with a ridiculous soundtrack and great set-pieces , this is a classic .

After a ship sunk off the coast of Albania , the world's superpowers begin a feverish search for its valuable lost cargo : the powerful ATAC system , which will give its bearer unlimited control over Polaris nuclear submarines . As Bond joins the search , he suspects the suave Kristatos of seizing the device . The competition between nations grows more deadly by the moment , but Bond finds an ally in the beautiful Melina Havelock , who blames Kristatos for the death of her parents . . . . . a back to basics bond after the fun and frolics of ' Moonraker ' and ' the spy who loved me ' . this features some great skiing , Ariel shots and some amazing cinematography . although after watching the previous two , this can become a little tiresome in some places , but keeping faithful to the short story and borrowing from other Fleming source material , there is a lot to be gained from this bond outing . heavily referencing ' on her majesty's secret service ' in the pre-credits sequence , Bond at his wife's grave side and his final confrontation with his nemesis ( allegedly ) ' Blofeld ' , this is great to watch after Lazenbys outing , but the pre credits sequence does feel like it is from another movie . Moores most serious Bond film out of his seven outings , this has limited gadgets and Henchman , but still keeps a little of the tongue-in-cheek and one liners that made Moore's Bond his own . with some great support from Glover and Topol , the story is really good and the narrative carries the set pieces smoothly . one set piece that stands out is the skiing scene which involves the bobsleigh and Moore and even a young Charles Dance . a great film if not the most exciting , this is a really personal Bond film and one that stays very faithful to Flemings material . a must see
538196	3717154	54269	9.0	it's a hard life if you don't weaken .	the film follows the life of Arthur Seaton , a Nottingham working class jack the lad , who goes through the week doing his mundane job and spends the weekend down the boozer spending all of his hard earned . you can tell that Arthur is fed up with this sort of life , through his narration and all of the ' antics ' he gets up to during the duration of the film . Arthur is having a fling with one of his work colleagues wives , Brenda and they become pregnant . not having any of this , Arthur seeks help from his aunt Ada , who tries but fails to abort the unborn child . when Brendas husband finds out , Arthur is beaten up by his two brothers , and Brenda and her husband decide to bring the baby up as their own . another sub-plot in this film involves Arhturs more happier courtship with young Doreen , a shy girl who takes a fancy to Arthurs ' boyish ways . she is the total mirror image of Arthur , not liking to drink and doing as her mum tells her too , but Arthur warms to this , and supposedly they get married and live happily ever after . this film works on two different forms of narrative and story . Arhturs dark side ( his affair with Brenda ) and his light happy side ( hi romance with Doreen ) . each of these blend seamlessly with each other as Arhtur goes about his business in 1960 Nottingham . his narration goes somewhere along the line of ' i'm destined for better things and i will make something of myself ' a dream that many a working class person has thought but has never done anything about it . this is evident at the end of the movie when Arhtur and Doreen are overlooking a building sight and Arthur realises that he will just have to settle with being another nobody . a great film about working class people with some very sharp dialogue and a bravura performance from Albert Finney . this film still feels as fresh and controversial as it did back in the sixties . by no means a depressing film , this actually makes you realise how good people had it ' in the old days ' and how we suffer today . in the old clich√© , ' you could go out and leave your back door open ' is evident in much of this film as their is no real sense of danger in Arthuers world as he is just a normal working class man in his twenties with dreams of something better , and he sticks a great big middle finger up to society and the pressures of everyday life . a film for anyone who has worked a hard day in their life , and a great showcase of British cinema

After some of the missionaries are taken prisoner by sadistic Burmese soldiers , Rambo gets a second impossible job : to assemble a team of mercenaries to rescue the surviving relief workers . . . Stallone has again resurrected one of his best loved characters and rejuvenated them for the new millennium . this is an action movie that knows what action means , and it shows on screen , almost all the way through . the opening scene is as visceral as anything in ' saving private Ryan ' and Stallone makes a point of lingering on the pain and torture that these poor people have to go through on a daily basis . the best way to see this movie is to forget parts II and III ( even though there both good in there own right ) and remember Rambo as the angry young man who had everything against him in First Blood , as this is how is character is during the film . even though Stallone is in his sixties , he just about pulls off the job as the titular character , and is as broody as he was in the forest back in 1982 . though be warned , it is extremely violent , and if you saw the three minute preview posted on the net a while back , it's all here . but it's a great movie and at a very good running time and Stallone ends the movie Just as the first movie began . a must see for action , Stallone and especially Rambo fansit does not disappoint .

During the night , she meets a fairy who takes her to an old fawn in the centre of the labyrinth . He tells her she's a princess , but must prove her royalty by surviving three gruesome tasks . If she fails , she will never prove herself to be the the true princess and will never see her real father , the king , again . . . . an exquisite piece of cinema from Del Toro . nothing has been left to the imagination in layer upon layer of sumptuous story telling , brilliant use of mise ' en scene and cinematography and sets that will make the best Hollywood blockbusters cower in shame . the story is very easy to grasp , but very difficult to explain and the film contains some very graphic imagery , but this doesn't pale the films meaning and terrifying undertones . who is the fawn / is He merely a trick of Ofelia's imagination ? . or is he a reality ? ( debate could be held here , because the only other human who is present at the same time as the Fawm , is the captain , who at the same time is under the influence of medication and alcohol , so could he have missed him ? ) the three challenges are more gruelling to Ofelia as the film progresses and become more gruelling for the viewer . but which sub-plot is the most interesting to you ? is it the war backdrop with Ofelia having to come to terms with living with a monster for the rest of her life ? or is it Ofelia having to trust a potential monster for eternal life ? not all questions are answered , but the film is so innocent , yet so barbaric , that by the end you will make your own mind up . and the ending , which path do you choose ? the sweet ending where all is happy , or the bitter ending , where all is left cold . another great movie from Del Toro who knows how to tell a story , and get the best from his cast . exceptional .

But this schizophrenic situation and the drug-induced memory and concentration lapses put Robert under mounting stress . are you who you think you are ? that was the question going through my head after seeing this amazing movie . at last a movie that really makes you think about the point of this little thing we are involved in called life . should we be paranoid ? should we believe what the media tell us ? they say that people who are addicted to a drug are paranoid . but aren't we all paranoid and obsessive to an extent . this happens to Arctor as the film progresses , is the substance ' D ' making him paranoid , or is he just paranoid anyway . maybe a bit of both . his friends certainly don't help matters and then Robert starts to hallucinate in his weird and wonderful world . the film is almost flawless and the cast are perfect in their respected roles . Linklater has made the film possible using the same style he used for ' waking life ' . i cannot imagine another way to make this film possible . having never read the source material i wsn't sure what to expect , and although sometimes the film is a struggle , it does eventually ' come ' to you at the end . but at times the film makes you feel a little dirty and a little depressed . imagine Living the Life of Arctor and try not to feel a little depressed . friends who are losers hanging around you all day , making you paranoid and trying to get you into trouble . this film makes you feel guilty about addiction , whatever the addiction maybe . even the scene where Arctor is remembering ( possibly imagining ) his family , he takes a sip of beer , and i even felt bad that i had drank alcohol at all . a great film to watch , but keep an open mind and you may get something amazing . just expect to feel a little dirty after . an exceptional movie .

With the help of the ghosts of Christmas past , present and future , Frank realises he must change . . . a re-working of the Dickens classic , what Murray and Donner have done here is make ' Scrooge ' for the wall street generation . Murray shows one of his best performances here as Frank , and is absolutely hilarious , from his bitter venomous start , to his delusional middle , right down to the sentimental man we all knew he was at the end . even though the film is twenty years old , it still feels really fresh and new , and gets more laughs from me with each viewing . it can go from dark to light in an instant , which for some can be a very unsettling prospect , but it all makes sense in the end when frank breaks the fourth wall and tells the audience how he feels . it is truly tearjearking and one of the most heartwarming moments in cinema history . yes , it ; s schmaltzy , yes it's sickly sweet , but it's a Christmas movie , and probably one of the last great ones ever made . it never has a dull moment and sometimes it's just plain bizarre , which only adds goodness to the mixture . Lee Majors ? Bob Goulets old fashioned Cajun Christmas ? Father Loves Beaver ? Richard Pryor ? Brice Cummings ? the innocent window ? a fantastic movie , one that should be viewed every Christmas

But both James and Teresa find more than they ever bargained for when their paths collide in a vicious pursuit in the snow-capped mountains of Switzerland , an enormous avalanche , and a smuggling ring for germ warfare against the West by Blofeld . who proves most difficult to kill and who exacts a revenge that James can never forget - or forgive . . . . . best known as the only that starred Lazenby , it is easy to see why it is disliked ( supposedly ) by so many people , it is difficult to adjust to a new bond if you are watching the series in chronological order . but after the credits it soon passes by , and lazenby fits into the shoes of 007 very comfortably . he has great chemistry with Rigg on screen ( even though allegedly they hated each other off screen ) and Lazenby shows that bond can have a human side after all . the story is very good and keeps relatively faithful to the source material and Savalas brings in a good performance as nemesis Blofeld but doesn't shine as well as Peasence did in the previous movie . the final act is great and does leave you with a lump in your throat and a bitter taste in your mouth . it is shame that Lazenby didn't continue his stint as Bond as i would have loved to see what bond would have done to Blofeld in Lazenby form . one of the best Bond films in the series but very overlooked and unfairly treated when it was first released .

Ari is surprised that he can't remember a thing anymore about that period of his life . Intrigued by this riddle , he decides to meet and interview old friends and comrades around the world . He needs to discover the truth about that time and about himself . As Ari delves deeper and deeper into the mystery , his memory begins to creep up in surreal images . and surreal is the ideal word to summise this movie . it's such a bizarre feature that one cannot help but be in awe by the vivid images shown throughout the movie . it's technically amazing , a sort of ' a scanner darkly ' animation to it , but more gritty and with so much going on in the background , you have to watch it a second time . it's also disturbing to think that such an impacting part of someones life is just forgotten about , maybe the mind has to erase some bad things to help you to carry on . it's very difficult to watch at times , but well worth it .

On the way they meet several unusual characters . A rancher and his family , a hitchhiker and the hippie commune where he lives , hookers , red-necks , but most noticeably George Hansen . . . having not seen this film before , i had high hopes considering the movies cult status and icons it had made . to be honest it exceeded all these expectations . what we have here is on of the most pleasing viewing experiences you could ever have . this film is written and directed by people who have been through the experiences the two lead characters are going through , not wanting to settle down , not wanting to work , just wanting to be free . as the heading goes ' a man went looking for America , and couldn't find it anywhere ' . a lot of the script can relate to the characters , when Henson is talking about UFO's in Mexico , the next scene shows the three in a coffee shop being mocked , because they are clearly alien . this movie is so influential as well , the camera-work is great , some of the visuals are stunning , and it seems you are living in Wyatts ' world for parts of the movie . also the soundtrack adds enjoyment to the viewing pleasure and really relates to the story . their are connotations about religion , when they are ' high ' the leads almost become biblical in a sense , as they make quotes , and make very stark and important focuses on life . the two leads are great , Nicholson is outstanding , and knowing that they smoked pot for real on screen is another pleasure . some say that there is a homosexual element to it , that Fonda is Hoppers whore as Fonda is the ' easy rider ' of the title . i myself cannot see this , they are both easy riders , and the world is their whore . endlessly quotable , and demanding multiple viewings , this could be on of the most important films made in the sixties . if you have not seen this , i urge you to see it .

Her father stores drugs for two-faced cop Norman Stansfield . Only her little brother keeps Mathilda from breaking apart . One day , Stansfield and his team take cruel revenge on her father for stretching the drugs a little , killing the whole family . Only Mathilda , who was out shopping , survives by finding shelter in L√©on's apartment in the moment of highest need . Soon , she finds out about the strange neighbour's unusual profession - ' cleaning ' - and desperately seeks his help in taking revenge for her little brother . L√©on , who is completely unexperienced in fatherly tasks , and in friendships , does his best to keep Mathilda out of trouble - unsuccessfully . Now , the conflict between a killer , who slowly discovers his abilities to live , to feel , to love and a corrupt police officer , who does anything in his might to get rid of an eye witness , arises to unmeasurable proportions - all for the sake of a little twelve-year old girl , who has nearly nothing to lose . . . with its sympathetic characters , sparkling script , mesmerising cinematography and three wonderful career best performances , Leon is one of the most perfect films ever made . if you have to see on version though , see the international uncut version , it really expands on the relationship between Leon and Mathilda , even if it does sometimes make for un-easy viewing . but the relationship between the two is absolutely innocent though , Leon is a father figure to Mathilda and Leon is very innocent and childlike himself , entrusting himself to Aiello and reluctantly taking in someone , who will eventually change his life forever , making him realise that he doesn't have to sleep ' with one eye open ' . the film is sometimes very funny , and the set pieces are stunning , especially considering that this is a very low budget move . Oldman overplays his role but he is at his maniacal best and will probably always be remembered as the bad guy . he almost usurps Rickman in Die hard as best screen villain ever ( in my opinion ) . a beautiful film to watch over and over again , absolutely stunning and emotionally charged throughout . Maybe Bessons best work ever .

Eastwood plays Walt Kowalski , a bitter lonely man , who has just lost his beloved wife and has new neighbours moving in . the fact that the neighbours are Korean , irks Walt as , he was in the Korean war , and lost several of his friends . things start to change for him though when one of the neighbours , Thao tries to steal the titular vehicle , and Walt catches him , but he finds out it was an initiation to join his cousins gang , and Thao was reluctant to do this act . when Walt sticks up for Thao , they form a bond , one which Walt would never thought would happen . . . . . Forget what you have read about this being a potential Harry Callahan sub-project , this is so much more than that ( not criticising those movies though ) . this is a movie about redemption and trying to come to terms with loss , and being the cause of loss . Eastwood proves yet again , that he is a master of storytelling , music , and knowing when to shock an audience . the film is very laid back throughout , so when you see the little outbursts of violence , it does shock you , but i feel that this is Eastwoods intentions , as are the admittedly funny moments , sometimes laugh out loud moments , which mix really well with the narrative . it's a blunt movie at times , with the banter between the men in bar scenes and when Eastwood squares up to the younger generation , but one cannot deny the fact of how powerful the final act is . In my opinion , this is Eastwoods best starring and directing job since ' Unforgiven ' . it has a lot of emotion and although i thought the movie finished swiftly , i found myself sitting through the credits until the very end . without giving too much away , this could be Eastwood subliminally telling his audience that he is retiring as an actor , if he is , thats a big shame , but what a high to go out on . this is definitely one of the best films of the year . a must see . .
