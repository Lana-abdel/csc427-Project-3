Bill and Ted did this thing much better over ten years earlier than this and did it with a lot more panache . i gave the movie a chance and watched it all the way through , and i am not exaggerating when i say that this has to be one of the worst movies ever made , and i have seen some drivel in my movie watching life . and what makes it worse is the fact that this film was moderately successful and that some people actually enjoy this movie . it has a silly story , annoying stereotypical characters and is very sexist to say the least . don't get me wrong , i do enjoy movies such as road trip , American pie , and even Freddy got fingered , but they at least had a little bit of charm and even humour to them . this is plain wrong and worthless , please avoid , or more like this will be made . scarily bad

The two cousins become addicted in death , initially killing prostitutes and then attacking single women , dumping their bodies on the hill . . . . in the same vein as the Bundy movie a few years prior to this , comes another virtually unwatchable movie , starring an actor who should know better . i don't know whether it's the directors and writers intention to make a dirty feeling exploitation film , but you do feel disgusting after watching this . the script is poor the camera-work and editing dodgy , and the performances way over the top . again maybe intended by the filmmakers , the main protagonists are only violent toward women and appeared afraid of men , which makes you Even more angry whilst watching the movie . another bad film about a subject that should have been left well alone . for a better film about a serial killer see ' summer of Sam '

Karen Mcann is organising her daughters birthday party . living a normal life with her husband and two children , she enjoys a simple and happy life . tragedy strikes when Jack Bauer sexually assaults and murders her eldest daughter Julie . unable to cope with the tragedy , Karen attends a self help group and tries to come to terms with the unruly justice that was served when the killer was set free after the farce of a trial . within the group , their are vigilantes who help the grieving parents . Karen seeks their help and decides to take justice into her own hands . the calibre of the cast is amazing . Mantegna , Harris , Baker-Hall , David and Sutherland . and with a director such as John Schlesinger , this should have been a drama of high quality and tension . but what we have here is a farcical film , which makes the subject very laughable and sometimes very offensive . the script is awful and the actors involved seem to have no motivation at all . Sally Field is the worse offender of all . plying a parent who has lost her daughter to this terrible crime , she never ever shows the emotion that on would expect . mainly through the film , she is all smiles and sparkly eyes , and this takes the films story right out of the back door and dumps it in the waste . Harris looks very bored in his role and is given very little to do , and wastes his time in this drivel . some of the worst parts of this movie are : when the aunt slips on the toy truck and has Karen in fits of laughter in the toilet . when Karen attacks a man in the car park for no reason . the script . it stinks pure and simple . the only redeeming thing about this is Kiefer Sutherland . hardly in the film , he plays a very convincing villain and makes the movie . . . . just . the ending is very predictable , and once Mantegna gives away a critical law lesson to Field , you just know what is going to happen . obviously inspired by the much superior ' death wish ' this is a film that should be seen , but only to see just how bad prolific actors can be . this would have been a one for me , but Sutherland gives it an extra point . really bad and offensive . and unintentionally funny in parts .

Together they become the last hope of Earth against the evil mutants . . . a movie that is a hybrid of Saving Private Ryan , Doom , Pitch Black , All Quiet On The Western Front , Starship Troopers and The Descent , is an abysmal attempt to make an action sci-fi hybrid that will quench the thirst of video game fans . it fails on all accounts . everybody involved just looks lost in the proceedings and the effects have that Sky Captain feel to it . it's gory and there are a lot of set pieces , but none of them actually get the adrenaline rushing .

Shrouded within a supernatural fog , the ghosts trap the residents of the remote community , intent on seeking out the descendants of those who founded the town . . . and killing anyone who stands in their murderous path . . . . . well , well , another year , another pointless remake . and this even had Carpenter producing the project . if this was in the right hands ( and it was , with Carpenter ) it could have been an adequate horror film . but instead we get another family friendly horror with minimal gore and silly shock scenes with the screechy soundtrack . its all been done before , much better and really is a pointless 90 minutes of your life wasted . i found myself actually pressing my search button on the DVD remote at times because it was becoming boring . cgi again ruins a film and makes it less thrillinmg . if you want to see a good film , then see the original . it is more claustrophobic , chilling and with a much clearer narrative . avoid .

Tim Allen appears to e on auto pilot for the majority of the film and has something cocky to say to every syllable that is uttered to him , ehich is really painful considering the script is so bad . Chase looks embarrassed to be involved in the movie and looks like he is just thinking about what he could spend his paycheck on ( probably looking for a new agent ) . but the worse to come out of this is Cox , who is just plain awful , and may find it difficult to continue to be the second most successful one from friends ( scream was a hit , but that was ten years ago ) and plays the Julianne Moore card ala ' Evolution by falling over every other minute for laughs . it doesn't work . all in all a plain , boring movie , which doesn't help by an unfunny script and uninvolved characters .

Skarsgard sounds like he is doing his best Batman impersonation and George just hangs around the film looking grumpy . the only person in my opinion to come out of this with any dignity is Ashley waters , because he actually looks like hes making an effort . a ' waz'te of time . but that's my opinion . . .

Philip Marlowe is asked by the elderly ( and near death ) General Sternwood to investigate an attempt at blackmail on one of his daughters . He soon finds that the attempt is half hearted at best and seems to be more connected with the disappearance of the other daughter's husband , Rusty Regan . Rusty's wife , seems unconcerned with his disappearance , further complicating the mystery . Only General Sternwood seems concerned as mobsters and hired killers continue to appear in the path of the investigation . . . the film stays mostly true to Chandlers book , although the action is switched to good old Blighty rather than the States . in 1978 , this must have been a dream project for Winner , having an all star cast agreeing to star in such a grand project . the outcome though is less than grand . Winner should stick with directing vigilante movies , starring in insurance ads and wooing younger women , as his direction here is very poor , and doesn't do the story justice . the cast are fine , apart from Candy Clark , who should stay off the E numbers from now . some scenes though are sensational . the Mitchum and Stewart scenes are to die for and as always , oliver Reed is simply divine . but the film is boring , ludicrous and bloated , a lot like the director .
538331	3717154	800039	4.0	are those sad tissues , or happy tissues ? . . .	the film is one of the new ' gross out comedies , that doesn't really want to be gross out , as it hasn't got many gross out bits in it , but it's trying to be a little like porky's and animal house , but is more like American pie for adults , with a bit more maturity in it ' movies that has been released in the last couple of years . the basic premise is that a slob get's ditched by his really hot famous girlfriend and she's seeing a really annoying famous celebrity now . he cannot take it so he goes to Hawaii to forget about it and guess what ? they are there , and he has to put up with all their antics in his face . but it's all okay , because he meets a few zany people along the way and meets a hot girl , who finds him attractive . . . with hilarious results . this is really scraping the comedy barrel , after the success of knocked up and the 40 year old virgin and superbad , i was really looking forward to this , because the writers had the potential to be really evil on people who had just been dumped by their loved one . what they have squandered in a really good potential , is make the protagonist so unsympathetic and so , so pathetic , that you do not really care for him , to the extent that you actually think the guy deserves it . i didn't laugh once through the film , the jokes are re-hashes of better ones from even better movies , and none of the carachters are really worth bothering about . if you want to watch a film about a slob who spends the majority of a film getting drunk and feeling sorry for himself , then this is for you . if you want to laugh , see another Apatow comedy .

After driving her car at a speed of 110 mph whilst getting it on with football star Kevin Franks , Trammel manages to crash her car into the ( maybe ) Thames , without anyone seeing her or hearing the incident . after Franks dies in the accident , she is prime suspect in his death , as he was overdosed on a drug and ' wasn't breathing when the car hit the water ' . Tramell is psycho-analysed by Dr . Glass who believes that she suffers from the common disease known as ' risk addiction ' , which basically means that she spends her time talking very slowly and seductive , and includes at least one sexual innuendo in every sentence . obviously Glass becomes obsessed with her , and buys her books and fantasises about her when he is having sex . but then people close to him start to die in suspicious circumstances and he becomes a suspect as well as Tramell . will Glass be able to prove that Tramell is the killer ? or is it the alleged detective Washburn who is the crooked one ? or is Tramell really innocent and is Glass really the killer ? or is this just an excuse to cash in on a successful film made over twelve years ago ? Stone has aged well but the story hasn't . i do not know what Caton-Jones was thinking when he started to make this , but his is just a rehash of the original , but switched to a knew locale . the problem is the story . it is just too clever for it's own good and become muddled in its own ego . if it was kept simple like it's predecessor , then it might have been more of a guilty pleasure , but it becomes tiresome very quickly . everyone does fine in their acting roles with the exception of Stone , who like Hopkins in ' Hannibal ' , has made the role that she is best known for a caricature of the original , and it seems very camp too . when ever she makes a statement about something she sounds like she belongs in carry on movie . and the sequel borrows heavily from the original . eg . characters from the original ( Nick Curran , Johnny Boz ) are mentioned and characters from the original are contacted along the way . even set pieces are reused in this . but it isn't as bad as the critics made it out to be . London is used to good effect and there are some hilarious references to the Phallus . also the ending is quite downbeat and depressing , which makes a change . but it is still horrific compared to the original , and will be up there with the turkeys of the year .

His gorgeous neighbour and super of the building , Charlotte , feels attracted for him , but the deranged Ben starts seeing his dead wife and is investigated by Detective Constable Jackson as a suspect of murdering Lauren Parris . . . . if you have the time or the patience to watch this movie more than once , you may get the jist of what is happening during the third act . not really enjoying the movie the first time , didn't give me the patience . it's quite a hard film to follow , and tries too hard to be clever . Evans cemented his reputation as a good film maker with ' My Little Eye ' which was a very taut and exciting spin on the Big Brother phenomenon . here , he sort of riffs on Argento movies of the seventies , and really makes a mess , despite a good performance from Firth and Suvari . the characters are uninteresting and not really likable , and it doesn't really leave you in suspense at any given time , so it just trudges with subliminal imagery and hallucinations for the second act . very disappointing stuff .

Dale now has another reason to visit Saul : to find out if the weed is so rare that it can be traced back to him - - and it is . As Dale and Saul run for their lives , they quickly discover that they're not suffering from weed-fuelled paranoia : incredibly , the bad guys really are hot on their trail and trying to figure out the fastest way to kill them both . . . . . Seth Rogen was great in Knocked Up and Superbad , but compared to those two movies , this is fairly mundane . James Franco is amazing as Sol , and shows that he has potential to be a star in comedy . it really harks back to the likes of midnight run , and fast times at ridgemont high , but the stoner jokes do come fast , but are never that funny . the story has been duplicated endlessly , and having the weed connection is a good idea , but it doesn't pay off in the end . there are some kooky characters who raise a few laughs , but it seems to go on forever and it feels rather bloated toward the end .

C musical in the history of movies . they accumulate the money by conning old women and seducing them for cheques . but lo and behold the musical was a success and they land themselves in big trouble . well , having just sat through this i have a feeling that this was a little ironic . was the filmmaker trying to make the film a little like ' springtime for Hitler ' ? . Matthew Broderick and Nathan Lane are fine in their roles , but the transition from screen to stage back to screen is complicated and messy as the sentence itself . Will Ferral is plain embarrassing in his role as the scriptwriter and should start to choose his roles carefully . having not seen the original or the west end version i really have nothing to back up my opinion . but at the end of the day , it is my opinion . not a bad film , the production value is very good and so is the choreography , but the film failed to inspire me . not bad just , bland .

Realizing this is the work of the Tall Man , they venture inside armed heavily . But the Tall Man still has his deadly flying spheres - and a couple of cronies who will stop at nothing to keep their evil plans a secret . . . . in this sequel to the original classic , director Coscarelli has gone all evil dead and all out action , which kind of ruins the whole proceedings . gone are the bizarre images , the nightmarish scenes and set pieces , in we get more laughs , more gore and more spheres . the on saving grace is that the film does carry on from the original and there is a little catch up for those who cannot remember the original . but the sets are not as prominent and Gothic and the effects rely more on splatter than stunning . there is still a little fun to be had though with the spheres different utilities and inventive deaths , but it feels like the makers were just cashing in on a great movie to stand proud with the other gore-fests released in the late eighties . disappointing .

Frankly because the film is hilarious . it throws logic straight out of the window , and seeing such a screen great like John Hurt utter lines such as ' phone the police . . . the numbers 999 ' is such a joy to watch . the red herrings , that are so blatant that if some one was holding a sign saying ' the bleeding obvious ' wouldn't appear out of context in this film . Elijah Wood drinking a pint and trying to convince as a romeo is such fun to laugh at , the pointless cameo by Alex Cox , ballbag n ' all , it's car crash cinema at it's best . i still cannot decide if this is a comedy , because nothing makes sense throughout the film and i was astounded by just how much i enjoyed such a piece of trash . watch it , laugh and then be disgusted with yourself . .

Mike Myers latest comedy is getting universally panned , and with the story and some bad editing clearly showing that the film has been cut , it's understandable . it suffers from the same fate as Goldmember did , Myers is clearly having too much fun making the film , putting in jokes that he finds funny and that will make him laugh , to really care about what the audience will think . this could be due to arrogance , thinking that his other franchises brought in the cash , so adding a few penis , fart , and sight gags , would earn the film cash . or maybe it's because he thinks that there is a little immature person in all of us that will think some of the jokes would stick , a few do , Ben Kingsley does raise a smile or too , and some of it is so bizarre , you cannot help but laugh at the silliness of it all . it starts off well , the first ten or so minutes are quite enjoyable , but then it soon turns in to the Mike Myers laugh in show . the musical interludes do not work in this movie , Alba and Timberlake prove that they are just pretty faces , and for some reason , the whole film feels like a poor mans dodgeball . still the Cameos are funny , the Waynes world reference is quite clever , and the bar fight is diverting . so it's not as bad as what the critics say , but compared to his other movies , it's a travesty . probably it's the wake up call that Myers needs , not everyone has the same sense of humour as you , remember this every time you see this movie in the bargain bin if your local media store , right next to the cat in the hat . . .

Stallone does well at self parody , and Snipes is in his best role since Nino Brown in 1991's ' New Jack City ' . predictably produced by Joel Silver , this has all the explosions and action we expect from the man who produced the original ' Die Hard ' and ' Lethal Weapon ' . some parts of the film do disappoint though . there is no real detail about Learys ' character and Stallone does ham it up a little . but this is brainless fun with a great original storey and great support from Bullock , Hawthorne , Schneider , and Bratt . leave your brain at the door , and have some fun . .
538332	3717154	795421	6.0	you shady lady ! ! ! . . . .	Set on a colourful Greek island , the plot serves as a background for a wealth of great ABBA songs which are used in remarkably appropriate ways . A young woman about to be married discovers that any one of three men could be her father . She invites all three to the wedding without telling her mother , Donna , who was once the lead singer of Donna and the Dynamos . In the meantime , Donna has invited her backup singers , Rosie and Tanya . . . i had no intentions of seeing this movie , and the fact that Firth , Brosnan and Skarsgard , were all singing , did not appeal to me in the slightest . the synopsis is vomit inducing , and the whole air of the proceedings wreaked of ' cheese ' and ' ham ' . so i'm asking myself , why oh why did i enjoy the damned thing so much ? it's a colourful romp , with plenty of laughs and some one in the film that everyone could relate to , and funnily enough the story is quite endearing too . as is the singing . fair enough , not everyone will have a future in the pop industry ( Mr . Brosnan please stand up ) , but it all goes along in such a bright and breezy manner , that you will find it hard to stop your feet tapping , even if you are not a fan of ABBA . the sets are not the best , and some of the editing could be improved , but all in all , this is a very god musical , the second best of the year in fact .

When his brother , Memphis , once a great car thief , who retired a few years ago , learns of this , he comes back to town to see if he can help his brother . The only thing that will appease Calitri is if the order is fulfilled . So Memphis has to assemble his old crew , and he has to do the job in a few days . And a cop who hounded him , upon learning of his return , is keeping an eye on him . And another car thief , whom he competed with before wants to get the Calitri job , and is telling Memphis to back off , but he won't . . . after the double whammy of The Rock and Con Air , it was obvious that Cage would stand tall again with Bruckheimer . and while the film is still watchable , you can really tell that the film was rushed and that no real love has been put into it . saying that the cast work well with the script that they were handed and there are some funny scenes and even some very pathetic indeed ( the car jump at the end is very cheesy and cringeworthy ) . Ecclesston does his best as the villain , but there is not enough backstory to his character to make him evil or interesting . the scene near the climax where Cage says to Eccleston ' you've got a thing about wood ' is quite bizarre , though i guess they saved that for the directors cut , which i won't be conned into buying . saying that it's still worth the watch , even if it is mindless rubbish .

But Mother Nature , in the form of a series of intense storms sweeping across Oklahoma , has other plans . Soon the three have joined the team of storm chasers as they attempt to insert a revolutionary measuring device into the very heart of several extremely violent tornadoes . . . . a brash silly big film with nothing to scream about but it's intense effects and way over the top performances from such talent , but it's two hours of silly throwaway fun that some critic , somewhere has bound to have written ' it'll blow you away ! ! ' and laugh at you when you spent your money to watch it on the big screen . it loses a lot on the small screen , and unless you have a good surround sound system and a decent size television , this is cinematic pap , but it's funny and the effects are good . it's just an event movie , from that little era in the nineties when disaster movies came back in fashion for a while and Jan de Bont movies were not that bad .

Finding themselves in a high-stakes chase across the globe , their relentless tenacity puts their own lives at risk as the bank will stop at nothing - even murder - to continue financing terror and war . . . answers on a postcard to me please , if anyone has any idea what this movie has to do with anything apart from building up to a spectacular shoot out , and Owen proving again he could have been quite a good Bond . he spends all of this film looking moody ( he has a past of course ) and Watts does nothing in this film apart from receiving text messages saying no , and having the phone hung up on her . it's a good looking film , but very shallow . the acting is good and the story has a very good potential to it , but come the closing credits , you maybe like me and be scratching your head about the previous 110 minutes . worth watching for the shoot-out , which is expertly done , but coming from such a prolific director , i was expecting a whole lot more , even the trailers were a cop out . . .

Ohio's Central State University marching band makes the trip and kicks off the festivities at the intersection of Quincy and Downing Streets . . . block party , or Dave Chapelles vanity project . this isn't really about giving the people a good time on a rainy night , this is about Dave chapelle showing the people how much money he has and how many people he knows . a lot of you may disagree with what i say , and thats fair enough , but watch the movie again and count how many times he goes on about his fortune , and see him standing numerous times on the roof with his loudspeaker , acting like a god , it does start to grate after a while . on the plus side , we have some great footage by Gondry and some great performances from the artists , and a little of it is funny ( apart from the really old racist jokes , enough with the white jokes , philistine ! ! ! ) , but as i said before , pure vanity . cannot wait for the Chris rock project .

But when Payne is recalled to fight in Bosnia , will he leave the corp who has just started the believe in him , or will he find out that killin ' ain't much of a livin ' ? . . . it's an easy story to follow , teacher is hated by pupils , starts to get respect from pupils , has a chance to go back to doing what he does best , declines and saves the day , it's that simple , but Wayans screenplay just makes Payne that little more despicable , yet lovable . the film depends on Payne and his one-liners , and the man is full of them , most of them being very un-PC , which could put a lot of people off , but it never really gets too out of hand . it's simple and straight forward , but fun for all the family , and it's also amazing how Wayans can actually convince the kids he's a killing machine with such a silly accent . forgettable , predictable , but funny .

Tess starts to copy Holly by wearing her clothes and even dyeing her hair to look the same , but thats not all , Tess is hiding a big secret that could be the death of Holly , and it's not the fact that she is a nurse killing patients , or the fact that she keeps a locket with both their pictures in it . . . . well this is just a remake of the 1992 movie of the same name , but with a much lower budget , and younger actors taking the lead . the story and plot outlines are a carbon copy of the original , even down to the hair dyeing sequence . the two leads are not bad in this , and Kristen miller is very good in her performance and holds the movie well . it's just the fact that for the other characters , you couldn't care less if they lived or died , and you are supposed to be intrigued with a thriller . sometimes the film is boring and then in the next instant it is totally insane , and the story is sometimes very , very stupid . but with all these direct to DVD sequels , it is just pure filler and is a quick cash in for people who liked the original . lie 8mm2 and American psycho 2 this does tarnish the original and really could have been released alone without the sequel tag-line . and the sequel subtitle . . . the psycho , just really states the obvious . not a bad film , just boring .

Heder plays his usual nerdy self and uses it to good effect , but Thornton steals the show completely from everybody involved . he is razor sharp with his timing , and this sort of role suits him down to a tee . the twist at the end is obvious and it can be slow in places , but you will have some fun whilst watching . and Ben Stillers cameo is hilarious .

Can Jian protect Jessica , rescue her daughter , and give Richard the kiss of the dragon ? another Western movie from Li features the producing talents of Besson , makes for an enjoyable action movie , but with more of an adult theme to it . Li is great in his role , saying very little , but using his physical techniques to the extreme . the fight scenes are truly awesome and although over top in some places , are really pleasing on the eye . Besson has produced more and more extremely ridiculous movies as the years have progressed , but this is really something .

At the same time a man strongly resembling the mythical Jake the Mid-Folker is closing in . An overwhelming sense of impending horror surrounds the house , but is the enemy outside - or is the enemy within ? . . . this film really has to be viewed more than once , to actually understand the entire concept , of mythology and how it can influence a youngsters mind . the main protagonist here is Brian , mentally tortured by his sister all them years , growing up with her stories and only having her to depend on as the rest of the family were arguing or being nasty to him , then she just ups and leaves . when she returns , Brian is really a tortured soul now , but a few red herrings draw us away from this , and although the movie is very good , there are several plot holes that go unanswered , but this can all be forgiven for such visceral imagery . heavily influenced by the shining in the final act , the toybox is a great British movie which will soon become a cult . see it .

Finally in the mountainous region they want to be , they continue despite a serious falling out between the two couples , one couple is serious about their investigation the other is there for some fun , fun that sees them defile a native burial ground . . . . if this was made a decade ago , it would have been something else , it would have been classed as innovative , original , and taut . now , after the aftermath of a certain witch , moviegoers are used to this sort of ' guerrila ' film making . thats not to say the film is bad , the cast are okay with what they are given , and there are a few uneasy scenes in the film , the standout scenes are the ones with the natives just watching the couples while they are drifting on their home made rafts . there isn't anything original about though , which is a shame , but there is a lot of fun to be had , because you know what will happen to the quartet and the final 15 minutes are quite spectacular . it's been slated by a lot of users on this site , but if you haven't already seen this , put yourself in the characters shoes , you will see the film in a different light . worth watching

A search of the star charts reveals that they are completely lost in an uncharted sector of space but this is only the beginning of their problems . . . for all the effects that are thrown on to the screen in this movie adaption , it cannot mask the lack of story or narrative in the actual movie . the bottom line is , it's just an event movie , with a good cast and Gary Oldman as the ever faithful cheesy bad guy . he steals the show from anyone who dare share the screen with him , and is the best thing in the whole thing , even though he has some awful dialogue . a lot of it doesn't make sense , but for the kids , there's a cute little alien , and for the girls Joey from friends has become all macho . for everyone else , there's William Hurt and the aforementioned effects , which are very impressive . it's watchable , but but empty at the same time . on the plus side , the end credits are one of the best i have ever seen , and even though it leaves us with the fact that the makers were hoping that this would make enough money for it to to green-light a sequel , it doesn't spoil the spectacle . the cinema equivalent of watching a friend play a video game .

Manhattan does look very cool in this movie and although Emmerich does destroy most of it ( like in all his other movies ) does make the city a character in itself . with some great movie references and some genuinely funny moments involving alienation and jean Reno , this is no where near as bad as the reception it received when first released and is a lot of fun to watch . it's a shame it doesn't have the heart a the original ' gojira ' movies . but a fun movie all the same .

You don't even have to chew it . . . . .	with the starring power of Romano and James , and their comic talents in ' Everybody loves Raymond ' and ' The King of Queens ' , i had to see this movie . i wasn't disappointed with their respective roles and they where well supported by the likes of Reynolds , Rappaport , Lewis , and Coates , but what makes this film a little bit weak , is the story . the two leads play meat salesman who are failing to close a deal . when one potential buyer gets a call from one of her friends , they become mixed up with Mafia hits and the execution of the prolific Mr Goldbluth . but it's the running time . at only 75 minutes long , the film takes the build up to the finale too slowly and by that time , the final third just happens too quickly , you are wondering what happened . but some of the script is tight , it is very amusing in parts ( especially the desperation the pair show , trying to close deals at gunpoint , and even before informing people about their impending danger ) . but the two leads could have done with more ' meat ' to their back-story . James has problems with his daughter , and we never really find out what the deal is here , we also learn that Romano , is a bit of a Ladies man , but not enough . Reynolds part is no more than an extended cameo , but plays his role very well . it's a shame that the movie wasn't released theatrically , as i imagine it would have done quite well in the states ( i doubt it would have done well in the UK ) , as the film has a very glossy feel to it , is well produced , and sometimes gives you a ' summer ' vibe at times . also the soundtrack is very good , and used to good effect . not the best film out there , but if you are a fan of the two leads , it is better than the recent roles they have played on the big screen .

Bacon does a great job as their grieving father , part Paul Kersey , part Travis Bickle , and half way through the film , we are treated to a ' mini-twist ' , the tables are turned , as he is the one who is hunted for revenge . by the director of ' Saw ' , if you are expecting something in that vein , ala ' plenty of gore , you will be disappointed , it doesn't get very violent until the final act , but what we get is another great performance from a great actor who proves that he is very versatile . it won't be remembered for much , and their some scenes and lines that you have to take a pinch of salt with , but if you want something in the vein of Death wish , the this is a good option .

Bruce learns this the hard way after his hometown is thrown into turmoil following an incident with the lottery thanks to Bruces ' actions as God . a great movie , Carrey should keep making films like this .

Is the Scorpion King so powerful that he cannot be defeated , and he himself will raise the Army for global victory ? this sequel was never going to live up to the first instalment , but it does have it's moments . the director obviously knows what the audience found exciting in the original , so he implements a lot of the elements of that one in here . the film is a lot bigger than the first one , yet this one tries and caters for the family , by the inclusion of the annoying child , and having a wrestler in a bad guy role . Fraser does his beast Indiana Jones impression , and it sails along nicely , until the final set piece where Fraser and Vosloo fight the worst piece of CGI ever committed to film . it's loud throwaway summer popcorn fluff , instantly forgettable . one of those movies that when you watch it a second time , you wonder what all the fuss was about .
538399	3717154	456554	7.0	drive monkey , drive	if are even thinking about renting this movie out , you must be sure that you know that this is a ' Happy Madison ' production , AKA , it had some input from Adam Sandler , then you'll know what to expect . this was the sole reason that i rented this movie out , because once in a while , it doesn't hurt to watch a film that has been criticised by the mass media , but hasn't been advertised to hell , to reap a little profit ( also known as ' epic movie ' ) . i was pleasantly surprised to find that this is another in a long line of funny , because it's so random movies that actually turned out to be a lot more than sight gags and fart noises . the main characters were likable and quite ' normal ' , and with all Sandler produced movies , there are some really gross bits , and some plain stupid bits , but like i aid before , if you like this kind of movie , you won't care what the media has to say about it . the plot is silly enough , a guy gets chucked out of his apartment and has to stay with his grandma who gets stoned with his stash , and then a pretty girl comes to work at his place and really thats all what happens for the first hour , people getting stoned , swearing a lot and playing video games , a real geeks film . expect media and film students to turn their noses up at films like this , but really enjoy it deep , deep , down . remember , it's not a crime to enjoy a dumb comedy once in a while ! with cameos from Rob Schneider and David Spade , it may not make you laugh out loud , but it will leave you smiling .

" after watching ' baywatch ' in his hotel room , Borat becomes more interested in locating and marrying Pamela Anderson than on his assignment , and meets weird and ( sometimes wonderful ) people on his trail of obsession . . . . what Cohen has done here is pure genius . not only has he made a very funny film with some very funny pokes at America , but he seamlessly puts an interesting story in this documentary . the only thing i can say about Cohen is , the man has a lot of guts . along with his racist , anti - semitist , religious and sexist digs , he sometimes does put himself at risk of being assaulted by members of the public . for example , when he is on the subway at the beginning and is threatened by a patron . when he sings the Kazakhstan national anthem to the theme of the USA national anthemwhen he has a naked fight with his producerand when he tries to kidnap Pamela Anderson . after seeing this , the guys from Jackass have a lot to live up to . this is truly gob smacking stuff , with Cohen really breaking the taboo on what can be said and what cannot be . the dinner party scene for example , not only does he insult the guests by calling them retarded and ugly , and bringing a bag of faeces to the table , BUT ! ! ! he invites a prostitute to the party . Gulp ! ! ! there are some scenes that just are simply bad and you feel guilty for laughing , like when he spends the night with the Jewish couple and then run away in the middle of the night . but maybe thats Cohen trying to make us feel guilty for laughing . where the film does fail though is the seen it all before routine . several of the skits he has done on his previous show , and the film has been over hyped a lot . but it still is one of the funniest films in recent history with real genius and does show just how shallow some members of the public can be , and what ignorant opinions they have ( the frat boys , the rodeo guy ) . a film to laugh at and to dissect after . a good , but over rated film .

This is compounded by the continual racist harassment by the Japanese population in the area . Unlike his friends , he confronts it head on with his mastery of martial arts while investigating his teacher's murder . just a typical revenge movie , but with the added gravitas of Bruce Lee in his prime . the story is paltry and simple , as are the sets and the hairstyles , but when it come to the fight choreography , it's second to none . it does take a while to get going , but when it does , you will realise why Lee is such a legend today . a great movie .

When Gus ' synthetic Kryptonite fails to kill Superman , it turns him in an evil incarnation of his former self . The tar-laced Kryptonite pits man against himself , setting up the Clark vs . Superman battle . . . . this is the point of the original series when it turned itself into a parody , but not that it ' s a bad thing . the opening sequence is hilarious with the blind man and the man drowning , but watching movies like ' the donner cut ' kinds of makes this film a little too parodical . but the standout scene in this is the second act when Reeve turns bad . Reeve makes an amazing transformation , as we were all used by now to seeing him as the all-American nice guy who would do anything for anyone . but him as ' bad superman ' darker costume and all , has to be up there with the ' zod battle ' in II , to be a standout sequence in the series . but really that is really all that is good about the film . the plot is basically a rip-off of a James bond film , and it feels as if the movie was made a Richard Pryor vehicle ( even though he is funny in this movie ) . the final act featuring the ' super-computer ' is absurd and the robot , beggars belief . but then this is the world of Superman , and anything can happen . even a fourth can be made !
538368	3717154	110678	8.0	don't ever turn your back on me again . . . .	The year is 2022 , prison systems from all over the world are now run by private corporations and have become business . After being sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of his commanding officer who ordered him to wipe out innocent people . Convicted soldier John Robbins is dumped on the prison island Absolom ( after he refused to execute his cell-mate and assaulted the Warden ) . On Absolom , convicts are put there to either survive or die . Robbins finds the prison island is inhabited by two camps , The Outsiders , tribes of savage prisoners led by the evil Walter Merrick and The Insiders , a community of prisoners living in a fortified village " The Compound " led by The Father . Robbins finds escape from Absolom is impossible , surveillance satellites monitor Absolom and gunships prevent all convicts from escaping from the prison island and The Warden has secretly put a spy on Absolom . Caught up in a feud between the two camps , Robbins is determined to escape from the prison island and finds it is his ultimate challenge as nobody has ever escaped and he agrees to help The Insiders defend " The Compound " from The Outsiders . i cannot believe how many times this film has been copied even though a few of them are better ( Battle Royale for instance ) , but this is still a fun movie to watch and Liotta , Wilson and Henrikson all put in good performances despite a run of the mill script and sometimes way over the top scenarios . basically an over the top violent Lord of the Flies , ' no escape ' offers nothing new , but delivers some exciting set pieces , good performances and a great villain in Merrick . the ending and most of the film are predictable , but you could do a lot worse with 110 minutes than watching this action packed guilty pleasure . .

While on patrol , the submarine is attacked and the radio systems are knocked out . An emergency message received during the battle is only partially recovered . Captain Ramsey believes it to be the order to launch on the rebels , while XO Hunter wants to wait for a confirmation message . The conflict escalates into mutiny as Ramsey and Hunter fight for control of the Alabama's nuclear missiles . for once we get a Simpson / Bruckheimer production , that isn't just about lighting and explosions and making people look good . what we get is a very tense albeit Scott stylish thriller , which grips you right from the very second act and doesn't let go from there . Washington and Hackman are excellent as adversaries , and the film really shines and grips whenever they share screen time . also , watching this film twelve years after its initial release , we also have a who's who of Hollywood . from Ryan Phillipe playing his part of staring into a fish tank , to Steve Zahn spending his time whipping someone with a towel , you may spend a lot of the time saying to yourself ' hey , isn't that ? ' . the script sparkles and you can tell where Tarantino polished up a few rusty parts . all in all a great thriller that will have you on the edge of your seat , but is predictable never the less .
538296	3717154	765429	8.0	Frank Lucas don't run away from anybody , baby . . . .	Nobody used to notice Frank Lucas , the quiet driver to one of the inner city's leading black crime bosses . But when his boss suddenly dies , Frank exploits the opening in the power structure to build his own empire and create his own version of the American Dream . Through ingenuity and a strict business ethic , he comes to rule the inner-city drug trade , flooding the streets with a purer product at a better price . Lucas outplays all of the leading crime syndicates and becomes not only one of the city's mainline corrupter's , but part of its circle of legit civic superstars . Richie Roberts is an outcast cop close enough to the streets to feel a shift of control in the drug underworld . Roberts believes someone is climbing the rungs above the known Mafia families and starts to suspect that a black power player has come from nowhere to dominate the scene . Both Lucas and Roberts share a rigorous ethical code that sets them apart from their own colleagues , making them lone figures on opposite sides of the law . The destinies of these two men will become intertwined as they approach a confrontation where only one of them can come out on topfirst of all this is a great film , the cinematography editing and direction is all flawless . Washington and Crowe are at the top of their game . but as always the media has hyped up this film so much for such a long time , that it was inevitable that i would leave the film feeling a little disappointed . reading such quotes as the best gangster film and this years departed , had me hoping for something more , and what i got was a great story about police corruption and another story about Lucas , a gangster who wouldn't think twice about shooting somebody in the head and returning to his lunch and then being the best family man a person could ever wish for . Scott overdoes it a little with the sound track , and the seventies kitsch , and under-uses Gooding Jr . and Assante in their roles . but all in all it is a great story , with some haunting scenes and some great set pieces , and the final frame of Lucas leaving Prison into a whole new era , looking very vulnerable . not as fantastic as it has been made out to be , but at least it's better than virtuosity .
538827	3717154	308055	8.0	what are you looking for ?	fictional account of the events leading up to the assassination of Robert Kennedy , we are placed in a hotel setting , focusing on the views from very different people , upper and working class , retired and the workaholics , the faithful and the infidels . seeing as this is from the star of Freejack and has his ex-wife star as his on screen wife , Estevez has made a clever , if sometimes pointless movie which observes the class system , peoples fidelity and the stress one person can cause people in different ways . with one of the best ensemble cast set to screen , Estevez has gotten good performances from everyone involve . the only problem is that the fim feels a tad too short as some of the characters could have been expanded and delved into their psyche . some of the characters are prominent and are vital to the narration , such a Hopkins , Stone and Macy . but again we have the other end of the spectrum where the characters add nothing to the film . such as Kutcher , Fishburne and ironically Estevez . but still the film is very involving at times and the second act is fantastic . a little too patriotic for me at times , this is another case of Life imitating art . Bobby will always be overshadowed by JFK

When his cattle drivers abandon him for the gold fields , rancher Wil Andersen is forced to take on a collection of young boys as his drivers in order to get his herd to market in time to avoid financial disaster . The boys learn to do a man's job under Andersen's tutelage , however , neither Andersen nor the boys know that a gang of cattle thieves is stalking them . . the film starts off in familiar Western territory , an aged Wayne with his wife on a ranch with the near impossible job of moving a herd of cows over four hundred miles does not sound like the most exhilarating film ever made . but with the addition of the titular gang , we see a different side to the character Wayne is most famous for , the grizzled Cowboy who punches first and asks questions later . they become more or less his surrogate children and despite the fact that they don't all hit it off at first , the predictable turn in the narration is soon imminent . the cast are all great as is the cinematography , especially in hi-def , but it's Wayne who makes the film such an enjoyable movie . well worth watching , and as i'd never heard of the film before , a very tear jerking movie in some ways . recommended .

Slice-of-life look at a sweet working-class couple in London , Shirley and Cyril , his mother , who's ageing quickly and becoming forgetful , mum's ghastly upper-middle-class neighbours , and Cyril's pretentious sister and philandering husband . Shirley wants a baby , but Cyril , who reads Marx and wants the world to be perfect , is reluctant . Cyril's mum locks herself out and must ask her snooty neighbours for help . Then Cyril's sister Valerie stages a surprise party for mum's 70th birthday , a disaster from start to finish . Shirley holds things together , and she and Cyril may put aside her Dutch cap after all . . . a great movie showing just how different classes live , and proving that sometimes money can't but you happiness . as always , it's the working class couple who get prevalence in the movie , Cyril and Shirley , living happily with their dead end jobs between St . Pancras and Kings Cross . it goes again to prove that they have the most love for their mother , whilst Valerie , Ctrils sister , is only interested in image and knows the cost of everything but the value of nothing . a good example is when she has the party for her mother , not thinking that she would prefer a cup of tea to a glass of champagne . then we have the snobs who live next door to Cyrils mother . these where the kind of people that other people who were trying to make an image wanted to be ' yuppies ' they were called . these people have the money and the lavish lifestyle , but unfortunately no tact , and Leigh shows them in several scenes at the beginning being very rude , but this is how they were bought up to treat people , who had ' no money ' . another look at working class life from the fantastic Leigh , sometimes depressing , always funny . well worth seeing .
538467	3717154	419946	8.0	we should have gone to the beach . . .	John Cena is called John in this film , for maybe two reasons . one , maybe he is too stupid to answer to any other name or two , maybe it's a little nod to the ' John Rambos and the John matrix's ' of our time . if this film is anything other than completely over the top , it's a learning curve for being a Marine . you can jump unbelievably high into the air and then perform a perfect dive whilst a building explodes behind you . you can survive being blasted backward several times through windows and get up and run , run , run . you can hang on the side of a truck , get hit by several buildings , get up and run , run , run . and the African-Americans in the movie have massive chips on their shoulder , exclaiming every couple of minutes ' why does it have to be the black man ? ' the story ( what there is of it ) is about a diamond heist and John being in the wrong place at the wrong time , thus , his wife is kidnapped , and he goes all , Commando in the jungle equipped with nothing but a tight t-shirt and the most exaggerated bowie knife ever ( phallic references inserted here ) . the whole thing is absolutely over the top , with a silly script , daft unbelievable set pieces with very bad acting and an extremely hammy Robert Patrick , but you cannot help but love the movie . it's short , never get's boring and is very colourful . if you are a fan of the eighties over the top action movies ( think Invasion USA , Commando , Cobra ) then this is definitely for you . plus for all Matt Damon fans , Cena looks how Damon would , if he were a lot more buff .
538453	3717154	406816	8.0	i thought you were going fishing . . . . .	an ageing USCG rescue swimmer's team is killed in a horrific rescue mission . Immediately prior to this terrible event , his wife also announced that she cannot take anymore . His first love is always the rescue mission . This leaves him an emotional wreck . His commander gives him a choice - quit or take a position as an instructor at the USCG training facility in Louisiana . Reluctantly he takes the position . Moving into the school , he immediately increases the 18 week curriculum that routinely fails half of the people that attend . Here he meets a young man with unlimited potential , but with some secret that seems to hold him back as a team player . i wasn't expecting too much from this film , as Costner isn't as high profile as he used to be , and Davis hasn't directed a good film for over 13 years . but this mix of top gun at sea an an officer and a gentleman without the shouting , is a really goo interesting drama . Costner puts in a remarkable performance as the harsh , but not too harsh ( it's Robin Hood for crying out loud ! ) senior captain , who won't any crap off of anybody , apart from Kutcher , as obviously he can see a little bit of himself twenty years ago in his personality . although the film is very predictable and ticks all of this sub-genres boxes , it is very gripping and very well made enough for you to care about the characters . no one will be surprised at the ending , but there are a few laughs along the way and the film is probably Kutchers best performance to date . a good movie .

Steven desouzas script crackles with good dialogue , and though the direction leaves a lot to be desired , this was great . everyone seems to be having a ball , and to get people such as callow , minogue , Julia and studi , it can't be all bad can it . some funny moments in the film . . . . van damme with the knife thinking that bison's army have surrendered due to him . Simon callows cameo bison's maniacal look throughout ( constipation ? ) studi as sagat ( miscast but still great ) and van damme just swaggering about knowing that he is making a truly cool movie . watch it again all you people who voted it one and enjoy the pleasure of pure popcorn entertainment .

Tobacco industry lobbyist Nick Naylor has a seemingly impossible task : promoting cigarette smoking in a time when the health hazards of the activity have become too plain to ignore . Nick , however , revels in his job , using argument and twisted logic to place , as often as not , his clients in the positions of either altruistic do-gooders or victims . Nick's son Joey needs to understand and respect his dad's philosophy , and Nick works hard to respond to that need without compromising his lack of values . When a beautiful news reporter betrays Nick's sexually-achieved trust , his world seems in danger of collapsing . But there's always one more coffin nail in Nick's pack . . . a crackling script of Mamet size genius is what makes this movie work so well , that and the lovable characters in this film . every part is played brilliantly by all involved , and Ivan Reitman must have grounded his son for making a movie that beats any of his hands down since 1984 . the situations that Naylor gets himself out of are miraculous and some of the explanations / excuses he makes are worth writing down , as they are seethingly poisonous . endlessly quotable and very topical , this is a hot potato of a movie , that doesn't preach or make any promises . it's great too that not one cigarette is smoked throughout the entire movie .

By far one of Bronsons best roles and referenced in other movies ( true romance ) . if you have never seen a Bronson film before , best to start off with this one . excellent .

The friends are going to have to escape from both the killer's clutches and annoying news reporter Gail Hailstorm if they plan on living to the sequel . . . there's not much to say really about this film , it's a funny riff on the ironic return of the slasher flick , thanks to Wes Craven , but it was released in time as the genre was getting a little stale , thanks to the repetitiveness of I Still Know , and Urban Legend . it's really close to the knuckle and very up to date , which ironically makes it look very dated now . the only thing that puts that annoys me about this movie , is that this is the only movie to blame for the slew of spoof movies that have been released since 2000 .
538116	3717154	404802	8.0	curtain down . . . . .	Harron directs this wonderful to look at biopic of the titular character , played with enthusiasm by Mol . her as Paige is played as an innocent , not knowing what she was doing at the time was classed as illegal , and her notoriety for all the wrong reasons . the film shows Paige as a god fearing woman , and we see her mention faith a few times , when asked by her drama teacher what gave her the motivation to look scared , she simply replies ' what would Jesus do if he knew about my sins ' . the use of the camera-work is good , using black and white when in New York and the old fashioned Technicolour when shooting the Miami scenes . Harron has done a great job of making the viewer see Paige from different points of view . on one hand she is childlike , not knowing the sense of danger and thinking that what ever she is doing is fun or a game . but on the other hand , if someone in todays climate acted like Paige , accepting dates from strangers or asking strangers to take them out , along with photography , the Bettie Paige of today , would be right at the other end of the spectrum . with excellent support and a great script , this is on film worth watching

After escaping from a Dungeon after being captured by the Turks during the crusades , Robin , son of Lord Locksley and a warrior , Azeem return to England only to find Robin's father has been murdered by the corrupt Sheriff of Nottingham and has taken over his Father's lands . Unable to be helped by Maid Marian , Robin vows to avenge his father and flees to the Forest of Sherwood , home to a band of outlaws who have been banished from their villages by the Sheriff of Nottingham . Combining the forces of the outlaws , Robin and his men set out on a crusade against the Sheriff of Nottingham and his henchman's bid to take over the throne of England's rightful ruler King Richard . . . . having watched both the theatrical and extended version , the extended version is longer , much longer , but there are more important plot lines in this version and the film feels a lot more satisfying and the characters ( especially Mortiana and the Sheriff ) are given much more depth . yes , it's not historically accurate and the accents leave a lot to be desired , but apart from Terminator 2 and maybe Hudson Hawk , what other film was this much fun at the movies in 1991 ? Costner does a good job as Robin and the film is different to the other numerous Robin Hood movies out there , but the film would be nothing if it wasn't for Rickman . his performance is pure pantomime and shows just how a good character actor can hold a film . would the film be as memorable if it were not for Rickman ? he has all the best lines and chews scenery whenever he is on screen , but sadly the film does feel a little redundant when he isn't on screen . but Reynolds has made a wonderful action adventure in the traditional style , full of wonderful costumes and sets and some very exciting pieces . even thought the film has aged , it is still a fun family film , that makes a lot of the recent blockbusters seem a little hollow and empty . the film was made when Costner was more or less at the top of his game , before Freeman did Shawshank , and when Rickman was known as being the best villain in the best action film ever ( in my opinion ) . plus the film has a great surprising cameo at the end , which at the time of the films release was fantastic , as it wasn't leaked because the internet wasn't around then . forget your history lessons and just enjoy a good old fashioned English adventure , albeit with American accents .

Seven years later , Laure ( now called Lily Watts ) re-surfaces as the wife of the new American ambassador to France where a certain Nicolas Barto , a Spanish photographer , takes her picture which sets the stage for a motion of events as the evil Laure resorts to low , underhanded means to protect her former identity by emotionally and financially destroying Nicolas while evading her former partners-in-crime still looking for her to reclaim the stolen diamonds . . . with this movie , after the debacle that was mission to mars and in many ways snake eyes , De Palma has made a movie that reminds you of dressed to kill and Body Double . the main thing that holds attention here is mise en scene and the stunning camera-work that Depalma was sorely lacking from his last projects . here we have all the vertigo inducing set pieces , long tracking shots , and a fantastic opening , which may have faults with the emergency lighting omission , but it's still fun . Stamos is okay in her role but is a very unlikeable character , hence the title , but this is explained in the opening credits with the movie she is watching . the film has its fair share of plot twists and red herrings , and Banderas is used to good effect in his supporting role . i am still a little undecided on the conclusion of the film , whether it is genius or way over the top , but if you like old school De Palma ala the movies i have mentioned above , this is for you .

But Yorke faces his toughest battle when his unorthodox plan to outwit the elusive Apaches leads to possible court - martial . Locked in a bloody Indian war , he must fight to redeem his honour and save the love and lives of his broken family . . . another classic film from Ford and Wayne , though why this was made because execs thought ' the quiet man ' would be a failure is beyond me . the chemistry between Wayne and O'Hara is immense , but her length in the film doesn't really garner her worthy of second top billing next to Wayne . as usual Wayne's prowess is evident on screen , and he delivers a belter of a performance , using body language as one of his main attributes to make Kirby seem like the ' ultimate soldier ' . the family background and narrative is outstanding , as are the set pieces , and it finishes in a good old fashioned way . another Ford classic , that should be seen .

Set in 1882 in the Old West territory of New Mexico , Appaloosa revolves around city marshal Virgil Cole and his deputy and partner Everett Hitch , who have made their reputation as peacekeepers in the lawless towns springing up in the untamed land . In the small mining community of Appaloosa , a ruthless , powerful rancher named Randall Bragg has allowed his band of outlaws to run roughshod over the town . After the cold-blooded murder of Appaloosa's city marshal , Cole and Hitch are hired to bring the murderer to justice . While establishing new authority with equal parts grit and guns , Cole and Hitch meet provocative newcomer Allison French , whose unconventional ways threaten to undermine their progress and to destroy the two lawmen's decade-old partnership . . . even though it's a western , this is a very modern movie with some great cinematography and great performances from the two leads . for once Irons Doesn't ham it up as the villain and compliments the move very well . the weak part is Zellwegger , who just doesn't seem to fit in the film at all . having never read the source material that this is based on , i cannot comment on how faithful the adaptation is , but i've read that it pretty much is . it's funny in places , especially when people mispronounce words , and it's a highly overlooked movie , which deserves to be seen . it's not going to revive the western , but it's a good movie nevertheless .

Another Summer , another Will Smith Event Movie . but unlike any other summer release this year , this film make syou actually dislike the titular character for the majority of the movie . it's very refreshing to see Smith in a role what we wouldn't normally associate with the man . he usually plays clean cut , heroic , all American guys who are living the dream . in this he's a lowlife , with a dirty mouth , twenty years ago , Eddie Murphy would have been perfect , but Smith makes the film thanks to his performance . story-wise , it isn't much , it's simple and Berg keeps the thin plot going , with some good set pieces and impressive effects . it works well until the last 15 minutes when get the obligatory sweet ending , and the ' Empire Strikes Back ' twist . it is laugh out loud in places and it is a highly original summer movie , well worth seeing

Beginning with Emma's marriage , Aurora shows how difficult and loving she can be . The movie covers several years of their lives as each finds different reasons to go on living and find joy . Aurora's interludes with Garrett Breedlove , retired astronaut and next door neighbour are quite striking . In the end , different people show their love in very different ways . i wish i wasn't so curious and demanded a friend of mine to tell me the ending , because while watching and really enjoying the performances and struggles of all the characters involved , i couldn't help but having the inevitable ending in the back of my head throughout the duration . but the film is near flawless and the performances from all the main cast are fantastic , especially Maclaine and Nicholson , as the bickering neighbours . it wears it's heart on it's sleeve and Brooks proves that he is a good story maker and can make a great film . such a film to watch in whatever mood your in , it will bring a smile and tears to you throughout .
538673	3717154	1013753	8.0	without hope , life is not worth living . . .	Using flashbacks from a statement recorded late in life and archival footage for atmosphere , this film traces Harvey Milk's career from his 40th birthday to his death . He leaves the closet and New York , opens a camera shop that becomes the salon for San Francisco's growing gay community , and organises gays ' purchasing power to build political alliances . He runs for office with lover Scott Smith as his campaign manager . Victory finally comes on the same day Dan White wins in the city's conservative district . The rest of the film sketches Milk's relationship with White and the 1978 fight against a statewide initiative to bar gays and their supporters from public school jobs . . . This is Penns film all the way . his portrayal of Milk is astounding and he excels himself in every way possible as an actor . Van Sant has set the mood right for the the era and has himself an excellent cast , all the performances here are flawless and bring a little more to the film . it's a very heavily political movie , and it does show the struggles that Milks career had on his friends and loved ones , but somehow he always rose above all of the struggles and kept coming back for more , never backing down . Brolin gain shows he has breathed a second life into his acting career and is terrifying as Dan White , and he steals the final ten minutes of the film from Penn , with his facial gestures , calm and collective all the way throughout . editing is great as is the score by Elfman , which gives the film a more dramatic edge . if like myself you had never heard of Harvey Milk , i urge you to see this , because this is a story about a man who had something actually important to say , and spoke for a lot of people who were too afraid too . remarkable .

His cell-mate John Smith that was sentenced to life revenging the death of his family befriends Wade and gives helpful advices and hope to Wade to return to his family . . what a really good movie this is ! i honestly was not expecting much while reading the credits ' And Val Kilmer ' it doesn't really get your pulse pumping ( no offence Val ) but i was surprised at the excellent writing , performances from Kilmer , Dorff and Perrin . . . that bloke from Matrix reloaded , and the taut running time , that made this film gripping and exciting , until the very end . it never gets boring and there are some great lines of dialogue spoken by Kilmer , who is the baddest of the bad , because he wears glasses , has a beard , and gets visited by Sam Shepard a lot . the ending is a little predictable but the best performance comes from perrinaeu ( really don't know how to spell his name ) who is sadistic , and genuinely nasty throughout , watching the prisoners in glee as they beat the crap out of each other , and then being nice as pie to his colleagues out of work . all in all if you see this in the rental store and are in two minds , trust me , it's worth the risk .

The only hope is the cousin of one of his drinking partners , can she pull him through it ? after his family outings of teen wolf , back to the future and the secret of my success , it was time for Fox to take his turn at the adult audience . basically this film is a downspiral journey for the users of cocaine in the excessive eighties . all is present here . shoulder pads , checkbizarre suits , checkgreat music , checkthe plot is very hard to follow , with sub-plots involving a comatose baby , mothers dying and a failed marriage . but this film has a passage of rites , do not take cocaine as it will make you paranoid ! ! ! Fox is great as Jamie , putting in an effortless performance as a man whose life is going from bad to worse . it's a shame though that Sutherland and Cates are limited to minor roles as they are very good with the material that they are given . the New York photography is marvellous and makes the city look very melancholy in some scenes . but there are some unintentional laugh out loud moments and some very bizarre situations . was there really any need for Jamie to run away from his brother ? the catwalk piece is very cringworthy , but for a drama , it scores very high , and can be very depressing in some areas of the movie . but the soundtrack and cinematography is a marvel and is worth seeing .

Upon arrival , he quickly discovers that his presence is quite nonessential , and is considered insignificant to the other soldiers , as he has not fought for as long as the rest of them and felt the effects of combat . Chris has two commanding officers , the ill-tempered and indestructible Staff Sergeant Robert Barnes and the more pleasant and cooperative Sergeant Elias Grodin . A line is drawn between the two officers and a number of men in the platoon when an illegal killing occurs during a village raid . As the war continues , Chris himself draws towards psychological meltdown . And as he struggles for survival , he soon realises he is fighting two battles , the conflict with the enemy and the conflict between the men within his platoon . . . . . . knowing that this is based on Stones time in Vietnam adds to the harsh reality that the film is already delivering throughout . the film is very layered , and has several meanings after multiple viewings . on one account , this is an angry outcry of a pointless war , where many a man lost his life due to politics and / or discrimination , institutionalised murder , if you will . on another level , the film depicts the American troops as the enemy , as the invader , especially during the village raid scenes . some people may deny this , some patriots may scoff , but everybody can be pushed too far . and finally as Sheens narration explains at the end of the movie , the VC were not the enemy , the enemy were within themselves , with Barnes and Elias at constant loggerheads during the movie , the good and evil of America , the devil and god fighting in purgatory . the performances are incredible from all involved and Stone has made a masterpiece , probably his finest film to date . it's a labour of ? love for him , as he clearly wants to send a message out with this film . sometimes difficult to watch , but a must see .

As Gino is hunting Madano down , Gino discovers the motive behind Bobby's murder . This is when Gino's hunt for Madano leads to the showdown of a lifetime . . . . after three great films , Seagal came and added a fourth to his impressive resume ' . as Felino , Seagal shows off his mighty fighting skills coming up against his most psychotic screen adversary ( a great William Forsythe ) . the story is a little lame though ( his partner slept with Richie's girlfriend and this is why bobby was killed ) , but if you read between the lines , this is a film about honour and respect people deserve . we see Gino mixing with the mob , and reminiscing in several scenes about his childhood ( which shows Gino could have chosen the wrong path to go down very easily ) . the set pieces are terrific , especially the bar fight and the butcher shop fight . my only gripe is that some of the editing is very random , and makes the film look like it's turned into a different genre . but still , this is one of seagals best , and a million miles away from some of his direct to DVD stuff he does now . if you are one of the people who wonder why people love seagal , even though he makes pap now , then check this out . you will realise he was one of the best action stars of the late eighties / early nineties .
538949	3717154	465602	9.0	talk about shooting your load . . . .	this movie is basically a video game on screen . it's frenetic , fast paced and non-stop until the final credits roll . why was this movie made ? heavens knows why , but if you like films like face / off or anything John Woo has done or ever will doe , you will probably love this as much as i did . the story is your basic silly one , a lone man named Smith helps a pregnant lady deliver her baby under gunfire , he takes care of the baby all the while being chased by Paul Giammati and his endless supply of disposable bad guys . on the way he teams up with Monica Belluci and then he figures out why they are so desperate for the baby , it's carrying the bone marrow that will save someone important . for eighty odd minutes we are treated to non stop action , inventive set pieces , gunfights while delivering a baby , gunfights during sexual intercourse , gunfights while sky diving . this is Owen's shout out to Broccoli , his Bond , and to be fair he does a pretty good job of playing the mysterious good guy , while not all the while good , his best interest is the baby , but he does carry a massive chip on his shoulder , thinking the world owes him something . Giamatti too is wonderful in his role , almost usurping Rickman in Robin Hood as the most pantomime villain ever seen on screen . not for all tastes , this is for action junkies only , and a wild ride too

However , an unfortunate accident keeps Terry from the reunion , and Nicky fears that she has married or does not love him anymore . Will he discover the truth behind her absence and reunite with his one true love , or has fate and destiny passed them by ? . . . this film works because of the great chemistry between Grant and Kerr . they look like the couple in love from the very beginning of the movie . the scenes on the cruise are a joy to watch , and at times , some scenes are laugh out loud hilarious . knowing that a lot of the dialogue was improvised by the two leads just adds to the enjoyment of the picture . knowing that the two have partners when they meet , makes the viewer feel somewhat guilty in hoping that thay do keep to their promise , but oddly enough , both partners are very supportive . the cinematography and editing are both wonderful , as is the story , but Grant and Kerr make the film into the classic that it is today . with one of the most happiest endings ever committed to screen , this is a true love story for romantics everywhere . well worth seeing .

Jon Finch plays your typical uptight Brit , a man who is down on his luck , he's just been fired by Bernard Cribbens for having a sly brandy at the pub he works , and is down to his last few pounds . the only real friends it appears at the moment is Bob , a jack the lad stereotypical English wide boy , who always keeps a big wad of cash in his pocket . Hitchcock treats us to a great story , a not very likable lead character , and the revelation of the murderer very early on into the film , and also , Hitchcock delves deep into sexual frustration and how it affects some people . there is much humour to the film also , especially the scenes where the meals take place and the police commissioner cannot stand his wife's food . the trademark mark Hitchcock Cameo is here ( he's the one who doesn't applaud at the beginning ) and there is one truly genius use of camera-work where the murderer is standing between two paintings of females , denoting that he has killed two women . but the London setting has aged very badly and some of the typecast English people are laugh out loud ( all ' what , what ' and ' alright guv'nor ? ' ) , and there is really no need for the face that one of the victims pulls as it does make you chuckle , but the film is tense and there are some wonderful set pieces . after 40 years in the game , Hitchcock still shows he is the master of suspense

Jim is devastated and discovers that his parents are both dead . when Mark is killed by Selena ( because he has become infected ) they venture around and fin find a father and daughter who have been staying in their flat to protect them from the infected . they learn that ' salvation ' is in Manchester and meet up with some soldiers , but who are the real monsters ? ? from the Stark opening imagery of a bare London , this film is unsettling as it is entertaining . it's a simple story , but done with so much passion and hard work that it's impossible not to enjoy . there are some jaw-dropping moments , not only the desolate London , but when Selena kills Mark and gives no second thought to the act . these peole are the minority now as the infected dominate the demography . the film changes it's pace in the second act when they reach Manchester and we forget about the infected for a while , due to the savagery of the soldiers . heartbreaking in places , funny in others , but never taking that sense of dread from your mind as you learn that nowhere is safe . the only let down is the ending . had they kept it downbeat as originally planned , this would have been a masterpiece , but t is slightly marred by the ending . still a great British movie though , and the cast are fantastic and also the camera-work demands praise , for showing a ' no frills ' attitude toward the film .

After spending the cold day on the beach , he meets Clementine Kruczynski on the train station and they have a crush on each other . Joel and Clementine do not know that they were mates in the past . Joel has just erased Clementine from his memories when he found that Clementine did exactly the same , when their relationship ended . However , along his erasing process , Joel becomes astonished when he finds that he still loves Clementine and he does not want to lose her , fighting for keeping the memories of their moments together instead . . . This movie gives a new meaning to " You never know what you've got until it's gone . " , as we see Barish fighting along the waves of layered stories , stark effects , ans subliminal images to try and save his relationship with Clementine . the film delivers the feeling that we have dropped into someones sub-conscious as we remember their best dreams and nightscapes . surprisingly , the film is really easy to understand , but very difficult to explain . Carrey is perfect as Barish and Winslet fantastic as Clementine , they have great chemistry together and along with the story , really hold the film above others that have been released so far this century . the film reminds me of waking up from an amazing dream , and a couple of seconds later realising that your back to reality . this movie is the couple of seconds between dreamworld and reality . It'll make you realise that at the end of the day , our memories are all we really have , and when they're gone , we're gone , so why waste time contemplating on the cringe worthy memories that happen to everybody ( things you have said , or done ) and concentrate on the things that have made you feel great . this film has to be seen more than once to appreciate it's rich narrative , hidden meanings and mise ' en scene . one of the best films to be released so far this century . amazing .
539130	3717154	93409	10.0	let's get the flock outta here . . . . .	my dad introduced me to this film in 1988 when i was eleven years old . i remember being absolutely blown away by this movie , which is one of the two best action films of the late eighties ( the other being die hard , and Predator is a sci-fi , so it doesn't count ) . Gibson plays Riggs , a man who has lost his wife and has nothing to live for . ha is assigned to work with Murtaugh , a man at the other end of the spectrum , has a loving family , and is well respected as a police officer . usually i would stae that this has all the cliché's of the ' buddy cop ' movies , but this is the one that defined that particular sub genre , and watching it 19 years after the first viewing , it still feels as fresh and as vibrant as it did back then . the film does have minor flaws when viewed , but this just adds to the charm of the picture . the chemistry between Gibson and Glover is electrifying , and the script , by Black , is one of the best he has ever written , and is still endlessly quotable to this day . all the boxes have been ticked for this kind of picture . over the top set pieces ? you've got it , from the very tense desert showdown , to the Torture sequence , all the way to the fantastically over the top fight at the end . plot wise , the story is good , if unoriginal , but the story goes second place to the character arcs the two leads have . seeing the directors cut shows just how lonely and desperate Riggs is , from paying a women to watch TV , to the obvious suicide references from the cinematic release . Riggs is the heart and soul of the film , and you really do care about him come the end of the movie . hilarious , action packed , dramatic and exciting all at the same time , the film doesn't let you breathe for it's duration , and they certainly do not make them like this anymore . the best in the series , this is a raw action movie , and sadly , Riggs became softer and softer as the sequels progressed . if you yearn for the good old days where the action star was very un-pc and wasn't a perma tanned wooden actor , this and die hard will give you the nostalgia you need . no one is too old for this sht

Mods , New Romantics , and Skinheads are the major youth sub-cultures of this very English summer of 1983 and young 12-year-old Shaun is left wandering aimlessly alone and lost during the start of his school holidays , until his chance meeting with Woody and his fun and friendly Skinhead pack . Finding a new lease of life ; girls , parties , Ben Sherman shirts , Doc Martin boots and shaven hairstyles young Shaun is welcomed , life during this summer holiday has got a whole lot better . That is until Combo arrives on the scene , a bitter , dangerous , racist , militant and psychotic life for young Shaun has just approached his first major crossroads . This is England is a look back at the early eighties of British working-class life through the eyes of young Shaun and his new gang , and dealing with the bitterness of outside influences such as racism and xenophobia , of mass unemployment and the fall out of the Falkland's War ; Thatcher's Britain : Did we ever have it so good ? Sahne Meadows has made his most important and most grown up piece of work with this movie which is very hard to watch , but never the less very entertaining . a friend of mine said ' they wouldn't be able to make films like this now ' not knowing that the film is relatively new . this is the attention to detail that Meadows has done for this film . all the exterior sets and design are straight from the eighties , and he has hit the nail right on the head with clothes , music , and basically the attitude that certain people had with the era and ' Thatchers Britain ' . the film is very funny to begin with and the performance from Turgoose is amazing . his transformation from bereaved loner , to skinhead is scary yet somehow elating to watch , as he has finally found some friends who listen . but the film belongs to Graham as Comboe , probably the most frightening and real character seen in British cinema . his monologues hit home hard , and as the characters say on numerous occasions , there is an atmosphere whenever he is around . his character is so unpredictable and unstable , but yet he sometimes appears to be the most mature person in the film , a very bad father figure for Shaun . an amazing experience , both visceral and nostalgic ( in the first act at least ) for those growing up in the eighties .

Meanwhile , Enid and Rebecca play a prank on Seymour ( Steve Buscemi ) , a middle-aged collector of vinyl records that also has difficulties with relationships . Seymour and Enid eventually become friends . As time goes by , Enid reaches maturity and develops a different view of life . an excellent adaptation of the titular comic book , Ghost World is just that , a town that appears to be like something straight from twin peaks , and every character that utters a line has something kooky or kitsch about them . maybe this is Zwigoffs intentions with the film , but after the second act you become to realise that Enid and Seymour are the most normal people you could ever meet , but if you were to pass them on the street , you would have to stare at them . the film is hilarious in parts and heartbreaking in others ( i felt guilty along with Enid after playing the prank on Seymour ) and this is because the characters are so interesting and have had great thought to them . Buscemi steals the film though , and this could be one of his best performances to date . it's got cult classic written all over it , and if you happen to come across this gem , rent or buy it , you will surprised how much you relate to the move . amazing

It becomes an agenda to Batman to stop the mysterious Joker at all costs , knowing that both of them are in an opposite line . One has no method at all and seeks to see the world plunge into the fire he has yet to light . One represents the symbol of hope and uses his own shadow to bring the peace and order he has yet to accomplish doing . . . what is there to say about this movie that hasn't already been said ? the best movie of last year is also the best Comic Book movie ever , and has some of the most character development ever seen in a movie . going down the predictable , path , Ledger absolutely owns this movie , his Joker is the most psychotic , mysterious , and downright scary movie villain incarnation ever to hit the screen . why ? because you never find out how he got ' those ' scars , telling people different stories about them . his agenda . he has none , except anarchy . this is a man with nothing to lose and has no reason for doing what he does , apart from one thing , enjoyment . this is what makes him a truly monumental adversary . the cinematography is amazing , especially the parts filmed especially for IMAX , and adds a whole new depth to Gotham and the film . the supporting cast are amazing and Eckhart as Dent , brings emotion and depth into a love triangle . Bale is as good as always , and Caine provides the much needed balance of humour and empathy to Wayne's world as he goes through his most difficult time . heavily influenced by Heat , The Dark Knight is worth watching again and again , it has amazing production values , good narrative structure and some of the best editing and sound i have ever heard . a film that really does live up to the hype . .
538823	3717154	64541	10.0	bloody hell fire . . . . . .	really taking the sixties working class regime and immortalising it on screen , Loach has made one of the best dramas about working class folk that there is . Casper is a bit of a loner as the hero of the picture , and makes a bond with the titular bird , and in turns a corner for him in his stage of life . if it wasn't for the Kestrel , then Billy may have not distanced himself from his former friends and may have rebelled against his mother and followed his brothers footsteps later on in his life . instead with Kes , he is able to block out what is the reality of his life and situation , and go away into a fantasy worlds when he is with his Kestrel . the cinematography here is outstanding , and shows England for what it was for the working class family back then , hard to swallow , with just a few laughs throughout . the film is extremely funny in places , for instance , Glovers PE teacher and his football match is hilarious to watch . also the film is tragic as the ending of the film shows us that Casper has gone back to his reality , knowing that he faces a downward spiral that will lead to just another wasted youth . his Kestrel is a form of communication at times , he is able to reach out to people with Kes , people who wouldn't really bother with him otherwise , knowing that Casper has other interests makes other friends and his Brother Jealous , knowing that Billy can find something different to them in this life . faithfully restoring the book , Loach has made a fantastic , if dingy looking drama with great performances from all those involved .
538343	3717154	109506	10.0	Victims , aren't we all ? . . . .	Shelly and Eric were very much in love . But no one gets married on Halloween , not in Detroit . Shelly is raped and beaten by city boss Top Dollar's thugs , only to die 30 hours later in a hospital . Eric is shot and pushed out a window . A year later death is no longer what it was as Eric Draven , accompanied by a Crow and gifted with new powers and a world of grief and pain , is brought back to life to avenge his love's death . After all , love is forever . And some of us Believe in Angels . . . what could have been just another average comic book action movie , turns out to be a really dramatic and romantic love story , with a hint of vengeance . this is partly thanks to Proyas , who has made a very impressive set and layout , and the source material from O'Barr , which is very tragic to say the least . you cannot but be biast about Lee though , because even though he was tragically killed on set , it's very difficult to tell his stand in from the real thing . Lee puts in such a tragic and sympathetic performance , that whenever he is off screen , the film drops a little . Wincott puts in another gravelly performance as ' top dollar ' the boss who had the couple killed that tragic night . the film is great to watch , and the connotations are rife on screen , as when the crow becomes weaker , Dravens make up becomes more fainter . the set pieces are wonderful , as is the soundtrack , if you want a proper tragic ' superhero ' movie , you could do a lot worse . but also read the graphic novel too , it will make the movie more prolific .

As workers are turned against each other , Terry Malloy inadvertently participates in the murder of fellow longshoreman Joey Doyle . Union boss Johnny Friendly orchestrates the murder along with other illegal dockside activities , aided by Terry's brother Charley . Terry begins to feel pangs of conscience . When Joey's sister Edie sees more in Terry than he sees in himself and Father Barry urges him on , Terry reassesses his past and begins to regain responsibility for his actions . . . . throughout the film we see a lot of symbolism . two of the main symbols we see are prominent throughout the movie . the first one is Terry's jacket . when the movie begins , we see him in a checkered jacket , indicating that he doesn't know what side he is on . the second instance with the jacket is when we see Terry in his suit jacket . when he is being escorted to his apartment by the police , we see a little tear under the left shoulder , indicating that maybe he has ruined his life in doing what he had just done . the symbol with the jacket is in the final scene , this time wearing a full block coloured jacket , indicating he knows what side he is one . the second symbol is to do with the pigeons . the pigeons are represented as the dockworkers , scared of the hawks ( Friendly and company ) and holed up in a cage ad they have no where else to go and no one else to turn to . when terry finds the pigeons dead , this could indicate that his fellow work mates have turned their back on him for doing the right thing . the beginning of the film includes a situation with a pigeon . the performances are fantastic for this production and Brando deserves all the acclaim he received for this performance , and he never bettered himself . during the ' i coulda been a contender ' speech , it brings a tear to the eye because his role is so convincing , you can feel Terrys pain when the self realisation of knowing he has ruined his life sets in . the final dock scene is one of the most satisfying scenes ever committed to celluloid , showing that Terry has won the war , this is shown on screen by the shutters closing down to Friendly when he is alone and at his lowest ebb . with fantastic cinematography and narration , the film is very downbeat and dark , it could almost be considered to be film noir . a classic in every sense .
538165	3717154	70034	10.0	boards don't hit back . . . .	Lee , a member of a Shaolin Temple , is a master of the physical and spiritual disciplines of the martial arts , and is being visited by Braithwaite , a British law officer . Lee has been invited to a tri-annual martial arts tournament held on an island owned by Han , a reclusive billionaire who was once a member of the Temple but has now become a renegade . Braithwaite believes Han uses his tournaments as cover for narcotic and prostitution activities . Lee reluctantly agrees to enter the tournament , but his reluctance to confront Han disappears when a Shaolin monk reveals that during the previous staging of this tournament , he and Lee's sister were accosted by several toughs led by Han's personal bodyguard , an American named O'Hara . In the ensuing confrontation the monk cut a deep scar on O'Hara's face but Lee's sister ultimately perished , and at her graveside Lee vows revenge for her death . Also attending the tournament are two American martial arts experts , John Roper and Kelly Williams , who served together in Vietnam and took differing paths toward martial arts upon their discharge - Roper is on the run from Mafia gambling debt collectors , while Williams was accosted by two racist cops whom he'd dispatched before stealing their car to escape . All three will soon find themselves at the mercy of Han and his army of martial arts fighters as he protects his underground factory of narcotics and prostitution . what can said about this film that hasn't been said before ? yes Sammo Hung gets his butt kicked by Lee , yes Jackie Chan sports a moustache and gets killed by Lee , but in my opinion this has to be the best martial arts movie that has ever been made , and in over thirty years , thats one big achievement . Lee emulates the screen whenever he is present , whether this has to do with the fact that he sadly passed on before the films release is that of discussion , but no one can deny the affect of the set pieces . the final 30 minutes just go so quick that it has to be seen to be believed . yes there are continuity problems with the big brawl at the end with shots being used again and again , but thanks to Schafrins timeless soundtrack , it never gets boring . the plot comes straight from a Bond vehicle , very easy to follow and very predictable , but it's the style the way the movie is filmed that makes it legendary . the hall of mirrors sequence is so intricately filmed with so much detail , that one cannot help but look for cameras in the reflections , and not one can be seen . after more than thirty years , the film still feels as vibrant and exciting as the first time i've ever seen it ( 1984 ) and now the most completest version is available to buy on blu-ray , it's time to get out your hard earned , and celebrate the best martial arts movie again and again . indispensable .

Theo becomes an unlikely champion of earths survival as he knows people in high places and can help the young girl . the young girl is the planets last remaining hope , the first pregnant woman in over eighteen years . when she is threatened , Theo is forced to face his own demons and protect her and the unborn child from certain peril . now that the summer has officially ended , we come to the part of the year when we start to get more serious pictures that can be deemed as Oscar worthy . and if one film deserves to win for best cinematography , then this is the movie . not since ' saving private Ryan ' has someone made a war torn area seem so real and so near , yet still make the scene edge of the seat stuff . having not read the original source material , i had no idea what was in store . but the movie is a fusion of films such as 1984 , 28 days later ( in the dystopian London , nothing to do with plot ) , and several other post apocalyptic movies . but unlike movies like ' bladerunner ' the future only has subtle changes that are really ' blink and you miss them ' category changes . yes the London in this film is full of segregation and discrimination , but the buses have moving advertisements on them , and even the Tate Modern is now someones living quarters . the story though is very topical . what if this really happens ? what if all the damage that we are doing to the earth , causes problems with our genetic pattern ? and we are no longer able to bear children . this would make our existence pointless , and the violence seen in this movie could happen . the film is science-fiction , but the story is very plausible . Owen really shines in this movie , and this could be the movie that will put him up there with the cream of British talent , it also means that he has scored a hat-trick this year with three very good rolessupport is fantastic in the form of Caine , Moore , Ferris and Ejiofor and they bring am edge to the film in their very different roles . the editing is fantastic and the camera work is to die for , with some mind-blowing steady cam shots . one that springs to mind is in the final act where Theo is trying to rescue the baby . the camera never really leaves Theos ' side and we can feel every bullet and explosion with him . an amazing film that has a very touchy sub-plot ( refugees ) and will stick with the viewer long after , and maybe even change the way they take the human life for granted . maybe .
538441	3717154	85474	10.0	a work of comedy genius	Over 20 years after this was first released , this is still absolutely hilarious stuff from start to finish , no matter how many times you watch it . Finally released on DVD in Britain , the jokes never fail to raise a smile , from the cookout story , to Uncle Gus , and his drunk father talking about his house , it's still funny . but also it's one of the most politically incorrect shows i've ever seen , and the opening of Eddies performance and him talking about ' faggots ' may raise a few gasps or tuts now . but because it's wrong to laugh at this sort of stuff now , because you'd end up in court , makes it even more funnier now , than it was . much better than ' Raw ' this is Murphy at his prime , and after Beverly Hills Cop , his career peaked and it was all downhill from there . stop making kiddie friendly films Eddie , we love you saying FK ! ! ! !

On the warmest day of the year , the country estate takes on an unsettling hothouse atmosphere , stoking Briony's vivid imagination . Robbie Turner , the educated son of the family's housekeeper , carries a torch for Briony's headstrong older sister Cecilia . Cecilia , he hopes , has comparable feelings ; all it will take is one spark for this relationship to combust . When it does , Briony - - who has a crush on Robbie - - is compelled to interfere , going so far as accusing Robbie of a crime he did not commit . Cecilia and Robbie declare their love for each other , but he is arrested - - and with Briony bearing false witness , the course of three lives is changed forever . Briony continues to seek forgiveness for her childhood misdeed . Through a terrible and courageous act of imagination , she finds the path to her uncertain atonement , and to an understanding of the power of enduring love . an absolutely amazing adaptation of the novel ' Atonement ' really captures the essence of the thirties and the cinematography and narration are some of the best i have seen this year . the film explains the way we perceive things when we don't know the full story , like when you walk in on a conversation , some people get the wrong idea of the conversation , but this story makes this harrowing and unimaginable . the long shot featuring the killing of the horses and the ferris wheel whilst the soldiers walk to the bar , is every bit as amazing as the long shot seen in last years ' children of men ' . but it's the final act that is truly heartbreaking , and for people who have not read the source material , will stick with you a long time after the film has finished . a beautiful piece of work , probably one of the most lavish films of the year , it really has to be seen anyone who is love . .

James Bond , armed with his specially equipped Aston Martin , must stop the plan by overcoming several adversaries . First there's Oddjob , the mute servant who kills at the toss of a lethal hat , sexy pilot Pussy Galore , whose romantic feelings for Bond complicate her involvement in Goldfinger's high - flying scheme . . . . . the bond film that is the most loved and most respected by audiences and critics alike . this introduces a wind of change in the bond series , after the dark tones of ' dr . no ' and ' from Russia with love ' this has a more brighter setting and more life than the other two . the film is very simple and the story is very straight forward and easy to follow . Goldfinger plans to turn all American gold radioactive , so his gold will become more expensive for the next 58 years . as diabolical plots go , this is very fiendish , but there is always bond to save the day . by now Connery must have known that Bond was a national institution , and you can see a little more of a swagger and a little more cocky in his ways , but this is why Connery is the best remembered Bond , he had no-one to follow and so had no actor to live up to . the film has aged badly in some scenes , the treatment of the female in a derogatory way and the laser beams and special effects . but this is the sixties , so it can be forgiven . the supporting cast are great especially Blackman as Pussy Galore and Sakata as Oddjob , who oozes menace and fear whenever he graces the screen . Jaws is definitely an inspiration to this character and probably would not have been created was it not for Oddjob . all in all a fantastic movie in itself and one of the three best bond movies ever . if you have never seen a Bond movie , this would be the ideal place to start .

After hard years in exile for a crime he didn't commit , Benjamin Barker now Sweeney Todd , returns to London to find his wife dead and his daughter in the hands of the evil Judge Turpin . In his anger , Sweeney goes on a murderous rampage on all London , with the help of Mrs . Lovett , he opens a barber shop in which he lures his victims in with a charming smile before casually ending their life with a flick of his razor across their neck . But not one man killed , nor ten thousands men can satisfy Sweeney's lust for revenge on those who've caused his years of pain . a massive gamble has paid off , in this eccentric monotone nightmare of a movie , where for some reason the songs feel almost childlike as Todd does throughout the movie . Burton and Depp are on top form , and it goes to show that they can stand proudly next to De niro / Scorcese as the cream of the actor / Director collaborators . the film is very eerie throughout and the monotone colours of old London make the killings even more visceral than they are . Depp has a wonderful singing voice , not too dissimilar to David Bowie , and he is supported greatly by Rickman , Carter , Spall , and Cohen . sometimes the film is laugh out loud funny , sometimes it is a sobering and frightening experience , but it's never dull , always entertaining , and i don't think i've ever seen anything quite like it before . absolutely destined for cult status , this is one of Depps best performances and one of Burtons most ambitious projects . a must see .

Unsatisfied with Bill's justice , the prostitutes put a bounty on the cowboys . The bounty attracts a young gun billing himself as ' The Schofield Kid ' , and ageing killer William Munny . Munny reformed for his young wife , and has been raising crops and two children in peace . But his wife is gone . Farm life is hard . And Munny is no good at it . So he calls his old partner Ned , saddles his ornery nag , and rides off to kill one more time , blurring the lines between heroism and villainy , man and mythone of Eastwoods finest acting and directing collaborations to date , ' Unforgiven ' is a movie about the dark side of a reformed character and how they can turn in the blink of an eye ( as referenced in the schofield kids short sightedness ) . from the beginning , Munny just seems like a normal person who just wants to get on with his life and try to make an earnest living , believing that Karma took his wife away ( not on screen just my opinion as perceived by the narrative ) , he decides to partake in the execution of the offenders . all of the main characters have big opportunities to expand their story on screen , and the three veteran leads are astounding on screen , and have wonderful dialogue . lighting is a main part of this film , especially in the final third , when Eastwood films his mini version of ' high plains drifter ' , where Munny becomes the devil and wreaks havoc on the town . even though some of the dialogue in this sequence is funny , it's one of the most tense sequences ever committed to a western . Eastwood has made what some can argue as the last great western , but it's a great story , with a great script , and a fantastic director at the helm . a must see .
538293	3717154	386032	10.0	we swim together , we sink together . . .	Michael Moore interviews Americans who have been denied treatment by our health care insurance companies - - companies who sacrifice essential health services in order to maximise profits . The consequences for the individual subscribers range from bankruptcy to the unnecessary deaths of loved ones . A group of Americans who became ill from volunteering at Ground Zero , but were refused health coverage for their illnesses , are ferried by Moore to Cuba , where they receive the top-rate , free care one would hope they'd get here at home . In his interviews , historical reportage , and typical sarcastic wit , Moore soundly condemns American health insurance companies and pharmaceutical companies , as well as the politicians who have been paid millions to do their bidding . He makes the case that there is something wrong with Americans that we cannot learn from the successes of other countries in providing better quality-of-health than they enjoy in the USA . as a nurse in the UK , it makes me glad that we have such a good health service , despite it's flaws . compared to the USA . our patients are treated like royalty , not left to die or wander the streets as Moore observes here on several occasions . but the film is very sad and sometimes very hard to watch , and if i were American , i'd feel that Moore was rubbing my nose about health across the world a little . probably his most accessible film outside the USA , i suggest that everyone who moans about the NHS watch this film , and then eat a little bit of humble pie . a true revelation .
538193	3717154	407887	10.0	i'm the guy doing his job . you must be the other guy . . . .	the film starts ' a few years ago ' when we are introduced to Frank Costello , one of the most notorious crimelords in Boston . he meets a young Colin , who Frank moulds him to be an informant for him by joining the police service , and reporting back to him their every move . during Colins training , we are introduced to Billy Costigan , a streetwise ' southie ' who graduates around the same time as Colin , and is sent ( very ) deep into undercover , to work for Costello . what happens now is a hectic race to uncover the rat on both sides , and the most crucial part is who is uncovered first , as it will spell certain death for them . . . from the opening prologue , with Nicholsons narration and his figure doused in shadow , you know that Scorcese is back in ' Goodfellas ' territory , with its fabulous opening introducing the characters and all its flashy editing and profound use of expletives . the thing that amazed me most about this film was how long the pre-title sequence was . it is almost twenty-five minutes before the title appears on the screen , and when it appears , i was genuinely speechless as i totally forgot that the titles had not been introduced . what Scorcese does with the cast is phenomenal . not Even Nicholson can pull the rug from anybody . Dicaprio , Damon , Baldwin , Sheen , Winstone and even Whalberg put in career best performances in this movie . one of the messages in this movie is about identity ( in my opinion ) . there is one scene that particularly gave this message . when Damon is enjoying dinner with Madolyn , it keeps cutting back to Costigan , looking claustrophobic and tense , indicating that sometimes the villains do get all the perks , whilst the honest people get zip . their are a few very minor flaws to this film though . 1 . overuse of mobile phones . could this film have been made sixteen years ago ? don't think so . i know the cellular phone is crucial to the plot , but having phones wired when someone close could be found out has been done before ( out of time ) . 2 . it sags ever so slightly for about twenty minutes , when Madolyn moves in with Sullivan . that's it really . the final third is Scorcese at his finest , and i do not think you will see anything as taut , tense and gripping on screen for a good while . the set pieces are terrific and given a lot of thought into their set ups and the editing is seamless . the narrative can be at times somewhat confusing , with flashbacks and flash - forwards becoming all but too comfortable in the film . the soundtrack is very subtle and not as loud as other films would have their songs played . which excels the film . as a remake of ' Infernal Affairs ' it exceeds the original by filling out the characters so the viewer can show empathy toward them . but if you have not seen the original , please try to see this first , as it will be a total different viewing experience . as for me and others who have seen the original , some of the important plot points and ' shocks ' were not new , so it kind of spoilt the whole viewing experience . ( to people who have seen the original , imagine seeing this film before the original and think about the lift sequence toward the end . . . . . . i know ) but still , this is one of the best , if not THE best of the year , and should hopefully score well with the academy . don't think Scorcese will be nominated though . but from seeing this , i don't think he really cares , he's clearly having a ball , as you will too . classic cinema .
538607	3717154	95016	10.0	happy trails	in 1988 Joel silver was unbeatable in the action genre . with this and lethal weapon he had the majority of the market . now look at him . useless . but Bruce Willis made this film his own . the first real action star who seemed vulnerable and who did genuinely get hurt . thats what makes this film one of the best of the genre . all the support are fantastic too . with praise going to Reggie veljohnson the buddy who mclane never meets until the end but gives him a knowing look , William atherton who shows that his character Walter peck in ghost busters can be expanded to good measure . but above all else the real star of the show is Alan rickman the uber villain . no one can do evil now like rickman and come even close to being sinister . his performance was so good , i cannot see him in a movie without thinking of Hans gruber ( imagine watching love actually ! ! ) that's good acting for you and he has never been better ( robin hood was his last high point ) . people love this film because john is an everyday man who has everyday problems so people sympathise for him a lot more than if he was a musclebound force ( imagine Schwarzenegger in this role , or anyone ? ) and to complete the perfection of the movie it's set at Christmas one of the most emotional times of the year . i guess john was thinking ' how am i gonna save the day , get my wife back , and get my kids to love me ' great sound track too , gets your adrenaline pumping every time you watch it . a claustrophobic , taut , genre defining action movie that will stand the test of time and make Willis the legend he deserves to be .

After seeing Grindhouse , i thought it was only fair to watch each film separately . whilst watching grindhouse , i was looking more forward to death proof , than this , so really my mind wasn't that set on it . but after seeing the stand alone version , i have to admit this has to be ranked with Sin City as the directors best work to date . the film is amazingly mental and so over the top it's ridiculous , but this is where it's it's own worst enemy , the movie will fall into two categories , you will either love this film or you will hate it , i really believe that anyone will see this film and say ' it's okay ' because you will never have seen anything like this . plot wise , it's your usual Maguffin about some military group and some infection that has spread over Texas , and the survivors who carry the antidote . thats the premise . but the execution is where the gold is hidden and it wears it's Grindhouse moniker on it's sleeve . it's a dirty movie , it's over the top gore-narathon ( thats my trademark now ) that makes anything Roth or Zombie have made look tame . the cast are all exceptional and over the top , so over the top even Tarantinos performance is passable ! the script is laugh out loud funny and even though you will be confused at times , you just can't help but get carried away with the ride . it will be such a shame if this film goes un-noticed , it really does have to be seen , and as a stand alone film , for sheer ballsiness , it has to be one of the best escapist movies of the year , or really any year . but please remember , it's not serious , it's just a fun 111 minute ride . enjoy
538164	3717154	799954	10.0	one of the best documentaries i've ever seen . . .	People suffer largely unnoticed while the rest of the world goes about its business . This is a documentary exploration of the mythic beauty of the Golden Gate Bridge , the most popular suicide destination in the world , and those drawn by its call . . . there is something about this film that makes you realise how precious life is , and many people suffer while the rest of us , think their not right . it must have been a harrowing experience for the film makers watching the poor souls jump from the bridge and just watch helplessly . but it's not all depressing stuff , there is one story about a 20 year old who jumped , ans seriously believed that god saved him . other questions are asked , such as is it a sin to commit suicide ? many religious people will agree with the above quote , but the film does make you wonder if it is more of a sin to not lead the life you yearn for . people do have aspirations of becoming a success and fail , and with the beauty of the golden gate bridge , it must be to the jumpers some kind of poignant moment , knowing that they will end their life on one of the worlds most famous landmarks . what stands out the most in this , is the story of Gene , a guy who cried wolf for several years , and the camera focuses on his almost reaper like figure walking along the bridge , whist we see interviews with his friends about how he lived his life . the film is shocking and sometimes very hard to watch , but at the same time makes you appreciate just how short life is . the final shot of Gene falling is macabre , but almost graceful , as he just falls , whilst the others featured in the film jumped almost reluctantly . a very important piece of film and one of the best documentaries ever made .
