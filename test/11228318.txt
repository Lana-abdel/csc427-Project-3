453735	11228318	151993	1.0	Plane Dumb features the worst in racial stereotyping	While credited as a Tom and Jerry cartoon , this is not the cat-and-mouse team but an earlier Mutt-and-Jeff rip-off featuring them going to Africa and disguising themselves in the stereotypical burnt cork makeup to try to blend in . While the dialect humor is mostly lame , there is a brief musical sequence involving " black skeletons " that was entertaining . I have to ask however , how could Tom and Jerry still have their makeup stay on even after being dumped in the water a couple of times ? One of many entries produced by the Van Beuren Corporation for distribution by RKO Radio Pictures before RKO made a deal with Disney . Only worth seeing if you're an animation buff or is interested in how certain ethnicities were stereotyped as entertainment way back when .
454995	11228318	146965	2.0	Kisser Plant is a weird and boring Terrytoons short	Kisser Plant is a Terrytoons short starring Oscar , a human , and Astro Nut , a space creature . The title character is a gift from Astro Nut after Oscar tells him about wanting something for his garden . Problem is , the plant grows as big as a bean stalk and loves to kiss constantly including policemen and soldiers ! This is one weird cartoon that , unfortunately , doesn't provide any laughs , just repetition of the plant kissing everything in sight . And the ending can be predicted by anyone who's seen various other cartoons on Saturday morning or on the weekday afternoons in past decades before talk shows took over . Only recommended for anyone who feels a need to see all Terrytoons .
454829	11228318	233371	3.0	The version I saw of Boys Will Be Joys was abridged to one reel	This Hal Roach comedy short , Boys Will Be Joys , is the forty-second in the " Our Gang / Little Rascals " series . The version I saw was on Goodtimes ' VHS of " Our Gang Comedy Festival II " . It was a shortened one-reel version of an originally two-reel film . And since this version was handled by a company other than the original Hal Roach Studios or their distributor Pathe Exchange , the series title was " Those Lovable Scallawags with Their Gangs " with the episode title being " Carnival Time " . With the original H . M . Walker inter-titles removed , here's the synopsis , in my own words , I partly got from the definitive book on the " Our Gang / Little Rascals " series by Leonard Maltin and Richard W . Bann : While the gang has plans for a new amusement park in an acre of their choosing , the surveyor tells them it's being used for a future factory . Undeterred , they see the sixty-year-old president of the land-owning company who has the heart of a ten-year-old . After hearing the gang's story , he decides to make their dream come true and walks out on his own meeting ! The board of directors follow him hoping to get the chairman to agree to get him voted off . In the end , with the kids and some of the men helping in operating the makeshift rides , the president tells the board he's retiring and vows to think as young as the gang are . . . Not very amusing and the rides seem not to convincing as simply the creation of the kids-even with the financier's fun-loving aid . There is an interesting angle of a fluidly moving shot of a boy going backwards on a slide in a wheel-less vehicle that was partly fascinating . I was also amused by Farina's displaying of a " Wild Animal " in his tent-which turns out to be a skunk . Otherwise , Boys Will Be Joys was just an average " Our Gang " short .
454319	11228318	26150	3.0	Buddy of the Legion is another bland effort of a cartoon starring Buddy	Here's another cartoon starring Warner's blandest character : Buddy . In this one , Buddy gets hired to take care of a bookstore while the heavyset female boss leaves temporarily . When he looks at a book about the Foreign Legion , Buddy dreams he's there . . . Despite some good animation provided by Bob Clampett and Chuck Jones , this animated short feels rushed because of the limited running time of six minutes that doesn't serve whatever story you half expect when Buddy dreams of adventure while sleeping . And the time spent having the boy dusting in the bookstore isn't all that amusing . So on that note , I'd only recommend Buddy of the Legion if you're a Warner Bros . cartoon completist .
453767	11228318	63073	3.0	Hocus Pocus Powwow was an underwhelming late Warner Bros . cartoon for me	This is one of those late ' 60s Warner Bros . theatrical cartoons that uses new characters instead of the classic Bugs , Daffy , Porky , etc . The star here is Merlin the Magic Mouse whose W . C . Fields-inspired voice is done by Larry Storch of TV's " F Troop " fame . He does all the other voices here like that of Second Bannana and the Indian Lo . Perhaps because of the obvious low-budget look , this cartoon was mostly " eh " to me . Whatever funny gags provided here come courtesy of Lo , the Poor Indian . Like when he gets Merlin's hat and pulls the rabbit out of it with that hare biting him on the nose . Or when Lo gets off a cliff , stands for a few seconds , then falls with the scene changing to the ground from up high with the impact signaled by a small smoke ( reminiscent of the Road Runner cartoons with While E . ' s impact ) . Then we see Lo running on a treadmill which he calls , " Portable warpath " . LOL ! Otherwise , this was mostly blah for me .
454078	11228318	30300	3.0	Jungle Jitters was another of the " Censored 11 " I recently discovered	This is another of the " Censored 11 " Warner Bros . cartoons that I found on Thad's Animation Blog . Thad thinks most of the gags are stupid but since Friz Freling directed this , there are at least a few clever ones like the Looney Tunes Theme - " The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down " - being depicted with these cannibals going up-and-down on a pole in a circle with a tent-like roof and a few others whistling in unison or the tall humanized salesman getting punched in the stomach . Besides that , however , the stereotypical characterizations pretty much defeats whatever entertainment value this short once had and dated references to old-time radio stars doesn't help . And what's with one of the natives speaking in a pseudo-stereotypical broken Chinese English ? And why is their leader a white prissy queen drawn as a chicken ? And why does she see the dog salesman as humanized Clark Gable and Robert Taylor ? If you're a Warner cartoon completest , I'd recommend Jungle Jitters for one time viewing . Otherwise , stay away .
455001	11228318	150119	3.0	Stereotypical Chinese abound in Terrytoons ' Chop Suey	Just saw on YouTube an early talkie Terrytoons short called Chop Suey . It seems to be mostly a stereotypical depiction of the Chinese-here portrayed as rats-and the way they run their laundry . Most of what happens here doesn't really make sense though there are some amusing gags like the way some things are flattened as well as a few Rube Goldberg devices and I also liked one sequence of a female rat walking down the street with something on her head while an instrumental of " Ain't She Sweet " plays as a score . There's also some interesting shots of the top of a building that some people walk on with a car following them . Otherwise , worth skipping unless you're a Terrytoons completist .
454549	11228318	801157	3.0	Sycamore Lodge was a rare episode of Calvin and the Colonel I managed to see	Having just discovered a site called From the Archives , I checked the section called Net Nights and found an animated program called " Calvin and the Colonel " on it . It would be the last time " Amos ' n ' Andy " creators and players Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll would collaborate together . Gosden would play the Colonel as a fox with the personality of George " Kingfish " Stevens with Correll as a dim-witted bear named Calvin with that of Andy . In this episode , the Colonel , having purchased a cabin that turns out to have been flooded , tries to sublet it to Calvin while his wife and sister-in-law do the same thing to someone else . This is basically an animated radio show with music scoring limited to transition scenes . The low-budget shows on how limited the animation really is and the laugh track really points out how lame the whole package truly is . In fact , I only laughed two times . Once when the Colonel says , " I've soured on the whole sex ! " , sotto voce , after telling his wife and sister-in-law how he's never looked at another woman in the last 20 years he's lived with them and again when , after he and Calvin see water coming out of the stove , the Colonel says , " The last tenant must have baked a spongecake in there ! " Former " Amos ' n ' Andy " writers Joe Connelly and Bob Mosher , the creators of " Leave It to Beaver " and " The Munsters " , wrote the script . Paul Frees is one of the voices here . All in all , this was a curio that I was at least glad to finally be able to view .
454772	11228318	2663	3.0	Barney Oldfield's Race for a Life is mostly blah but interesting to see once	Having recently discovered the films of Mabel Normand and seen some of her great slapstick scenes with Roscoe " Fatty " Arbuckle , Barney Oldfield's Race for a Life was a big disappointment for me since Ms . Normand spends most of the short film tied onto railroad tracks because villain Ford Sterling didn't accept Mabel's rejection of his advances ( glad to see her do so by knocking him down , however ! ) . When her bashful boyfriend Mack Sennett finds out , he gets real-life race car driver Barney Oldfield to help him rush to her rescue . Also on hand are the Keystone Kops who get a hilarious scene at the end . Other than that and some of Mr . Sterling's over-the-top performance , this was mostly blah for me . Worth a look at least once for silent movie buffs . I saw this on YouTube with a score that contained some modern music from John Williams and other scores from recent movies and TV shows .
455152	11228318	146518	3.0	Krazy Kat , Bugologist is an interesting curio of the silent animation era	I agree with the previous reviewer that nothing really happens in this cartoon ( Krazy and Ignaz finds bee , thinks its dead , bee comes alive . Then elephant comes and is scared by Ignaz . The end . ) though its animation is pretty interesting for the era it occurred . The animator's name is Frank Moser who later was in partnership with Paul Terry when he formed Terrytoons in the ' 30s . Since 10 lines is required for me to finish this comment , I'll also say that before Felix the Cat , many animation stars originally came from comic strips like Krazy Cat and Ignaz , The Katzenjamer Kids , or Mutt and Jeff . It wasn't until King Features ' Popeye was adapted for animation by the Max Fleischer studio in the ' 30s , however , that a successful transition was made from newspaper page to the silver screen . But that probably wouldn't have happened without his predecessors I've just mentioned .
454358	11228318	146959	4.0	Kickapoo Juice was the final entry in Columbia's " Li'l Abner " animated series	Kickapoo Juice is the fifth and final entry in Columbia's attempt to make Al Capp's " Li'l Abner " comic strip into a cartoon shorts series . This one has Abner making a giant statue of his bachelor idols-Hairless Joe and Lonesome Polecat-to the consternation of Daisy Mae and his mother , Mammy Yokum . Yokum tries to fix her son's obsession with them by taking away their large pot of moonshine with the title name and ends up taking some of them herself . Chaos ensures . . . There's some outrageous gags here that were pretty amusing but it all fell apart in the end . While this was originally in Technicolor , the print I saw was in black and white . Animation was good for the ' 40s era but the story wasn't all that . I recommend this mainly for " Li'l Abner " completists and animation fans curious about Columbia's contributions to the genre before they started distributing UPA shorts .
455255	11228318	19701	5.0	Duke Ellington and Fredi Washington make Black and Tan an interesting curio	Having just seen Bessie Smith's only film appearance in the short St . Louis Blues , I'm startled by some of the same people from that one involved here as well : director Dudley Murphy , Alec Lovejoy in a bit part ( as one of the piano movers ) , and the Hall Johnson Choir . Also appearing is Fredi Washington , sister of Isabel Washington who also appeared in the aforementioned short . Fredi is the dancer girlfriend of pianist Duke Ellington whose film debut this is . Anyway , at the club where she's the dancing star with the Ellington Orchestra , she does some energetic dance steps before collapsing . Later , on her deathbed , she requests " Black and Tan Fantasy " as the Duke plays her request with her demise at the music ending proper as the screen blurs her point-of-view and fades to dark . Besides the good music , there's also some multiple-exposure shots and cuts under the glass floor and reflections of the close dance-stepping men on it that makes this a pretty fascinating curio of the early talkie era . I found Black and Tan-retitled Black and Tan Fantasy-on the Kino Video DVD " Hollywood Rhythm , Vol . 1 : The Best of Jazz & Blues .
454220	11228318	1039339	5.0	High School Musical was just an average episode of " Miss Guided "	Student Lauren ( Gina DeVivo ) tells Becky she's tired of " one-line " parts which reminds Becky of her high school days when she only played maids in musicals even when they didn't call for one like in " Jesus Chirst Superstar " . With the regular drama teacher out , Becky gets Principal Huffy to hire her to direct " Miss Saigon " . Meanwhile , Bruce fires his ad staff for not getting enough space in the papers for the play and gets Lisa to do the job . His ulterior motive , however , is to try to get as close as possible to her . Becky's first task on the play is to pick Lauren for the lead even though she can't sing and there's someone better . Obviously , Becky's trying to compensate for her days of being cast in demeaning parts . Furthermore , the budget goes over because of her perfectionist skill demands on sets which Tim is in charge of . This eventually puts a kibosh on a potential dinner date for them . Also , Lauren gets so insecure before showtime she quits meaning Becky now takes the lead even though the leading character is 19 years old ! This almost crosses legal territory when the teen playing the soldier tries to kiss Becky ! During the performance , Lisa , having come from a bad dinner date with her about-to-be-ex-husband , arrives drunk which Bruce tries to take advantage of . While they kiss in his office , Lisa then falls asleep so Bruce leaves her there . She wakes the next morning with Bruce wanting to talk about it but she tells him flat out they'll never be together . That doesn't faze Bruce . Principal Huffy gets a verbal agreement from Becky to not direct another play and , after Lauren apologizes to her for what she did , Becky , reading the bad review from the paper tells her that they both accomplished their dreams and found out they're not worth pursuing ! While there were some funny scenes like Becky's performance in " Miss Saigon " and Bruce's asides on his intentions of Lisa , there weren't enough to really make me really laugh out loud and I felt bad for the good singer ( who was also Asian ) who didn't get the lead and wished that Lauren had tried to go on during opening night . I also hope this is the last time Bruce tries to seduce Lisa since it wasn't that funny . So this was just an average episode of " Miss Guided " .
454770	11228318	4284	5.0	Mabel's Strange Predicament should satisfy some fans of early Chaplin	Mabel's Strange Predicament is the second film in which Charlie Chaplin dresses in costume as The Little Tramp ( the first being Kid Auto Races in Venice ) . In here , he's just a drunk who's infatuated with the title character played by Ms . Normand . She's a lady who has a dog that she takes with her to the hotel room where , after dressing in her pajamas , gets locked out of with dog still inside . After Charlie chases her upstairs , she goes to another room where an elderly man lives and hides under his bed . Also mixed up in this are her suitor and the elderly man's wife . Most of the highlights are from Mabel's under-bed hiding and the slapstick that ensues when she's found out as well as some of Chaplin's falls from either being hit or just simply staggering . Should be amusing enough for fans of early silent comedy and the two stars especially very curious Chaplin enthusiasts .
455080	11228318	338216	5.0	Lucky You is an uneven drama about poker	Spider-Man 3 was sold out so my friend and I chose to see Lucky You . The main story was between Eric Bana and Robert Duvall who plays Bana's father . They're both card playing gamblers who have an intense rivalry both inside and out of the poker table . Theirs are the most interesting scenes . Drew Barrymore as Bana's potential girlfriend is only partially effective . Other supporting players include Debra Messing as Barrymore's sister , Horatio Sanz as a guy who bets a golf game with Eric , Robert Downey Jr . , Charles Martin Smith , and , as the only female in the high stakes " World Series " poker tournament in the end , Jean Smart . Interesting depiction of card playing but very uneven as a drama , in fact I almost fell asleep a couple of times . . .
455008	11228318	410297	5.0	You have to be in the right mood to enjoy The Lake House	I just saw The Lake House with my mother and father . My dad left early on believing the movie was lousy . My mom and I stayed and while I understood most of what was going on , Mom kept getting confused until nearly the end . I think the ending was a little confusing for both Mom and me and it wasn't until I read many of the Q and A blogs that I understood both the timelines and why things happened at certain times . Both Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves are wonderful in their leading roles and Christopher Plummer and Shohreh Aghdashloo are equally good in their supporting ones . If you don't think too much about the logic of sequences , you may get carried away by the romance of the movie with the beautiful Chicago scenery . Me , I'm still wondering how it ended the way it did . . .
454080	11228318	67169	5.0	Guru , the Mad Monk was a pretty entertaining bad B-movie	I just went on Google Video to watch this , one of a double feature presented on Torgo's Drive-In ( the other feature being I Drink Your Blood which I have yet to see ) . At 56 minutes , I found this Andy Milligan-directed horror movie fascinating with the constant pounding score and Dragnet-like stilted dialogue abounding throughout . Having said that , I actually found the story pretty entertaining and I found myself partially caring for the sympathetic characters . Many of the gore scenes , while very amateurish , were also fun to watch in a can - you - believe - their - doing - this way . And having a hunchback that sometimes speaks clearly was also a hoot ! So on that note , I'm recommending Guru , the Mad Monk to bad movie buffs everywhere . P . S . On Torgo's Drive-In , this movie was preceded by some ads for the concession stand and previews of Carnival of Blood , The Thing with Two Heads , and Teenage Mother . Oh , and the print I saw had the synchronization off by several seconds .
454967	11228318	1131283	5.0	Homecoming is a little amusing first episode of " Miss Guided "	Having seen Judy Greer in movies like 13 Going on 30 , 27 Dresses , and TV shows like " Arrested Development " , " Love Monkey " , and " Two and a Half Men " , I was anxious to see her in her first starring role in the TV series " Miss Guided " . Here , she plays Becky Freeley , a former student at the high school she returns to as the new guidance counselor . Also on hand is former SNLer Chris Parnell as the vice principal , Kristoffer Polaha as the Spanish teacher Becky has a crush on , and Brooke Burns as Lisa , Becky's rival back then and now . Ms . Greer provides many amusing lines and does some good physical stuff . Parnell himself also steals some scenes . Judy's dialogue with some of the students , like the one she thinks has a crush on her , also has some moments . The whole thing seems uneven so far though , since the show can't make up its mind if we're supposed to laugh at or with the characters . Nonetheless , this seems like a good start for a promising series .
454729	11228318	33121	6.0	Swing Social is entertaining if a little politically incorrect	In this politically incorrect cartoon from 1940 , a black preacher on Sunday has caught a black fisherman not going to church . He then tells of why black fish don't bite on the sabbath as we are treated to a musical sequence of Negro fish singing about the devil and what he represents and how to defeat him . I suppose one should be relieved that the human black characters are only seen from the neck down though there's still some of the mangled English dialect to deal with . The music is for the most part entertaining and mostly avoids stereotyping ( brief fried chicken sequence notwithstanding ) . Certainly worth seeing for anyone who loves swing music and loves all ' 30s and ' 40s animation styles . Directed by Rudolf Ising who previously created Bosko with Hugh Harmon .
454632	11228318	142894	6.0	The Tail of the Monkey was an interesting look at some early silent Lantz	Here's another Walter Lantz cartoon short I found on the CartoonsOnFilm blog . In this one , which he co-directed with David Hand , Lantz plays an organ grinder whose monkey steals a girl's lollipop in the live-action sequences . To keep the girl from crying , the organ grinder tells of why the monkey keeps moving his tail as we fade in to an animated version of the tale as the monkey fixes a horseshoe while his long tail gets burned on a grill ( why it's cooking nothing in particular is not explained ) . That tail also gets caught in a cheese-shaped mousetrap as tricked by a mouse who lives inside and holds the monkey up on a tree branch as he tries to make a giant hippo ring by 5 : 15 since his assistant went out to lunch at 5 ! The gags I just described are amusing in their primitive way in the animation and it's just fascinating just looking at what passed for movie cartoons back in the day . The Tail of the Monkey was an Unnatural History series entry for The J . R . Bray Studio where Lantz was an employee at the time . Worth a look for any animation buff out there .
454455	11228318	41513	6.0	Intruder in the Dust was somewhat interesting to me	Having read the William Faulkner novel and now seen the movie version twice , I have to admit Intruder in the Dust leaves me a little underwhelmed . Perhaps it's the lack of real tension as well as that of a music score ( though it's interesting that a movie made in the late ' 40s would-except for the beginning and end credits-have no score at all since I always thought that started in the ' 70s ) . I personally found the novel a bit pretentious with all the run-on sentences . The most tension for me came when one of the murdered man's brothers poured gas near an old lady's rocking chair in the building that's jailing accused man Lucas Beauchamp and started lighting a match only to blow it out when that lady ( Elizabeth Patterson ) refused to move an inch . Other scenes , like the digging of the grave , seemed to take too long . Other than that , I did like the performances of Claude Jarman , Jr . as the teenage boy who's trying to pay back Lucas for saving him a few years ago , David Brian as the lawyer uncle of Jarman reluctantly defending Beauchamp , and Juano Hernadez as the accused man who bows to no one . This being Black History Month , I'd also like to mention other performers of color to appear here : Julia S . Marshbanks as Beauchamp's wife , John Morgan as a black convict , and Elzie Emanuel as Jarman's friend . And I recognized Will ' Grandpa Walton ' Geer's voice as the sheriff . I guess what I really found a little puzzling was , when the truth came out , everyone seemed to just walk away as if nothing happened . The fact that Jarman and Brian provide some explanation at the end makes the movie somewhat satisfying . For all that , I guess I'm recommending Intruder in the Dust . P . S . I'd also like to mention that two of the performers-David Clarke and Harry Antrim-were both born in the same place I was : Chicago , Illinois .
453743	11228318	19714	6.0	Bosko the Talk-Ink Kid is interesting pilot for Warner Bros . cartoon series	Bosko the Talk-Ink Kid is Hugh Harmon and Rudy Ising's pilot film for an animated series they were shopping to various studios after working on the Oswald the Lucky Rabbit shorts for Disney and Mintz . Independent producer Leon Schlesinger accepted the pilot and commissioned a series of Bosko Looney Tunes shorts for distribution by Warner Bros . In this initial entry , Ising is at the drawing board drawing a little black figure . This figure's first line is , " Well , I'm glad to be free now that I'm out of the pen . " He then whistles and tap dances . He then asks for a piano which Ising obliges . Bosko plays and sings " Sonny Boy " but awfully ! Having covered his ears , Rudy can't stand it anymore and sends Bosko back into his pen with the piano and stool . After putting the ink back in the inkwell , Bosko comes back out and says , " So long , folks ! " The end title also says what Bosko just said starting the Warner Bros . tradition of ending the shorts with something other than The End . Amusing pilot for the Bosko series and an interesting start for the Warner Bros . cartoon studio . While the title character has something of a Negro dialect , there's nothing really offensive about him unless you consider a young black boy tap dancing as such . Certainly a nice tribute to Max Fleischer's Koko the Clown series . Worth seeing for animation buffs especially those of Warner Bros . cartoons .
453955	11228318	126048	6.0	So You Want to Be a Detective was my first look at the shorts series character Joe McDoakes	On the Matinée at the Bijou site , there was an article about a series of short films that featured a character named Joe McDoakes . George O'Hanlon-later known as the voice of George Jetson on Hanna-Barbera's " The Jetsons " - played this character . In this version , he becomes private eye Philip Snarlow as he and narrator Art Gilmore search for a killer . Many of the visual and verbal gags got some chuckles if not big guffaws from me . Maybe I was a little distracted by the feminine charms ( not to mention the shapely figure ) of Veronica Vacuum , played here by exquisitely sexy Lila Leeds . It's a wonder the Production Code let her on the screen ! Anyway , while no great shakes , So You Want to Be a Detective is worth a look .
454198	11228318	396555	6.0	Meet the Robinsons is amusing in 3-D from Disney	Containing some elements you'll recognize from Back to the Future and The Wizard of Oz , Meet the Robinsons is a charming and amusing 3-D computer animated movie . A 12-year orphan has failed to get adopted more than 100 times because he keeps inventing things that always result in disaster . Then one day , someone a year older from the future takes him on a journey there in a time machine as he meets the Robinson family who provide him all the joy lacking in his present time . I'll stop right there and say while there is a rushed quality in the first 30 minutes , things slow down eventually to the point that you're left feeling inspired at the end . Wish the movie could be funnier but I wasn't completely disappointed . By the way , there is a punchline involving a Famous Celebrity that pays off at the end that I don't want to spoil here . And it's preceded by Working for Peanuts , an amusing Donald Duck / Chip ' n ' Dale cartoon that was also in 3-D when it first came out in 1953 . What awesome visuals both films had !
454185	11228318	554	6.0	Humorous Phases of Funny Faces is a historically interesting early animation effort	I don't think there's anything more about this pioneering animation effort that hasn't already been said before by many of the other reviewers except maybe only the very young who haven't been exposed to cartoons previously would find this the most charming thing they have ever seen yet ! Certainly we all recognize how primitive these chalk drawings are now having been exposed to Disney , The Simpsons , hell , even Beavis and Butthead is more sophisticated than this short Humorous Phases of Funny Faces ! That said , anyone with an interest in animation's history should watch this at least once to see where it all began . . .
454335	11228318	150100	6.0	Chew Chew Baby is one Famous Studios cartoon that should probably have a " parental guidance " caution	Just saw on the Something Old , Something New blog this Famous Studios Noveltoon , Chew Chew Baby ( not to be confused with the same-named Woody Woodpecker cartoon ) . In this one , a hunter from Cincinatti encounters a little pygmy in a jungle , takes his picture , and tells him to look him up if he ever goes to his hometown . He does and , oh , what a surprise he pulls on him . . . The author of the blog I just mentioned says this traumatized him as a kid and he's had no desire to see this again . Having now watched this as linked from YouTube , I must say I was mostly amused by the bizarre chomping of this small cannibal especially when he upchucked that mannequin ! Then there's a twist at the end that you'll probably guess right away just as it's about to happen that was a perfect end of this short . This probably wouldn't be suitable for anyone under-12 but anyone older than that who's seen The Silence of the Lambs and was entertained by that will probably enjoy this as well . P . S . Jackson " Bluto " Beck was the voice of the hunter and Jack " Popeye " Mercer was the dentist who was the first of the pygmy's victims .
454171	11228318	148197	6.0	The Fuz was another interesting Ralph Bakshi cartoon from Paramount Cartoon Studios	Just found this Ralph Bakshi-directed cartoon from Paramount Cartoon Studios on the Saturday Morning Blog as linked from Daily Motion . A lady is scared of a little furry person all covered in hair who seems harmless ( must be a comment on normal people fearing hippies since this short was made in the late ' 60s ) . Superblaster and his sidekick Bob overhear this as Superblaster tries to get out but the landlady stops him at the door to get her money . When the superhero tries to feign being broke , the landlady pummels him until he pays all the money . When he reaches the little furball , Superblaster keeps bumping into things while the furball just stands still and goes its own way . . . This being another Bakshi cartoon made in the waning days of Paramount's animation unit , this take on another possible variation of Ralph's " Mighty Heroes " from Terrytoons starts pretty funny enough with the hysterical woman's screams , her small husband , and that furball character and continues with Superblaster's inept ways of handling himself initially but it runs out of steam before the amusing surprise ending which redeems the short a bit . On that note , The Fuz is worth a look for Bakshi enthusiasts .
454359	11228318	152262	6.0	Sadie Hawkin's Day marked the first time " Li'l Abner " was brought to the silver screen	Sadie Hawkin's Day was the first of five Columbia cartoons to feature Al Capp's comic strip creation , " Li'l Abner " . To anyone who doesn't know about the title's reason for being , here's an explanation : Ms . Hawkin was a homely girl whose father , being somewhat near-sighted , was puzzled why no one wanted to marry his , to him , pretty daughter . So he had a contest involving all the unmarried men running to avoid Sadie's clutches with the one caught by her " winning " her hand . Since then , this became an annual thing with many unmarried women attempting to catch a bachelor for her own . Abner , as always , is trying to avoid Daisy Mae from her catching him ( though I find myself wondering why as she's quite a looker who would be great in the hay ! ) . Anyone who's read the comic strip knows their eventual fate but it's fun watching Abner and Daisy Mae , and many of the other contestants , running around like marathon runners trying to avoid / catch each other . This was a nice start for the short-lived series though I'm sure even then there were some limitations that prevented a long run for this comic-to-screen translation . Still , for all that , Sadie Hawkin's Day is worth a look for " Li'l Abner " fans as well as those interested in Columbia Pictures animation .
454307	11228318	2851	6.0	Fatty Joins the Force has some amusing slapstick touches	Before I begin the review , I'd like to note that Dot Farley plays Fatty's wife here and that Edgar Kennedy played a cop in the beginning of this short . I'm noting this because Farley and Kennedy would later team up in a series of shorts for RKO in the forties in which Dot would portray Edgar's mother-in-law . With that out of the way , let me say this was a pretty amusing short in which Fatty joins the police force after saving the commissioner's pre-teen daughter from drowning in a lake . Now in uniform , he finds he's not so respected when he runs afoul of some teen boys who hit him on the face with mud pies and then take his clothes off when he goes for a swim . Cops find his uniform and think he is dead while Fatty , in just long underwear , attracts unwanted attention from ladies who call for help to other cops who arrest him . It all goes downhill from there . . . Pretty amusing slapstick involving the teen boys , other policemen , and subsequent humiliation from his " mourners " . Old hat today but worth a look for silent movie comedy fans .
454601	11228318	22110	6.0	The Male Man was another interesting Max Fleischer cartoon	Just found this obscure Max Fleischer cartoon on the Uncle John's Crazy Town blog . The author of it claims this is the greatest cartoon ever made . Well , like most Fleischer cartoons from the early ' 30s , there are lots of stream-of-conscious gags here . They are related by Bimbo's adventures as a mailman . Among the gags I liked : Seeing the face of a stamp lick his sticky bottom ( of the stamp ! ) on the envelope , having the envelope given to Bimbo by some skeletal ghouls ( don't ask ! ) enlarge as he keeps walking , and seeing a silhouette of a dancing lady underwater ( again don't ask ! ) which is revealed to be an octopus's legs ! Not too many funny gags other than those I just mentioned . So while I don't think this was the greatest cartoon ever , The Male Man still provides some amusement for a Fleischer cartoon .
454232	11228318	85384	6.0	Curse of the Pink Panther was pretty entertaining despite no Sellers and the fate of his character here	Filmed right after Trail of the Pink Panther , Curse of the Pink Panther continues the storyline of finding both Chief Inspector Clouseau and the Pink Panther diamond . Since Dreyfus , however , would rather Clouseau was never found , he has someone from jail tell him how to fix it so a HAL-like computer finds the opposite of best detective in the world . That opposite would be Clifton Sleigh ( Ted Wass ) from New York City . Meanwhile , a Countess Chandra ( Joanna Lumley in her second consecutive Panther role ) has the diamond and , it seems , an affair with a certain police detective . . . All right , I'll just say this right now : I didn't like the way Clouseau ended up in this movie being an accomplice to the Pink Panther theft and changing his face as well . I can't believe this is the way he would have behaved considering his sworn oath to upload the law ( or luw ) . Having said that , I was very amused when he ended up looking like Roger Moore and how perfect was he when he did the Clouseau voice ! Okay , moving on-I wasn't crazy about Sleigh when they first showed him disguising as a hooker in New York . Then he showed up at a Chicago airport during a windy storm with his umbrella almost swept up in it and I laughed a little . What got me on his side was that hilarious scene with an inflatable woman provided by Balls ( Harvey Korman again ) taking place at an outside French restaurant with once again another hilarious performance by the versatile Graham Stark as a bored waiter who can't keep his eyes off of the doll and Sleigh's attempts at blowing her up . There was also a hilarious fight scene between Clifton , some gangsters led by Robert Loggia , and a woman he just met named Juleta Shane-real name Julie Morgan ( Leslie Ash ) who later tries to bed Sleigh . Oh , and Korman was only fitfully amusing as Balls here though I did like the way he said " ca-ca " . And besides David Niven and Capucine , it was nice to see Robert Wagner also show up as Niven's nephew George Lytton who's also from The original Pink Panther . One more appearance I was pleasantly surprised by was that of Pat Corley-best known to me as Phil the bartender on " Murphy Brown " - as Sleigh's frustrated superior in New York . He sounded different here but I recognized him just the same . Herbert Lom as Dreyfus still provides some laughs but Burt Kwouk as Cato was mostly wasted here especially when he wrestles with the American Sleigh at the now-Clouseau Museum apartment . So I guess overall , I really enjoyed Curse of the Pink Panther despite the absence of Sellers and what Edwards did with his character . Oh , and I wasn't crazy about the animated beginning credit sequence from Marvel Productions this time around though as always , the Henry Mancini theme is way cool . One more note : This was Niven's final film appearance as well as the final Panther stint for Andre Maranne as Sgt . Francois Duval . Since this movie bombed ( or buumbed ) , you'd think Edwards was through with the Pink Panther series once and for all . Once again , you'd be wrong . P . S . Edwards ' stepdaughter Emma Walton is an angry hooker here and his son Geoffrey ( who also co-wrote the screenplay ) is the voice of the computer Aldous . Next up , Son of the Pink Panther . . .
453971	11228318	23830	7.0	Bosko in Person is pretty entertaining musically	Bosko in Person takes place entirely on a stage where he and Honey perform songs , musical instrumentals , and singing celebrity impersonations . I recognized Bosko's Jimmy Durante but I don't know who Honey was impersonating when she sang in a big , brassy , voice . Music director Frank Marsales keeps things moving to a nice jazzy beat throughout with a fine patriotic finish and a nice illustration of President Franklin Roosevelt on drums at the end . Bosko in Person is one of many Harmon-Ising ( harmonizing , get it ? ) cartoons made for Leon Schlesinger starring the monkey-like character for Warner Bros . in the early thirties before they left for greener pastures at MGM . When they took Bosko there with them , he would emerge into a different character . . .
454480	11228318	23831	7.0	Bosko the Musketeer is a highly amusing musical cartoon short	Since the previous reviewer mentioned many of the things I was going to describe , I'll just mention two things : 1 ) Before the sword fight starts , the swords are shaking hands . 2 ) The little mice all look like Mickey ! Maybe not so surprising at all since Hugh Harmon and Rudolf Ising were previously animators for Walt Disney when he created Oswald the Lucky Rabbit ( Oswald looked like the Famous Mouse with long ears and a fluffy tail ) . Another highly amusing early Warner Bros . Looney Tunes short with tuneful music and singing throughout though that tends to get repetitious after a while . Good thing when Tex Avery arrived several years later , gags would be more important than music . Still , highly worth a look for anyone interested in early Warner Bros . cartoons before the arrival of Porky , Daffy , and Bugs .
455150	11228318	21812	7.0	Down South is an obviously Steamboat Willie-inspired Toby the Pup cartoon	I just saw this Toby the Pup cartoon mistakenly identified as an Aesop Fables short from Van Beuren on YouTube . Down South seems to have been inspired by Walt Disney's Steamboat Willie which isn't surprising since the lead character seems to be a Mickey Mouse ripoff developed by Walt's former boss , Charles Mintz . Of course , Mickey himself is a steal from Oswald the Lucky Rabbit that Walt created for Mintz . Oswald by this time was given to Walter Lantz by the studio that owned the character , Universal . Moving on , Toby is a steamboat captain who has to keep smiling when welcoming passengers . A monkey with a long tail on a tightrope helps keep that smile coming ! His girlfriend , Cathy , keeps things entertaining when she does her rendition of " Mississippi Mud " , a song I learned for a musical play about the south as a kid . Many wonderfully surreal gags abound that kept me amused if not laughing . Worth a look for anyone interested in early animation .
454846	11228318	141010	7.0	Felix All Puzzled pretty good Felix the Cat entry	Felix won't get fed by his owner until he solves the last word in his crossword puzzle which is vertical , a seven-letter word for something found chiefly in Russia . Felix gets himself kicked by another animal in order to get to the Soviet Union and immediately is thought of as a spy when he sneaks into a house of a couple of cossacks . He gets chased constantly until he manages to get kicked back to his homeland where his owner asked if he found the crossword answer . " Nope , " replies Felix , " all I found in Russia was trouble . " " Trouble " turns out to be the answer as Felix and his owner both laugh . The End . Pretty amusing and very short entry in the Felix canon . Worth seeing for the cat completists . Update / 08 : I found a more uncensored version on Matinée At The Bijou as linked to YouTube . It might have been some stereotypical Russian gags that was edited out when I first saw this two years ago . Anyway , the ratings the same .
454433	11228318	1031330	7.0	The List is another exciting episode of " Bionic Woman "	In this episode , Jamie is assigned to Paris with a CIA operative . Jonas lets her pick Tom from her last assignment to be her partner . They continue their flirting in the French city just before Tom gets in big trouble . Jamie gets pulled before she can rescue him but once again gets Jonas to cooperate . Jonas himself gets a call from Jamie's younger sister Becca as she gets in trouble with the police having just left a potential boyfriend caught with another girl at a party . . . Once again , some of the fun that wasn't in previous episodes is in this one mostly due to the banter between Jamie and Tom . Miquel Ferrer is also more of a benevolent figure here in the way he treats Jamie and Becca . While the backstory of the caper didn't interest me that much , I loved the gradual quick chases that made this episode so much exciting . Can't wait for the next episode so until then . . .
454053	11228318	587539	7.0	Mr . Big marks a very amusing beginning for the classic comedy series " Get Smart "	In this , the pilot episode of " Get Smart " , CONTROL agent Maxwell Smart ( Don Adams ) gets a call from the Chief ( Edward Platt ) to rescue a scientist who's invented something that's in the hand of the criminal organization called KAOS . He is to meet Agent 99 ( Barbara Feldon ) at a certain place . From there , the fun begins . . . With today being the general release day of the new movie version of " Get Smart " with Steve Carell in the title role , I thought I'd finally watch the very first episode of this classic television comedy series that Mel Brooks and Buck Henry created some 43 years ago . And yes , there's a " and " instead of a " with " in the writing credits when the two get credited here . This is where we first see the shoe phone and the cone of silence , hear Max's famous lines " And loving it ! " and " Would you believe . . . " ( while Smart says sorry a few times , there's no " . . . about that , Chief ! " yet ) And it's here that he-and we-first see 99 and though we know it's a woman , Max doesn't realize it yet since she's in uniform with a cap on . Plenty of funny lines abound with some of my favorites during the cone of silence sequence which turns into a " Who's on First ? " - type of confusion dialogue concerning the number " 57 " and " Hong Kong " . Also loved the code sentence being about the Mets winning so when Max hears a little boy say it , he asks if he's 99 . " No , I'm six and a half , " comes the reply . And then there's the meeting with Mr . Big . . . If there's some quibble here , it's that 99 seems a bit too kowtowed to Max for my tastes and the fights are soooo fake here . Still , this was quite an entertaining beginning for the beloved comedy series that lasted five seasons on the air . P . S . Was that female enemy agent called Zelinka named after executive producer Leonard Stern's former writing partner Sydney Zelinka when they wrote for " The Honeymooners " ?
454224	11228318	1039340	7.0	Rebel Yell was another good episode of " Miss Guided "	When vice principal Terry throws a punk band off the school yard , Becky recognizes the leader as someone who used to wear Cosby sweaters ( " You're my ' Cos " ) . Since Spring Break is arriving , Terry and Principal Huffy want the teaching staff to stay the night on grading papers . Guidance counselor Becky was just going to " sponge-paint " her office during that time but decides hanging out with Lisa and , especially , Tim would be more fun . So during their time checking papers , all three have chips even though they're in a room where no outside snacks are allowed . Then they have pizza and beer in the cafeteria kitchen which results in a Breakfast Club dance reenactment complete with them running when Terry tries to catch them . In hiding from him , Lisa and Tim go one way while Becky uses her knowledge of Bruce's secret entrance code to vandalize his office . Bad idea as he found out from a stuffed animal monitor of his but promises not to tell if she supports his security proposal to Huffy . She initially does but changes her mind when the punk rock student is threatened with punishment by Bruce for " looking like one who would vandalize his office " . So with Bruce's bodyguard's help , Huffy watches Becky's mischief in the vice principal's office on computer and makes her take charge of the Saturday detention class . Since Becky didn't reveal Lisa and Tim's contribution and vice versa , Tim shows up at detention to keep Becky company . . . Another amusing episode of " Miss Guided " with nice dialogue between Becky , Tim , and Lisa and excellent reenactment of the Breakfast Club montage . Maybe a bit more contrived that usual , but hey , what a good " wishful thinking " scenario with the three leads getting along so well together for once . Looking forward to seeing the rest of the episodes so on that note . . .
454528	11228318	1008002	7.0	Three-hour Live Earth on NBC had mostly enjoyable musical performances	Just finished watching the Live Earth three-hour concert version that I taped from NBC last weekend . Performance highlights include : John Mayer's " We Keep Waiting for the World to Change " , a reunited Genesis ' " Land of Confusion " , Alicia Keys ' " Mercy , Mercy , Me " which blended into Corrine Bailey Rae's version in the middle of the song , Kelly Clarkson's " Since You've Been Gone " , Roger Waters ' version of his group Pink Floyd's " Another Brick in the Wall " ( though I was surprised at it's inclusion ) and the recently reunited Police's " Message in a Bottle " . There were also good performances from Madonna , Bon Jovi , Trisha Yearwood and Garth Brooks , The Dave Matthews Band , The Black-Eyed Peas , and Duran Duran . Additionally , they showed snippets of musical acts in China , Japan , and Australia ( which showed an edited version of Crowded House's " Don't Dream It's Over " that I was disappointed with ) . All that plus hosts Ann Curry and Carson Daly interviewing public figures like Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Al Gore ( Curry ) and musicians like Keys and Matthews and actors like Rosario Dawson and Cameron Diaz ( Daly ) . All in all , a mostly enjoyable concert with important pro-environmental messages spread throughout ending with a clip of James Blunt singing " What a Wonderful World " .
454878	11228318	18150	7.0	Oswald the Lucky Rabbit in The Mechanical Cow is amusing	The Mechanical Cow is the first Oswald the Lucky Rabbit cartoon I've ever seen . If the plot seems familiar , maybe because it's done by Walt Disney before he lost Oswald to the character's copyright owners and started his own studio to create Mickey Mouse . The rabbit gets waken by an alarm clock who punches him in the face . He then tries to wake the title character who takes awhile . When they're both up they ride into town and come across a hippo mother and baby . Oswald feeds the baby with a giant bottle he takes from the mechanical cow's " body " and , with a tube attached , siphons it to the baby . Oswald then visits his rabbit girlfriend and he shoos the cow away so they can be alone together . Moments later , the girlfriend gets kidnapped by some dogs ( I think ) and the cow comes back to help Oswald rescue her . They find the kidnappers who chase after them after the girlfriend is rescued . Oswald , the girlfriend , and the cow stop at a cliff and wait for the kidnappers to fall into a pit of sharks below before the rabbit , his girlfriend , and cow ride off into the sunset . The end . Amusing from beginning to end . If you're interested in Disney's pre-Mickey creations , this Oswald short is highly recommended !
454333	11228318	910936	7.0	Pineapple Express is another quite funny Judd Apatow production	Since tomorrow is the birthday of my friend who works at a movie theatre , I let him pick the movie we were going to see today . He picked this one ( I'm just glad he didn't pick the third Mummy movie ) . Once again produced by Judd Apatow , this is star Seth Rogan and Evan Goldberg's second screenplay after Superbad from last year . I actually liked this one better than that especially when the " witnessing the murder " sequence kicked in . There are some scenes though that , while they might be funny , later makes me wonder what relation they have to the plot . Like the beginning black and white scene that takes place in 1937 with Apatow regular and current SNLer Bill Hader . He is indeed funny in his scene but before that , I wondered if I stumbled into the wrong movie . Rogen himself , though , is throughly deadpan hilarious whether nonchalantly romancing his 18-year-old high school girlfriend at her learning center or straight-out telling her parents ( Ed Begley , Jr . and former SNLer Nora Dunn ) during dinner about being chased by some hit men . And his former co-star from " Freaks and Geeks " , James Franco , matches Seth in offbeat humor whether driving a police car with his foot stuck in the windshield or helping his buddy in untying while he's also in likewise situation . And then there's a third party that manages to stay alive despite being shot at a lot . The stuff with the Asian hit men and Gary Cole and cop Rosie Perez as lovers seems so much filler though they have their moments too . So in summation , Pineapple Express may be a little long but that length provides a pretty satisfying whole for me to recommend .
454028	11228318	29950	7.0	Cecil B . DeMille's The Buccaneer is a rousing historical epic	Having just moved back to Baton Rouge , La . in 2003 after living in Jacksonville , Fla . for the previous 16 years , I started getting reacquainted with the history of the state I had first lived much of my life from age 7 to 19 . One of those sources was from this Cecil B . DeMille account of Louisiana's pirate-hero Jean Lafitte . It was he and his men who helped General Andrew Jackson with his troops defeat the British at The Battle of New Orleans . This was in exchange for a full pardon for him and his men after originally getting a price on his head from the Governor of The Pelican State . Fredric March makes a dashing Lafitte with Akim Tamiroff splendid as his sidekick Dominique . Margot Grahame is Lafitte's fiancée while Franciska Gaal is the Dutch girl Gretchen who falls for Jean after walking the plank from another ship that was lead by a man who betrayed Lafitte . Walter Brennan is funny here as Peavey , a sidekick to General Jackson ( Hugh Sothern ) . Watch what happens when he and Tamiroff have a scene together ! Because of some of the accents and the speed of some of the dialogue , I couldn't understand everything that was said but most of the time it was the action that got to me , especially when the American military men initially were attacking Lafitte's men as they were about to welcome them . Grahame and Gaal had their own feminine charms that made either one good chemistry with March so whichever one ended up with him would have been fine . I think I've said enough so I'll just say for anyone who loves a good old-fashioned story with some history thrown in , I highly recommend Cecil B . DeMille's The Buccaneer .
454255	11228318	31828	7.0	The Proud Valley is one of Paul Robeson's finest achievements	In reviewing the achievements of African-Americans on film in chronological order for Black History Month , we're now at 1940 with the entry of The Proud Valley , considered by star Paul Robeson as his favorite . In this one , he's an American named David Goliah coming to Wales to find a job . After hearing his voice from outside the window while conducting his chorus in rehearsal , Mr . Parry ( Edward Chapman ) manages to convince David to sing in his choir and gets him a job at the mines where he also works . His son , Emlyn ( Simon Lack ) also works there and is engaged to Gwen Owen ( Janet Johnson ) . I'll stop there and mention that Robeson is in fine form musically especially when he sings " Deep River " that sends chills down the spine . Perhaps because of his color , his character is sometimes in the background but by the end he does become essential . So for him , I'd definitely recommend The Proud Valley .
454533	11228318	1058907	7.0	Last aired Creature Comforts episode was amusing enough	In this , the last " Creature Comforts " episode that aired on CBS , there's some small clips of various animals mentioning what celebrities they look like . I liked it when one of the lobsters said he was told he looked like Charles Atlas ( that muscle guy in the comic book ads that I remember from the ' 70s ) ! Then in Winter , we see a groundhog trying to analyze the weather just before seeing his shadow then he runs back to his treehouse ! Also , a male horse discusses spooning with his female mate before that mate asks what he's talking about ! In The Zoo , a gorilla says he wants porn ! And so ends another segment of ordinary people's voices coming out of clay-animated animals ' mouths for the last time due to low ratings . Not as funny as the last two episodes but still amusing enough . Hope to see something again from the creators of Wallace and Gromit real soon . Until next time . . .
454368	11228318	893453	7.0	Godsend is a welcome continuation of Heroes in the new year	It's been two weeks in TV time since the last episode as we open with Peter in a hospital bed . Watching him rest are his brother Nathan and their mom . Simone comes by and brings flowers . Claire is in the kitchen with her father pretending to have little memory of the day her former cheerleader friend Jackie was killed . Back at school , she encounters Zack and tries to refresh his memory of their unique friendship but Zack has no recall . Niki has had a hard time in jail , especially whenever Jessica appears as D . L . and son Micah try to cope without her . Mohinder finds out Eden was once known as Sara Issacs and that her dead body is somewhere in Canada . Matt and his partner try to infiltrate Horn-Rimmed Glasses ' workplace in order to find Syler but all they find is paper . And Hiro and Ando are in the Mueseum of Natural History in New York as Hiro discovers a sword of a Japanese legend and attempts to take it in order to get full powers back . Meanwhile , Peter has dreams of destroying New York and gets out of the hospital to find a man from those dreams who claims to be invisible . Nathan and Simone later go to Issac's apartment where they find Issac who tells Simone he's now clean and that he's still in love with her . Hiro and Ando arrive at this time and mention while they have the sword , it's a fake and someone named Linderman has the real one . . . What I've just mentioned are mainly set-ups for many exciting encounters that will happen in future episodes . Nice scenes between Claire and Zack as they reenact his filming her stunt from the pilot episode . Funny use of Hiro in using his reduced powers during the sword-taking scene . Also humorous was Matt's telling his wife about his mind-reading abilities . Touching scene of Niki and her son before Jessica took over and got herself abducted by the guards . And interesting scenes between HRG and Mohinder about a possible , if reluctant on Mohinder's part , team-up . Lots to think about before the next episode . And I'll be waiting with bated breath . . .
454072	11228318	928267	7.0	Run ! is another compelling episode of Heroes	Last week , we found out Claire's bio-dad was Nathan Petrelli . He offers the bio-mom lots of money which she accepts . Hiro and Ando offer to help a Vegas showgirl in exchange for info to Linderman's whereabouts . Jessica is assigned by Linderman to assassinate a Mr . Malsky who is guided by Matt as a newly hired guard . Mohinder calls a Zane Taylor in Virginia Beach , Virginia and offers to come over but Sylar gets there first . Claire's adopted mom gets a big headache from possibly HRG's constant mind wipings . Claire overhears Petrelli and her bio-mom but doesn't show herself as she throws a rock at Nathan's car as he leaves . Hiro and Ando sneak into showgirl's ex-partner's room to get her purse but Hiro leaves quickly while Ando is stuck under bed while showgirl's ex-partner sits . Hiro overhears showgirl's phone call about lying to the boys and gets punched by her then gets locked in while Ando goes with her outside . An agent gets Hiro out . Jessica knocks Matt out a window but Matt recovers after landing on ledge . Malsky is killed , however . Matt does recover suitcase of diamonds and is about to give them to police then changes his mind when he hears in their heads what they think of him . Mohinder arrives at Taylor's house and unknowingly gets Syler who demonstrates Taylor's powers that he stole-turning metal into liquid . HRG has grounded Claire because she skipped school . Clair's adopted mom can no longer remember her life . And Jessica has a new assignment-Kill Nathan Petrelli . . . Pretty exciting though still slow-moving . Hope the New York explosion comes soon so there can be some real action . I thought Matt was a goner for a while when he was unconscious on that ledge . Still love Hiro and Ando's exchanges about heroism . Claire gets more suspicious of her adopted dad . Syler sure has fooled Mohinder . Until next time . . .
454598	11228318	150543	7.0	Fido Beta Kappa is another Famous Studios cartoon written by Irv Spector that I'd recommend	This is yet another Irv Spector-written cartoon from Famous Studios that I just found-this time on Cartoon Brew as linked from YouTube . In this one , the dog is no use to the master ( he mistakenly gives said master a tree branch instead of his rifle when they're confronted by a bear ) so that master threatens to send him to the dog pound . Instead , the dog begs to go to college so he gets sent to Dog Gone U . After graduation , that dogs talks more proper and proves smarter than the master when he's tested in safe guarding , duck hunting , and lightning spotting . Well , about that last one . . . Not as hilarious as the last two Spector-Famous cartoons I reviewed but funny enough that I enjoyed it . The last gag was especially hilarious though a bit more shockingly violent than I'd expect from a ' 50s cartoon . So for that , I recommend Fido Beta Kappa .
454663	11228318	27273	7.0	Thelma Todd shines in last short performance	This is the last short Thelma Todd did with Patsy Kelly before her death from mysterious circumstances . All-American Toothache concerns an upcoming college football game that will be lost unless quarterback ( and former Our Ganger ) Mickey Daniels passes his dentistry exam which hinges on his getting a wisdom tooth . Todd and Kelly are waitresses who work in a nearby diner that many of Daniels ' teammates go to . When they mention to Todd their troubles concerning Mickey , Todd manages to convince Kelly ( without telling her why ) to have her wisdom tooth pulled . As they sit in the waiting room , they hear drills so loud that Patsy almost leaves before coming to where the drills were from and finding out that they were overhearing two men trying to fix a sink ! The actual dentist , Mickey's teacher , is puzzled when Thelma tells him they want his student , not him . This results in a mix-up between Mickey's teammates and his fellow dental students . Very amusing banter between Thelma and Patsy and hilarious performance from Mickey Daniels ( especially when you hear his donkey laugh ! ) . It almost loses steam in the end but there's one more twist at the end that I won't reveal here . Good direction from usual Our Gang helmer Gus Meins . If you're a Hal Roach completist , by all means seek this one out !
455094	11228318	135169	7.0	Boy ! What a Girl ! should prove a fascinating find for fans of Tim " Kingfish " Moore	While Boy ! What a Girl ! is a silly race musical comedy from the late ' 40s , there's at least one noteworthy thing about it : It stars Tim Moore years before he became well known as George " Kingfish " Stevens on TV's " Amos ' n ' Andy " . This is his only film role playing a character since he had been a specialty act previously in maybe one or two movies . He's quite funny here in drag pretending to be Mme . Deborah Martin ( really Sybil Lewis ) in order to secure backing for a show whose co-backer , a Mr . Cummings ( Alan Jackson ) , falls for the pretend Deborah . Also falling for him , er , her is landlord Donaldson ( Warren Patterson ) . All three are a hoot to watch here . Mr . Jackson's daughters , Francine ( Sheila Guyse ) and Cristola ( Betti Mays ) , are in love with the would-be producers , Jim Walton ( Elwood Smith ) and Harry Diggs ( Duke Williams ) and would only be allowed to marry them if the pretend Deborah approves . The real Deborah is watching the whole thing as well as several musical acts hoping to be incognito for a while . That's all I'll mention except that both the comedy and music segments keep the movie running at a breezy hour and 9 minutes . Among the entertaining song spots : Ms . Mays performing " Crazy riffin ' " , Slam Stewart singing with his trio " Oh Me , Oh My , Oh Gosh " ( Slam's most famous composition is " Flat Foot Floogie " which was recently played in The English Patient ) , Deek Watson-who I previously watched in Abbott and Costello's Pardon My Sarong when he was one of The Ink Spots-doing " Just You Change Your Mind " and " Baby , You're the Cutest One " ( His most famous composition is " ( I Love You ) For Sentimental Reasons " ) , and drummer Sidney Catlett doing his thing before Gene Krupa-the only white cast member here-replaces him briefly . Anyone interested in a rare comedy find from the race movie era , Boy ! What a Girl ! is one worth looking for . P . S . In continuing to point out people associated with my birth state of Illinois , Mr . Moore was born in Rock Island , Mr . Catlett died in Chicago in 1951 , and Mr . Krupa was born there in 1909 .
453823	11228318	40422	7.0	Haredevil Hare was our introduction to Marvin the Martian	While Bugs is initially reluctant to go on a rocket to the moon , the carrots that are dropped inside makes him change his mind . After he lands there , a Martian ship also stops there . A funny-looking little man in a Roman soldier outfit comes out and speaks in a funny voice ( though it's different than the eventual voice we know him from ) . This guy , who we eventually know as Marvin the Martian , nonchalantly tells Bugs , after he asks what he's doing with his space modulator , that he plans to blow up the earth . It takes awhile before the rabbit stops him so Marvin then sends his dog after him . Bugs outsmarts the dog by changing one word in their exchange that makes the dog give his explosive back to Bugs . There's a chase and . . . Oh , just watch the short . Nice introduction of a space series that also incorporated Daffy Duck and Porky Pig in another Marvin the Martian cartoon called Duck Dodgers . . . Highly amusing throughout .
454000	11228318	149692	8.0	Apache Kid is one really weird pre-Code Krazy Kat cartoon	This is a really weird cartoon from Columbia Pictures ' Winkler / Mintz Studios starring Krazy Kat who , while based on George Herriman's comic strip character , is characterized much differently here . He plays the piano at a beat down nightclub while his girlfriend warbles a tune in between kissing him from the top of the piano . After doing their Apache dance , this girl gets kidnapped by a big bully of a cat . That's all I'll say except there are lots of pre-Code weird imagery like the way the villain grabs the girl by her upper body part or when one of the nightclub patrons smokes a cigarette shaped like a real camel ! I didn't find myself laughing as just marveling at how much the animators twist many animals and objects into such unusual shapes or positions that became rarer as years and decades passed on . So for that reason , I highly recommend Apache Kid .
454432	11228318	1031335	8.0	In Trust Issues , Jamie suffers a tragedy on " Bionic Woman "	In this episode , Jamie and Antonio are assigned to protect a president of a country from an assassin despite his reputation for letting politically motivated killings occur from where he resides . Antonio , however , has a personal stake in his mission and leaves details out of Jamie's ears though she eventually figures everything out . Also , while Tom seems to get along with Jamie and her sister Becca , he also has a couple of fellow agents keep tabs on her . . . This was a very exciting episode with all the suspense of recent action movies like the Bourne series whenever Jaime is running to try to prevent some catastrophe about to happen . I found the tragedy occurring at the end touching and I found myself caring about him when it happened despite me making some not-so-complimentary comments about him before ( I'm sure anyone who've read my previous " Bionic Woman " episode reviews knows who I'm talking about ) . Some of the levity of the last two episodes are missing though it was amusing when that psychiatrist put that plant in her office in order to make Jamie feel at home . And it was nice to see Becca really wanting to make her big sister feel good about herself when she prepared dinner for her and Tom . With the ratings falling and the writers strike still in effect , I don't know how much time " Bionic Woman " has this season but I'm willing to watch till the end to see how further this reboot of the late ' 70s series develops so until next time . . .
454456	11228318	38992	8.0	Studio Visit is worth a look for Lena Horne's deleted bathtub number from Cabin in the Sky	This Pete Smith Specialties short , Studio Visit , is an extra on the DVD of Cabin in the Sky . In between Louis Zingone displaying his sleight-of-hand peanut shell game and a little girl named Helen Sue Goldy displaying her balancing act with her father while eating an apple , we get a deleted scene from aforementioned movie of Lena Horne , while washing herself in a bathtub filled with bubbles covering her naked body , singing " Ain't It the Truth " . While I can guess why it was edited out , I'm now wondering why it managed to get a showing in this short three years later and also why they didn't also show Louis Armstrong performing his own version , that is now lost , in the same film . So on that note , Studio Visit is an interesting curio for Horne fans . P . S . There's also a running gag of a crew member trying to put a kerosene lamp on a hanging wire that provides the short's finish .
455253	11228318	59200	8.0	Frewayphobia # 1 was a pretty entertaining and educational Goofy cartoon	Just watched on YouTube this Walt Disney educational cartoon starring Goofy . Or at least three of them , each given a Latin name representing what kind of car driver he is : Driverius Timidicus-the timid driver , Motoramus Figitus-the fidgety driver , and Negleterus Maximus-the neglectful driver . Each one demonstrates how disastrous their driving on the freeway is by doing several " don'ts " that get them into trouble with the last character providing the most laughs from me . The original voice of Goofy himself , Pinto Colvig , is allowed to be a little more insulting here since these Goofys are nothing like the more " aw shucks " version of the character like when Motoramus tells many of his other cars stuck in accidents to " Get a horse ! " Quite entertaining while providing a lesson on driving . So on that note , I highly recommend Freewayphobia # 1 ( a . k . a . The Art of Driving on the Super Highway ) .
455137	11228318	72351	8.0	Uptown Saturday Night was an enjoyable first teaming of Poitier and Cosby	In reviewing movies in chronological order that featured African-Americans for Black History Month , we're now at 1974 with Uptown Saturday Night . This was the first of three buddy comedies that paired Sidney Poitier with Bill Cosby . This was also Poitier's third directorial assignment after Buck and the Preacher and A Warm December . Instead of the perfect professional characters superstar Sidney had been playing for years , here he's just a working class man named Steve Jackson who's pals with Cosby's Wardell Franklin . As Steve's wife Sarah , Rosalind Cash has some nice , and partially racy , dialogue with Poitier but Ketty Lester seems wasted as Wardell's spouse Irma . With a script by Richard Wesley , Poitier shows some amusing touches though it does take a while for the story , about getting robbed as the two leads spend the night at an illegal gambling joint called Zenobia's before Steve finds out his winning lottery ticket was among the stolen items , to kick into gear . When it does you get treated to a hilarious supporting cast like Flip Wilson as the Reverend , Richard Pryor as Sharp Eye Washington , Roscoe Lee Browne as Congressman Lincoln ( dig the way he turns a frame of Nixon to that of Malcoln X and then puts on his African digs when he meets his " constituents " Steve and Wardell ) , Paula Kelly as Lincoln's wife Leggy Peggy who the boys previously met at Zenobia's , and dancer Harold Nicholas as Little Seymour Pettigrew . That last character has a hilarious encounter with Cosby and Poitier himself cuts loose with some jokes you didn't think would come out of him . Also loved many of the " fights " the Cos instigates . Then there's Calvin Lockhart as Silky Slim and Harry Belafonte as Geechie Dan Beauford . These are rival gangsters that Steve and Wardell seek out to help find the stolen goods . Belafonte looks like he's having the time of his life impersonating Marlon Brando's Godfather role though I found him fitfully amusing like when he threatened to " knock the black off " Poitier and Cosby . Still , Uptown Saturday Night was a mostly enjoyable comedy that I bought on DVD with A Piece of the Action on the disc's other side . Dig Cosby's beard !
454600	11228318	150005	8.0	By Leaps and Hounds was a pretty hilarious Famous Studios cartoon	Just saw on Thad Blog linked to Daily Motion this Famous Studios cartoon ( though this version had the Harveytoons banner ) written by Irv Spector whose son now has a blog dedicated to his father . It concerns a new boy hound named Herbert who's a pupil at a fox hunt academy . His teacher gives him a horn to signal for him and the other students to hunt for a fox . But since Herbert hasn't seen one before , the actual fox at first tricks him and the others into a cave . . . That's all I'll say about the synopsis except for when they find the " fox " , he throws them out and says , " Can't a bloke hibernate in PEACE ! " LOL ! Plenty of funny gags and lines abound . Liked hearing the teacher say " Silly Arse ! " and seeing the result of the " one lump or two " question that I used to think was exclusive to Bugs Bunny cartoons . So on that note , I highly recommend By Leaps and Hounds .
455024	11228318	152496	8.0	Snow Foolin ' has some amusing gags before the song " Jingle Bells " is playing	Both previous commenters have gotten certain animals mixed up : It's a rabbit who declares the start of winter just before snow falls on him and a hen who tells us to follow the bouncing " hen egg " . Now that I cleared that up , I thought this was a highly amusing , if not hilarious , cartoon with wonderful gags that lead to the song before the last gag afterwards . Loved the ostrich doing " eight the hard way " , and the skunk saying , " Nauseating , isn't it ! " ( What's he responding to ? Watch the cartoon ! ) And then there's a kangaroo and her son falling down from the sky ( don't worry , the son is all right ! ) . When " Jingle Bells " is playing with the bouncing egg jumping on the lyrics , you also see the second and third verse which I don't think I've ever heard anyone else singing whenever I listen to Christmas songs on the radio . On that note , Snow Foolin ' is worth seeing for anyone who loves holiday cartoons .
455090	11228318	39460	8.0	Hi-De-Ho ( 1947 ) was a mostly excellent musical showcase for Cab Calloway	At first , I wasn't too thrilled about this movie because of Cab's rough treatment of Minnie ( Jeni Le Gon ) and her insolent attitude in return . And the idea of Calloway going to an audition arranged by his manager Nettie ( Ida James ) when , at this point in his life , he had already entertained millions of people in several movies , on radio , and in concerts makes this very much a plot for the birds . Good thing then that not too much time is spent on the " story " though Minnie's tragic end was a little touching with Cab granting her last wish . From then on , it's just a variety show starring Cab with his orchestra along with The Peters Sisters ( a talented group of full-figured women singers ) , and the tap-dancing Millers and Lois ( their tap routines are some of the best I've seen ) . While just every number performed by the Hi-De-Ho man is great , he's especially compelling on the " St . James Infirmary " number . And seeing the wedding number with Cab , Ida without the glasses , and Augustus Smith as the preacher makes an excellent finale for the picture . So on that note , I highly recommend Hi-De-Ho ( 1947 version since Cab previously made a couple of shorts with this name , one of which I reviewed in February ) . P . S . David Betha who plays the Brass Hat Owner here was previously in The Green Pastures ( another movie I reviewed in February ) as Aaron , Ms . Le Gon was born in my birth town of Chicago , Ill . , Mr . Smith was born in Jacksonville , Fl . , a place I lived in from 1987-2003 .
454673	11228318	320629	8.0	Timmy's Wish is one irreverent short comedy	Just watched this pretty blasphemous but also funny short on atomfilms . com . In a nutshell , Timmy , after getting sent to his room for not finishing his dinner because it has Brussel sprouts and liver , prays to Jesus that he wishes his parents were dead . Guess what happens ? The Jesus character is played by the director as someone with an attitude who swears and smokes and lets the boy partake in some vices . That is until he sees . . . Oh , just watch this short and judge for yourself if you get offended at what is depicted here . As a Catholic , I wondered why the son of God acted the way he did but then I decided this was one of those be-careful-what-you-wish-for suspense parodies that was meant to be taken with a grain of salt . So on that note , I'm cautiously recommending Timmy's Wish .
454001	11228318	64113	8.0	Bugged by a Bee was one of the funnier of the latter-day Warner Bros . cartoons	Just watched this latter-day Warner Bros . Looney Tunes cartoon on YouTube as linked from the Misce-Looney-ous blog . It stars a now-forgotten character named Cool Cat who's voiced by Larry Storch , the star of Warner Bros . Television's " F Troop " ( whose music scorer is the same here-William Lava ) . Cool Cat is a college student who wants to outscore the Big Man on Campus in athletics . With the help of a bee that keeps stinging his tail , he . . . well , watch the short . Directed by Bob McKimson ( yes , that's how he's credited here ) , that bee provides most of the laughs from me in this not-so-limited animation short as there are some movements of Cool Cat that are pretty hilarious if I do say so myself . With this being one of the last of the WB theatrical cartoons in regular production , I'd recommend Bugged by a Bee to any Warner cartoon completist out there . . .
455209	11228318	9996	8.0	Winsor McCay's The Centaurs is fascinating even in fragments	I saw three versions of this on YouTube ( as linked from Google Video ) . One of them had a heavy metal score that seemed WAY unsuitable . Beautiful images of the forest and the half human-half horse figures that still makes one take his / her breath away some 86 years later . Would be nice to see if any other fragments have survived of this most fascinating film from the father of animation , Winsor McCay . As it is , it's still interesting to watch a young centaur couple try to get the approval of the older one and then have have a young boy who says " thank you " at the end . And thank you , Mr . McCay for all your contributions to the art of animation .
454246	11228318	39088	9.0	A Christmas Dream or Vanocni sen is a wonderful holiday short from Czechoslovakia	Just watched on YouTube as linked from Matinée at the Bijou this vintage live action / puppet animation short from the Czech Republic called A Christmas Dream here in the U . S . A little girl throws away her old rag doll after getting some new presents . Santa appears to get the girl dreaming about her old doll dancing , playing the piano , sliding on it , and getting a large fan to create a strong gust wind that threatens to create havoc but the girl and the doll manages to put a stop to that . Seeing the doll and a few other toys come to life is the charm of this short especially when the live action girl reacts most enthusiastically . The directors were the brother ( I think ) team of Karel and Borivoj Zeman . They seemed to be channeling George Pal when making this . So with all that in mind , I highly recommend A Christmas Dream or as it's known in its native language , Vanocni sen .
455099	11228318	403017	9.0	Fast Food Matador is spicily musical in tone	We begin in an abstract version of New York ( with an abstract version of the destroyed World Trade Center ) . Then we start hearing Latin-flavored music with a female group singing of a man surviving traffic like a bullfighter to deliver food to customers . They also sing about a bull driving a car and trying to defeat matador . Like I said , very abstract but highly entertaining . Very worthy entry in Volume 5 of The International Tournee of Animation . At the end is a disclaimer about how bullfighting is illegal in the US and that no bull was harmed during the making of film . For fans of musical animated shorts , I definitely recommend you seek this one out !
454950	11228318	745802	9.0	The Time Element is a fascinating find for fans of " The Twilight Zone "	Since I own the book " The Twilight Zone Companion " by Marc Scott Zicree , I had a vesting interest in seeing what in essence was the de facto pilot of the show called " The Time Element " which became an episode of " Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse " . In this one , it's 1958 and Pete Jenson ( William Bendix ) is seeing a psychiatrist ( Martin Balsam ) and telling him of the same dream he's been having for about a week . It's in a hotel in Honolulu on what he later finds out is December 6 , 1941 , the day before Pearl Harbor . He tells both a newspaper publisher and a Navy ensign about his predictions but gets rebuffed both times . He wakes up just as the planes are coming . I'll stop there and just say Bendix is mostly good in his role and provides some good humor in his scenes with Jesse White as a bartender . Balsam also is compelling as the psychiatrist especially when he proposes a theory of what would happen if someone actually came back in time and died in the past . Though some of what he says may be partly contradicted by the ending with Jensen's picture at his bar , this was still a nearly excellent outing for the premise . The version I saw on YouTube had something that was missing that I read about in the book . It was Desi Arnaz ' explanation of what just happened : " We wonder if Pete Jenson did go back in time or if he ever existed . My personal answer is that the doctor had seen Jenson's picture sometime before and had a dream . Any of you out there have any other answers ? Let me know . " One critic at the time was so mad at that " explanation " he simply wrote , " GO HOME , DESI ! " After so many years , it's gratifying to finally see what Rod Serling had initially written for his proposed series that became a bona fide classic these past 50 years . Well worth seeking out .
454196	11228318	1001595	9.0	Cleveland is hilarious next-to-last season episode of 30 Rock	Jack , having just come back from his Paris honeymoon with Phoebe , suggests to Liz that she and Jenna should have lunch with her . Liz finds she and Phoebe have nothing in common while Jenna compares them to the Sex and the City gals with Liz being the " one who is watching the show " . Tracy can't get financing for his Jefferson movie and finds out Bill Cosby and the Black Crusaders are after him . Floyd , having been passed for a promotion and a new apartment , goes with Liz to his hometown , Cleveland , and gets a job offer there . He wants Liz to move with him . . . Lots of funny stuff happening in this episode like Liz ' cell playing a Wagner tune that Liz likes because Elmer Fudd sang it as Jenna warbles " Kill the wabbit ! Kill the wabbit ! " Nice comment from Lester Holt on TV telling Jordan directly , " The Black Crusaders are coming for you ! " And an affectionately funny song about how great Cleveland is is spot on during the montage of Liz and Floyd traveling the city's sights . One more episode left before the season finale . I can hardly wait !
453945	11228318	39431	9.0	Good News is one of the most underrated MGM musicals	Good News is one of the most underrated MGM musicals from the ' 40s I've ever seen from that era . While leads June Allyson and Peter Lawford are no Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney ( who ironically , were the original considered leads for this movie version years ago ) , they sing and dance entertainingly enough for one to not notice after a while . Another underrated talent showcased here is one Joan McCracken who shines in the opening number and the later made-for-film specialty " Pass That Peace Pipe " , which was eventually nominated for an Oscar for Best Original Song . And dig the " Velvet Fog " Mel Torme in his younger days crooning here ! Excellent debut for director Charles Walters and screenwriters Betty Comden and Adolph Green makes this one of the most spectacular musical comedies I've seen yet ! P . S . Among the extras on the DVD are two numbers from the 1930 film version of Good News , the title number and " The Varsity Drag " , both performed energetically and athletically by a young woman named Dorothy McNulty , later to be known as Penny Singleton from the Blondie movies . All of the above are well worth checking out !
454980	11228318	512042	9.0	The Gun is one of the funniest episodes of " Amos ' n ' Andy " so far	Wanting to make it up to Sapphire for forgetting their 20th wedding anniversary , George " Kingfish " Stevens goes to a shop with Andy to buy her a purse . They get one from a pile of them that , minutes before , had a couple of criminals-one male , one female-hide that female's purse among them . When they come home , Andy looks in the purse and finds the gun . Instead of turning it to the police , Kingfish decides to pawn the weapon . . . Don't want to reveal any more except that the gun results in some of the most hilarious scenes I've seen from this series so far . And Tim Moore's facial reactions as the Kingfish are so funny . I've got to mention here that Ernestine Wade as Sapphire and Amanda Randolph as her mom add to the fun of the troubles that Kingfish goes through with Randolph saying some choice wisecracks about her son-in-law . Recurring player Roy Glenn is fine in his straight role as the District Attorney prosecuting the Kingfish especially in contrast to George's lawyer , Algonquin J . Calhoun with his comic defense . Funniest episode of " Amos ' n ' Andy " I've seen so far .
454102	11228318	126926	9.0	Gertie on Tour is a very short but interesting sequel to Winsor McCay's Gertie the Dinosaur	There is only a minute and a half of this intriguing sequel to Gertie the Dinosaur in which the title character encounters a train and tries to eat it and dreams being surrounded by other dinosaurs . I think she also puts her tail in her mouth at the beginning . I don't know if Winsor McCay didn't finish this short or some of it is missing but even at such a short length , the footage is fascinating . This time the backgrounds are a little shaded . No doubt , anyone who loves dinosaurs and animation should take a look at this one . I found out about this one in Mark Evanier's news column and he linked a Google video of it there . Well worth seeing for any McCay and animation buffs .
455177	11228318	452716	9.0	Buffy the Vampire Slayer : Welcome to the Hellmouth is very good beginning for cult series	Sunday , September 17 , 2006 marked the last broadcast of the WB . It was marked by airing the pilots of the following classics : Felicity , Angel , Buffy the Vampire Slayer , and Dawson's Creek . Buffy the Vampire Slayer was originally a movie from 1992 starring Kristy Swanson and Luke Perry . That movie's writer , Joss Whedon , wasn't satisfied with the final result so he tried again with a TV series with himself as executive producer . Buffy Summers ( Sarah Michelle Gellar ) moves to Sunnydale from L . A . with her mother ( Kristine Sutherland ) , having been kicked out of her last high school . There she's befriended by Cordelia Chase ( Chrisma Carpenter ) who tries to introduce Buffy to her clique . But Buffy takes more of a shine to shy Willow ( Alyson Hannigan ) and her friends Xander ( Nicholas Brendan ) and Jesse ( Eric Balfour ) . As she enters the school library , she encounters a bespectacled man with a British accent named Rupert Giles ( Anthony Stewart Head ) who knows Buffy's a slayer and identifies himself as her watcher . Buffy really just wants a normal life . Giles explains what his and her duties are . Meanwhile , a dead body appears in a girl's locker . . . Very good first episode of what would be an outstanding series . Gellar , Hannigan , Brendan , and Head already make a fine team with Carpenter perfect as the stuck-up one . Also making first appearances are Angel ( David Boreanaz ) who is not yet identified as a vampire and Darla ( Julie Benz ) , not yet known as Angel's former lover . This was the first WB show that truly gave the network an identity as the one that teens could relate to . So it's fitting that it should air on the WB's last day . So long , WB . It's been nice knowing you for the past 11 years . . .
454014	11228318	37758	9.0	A Gun in His Hand is another " Crime Does Not Pay " short well worth seeking	This is another of M-G-M's " Crime Does Not Pay " shorts that appeared in the " Special Features " section of the DVD " Film Noir : Bringing Darkness to Light " . In this one , rookie cop Dennis Nordell ( Tom Trout ) , after graduating from police academy , goes back to his crooked friends in order to pull one heist after another of various warehouses . He seems to have thought it all out , but at the last minute , after he killed a veteran on the force and got transfered to homicide and then tries to finger a crook with a record , some small clues trip him up . . . Another compelling entry in the series that provides some added excitement of underscoring and narration by a mentor of some new recruits about Nordell with a lesson to them at the end . Well worth seeking out for anyone interested in these vintage stuff .
454644	11228318	146461	9.0	The Bandmaster is a very good Walter Lantz / Andy Panda cartoon	Just watched this Walter Lantz / Andy Panda cartoon on YouTube as linked from Mayerson on Animation blog . Like Mickey Mouse in The Band Concert , Mr . Panda is the conductor of a symphony orchestra though here it's in a circus . They're playing the overture to " Zampa " . While an early version of Donald Duck was the nemesis of Mickey in Band Concert , here it's just a series of unrelated gags that mostly hit the mark . Among them : An audience member attempts to give one band member a " hot " foot but a miniature fan inside the shoe puts it out , a female trapeze artist loses her hair when she goes down , and a drunk tightrope walker sees pink elephants dancing to a particularly dainty section of the piece . Andy himself is used sparingly but has some moments at the end . So on that note , The Bandmaster is recommend .
454512	11228318	1055795	9.0	The Demon Hand was another compelling episode of " Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles "	As the episode begins , Cameron is dressed as a cop . She's going to the police station to put the power out with her hand so she can get the dismembered hand from the Terminator she killed . A look at the sheet list reveals it's in the possession of Agent Ellison . After Cameron goes home and tells Sarah about the hand , Sarah tells her to look for the man who took the Turk from Andy , Dimitri . Cameron poses as a ballet dancer to find his sister , Maria . It's there she overhears her and Dimitri talking about their troubles with the Russian mob in their native language . Agent Ellison watches some tapes of Sarah when she was put in a mental institution and watched by a Dr . Silberman . He goes to where the doctor now resides : a cabin in the woods . Silberman acts kindly towards him initially then cuts his knee after poisoning him with tea to find out if he's a machine . Ellison then gets tied up and almost killed when Silberman sets fire to his own house . Sarah saves the agent after punching Silberman before taking back the hand to later burn . Ellison then turns Silberman in the same room Sarah was held in . After Cameron gets info from Dimitri about where the Turk is , she leaves him and his sister just as the mob comes up to kill them . During much of this time , John watches one of the tapes of his mother that she earlier took from Ellison's house and is saddened to find out she had years before singed away parental rights when she left him in the care of some now-dead foster parents . And Derek and Cameron each declare that they knew each other from before and Derek tells her , " You may have fooled the others but you haven't fooled me . " Though he must wonder how human-like she's becoming when he sees her ballet dancing to some familiar music . . . While this was more of a drama with expository dialogue that references T2 : Judgement Day , most of it was compellingly played . Certainly the scenes involving Silberman and Ellison were some of the most shocking I've seen so far in this series . And how wonderful to see Summer Glau put her dancing skills to good use here ! No wonder she has such a nice figure . Brian Austin Green gets better with each episode and has managed to ditch his previous role as 90210's David Silver forever ! Can't wait for the two-part season ( hopefully not series ) finale so until next time . . .
455025	11228318	740035	10.0	Melanesian Nightmare is compellingly somber episode of Victory at Sea	In New Guinea , the Japanese fight a never-ending losing battle against the Allies of Australia and the United States as more and more casualties pile up while their homeland only hears news of victory being broadcast on radio . Eventually , the soldiers ' ashes arrive in white boxes to a mournful nation . . . While depicting several battles between Americans and their Asian enemies , we see just how Japan's people are suffering in defeat as especially shown in a scene of all their bodies laying in waste . Also , a very touching scene of the massive funeral of the Pacific country's men concludes this segment providing a balance of how universal grief truly is . Great narration from Leonard Graves and , as always , touching music from Richard Rodgers . This series is highly essential viewing for World War II scholars .
454947	11228318	734666	10.0	The Night of the Meek was an excellent Christmas episode of " The Twilight Zone "	This is my fifth consecutive comment on a Rod Serling-related project and my first this month of December on a Christmas-related one . Having never seen this particular episode when " The Twilight Zone " was airing on Superstation WGN-TV in Chicago on cable during the ' 80s , I was ecstatic when I found this on joust . com as linked by Google Video . One of six episodes shot on videotape , Art Carney is Henry Corwin , a drunkard who arrives late and inebriated at his job of a department store Santa . When one parent in particular complains , the manager ( John Fielder ) fires him on the spot but not until Henry expresses his wish to help less fortunate folks , as opposed to the arrogant and spoiled ones in the store , does he leave . Outside as he stumbles into his alley , a cat drops a big bag down in front of him . When he comes to the church of salvation , all the poor souls there miraculously get whatever presents they wanted from that bag ( one of those souls is played by Burt Mustin , who I remembered from a couple episodes of " All in the Family " ) . The organ playing woman there does not approve and gets a cop who takes him in . At the station , Henry's former manager tries to take back what he thinks are his store's stolen goods but sees nothing but tin cans and thinks the cop wasted his time bringing him there . But when Corwin reaches back in the bag , he presents his ex-boss with a bottle of a certain vintage wine that he wished for . I'll stop there and mention how wonderful to discover another great Art Carney performance after years of seeing him as Norton in " The Honeymooners " as well as his Oscar-winning turn in Harry and Tonto . He brings such belief and optimism to his role that when the whimsical turn of events come at the end , you can't help but be happy for him . Not a typical " Twilight Zone " episode , that's for sure , but one worth seeing for anyone who loves the Christmas spirit .
455033	11228318	740034	10.0	Mediterranean Mosiac is another compelling episode of Victory at Sea	British forces head on to Gibraltar and Malta to hold off the Italian Navy and the German Luftwaffe from invading there . While the English do get constantly bombarded at the Malta Islands , they remain steadfastly determined to keep charging especially after King George VI pays a visit there . . . The most interesting part of this episode is the amount of mealtimes the British sailors have in a day : 5 ( cocoa , breakfast , dinner , tea , and supper ) ! There's also scenes of relaxation on board ship before the , we later find out , 17 months of battle that occurs on the Malta shores . Once again , great narration and wonderfully stirring music as written by the legendary Richard Rodgers . Victory at Sea is essential viewing for the World War II scholar interested in seeing history come alive on television !
454365	11228318	36968	10.0	Jammin ' the Blues is most innovative of its time	Jammin ' the Blues is an Oscar-nominated short from 1944 that is basically 10 minutes of improvisational jazz played in one long jam . Marie Bryant sings " The Sunny Side of the Street " at one point for the film's highlight then jitterbugs with Archie Savage to bring this most entertaining " jam session " to its exciting end . The director Gojn Mili was a photographer and that experience shows in some of the double exposure shots of some of the musicians that makes this one of the most innovative angles of the ' 40s . According to some notes I read one of the musicians was white and had to be filmed in silhouette in reflection of the social attitudes of the time . What a shame . Still , this most unusual film of the time is available on YouTube so if you love jazz , I suggest you seek it out there .
454404	11228318	405159	10.0	Million Dollar Baby was certainly one of the best pictures of 2004	I've now seen this movie twice . The first time was in the theatre after it won the Oscars for Best Picture , Best Director ( Clint Eastwood ) , Best Actress ( Hilary Swank ) , and Best Supporting Actor ( Morgan Freeman ) . The last was hours ago on HD DVD with my parents . My dad thought it dragged a little while my mom thought it was about more than boxing and liked the slow passages . In between the drama with the three stars , there's some humor involving Clint and Morgan as well as with Morgan and some of the other boxing hopefuls including a really enthusiastic kid who initially calls Freeman the " N " word but says he doesn't really mean it . Morgan's character also narrates the story in what is revealed to be a letter to Eastwood's long-estranged daughter who we never see . The movie does take its own sweet time and makes Paul Haggis ' dialogue shine throughout . Since I've only seen one of the other Best Picture Oscar nominees of 2004 ( The Aviator ) , I can't judge if this was indeed the finest of that year . However , Million Dollar Baby was certainly one of the most compelling .
454367	11228318	45626	10.0	Christopher Crumpet is wonderfully animated UPA short	Just saw this classic UPA short on YouTube . It concerns a little boy who turns into a chicken when he doesn't get what he wants from his parents . In this one , he wants a rocket ship . His father gets a toy one . " I want a REAL one ! " , Christopher exclaims . The father sees an ad for a real one in the paper . He gets it but it turns out ( as evident when the boy comes outside and sees it fall apart ) to be used . " I wand a NEW one ! " , comes the reply . Christopher keeps turning into a chicken every time he gets disappointed . During all this , the dad's officemate tries to win a bet with his boss about this unbelievable event . While the boss does see the boy and the chicken , he never sees the transformation so the officemate loses his pay for a year . All this is narrated by an illustrator to a dog that results in a surprise ending that I won't ruin here . Well worth seeing cartoon directed by Robert Cannon with Bill Melendez as one of the animators . Many other UPA classics like Gerald McBoing Boing and The Tell Tale Heart are also available for viewing on YouTube so to anyone with a love of all things animated , I highly recommend you seek them out there .
455019	11228318	223400	10.0	The Great Toy Robbery is a fine Canadian animated holiday short	Just discovered this quite funny animated short from Warren Leonhardt on his blog as linked from The National Film Board of Canada site . It takes place in the Old West with a cowboy , some robbers , and Santa Claus . Oh , and some toys . It takes a while but the way the gags are timed , you just can't help double up with laughter at how sudden some movements are and the way the whole thing is executed . Kudos go to director / co-animator Jeffrey Hale , Derek Lamb who did the storyboard and design , Don Douglas for the cool music , and Richard Gilbert for the voices . Oh , and I loved the way that horse doesn't always listen to the cowboy's commands ! So on that note , I highly recommend The Great Toy Robbery .
454212	11228318	1017495	10.0	Pie-lette marks a great start for unique series " Pushing Daises "	" Pushing Daises " is the most critically acclaimed new show of the season and I can't help but agree how great the pilot or " Pie-lette " is ! Lee Pace is charming in a role that requires him to not show too much personality as Ned . Chi McBride shows a flair for comedy as Detective Emerson Cod , Ned's partner on cases and his pie restaurant . Kristen Chenoweth as Olive Snook , Ned's waitress , brings her pixie spriteness to the table , and Anna Friel brings a spunky optimism to her role as Charlotte " Chuck " Charles , a childhood crush Ned brings back to life he dares not touch again if he wants her to keep living . Also want to mention Swoosie Kurtz and Ellen Greene as Chuck's aunts that she lived with after Ned , when they were young children , inadvertently killed her father ( which she doesn't know about ) . What wonderful veterans they are ! This show is worthy of all the acclaim it got and the ratings it got means that a lot of people were willing to try this one out . Can't wait to see what the rest of the season brings !
455189	11228318	141075	10.0	This parody of Romeo and Juliet is Felix at most creative	Felix the Cat as Romeow is funny from beginning to end ! The best one I've seen so far . It begins as Felix is riding his bike to a fair maiden's castle . When he arrives , the smoke from his bike carries him to the fair maiden's balcony . While Felix woos with his banjo , his rival is on his way on his horse . As he arrives , he challenges Felix to a duel but not before he squeezes his horse like an accordion ! They use swords . Felix manages to cast his rival's sword out so the rival uses an ostrich's beak instead ! After that ends , Felix wanders out and comes to a flower , blows its petals out and turns it into a microphone ! He sings to it which comes out of the fair maiden's phonograph . A duck comes behind Felix and quacks into the mic causing the fair maiden to use some kind of medicine to feed her speaker and Felix to tie the duck's beak with a handkerchief ! The duck goes to his father who unties the handkerchief which then becomes a rabbit that hops away ! The duck's father than tries to confront Felix who keeps kicking him away . The father duck then uses the mic to preen as if looking in a mirror ! Then a donkey comes and licks the mic before dropping it . Then a mouse comes and turns the mic into a unicycle ! Felix then goes back to the castle and uses the tire from his bike as some kind of viewfinder to eye his maiden . He climbs back up to find the maiden and his rival in embrace . He then finds two megaphone shaped things and uses one of them to shrink his rival to mouse size ! Felix then embraces the maiden as we iris out . I'm sure there are some gags I've neglected to mention but trust me : This short is quite hilarious ! It's also nearly perfectly synchronized with sound effects and music which I'm thinking came from a reissue since it came from a year that The Jazz Singer was just premiering . By all means , seek this one out !
455176	11228318	533501	10.0	Buffy the Vampire Slayer : The Harvest is excellent conclusion to series pilot	This is the second part of the pilot episode that aired on the WB's last broadcast of September 17 , 2006 . In this one , The Master and his minions are trying to " harvest " lives in order to free The Master from the underground Hellmouth . We find out Jesse is now a vampire , Willow is good with computers , Cordelia's not ( I love Willow's " Push the deliver key " line to her ) , Harmony ( Mercedes McNab ) is Cordelia's friend here , and minion Luke ( Brian Thompson ) is not too bright ( another favorite line , " It's about nine hours , moron " from Buffy after tricking Luke to look through a broken glass window with the sun shining ) . The final line from Giles , " The earth is doomed " after Willow , Xander , and Buffy joke about possible ways Buffy could get kicked out of school makes this the perfect beginning of this wonderful comedy-horror hybrid for the next seven years . . .
454426	11228318	1122417	10.0	Smell of Success is another hilarious episode of " Pushing Daises "	This is the funniest episode of " Pushing Daises " yet ! I'll just mention what this show has : murder by scratch-n-sniff , rival authors , rival colleagues , Paul Reubens , " Follow the yellow hose " , Olive in a mermaid outfit , Olive's cleavage , and Chuck's aunt Vivian singing , " Morning Has Broken " . There's plenty more I haven't mentioned but one more thing I have to say is : Thanks , ABC , for giving this whimsically funny series a full-season pickup ! Also glad to know the ratings have gone up . Every week this show just keeps getting better . Now if only the writers ' strike ends soon ( with the writers getting what they want ) so we can get that full season in bloom ASAP !
455197	11228318	11223	10.0	Get Out and Get Under is an excellent Harold Lloyd short from Hal Roach	Get Out and Get Under is Harold Lloyd's first film after an exploding accident that caused him to lose a two fingers and a thumb in one of his hands requiring him to wear a prosthetic glove in movies for the rest of his career . This is a very funny short in which Harold is hurrying to get to the theatre for his performance . Lots of hilarious scenes concerning ways to fix his car , his dealings with a kid ( Ernie " Sunshine Sammy " Morrison of the original Our Gang ) who keeps hanging around while he's working , a dog , some engineers of a train ferry the car accidentally goes on , a parade , a banana peel ( no surprise there ) , a steep hill , a water tower , a fire hydrant , a " road closed " sign , and some motorcycle cops . His leading lady is played by his eventual wife , Mildred Davis . Produced and directed by comedy mastermind Hal Roach . The music I heard in this version was provided by Vince Giordano and his Nighthawks Orchestra . Highly essential viewing for silent movie comedy fans especially those of Harold Lloyd .
454865	11228318	178016	10.0	Der Schneemann is a wonderful vintage animated short from Germany	Just watched on YouTube as linked from Saturday Morning Blog this German cartoon known in the U . S . as The Snowman or Snowman in July . Whitey Snowman comes to life one winter day and enjoys running in the snow and ice skating . When he falls in the ice river , he comes back much thinner but gains all his weight by rolling in the snow . He also loses his head at one point but gets it back quickly . Then at home , he looks at a calendar and wishes it was July . So he hibernates in a fridge ( guess the idea of suffocating in there doesn't pertain to snowmen ) and waits for the coming spring . . . This was a very touching and amusing cartoon that I had read about but didn't get to see until now . I liked seeing that dog snatch Whitey's butt in the beginning before he threw back a snow that reattached said butt and when that bug in the spring segment skied on the snowman . The version I saw had an English-speaking narrator that made the short quite entertaining from beginning to end . So on that note , I highly recommend Der Schneemann which was directed by one Hans Fischerkoesen . P . S . There seemed to be some of that 3-D like tabletop background one usually associates with Max Fleischer . Additional P . S . - I just watched the original German version that had different music and had the snowman singing in that language at the end . Still excellent .
455076	11228318	1025163	10.0	The House That Ahmet Built is one of the most essential docs of music history	This American Masters episode showcases the wonderful influence of Ahmet Ertegun , the founder of Atlantic Records . Since the label's founding in 1947 , some of the most popular Rhythm and Blues and Rock ' n ' Roll artists have worked for Atlantic . Among them : first artist Ruth Brown , Big Joe Turner , Ray Charles , Bobby Darin , The Coasters , Aretha Franklin , The Rolling Stones , Phil Collins and many more . Also covered are many of the Atlantic crew like engineer Tom Dowd , producer Jerry Wexler , and songwriters Mike Lieber and Jerry Stoller . Mostly , this two hour documentary covers Ahmet's life from his childhood in Turkey to his moving to the United States as a teenager when he experienced some of the most happening sounds of Harlem to his discoveries of some of the greatest musicians the world has ever known . Atlantic artist Bette Midler narrates this loving look at her boss that manages to capture Ertegun's essence just before he died after falling backstage at a Rolling Stones concert last December . Well worth seeking out for anyone interested in the history of Rock ' n ' Roll .
455021	11228318	565840	10.0	The Big Little Jesus is a touching Christmas episode of " Dragnet "	Having just seen the more tragic " Dragnet " holiday episode - " The Big . 22 Rifle for Christmas " - I'd thought I'd check the more positive-influenced one called " The Big Little Jesus " . In this one taking place on Christmes Eve-which is the same day of when this was broadcast in 1953-Friday and his partner Frank Smith ( this time played by Ben Alexander ) have promised Father Rojas ( Harry Bartell who was born in New Orleans in my home state of Louisiana ) to recover the stolen baby Jesus statue for the church nativity by the Christmas Day mass the next morning . I'll stop there and just say that this was a more lighter episode concerning the holidays as evidenced by Friday and Smith's banter about presents in the beginning scenes and that the ending was one of the most touching in the series history . Also appearing are Walter Sande , who died in my birthtown of Chicago , Illinois , as Captain Bernard and child actor Billy Chapin as Joseph Hefferman . His sister , Lauren , would later become one of the stars of the hit show " Father Knows Best " . Now I'm going to watch the remake for " Dragnet 1967 " . . .
453862	11228318	41310	10.0	Dough for the Do-Do is basically Porky in Wackyland filmed in color this time	Dough for the Do-Do is basically a color version of Bob Clampett's original black-and-white Porky in Wackyland with some changes done by Friz Freling . I actually haven't seen the first film version in its entirety yet so I wrote the previous sentence based on other comments I've read here . It certainly has many of the touches one usually associates with Clampett like the " rubber band " sequence ( with Mel Blanc's hilarious " music notes " that he would also use for Marvin Martian's trumpet ) . There's also a guy saying , " Let me out ! " constantly while holding just a jail cell window and a duck who looks like Daffy frequently saying , " Mammy ! " Porky is perfectly perplexed throughout the whole short as he tries to get the " last of the Do-Dos " . Loved the bird's constant " Do-do " sounds . Well worth seeing .
454596	11228318	236769	10.0	Ryan Larkin's Street Musique is a wonderful collage of animated images	Just watched this on the National Film Board of Canada site where they have about 300 of their material presented for your enjoyment . Having previously viewed and commented on a couple of shorts associated with animator Ryan Larkin , I was excited when Street Musique was presented on the NFB site twice in both French and English title form ( otherwise , it's the same film ) . Starting with black-and-white live-action of a fiddle player and a mandolin player performing on a downtown sidewalk , Larkin then does abstract line drawings on white that become images that are very hard to describe . He then does some watercolor ( at least that's what I think it is ) images that are likewise . All this is done to the music of those two players that matches the drawings perfectly . Nothing else to say except for anyone who loves abstract animation , I highly recommend Ryan Larkin's Street Musique .
454942	11228318	392925	10.0	Yes , Virginia , There Is a Santa Claus is another charming animated holiday special from Bill Melendez	" He will continue to make glad , the heart of childhood . " So answered New York Sun editor Francis Church at the end of his editorial to one Virginia O'Hanlon one day in 1897 to her question of is there a Santa Claus . Taking a break from the " Peanuts " specials , director Bill Melendez put the same charm he visualized in those on this one to sentimental effect with once again children voicing the kid characters . I loved the scene between that street cop Virginia asked about the red-suited man and that cop's superior on the phone and his reply to Virginia about what that superior said about Santa . And how nice was it to hear Jim Backus as the narrator here . Since I don't want to spoil anything , you'll have to watch this to find out who he's supposed to be in relation to the story . So , yes , that's a recommendation . . .
454206	11228318	1001584	10.0	Jack Gets in the Game is another hilarious episode of " 30 Rock "	Jack invites Liz to his office to eat his $52 steak in front of him since his surgery has made him health conscious .

So the plan worked . Guiess tells Jack he knows about his health and tells him he's on the list and that he wants to eventually know his " secret family in Canada . " Liz moves on after using her wedding dress that she borrowed prop up a table that has two short legs on one side . . . Hope the synopsis I gave you was enough to tell you how hilarious this episode was . Everything was in fine form here and the guest turns by Rip Torn , Sherri Shepherd , Chris Parnell , and , especially , Will Arnett are welcome with the return of their recurring characters . Wish the ratings hadn't gone a little down after last weeks . Hopefully , NBC wasn't too worried about that . . .
453789	11228318	60503	10.0	John and Faith Hubley's Herb Albert and the Tijuana Brass Double Feature was a pretty humorously entertaining Oscar-winning animated short	Just watched this Oscar-winning John and Faith Hubley-written and produced animated short distributed by Paramount on YouTube as linked from Cartoon Brew . The title's meaning is that two Herb Albert selections - " Spanish Flea " and " Tijuana Taxi " - are illustrated in animated form in their entirety . " Spanish Flea " has the title character annoying a donkey , chicken , a gangster and his girlfriend and other people at a hotel party . " Tijuana Taxi " has the driver trying to get his passengers to the plane on time . Both segments have compellingly humorous abstract line drawings set to the beat of the wonderful music . Don't want to say anymore except I highly recommend Herb Albert and the Tijuana Brass Double Feature .
454864	11228318	1136041	10.0	The Dumpling Paradox is the first excellent episode of " The Big Bang Theory "	As Leonard , Sheldon , Howard Wolowitz , and Raj Koothrappali play the TV video game Halo , Penny barges in and asks if she could stay for awhile as her cousin from Nebraska , Christi ( Brooke D'Orsay ) , makes herself at home in her apartment there . Turns out she can't stand her as Christi has a slutty reputation , especially with members of Penny's immediate family ! Hearing this , Howard goes to Penny's apartment and charms the socks off Christi so much they spend the night there . So Penny not only defeats Sheldon on Halo , she begs to stay overnight at his and Leonard's place to Sheldon's consternation ! Next day , Christi agrees to live with Howard who lives with his mother ! This upsets Sheldon's sense of equality later at a Chinese restaurant since instead of splitting for four , they have to split for three . When the following week , Penny gets asked to be a fourth partner on Halo again , she declines having already dressed up for dancing . So they all go to Howard's house where they overhear arguments between his mom and Christi . Not wanting to stay for that , Howard goes back for another round of the game . . . This is the funniest episode yet of " The Big Band Theory " . I must also mention how nice to see James Hong again as the restaurant owner here after seeing him as the wheelchair crime boss on " Chuck " a few weeks earlier . As always , most of the best lines came from Sheldon though Simon Helberg also has his share . So glad this is doing so well on Monday night on CBS ! Now let's hope the writer's strike ends soon so we'll see new episodes through the end of the season and not just til January . . .
454041	11228318	923975	10.0	Vau-Vau is one of a few animated shorts I've seen from Zagreb Films	Just discovered on Cartoon Brew linked to YouTube this unique animated short from a company called Zagreb Films . In Vau-Vau , a dog in the forest scares many small creatures like a bird , a snail , and a ball . Then he encounters a cat who tries to scare the dog back . Then they both go at it with smaller versions of themselves . . . Wholly done by one artist , Boris Kolar , Vau-Vau seems to have been decorated by a magic marker with black representing the dog and purple the cat . Wonderful orchestral music throughout especially when the flute is showcased . Anyone interested in unique animation forms from other countries should give this and others from Zagreb Films a chance . I'm now going to watch a couple more from Cartoon Brew . . .
454582	11228318	902012	10.0	Fallout is excellent end-of-the-year episode of Heroes	Peter is in the interrogation room questioned by FBI agent Audrey and mind-reading cop Matt . When Matt tries to read Peter's head , Peter ends up reading Matt's ending with a colliding block effect . Peter mentions that Claire , not the dead Jackie , was who Syler was after so Matt and Audrey leave to get her as Peter is left behind . Jessica hit Niki's ex-husband D . L . but the bullets went through him though Jess doesn't seem to know this yet ( she must have memory loss from when D . L put his hand through her previously ) . The next morning , D . L . and son Macah go to a cabin to settle down just before Niki comes nearby and sees her Jessica reflection on a puddle with Jessica saying how stronger she is for anyone , especially Niki , to take her on . Jess must have figured out by this time that D . L . was still alive and takes her gun and hides it as Micah finds her , thinking it's his mom , and takes her back to the cabin . As Micah calls to his dad , D . L . kicks the door open and attempts to knock out Jessica . Sometime after kicking down Micah , Niki comes back and turns herself in the the police . Back to the interrogation room , Claire is questioned with her father witnessing stopping short of revealing her powers since her dad doesn't want anyone else to know . Claire later stops by Peter's cell to tell him what a hero he is to her while her dad confronts Syler and calls him by his real name of Gabriel Gray . He later gets orders from above to keep Syler alive though Eden , with her powers of persuasion , mentions being able to make Syler kill himself without anyone being the wiser . Eden then visits Issac and gives him a cell phone and a card . Issac calls the number on the card and gets Hiro , still at the diner in Texas . They agree to meet at a bus station . At a nearby hotel room , Issac tries to paint without drugs for the first time as Hiro and Ando watch . The result is a scene of Hiro with a sword confronting a dinosaur . Hiro looks at that and says , " I gotta get me a sword . " Eden calls Mohinder in New York and confesses she lied to him , promising to tell him everything after she takes care of some business . She goes to Syler's cell and attempts to kill him , but he manages to break the glass between them and somehow quickly point the gun back at her instantly killing her . Before going home , Claire is assured by her dad that he'll take care to explain to her little brother about knowing her powers and is ordered to have the tapes Zack recorded of her to be destroyed . She does just that when Zack brings them , then goes to her brother who has no memory of the incident . Neither does Zack later on and he's now wondering why Claire is speaking to him since she's ignored him since sixth grade . Claire , now feeling alone , calls her dad who reassures her everything's all right . Just then his Haitian assistant , who was always silent previously , surprises Claire and reveals he's wiped certain memories of everyone she's been close to and was going to do the same to her but reneges this time . He only asks her , " Can you keep a secret ? " During this whole time , Peter has been having dreams or visions of his brother Nathan , Syler , and now of being back in New York with all the other heroes except his brother running away from him as he begins to explode . . . But wait , now he's back in present time feeling normal with Nathan embracing him and some of the others coming back . . . Wow , what a way to end the year before the month-long hiatus ! So Eden's now dead . Although I mentioned that Syler pointed the gun back at her , I now wonder did Eden purposely turn the gun around to keep him from getting her persuasion powers or did Syler manage to get some of Eden's powers before or after killing her ? When Matt shook hands with Claire's dad , he didn't recognize him but on a later stakeout he did recognize his Haitian assistant with him . So how long before he figures out that his mind's been wiped by the Haitian man ? And was Peter actually about to cause the bomb explosion or did he get close to that man who actually makes things burn sometime before ? I can't wait to find out all these things and more come January 22 , 2007 !
454100	11228318	853635	10.0	Heroes : Collision moves the series along briskly	One thing I forgot to mention from the last episode , Niki the stripper took her son Micah to his grandmother's house where the grandma believes her son , Niki's ex-husband , is innocent of the charges he is in jail for . In the beginning of this episode , we find Matt the cop , after passing out in the bar after witnessing a black man as the only one he couldn't read the mind of , strapped to a machine with that black man and Claire's dad watching over him .

Back at school , she encounters another girl who confides in her that the quarterback had done to her what Claire had just experienced as that quarterback appears before Claire's eyes and blatantly flirts with another girl .

Niki is at the Vagas hotel doing her job when she encounters Nathan who is on a trip . As they get to a room , Nathan mentions he's married with two sons which seems to make Niki resists his advances . After she leaves , Niki encounters someone who wants some payment his now-dead cohorts didn't get . It is in the elevator that Niki switches to a more aggressive personality and threatens this someone with her heel . She tells this someone to " leave our child alone " . She then comes back to Nathan's room and is recorded on camera as she makes love to him . Peter convinces Mohinder to come to painter Issac's apartment to see Peter siphon Issac's ability to paint the future but the artist is too into his work to even answer the doorbell . As they get back on the train , Mohinder again displays his skepticism as everything stops except Peter , then a Japanesse man from the future greets Peter and says , " I am from the future , it's nice to see you without your scar . " It is Hiro , speaking perfect English , with a katana and long hair and no glasses ! Okay , so this has just got more interesting ! I liked all the developments though like many others I did wonder why Mohinder suddenly seemed to do a 360 degree turn in his personality . Hope to see more of Greg Grunberg as Matt next week and that he still has some of his mind-reading abilities intact . Oh , and to Claire : You go , girl !

453835	11228318	1245104	10.0	Presto is another excellent Pixar animated short	This is the second of five Oscar-nominated animated shorts I've watched from last year . It's from Pixar and was originally presented before their feature WALL-E which I have yet to see . A magician's bunny just wants a carrot but his master keeps taking it away from him so during the performance with the master on stage with his own hat and the bunny at the side hidden by curtains holding the sorcerer's hat that serves as the connection between where the magician's hand goes , the bunny does all kinds of tricks of his own on his master while the audience thinks it's all part of the act . . . Reminiscent of the wacky stuff done by Tex Avery , Bob Clampett , and Frank Tashlin in the ' 40s , Presto provides non-stop slapstick that gets more outrageously funny with each gag before the crescendo that satisfyingly comes . And dig the beginning logo credits done in the way they might have been if this short really was made during that Golden Age of animation . In short , Presto is magnifico !
455061	11228318	51634	10.0	Free Radicals is another amazing Len Lye short	Along with A Colour Box and The Peanut Vendor , Free Radicals is another highly exciting experimental animated short by Len Lye . Seeing chalk white lines constantly moving on a black background with African drums playing throughout makes for one of the most unique experiences I've ever seen in animation history . How is it I've never even heard of this guy until today when I looked up Cartoon Brew and there was an item about The Peanut Vendor ( an early experimental stop-motion from the early thirties ) that depicted a monkey and various uses of his tail . The item took me to YouTube which also had Free Radicals and A Colour Box and I was blown away by all three shorts ! To anyone with a taste of the unusual , I suggest you seek all them out !
454730	11228318	38060	10.0	The Screwy Truant is hilarious Tex Avery cartoon from MGM	When I was a kid watching the Tom and Jerry show on weekday afternoons in the late ' 70s and early ' 80s , I watched most of the cartoons they aired that was from the ' 40s including those starring Droopy or Barney Bear . For some reason , however , they never either showed or I never saw any Screwy Squirrel cartoons made during the same time . So The Screwy Truant is the very first one starring this admittedly unappealing , both visually and personality-wise , character I've ever seen . Despite that , I loved the " everything but the kitchen sink " ( actually , don't think too much about that one ) humor of the entire premise of the title character playing hooky and getting chased by the truant officer with all the fast-paced wackiness you can only expect from the one and only Tex Avery . Absolutely nothing is sacred , certainly not " Little Red Riding Hood " or jokes related to WWII air raid uniforms . So to anyone who loves great animation and great laughs , The Screwy Truant is for you !
