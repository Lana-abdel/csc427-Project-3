454721	11228318	352157	2.0	All Amateur Ecstasy was a pretty lame short I found on atom . com	Just watched this very brief short on atom . com . Three women in separate rooms all seem to be reaching orgasm . There are constant cuts between all three of them . In addition , a man is watching one of them ( the woman is at work so the man is supposedly her boss ) . And then . . . they all sneeze ! The end . I suppose if I didn't halfway think of wanting to see something erotic , I probably would of thought this was really funny and maybe when I think of this later I will . But being up real late , I was just not really thinking this was even remotely funny . I guess I'll give this one a 2 . Sorry , it's just how I feel right now . It was cleverly filmed , however . . .
455045	11228318	32716	2.0	Little Lambkin was a way below average Max Fleischer Color Classic cartoon	Just watched this rare Max Fleischer Color Classic on YouTube . The title character is a toddler boy who-when his parents are temporarily away-loves to play with animal friends , a raccoon and a squirrel . Together they eat a whole watermelon . But this day , the boy has to move to the city where he has to deal with electrical appliances . In order to move back to his previous home , this toddler proceeds to switch many electrical plugs that makes a refrigerator into a stove , etc . . . I've just described most of the cartoon and I'm not very impressed with the results . The watermelon sequences in the beginning and end were amusing but the chaos with the switched plugs in the city kitchen was too ridiculous even for an animated cartoon . And the boy himself was too bratty for my tastes when he constantly cried about not wanting to move . So unless you're a Max Fleischer completist , I wouldn't recommend Little Lambkin .
454313	11228318	80014	2.0	There Goes the Bride and my $1 . 00 purchase . . .	There Goes the Bride is a very witless fantasy-comedy that is even more disappointing when you consider the cast : Tom Smothers , Twiggy , Martin Balsam , Broderick Crawford , Hermione Baddeley , Jim Backus , Phil Silvers , and Graham Stark . All have had better roles in better pictures or TV shows . None can save the very lame material here . I do have to admit to some charm concerning some dance moves by Smothers and Twiggy when they reenact Astaire and Rogers in their prime . Those scenes make the picture somewhat tolerable . There was even some amusement at the way it all ended . Otherwise , this movie is not even worth the $1 . 00 I paid for this DVD which was double billed with the mediocre It Seemed Like a Good Idea at the Time which featured a young John Candy . Avoid at all costs unless you're really curious .
455186	11228318	20248	2.0	Felix disappoints with Outdoor Indore	Outdoor Indore is yet another disappointment from Felix's late era at the Pat Sullivan Studio . Felix tries to join the circus . He goes to the fire department and gets a hose , attach√©s it to the fire hydrant , and presents it to the ringmaster ( Why , I don't know ! ) . An angry fireman turns on the apparently stolen hose which douses Felix and sends him to India . He encounters a boy sucking on a huge peppermint stick . When Felix encounters him , the stick is now standing on the ground . The boy leaves and Felix grabs the stick which turns into a tiger's tail . The tiger chases Felix who turns into a cactus that the tiger passes . As the tiger stops , the cactus behind him turns back to Felix and takes the tiger's stripes which become a ladder ! Felix climbs the ladder and with his glasses spots from afar a man playing a cornet which causes a snake to appear from his basket . Felix detaches his tail and plays it like a flute causing a snake each to appear in the two holes Felix is between . Felix jumps to a tree branch so that the snakes jump out of their holes to form a unicycle . On the unicycle , he sees a man driving a wagon with an exhausted elephant leading . Felix goes to the elephant to offer him a job at the circus where he will get adulation . The elephant accepts and he and Felix boards the next boat available . As the ship leaves , it leans heavily on the side the elephant and Felix are on making the captain on the other side furious . Felix tells the elephant to drink the water so he does . With all the seawater gone , they walk to the customs officer who is greeted by the elephant's seawater from his trunk ! Felix and the elephant walk to the ringmaster who offers them a job . They are a hit with the audience as the film iris out . This might have been an attempt to make Felix more of a heartwarming character but it doesn't really work here . And the gags seem to have a " been there , done that " kind of feel , so lacking is the timing . Perhaps the sound era and Pat Sullivan's ailments are contributing factors to these disappointing last shorts . Certainly the competition from Disney and Fleischer couldn't have helped . After a few years , Felix would be gone but would be briefly revived by Van Buren and then fully revived by the late ' 50s on television for a new audience .
454273	11228318	25188	2.0	Going ' to Heaven on a Mule is worse than nearly all the Warner " Censored 11 " cartoons	Just discovered on the Misce-Looney-ous site linked to YouTube this rare Warner Bros . cartoon short directed by Friz Freling that's NOT on the " Censored 11 " list . Based on the final number in the Al Jolson picture Wonder Bar , this cartoon is awash in offensive stereotypes of African-Americans like having one take to drink constantly and another one automatically eat a watermelon and a few more automatically playing dice in Heaven which here is called Pair-O'-Dice ( Paradise , get it ? ) . And their faces all resembles monkeys , aaarrrggggg ! The only thing that's remotely entertaining here is the title number which doesn't surprise me since Freling often made good musical cartoons . So for that alone , this cartoon gets two stars , otherwise I'd only recommend this for Warner animation completists .
454829	11228318	233371	3.0	The version I saw of Boys Will Be Joys was abridged to one reel	This Hal Roach comedy short , Boys Will Be Joys , is the forty-second in the " Our Gang / Little Rascals " series . The version I saw was on Goodtimes ' VHS of " Our Gang Comedy Festival II " . It was a shortened one-reel version of an originally two-reel film . And since this version was handled by a company other than the original Hal Roach Studios or their distributor Pathe Exchange , the series title was " Those Lovable Scallawags with Their Gangs " with the episode title being " Carnival Time " . With the original H . M . Walker inter-titles removed , here's the synopsis , in my own words , I partly got from the definitive book on the " Our Gang / Little Rascals " series by Leonard Maltin and Richard W . Bann : While the gang has plans for a new amusement park in an acre of their choosing , the surveyor tells them it's being used for a future factory . Undeterred , they see the sixty-year-old president of the land-owning company who has the heart of a ten-year-old . After hearing the gang's story , he decides to make their dream come true and walks out on his own meeting ! The board of directors follow him hoping to get the chairman to agree to get him voted off . In the end , with the kids and some of the men helping in operating the makeshift rides , the president tells the board he's retiring and vows to think as young as the gang are . . . Not very amusing and the rides seem not to convincing as simply the creation of the kids-even with the financier's fun-loving aid . There is an interesting angle of a fluidly moving shot of a boy going backwards on a slide in a wheel-less vehicle that was partly fascinating . I was also amused by Farina's displaying of a " Wild Animal " in his tent-which turns out to be a skunk . Otherwise , Boys Will Be Joys was just an average " Our Gang " short .
455152	11228318	146518	3.0	Krazy Kat , Bugologist is an interesting curio of the silent animation era	I agree with the previous reviewer that nothing really happens in this cartoon ( Krazy and Ignaz finds bee , thinks its dead , bee comes alive . Then elephant comes and is scared by Ignaz . The end . ) though its animation is pretty interesting for the era it occurred . The animator's name is Frank Moser who later was in partnership with Paul Terry when he formed Terrytoons in the ' 30s . Since 10 lines is required for me to finish this comment , I'll also say that before Felix the Cat , many animation stars originally came from comic strips like Krazy Cat and Ignaz , The Katzenjamer Kids , or Mutt and Jeff . It wasn't until King Features ' Popeye was adapted for animation by the Max Fleischer studio in the ' 30s , however , that a successful transition was made from newspaper page to the silver screen . But that probably wouldn't have happened without his predecessors I've just mentioned .
454492	11228318	26257	5.0	Dancing on the Moon was an interesting Max Fleischer Color Classic	Just watched this Max Fleischer Color Classics cartoon on the Classic Cartoons blog . Like many of Fleischer's Technicolor cartoons of this era , this one has backgrounds of models done on a tabletop that achieves that 3-D effect of an animated character appearing in live-action . Here , those backgrounds are of moon craters . Various newlywed animal couples are singing the title song as well as , well , dancing on the moon ( obviously , this was way before the historic moon landing of 1969 since everyone here is breathing healthy in space ) . Actually , a feline groom is missing his bride since she narrowly missed her ride . That's all I'll say except that while the musical number is pretty entertaining and there are some amusing gags , the final punchline isn't funny and in fact may be a bit too cruel for the young ' uns . If you're a Fleischer completist , however , I do recommend Dancing on the Moon for one look .
454734	11228318	146968	5.0	Krazy Kat Goes A-Wooing has a kind of primitive charm	Since the previous reviewer summed up what happens in this 2-minute cartoon , I'll just mention that Krazy also has some kind of flying contraption which he uses to fly to where he mistakenly thinks is Ignatz ' house and he takes a guitar where you see visual notes whenever he plays some music . And in many of the word balloons , many of the words end with " ink " like " darlink " . Since Zsa Zsa Gabor speaks like that , I half wonder if she learned English after moving from Hungary with her sisters by seeing films like this ! Nothing much more to say except this film has a primitive charm that could interest animation history buffs . If you are interested in seeing this , it's easily available on YouTube ( at least it was when I found it there ) .
453872	11228318	151609	5.0	Molly Moo-Cow and the Indians is palatable but ordinary	Since the summary tells the whole story , I'll just mention some gags . When the Indian hunter takes the ducks away , the ducks each take an arrow from his backpack which forms a trail . As Molly is grabbing the hunter , she kicks him in the head with her hind legs ! And as the hunter escapes on a rowboat from the woman Indian throwing vases , the rowboat is still tied to a rope but the rope doesn't pull the boat back . Instead , it takes the boat's outer skin out leaving only the inside wood skeleton ! A bit more palatable than some other Molly Moo-Cow cartoons I've seen it is still a bit ordinary . Worth a look if you're interested in seeing every Van Beuren cartoon ever made .
454066	11228318	71548	5.0	TV movie Get Christie Love ! is interesting for historical purposes	Based on the book , " The Ledger " , Get Christie Love was the first time a black female portrayed a detective on network TV . Teresa Graves is adequately compelling as the cop with some attitude whose superior , Captain Reardon ( Harry Guardino ) , has a major open flirtation with her that she seems to occasionally encourage . The main plot concerns the search of a drug dealer's ledger through the interrogation of the wife in order to bring him down . Despite some fight scenes and car chases that attract some attention , the pace seemed mostly dreary and I almost fell asleep before the end . The most interesting discovery for me , however , was the appearance of Ron Rifkin as a serial killer of prostitutes named Normand whom Christie catches in the beginning when she dresses as one . Rifkin would , nearly three decades later , play Sloane on one of the most exciting action series ever-Alias . Compared to that show , this TV movie that later became a series doesn't have as exciting fight scenes but I guess network censorship was more stricter then . Worth a look for historical purposes .
454946	11228318	23889	6.0	Pals ( or Christmas Night ) was an amusing Van Beuren cartoon starring The Little King	Just rewatched this cartoon from the Van Beuren Studios on YouTube . The version I saw had the title Christmas Night which was the same title I witnessed when I first got this on VHS during the ' 80s . It stars The Little King , a popular comic strip character who is mute though other characters occasionally speak to him . Here it's Santa Claus who does the honors as he takes the King's request to deliver some presents to his palace for him and a couple of tramps he picks from a sidewalk window as they all look at the toys displayed . What they watch there is a little blackface doll tap dancing which is probably the only scene that would be offensive today in the entire cartoon though there is also a scene where all three are in a bathtub . Not too much in laughs though I was highly amused when one of the tramps revealed he wore a bra underneath his shirt ! Best scene is the climax as all three ride in their cars or plane and wreak some stuff in the palace joyfully ! So on that note , I guess I'm recommending Pals ( or Christmas Night ) .
454948	11228318	660859	6.0	The Last Laurel was pretty good filler as the last segment of " Night Gallery "	Airing in the same hour as " They're Tearing Down Tim Riley's Bar " , " The Last Laurel " is the shorter segment of " Night Gallery " . It stars Jack Cassidy as Marius Davis , a man who's paralyzed from the legs with a bad back who suspects his wife of having an affair with his doctor . When a collapsed bridge forces the doctor to stay in the house , Marius finds he has an out-of-body experience that allows him to pick objects up at will . So he picks up some scissors in order to kill his wife's alleged paramour . I'll stop there and just say that the length of about eight minutes seems just about right for this episode as one wouldn't want to spend another second with these not-so-very-nice people . So I don't think the ending effected me one way for another . And since I'm used to this kind of twist ending especially from writer Rod Serling , it really wasn't a surprise to me . Still , it was pretty good as filler goes . . .
454632	11228318	142894	6.0	The Tail of the Monkey was an interesting look at some early silent Lantz	Here's another Walter Lantz cartoon short I found on the CartoonsOnFilm blog . In this one , which he co-directed with David Hand , Lantz plays an organ grinder whose monkey steals a girl's lollipop in the live-action sequences . To keep the girl from crying , the organ grinder tells of why the monkey keeps moving his tail as we fade in to an animated version of the tale as the monkey fixes a horseshoe while his long tail gets burned on a grill ( why it's cooking nothing in particular is not explained ) . That tail also gets caught in a cheese-shaped mousetrap as tricked by a mouse who lives inside and holds the monkey up on a tree branch as he tries to make a giant hippo ring by 5 : 15 since his assistant went out to lunch at 5 ! The gags I just described are amusing in their primitive way in the animation and it's just fascinating just looking at what passed for movie cartoons back in the day . The Tail of the Monkey was an Unnatural History series entry for The J . R . Bray Studio where Lantz was an employee at the time . Worth a look for any animation buff out there .
453743	11228318	19714	6.0	Bosko the Talk-Ink Kid is interesting pilot for Warner Bros . cartoon series	Bosko the Talk-Ink Kid is Hugh Harmon and Rudy Ising's pilot film for an animated series they were shopping to various studios after working on the Oswald the Lucky Rabbit shorts for Disney and Mintz . Independent producer Leon Schlesinger accepted the pilot and commissioned a series of Bosko Looney Tunes shorts for distribution by Warner Bros . In this initial entry , Ising is at the drawing board drawing a little black figure . This figure's first line is , " Well , I'm glad to be free now that I'm out of the pen . " He then whistles and tap dances . He then asks for a piano which Ising obliges . Bosko plays and sings " Sonny Boy " but awfully ! Having covered his ears , Rudy can't stand it anymore and sends Bosko back into his pen with the piano and stool . After putting the ink back in the inkwell , Bosko comes back out and says , " So long , folks ! " The end title also says what Bosko just said starting the Warner Bros . tradition of ending the shorts with something other than The End . Amusing pilot for the Bosko series and an interesting start for the Warner Bros . cartoon studio . While the title character has something of a Negro dialect , there's nothing really offensive about him unless you consider a young black boy tap dancing as such . Certainly a nice tribute to Max Fleischer's Koko the Clown series . Worth seeing for animation buffs especially those of Warner Bros . cartoons .
453966	11228318	21687	6.0	Bosko the Doughboy is partly grim / partly funny	Bosko the Doughboy is a bit more grim than usual and since the previous reviewer discussed the short in much detail , I'll mention some gags that haven't been discussed yet . Like the one where the bullets take some of the body of another soldier to make him much smaller instead of killing him . Or the one where after a friend of Bosko's gets a cannonball stuck in his stomach , Bosko gets it out by simply zipping down his front part and taking the ball out of there ! Or the one where the dog soldier has fleas so Bosko solves the problem by getting his metal hat riddled with bullets so with the holes filled in the dog uses it to scratch his back ! Like I said , pretty grim with " gallows " humor abound . Still , worth a look for any early Warner Bros . animation enthusiast .
453744	11228318	292458	6.0	Boy Meets Dog is pretty entertaining Walter Lantz " cartune "	I saw Boy Meets Dog on Refederator . com and I saw no sign for Bristol-Myers both times I saw it . Based on the " Reg'lar Fellers " comic strip by Gene Byrnes , this short concerns a boy whose dad abuses him . And the boy's new dog is making it worse . As the dad falls asleep , he dreams of being in court for not treating his boy well . This dream is a musical sequence filled with dwarfs singing whether he's guilty or not . The judge acts like Curly Howard of the Three Stooges while the defending lawyers act like Moe and Larry . Judge later takes off beard revealing to be his son ! Dad gets sentenced to the youth machine where he is turned into a baby . It's at this time that he wakes up with puppy licking him as he turns a new leaf and gets along with his son and his friends . The end . The turn-around seems a bit much for the father but otherwise this is a pretty entertaining short for producer / director Walter Lantz . And besides , in a couple of years we'll meet two of his most famous creations : Anda Panda and Woody Woodpecker . . .
454198	11228318	396555	6.0	Meet the Robinsons is amusing in 3-D from Disney	Containing some elements you'll recognize from Back to the Future and The Wizard of Oz , Meet the Robinsons is a charming and amusing 3-D computer animated movie . A 12-year orphan has failed to get adopted more than 100 times because he keeps inventing things that always result in disaster . Then one day , someone a year older from the future takes him on a journey there in a time machine as he meets the Robinson family who provide him all the joy lacking in his present time . I'll stop right there and say while there is a rushed quality in the first 30 minutes , things slow down eventually to the point that you're left feeling inspired at the end . Wish the movie could be funnier but I wasn't completely disappointed . By the way , there is a punchline involving a Famous Celebrity that pays off at the end that I don't want to spoil here . And it's preceded by Working for Peanuts , an amusing Donald Duck / Chip ' n ' Dale cartoon that was also in 3-D when it first came out in 1953 . What awesome visuals both films had !
455233	11228318	1032855	6.0	Beim Fotografen was another " nudie " made by Austria's Johann Schwarzer	Once again on the Europa Film Treasures blog , I discovered another " nudie " from the silent era made by Austrian Johann Schwarzer . In this one , a photographer has a studio in which he has women come in and pose in the nude with occasional clothing . Then we see male customers come in and watch the results ( with inserts of many of those posed pictures provided ) just before a previous customer who refused to take off her clothes busts them all with the police in tow . The end . The last scene was pretty funny even now and I could have swore that woman who barged in was smiling as they all got out of the frame ! With all that said , I highly recommend Beim Fotografen to anyone curious about adult film entertainment from Europe during the silent era .
454057	11228318	1001589	6.0	The last part of Rosemary's Baby with Baldwin was the best one of " 30 Rock "	Liz reluctantly accepts a literally large check for " Follower of the Year " though she doesn't consider herself as such . She and Pete later go to a bookstore where she meets her writer idol who's named Rosemary ( Carrie Fisher ) . Rosemary gets hired as the guest writer who alienates everyone with her really far-out ideas . After meeting her , Jack wants her fired which Liz refuses to do . Liz gets fired as well as a result . Jenna accidentally burns Kenneth's jacket so she goes to the head page and tries to get another one for him only to get the head page to challenge Kenneth for a " Page-Off " in which they ask NBC trivia questions . Unfortunately , Pete calls this off after mentioning " there's no one at Conan's show right now " . Tracy has daddy issues since anything Jack tells him not to do , he does the opposite ( which explains Tracy's trying dogfighting ) . So Jack takes him to a psychiatrist but then Jack does several impersonations of Tracy's family ( including a father that sounds uncannily like Redd Foxx ) that Tracy responds to him instead and problem is now solved ( for now ) . After being sacked , Liz goes with Rosemary to her apartment and finds she lives alone with a rat and a train that runs by her window . Liz ' last straw comes when Rosemary proposes a movie about someone her age doing it with an 18-year-old that she believes with be a hit . As Liz leaves , Rosemary says , " Help me , Liz Lemon , you're my only hope ! " As Jack gives Liz her job back , he tells her about G . E . ' s problem with the " dog penis " sketch . Liz asks , " How about ' cat penis ' ? " . . . While this wasn't the normally funny show " 30 Rock " usually provides , I did think Alec's characterizations at the end were the most hilarious things I saw so far in this show . Reminds me how he got me in stitches whenever he was on " Saturday Night Live " ! Also wish the " Page-Off " got on a little longer . Carrie Fisher was a little uneven to me but love her references to both her marriage to a gay man and her famous Star Wars role of Princess Leia . Glad the ratings picked up this week . Will review again next week .
455103	11228318	402809	6.0	At One View is interesting if a bit pretentious	At One View is one of two shorts in Volume 5 of The International Tournee of Animation directed by Paul De Nooijer . The other one is I Should See . Two men are sitting in a chair reading newspapers . Then , through stop-motion photography , we see the chairs moving with the men still sitting down . The men stop to face us . They are now showing photos of each others faces in front of their own . The photos are now moving , again through stop-motion photography . Then we see slides of these photos shuffling automatically . This and the other scenes mentioned above continues for about 5 minutes . Then , at the end , the narrator , who's been speaking all this time , mentions how photography is basically trickery as we see the two men disappear in thin air . The end . Interesting if a bit pretentious , At One View is certainly worth seeing once as an experiment in stop-motion .
454016	11228318	910956	6.0	This Charming Couple provides an interesting look at a divorced couple's early courtship	This was an educational short from the McGraw-Hill Company about a couple about to divorce as we flashback to their courtship as a young couple just enjoying themselves in the forest without a care in the world . He-Ken-is an aspiring novelist who teaches literature in college . She-Winnie-is an assistant to a dean who thinks her fianc√©e will be famous which might make her life more exciting . While they're attractive and seem to get along well , neither believes in compromise . In fact , Winnie thinks Ken's friends are snobs while Ken wonders if he can live up to his wife's ambitions of him . We also hear views-via voice-over-from Winnie's roommate and one of Ken's students of each , respectively . And Ken also has a hobby of recording folk artists in their natural environment such as an elder woman singer in the forest that brings to mind the real-life Alan Lomax who did such things . Then there's the marriage at the end that the narrator tells of why it's doomed when he emphasizes the personality differences between them . Perhaps a little dated because of the way it's filmed and scored but This Charming Couple does provide some insights of why not all marriages live " happily ever after " . Oh , and as a Louisiana resident , I have to note that " Ken " is from New Orleans . To anyone wanting to seek this out , This Charming Couple is on the Internet Archive site .
453954	11228318	4707	6.0	See first feature comedy in Mack Sennett's Tillie's Punctured Romance	First off , I must mention that I may have seen an edited version of Tillie's Punctured Romance because in the print I saw , there was no film-within-a-film scene here . Also , the score picked for this version seemed suited more for a melodrama than the slapstick comedy that this surely is . Now , while I admit that some of the falls done by Marie Dressler seemed to be a little overdone , considering this was her first feature that can be excused and I found myself laughing pretty loud despite that . Charlie Chaplin also does nicely in the physical department which makes his jerk of a character a little easier to take . And Mabel Normand can take care of herself with all the slaps and kicks she gives to Charlie . I just wish the characterizations were more subtle and pacing was a little more subdued but I guess producer / director Mack Sennett didn't believe in that . For those performances , however , and those of Chester Conklin , Mack Swain , and many of the others who played the Keystone Kops at the end I recommend Tillie's Punctured Romance to any fan of silent movie comedies who are curious about this first feature film played for laughs .
454359	11228318	152262	6.0	Sadie Hawkin's Day marked the first time " Li'l Abner " was brought to the silver screen	Sadie Hawkin's Day was the first of five Columbia cartoons to feature Al Capp's comic strip creation , " Li'l Abner " . To anyone who doesn't know about the title's reason for being , here's an explanation : Ms . Hawkin was a homely girl whose father , being somewhat near-sighted , was puzzled why no one wanted to marry his , to him , pretty daughter . So he had a contest involving all the unmarried men running to avoid Sadie's clutches with the one caught by her " winning " her hand . Since then , this became an annual thing with many unmarried women attempting to catch a bachelor for her own . Abner , as always , is trying to avoid Daisy Mae from her catching him ( though I find myself wondering why as she's quite a looker who would be great in the hay ! ) . Anyone who's read the comic strip knows their eventual fate but it's fun watching Abner and Daisy Mae , and many of the other contestants , running around like marathon runners trying to avoid / catch each other . This was a nice start for the short-lived series though I'm sure even then there were some limitations that prevented a long run for this comic-to-screen translation . Still , for all that , Sadie Hawkin's Day is worth a look for " Li'l Abner " fans as well as those interested in Columbia Pictures animation .
454486	11228318	1155056	6.0	I Love You , Man was a reasonably amusing comedy for me	Let me admit up front right now that during some of the middle section of this movie , I partly fell asleep . So it's possible I felt a little underwhelmed watching I Love You , Man . That said , while I felt some of the scenes might have been underplayed and the pace wasn't as up as I'd like it to be , there were plenty of funny lines and scenes that I got reasonably entertained during most of what I managed to see . Stars Paul Rudd and Jason Segel are perfect together as a groom and his potential best man so they alone make the movie worth seeing . It's just that not enough seemed to be done to make the rest of the cast like Andy Samberg , Jane Curtin , J . K . Simmons , Jaime Pressly , and Jon Favreau really stand out though each have their moments . And leading lady Rashida Jones does well with what she has . So on that cautious note , I Love You , Man is at least worth a look .
454114	11228318	151950	7.0	Pots and Pans is another entertaining Van Beuren Tom and Jerry cartoon	Pots and Pans is another Van Beuren cartoon that stars a couple of humans named Tom and Jerry , years before a certain cat-and-mouse team from MGM inherited those titles after the human ones disappeared . They run a train diner with their name on it . Many of the food have faces and move . They also sing with various customers along with the leading duo . Typical ' 30s-style animation meant to mainly fill time before the big feature is at least a little more entertaining than any Saturday morning cartoon that has limited movement because of low budgets . Anyone interested in all eras of animation or at least all things Van Beuren should definitely check out Pots and Pans . I saw this on YouTube .
454554	11228318	30696	7.0	Room Service is no Marx Brothers classic , but still enjoyable nonetheless	30 years ago today , Groucho Marx died at 86 , three days after Elvis Presley . For the occasion , I'd thought I'd view some of his movies of which Room Service is one of them . Unlike the others he made with his brothers , this one wasn't especially tailored to their talents since it was originally a Broadway play starring other people . So the action is mostly confined to the hotel and the pace slows down a little bit . Nevertheless , there's still some witty lines and visual humor concerning Harpo that makes this one of the more enjoyable latter day-Marx Brothers films . And there's a wonderful supporting cast with Frank Albertson as the playwright and , especially , Donald MacBride as the hotel manager who keeps exclaiming , " Jumping Butterballs ! " Also of note is the fact that a couple of young players named Ann Miller and Lucille Ball appear here long before their established personas . So while not the classic of their five Paramount and first two MGM pictures , this RKO production was nothing the Marx Brothers should be ashamed of .
454728	11228318	32667	7.0	King for a Day is an amusing Gabby cartoon from Fleischer	If you read the synopsis provided elsewhere here , you know what happens . Mostly amusing with Gabby running frantically everywhere trying to avoid getting shot even though those banging noises come from other objects like the suitcase that quickly closes on the back of his shirt that gets stuck on him when he runs . There's also some gags about being chocked and getting hanged that probably wouldn't ever pass muster on Saturday morning cartoons even today . Made when the Fleischer Studio was in financial decline , only eight Gabby cartoons were made before Paramount fired Max and Dave and changed the name to Famous Studios .

453981	11228318	47673	7.0	Irving Berlin's White Christmas is wonderful holiday fluff for the ages	To celebrate Christmas and to pay respects to Mr . Bing Crosby who died a little more than 30 years ago , I decided to watch for the first time in its entirety , White Christmas . This movie made of Irving Berlin songs both old and new , also stars Danny Kaye , Vera-Ellen , Rosemary Clooney , Dean Jagger , and Mary Wickes with some familiar bit players like Herb Vigran and Grady Sutton . Also , George Chakiris , best known as Bernardo in West Side Story , is a dancing extra here . The story of two former army buddies - turned - musical - partners who meet a two sister singing act that's on their way to a lodge owned by the general of the former army pals is just a contrivance to put together various songs to fit in certain segments . Good musical performances abound with some of my favorites being " Choreography " with Kaye and Vera-Ellen making fun of Jazz-Ballet and the " Count Your Blessings " duet with Crosby and Clooney . While I said the story is pretty contrived , I also was mostly willing to go along with most of it as the performers made it all go down easy with director Michael Curtiz lending a brisk pace throughout . The now-classic song " White Christmas " was probably better handled in Holiday Inn by Bing some 12 years before but still , it's a good way to both begin and end this wonderful showcase to Mr . Berlin that's become a holiday classic for the last 50 years . P . S . - The picture that Vera-Ellen show of she and Clooney's brother that served with Bing and Danny is that of former Our Ganger / Little Rascal Carl " Alfalfa " Switzer !
454224	11228318	1039340	7.0	Rebel Yell was another good episode of " Miss Guided "	When vice principal Terry throws a punk band off the school yard , Becky recognizes the leader as someone who used to wear Cosby sweaters ( " You're my ' Cos " ) . Since Spring Break is arriving , Terry and Principal Huffy want the teaching staff to stay the night on grading papers . Guidance counselor Becky was just going to " sponge-paint " her office during that time but decides hanging out with Lisa and , especially , Tim would be more fun . So during their time checking papers , all three have chips even though they're in a room where no outside snacks are allowed . Then they have pizza and beer in the cafeteria kitchen which results in a Breakfast Club dance reenactment complete with them running when Terry tries to catch them . In hiding from him , Lisa and Tim go one way while Becky uses her knowledge of Bruce's secret entrance code to vandalize his office . Bad idea as he found out from a stuffed animal monitor of his but promises not to tell if she supports his security proposal to Huffy . She initially does but changes her mind when the punk rock student is threatened with punishment by Bruce for " looking like one who would vandalize his office " . So with Bruce's bodyguard's help , Huffy watches Becky's mischief in the vice principal's office on computer and makes her take charge of the Saturday detention class . Since Becky didn't reveal Lisa and Tim's contribution and vice versa , Tim shows up at detention to keep Becky company . . . Another amusing episode of " Miss Guided " with nice dialogue between Becky , Tim , and Lisa and excellent reenactment of the Breakfast Club montage . Maybe a bit more contrived that usual , but hey , what a good " wishful thinking " scenario with the three leads getting along so well together for once . Looking forward to seeing the rest of the episodes so on that note . . .
454528	11228318	1008002	7.0	Three-hour Live Earth on NBC had mostly enjoyable musical performances	Just finished watching the Live Earth three-hour concert version that I taped from NBC last weekend . Performance highlights include : John Mayer's " We Keep Waiting for the World to Change " , a reunited Genesis ' " Land of Confusion " , Alicia Keys ' " Mercy , Mercy , Me " which blended into Corrine Bailey Rae's version in the middle of the song , Kelly Clarkson's " Since You've Been Gone " , Roger Waters ' version of his group Pink Floyd's " Another Brick in the Wall " ( though I was surprised at it's inclusion ) and the recently reunited Police's " Message in a Bottle " . There were also good performances from Madonna , Bon Jovi , Trisha Yearwood and Garth Brooks , The Dave Matthews Band , The Black-Eyed Peas , and Duran Duran . Additionally , they showed snippets of musical acts in China , Japan , and Australia ( which showed an edited version of Crowded House's " Don't Dream It's Over " that I was disappointed with ) . All that plus hosts Ann Curry and Carson Daly interviewing public figures like Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Al Gore ( Curry ) and musicians like Keys and Matthews and actors like Rosario Dawson and Cameron Diaz ( Daly ) . All in all , a mostly enjoyable concert with important pro-environmental messages spread throughout ending with a clip of James Blunt singing " What a Wonderful World " .
454422	11228318	971260	7.0	The Source Awards is another amusing episode of 30 Rock	Liz accepts Tracy's invitation for all the " after-after-after " etc . parties . At many of these , she meets a nice African-American whose last name is Black and accepts a dinner invitation . At his office , Jack shows his new wine to Liz but after tasting it , they both get sick . Kenneth tells Tracy about encountering rap mogul Ridiculous whom Kenneth refused entry to Tracy's private parties at T . J . ' s request . Tracy gets upset just thinking of him and wants nothing to do with him . I'll stop there and say this was pretty funny though I had to rewind a few times to make sure I heard what I thought I heard during certain punchlines . Loved Wayne Brady's twist on certain black stereotypes and LL Cool J's satirical portrayal of certain rap celebrities . Nice to see Jason Sudeikis return as the flower guy from several weeks ago . The scene at the end certainly was surprising . Loved Tracy's Oprah impersonation . Hope enough viewers tuned in before the hiatus after next week . . .
453769	11228318	151657	7.0	Mr . Money Gags is a very amusing Famous cartoon in late-'50s UPA-style	This was one of the late Famous cartoons done in the style of the UPA-inspired limited animation look . Tommy Tortoise is driving from Hicksville to New York where he encounters Moe Hare as a cheating gambler who keeps trying , and failing , to swindle Mr . Tortoise out of his money . First Moe does the shell game , then 8-Ball , then dice , and finally , horse racing bet . There's a neat twist at the end . All I'll tell you is that the Tortoise does triumph here . Izzy Sparber is credited as director but most of the animated short's look is that of lead animator Al Eugster . I saw this highly amusing cartoon with the Harvey logo attached on YouTube as linked from Thad's Animation Blog .
454858	11228318	1055416	7.0	Gracie's Bully is another funny episode of " Back to You "	Kelly takes her daughter Gracie to the TV station for her class field trip since Gracie doesn't like the bus especially not with a boy who keeps pulling her hair there . Montanna wants to avoid a report on a flood since she can't pronounce the river's name . Gary bets Marsh he can't go through with " Casey at the Bat " in front of the class without crying for $150 dollars . And Chuck tries to threaten the bullying boy after he once again pushes Gracie but Kelly puts a stop to that before she herself gives the boy an ultimatum . That boy calls his mother ( Charisma Carpenter ) who confronts Kelly while Chuck , seeing how hot she is , shamelessly flirts with her . And Gary almost finds out about Gracie's connection to Chuck and Kelly . . . A pretty funny episode of " Back to You " that improves from the one that aired two weeks ago . Especially liked the ways Montanna kept mispronouncing the river's name and her jealousy of a young girl from the field trip constantly getting the word right when she practices her weather reporting duties ! Also liked the large kid that reminded Ryan of himself and Charisma's character naming her son " Xander " after the character on " Buffy the Vampire Slayer " whom Cordelia sometimes had an affair with . Also loved the constant hitting in the ears between Chuck and Kelly . Hope enough viewers have seen " Back to You " to ensure a continued run past this just-started writer's strike that threatens to halt production of all scripted shows for the rest of the season . . .
455205	11228318	14811	7.0	The Cure is amusing old hat animation from Max Fleischer	As Ko-Ko and a rabbit are drawn in a forest , Ko-Ko has a toothache . When he asks why , Max says , " Shut up ! " as we see him also have one . The rabbit then tries to pull the tooth manually before he asks for help . Max obliges by drawing an instrument that pulls teeth . When the rabbit uses it as he pulls , he notices a big bump form on the top of Ko-Ko's head . He pushes it back only to form on the clown's back . Then he pushes it only to form on the clown's face where his lips are ! Finally , he pulls a whole apple out of the mouth curing Ko-Ko . They then turn to Max who is using laughing gas on his mouth as they tie a rope to the bad tooth . Max doesn't want them to do it till he's asleep so as Ko-Ko and the rabbit pull , Max draws on his paper that , when the clown and rabbit are in the dentist's office , is revealed to be a lion they've been pulling into ! The lion wants his tooth pulled out . As Ko-Ko looks on , the rabbit goes to the waiting room where a worm asks to be next . He changes his mind , however , when he hears gunshots ! Turns out Ko-Ko killed the lion and made him into a rug when the lion threatened to eat him ! Next , comes a dog whose weak eyetooth gets glasses and a cap , a bird who gets an actual plate on his beak , a clam who gets some dismembered teeth , a walrus that gets an actual miniature bridge between his two teeth , and a rhino that gets a small actual crown on the spot where Ko-Ko pulled his nose tooth down ! Max , watching all this , puts the laughing gas in the drawing where everyone laughs uncontrollably . Ko-Ko then comes out of the board and goes with the hose inside Max's suit sleeve and points it at Max as he is now laughing along with the furniture , his car outside , and the building he inhabits ! Before his employees come back to work , Ko-Ko pulls the rope on Max's tooth with him attached as he's being moved through the floor until he bumps at a wall and finally gets his tooth out ! Ko-Ko and the rabbit now go back in the pen which Max closes . . . Pretty amusing excuse to put gags that have double meanings , The Cure is probably old hat for today . Still , it's worth a look for anyone interested in seeing the early stages of mixing live-action and animation in the early 20th century .
453774	11228318	443299	7.0	This was another wonderfully bizarre ' 30s cartoon from Japan	This was another weird and wonderfully bizarre Japanese cartoon from the ' 30s . In this one , planes stop at traffic in the sky like the cars below . And one of these planes is a cab that takes passengers . This cabbie , though , doesn't seem to be very good for humans since one of them has a bad encounter with this one after the cab goes into a black cloud that shakes all it's other victims out ! Instead , the cabbie seems more kind to animals like an eagle with a bad foot or a bear that also seems to be a bit handicapped . Other bizarre stuff happens here but I'll just say look this one up on YouTube . Oh , and there are no subtitles , just a Japanese woman narrating in her own language on a silent short with added music . It's under the title " The Plane Cabby's Lucky Day " .
454966	11228318	1204544	7.0	Hot Sub with guest ( who's also the show's producer ) Ashton Kutcher improves on previous first episode of " Miss Guided "	In this episode , executive producer Ashton Kutcher guests as " educational wanderer " Beaux who's teaching Spanish during his stay . Regular Spanish teacher Tim O'Malley is worried about going back to teaching shop so when the principal and his vice check on him a day or so early , Tim calls Becky for help . Unfortunately , she gets interrupted by Beaux who kisses her ( this being one day after Becky found out Beaux likes her and not rival Lisa ) with the result being Tim got a D on his teaching skills . Looks like he's going back to his old class but Becky then finds out student Mandy ( Jamie Lynn Spears ) is deciding to not go to college after talking to Beaux . When Becky and the school heads find out he didn't go to college , Tim's job is safe ( though we find out he's two credits shy of an actual degree ) . . . This was a little better than the first episode and Kutcher is perfectly charming in his role here . Loved the way vice principal Terry keeps sucking up to him even after Beaux's firing ( Chris Parnell does it again ! ) . As Becky , Judy Greer shows both her venerability with Beaux and her support with Tim who she likes immensely . " Miss Guided " is shaping up to be a pretty quirky show about what it's like to be employed at the same high school that you went to working with some former fellow students . I think this one's a keeper . Now I'm going to review episode # 3 . . .
454122	11228318	29969	7.0	While chaotic , The Captain's Christmas was a pretty enjoyable holiday cartoon starring The Captain and the Kids	Having just discovered this Christmas cartoon starring The Captain and the Kids on YouTube , I have to say-the plotting is all over the place what with peg-leg John stealing The Captain's disguise as Santa Claus , breaking into Mama and her boys'-Hans and Franz-house not to mention their toys and then vowing to make amends because of a crisis of conscience and not getting arrested for his previous doings ? Well , it is Christmas and forgiveness is ample here . Having said all that , there are some pretty funny gags here and I loved seeing John and his co-horts sing with their tongues moving up and down in rhythm and with Friz Freleng as director-having temporarily left Leon Schlesinger for M-G-M-you know you're getting some good musical animation . So with all that , I'll just be generous and recommend The Captain's Christmas .
455134	11228318	58725	7.0	Silly Viva Las Vegas showcase Elvis and Ann-Margret to great effect	Of all the lightweight musical movies Elvis Presley would make throughout the ' 60s , Viva Las Vegas is possibly be the most tolerable of a very silly group that became more ridiculous as the decade wore on . The plot has Elvis playing a race car driver named Lucky falling for swim instructor Rusty played by Ann-Margret who more than proves herself Presley's equal as his co-star compared to Elvis ' previous and subsequent leading ladies . Together they're dynamite whenever they dance close to each other side-by-side . Besides the title number and some of their duets , I especially enjoyed Rusty's " My Rival " about her jealousy over Lucky's car and the " What'd I Say " number with some other dancers ' moves highlighting the sequence . There's also a very exciting car race climaxing the picture . With the exception of William Demarest who I fondly remember as Uncle Charlie on " My Three Sons " , the supporting cast isn't all that compelling . But with veteran movie musical director George Sidney ( Anchors Away , 1951 Show Boat , Bye Bye Birdie ) at the helm , Viva Las Vegas becomes the kind of movie starring Elvis Presley singing that feels like a real musical as opposed to a comedy or drama with Presley songs put in for showcase purposes ( though that's sometimes the case here too ) . Final note : With the chemistry they displayed on-screen together , it's no wonder Elvis ' young girlfriend , Priscilla , got jealous whenever she read about him and Ann-Margret !
454218	11228318	1127384	7.0	The Loobenfeld Decay was a mostly amusing episode of " The Big Bang Theory "	Sheldon and Leonard are arguing the logic of the Terminator movies and TV series when they hear some awful singing . It's Penny who tells them she's performing in a local production of " Rent " for one night only and invites them to see her on stage . Leonard mentions that he and Sheldon are going to a symposium that night though Sheldon almost ruins that lie by nearly mentioning the real night of that . After she's gone , Leonard mentions to his roommate why he lied to Penny and the necessities of doing so for social purposes . Sheldon decides to replace that fib for a more complicated one about a cousin who's in rehab . That " cousin " later appears in the form of a fellow colleague / aspiring actor who argues about characterization with Sheldon . Hardly matters since Penny taped her performance and gets Leonard to watch while he leaves Sheldon and the " actor " alone with their bickering . . . Pretty funny , if not hilarious episode of " The Big Bang Theory " . As usual , Sheldon has much of the best lines though D . J . Qualls as the fake cousin steals the few scenes he's in with his constant embellishments . Penny herself has her moments when trying to explain to Howard and Raj the story that Sheldon told about his " cousin " . Oh , and as a Filipino born in this country , I was not offended by Qualls " childhood abuse " from a chaplain from that Asian country . Though according to Chuck Lorre's censored vanity card , it was originally supposed to be a Catholic priest ! ( Again , while Catholic , not offended . ) Very glad this show is back .
454491	11228318	148238	7.0	The Greyhound and the Rabbit was a pretty funny Columbia cartoon I watched on YouTube	Just watched this Columbia Color Rhapsody ( though the print I saw was in black and white ) on YouTube . It's basically a series of visual gags that takes place on a greyhound race track with the racers chasing a mechanical rabbit attached to a gate ( though the rabbit seems lifelike , at least for a cartoon ) . Among many funny ones : An announcer getting his dentures knocked out by a typewriter moving its whatever - that - thing - that - goes - left - to - right as operated by the person next to him , one dog making his " move " playing checkers , the rabbit attaching and reattaching his tail , when the dogs are in " photo finish " - one of them applies makeup as they all stop freeze-frame-like . So with all I just said , I'd recommend this Sid Marcus-directed cartoon , The Greyhound and the Rabbit .
455077	11228318	999889	7.0	Happy Birthday Elton ! makes a fine 60th celebration for the Rocket Man	Broadcasted on MyNetworkTV on April 5 , this 60th birthday celebration for Sir Elton John was a mostly enjoyable concert special that showcased some of his best hits from the last nearly 40 years from " I'm Still Standing " to " How Wonderful Life Feels " . When Robin Williams introduces him , he amusingly says Elton made " Liberace look Amish ! " You also see plenty of British and American celebrities say their own tributes on air . I loved the animated one contributed by Bette Midler . Near the end are stills of John in some of his most outrageous outfits including his famous Donald Duck suit . Many celebrities were in the audience including a stunning appearance of Anne Hathaway . Also stunning : Lily Allen in the tribute comments section . Happy belated birthday , Sir Elton ! Hope you have many more as enjoyable as this ! P . S . John's longtime songwriting partner Bernie Taupin also wishes Sir Elton Happy Birthday on stage and appears on the tributes .
454904	11228318	776023	7.0	The Hellcats is a pretty funny episode of " Mystery Science Theater 3000 "	After watching the original , uncut theatrical version of The Hellcats , I was anxious to watch MST3K's version . Loved many references to " How the Grinch Stole Christmas " that Joel and the ' bots threw at the screen . They also point out how pointless many motorcycle scenes as well as those that depict the cycle gang partying and copping a feel on some of the hot ladies are . They also make fun of the leading man , Ross Hagen ( who starred in another MST3K victim , The Sidehackers ) , and the director , Robert Slatzer , who has a role as a drug dealer here . The in-between segments has each of the characters doing a visual diary of their day in the Satellite Of Love complete with flashback scenes provided by Cambot . I loved the one when Joel points out pictures to the ' bots making them guess if it's funny or not . They correctly pick Sally Field as The Flying Nun as not ! LOL ! Very good episode of " Mystery Science Theter 3000 " . With the Christmas season coming , I may review Santa Claus Conquers the Martians next . Until then . . .
455137	11228318	72351	8.0	Uptown Saturday Night was an enjoyable first teaming of Poitier and Cosby	In reviewing movies in chronological order that featured African-Americans for Black History Month , we're now at 1974 with Uptown Saturday Night . This was the first of three buddy comedies that paired Sidney Poitier with Bill Cosby . This was also Poitier's third directorial assignment after Buck and the Preacher and A Warm December . Instead of the perfect professional characters superstar Sidney had been playing for years , here he's just a working class man named Steve Jackson who's pals with Cosby's Wardell Franklin . As Steve's wife Sarah , Rosalind Cash has some nice , and partially racy , dialogue with Poitier but Ketty Lester seems wasted as Wardell's spouse Irma . With a script by Richard Wesley , Poitier shows some amusing touches though it does take a while for the story , about getting robbed as the two leads spend the night at an illegal gambling joint called Zenobia's before Steve finds out his winning lottery ticket was among the stolen items , to kick into gear . When it does you get treated to a hilarious supporting cast like Flip Wilson as the Reverend , Richard Pryor as Sharp Eye Washington , Roscoe Lee Browne as Congressman Lincoln ( dig the way he turns a frame of Nixon to that of Malcoln X and then puts on his African digs when he meets his " constituents " Steve and Wardell ) , Paula Kelly as Lincoln's wife Leggy Peggy who the boys previously met at Zenobia's , and dancer Harold Nicholas as Little Seymour Pettigrew . That last character has a hilarious encounter with Cosby and Poitier himself cuts loose with some jokes you didn't think would come out of him . Also loved many of the " fights " the Cos instigates . Then there's Calvin Lockhart as Silky Slim and Harry Belafonte as Geechie Dan Beauford . These are rival gangsters that Steve and Wardell seek out to help find the stolen goods . Belafonte looks like he's having the time of his life impersonating Marlon Brando's Godfather role though I found him fitfully amusing like when he threatened to " knock the black off " Poitier and Cosby . Still , Uptown Saturday Night was a mostly enjoyable comedy that I bought on DVD with A Piece of the Action on the disc's other side . Dig Cosby's beard !
453864	11228318	63415	8.0	The Party is a nearly excellent non-Panther collaboration from Blake Edwards and Peter Sellers	After years of enjoying their collaborations on the Pink Panther movies , I finally got to see Blake Edwards'-Peter Sellers ' only non-Panther film , The Party . Playing a just-blacklisted Indian actor accidentally invited to a Hollywood party , Sellers inadvertently causes one disaster after another as guests just tolerate his presence despite no one really knowing who he is or why he's there . It's not until much later that producer Gavin MacLeod even remembers him for ruining his picture in the movie's beginning scenes . By then , Sellers ' character gets to know MacLeod's latest discovery ( and potential conquest ) Claudine Longet . Their scenes are some of the sweetest in this mostly very funny movie . And there's plenty very humorous stuff concerning mishaps caused not only by Sellers but also by a drunken waiter played to great hilarity by Steve Franken . It threatens to lose steam in the middle part but comes to a wonderful crescendo at the end . By all means , if you're a great fan of both Edwards and Sellers , don't pass this one by ! P . S . Having previously only known Ms . Longet from a shooting scandal of hers 30 years ago that was parodied on an SNL sketch the first season , I'm now glad to finally see her on screen as she was years before that unfortunate incident and hear her wonderful singing voice and French accent .
454260	11228318	27700	8.0	The Green Pastures is , despite some stereotypes , wonderfully inspirational	In reviewing African-Americans on film in chronological order for Black History Month , we're now at 1936 with the first all-black production for a major studio since Hallelujah ! from MGM in 1929 : The Green Pastures from Warner Bros . Rex Ingram stars in three roles-De Lawd , Adam , and Hezdrel . As De Lawd , Ingram brings a human dimension to the Supreme Being that expresses his doubts occasionally because of the way things turn out . Playwright Marc Connelly brought to his screenplay adaptation some wonderful humorous touches in retelling some of the bible stories like that exchange between De Lawd and Noah ( Eddie Anderson who I just saw at the beginning of Show Boat ) about whether to bring one keg or two of whiskey to the ark or Gabriel ( Oscar Polk ) saying he'll spit in the eye of Satan ! Among the females , Edna Mae Harris makes an impression in her brief role of Zeba who , after her boyfriend gets shot , takes a shine to the one who shot him ! Was most impressed with the Moses story especially the trick scene with the walking stick turning into a snake and what happened afterward when the Pharaoh initially refused Moses ' request to let his people go . The spiritual singing of the Hall Johnson Choir serving as score throughout was very inspirational . And having New Orleans being mentioned as the Sin City told this Louisianian how some things never change ! While , yes , there's some stereotypes about the Negroes being such simple people ( with heaven presented as a fish fry and the angels getting ten-cent cigars ) , there's also a message about tolerance and how , despite all that's wrong with the world , there's also plenty that's right that is made clear at the end when there's word of someone being nailed at the cross . . .
455065	11228318	871426	8.0	Tina Fey and Amy Poehler make a good team in Baby Mama	In a nutshell : real-life friends from SNL-Tina Fey and Amy Poehler-play an odd couple of sorts with Fey playing a businesswoman trying to have a baby and Poehler becoming a surrogate . No surprise concerning their chemistry and they're surrounded by a who's who of capable supporting players : Sigourney Weaver , Maura Tierney , Holland Taylor , Dax Shepard , Greg Kinnear , and Steve Martin as Fey's boss who likes to reward her with five minutes of staring at his face . Also look for former and current SNLers Fred Armisen , Will Forte , and Siobhan Fallon . Alternately hilarious and touching , Baby Mama should please many fans of the two leads and most of the above . So with that , I highly recommend it ! Oh , and congrats to Ms . Poehler and hubby Will Arnett on their upcoming blessed event !
454195	11228318	93870	8.0	RoboCop is Paul Verhoeven's classic sci-fi action picture	Quick , what do Peter Weller , Ray Wise , and Paul McCrane have in common ? If you say they were all in RoboCop , you're all halfway there . What they also have in common was they all were in Day 5 of " 24 " ( with McCrane's role partly expanded to Day 6 ) . Besides those names other familiar faces include Ronny Cox ( Beverly Hills Cop series ) , Nancy Allen ( ex-husband Brian De Palma movies , I Wanna Hold Your Hand ) , Miguel Ferrer ( " Twin Peaks " ) , and , in the movie's best role , Kurtwood Smith ( " That ' 70s Show " ) as the main villain , Clarence Boddicker . While partially predictable , RoboCop has some of the most badass action in movie history with wonderful humorous touches throughout . Director Paul Verhoeven really keeps a constant pace during the chase scenes . Check out Leeza Gibbons as one of the news anchors in the TV clip sequences . This movie is most highly recommended .
453757	11228318	33285	8.0	You , the People is another compelling " Crime Does Not Pay " short subject	Before I begin , I'd like to note that Bill Edmonds-Mr . Martini in It's a Wonderful Life-plays Louie the janitor here . Also appearing are " The Beverly Hillbillies " Raymond Bailey as Bailey Henchman and " Leave It To Beaver " s Hugh Beaumont as Pete . And that Barbara Bedford , who died in a city I once lived in-Jacksonville , Fla . - is a rooming house diner here . Shades ( or maybe not ) of the 2000 general presidential election , this " Crime Does Not Pay " short explores the illegal ways an incumbent mayor's re-election staff tries of " stuffing the ballots " and convincing the " regular folks " to stay home on election day . When someone tries to expose them , however , someone gets shot and police arrive as they try to burn the polling place . . . Gets pretty exciting at the end with the chases and shootings and is also compelling when someone at the end says to shut up since the person he talked to admitted he didn't vote . A pretty good account of how corruptness always seems to be around the corner near election day . Hope nothing like that happens this year with Obama now declared the Democratic presidential nominee . . .
454423	11228318	20264	8.0	Stan and Ollie star in the ironically titled Perfect Day	This is one of Laurel and Hardy's earliest talkies . It basically involves the boys ' attempt to take their wives and Uncle Edgar Kennedy , who has a gouty foot , to a picnic but because of car troubles are unable to get out . Hilarious use of sound effects throughout especially in the use of the car horn and the sound when Ollie hits Stan on the head with a clutch after Stan literally threw it out per Ollie's commands ! During one ad-lib scene between the wives and uncle , Kennedy says a swear word that I probably wouldn't have noticed had I not read about it in a Laurel and Hardy filmography book . All this plus a rowdy dog , some unruly neighbors-one of whom is Stan's buddy Baldwin Cooke , and brick throwing at windows and you have one of the funniest comedy shorts of the late ' 20s . Well worth the time for lovers of comedy in general !
453869	11228318	102730	8.0	Push Comes to Shove is bizarre Bill Plympton animation short	Push Comes to Shove is an animated short about two men looking the same doing various bizarre things to their faces . Like one pulling the other's ears forward , tying them in front of his face , getting a big rock in between the tied ears and pulling said ears with rock toward the face making a big fluffy hole on it . Or using grass seed with water on other's face , growing grass on it , and using a lawnmower to mow it down ! Or painting red marks on it so it looks like a baseball before hitting it , then another face appears literally from the neck up ! Like I said , pretty bizarre and highly recommend ! I saw this on Volume 5 of The International Tournee of Animation from 1992 . Well worth seeing if you like the offbeat .
453842	11228318	1248331	8.0	Generalissimo was another quite funny episode of " 30 Rock "	In this episode , a bunch of white male investment bankers recently laid off are now interns and have roped Tracy Jordan into some all-nighters which is ironic since Jordan quickly gets tired of them , Jack has a hard time impressing Elisa's grandmother because of his resemblance to the villain in her favorite telenova , and Liz checks out mail accidentally left in her apartment and finds out the owner is a handsome doctor just moved to her floor . . . What a hoot to see Alec Baldwin play both Jack and this soap actor with mustache . And this is the first of several eps to have " Mad Men " actor Jon Hamm playing this doctor Liz is smitten with . Not quite as hilarious as previous episodes but there's still some entertaining gems of humor like those concerning " roofies " ! I especially loved Liz ' villainous cackle as she starts acting just like that telenova villain . Next episode takes place on Valentine's Day so until next time . . .
455141	11228318	64217	8.0	Death of a Gunfighter was Lena Horne's only straight drama	In continuing to review African-Americans on film and television in chronological order for Black History Month , we're now at 1969 with Death of a Gunfighter with Lean Horne in her only straight role though you do hear her recording of the song , " Sweet Apple Wine " in the beginning and end credits . Though she's billed above the title with Richard Widmark , her role of Claire Quintana is very much a supporting one that's mainly there as one of the few people who stands by Marshal Frank Patch ( Widmark ) as the townspeople are fed up with his violent ways of dealing with justice . Also among the supporting cast are Michael McGreevey as Dan-a young man who also likes the marshal , Darleen Carr-sister of The Sound of Music's Charmian Carr-as his girlfriend Hilda , Jacqueline Scott-probably best known as Richard Kimble's sister Donna on " The Fugitive-as the widow , Laurie Mills , of the first man killed by Patch at the beginning of the movie , Harry Carey , Jr . as Rev . Rork , John Saxon as county Shriff Lou Trinidad who tries to get Patch to get out of town peacefully , and , in a nice surprise from his later role as Archie Bunker , Carroll O'Connor as the bar owner , Lester Locke , who bides his time in letting other people get Frank before he himself tries . Many of the cast I just mentioned and lots of others I haven't contribute great tension as the film chronicles the last days of the Marshal . Horne acquits herself nicely with her few scenes and it's nice seeing her and Widmark kiss at their wedding especially when one knows that Widmark played a racist opposite Sidney Poitier in his movie debut , No Way Out ( 1950 ) . Love the music score , by Oliver Nelson , and direction especially many of the close-ups . That direction , by the way , was credited to one " Allen Smithee " which is the name used when the real director doesn't want his own name used . In this case , they're Robert Totten-who had " creative differences " with Widmark , and Don Siegel-who had filmed the actor previously in Madigan . This marked " Smithee's " feature film debut . All in all , Death of a Gunfighter was another pleasant surprise for me .
454364	11228318	27371	8.0	The Blow Out was an interesting early Tex Avery cartoon featuring Porky Pig	The Blow Out was an early Warner Bros . cartoon that was the second made by " supervisor " Fred " Tex " Avery as director . It also starred Porky Pig in his early incarnation with original voice Joe Dougherty ( who stuttered in real life ) . Other voices featured were Sara Berner who was later gossipy switchboard operator Mabel on " The Jack Benny Program " , and Lucille La Verne who later voiced the Queen on Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs . She voices the bomber here . Porky is a kid here trying to buy an ice cream soda but finds he's five pennies short . So when he accidentally picks up a misplaced item from a passerby , he gets awarded one cent . After this gets repeated a few times , the pig finds the bomb-which he thinks is just an ordinary clock-and proceeds to give it back to the one who dropped it who of course keeps running away . Soon the cops follow . You may be able to guess what happens from here on but I'm not going to tell you . Needless to say , the ending is one you've probably expected from Tex Avery if you're familiar with his subsequent cartoons for both Warner Bros . and M-G-M . On that note , I definitely recommend The Blow Out .
454843	11228318	1055790	8.0	Gnothi Seauton is another pretty exciting episode of " Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles "	Having sent herself and the Connors ahead to 2007 by a computer that was hidden in a bank vault at the end of last week's episode , Cameron , after three days , now tells Sarah about getting new ID's . Sarah and Cameron go to an old friend named Enrique who tells them he's now retired and sends them to his nephew , Carlos . Carlos agrees to make the fake cards for $2000 . Meanwhile , tired of being a " statue " at home , John goes to a mall where he goes on computer to find about events that happened between 1999 and the current time but gets interrupted by an employee there before he finds out about his mother's death of cancer in 2005 . He does find out about Charlie Dixon , Sarah's fianc√©e , and sneaks into his house where Dixon's pleasantly surprised . John hits him before he can get any closer and leaves . Later , Charlie's wife asks him if he's all right . He says yes but his face reveals otherwise when she leaves . When the Connors and Cameron go to the safe to get the money , they hear footsteps . It's the " teacher " terminator from the previous episode ! They escape . After paying the money and getting their ID's , Sarah , knowing Spanish , overhears Carlos reveal his uncle as a rat . She goes back to Enrique who tells her he did not betray her . While she pointed her gun , it's Cameron who shoots from behind as Sarah cries over Enrique's dead body . It's later revealed from an FBI hidden recording that he lied to Sarah . . . Another exciting episode of " TTSCC " . Loved seeing Cameron do exact movements and attitude of a lady next to her as she stood outside while Sarah was dealing with Carlos . Also cool seeing her get knocked out by a car and thrown outside a window several stories down and then get back up several seconds later as if nothing happened ! And finding out that the wife of Charlie was also Penny of " Lost " from a TV Guide blog was another thing that was awesome ! Both episodes , while having some action , were slow in plot pace but next weeks preview shows the program should up the excitement considerably . So until next time . . . Update / 08-Correction : The terminator after the Connors and Cameron at the safe was not the teacher from the previous episode ( he was still in his skeletal phase with his head missing which he recovered here ) but a different one entirely . If the two out of five that didn't find my comment useful was because of that mistake , I now stand corrected .
454523	11228318	1091293	8.0	Sixth episode of " The Big Band Theory " makes the show get better	As Leonard , Sheldon , Wolowitz ( Simon Helberg ) , and Koothrappali ( Kunal Nayyar ) go to their apartment after playing paint-ball , Penny invites them to her costume party . Before that begins , they all prepare dressing as The Flash . Since no one wants to look alike , Leonard dresses as Frodo , Koothrappali as Thor , Wolowitz as Robin Hood ( though he keeps getting mistakenly identified as Peter Pan ) , and Sheldon as the Doppler Effect ( though some think he's a zebra ) . While the party starts at 7 and they arrive at 7 : 05 , Penny tells them no one really arrives on time . As the night goes on , they still haven't talked to anybody else so they all , well at least Wolowitz and Koothrappali , separate while Sheldon and Leonard stick to each other . They find Penny talking to her old boyfriend so Leonard cuts in with his friend in tow . The ex and Leonard exchange words that threatens to become heated but Penny manages to put a stop to that . Later when drunk , Penny plants a big one on Leonard and confesses she thought her ex had changed . Leonard , not wanting to take advantage of Penny's condition , lets her go . Meanwhile , Koothrappali , who normally has trouble talking to a woman , gets lucky with someone who thinks he's a good listener ! . . . Another funny episode and it's nice to see L and S's friends have almost equal status in this Halloween special . With " The Big Bang Theory " getting better with each episode , I'm glad CBS gave this a full-season order . Will review again next week . . .
453763	11228318	36046	8.0	Isle of Forgotten Sins is a rousing low budget adventure from Edgar G . Ulmer	Isle of Forgotten Sins is one of those rarities I discovered at my local library . In this case , this was one of Edgar G . Ulmer's low-budget poverty row pictures he made for PRC . John Carradine and Frank Fenton are rivals for gambling club owner Gale Sondergaard but they put aside their differences for a chance to get sunken treasure . Ms . Sondergarrd and her girls ( which includes a crafty Veda Ann Borg ) come along but all of them seem to be pawns for Sidney " Charlie Chan " Toler and his partner Rick Vallin . Also briefly appearing is Bill Edmonds-Mr . Martini in It's a Wonderful Life-as the island chief . Enjoyably and breezily fast-paced ( whenever possible ) B-movie that benefits from Ulmer's expert direction and a suitable underscore by Leo Erdody ( who like me was born in Chicago , Ill . ) mixed in with some public domain classical music . The composer is billed by his last name here . If there's some quibble , it's how some scenes obviously reveal how some boat scenes use a toy model and the underwater ones reveal the diving suit , which is also a small plaything , being manipulated . Otherwise , great fun with even some singing from one of the girls not marring the storyline too much .
453978	11228318	461770	8.0	Enchanted is a nice parody / tribute to fairy tales from Walt Disney Pictures	Walt Disney Pictures ' original animated / live-action musical comedy Enchanted is a mostly wonderful tribute / parody of various fairy tale films that made the company the most enchanting for family entertainment . Amy Adams is simply luminous as Giselle , the maiden who finds herself caught between James Marsden's Prince Edward from her animated life and Patrick Dempsey's Robert Phillip in the real New York one . Also featuring Susan Sarandon as the evil Queen Narissa and Timothy Spall as Nathaniel , her henchman . Then there's the chipmunk Pip , voiced by Jeff Bennett in Andalasia and the director Kevin Lima in New York when Pip can only communicate in chipmunk sounds . Finally , there's Idina Menzel as Robert's fianc√©e , Nancy , and six-year-old Rachel Covey as his daughter , Morgan . All players I've mentioned contribute wonderfully to this movie that lives up to its title . My favorite sequences , however , both involve Giselle when she sings her heart out in New York . The first involves when she calls to some animals to help clean Robert's apartment when he's gone and many of them are rats and roaches ! Then at Central Park when she starts singing to Robert about finding true love , he at first tells her to just keep walking then she encounters some Calypso musicians and they start joining in and then just everyone within walking distance do the same . Well , except Robert who insists he can't sing or dance ! The songs by Disney veterans Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz move along at a breezy pace . Also nice to see previous animated Disney princesses Jodi Benson ( Ariel ) , Paige O'Hara ( Belle ) , and Judy Kuhn ( Pocohantas ) make cameo appearances and to hear Julie Andrews herself narrate . All in all , Enchanted is another Disney movie that should be entertaining enough for all ages who want that feel-good happy ending with some clever satire that makes , in the words of Andrews ' Mary Poppins character from that Disney picture , " the medicine go down " .
454194	11228318	22714	8.0	Bosko's Party is a very entertaining Bosko short	I'm with the previous reviewer , this was a very entertaining short with plenty of gags and the wonderful musical number , " Suger , That's What I'll Name You " as sung by Honey . Loved the cat trying to get out of that flowerpot . Or the pig being too large to hide under the bed until Bosko takes a pin and " deflates " him enough to let him lower the bed . Or Honey getting dressed , recognizing the audience , hiding behind something as a mirror reflection still allows us to see her . Or the dog in the aquarium chased by Bosko . That dog is the same one that appears at the end with Bosko while he's saying , " That's all , folks ! " while the dog is barking . Is he a precursor to Bruno ? Anyway , worth a look for anyone looking for early Warner Bros . animation .
454630	11228318	1339246	9.0	The 31st Annual Kennedy Center Honors was a very classy awards show	Just finished watching this annual awards special which had the following honorees : actor Morgan Freeman , choreographer Twyla Tharp , surviving Who members Roger Daltrey and Pete Townshend , Country music singer George Jones , and singer / actress / director Barbra Streisand . Let me first mention some disappointments : When Denzel Washington mentions a " children's show " that Morgan appeared on in the ' 70s ( and they show a clip of ) , he neglected to mention the title : " The Electric Company " which entertained many children like myself when it aired on PBS from 1971-77 . Also , he didn't mention the first movie that got Freeman critical acclaim as well as his first Oscar nomination : Street Smart . Maybe that's because he played a pimp on that one . Not exactly the kind of role that inspires the American Dream . Also , The Who's musical tribute seemed too short to me especially compared to that of George Jones . That said , all the tributes were wonderful . I especially loved the NY police and firemen who survived singing the " teenage wasteland " line from " Baba O'Riley " back to Daltrey and Townshend . And how hilarious was Jack Black's speech at the beginning of their tribute ! And how wonderful were Kelli O'Hara and Nathan Gunn when they sang " Somewhere " in the Streisand tribute . And while I'm not really a Country music fan , I did enjoy Laura Bush's beginning speech and the musical tribute that followed . Finally , the couple that danced the " Sinatra Suite " - which played the entire recordings of " Strangers in the Night " , " That's Life " , and " My Way " - in Ms . Tharp's tribute were class exemplified . The same goes , as always , to host Caroline Kennedy . On that note , I salute all the 2008 Kennedy Center honorees .
453856	11228318	41760	9.0	Porky Chops is a very funny Arthur Davis cartoon	In a nutshell , Porky Pig is a lumberjack who's chopping down a tree that occupies a squirrel who wears pajamas , hangs a " Brooklyn Dodgers " banner over his bed , and reads the racing forms from the newspaper . The squirrel tries various ways to shoo the pig away like putting aluminum siding on the tree and then disguising it with varnish as Porky fails to chop with various axes that keep losing their sharp heads . Many funny chase gags abound and a twist involving a bear especially pays off here . This cartoon came from the short-lived Arthur Davis unit and it shows how talented Davis really was with the timing of the gags and pacing that also marked his predecessor , Bob Clampett . Too bad , due to budget constraints , Warner Bros . later had to cut Davis ' staff . Porky Chops is highly recommended .
455139	11228318	416236	9.0	The Spiderwick Chronicles provides wonderful family entertainment	This was another movie I picked at random for me and my friend to see during our free time . It was playing at a theatre that he's supposed to start working at soon . This was an enchanting movie concerning goblins , fairies , and ogres as well as children affected by divorce and an old lady who misses her long-lost father . There's also some nice humorous touches concerning another creature named Thimbletack who only calms down by drinking lots of honey . He is voiced by Martin Short . Also in the cast are Nick Nolte who voices Mulgarath and appears as him in human form , David Strathaim as Arthur Spiderwick , Jordy Benattar as his young daughter-Lucy , Joan Plowright as the now much older Lucy , Mary-Louise Parker as the mother Helen Grace , Andrew McCarthy as her ex-husband Richard , and as her children , Sarah Bolger as Mallory , and Freddie Highmore as Simon and Jared Grace . I and my friend were pretty much captivated by everything that went on in this movie though initially I was a little irritated by how Mallory kept on harping on little brother Jared . Anyone with kids or is a kid at heart should also enjoy this wonderful production from Nickelodeon Studios . So on that note , I definitely recommend The Spiderwick Chronicles .
454680	11228318	1054847	9.0	The Kindness of Strangers is another good episode of " Heroes "	Twins Maya and Alejandro have escaped from a jail in Houndaras with an American named Derek and are now in Claire's stolen vehicle somewhere in Mexico . They stop when they see a man unconscious on ground . It's Sylar !

At his and Mohinder's apartment , Matt gets Molly to track his dad . She succeeds but falls into a coma as she asks Matt for help in his mind . . . Surprising revelations about Matt's family connections concerning his ex-wife and her child as well that about his father . Looks like Molly's his surrogate daughter . Cool new character in Monica . Nice to see Nathan clean shaven again ! Isn't that burger manager the same boss of Buy More on " Chuck " ? Lots of intriguing stuff for this week's episode . Can't wait for next week when " Veronica Mars " star Kristen Bell comes aboard . . .
454006	11228318	59243	9.0	Blake Edwards ' The Great Race is one of the finest comedy epics ever !	After about 25 years of only seeing part of this hilarious epic comedy from Blake Edwards on TBS's " Academy Award Theatre " and having taped this unedited version on AMC about 15 years ago , I finally got to see the entirety of this just three hours ago and I've got to say I'm very glad I did ! First off , Jack Lemmon ( audience cue : " Boo ! Hiss ! " ) is excellent in playing both the villainous Prof . Fate and later on the lookalike Prince Hapnick ( what a laugh he does ! ) . As The Great Leslie , Tony Curtis ( " Yay ! " ) provides the amusement of constantly shining his white teeth with Edwards ' assistance of course . And then there's Natalie Wood who as reporter Maggie Dubois is frequently trying to one-up Leslie and others on her superiority concerning women's rights . Of the three , Lemmon comes off best as he's consistently funny throughout with great help from Peter Falk as inept assistant Max . Keenan Wynn as Leslie's right-hand man Hezekiah is less so but manages okay with what he's got . Other fine support come from Arthur O'Connell as Maggie's newspaper boss , Marvin Kaplan as his assistant , Vivian Vance as the wife of said boss , Hal Smith as a town mayor , Denver Pyle as the sheriff , Ross Martin as a fence / sword dueler with Leslie , Larry Storch as Texas Jack , and Dorothy Provine as singer Lily Olay . Screenwriter Arthur A . Ross ( who's from my original hometown of Chicago , Ill . ) provides great punchlines for the stars and Edwards constantly fills the screen with several visual touches , including the biggest pie fight ever , that bring to mind the great silent comedies of the early 20th century . In closing , while The Great Race is a little overlong , it's still entertaining enough from beginning to end and should provide enough enjoyment for the whole family . Oh , and how touching to print at the movie's beginning " For Mr . Laurel and Mr . Hardy " . . .
454724	11228318	1235057	9.0	Believe It or Don't is a rare live action / animated short that survives from the work of Charles Bowers	Just discovered this unusual live action / animated short on the Europa Film Treasures site . It's made by the now obscure experimental film maker Charles R . Bowers , an American . A parody of the Ripley's " Believe It or Not " shorts series , Believe It or Don't has three narrated segments : a circus act entirely performed by peanuts with stick hands and legs , a hen that lays eggs from which toy autos come out of , and a humanized lobster who looks like a saloon singer walking the streets but actually becomes cheery when he plays the xylophone ! While the short looks primitive today , Bowers ' Believe It or Don't retains its entertainment value especially during the last sequence that should still amuse some little ones under the age of 10 . Highly recommended .
454659	11228318	22288	9.0	George and Gracie are Pulling a Bone	Gracie's boss at the soda fountain tells her she's five minutes late . He also tells her to be polite to her customers or she'll be fired . Gracie asks her workmate if she could at least ask for a raise . A customer complains to manager about the service and refuses to pay . Manager says he'll accept that and offers to pay him two dollars to do the same to his competitor across the street . Customer says he got three dollars to do what he just did ! George goes to a nearby perfume saleswoman and exclaims he has a bone in his throat . She tries to sell him some supplies . George goes to Gracie's corner and she talks about being on an airplane for six months . And trying to get a parasite . And laws of gravity . All this while George keeps exclaiming about " a bone in his throat " ! Then Gracie gets busy with customers . . . Once again , Burns and Allen are amusing with the non-sequeters and puns and what have you . This was made right after their first ( or second ) short , Fit to Be Tied and even this early on George and Gracie are natural on screen . Definitely seek this out if you're a Burns and Allen fan !
454005	11228318	441773	9.0	Kung Fu Panda is one of the best from Dreamworks Animation yet	While I admit to falling asleep at some scenes ( parts of Tai Lung's escape and some of Po's training ) , I was mostly highly amused and entertained by what Shifu ( Dustin Hoffman ) was teaching Po ( Jack Black ) . In fact , this was one of the most entertaining of the Dreamworks Animation features . Po gets befriended by five other of Shifu's students : Viper ( Lucy Liu ) , Monkey ( Jackie Chan ) , Crane ( David Cross ) , Mantis ( Seth Rogen ) , and Tigress ( Angelina Jolie ) . The villain , Tai Lung ( Ian McShane ) , was another student of Shifu's whose attitude got him jailed for 20 years . Also of interest is Mr . Ping , Po's restaurateur father ( James Hong ) , who turns out to be quite an inspiration to his son though it doesn't seem that way at first . Black's line readings and the animation movements of his panda character are some of the funniest I've seen and heard on the screen yet and the relationship between Po and Shifu are some of the best mixture of funny and touching especially the end scenes that end up quite differently than you'd expect ( perhaps the fact Kung Fu Panda is mainly meant for kids have something to do with it ) . So on that note , this movie comes highly recommended for the whole family though it's okay if you just watch this alone or with a friend as I did . P . S . I loved the 2-D animation that began this movie ( which included the unique way the Dreamworks logo was done here ) .
454014	11228318	37758	9.0	A Gun in His Hand is another " Crime Does Not Pay " short well worth seeking	This is another of M-G-M's " Crime Does Not Pay " shorts that appeared in the " Special Features " section of the DVD " Film Noir : Bringing Darkness to Light " . In this one , rookie cop Dennis Nordell ( Tom Trout ) , after graduating from police academy , goes back to his crooked friends in order to pull one heist after another of various warehouses . He seems to have thought it all out , but at the last minute , after he killed a veteran on the force and got transfered to homicide and then tries to finger a crook with a record , some small clues trip him up . . . Another compelling entry in the series that provides some added excitement of underscoring and narration by a mentor of some new recruits about Nordell with a lesson to them at the end . Well worth seeking out for anyone interested in these vintage stuff .
454841	11228318	148276	9.0	The Herring Murder Mystery is a rare Columbia cartoon that's nearly excellent	This Columbia Screen Gems cartoon begins with a fish screaming as she gets marinated and put in a sardine box . The man who does it feels guilty and as he starts to walk out he hears footsteps that he repeats a few times . Then smoke appears and when it fades a talking fish that's taller than the man shows his card that says " Sherlock Shad " , a detective investigating a " murdered herring " . He and a fellow fish put the man in a barrel and toss him underwater where he ends up in trial with other fish and a shark lawyer . The rest of the short is filled with bad puns ( like " boiled lobster " or , oh , I can't remember ) and a fish jury constantly singing , " There's something at the end of a hook . . . but it's shad roe / shad roe / shad roe to me / ! " ( shad roe basically meaning baloney ) This is one cartoon from Columbia that has the kind of nuttiness that you expect from Tex Avery or Bob Clampett from Warner Bros . or MGM . In fact , there's an Avery-type gag of no sound coming out of the man's mouth with the judge and lawyer asking why and the soundtrack line basically saying there's nothing wrong and telling the man to just speak clearly ! What a hilarious surprise that was ! Found this on Daily Motion as linked from a blog by someone named Thad . Highly recommended .
455244	11228318	1248337	9.0	Apollo , Apollo was another very funny episode of " 30 Rock "	In this episode , Liz is visited by former " sex partner " Dennis who's trying to make amends for his behavior . She then finds out on Jenna's phone that Dennis had sex with her as well . Having accomplished almost everything on his list since his 10th birthday , Jack wants the excitement of that childhood back in a bad way . And Tracy wants to fulfill his own dream of going into space . . . How welcome to see Dean Winters back as Dennis ( not to mention as Charlie on the next to last episode of " Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles " this season ) ! This particular episode of " 30 Rock " was very funny from beginning to end especially the way Kenneth sees everybody he encounters as Muppets ! And hearing Liz impersonate Jenna as British on Jenna's phone to Dennis and then Jenna explaining that she lost her virginity to the My Fair Lady soundtrack was a clever touch . And then there's this commercial Liz did for a phone sex line in Chicago . And how about that Adam West cameo . . .
454069	11228318	892439	9.0	The C Word is another excellent episode of 30 Rock	Jack invites Tracy to a party of the network CEO . Tracy accepts . Liz has been driving the writers crazy with her demands for scripts and overhears one of them calling her a very nasty word . It's the one that rhymes with " runt " which is what the animal wrangler says when the other word is spoken . Kenneth is awkward around fellow page Grace Park and tries but can't avoid her . Tracy makes a fool of Jack when he wants to know why there's only one other black man at the party . Liz tries to overcompensate for her bossiness by giving various treats . I think that's all I'll reveal for now except to say this delayed episode was one of the funniest I've seen though still not close to Tracy Does Conan levels . This was Rachel Dratch's third ( or second , depending on when this was originally supposed to air ) appearance as the animal wrangler and is hilarious in the constant saying of " runt " . Rip Torn is sublime as the CEO and everything between Tracy Morgan and Alec Baldwin is way funny . And Tina Fey's speech at the end proves her worth as an actress as opposed to just being the writer and producer of this often ratings-challenged show . ( Damn you CSI and Grey's Anatomy ! )
454512	11228318	1055795	9.0	The Demon Hand was another compelling episode of " Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles "	As the episode begins , Cameron is dressed as a cop . She's going to the police station to put the power out with her hand so she can get the dismembered hand from the Terminator she killed . A look at the sheet list reveals it's in the possession of Agent Ellison . After Cameron goes home and tells Sarah about the hand , Sarah tells her to look for the man who took the Turk from Andy , Dimitri . Cameron poses as a ballet dancer to find his sister , Maria . It's there she overhears her and Dimitri talking about their troubles with the Russian mob in their native language . Agent Ellison watches some tapes of Sarah when she was put in a mental institution and watched by a Dr . Silberman . He goes to where the doctor now resides : a cabin in the woods . Silberman acts kindly towards him initially then cuts his knee after poisoning him with tea to find out if he's a machine . Ellison then gets tied up and almost killed when Silberman sets fire to his own house . Sarah saves the agent after punching Silberman before taking back the hand to later burn . Ellison then turns Silberman in the same room Sarah was held in . After Cameron gets info from Dimitri about where the Turk is , she leaves him and his sister just as the mob comes up to kill them . During much of this time , John watches one of the tapes of his mother that she earlier took from Ellison's house and is saddened to find out she had years before singed away parental rights when she left him in the care of some now-dead foster parents . And Derek and Cameron each declare that they knew each other from before and Derek tells her , " You may have fooled the others but you haven't fooled me . " Though he must wonder how human-like she's becoming when he sees her ballet dancing to some familiar music . . . While this was more of a drama with expository dialogue that references T2 : Judgement Day , most of it was compellingly played . Certainly the scenes involving Silberman and Ellison were some of the most shocking I've seen so far in this series . And how wonderful to see Summer Glau put her dancing skills to good use here ! No wonder she has such a nice figure . Brian Austin Green gets better with each episode and has managed to ditch his previous role as 90210's David Silver forever ! Can't wait for the two-part season ( hopefully not series ) finale so until next time . . .
455145	11228318	1054848	10.0	Fight or Flight is another excellent episode of " Heroes "	With Molly in a coma , Matt vows to find his father who made her that way .

In New Orleans at work , after talking to the police and lying about not knowing the attacker's face , Monica goes home to find Micah playing the piano .

He then looks in Kate's canvas and paints a picture of two men at the doorway under some street signs there . Also , a mysterious woman named Elle ( Kristen Bell ) is looking for Peter . She's revealed to have powers of lightning coming out of her hands which Peter also had the last few episodes . When she confronts Kate's brother Ricky at the bar , Ricky claims he's never seen Peter but Elle had already talked to others ( including the one who tried to kill Rick the previous week ) who had seen him and locks the door before she does her deed . So when Kate finds out about it , she's in tears as Peter tries to console her and vows vengeance . . . Wow , another exciting episode of Heroes has come and gone ! Loved the editing of the Nathan / Matt fight in which Matt was supposedly fighting a guard from jail and Nathan was supposedly his bloody self . Also loved the Monica / Micah bonding . Looks like Peter is getting out of Ireland with maybe Kate in tow . How is Mohinder going to fare in New Orleans with Monica and Micah ? And just what is Noah and Hatian doing in the Ukraine ? Kristen Bell was okay in her " Heroes " debut . And was that really her " Daddy " she was talking on the phone ? Lots that and more to ponder so until next time . . .
454761	11228318	398808	10.0	Bridge to Terabithia is a wonderfully essential family film	Based on the Newberry Award-winning book , Bridge to Terabithia is the story of two tween outcasts , Jesse and Leslie , who bond over their creative endeavors , drawing and writing , respectively . After school , they swing a rope across the brook and go to their tree clubhouse where they imagine being in the land of Terabithia , fighting various creatures and racing each other . Josh Hutcherson and AnnaSophia Robb are wonderful as the lead characters . Among the adults , I especially liked Zooey Deschanel as the music teacher and Robert Patrick as Jesse's dad . Despite some sadness along the way , this is essential viewing for the whole family . Kudos to Gabor Csupo and the Disney Company for making it .
453848	11228318	808435	10.0	A Raisin in the Sun marks my farewell comment for Black History Month	This entry of the 2008 TV movie version of Lorraine Hansberry's play " A Raisin in the Sun " that just aired on ABC four days ago , is my final entry on African-Americans in film and television in chronological order for Black History Month . Nearly the entire cast of the recent Broadway revival of this still-resonant drama-Phylicia Rashad , Sean Combs , Audra McDonald , Sanaa Lathan , and Bill Nunn-reprise their roles here . They're all great as well as Sean Patric Thomas , David Oyelowo , Paul Stephen , and , as Carl Linder-the man who tries to buy the Youngers out of their new house , John Stamos . Rashad and McDonald , both of whom won Tonys for their performances , should repeat at the Emmys this fall . Combs , usually known as Puff Daddy / P . Diddy / Diddy , holds his own with the experienced veterans here . Scenes such as Rashad slapping daughter Lathan after the latter denounces God or Combs doing his " shufflin ' Negro " act near the end to everyone's disgust still packs a wallop . And writer Paris Qualles , whose work I just watched on The Rosa Parks Story , and director Kenny Leon open up the play's locations and expand on the dialogue considerably well . What else can I say except it's been a wonderful journey watching how much African-American performers and filmmakers have evolved over the nearly 90 years with nearly 100 listings here at IMDb during this special month . With the writer's strike still in effect at the beginning of it , I thought this was as good a time as any to celebrate some of the most acclaimed and popular celebrities America and the world has ever known . With that , I'll just say thanks for anyone who's read this and my other BHM comments and gave me favorable and even not-so-favorable marks as a result . Oh , and feel free to read and mark my other non-BHM comments as well !
454634	11228318	47678	10.0	Wild Wife is a great Robert McKimson cartoon	Just watched this Warner Bros . cartoon on YouTube . In it , husband John ( Mel Blanc , of course ) asks his wife Marsha ( Bea Benaderet ) if she's done various chores . When she replies " no " on the lawnmower question , he tells her she doesn't do enough work during her free time . Marsha rebuts with a tale of what her work day entailed . . . Director Robert McKimson fills this day - in - the - life - of - a - housewife premise with lots of hilarious verbal and visual gags that keeps building until the much deserved finale . And the stylized ' 50s design that was probably UPA-inspired is perfect here . And music director Carl Stalling , as always , provides many familiar music cues-like the " Powerhouse " score by Raymond Scott which is my favorite-their suitable moments in the short . So for all that , I'm highly recommending Wild Wife .
455131	11228318	495201	10.0	Suzy Snowflake is another classic holiday stop-motion animated short	Like a previous song " Hardrock , Coco , and Joe " , " Suzy Snowflake " was made into a stop-motion animated short by Centaur Productions . As with the previous one , the choir sings with no musical accompaniment . They are the Norman Luboff Choir with Norma Zimmer singing lead . She would eventually be a " Champagne Lady " for Lawrence Welk . This was a pretty amusing short about the title character who makes snowmen . Loved the scene of a human innocent bystander accidentally becoming one . As with the above and a couple of UPA shorts , Frosty the Snowman and Peter Cottontail , they were all licensed by the song publishing company Hill and Range and were staples of kids ' Chicago TV for years . As with the others , this one is definitely worth a look .
454419	11228318	208558	10.0	Vinni Pukh i den zabot is another charming Russian Pooh short	Another Russian Pooh story . This time the donkey , known from the Pooh stories as Eyeore , is sad because he has no tail . Pooh goes in search of one and finds it attached to a bell that hangs from the treehouse of one Owl . She ( yes , in this version it's a she ) is offered a bowl of honey from Pooh but she refuses to give the tail in return . Meanwhile , Piglet searches for a flower . I'll stop there and tell you that this short is twice as long as the previous ones at 18 minutes . The music , as usual , is charming and there's humor and sadness that should charm anyone , regardless of age or nationality , interested in all animation . Check it out on YouTube .
454186	11228318	682	10.0	Fantasmagorie is a fascinating early animation short of chalk drawings	Emile Cohl's Fantasmagorie is perhaps one of the earliest film depictions of animation , in this case it's chalk drawings on a black board morphing from one scene to another without any real connection except for the way lines keep moving to any shape or form Cohl can think of . And it all happens in the space of two minutes ! So , historically , this is one of the most fascinating animated shorts ever . Audiences might have been even more awestruck then than we would be now what with all the improvements that have happened in the nearly one hundred years since then . So for all of the above reasons , this short gets a 10 .
454657	11228318	613721	10.0	Smothers Brothers guest on final Jack Benny Program	This final regular episode of The Jack Benny Program starts with The Smothers Brothers singing what has long been Jack's Theme : Love in Bloom . Tom , of course , interrupts halfway through with Dick expressing annoyance throughout before completing their number . Jack then talks to the boys before they go to their skit : A " What If ? " concerning Jack's encounter with the boys during WWII . The skit ends with all three blown up then we see them ( or their dummies ) fall down at Benny's regular home stage and ( after editing ) reacting to what just happened . Jack and the brothers wave goodbye to us for what Jack must have thought was the last show of the season but turned out to be the final regular episode ever . He would only do occasional specials until his death in 1974 . This episode was amusing throughout and has no dated elements but low ratings made this Jack's only regular season on the NBC television network after fourteen years on CBS . I saw this on a Universal VHS with a hilarious Peter Lorre ep preceding it . By all means , seek this out !
455239	11228318	1127271	10.0	The Gallery Show is the best episode of " Samantha Who ? " I've seen so far	In a nutshell : Samantha receives an invitation to ex Todd's photo gallery show . She goes to the apartment intending to tell him she's not going but Todd spills that Chloe didn't want Sam to come . So Sam tells him she's now dating someone named Rance . Moments later , after failing with Andrea and Dena's help to find someone suitable at the library , Sam finds someone trying to illegally unlock a car named Craig ( Jerry O'Connell ) . She's found her Rance ! At the gallery , her parents Regina and Howard are looking around with Howard bored throughout when they spot a picture of a naked woman with no head and her breasts covered by her arm . Howard stops at that then turns when Regina reveals it's their daughter . Meanwhile , Dena turns up at the wrong gallery that has a talking man in a glass cage because Andrea intentionally gave her the wrong instructions . The glass cage man gives her the right one after getting irritated at Dena's constant jabbering . Back at the real gallery , Craig offers to take her coat and purse which gives Sam a flashback of when her bad self was mugged . Guess who the mugger was ? So Sam tries to get him off the premises before anyone noticed just as she confronts Todd and Chloe . After the usual rounds of " I'm over you " , Sam tells Craig about their earlier encounter and Craig confesses stopping after encounter after she broke his arm . Just as things become okay with them however , the alarm sounds when Craig leaves temporarily prompting Sam to shout " Thief ! " Turns out Howard was stealing Sam's photo to keep anyone else from looking . That prompts Chloe to bare her breasts to Todd in a fit of jealousy . Oh , brother ! After Craig leaves for good , Todd admits to Sam he put the red dot ( meaning it had been sold ) on her display because he couldn't part with it so it seems they might be an item again . Just before they leave together , Dena finally arrives with Chapman to tell Andrea her new office will be in the copy room ! . . . Wow , this episode fired on all cylinders ! The lines were so hilarious here that I dare not quote them lest I spoil anyone's else fun . If anyone wonders if the girl - loses - memory - tries - to - be - better - person premise would actually work for the long run , the events happening here seems to be as good a place as any to apply in the affirmative . With only two episodes left , I can't wait to see how it all ends up this first season !
455066	11228318	1127270	10.0	The Butterflies is another hilarious episode of " Samantha Who ? "	As Sam talks with Dena about her encounter with Todd in the last episode on her way to work , her boss , Mr . Chapman , walks by . He overhears Dena tell Sam to " let your heart be your dog " in comparing love and pets . When Sam gets on the elevator with Chapman , they both stay quiet until Chapman , about to exit , tells her , " I want her . Make it happen " . Sam is reluctant even after Andrea tells her about wanting new chairs that make butts comfortable . Then she realizes her mall project has attracted protesters because it's being built on a ground with rare butterflies in danger of extinction . So after Dena agrees to date Sam's boss and getting along so well with him as a result , Sam and Andrea give their requests which Dena relays to him . The result : Andrea gets her chair but Dena got convinced how good business the mall project is . Then Sam comes up with alternate plans that would spare the butterflies but all her boss can talk about is Dena and wants to know from Sam what her feelings are for him . Sam agrees on condition the mall project is delayed . She then convinces both lovebirds to hold back on their feelings and also tells Chapman about Dena's old boyfriend coming back . With both finding out the truth at dinner however , Dena admonishes Sam about her intentions and says the bulldozers are operating in the morning . Sam's joining the protesters gets her on the local news and while apologizing on-air to Dena as she and Chapman are about to make love , Dena accepts . With the dozers still going through however , Sam quits her job and waits with Frank the doorman for Todd , who brushed her off the last time by lying to her of a new photo job with the local paper , to come out . As he does and tells Sam of wanting to make it work with Chloe , Sam kisses him , then pushes him back saying , " Lose some sleep over that ! " She then leaves with her belongings as she encounters that rare butterfly which continues flying through the credits and the logos at the end of the program . . . Another hilarious episode of " Samantha Who ? " with highlights being the chemistry between Melissa McCarthy and Rick Hoffman . Their dialogue and facial expressions are so spot on here . Jennifer Esposito as Andrea is also compellingly funny here whether enjoying her new chair or the coffee machine as the result of Dena's newfound stature . Can't wait for the next episode so until next time . . .
454637	11228318	424016	10.0	The Cunning Little Vixen was a wonderfully animated version of Leos Janacek's opera	Just watched this animated featurette of Leos Janacek's opera as directed by Geoff Dunbar on YouTube . It's mainly about a female fox who as a child gets taken from her mother to this man's house . Three months later as an adult , she escapes but not before killing all the chickens that her master and his wife had raised . Back in the forest , she meets a male fox and falls for him . After she gets pregnant , he agrees to marry her . . . I'll stop right there and say this was a pretty touching story of this lady fox and her adventures despite her brutal nature concerning other animals . Both the music and the voices chosen to verbalize the story are wonderfully played throughout . And Dunbar's animation provide some of the most beautiful scenery I've ever seen in an animated project . So with all that said , I highly recommend The Cunning Little Vixen .
454088	11228318	58586	10.0	A Shot in the Dark marked the introduction of Inspector Clouseau's regulars	With Steve Martin's Pink Panther 2 coming a few days away , I thought I'd look back at the previous entries in the movie series before I watched the latest one . I'm now on the second entry , A Shot in the Dark , that was originally a mystery play with different characters . For many , this was probably the true beginning of Inspector Jacques Clouseau's adventures since here is where we meet his regular supporting cast of characters of Commissioner Dreyfus ( Herbert Lom ) , his assistant Francois ( Andre Maranne ) , and house servant Kato-later Cato ( Burt Kwouk ) . Also Graham Stark , who's Clouseau's partner Hercule here , would subsequently play other roles later in the series . This time , Clouseau is defending maid Maria Gambrelli ( Elke Sommer ) against a murder charge . Among his suspects are George Sanders and Tracy Reed . This is also the first time Clouseau mispronounces some words to comic effect . With Peter Sellers having more scenes here than in The Pink Panther , he mines his physical shtick to most of what he's able to do with only one or two instances where a stuntman is needed . Gotta dig those scenes at the nudist colony where Clouseau his to hide his frontal part with a guitar ! Also liked seeing Dreyfus talking on the phone to a woman saying he loves her before being informed of his wife on the other line . " Tell her I'm out of town . " the commissioner exclaims . And Herbert Lom is really funny whenever his right eye blinks every time Clouseau is mentioned ! With no Pink Panther in the animated credits or his theme song playing , we get instead a short little man with mustache and trench coat with his own Henry Mancini theme whose presence causes such a stir with the preview audiences that DePatie-Freleng would start a second cartoon series called The Inspector not long after The Pink Panther animated series was already beginning . There's just so much that's hilarious here but I'll just recommend this to anyone who loves Sellers and his character or great movie slapstick comedy in particular . Next up , Inspector Clouseau . . .
454743	11228318	45315	10.0	Water , Water Every Hare is another fine Bugs Bunny cartoon from Chuck Jones	Six years after Hair-Raising Hare , Chuck Jones and Michael Maltese revisit the Bugs-encounters-an-evil scientist ( with neon letters saying " EVIL SCIENTIST " on his castle ) - and his pet monster premise with Water , Water Every Hare . In this one , instead of Peter Lorre , the scientist looks like Boris Karloff with green skin in an inside joke to his Frankinstein's Monster role . And the fully red-haired giant monster is named Rudolph here instead of Gossamer . This time , Karloff wants a brain for his giant robot so Bugs conveniently becomes the target . Of course , Bugs escapes both the scientist and Go . . . I mean , Rudolph and when ether makes everything go slow , Bugs escapes and then sleeps as the water that flooded his hole-in-the-ground takes him back there and as he wakes back up , he says , " Must have been a nightmare . " What happens after that brought big laughs from me ! This short was just as funny , maybe even more so , as HRH and , once again , I loved when Bugs turned into a gossip-chattering nail filer shooting the breeze with the fully red-haired monster who doesn't realize how crafty the rabbit really is . Most definitely recommended .
454217	11228318	1127385	10.0	The Pancake Batter Anomaly is one of the funniest episodes of " The Big Bang Theory " yet	When Penny returns from her hometown in Nebraska , she tells Leonard and Sheldon that many of her immediate family had the flu . That signals Sheldon to keep away from her since he's a germaphobic . When Sheldon does get sick , Leonard decides to ditch him to watch a Planet of the Apes marathon at a cinema with Howard and Raj . So , ironically , Penny ends up taking care of Sheldon by rubbing vapor rub on him and singing a song his mother warbled to him . After Leonard found out on his cell phone , he and his buddies sneak back in with an upset Penny waiting . . . This was one of the most hilarious episodes I've seen this season ! From Sheldon's various sickness reactions to Penny's flabbergasted indignities to Leonard , Howard , and Raj's shenanigans , this was such a top-notch outing ! And I loved Howard's quoting of the " dirty paws off my popcorn " line from the first Apes outing since I watched this a few weeks after the originator of that one , Charlton Heston , recently died . One more thing , Chuck Lorre made his 200th vanity card here and tells us . . . how lonely he is . He can't be too much so since he now has two hit TV shows in a row !
454971	11228318	1127390	10.0	The Coopeer-Hofstadter Polarization is a hilarious comeback for " The Big Bang Theory "	While Sheldon , Leonard , Howard , and Raj are being awestruck at the way they've used the internet to communicate with the world in order to turn on the lamp , stereo , and other electrical appliances , Leonard discovers a letter inviting him and Sheldon to share their scientific knowledge to an audience of fellow colleagues . Sheldon threw it away because he doesn't feel the need to share while Leonard decides to go and has Penny help with the wardrobe . Penny tries to patch things up with the two former buddies but inadvertently makes things worse . So with her , Howard , and Raj in the audience , Leonard presents his theories to a crowd of 25 before Sheldon reveals himself among them as they get into a knock-down fight in front of everyone . Suffice it to say , Howard sent his cell-phone version to YouTube which also accepted his same-place filming of him and a sleepy Penny with the caption of " his girlfriend " . We find out later that a couple of nerds in China have seen this and are also awestruck at their lamps turning on and off at will . . . With the strike finally over ( congrats to the writers for getting much of what they deserve ) , CBS presented an all-new Monday comedy lineup starting with this one in the middle of March . With this episode , " The Big Bang Theory " comes back funnier than ever ! Loved the references to Scanners whenever Sheldon tries to " blow " up Leonard's head . There's also a running joke told by Leonard that only Penny doesn't get . And how about those clothes Penny tries to discard or the model city of Kandor she discovers . All I can say is , bravo to CBS for renewing this very entertaining show for a second season . Oh , and loved Chuck Lorre's reference to producing two shows competing with a " deaf diva dancing her ( behind ) off " on his vanity card at the close !
453933	11228318	390981	10.0	Citizen King is essential viewing for anyone studying Dr . Martin Luther King	With today another celebration of the birth of Dr . Martin Luther King , I finally decided to watch the documentary made about his last five years that aired on " American Experience " that I taped four years ago . Following his Birmingham stint to his march in Washington , D . C . to his trips to the Johnson White House to his Nobel Peace Prize to his demonstrations in Chicago to protest poverty there to his opposition to the Vietnam War and his fallout with the President and finally to Memphis in support of the garbage strike there and his eventual assassination , we get compelling present-day testimony from many of his friends and colleagues like Andrew Young . Many news footage and home movies of Dr . King also abound to show how he presented himself publicly . While much of the current interviews still hold the reverend in high esteem , there's also some that mention his adultery and his occasional employment of Communists not to mention his not-so-cordial encounters with FBI chief J . Edgar Hoover . With all that I just mentioned , I'll just say that I highly recommend Citizen King .
454708	11228318	1248332	10.0	St . Valentine's Day was another hilarious episode of " 30 Rock "	What a hilarious episode of " 30 Rock " this one was especially considering the Vanentines Day theme ! Jack wants to take Elisa to his favorite dessert restaurant but has to go to a Catholic church with her first . Liz has a disastrous first date with her doctor neighbor which isn't helped when he also has to look out for his troubled teenage daughter and his mother is taking a turn for the worse . And , in a nod to Cyrano , Tracy pretends to be Kenneth when a blind woman Kenneth's smitten with proves too much for the page to communicate with verbally . I'll stop right there and just say how once again the barbs run fast and furious that I just couldn't stop laughing ! My favorite line was Liz ' when she said about Elisa , " If I had those knockers , I'd be thanking God , too ! " ( By the way , Tina's cleavage got a nice show-off here too ! ) Oh , and if the blind woman looked familiar , you've probably seen Forgetting Sarah Marshall since in that one , Jack McBrayer was on a honeymoon with the same woman that he's dating here : Maria Thayer . Once again , you rock , " 30 Rock " !
453993	11228318	20414	10.0	Walt Disney's The Skeleton Dance deserves its scary classic status	Just watched this classic Walt Disney Silly Symphony ( the first ) on the Saturday Morning Blog as linked from YouTube . This was a mostly funny and atmospheric cartoon that must have really made an impact on the movie industry since after this there were a lot of cartoons that involved things that bump in the night . Animated by Ub Iwerks with music by Carl Stalling , The Skeleton Dance has four of those creatures having fun scaring fur out of cats and an owl before swaying to and fro , tap dancing simultaneously , and one playing the other like a xylophone . The most shocking part for me was when another played a cat's tail like a violin ! Excellent stuff all around so if you're in a Halloween mood , I definitely recommend The Skeleton Dance .
454582	11228318	902012	10.0	Fallout is excellent end-of-the-year episode of Heroes	Peter is in the interrogation room questioned by FBI agent Audrey and mind-reading cop Matt . When Matt tries to read Peter's head , Peter ends up reading Matt's ending with a colliding block effect . Peter mentions that Claire , not the dead Jackie , was who Syler was after so Matt and Audrey leave to get her as Peter is left behind . Jessica hit Niki's ex-husband D . L . but the bullets went through him though Jess doesn't seem to know this yet ( she must have memory loss from when D . L put his hand through her previously ) . The next morning , D . L . and son Macah go to a cabin to settle down just before Niki comes nearby and sees her Jessica reflection on a puddle with Jessica saying how stronger she is for anyone , especially Niki , to take her on . Jess must have figured out by this time that D . L . was still alive and takes her gun and hides it as Micah finds her , thinking it's his mom , and takes her back to the cabin . As Micah calls to his dad , D . L . kicks the door open and attempts to knock out Jessica . Sometime after kicking down Micah , Niki comes back and turns herself in the the police . Back to the interrogation room , Claire is questioned with her father witnessing stopping short of revealing her powers since her dad doesn't want anyone else to know . Claire later stops by Peter's cell to tell him what a hero he is to her while her dad confronts Syler and calls him by his real name of Gabriel Gray . He later gets orders from above to keep Syler alive though Eden , with her powers of persuasion , mentions being able to make Syler kill himself without anyone being the wiser . Eden then visits Issac and gives him a cell phone and a card . Issac calls the number on the card and gets Hiro , still at the diner in Texas . They agree to meet at a bus station . At a nearby hotel room , Issac tries to paint without drugs for the first time as Hiro and Ando watch . The result is a scene of Hiro with a sword confronting a dinosaur . Hiro looks at that and says , " I gotta get me a sword . " Eden calls Mohinder in New York and confesses she lied to him , promising to tell him everything after she takes care of some business . She goes to Syler's cell and attempts to kill him , but he manages to break the glass between them and somehow quickly point the gun back at her instantly killing her . Before going home , Claire is assured by her dad that he'll take care to explain to her little brother about knowing her powers and is ordered to have the tapes Zack recorded of her to be destroyed . She does just that when Zack brings them , then goes to her brother who has no memory of the incident . Neither does Zack later on and he's now wondering why Claire is speaking to him since she's ignored him since sixth grade . Claire , now feeling alone , calls her dad who reassures her everything's all right . Just then his Haitian assistant , who was always silent previously , surprises Claire and reveals he's wiped certain memories of everyone she's been close to and was going to do the same to her but reneges this time . He only asks her , " Can you keep a secret ? " During this whole time , Peter has been having dreams or visions of his brother Nathan , Syler , and now of being back in New York with all the other heroes except his brother running away from him as he begins to explode . . . But wait , now he's back in present time feeling normal with Nathan embracing him and some of the others coming back . . . Wow , what a way to end the year before the month-long hiatus ! So Eden's now dead . Although I mentioned that Syler pointed the gun back at her , I now wonder did Eden purposely turn the gun around to keep him from getting her persuasion powers or did Syler manage to get some of Eden's powers before or after killing her ? When Matt shook hands with Claire's dad , he didn't recognize him but on a later stakeout he did recognize his Haitian assistant with him . So how long before he figures out that his mind's been wiped by the Haitian man ? And was Peter actually about to cause the bomb explosion or did he get close to that man who actually makes things burn sometime before ? I can't wait to find out all these things and more come January 22 , 2007 !
454100	11228318	853635	10.0	Heroes : Collision moves the series along briskly	One thing I forgot to mention from the last episode , Niki the stripper took her son Micah to his grandmother's house where the grandma believes her son , Niki's ex-husband , is innocent of the charges he is in jail for . In the beginning of this episode , we find Matt the cop , after passing out in the bar after witnessing a black man as the only one he couldn't read the mind of , strapped to a machine with that black man and Claire's dad watching over him . Claire's dad tells the black man to " dig deep " just as Matt asks , " Who's Claire ? " Hiro and Ando are in Las Vegas where Hiro reluctantly uses his stop-motion powers to help Ando win at gambling . Hiro eventually gets knocked out by some guards while Ando stands helplessly . Mohinder tries to warn politician Nathan about some future crisis but gets the brush-off . Because of this latest humiliation , he wants to go back to India but gets sucked backed in by Nate's brother Peter who brings Mohinder's father's book with him . Peter mentions his possible ability to siphon other people's powers to a skeptical Mohinder . Meanwhile , as Claire wakes in the morgue , she magically heals her skin and leaves without notice . Back at school , she encounters another girl who confides in her that the quarterback had done to her what Claire had just experienced as that quarterback appears before Claire's eyes and blatantly flirts with another girl . Claire takes that quarterback for a speedy ride hoping to get him to apologize for his behavior with her . No dice . She speeds up till they crash into a brick wall . Niki is at the Vagas hotel doing her job when she encounters Nathan who is on a trip . As they get to a room , Nathan mentions he's married with two sons which seems to make Niki resists his advances . After she leaves , Niki encounters someone who wants some payment his now-dead cohorts didn't get . It is in the elevator that Niki switches to a more aggressive personality and threatens this someone with her heel . She tells this someone to " leave our child alone " . She then comes back to Nathan's room and is recorded on camera as she makes love to him . Peter convinces Mohinder to come to painter Issac's apartment to see Peter siphon Issac's ability to paint the future but the artist is too into his work to even answer the doorbell . As they get back on the train , Mohinder again displays his skepticism as everything stops except Peter , then a Japanesse man from the future greets Peter and says , " I am from the future , it's nice to see you without your scar . " It is Hiro , speaking perfect English , with a katana and long hair and no glasses ! Okay , so this has just got more interesting ! I liked all the developments though like many others I did wonder why Mohinder suddenly seemed to do a 360 degree turn in his personality . Hope to see more of Greg Grunberg as Matt next week and that he still has some of his mind-reading abilities intact . Oh , and to Claire : You go , girl !
454826	11228318	123297	10.0	Thundering Fleas is the most hilarious silent " Our Gang " short yet	This Hal Roach comedy short , Thundering Fleas , is the fifty-first in the " Our Gang / Little Rascals " series . Inspired by her older sister's upcoming wedding , Mary stages a mock one with Joe as the groom . He refuses to kiss her since he doesn't want the gang to laugh at him , however . They indeed do when Mary does the deed on Joe's lips . After one of them throws a shoe to Joe's face causing a track there , they point to Farina ( who had nothing to do with it ) who gets chased by the tracked-faced boy with dog Magnolia in tow . After Joe stops , Farina and the dog encounter a flea circus with the star attraction-Garfield . That flea ( which is amusingly animated here ) lands on Magnolia and decides to reside there with the dog now scratching herself . Along the way , Farina encounters a new friend , Scooter , who says his father is the vice-president of the U . S . They drop a bowl of fish with the amphibians jumping up and down . Scooter's mom then shows and sends Farina on his way . Meanwhile , Garfield's owner offers the rest of the gang $1 for finding his star flea . At this point , the rest of the owner's fleas are set free as Garfield tells his friends to " come on up " on the dog . It all ends in a hilarious disaster of Mary's sister's wedding . . . This has to be the most hilarious of the silent " Our Gang " comedies I've seen yet ! Besides what I've just mentioned , there's plenty of now familiar faces of other Hal Roach comedies that provide additional pleasure starting with the up-and-coming Oliver Hardy as the cop who's the first victim of the fleas as he loses his trousers and paints his bright white long johns black to prevent further embarrassment , Charlie Hall as one of the wedding musicians , Charlie Chase with a big walrus mustache that hilariously moves from side-to-side , and James Finlayson without his usual prop mustache as the preacher reacting with his familiar fisheye reaction when the groom shakes his head as if to say " no " before the fleas then also lands on the preacher . Once again , kudos to the YouTube poster who added the familiar LeRoy Shield music from the " Little Rascals " talkies for providing the topper for this very enjoyable " Our Gang " entry , Thundering Fleas .
453994	11228318	146309	10.0	Thirteen Days was a fine dramatization of the Cuban Missile Crisis	Earlier this month I visited my sister in Maryland , to see her first-born child , a boy , get baptized . While there , her husband showed this historical drama to me , my mother , and my other brother-in-law . We were all enthralled at the drama of what happened over 40 years ago being played on the just-unwrapped DVD . Seeing Keven Costner , as White House consultant Kenny O'Donnell , speaking in the same accent and mannerisms of the Kennedy brothers Jack ( Bruce Greenwood ) and Bobby ( Steven Culp who I didn't recognize as the same actor that played Rex on " Desparate Housewives " ) made me almost forget his movie star magnetism . Also fine in their real-life roles were Dylan Baker as Robert McNamara and Michael Fairman as Adlai Stevenson . Director Roger Donaldson takes his time in depicting the title's events that , no matter what one knows of the outcome , still provides some suspenseful turns as well as also explaining how and why certain results became . I was especially impressed at how Culp as Bobby was seeming so impatient with the way Stevenson as a UN ambassador was slowly taking his time with the Soviet premier . Maybe Donaldson was a bit much with a couple of shots of the nuclear film footage inserted but overall , I'd say Thirteen Days was an excellent depiction of how close to World War III our country was during what must have been very tense days of October 1962 .
455190	11228318	141924	10.0	Another Classic Felix Cartoon	This is another Felix cartoon worth preserving that you can see on YouTube . It starts with a mouse about to walk a rope tied to a ship being chased by Felix . After they both get on , a sailor unties the rope leaving them stuck in ! As the ship sails , Felix gets seasick . The ship lands in Holland . Felix flirts with a human Dutch girl . Her boyfriend catches them and throws the cat out but not before Felix gets a pump from a nearby car and pumps the boy's pants up causing it to hoist the boy to the sky . Felix then takes a banjo and serenades the girl . It bothers a big man in a nearby house who throws a shoe that hits Felix's head . Felix uses the shoe as a boat and an exclamation point above his head as an oar ! He goes to the man's house and finds a bottle of milk he'd like to drink . The man tells him he can't have it unless he waters the plants . Before doing so , Felix accidentally backs unto a table of gin which knocks the gin into a water spray can ! The cat picks that spray can and sprays some flowers that keep asking for more . Then he sprays a tree trunk that gets drunk and starts staggering all over the place ! The man is furious at this and chases Felix all the way to a windmill . Felix dispatches his tail and uses it to spin the windmill fan which forces the man's clothes off and the man himself to blow away . Felix laughs as we iris out . It's easy to see why Felix was such a phenomenon during the ' 20s , since pre-Mickey Mouse there hadn't been such an animated character with such personality . By all means seek this one out !
454730	11228318	38060	10.0	The Screwy Truant is hilarious Tex Avery cartoon from MGM	When I was a kid watching the Tom and Jerry show on weekday afternoons in the late ' 70s and early ' 80s , I watched most of the cartoons they aired that was from the ' 40s including those starring Droopy or Barney Bear . For some reason , however , they never either showed or I never saw any Screwy Squirrel cartoons made during the same time . So The Screwy Truant is the very first one starring this admittedly unappealing , both visually and personality-wise , character I've ever seen . Despite that , I loved the " everything but the kitchen sink " ( actually , don't think too much about that one ) humor of the entire premise of the title character playing hooky and getting chased by the truant officer with all the fast-paced wackiness you can only expect from the one and only Tex Avery . Absolutely nothing is sacred , certainly not " Little Red Riding Hood " or jokes related to WWII air raid uniforms . So to anyone who loves great animation and great laughs , The Screwy Truant is for you !
454355	11228318	1055794	10.0	Dungeons & Dragons was another cool episode of " Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles "	This episode begins when the last one ended : With Charley attempting to fix Derek Reese who can't lay still because he thinks Cameron wants to harm him . We then see flash-forwards of the future he came from with Kyle , his brother and the father of John Connor with Sarah , and other rebels trying to avoid the Skynet machines that flash lights on them . We see them get captured and chained in an abandoned house and then somewhere down the road , Kyle disappears , presumably to where Sarah lived before John was born . . . Back in the present , Sarah tells Charley everything ( well , almost . He figures on his own Kyle's connection with John ) and while he doesn't understand , he accepts . He does think that Cameron , while hot on the outside , is a " very scary robot " on the inside as he sees her about to burn the exoskeleton of the Terminator from the last episode . We also once again see the part from his head that she puts in her pocket . What's up with that ? Back in Derek's flash-forward , he's encountering Cameron here who is also in the protect mode there but because of his harsh treatment by other machines immediately tries to shoot but is prevented so from a superior . After demanding a few times , he finally gets to see future John but he looks like his younger self . That's because by this point we flash back to the present with that John waking Derek up and telling him what a great hero his brother was without revealing his relation to him with respect to his mother . In the last flash-forward scene , Derek and his comrades are teleported to the present Los Angeles naked where the ruins they came from are replaced by the still-standing buildings from perhaps a time before any of them were even born . Oh , and before that , we find out that Andy Goode was chained with Derek and Derek actually killed him when he went to his room . With that , this episode ends . . . Another awesome episode with some cool gore scenes that lives up to the " Viewer Discretion Advised " warning that always appears in the beginning of this program . Compelling use of closeups and lighting for the future segments and good exposition dialogue between Charley and Sarah . By the way , Sarah looks particularly luminous in those close-ups . Is Cameron's mentioning of some machines " going bad " a foreshadowing of what is going to happen to her especially after getting some parts from the destroyed Terminator following her statement that " all parts must be destroyed " ? ( or was that Sarah that said that ? ) Oh well , since I don't want my head to keep on spinning ( or exploding ! ) , I'll just say Dungeons & Dragons was another excellent episode of " Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles " .
454448	11228318	697139	10.0	Midnight Express Special is an excellent episode of SCTV	On Sunrise Semester , Edith Prickly ( Andrea Martin ) plugs her passport photo business with her cousin ( Robin Duke ) the participant . Funniest scene is when Duke gets blown by a giant fan that probably wasn't necessary . Oh , and she's drunk the whole time ! On a Mamorex tape spot , Ella Fitzgerald ( Joe Flaherty ) is confused if Rickie Lee Jones ( Duke ) and Tom Waits ( Rick Moranis ) are live or on tape . On the Great White North , Bob McKenzie ( Moranis ) discusses the topic of whether to bowl while loaded . Brother Doug ( Dave Thomas ) seems to be saying no since his ball went over three lanes and he puked in the gutter to where the guy who fixed the pins got it . Doug then asks his brother to impersonate the " little guy " which Bob does a little embarrassingly . Next , Bill Needle ( Thomas ) comes on and complains about being limited to three seconds just as he's being grabbed off . Then SCTV President Guy Caballero ( Flaherty ) comes on and mentions a show from Turkey being aired on the network via satellite and needing $10 , 000 " per person " to keep such shows on the air . The show is " Midnight Express Special " hosted by Abbott ( Eugene Levy ) and Costello ( Tony Rosato ) in faux-wrinkled black and white footage mixed with recreations of the movie Midnight Express . Guests John Denver ( Moranis ) , Anne Murray ( Duke ) , and Randy Newman ( Thomas ) all get frisked by the Turkish guards . Abbott and Costello were also supposed to introduce The Band but Costello keeps getting them mixed up with The Who , Yes , and The Byrds . There was also a network promo for Today , Tomorrow and Yesterday . . . This is a very funny episode with the highlight being the " Who's On First " takeoff I just mentioned . Also loved Bob and Doug McKenzie who were the Wayne's World of the day , i . e . two characters who were very popular outside of the show . I watched this on SCTV : Best of the Early Years on DVD . Well worth the purchase .
453984	11228318	655448	10.0	Santa Claus gets hilarious riffing on " Mystery Science Theater 3000 "	Well , this one was even funnier than the Santa Claus Conquers the Martians episode of " MST3K " . Besides Santa , there's also Pitch the Devil ( loved Mike and the ' bots comments on his dancing , " He really seems to enjoy pantaloons too much ! " LOL ) , and Merlin the Magician . This being a Mexican production , the little girl is named Lupita and " Feliz Nadivad " is printed on the store window . There's a couple of good Holiday songs especially written for the show . Those white mechanical reindeer are some of the most creepiest I've ever seen in a movie and one of them has a really creepy laugh that gets laughed at in derision by the Satellite of Love gang . Oh , and there's also a bulldog that gets distracted by a doll cat that runs on skates ! " The Hot Wheels cat ! " LOL This was one weird movie that deserved all the catcalls by the " MST3K " gang . And it's from schlockmeister producer K . Gordon Murray . That info alone should warn you about this American-dubbed picture's quality . So for any die hard " MST3K " fans , Santa Claus is definitely recommended .
453794	11228318	1391622	10.0	Pussycat seems to be a unique claymation short by Takena Nagao	This clay animation short by a Japanese artist named Takena Nagao is filled with unsubtle sexuality ( but no nudity ) and plenty of gore involving the female title character in a tight dress , a business pig , and a stalker wolf . This guy Nagao seems to be the Quentin Tarantino of clay animation shorts ! There is another short of his on YouTube called Chainsaw Maid which also has plenty of gore that-because of the clay-is very comical to me . Unfortunately , this short that I'm reviewing now is the only one of Nagao's that's listed here on IMDb . So I'll just say if you love offbeat things involving animation , Pussycat should fit the bill . And one more thing , this short is definitely not for children !
