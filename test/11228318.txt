453735	11228318	151993	1.0	Plane Dumb features the worst in racial stereotyping	While credited as a Tom and Jerry cartoon , this is not the cat-and-mouse team but an earlier Mutt-and-Jeff rip-off featuring them going to Africa and disguising themselves in the stereotypical burnt cork makeup to try to blend in . While the dialect humor is mostly lame , there is a brief musical sequence involving " black skeletons " that was entertaining . I have to ask however , how could Tom and Jerry still have their makeup stay on even after being dumped in the water a couple of times ? One of many entries produced by the Van Beuren Corporation for distribution by RKO Radio Pictures before RKO made a deal with Disney . Only worth seeing if you're an animation buff or is interested in how certain ethnicities were stereotyped as entertainment way back when .
455045	11228318	32716	2.0	Little Lambkin was a way below average Max Fleischer Color Classic cartoon	Just watched this rare Max Fleischer Color Classic on YouTube . The title character is a toddler boy who-when his parents are temporarily away-loves to play with animal friends , a raccoon and a squirrel . Together they eat a whole watermelon . But this day , the boy has to move to the city where he has to deal with electrical appliances . In order to move back to his previous home , this toddler proceeds to switch many electrical plugs that makes a refrigerator into a stove , etc . . . I've just described most of the cartoon and I'm not very impressed with the results . The watermelon sequences in the beginning and end were amusing but the chaos with the switched plugs in the city kitchen was too ridiculous even for an animated cartoon . And the boy himself was too bratty for my tastes when he constantly cried about not wanting to move . So unless you're a Max Fleischer completist , I wouldn't recommend Little Lambkin .
453920	11228318	141034	2.0	Felix Minds the Kid is uninspiring	Felix Minds the Kid starts with the cat coming to the fish market trying to get some food . The fish manager throws him out saying , " I'll give you the devil if you come back here ! " Felix goes to a nearby barrel that says " fresh today " . He uses his tail to get whatever is in the barrel and gets bitten by a crab ! The crab is still literally on his tail as Felix walks through a thin log that causes the crab to get stuck . Felix then goes to a nearby house where he encounters a baby carriage and a shoe . As he attempts to eat the shoe , he hears a baby crying in the house as his father blows a trumpet to cheer him up . As the trumpet blows , three toy soldiers are now marching in step . The baby resumes crying after the father stops playing . Felix hears and offers his services . The father says , " If you watch my kid for an hour , I'll give you some feed . " He leaves as Felix tries to cheer the kid by bouncing a ball on his tail . The baby laughs after one of the toy soldiers hits Felix on the tail with his rifle ! Felix then blows a balloon , gives it to the baby who sucks its air and becomes inflatable floating away from the house ! Felix chases inflatable baby with carriage to a building with a pole . As baby hangs to pole , a crow comes to baby and pops him back to normal ! Baby cries and lands back in carriage as Felix takes him to a nursery . He then goes off to get a candy cane as baby gets invited to come in nursery by another baby . As Felix gets candy cane , he finds carriage missing baby and goes back to house to find father seething mad and saying , " If that cat doesn't get my kid back in five minutes , I'll skin him alive ! " Felix , thinking about this , hurries back to nursery to find lots of babies looking alike ! He then attempts to get father's baby by using candy cane to lure him out . Baby comes out and then tells fellow nursery mates to follow him . They do as Felix leads not noticing crowd . As the father sees the various babies coming he faints as Felix turns around , sees the big crowd of kids , and changes his cane into a floating umbrella as we iris out . This short doesn't have too many gags and I found myself bored watching it . Go watch if you're a Felix completist , otherwise skip it .
454995	11228318	146965	2.0	Kisser Plant is a weird and boring Terrytoons short	Kisser Plant is a Terrytoons short starring Oscar , a human , and Astro Nut , a space creature . The title character is a gift from Astro Nut after Oscar tells him about wanting something for his garden . Problem is , the plant grows as big as a bean stalk and loves to kiss constantly including policemen and soldiers ! This is one weird cartoon that , unfortunately , doesn't provide any laughs , just repetition of the plant kissing everything in sight . And the ending can be predicted by anyone who's seen various other cartoons on Saturday morning or on the weekday afternoons in past decades before talk shows took over . Only recommended for anyone who feels a need to see all Terrytoons .
454829	11228318	233371	3.0	The version I saw of Boys Will Be Joys was abridged to one reel	This Hal Roach comedy short , Boys Will Be Joys , is the forty-second in the " Our Gang / Little Rascals " series . The version I saw was on Goodtimes ' VHS of " Our Gang Comedy Festival II " . It was a shortened one-reel version of an originally two-reel film . And since this version was handled by a company other than the original Hal Roach Studios or their distributor Pathe Exchange , the series title was " Those Lovable Scallawags with Their Gangs " with the episode title being " Carnival Time " . With the original H . M . Walker inter-titles removed , here's the synopsis , in my own words , I partly got from the definitive book on the " Our Gang / Little Rascals " series by Leonard Maltin and Richard W . Bann : While the gang has plans for a new amusement park in an acre of their choosing , the surveyor tells them it's being used for a future factory . Undeterred , they see the sixty-year-old president of the land-owning company who has the heart of a ten-year-old . After hearing the gang's story , he decides to make their dream come true and walks out on his own meeting ! The board of directors follow him hoping to get the chairman to agree to get him voted off . In the end , with the kids and some of the men helping in operating the makeshift rides , the president tells the board he's retiring and vows to think as young as the gang are . . . Not very amusing and the rides seem not to convincing as simply the creation of the kids-even with the financier's fun-loving aid . There is an interesting angle of a fluidly moving shot of a boy going backwards on a slide in a wheel-less vehicle that was partly fascinating . I was also amused by Farina's displaying of a " Wild Animal " in his tent-which turns out to be a skunk . Otherwise , Boys Will Be Joys was just an average " Our Gang " short .
454319	11228318	26150	3.0	Buddy of the Legion is another bland effort of a cartoon starring Buddy	Here's another cartoon starring Warner's blandest character : Buddy . In this one , Buddy gets hired to take care of a bookstore while the heavyset female boss leaves temporarily . When he looks at a book about the Foreign Legion , Buddy dreams he's there . . . Despite some good animation provided by Bob Clampett and Chuck Jones , this animated short feels rushed because of the limited running time of six minutes that doesn't serve whatever story you half expect when Buddy dreams of adventure while sleeping . And the time spent having the boy dusting in the bookstore isn't all that amusing . So on that note , I'd only recommend Buddy of the Legion if you're a Warner Bros . cartoon completist .
453750	11228318	654739	3.0	My Little Margie : Miss Whoozis is too silly to recommended	Margie is a model whose photographer keeps forgetting her name . The modeling agency she works for has her father , Vern , and his boss , Honeywell , as investors though she doesn't know that nor does her father know his daughter's whereabouts . The designer wants all his models signed to exclusive contracts but Margie , who has a crush on the photographer , works at the dept . store window with fellow model Hercules in order to make photographer jealous . A big mix-up between the designer , photographer , Vern and his boss , and Margie results . One of several episodes filmed without a laugh track , the plot contrivances really show through . So this is a mildly amusing story at best though Fritz Feld as a designer does do his trademark ' pop ' sound from his mouth in his last scene . Too silly to really recommend though an interesting curio for Feld fans .
455184	11228318	779176	3.0	Meet Corliss Archer : The Vase That Came for Dinner is only slightly amusing	Mrs . Archer buys a vase that her husband is not too crazy about but he tolerates it . Next door neighbor teen Dexter suggests to Mr . Archer to use a plant to make vase less noticeable . Mr . Archer breaks vase . Dexter uses glue to hold vase together . He accidentally pours glue on duck Mr . Archer is cooking for dinner . After accidentally breaking vase again , Mr . Archer buys another one which we later find out has several copies available . During dinner , everyone is enjoying their duck except Mr . Archer whose food is sticking on his hands and in his mouth ! Meanwhile , Dexter's mother keeps getting different copies of the same statue from first her husband , then Corliss , then Mrs . Archer , and then Dexter . She puts one on a table and hides the other ones in the closet . Husband breaks the table one without wife noticing and goes to son Dexter to glue it together . Wife comes and discovers the broken vase and goes to her closet to replace it . Because father had been forgetting things lately , Dexter thinks he's crazy after finding vase fixed . He then thinks everyone else is such when after confessing buying the vase for his mom , his father , Mrs . Archer , and Corliss say the same thing ! It all clears up after Dexter opens closet and accidentally removes shelf . . . This is a silly and amusing episode , at least during the duck dinner . It gets a little bland and boring by the end . So it may be interesting to those who like ' 50s sitcoms . Otherwise avoid .
454083	11228318	23852	4.0	Buddy's Day Out marks the start of a series of cartoons starring a forgotten Warner Bros . character	I just watched on DailyMotion this cartoon short from Leon Schlesinger Productions whose product was distributed by Warner Bros . It marked the first appearance of a character named Buddy . Who ? You ask . Well , when Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising left to go to M-G-M , they took Bosko with them . So Schlesinger raided the Walt Disney studio for animators and the character they created to replace Bosko was Buddy who was basically Bosko in whiteface with girlfriend Cookie , pet dog Happy , and little brother Elmer . With that all said , this cartoon has some amusing sight gags like a car going back through a fence and crashing into various animals before landing in Cookie's yard or a train that seems on its way into crashing into a car with Elmer and Happy inside when Buddy and Cookie use a ladder to derail the locomotive in another direction . Otherwise , there is some cringe-worthy spots of some little animals and insects saying , " Woogie , woogie , woogie " or variations thereof that makes the cuteness factor here really annoying . So on that note , I'd recommend Buddy's Day Out only for those really curious of what the Looney Tunes gang had to go through to eventually get to the greatness of Porky Pig , Daffy Duck , Bugs Bunny , etc .
454187	11228318	141015	4.0	Felix Dopes It Out was my first not-so-impressive exposure to the famous cat	In Felix Dopes It Out , a man with a red nose gets a cigarette lit on it by the man next to him , has one fly say to the other on his head to stay from that nose , and gets rejected by a pretty woman for marriage because of it as Felix laughs at it all . When the man pulls a gun to his head , however , Felix promises to help him find a cure . So he takes a boat to Boola-Boola where at sea he encounters a shark . The shark jumps above the cat constantly as it seems to want to eat him . Just then , a box of garlic appears next to Felix's boat . Felix eats some which repels the shark leaving Felix sailing alone . Sometime after , the cat gets thrown a great distance to the island where he gets chased by a chef who magically changes his menu from Fish to Cat . Felix eludes him when he reaches the island leader who's sleeping as Felix goes to the safe to get the red nose antidote . As he leaves , a snake comes by but is subdued when the cat gets a flute , puts it on the sleeping man's lips , and it plays some soothing music . Back to where the red-nosed man is , the man reads the note which says , " Cure for the red nose . Keep drinking until it turns blue " This angers him as he chases Felix and we iris out . . . I remember seeing this about 20 years ago on a VHS cassette that had some public domain cartoons . This was the very first Felix short I've ever seen and I have to admit , I wasn't very impressed . Even today , the gags are only slightly amusing and only once or twice does Felix use his tail to detach for something ( in this one , he uses it to plug a hole the shark made in his boat ) . And much of the middle section is weak . Still , worth a look once for anyone curious about the first real cartoon superstar in animated history .
454482	11228318	30380	4.0	Little ol ' Bosko in Bagdad is awash in some stereotypes	I had previously reviewed The Old Mill Pond which , in my mind , caricatured many African-American musicians in a mostly flattering light . In this cartoon , Bosko ( who's here redrawn as a realistic-looking black kid instead of the monkey-looking one from Warner Bros . ) is tempted in a dream by a Louis Armstrong-like giant frog , complete with trumpet , to give him and his many palace co-worker servants a bag of cookies meant for Bosko's grandma . Those servants include caricatures of Stepin Fetchit , Bill " Bojangles " Robinson , and , as Armstrong's cohort here , Fats Waller with his piano . Love the tap-dancing animation between Bojangles and Bosko and much of the singing , but , as with The Old Mill Pond , the Fetchit character is offensive and annoying as is Robinson almost successfully tempting to trade Bosko's cookies with watermelon . Good thing Bosko refused ! And the Armstrong-Waller buffoonery is too close to stereotypical to be funny . Worth a look , however , for what MGM cartoons were like before the arrival of Tom and Jerry and Tex Avery . . .
454107	11228318	449088	5.0	At World's End was a pretty enjoyable POTC film despite having missed the first two	Having just seen Knocked Up and Waitress in another theatre earlier in the day , a friend called me up about 15 minutes later at home and proposed seeing one with him . We went back and forth over some titles when he reluctantly picked Knocked Up ( he thought I was at work earlier and I didn't tell him I watched some movies and one of his choices , Delta Farce , was in another theatre that wasn't near him ) . When we arrived at his neighborhood cinema , however , I asked if he enjoyed Pirates of the Caribbean : At World's End the night before with his nephew . He said he did and asked if I was willing to switch to that . I did since I didn't want to see KU again so soon . Now , having not seen the previous two installments and having fallen asleep during some of the movie , I was a little confused at what was going on but by the fight scenes in the final 15 or so minutes , I was genuinely thrilled by many of the action set pieces . As the new pirate king , Keira Knightly delivered a very rousing speech to her new crew . Orlando Bloom certainly proved very sexy and romantic next to her . Seeing multiple Johnny Depps and having a dialogue with his father ( and his character's inspiration ) Keith Richards provided some of the movie's many amusing moments . I may now have to see the first two POTC films and this one again to really understand what was going on but I must say , I still didn't have a bad time watching this one .
454066	11228318	71548	5.0	TV movie Get Christie Love ! is interesting for historical purposes	Based on the book , " The Ledger " , Get Christie Love was the first time a black female portrayed a detective on network TV . Teresa Graves is adequately compelling as the cop with some attitude whose superior , Captain Reardon ( Harry Guardino ) , has a major open flirtation with her that she seems to occasionally encourage . The main plot concerns the search of a drug dealer's ledger through the interrogation of the wife in order to bring him down . Despite some fight scenes and car chases that attract some attention , the pace seemed mostly dreary and I almost fell asleep before the end . The most interesting discovery for me , however , was the appearance of Ron Rifkin as a serial killer of prostitutes named Normand whom Christie catches in the beginning when she dresses as one . Rifkin would , nearly three decades later , play Sloane on one of the most exciting action series ever-Alias . Compared to that show , this TV movie that later became a series doesn't have as exciting fight scenes but I guess network censorship was more stricter then . Worth a look for historical purposes .
453965	11228318	22716	5.0	Bosko's Woodland Daze is slightly less entertaining than other Boskos	This Bosko short meanders a little more than usual compared to many of the other shorts in the series as it begins with him and his dog Bruno playing Hide and Seek . Bosko then dreams he's with elves along with a giant and a giant piano that he easily plays with his hands and feet ! There's also some princesses in flowers that sings some chorus lines and some other musical interludes before Bruno wakes up his master and the short ends . Not as entertaining as many others but still worth it for the animation and some of the climax . Wish YouTube had presented a better print . As Bosko says at the end with a dog ( early Bruno ? ) barking , " That's all , folks ! "
454061	11228318	161338	5.0	The Busy Bee is a Terrytoons short from the ' 30s	As many insects happily go to work , a working bee sings and declares his love for a butterfly . A spider from a tree above who's jealous of the bee takes the butterfly and kidnaps her to a wooden place that he surrounds with his web . The bee gets help in rescuing his girlfriend from some horseradish flies ( which are horses with wings ) and the firebugs who ride the flies to the spider's lair and light his web on fire as the bee and butterfly sing like Nelson Eddy and Jennette McDonald for the conclusion . . . This Terrytoons black-and-white short shows its operatic roots that may be charming or not depending on your music tastes . Otherwise , The Busy Bee is worth a look for any animation fan especially one who's a fan of Paul Terry .
453887	11228318	17544	6.0	When the Midnight Choo-Choo Leaves for Alabam ' is interesting early sound Song Cartune	The version of this Max Fleischer Song Cartune I saw on Google Video ended when the song did so there was no final gag animation that I'm used to seeing on others made during the ' 30s . The only animation I saw here was when the conductor said , " All aboard ! " with a long line of passengers quickly filing in . Then one late passenger opens the conductor like a door before the song starts . I'm guessing the recording used during this pre-Jazz Singer short was the actual recording played in some theatres that were getting wired for sound for this and other experimental sound Song Cartunes Fleischer was making at the time . The synchronization with the singer and the bouncing ball is not perfect but I guess since this was indeed an experimental undertaking that can be excused . Certainly worth seeing once for any Fleischer completists out there .
454544	11228318	654740	6.0	My Little Margie : Missing Link should be amusing for early ' 50s sitcom fans	Margie goes to her father's loan company to borrow some money so she can invest wisely . She then accidentally buys a wrestler ! Vern , her father , is not too thrilled with Margie's investment . The wrestler threatens anyone who gets angry with ( her father ) or kisses ( boyfriend Freddie ) Margie . He later reveals to father he lets anyone who tells sob story to him win . Vern goes to wrestler's opponent and tells him what he just heard . That opponent tells his own sob story in ring but then Margie kisses him and wrestler throws him out into the audience where Vern is setting ! There's some other plot points in this episode but I'll let you find out for yourself . This is another silly but amusing story by the show's writers that should be funny enough for those that like this sort of thing . If you like what I just described and is interested in what filmed sitcoms were like in the 1950s , this show is certainly worth a look .
454867	11228318	151770	6.0	No Place Like Rome is another one of those sing-a-long cartoons Famous Studios is known for	This was a Famous Studios Song Kartune ( though this version has the Harveytoons logo ) that I just watched on YouTube . It all takes place in Italy with various amusing gags concerning the country's shape ( the obvious boot and foot one ) , the Leaning Tower of Pisa ( where people going in come out in a different position ) , abstract modern painting , spaghetti eating , and a singer trying to break a wine glass ( which results in all the other window glasses broken instead ) . It's here that he tells us to " Follow the bouncing ball " as the song , " Oh , Ma , Ma , ( The Butcher Song ) " is played . After that , a train carrying a just married couple comes through a long tunnel . You can probably guess the punchline for that one . . . I didn't find myself laughing out loud at this one but I was fascinated by the gags just the same . No Place Like Rome is worth seeking out for anyone that loves animation especially for those Famous Studios completists out there .
454182	11228318	4189	6.0	Kid Auto Races in Venice is interesting first look at Chaplin's Tramp character	Kid Auto Races in Venice is historical in that it marks Charlie Chaplin's first appearance as The Tramp . In this short film , The Tramp is a spectator in a soap box derby race that is being filmed . Throughout the short , Charlie keeps getting in front of the camera and getting pushed off by either the cameraman or other spectators . In addition , he almost gets knocked off by some of the kid racers ! Obviously not much to mention of the plot of this six minute short but for some reason I was constantly amused by Chaplin's constant wandering in and out of the path of where the race cars were going as well as the cameraman's attempts to get him out of the way . Worth a look for film history buffs and the easily amused .
454583	11228318	34913	6.0	Japoteurs is another World War II era Superman cartoon	Despite some racism , Japoteurs is another pretty good Superman cartoon . Clark and Lois are invited to inspect a new bomber . A Japanese spy has stowed away in one of the bombs . Lois , having stayed on after everyone left , informs the control tower . The enemy spy manages to sabotage opponent by bombing it . Clark turns into Superman and quickly manages to save Lois from being ejected before defeating spy after spy destroys instrument panel . Supes then flies Lois to safety before going to plane's head and slowing its rough landing ( just like he did in the recent Superman Returns ) . All is well in the world again as Clark and Lois ride on an amusement park plane . . . Like I said , the pidgin English spoken by the Japanese spy borders on the offensive but worth a look for anyone interested in World War II propaganda . Or for anyone interested in all things Superman .
454817	11228318	1055413	6.0	Third episode of " Back to You " is funny if bland	Marsh mentions in his sports segment that a Steelers player had spent some time with a model . He then mentions that he'd like to switch places with one of them for 3 hours . He then says he meant with the football player . Chuck goes to a restaurant that happens to already have seated Kelly and daughter Gracie . Gracie invites Chuck to sit with them which becomes awkward with Kelly but fun for Gracie . Montana's less than enthusiastic performance on air was the result of her breakup with the player Marsh mentioned so news director Ryan , who has a crush on her , tries to cheer her up before the next newscast . And Marsh tries to prepare Gary for a weekend anchor spot . . . Many funny moments happen from the synopsis I just described like an audition tape of Gary's that's pretty cheesy or Marsh's failing attempts to get a more than lethargic audition performance from him . There's also some sweet moments from Ryan and Montana . As for the restaurant performance between Chuck , Kelly , and Gracie . . . well , I loved the drinking game between Gracie and Chuck but it was mostly blah otherwise . Still , I'm willing to give this show a pass since I've always loved Kelsey Grammar from all the years as Fraiser Crane . Now if only the ratings could improve from fourth place on Fox . . .
454252	11228318	53241	6.0	This original version of the Mexican Santa Claus movie is not bad despite some obvious flaws	Last year about this time , I reviewed the U . S . - dubbed version of this Mexican-made holiday movie as shown and commented on by Mike and the ' bots on " Mystery Science Theater 3000 " . I remember thinking it was hilarious and give it 10 stars because of all the commenting by them . I've now seen the original version from its native country and I've got to say that despite the still creepy laughs from both Santa and especially his mechanical reindeer , that prancing devil , that machine with the red lips , and all those children from different countries illegally in labor under the red-suited man , this is a mostly touching tale of the wishes of a rich boy and a poor girl coming true because of Santa . With both the native language intact ( and the version I saw on YouTube also had no subtitles ) , and no edits for commercials , this wasn't a bad movie to watch during this holiday season . I did admit , however , to laughing at some wrong places simply because of my memory of " MST3K " or doing so because some scenes were so obviously broad that you're giggling not because it's naturally funny but because you know they want you to laugh so you do . I mean , who wouldn't laugh at the devil getting his butt shot at with an arrow ? So for all the reasons I cited , I'm giving this version of the Mexican Santa Claus a 6 .
455040	11228318	24547	6.0	The Shanty Where Santy Claus Lives is enjoyable Merrie Melodies cartoon	This Hugh Harmon-Rudy Ising Merrie Melodies cartoon short produced by Leon Schlesinger for Warner Bros . tells the story of a poor boy who gets invited by Santa to go with him to his shanty to watch all the toys come to life . That's basically the plot of the story with some unfortunate blackface stereotypes in some scenes . Still mostly enjoyable with some entertaining musical sequences like the title song and a Kate Smith doll singing , " Shine on Harvest Moon " . It was during this period that the Merrie Melodies shorts ' purpose was to showcase a song that was published by the Warner Bros . publisher in each short with the showcased song's title the name of the film . That's the case here . Recommended for anyone who are Warner cartoon completists .
454056	11228318	492956	6.0	The Game Plan is a pretty good Disney family comedy for fans of The Rock	When I first saw the preview of The Rock in this formula Disney movie meant to attract families , I sorta cringed . My friend , on the other hand , who loves wrestlers and Disney stuff was very excited to see this one . So it was that we both decided to see this one after playing for several weeks . While watching during many parts of the first hour , I did feel a little wincing during many of the cutesy scenes between the lead character and the little girl who reveals herself as his daughter and thought many of the slapstick scenes were so obvious . But as the story went on and many entertaining set pieces like The Rock and the girl doing ballet in front of nearly all of his teammates , his singing his idol Elvis ' " Are You Lonesome Tonight ? " to her , or his teammates with the little girl playing super soaker with him were coming on , I was thoroughly enjoying myself to the point that I was thinking , " Hey , this is not so bad at all ! " So on that note , for anyone with families or who just want a good clean comedy , I highly recommended The Game Plan ! With sportscaster Marv Albert and Kyra Sedgwick who's a little amusing as The Rock's agent .
454981	11228318	512028	6.0	Society Party is another amusing episode of " Amos ' n ' Andy "	Sapphire wants a new dress for the party she and husband George " Kingfish " Stevens are invited to . The Kingfish gets it with the money he got selling his wife's fur coat to Andy for his girlfriend . Sapphire knew nothing about this and asks for the coat to go with the new dress . " Holy Mackerel ! " exclaims the Kingfish . . . This was more amusing that hilarious though I did like a later scene of Algonquin , who Andy's girlfriend had never seen before , attempting to rob the coat from her with Andy's knowledge and getting a hit on the head after revealing his " gun " as his finger ! Then there's a twist at the end that I won't reveal here . Like I said , this was a pretty amusing " Amos ' n ' Andy " episode .
454390	11228318	477347	6.0	Night at the Museum is an amusing enough family film	On Martin Luther King Day ( which this year actually fell on his birthday , January 15 ) , my friend and I , both on our off day , took in a matinée show of this Ben Stiller movie that had been No . 1 at the box office for the last three weeks . My friend had also wanted to take his nephew but the nephew had already seen it and he rarely sees something more than once . We both enjoyed it though I have to admit it does get a little silly some in the night museum scenes with nary any real laughs . The funnest lines and performance comes from Mickey Rooney when we first see him and he gives Stiller an attitude on his first day as a night watchman . There's also some funny slapstick scenes involving Stiller even before he gets his new job . Surprisingly , the same can't be said about Dick Van Dyke , usually known for his physical antics though it was nice to see him and Rooney together again since The Comic in 1969 . Also pretty good were Owen Wilson , Ricky Gervais , and as Teddy Roosevelt , Robin Williams , more subdued than usual . Also appearing were Kim Raver from " 24 " and " The Nine " playing Ben's ex-wife and the stunning Carla Gugino as the museum tour guide who seemed like a possible love interest for Stiller ( maybe that would be explored more if there were a sequel ) . So , in summation , I found the beginning pretty funny , the middle uneven , and the end mostly enjoyable with a pretty good mix of laughs , heart , and wonderment that the whole family can enjoy . And stay for some of the closing credits for some wonderful extra scenes with Rooney , Van Dyke , and Bill Cobbs . Also look for Stiller's mom , Anne Meara , as a woman trying to get Ben a job .
454016	11228318	910956	6.0	This Charming Couple provides an interesting look at a divorced couple's early courtship	This was an educational short from the McGraw-Hill Company about a couple about to divorce as we flashback to their courtship as a young couple just enjoying themselves in the forest without a care in the world . He-Ken-is an aspiring novelist who teaches literature in college . She-Winnie-is an assistant to a dean who thinks her fiancée will be famous which might make her life more exciting . While they're attractive and seem to get along well , neither believes in compromise . In fact , Winnie thinks Ken's friends are snobs while Ken wonders if he can live up to his wife's ambitions of him . We also hear views-via voice-over-from Winnie's roommate and one of Ken's students of each , respectively . And Ken also has a hobby of recording folk artists in their natural environment such as an elder woman singer in the forest that brings to mind the real-life Alan Lomax who did such things . Then there's the marriage at the end that the narrator tells of why it's doomed when he emphasizes the personality differences between them . Perhaps a little dated because of the way it's filmed and scored but This Charming Couple does provide some insights of why not all marriages live " happily ever after " . Oh , and as a Louisiana resident , I have to note that " Ken " is from New Orleans . To anyone wanting to seek this out , This Charming Couple is on the Internet Archive site .
454307	11228318	2851	6.0	Fatty Joins the Force has some amusing slapstick touches	Before I begin the review , I'd like to note that Dot Farley plays Fatty's wife here and that Edgar Kennedy played a cop in the beginning of this short . I'm noting this because Farley and Kennedy would later team up in a series of shorts for RKO in the forties in which Dot would portray Edgar's mother-in-law . With that out of the way , let me say this was a pretty amusing short in which Fatty joins the police force after saving the commissioner's pre-teen daughter from drowning in a lake . Now in uniform , he finds he's not so respected when he runs afoul of some teen boys who hit him on the face with mud pies and then take his clothes off when he goes for a swim . Cops find his uniform and think he is dead while Fatty , in just long underwear , attracts unwanted attention from ladies who call for help to other cops who arrest him . It all goes downhill from there . . . Pretty amusing slapstick involving the teen boys , other policemen , and subsequent humiliation from his " mourners " . Old hat today but worth a look for silent movie comedy fans .
455084	11228318	64002	6.0	Arthur Penn's Alice's Restaurant is a product of its time	Alice's Restaurant is a time capsule of the attitudes of young people during the late ' 60s as experienced by folk singer Arlo Guthrie and his friends like the married couple Ray and Alice Brock , played here by James Broderick ( Mathew Broderick's father ) and Pat Quinn . Very much of its time , Arthur Penn's film tries to mix the humorous with the dramatic with uneven results . Some of the most touching scenes are those of Arlo with his father , folk singer Woody Guthrie ( played here by Joseph Boley ) and those of Ray and Alice after the drug death of a friend . There's also a nice musical duet with Woody's friend Pete Seeger and Arlo in Woody's hospital room . The most funny scene was the one concerning Arlo's attempts to get more urine for the draft board . Look for Shelley Plimpton , who had married Keith Carradine and gave him a daughter , actress Martha Plimpton , as Reenie who is a 15-year old girl who tries to seduce Arlo and M . Emmett Walsh as a Group W sergeant . Though nominated for Best Picture of 1969 , Alice's Restaurant seems dated now . Ray and Alice's remarriage at the end and the followup makes this one of the most bittersweet movies I've ever seen . . .
453875	11228318	224412	6.0	Hiroshima Maiden is subtle family drama about a serious subject	In 1955 , an American family takes in a female teenage survivor of Hiroshima . Of the two male children , the adolescent older one is hesitant at first to greet her especially having previously played war games with his treehouse friends with the Japanese , whom they referred to as Japs , as the enemy . Johnny , the older son , tries to satisfy the curiously of himself and his friends by switching light off to see if Miyeko , the Hiroshima girl , glows in the dark , and attempts to take a picture of her to show them . Miyeko shows Johnny her pre-Hiroshima pic and her paper birds that she wants to make thousands of to remind people of the children of Hiroshima . Miyeko is in America for surgery of her half-burned face she suffered during bombing . Because this is a family drama with only a running time of 58 minutes , the prejudices that result with Miyeko's arrival is subtle but effective . Some goes for the performances though Richard Masur ( Johnny's dad Jim Bennett ) and Dennis Haskins ( bigoted neighbor Hal Latimer ) have an almost intense scene near the end . A previous reviewer mentioned what some of the players have done since this film , so I'll say that Stephen Dorff ( Johnny ) has recently been in Oliver Stone's World Trade Center and Haskins shortly after this became better known as Principal Belding in " Good Morning , Miss Bliss " and " Saved by the Bell " . And Tamyln Tomita ( Miyeko ) was in The Day after Tomorrow . I bought a DVD of Hiroshima Maiden at a church fair for $1 last Sunday because the subject matter interested me . Recommended for anyone interested in World War II history and its aftermath .
455225	11228318	64332	6.0	Fistic Mystic provides some amusement for the last Looney Tunes cartoon on a regular production schedule	Just watched on YouTube this cartoon that , according to IMDb , is the last Warner Bros . Looney Tune one from the series that began with the very first WB animated short , Sinkin ' in the Bathtub , in 1930 . This is a Merlin the Magic Mouse one with Larry Storch providing the voices of him and his sidekick , Second Banana . They're in a western town whose population is reduced by 2 ( as seen on the town sign when the numbers change ) after the bad guy shoots them ( off screen , of course ) . After a couple of scenes where Merlin " defeats " this bad guy , he has Second Banana challenge him to a boxing match . To ensure victory , Merlin provides some magic gloves . . . Director Bob McKimson provides some pretty good timed punches to the bad guy that gave me some chuckles when I watched this . So while the animation is not the greatest , there still are some good movements and poses for whatever limited means the animators had at their disposal . So on that note , Fistic Mystic is worth a look . P . S . The Bill Lava version of " The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down " that appeared in most of these ' 60s Warner cartoons is a bit different here and , also according to IMDb , was only used in this particular cartoon .
453751	11228318	860289	7.0	Vanished : Resurrection marks Gale Harold's final episode	Last week , there were blood stains on the wall of the cabin where we found Sara Collins held prisoner inside . As the investigation continues , enough evidence is discovered to confirm that Senator Jeffrey Collins ' wife is dead . Only the senator's family knows this information . After the breakup with the cameraman , reporter Judy Nash crashes in the apartment of an old flame and spends the night there . Kelton attends his daughter's communion with his ex-wife where he hears someone contact him confidential info that causes him to rush out of church . This was after he went on national television with the ID of the license plate of Sara's abductors . This gets him in trouble with his superior . When Kelton arrives in D . C . , he meets with the man who was Judy's flame and gets told he might be removed from the case . With his wife now dead , Senator Collins goes to the confirmation hearings with the intent to vote no . At this point , Lin Mei finds that the blood in the cabin was made to look like a violent struggle took place between Sara and her kidnappers . In other words , Sara is still alive ! After Kelton hears this , he rushes to the court before Collins can cast his vote . Through his FBI contact , he manages to fake a virus alert before the final vote from the senator is recorded . With the senator out of the building with everyone else , Kelton reports to him about his wife's survival and tries to tell him something else just as he gets shot and lays dead , blood now surrounding him . . . So we begin with one death that turns out to be faked and end with another death that is all but confirmed visually . This marks the last episode for the show's star Gale Harold after the first 7 . Eddie Cibrian who appeared as Nash's old flame will take over after three weeks . Campared with the others , this one episode doesn't have too many subplots to confuse the viewer with the connections to the Missing Sara case . Certainly the little girl's communion was a nice break to the how - can - we - keep - the - viewers - on - edge - angles of previous episodes . Having liked Cibrian on the much-missed Invasion last season , here's hoping he brings Vanished a much needed shot in the arm !
455100	11228318	403064	7.0	Getting There has an abstract-style imagination	A man is looking at a picture of a tropical island . He imagines himself going to the box office and buying a ticket for a bus , a train , and a plane as means to get there . None of them suit him , especially the plane . Instead , he strips to his full-bodied swimwear , leaves his regular clothes at the box office , and enters the picture he's been looking at as he relaxes tubing near the picture island ! The end . This is a very brief short entry from the Volume 5 collection of The International Tournee of Animation . Canadian Paul Dreissen does an interesting abstract version of imagination in depicting a man's ideal vacation . Worth a look for animation fans .
454356	11228318	422881	7.0	This Japanese cartoon I found on Cartoon Brew linking YouTube was pretty fascinating for its views on America and Mickey Mouse in particular	This is a bizarre cartoon from ' 30s Japan I just discovered on YouTube as linked from Cartoon Brew . It's basically about an island with peaceful citizens ( one of whom resembles Felix the Cat ) dancing to music before being invaded by a giant Mouse that resembles Mickey flying on a giant bat with a mouse-like head with others looking like them following . Then the islanders contact legendary folk-hero Momotaro from a giant book to battle " Mickey " . After defeating " Mickey " in a sword duel , the giant mouse falls through the clouds and grows very old after one of the doll inhabitants releases some spirit from a box . Also defeated are some snakes that spit bullets and many of the bats with mouse heads that also have ammunition in their mouths . Then at the end , the sun god makes blossoms appear on trees as the islanders ( which ounce again includes " Felix " ) dance happily ever after . . . Anyone who knows about Japanese history could probably tell that " Mickey " represents America which the country with the rising sun on their flag thought was about to attack them . On that note , I found this cartoon fascinating for its political-point-of-view . I was also entertained by the way this partly resembles many of the musical cartoons that we Americans made plenty of during much of early talkie era . One more bizarre scene was when " Felix " hit the turtle's head during the beginning dance sequence . Did he not realize he might be hurting that turtle physically ? With all that , this was one of the many fascinating Japanese cartoons I discovered on YouTube . By the way , although IMDb doesn't say so , this was directed by Komatsuzawa Hajime . P . S . The title translates into " Toybox Series # 3 : Picture Book 1936 " .
454191	11228318	6449	7.0	Bobby Bumps Starts a Lodge starts cruel then becomes amusing	During much of the cartoon , I thought Bobby was pretty cruel to both the goat ( I didn't like it when he jacked him up like that ) and the black boy who is supposed to be his friend ( when he blindfolded him and was going to have the goat butt him ) . But by the time the black boy was stuck on the tree with the bear between cliffs with Bobby on the other side and then Bobby was then stuck on a rope hanging on that same tree with the bear on top of him with each making truces , I forgave Bobby and was amused by the rest of the cartoon and the ending where they both get initiated into a lodge . You'll have to watch the cartoon on YouTube to see how it all ends . Worth a look for any silent animation buffs out there .
453764	11228318	38937	7.0	Shock is worthy of interest for Vincent Price fans	This movie , Shock , is noted by one thing : It's Vincent Price's first starring role after years in compelling supporting parts for 20th Century Fox . Here , he plays a psychiatrist whose murder of his wife is witnessed by a young woman ( Anabel Shaw ) across another hotel window as she waits for her returning soldier husband to come soon . The woman fainted from shock when the killing happened so when Price becomes her doctor , he and his mistress nurse ( Lynn Bari ) , try to fix it so everyone would be convinced she's crazy . I'll stop there and just say this is such a subtle suspense thriller that anyone expecting the kind of shocks today's horror / suspense fans get would be very disappointed in this one . Since this was made early in Price's career , his character has something of a conscience here . In fact , Ms . Bari steals her scenes from him as something of a Lady McBeth character . Ms . Shaw is also good in her constant frightfulness as she struggles to be heard and believed . By comparison , Frank Latimore as Shaw's husband is simply adequate as someone constantly trying to see his wife . Price himself handles his part capably . Also worth mentioning are John Davidson ( not to be confused with the singer who once co-hosted " That's Incredible " ) as crazy mental patient , Mr . Edwards , ( Loved the lightning sequence that involves him ) and Reed Hadley as D . A . O'Neill who's questioning of Price's Dr . Richard Cross threatens to drive Cross over the edge . I'd also like to note that the voice of Mrs . Cross , Ruth Clifford , was also that of Minnie Mouse at this time . While she's not noted on the DVD audio track by John Stanley , many of the leading and supporting players are of their lives , interests , and other roles . Not great but pretty good for anyone who's a fan of Vincent Price .
453981	11228318	47673	7.0	Irving Berlin's White Christmas is wonderful holiday fluff for the ages	To celebrate Christmas and to pay respects to Mr . Bing Crosby who died a little more than 30 years ago , I decided to watch for the first time in its entirety , White Christmas . This movie made of Irving Berlin songs both old and new , also stars Danny Kaye , Vera-Ellen , Rosemary Clooney , Dean Jagger , and Mary Wickes with some familiar bit players like Herb Vigran and Grady Sutton . Also , George Chakiris , best known as Bernardo in West Side Story , is a dancing extra here . The story of two former army buddies - turned - musical - partners who meet a two sister singing act that's on their way to a lodge owned by the general of the former army pals is just a contrivance to put together various songs to fit in certain segments . Good musical performances abound with some of my favorites being " Choreography " with Kaye and Vera-Ellen making fun of Jazz-Ballet and the " Count Your Blessings " duet with Crosby and Clooney . While I said the story is pretty contrived , I also was mostly willing to go along with most of it as the performers made it all go down easy with director Michael Curtiz lending a brisk pace throughout . The now-classic song " White Christmas " was probably better handled in Holiday Inn by Bing some 12 years before but still , it's a good way to both begin and end this wonderful showcase to Mr . Berlin that's become a holiday classic for the last 50 years . P . S . - The picture that Vera-Ellen show of she and Clooney's brother that served with Bing and Danny is that of former Our Ganger / Little Rascal Carl " Alfalfa " Switzer !
454834	11228318	235352	7.0	Dog Days is an amusingly sweet " Our Gang " entry	This Hal Roach comedy short , Dog Days , is the thirty-sixth entry in the " Our Gang / Little Rascals " series . As the short begins , Jackie's dog is jumping over his owner and Mickey and Joe . Mickey's dog learns how to sit . Both Mickey and Jackie say to Joe afterwards , " Let's see your dog p'form that trick . " Joe tries to get his dog to fetch a stick but he runs the other way . Mickey's mother comes and makes her son keep an eye on his baby brother Mortimer who's laying on a blanket at the field the gang is playing in . After she leaves , Mickey gives that job to his dog who's on a leash . Instead , while Mickey goes with his friends to look at a gopher , the dog takes off his collar and drinks the milk bottle that's near the baby . The dog also drinks some of a cat's milk nearby . After Mickey finds out , he disowns him . In another part of town , society girl Mary is taking a ride with a horse pulling her open-air carriage . For some reason , the horse gallops quickly causing Mary to panic . The gang sees this and Mickey sends his dog to rescue her . He does by confronting the horse . Mary , grateful for the dog and his owner for saving her life , invites the whole gang to her birthday party . When they arrive , the mother does not approve of her daughter's new scruffy friends but reluctantly gives in after Mary causes a fit . After Mary blows out her candles and everyone has cake , Mickey asks Joe where his dog is . Joe goes to the room his dog is in and finds a litter of puppies ! After showing everyone what happened , Joe says to Mickey , " Let's see your dog p'form that trick ! " . . . This was a sweetly amusing " Our Gang " entry that brings more smiles than laughs but the kids personalities are so charming at this point that you get sucked in just the same . Of note here is the addition of Eugene " Pinapple " Jackson , who replaced Ernie " Sunshine Sammy " Morrison a few shorts ago . Eugene got his nickname from Hal Roach because of his clutch of hair . Speaking of Ernie , his father , Ernie , Sr . , plays the butler here . So on that note , Dog Days is not hilarious in the usual Hal Roach tradition but is a sweetly amusing tale that does not overdo the sentiment . P . S . Kudos to the YouTube poster for once again adding the LeRoy Shield " Little Rascals " score to this short .
454574	11228318	1114740	7.0	Paul Blart : Mall Cop makes a nice time-filler for fans of likable Kevin James	After previously starring with Will Smith and Adam Sandler in their hits Hitch and I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry , respectively , Kevin James has his own solo success with this movie-Paul Blart : Mall Cop . It took a while for me but after the first 20 or so minutes , I was very willing to go for the ride and just laugh my ass off at the physical comedy that James provided especially as it seemed to threaten to get serious during the hostage scenes . Some of those bar scenes were especially funny . All I'll say now is , if you just want something to make you forget your troubles for a couple of hours , Paul Blart : Mall Cop makes a swell time to relax with .
454481	11228318	23783	7.0	Beau Bosko is a highly amusing Looney Tunes cartoon short	Since the previous reviewer mentioned nearly everything that happens in this cartoon , I really have nothing to add except to say , yes , this is a very amusing Bosko cartoon . And what a treat that the musical sequences is mostly limited to the beginning and not played or sung throughout ! Of course , many of the things that happen here could probably have happened to Mickey and Minnie if Hugh Harmon and Rudolf Ising were still working for Walt Disney ! Still , anyone interested in early Warner Bros . animation before the likes of Porky Pig , Daffy Duck , and Bugs Bunny became the studio's stars should be satisfied with many of the Looney Tunes-Merrie Melodies from the early ' 30s that appear on YouTube . That's all , folks !
455037	11228318	910580	7.0	Jack Meets Dennis is another amusing episode of 30 Rock	Liz is walking with her boyfriend Dennis to work . After he leaves , Jenna asks , " How's the sex ? " " Fast . And only on Saturday night , " Liz replies . Otherwise , it's not a very good relationship since he sells out-of-date beepers and attempts to sell them to Liz's staff during office hours . Tracy Jordan is upset at a tabloid depicting him as normal with a picture of him walking out of his apartment with a dog . " That was me walking backwards and , yes , I steal dogs ! " he says . To get some " street cred " back , he wears a fake tattoo on his face for a week . Meanwhile , Jenna gets some puffy lips after she gets interrogated about her age from Jack . She replies 29 . And Josh has been impersonating Liz Taylor who later exacts some revenge on him ! While all this is going on , Jack tries to mentor Liz about how wrong Dennis is for her but she'll have none of it . Jack then shows Liz a man she thinks he's setting her up with but Jack reveals he mentored him and now he's married to a Filipino woman with two kids . After Liz comes home with Dennis sleeping on a couch with a candle on his lap , she tries to break up with him but we later find he's now living with her . . . Funny episode , though a bit of a letdown from the previous " super-sized " one . Nice to see Liz and Jenna have more of a " best friends " vibe here . Especially loved the line about Jenna's puffy face from Liz : " It looks like someone boiled the water and threw it on your face ! " Loved Lonny Ross ' Josh and his encounter with Rachel Dratch's Liz Taylor ( along with the spotlight that only highlighted Taylor's eyes ) . Dean Winters is amusing as the clueless Dennis and I loved Baldwin's line about one of his beepers : " I'm expecting a call from 1983 . " With Jenna , Tracy , and Josh looking their worst during the dress rehearsal , the producer hopes for something to interrupt their program . Then comes a blackout ! After this show aired , NBC picked 30 Rock for a full season . Good for you , NBC ! And good luck to Tina and the rest of the cast !
455205	11228318	14811	7.0	The Cure is amusing old hat animation from Max Fleischer	As Ko-Ko and a rabbit are drawn in a forest , Ko-Ko has a toothache . When he asks why , Max says , " Shut up ! " as we see him also have one . The rabbit then tries to pull the tooth manually before he asks for help . Max obliges by drawing an instrument that pulls teeth . When the rabbit uses it as he pulls , he notices a big bump form on the top of Ko-Ko's head . He pushes it back only to form on the clown's back . Then he pushes it only to form on the clown's face where his lips are ! Finally , he pulls a whole apple out of the mouth curing Ko-Ko . They then turn to Max who is using laughing gas on his mouth as they tie a rope to the bad tooth . Max doesn't want them to do it till he's asleep so as Ko-Ko and the rabbit pull , Max draws on his paper that , when the clown and rabbit are in the dentist's office , is revealed to be a lion they've been pulling into ! The lion wants his tooth pulled out . As Ko-Ko looks on , the rabbit goes to the waiting room where a worm asks to be next . He changes his mind , however , when he hears gunshots ! Turns out Ko-Ko killed the lion and made him into a rug when the lion threatened to eat him ! Next , comes a dog whose weak eyetooth gets glasses and a cap , a bird who gets an actual plate on his beak , a clam who gets some dismembered teeth , a walrus that gets an actual miniature bridge between his two teeth , and a rhino that gets a small actual crown on the spot where Ko-Ko pulled his nose tooth down ! Max , watching all this , puts the laughing gas in the drawing where everyone laughs uncontrollably . Ko-Ko then comes out of the board and goes with the hose inside Max's suit sleeve and points it at Max as he is now laughing along with the furniture , his car outside , and the building he inhabits ! Before his employees come back to work , Ko-Ko pulls the rope on Max's tooth with him attached as he's being moved through the floor until he bumps at a wall and finally gets his tooth out ! Ko-Ko and the rabbit now go back in the pen which Max closes . . . Pretty amusing excuse to put gags that have double meanings , The Cure is probably old hat for today . Still , it's worth a look for anyone interested in seeing the early stages of mixing live-action and animation in the early 20th century .
454122	11228318	29969	7.0	While chaotic , The Captain's Christmas was a pretty enjoyable holiday cartoon starring The Captain and the Kids	Having just discovered this Christmas cartoon starring The Captain and the Kids on YouTube , I have to say-the plotting is all over the place what with peg-leg John stealing The Captain's disguise as Santa Claus , breaking into Mama and her boys'-Hans and Franz-house not to mention their toys and then vowing to make amends because of a crisis of conscience and not getting arrested for his previous doings ? Well , it is Christmas and forgiveness is ample here . Having said all that , there are some pretty funny gags here and I loved seeing John and his co-horts sing with their tongues moving up and down in rhythm and with Friz Freleng as director-having temporarily left Leon Schlesinger for M-G-M-you know you're getting some good musical animation . So with all that , I'll just be generous and recommend The Captain's Christmas .
454349	11228318	24569	7.0	Sittin ' on a Backyard Fence was another Schlesinger Merrie Melodies short from the early Warner Bros . cartoon years	This was a Merrie Melodies cartoon short from Leon Schlesinger incorporating a song owned by the Warner Bros . publishing company with its title being the one here . It involves a couple of male cats fighting for the love of one female feline . Loved scenes of the cats ' skeletons appearing when they cross a full moon , some sequences involving a rolling pin and telephone wires , the male cats ' fight with a bulldog , and the final scene . This early short was directed by Earl Duvall who helmed some bland Buddy cartoons after Harmon-Ising left Schlesinger and took Bosko with them to M-G-M . Worth a look for animation buffs , this was on Daily Motion .
454880	11228318	12347	7.0	Kid Speed has Larry Semon with Oliver Hardy in good support	Kid Speed is another Larry Semon short with Oliver Hardy in support that I found on a Platinum DVD Laurel and Hardy collection . This time Hardy and Semon are car race rivals for a girl's affection . Since Hardy is the heavy , he's the one who tries to keep Semon from winning with help from various friends . One of my favorite gags involves Hardy and pals washing themselves with water from a barrel when another barrel on the roof spills tar through a roof hole into the water barrel causing Hardy and friends to look pitch black ! There's also plenty of laughs involving people slipping into and out of automobiles and one more involving the winner and girl with white paint on the winner's face ! Larry Semon is funny throughout and Hardy once again displays mannerisms that would come full fruition when he eventually teamed with Stan Laurel . By all means , seek this one out !
454844	11228318	898023	7.0	Pilot of " Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles " is pretty good start of new series	It's 1999 and Sarah Connor ( Lena Headey ) has a nightmare that her teenage son , John ( Thomas Dekker ) , gets killed and a terminator robot chokes her . She wakes up at this point in bed with her fiancée who is offering her a ring . Next day , she tells John they're moving . John is puzzled . At the new school , he meets a girl named Cameron ( Summer Glau ) . Each tells about their parents which they both later reveal were lies . Both John and his mother figure out Cameron is an android from the future . It's in the new classroom that a new teacher is presiding . As he goes through the roll call , when he comes upon the name John ' Reese ' and John raises his hand as that alias is called , the " teacher " ( who's actually a cyborg ) starts shooting , " wounding " Cameron and making John run through a window . When a truck violently backs into this teacher , the driver , Cameron , says those famous seven words , " Come with me if you want to live " to John as another Terminator adventure begins . . . Nice continuation of T2 ( T3 being ignored at this point ) . Cool to see three cult actors ( Headey from 300 , Dekker from " Heroes " , and especially Glau from " Firefly " / Serenity ) . All are pretty good , if not great , in their roles . Good sprinkling of action and humor throughout . Can't wait to see the next episode . . .
455041	11228318	156031	7.0	Max Fleischer's Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer is enjoyable animated Christmas short	Long surpassed by the 1964 Rankin / Bass version , this 1948 animated version of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer directed by Max Fleischer is enjoyable in its own right . Narrated by Paul Wing , the story begins with the lead character already not allowed to skate on ice with the others ( all of whom wear pillows on their backs to break their falls ) . His mother then calls him ( there's no father here ) and as Rudolph sleeps in his bed , Santa has trouble with his eight reindeer ( who he calls by name as they pass him ) with the fog and blizzard in his way . If you know the song by heart ( and who doesn't ? ) , you can figure out what happens next and I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't heard of this story yet . Nice animation throughout and good pacing for a 7-minute short . Worth seeing for Fleischer , Rudolph , and animation fans .
454493	11228318	1248333	7.0	Larry King was a pretty funny , if not hilarious , episode of " 30 Rock "	In this one , Jack and Elisa are having relationship problems , Liz and Kenneth attempt to recover Liz ' cell from a cabbie , and Tracy on " Larry King Live " tells everyone to panic when the Asian markets fall . . . Not quite as funny as previous eps of " 30 Rock " and I can't help thinking the staffers looking for Tracy's money in his office is excuse for them having something to do especially the Scott Adsit character since this is one of his rare appearances this season but there are still some pretty funny lines and scenes and it's touching how the Kenneth character really is in certain situations . Also touching was Salma Hayak's exit for this arc . Hope she's available for a comeback . And how about Liz ' nana's " lullaby " song being " 99 Luftballons " . . .
453969	11228318	20983	7.0	Hold Anything is a pretty entertaining musical Bosko cartoon short	Since the previous reviewer mentioned most of the details of Hold Anything , I'll just mention that the mice look uncannily like Walt Disney's Mickey . Perhaps not surprising since directors Hugh Harmon and Rudolf Ising had previously worked for Disney as animators when he created Oswald the Lucky Rabbit with Ub Iwerks with the rabbit looking like the Famous Mouse with long ears and a fluffy tail . Another entertaining musical short that seems inspired by the fame of the first successful sound cartoon , Steamboat Willie , that put Mickey Mouse and Walt Disney on the map of iconic status . Worth a look for anyone interested in Warner Bros . animation before Tex Avery arrived to give it a new identity .
454132	11228318	883000	7.0	Jack the Writer is another funny episode of 30 Rock	As Liz tries to rally her staff on material , the receptionist keeps distracting the mostly male members with her clothing and various positions so Liz tries to get her to do something else but her staff keeps looking at her so Liz tells her to leave before one of her staff tells Liz that her last suggestion sucked . Boss Jack manages to get himself invited to these meetings to the consternation of Liz and the rest of her staff . Meanwhile , Tracy gets the page Kenneth to do various chores for him such as getting a nacho from Yankee Stadium . After Liz gets Jack off her staffs ' back , Jack doesn't speak to her for awhile . They make up when Jack gets tickets for a music act Liz enjoys but goes back to boss-employee after Liz asks to eat pizza on the roof in front of Jack's superiors . . . Another funny episode with highlights being Liz's talk with receptionist on her clothing and receptionist's dress gift to Liz which gets laughs from her crew . Funniest episodes yet .
454129	11228318	902135	7.0	Hugh Laurie and Beck on Saturday Night Live	Since this episode aired on October 28 , 2006 , expect some jokes or sketches about both Halloween and the upcoming congressional elections . Lorne Michaels , the executive producer , appears in the cold opening mentioning the recent network cuts as he gives five minutes of his program to a foreign correspondent . It's Borat , played by Sacha Baron Cohen , a Kazakistan reporter . He basically speaks in broken English constantly repeating " Swing ! " from Wayne's World while shaking himself . After a lot of tasteless , but funny , material Borat says , " Live from New York , home of the Jew ( grimaces ) , it's Saturday Night ! " After opening credits , Hugh Laurie comes on stage speaking in his natural British accent and talks about English humor ( " which is spelled with a ' u ' where I'm from " ) . He also points out England is " where my right nipple is , if I had one " after given a map of the United States . First sketch is a parody of a paranormal show in which Bill Hader , Fred Arminsen , and Amy Poelher try to identify what Hugh's fart is saying . Hilarious ! In a Fox World Series sketch , Maya Rudolph is the winner of the National Anthem contest so she begins the game with a shrill rendition mixed with some lyric's to " Take Me Out to the Ball Game " . On TV Funhouse , we are shown an actual Republican public service ad showing Osama bin laden's photo with a quote of " kill all Americans " emphasized . The cartoon Bush then shows a couple of spoofs : The first one has a cut-off of Ted Kennedy saying " We'll cut and run " before Frenching Osama with Barak Obama in Count von Count makeup with a " Count Obama " T-shirt saying , " One abortion bill , two abortion bill " . The second has a pregnant woman opening the door for trick-or-treaters with Hilary Clinton coming out of her womb and then licking pregnant woman's face ! That one scares W . as he asks Cheney how much longer . " Two years " is the answer as credits roll . It should come as no surprise that Al Franken was one of the writers of this cartoon . On Hardball , Chris Mathews ( Darrell Hammond ) talks to Republican Ken Mehlman ( Andy Samberg ) about one of the congressman being a TCBY strangler . Mehlman says he's already been replaced by John Wayne Gacy , Jr . ( Photo shows him looking exactly like his father ) . Democrat chairman Howard Dean ( Jason Sudakis ) mentions his party will raise taxes for everyone including " the very , very , poor " and " we're bad on defense " though the poll shows the public disagreeing . He then challenges Mehlman to a fight as sketch ends . Laurie is once again standing on home base as he sings a protest folk song while muffling what he's protesting about . In a hotel sketch , Laurie is representing the queen and telling coordinator Kristen Wiig what the queen expects when she comes like " wanting to have mini tables and chairs so she can feel superior " not to mention wanting " mini-guards to run from the queen " . Needless to say , Hugh won't show up when she arrives . Beck sing his first set , " Nausea " with small marionettes of his band to the right of them . On Weekend Update , Amy begins by saying President Bush will change from saying " Stay the Course " to " Think Outside the Bun " . Seth Myers mentions New Jersey's favorable ruling of gay civil unions leading to Armisen and Hader portraying an Italian gay couple who say " oh ! " a lot . Commenting on the upcoming elections is Congressman Tim Calhoun ( Will Forte ) . Among his beliefs : " I've always loved pages . . . I'm a voracious reader . . . of child pornography . . . studies . " " I did not approve this message . " In a hospital sketch , Kenan Thompson has a broken leg but doesn't trust Dr . Forte's diagnosis . Neither does his " wife " Laurie who is in blond wig and a dress . It ends , after Kenan falls down trying to leave , with Laurie telling us to trust your physician even though they don't do like the TV doctors ( Hugh seems to imply on a particular doc he plays on Fox . . . ) . On the Late Late Movie ( announcer asks , " Are those still around ? " ) , English villagers are looking for Dr . Frankenstein . The Monster ( Bill Hader ) says that he's not here and directs them to the other side where Dracula ( Jason Sudakis ) tells them to go back . Monster again tells them they're in the wrong castle and then accuses them of racism ( because of his green skin ) . Then his arm falls off as the The Late Late Movie ends ( with announcer saying , " Seriously , I thought these things ended 10 years ago . " ) . Next Beck performs , " Clap Hands " with him playing guitar and harmonica while the other members bang utensils on plates at a table they're sitting at with a turkey displayed and marionettes again performing at their side . Finally , Laurie and Armisen are partners at a law firm interviewing Poehler for a job and complimenting her achievements with " oooouuuu " . When Amy gets hired , she does some " oooouuuu " herself before getting fired because it's interpreted as sarcastic by the partners . After that are the goodnights . . . Most of the highlights I've mentioned are from the first 30 minutes . The show loses a little steam after Weekend Update but it's consistently amusing throughout . Beck's performances were certainly some of the most unusual I've seen in the history of SNL . Hugh certainly holds his own throughout . So overall , a good show . Next time , Alec Baldwin and Christina Agulera .
455010	11228318	873358	7.0	Saturday Night Live starts 32nd season with Dane Cook and the Killers	On the September 30 , 2006 cold opening , we are at a South Carolina town hall where the state comptroller ( Jason Sudeikis ) is speaking . All of his supporters , including President George W . Bush ( Will Forte ) , are there . Bush annoys some people with his constant speaking during the speech . Sudeikis ends up saying , " Live from New York , It's Saturday Night . " New montage is revealed for the 32nd season opener with Sudeikis , Bill Hader , and Kristen Wiig no longer featured players . In fact , there are no featured players this season . Dane Cook then does a 10-minute monologue about how some friends committed suicide , and some YouTube videos . First sketch is about Federal Aviation's meeting about what constitutes liquid ( no , not turkey sandwiches ) . Next , Hugo Chavez ( Fred Armisen ) has a McLaughlin Group-style discussion with other foreign leaders about the evils of America and Bush . In " Al Pacino Balances His Check " , Pacino ( Hader ) calls someone at Wells Fargo ( Wiig ) to transfer some of his savings to checking . Musical guest The Killers perform their first song , " When You Were Young . " We then see Amy at the Update desk being greeted by Brian Williams ( yes , the real one ) , who is expected to be the new co-anchor . Actually , it's Seth Myers . Williams leaves disappointed . After commercial break , Don Pardo , for the first time since Norm McDonald , introduces the new Weekend Update team . Amy begins by mentioning that two foreign leaders refuse to shake hands at the White House which is made more awkward when Osama bin laden shows up . Senator George Allen ( Sudeikis ) apologizes for saying the word " macaca " , Dustin " Screech " Diamond ( Andy Samberg ) tries to plug his sex video , and Myers ends with an item about a robber trying to steal a Tickle Me , Elmo doll getting subdued by a Give Me a Reason , Bert one with a picture of Bert with a switchblade behind Seth . Update simply ends with Amy and Seth saying good night and shaking hands . Next sketch has Cook and Forte as water delivery men who get caught hiding empty bottles from boss Wiig ( amusing scene of bottle after bottle falling in closet lasts about two minutes ) that ends with them getting fired and Forte mentioning a friend from SNL who will submit the sketch we just saw and also mentioning having another friend from Studio 60 while Cook mentions knowing someone from 30 Rock ( though the show in that one is actually titled , " The Girlie Show " ) . The Killers perform their second song , " Bones " then , after another commercial break , Amy appears as a spaced out Farrah Fawcett plugging a save the ocean life PSA before leaving set to appear in a closing time sketch . This sketch has Cook and Sudeikis forcing customers to leave bar by any means necessary . Finally , a Geico commercial parody with Samberg as a college student and Maya Rudolph as Whitney Houston mentioning her past drug problems . Mostly amusing show with the highlights being Hugh Chavez , Federal Avation meeting , and another Update piece with Bill Clinton ( Darrell Hammond ) and Condi Rice ( Rudolph ) as well as Pacino , some of the water bottle sketch , and a digital short called Cubicle Fighting . This was Cook's second show and he did fine throughout . The next episode will have Jamie Pressley with musical guest Corinne Bailey Rae .
454663	11228318	27273	7.0	Thelma Todd shines in last short performance	This is the last short Thelma Todd did with Patsy Kelly before her death from mysterious circumstances . All-American Toothache concerns an upcoming college football game that will be lost unless quarterback ( and former Our Ganger ) Mickey Daniels passes his dentistry exam which hinges on his getting a wisdom tooth . Todd and Kelly are waitresses who work in a nearby diner that many of Daniels ' teammates go to . When they mention to Todd their troubles concerning Mickey , Todd manages to convince Kelly ( without telling her why ) to have her wisdom tooth pulled . As they sit in the waiting room , they hear drills so loud that Patsy almost leaves before coming to where the drills were from and finding out that they were overhearing two men trying to fix a sink ! The actual dentist , Mickey's teacher , is puzzled when Thelma tells him they want his student , not him . This results in a mix-up between Mickey's teammates and his fellow dental students . Very amusing banter between Thelma and Patsy and hilarious performance from Mickey Daniels ( especially when you hear his donkey laugh ! ) . It almost loses steam in the end but there's one more twist at the end that I won't reveal here . Good direction from usual Our Gang helmer Gus Meins . If you're a Hal Roach completist , by all means seek this one out !
454904	11228318	776023	7.0	The Hellcats is a pretty funny episode of " Mystery Science Theater 3000 "	After watching the original , uncut theatrical version of The Hellcats , I was anxious to watch MST3K's version . Loved many references to " How the Grinch Stole Christmas " that Joel and the ' bots threw at the screen . They also point out how pointless many motorcycle scenes as well as those that depict the cycle gang partying and copping a feel on some of the hot ladies are . They also make fun of the leading man , Ross Hagen ( who starred in another MST3K victim , The Sidehackers ) , and the director , Robert Slatzer , who has a role as a drug dealer here . The in-between segments has each of the characters doing a visual diary of their day in the Satellite Of Love complete with flashback scenes provided by Cambot . I loved the one when Joel points out pictures to the ' bots making them guess if it's funny or not . They correctly pick Sally Field as The Flying Nun as not ! LOL ! Very good episode of " Mystery Science Theter 3000 " . With the Christmas season coming , I may review Santa Claus Conquers the Martians next . Until then . . .
454557	11228318	25529	7.0	Duke Ellington in his brief number was the highlight of Murder at the Vanities	Since this is Black History Month and I'm reviewing the achievements of many African-Americans on film in chronological order , I got this movie on VHS from the library because Duke Ellington and his Orchestra were in it . Their jazz version of Franz Liszt's " Rhapsody " was the highlight of this mostly overlong murder mystery-musical comedy mixture . Many other numbers I liked were Kitty Carlisle's especially " Sweet Marijuana " , Carl Brisson's " Cocktails for Two " as well as his duet with Carlisle on that earlier , and the ones by Gertrude Michael who's great as the woman you love to hate . Jack Oakie and Victor McLaglen probably go a little too long with their love / hate banter as the producer and detective but they grow on you . And Toby Wing is a sexy dumb tease as Nancy who keeps trying to say something to Oakie but gets a " Not now " from him every time . While many of the characters have a motive for the murders that happen , I wasn't surprised by the revelation of who done it . And get a load of how naked the women here are ( though of course their breasts are covered , either by their hands or some flimsy top ) . This was very obviously pre-Code . Worth a look for any film buff interested in this sort of thing . P . S . As a long-time Louisiana resident , I like noting when someone was born here as Carlisle was a New Orleans native .
454869	11228318	30682	8.0	Riding the Rails is another cute Betty Boop / Pudgy cartoon I watched on YouTube	This is another latter-day ( read : post-Code ) Betty Boop cartoon I watched on YouTube . It also features her puppy dog , Pudgy . Betty takes the train to work and tries to leave Pudgy behind but , unbeknownst to her , the dog goes along for the ride . . . Plenty of funny gags concerning automatic train doors , a woman hitting a man after Pudgy touches her leg , a heavyset man crowding some people on a bench , and the train itself making a face . There's also a thrilling chase concerning Pudgy and the train that results in one final gag in the present Betty gives him . In summary , if you don't mind the cleaned-up version of Betty here and can't get enough of her dog , I highly recommend Riding the Rails .
454000	11228318	149692	8.0	Apache Kid is one really weird pre-Code Krazy Kat cartoon	This is a really weird cartoon from Columbia Pictures ' Winkler / Mintz Studios starring Krazy Kat who , while based on George Herriman's comic strip character , is characterized much differently here . He plays the piano at a beat down nightclub while his girlfriend warbles a tune in between kissing him from the top of the piano . After doing their Apache dance , this girl gets kidnapped by a big bully of a cat . That's all I'll say except there are lots of pre-Code weird imagery like the way the villain grabs the girl by her upper body part or when one of the nightclub patrons smokes a cigarette shaped like a real camel ! I didn't find myself laughing as just marveling at how much the animators twist many animals and objects into such unusual shapes or positions that became rarer as years and decades passed on . So for that reason , I highly recommend Apache Kid .
455046	11228318	30465	8.0	Mother Goose Goes Hollywood was an entertaining Disney Silly Symphony featuring celebrity caricatures	I just recently ( as of today ) discovered a blog devoted to Cab Calloway called The Hi-De-Ho Blog . One section showcases caricatures of the legendary entertainer in various cartoons from Max Fleischer ( whose shorts Cab actually was involved in ) , Warner Bros . , M-G-M , and this one from Walt Disney in which Mother Goose characters are depicted as Hollywood celebrities . Mr . Calloway is one of the " four blackbirds in a pie sequence " and while that may have an unfortunate stereotypical connotation ( which may be true of some of the white celebrities too ) , seeing " Cab " , " Fats " , and " Louis " do their musical stuff was enjoyable . The only real negative portrayal of an African-American here was that of the lazy , shiftless , Stepin Fetchit character . Other depictions of celebrities I liked were that of W . C . Fields with Charlie McCarthy with Fields as Humpty Dumpty , The Marx Brothers sans Zeppo as the Fidlers Three ( Harpo appears here as a redhead and not a blonde ) , and Laurel and Hardy as Simple Simon and the Pieman with welcome use of Marvin Hatley's L & H musical theme " The Cukoo Song ( Dance of the Cukoos ) " . If there's one celebrity that may be obscure even to old movie buffs , it might be that of Joe Penner whose catchphrase " Wanna buy a duck ? " anticipates a very familiar Disney character . So despite some negative stereotypical characterizations , I recommend Mother Goose Goes Hollywood for any animation buff especially those of old-time movie star caricatures .
454820	11228318	1054841	8.0	Lizards brings more intriguing stuff to " Heroes "	When we last left " Heroes " , Peter , who has amnesia , was being beaten by some toughs in Ireland . After getting knocked out , a woman who's associated with them looks at his bloody face and gets startled when the stains disappear in thin air . In California , Claire , after recovering her mom's ring from boiling water wants to know why she has to pass as " normal " when she feels constricted . Noah explains about people wanting to torture her if they're found out . In New York , Matt investigates Hiro's father's death and questions Ando about the symbol discovered on the picture of the father just before the murder . Hiro is also briefly mentioned as we go back to 17th century Japan where Hiro , after finding his hero out cold , takes his costume and becomes " Takezo Sensei " as he uses his teleporting powers to make his foes ' weapons vanish from one place to another . This all impresses the lady who was fighting them beforehand and she waits for his kiss . But Hiro disappears as pink blossom leaves fall all around her . In Hounduras , the twins , Alejandro and Maya , struggle to find a way to get to America as a healer fails to heal Maya and , later at night , an elderly female guide dies inadvertently under Maya's bloody eyes before Alajandro makes the stain disappear and the guide gets up cursing them as she leaves . Mohinder goes to Haiti to cure someone who has the same disease that killed his sister in 1974 . It's the guy who worked for Noah by erasing minds ! Next we see after Mohinder injects the needle , he's back to where his employer that we saw last week asks about him and all Mohinder remembers is the assignment he just got from him ! Back at school , Claire watches in fascination a film about lizards regenerating after losing an arm and asks questions about humans doing the same thing which arouses the curiosity of the boy who flew last week . She brushes him off . And then finds her car stolen ! Back in Japan , Hiro is confronted by Takezo about his stolen costume when the lady comes and thanks Takezo personally . Because of her , he agrees to fulfill his destiny but then gets shot by arrows that seem to kill him . But , suddenly , the blood seems to disappear . Back in New York , Matt questions Mrs . Petrelli about the murder of Hiro's father . She admits to once having an affair with him but refuses to answer any more . Reading her mind , Matt gets some info about revenge but is told by her reading his mind to back off ! As Matt goes to meet son Nathan , they hear a noise and find Nathan's mother in critical condition as her picture is found with the symbol on it . In Ireland , one of Peter's tormentors finds a box and with it , now knows the name of the amnesia-afflicted victim . He offers to give him the box if he does something for him and the woman who treated him . Mohinder calls Noah and tells him about the Haitian . As Noah hangs up , he sees that Haitian in front of him as they get reacquainted . Claire , at home , cuts her smallest toe and , 30 seconds later , grows one back just as that boy sees the scene through the window . Claire goes outside to confront him but he disappears leaving a book by Mohinder's father that he recommended to her earlier as " To Be Continued " appears on screen . . . Wow , a lot to mention as you can tell by my long synopsis . All of them pretty intriguing . Disappointed not to be seeing DL , Niki / Jessica , Micah , or Sylar like the promos seem to be promising but as the weeks go , I'm sure we will . Should really make for another interesting season . On that note , until next time . . .
454214	11228318	1001572	8.0	SeinfeldVision marks a hilarious new start for " 30 Rock " s second season	After more than 3 months , " 30 Rock " is back with a new episode . Glad it's back , especially after it won the Emmy for Best Comedy ( loved Ms . Fey's acceptance speech in which she thanked " dozens and dozens of viewers " ) . This episode begins with Liz and Jack saying how good their summers been ( Liz doing a long quilt after breaking up with Floyd , Jack putting successful reality shows like " MILF Island " on after his surgery ) and how it's going to be a great year . Both , though , have their own troubles : Jack has been digitalizing Jerry Seinfeld on all the NBC shows without Jerry's approval , Liz keeps calling Floyd's apartment in Cleveland . Also , Tracy Jordan now lives in the building with Kenneth since his wife threw him out . Meanwhile , Jenna has gained a lot more weight since she kept eating pizza while performing in " Mystic Pizza : The Musical " on Broadway . And Seinfied , having found out about Jack's deceit during his family vacation in Europe , comes back to NBC . . . Many funny lines abound in this Fey-written season premiere with some favorites being Alec Baldwin's " Liz , women your age are more likely to be mauled by a bear than getting married " or Cerie's ( Katrina Bowden ) exchange to Liz after Liz accepted a bridesmaid invitation : " Now I've got something old . " Also loved Kenneth's creepy grin whenever he sees Seinfeld and his reciting the guy's TV theme in front of him to which Jerry can only reply , " Really ? " So much stuff that was funny that I won't reveal here . And nice to find out the ratings have indeed improved so on that note , to quote Jack and Liz , I think it's certainly going to be their year !
453841	11228318	603004	8.0	This episode of " The Hollywood Palace " should be of great interest to fans of Groucho Marx and Margaret Dumont	Just watched on YouTube this special episode of " The Hollywood Palace " hosted by Groucho Marx . What was so special about it ? Well , besides his 18-year-old daughter Melinda singing her Petulia Clark-like number called " The East Side of Town " as well as a duet with her father , this particular show marked the last appearance of Groucho's frequent movie and stage co-star-not to mention " The fifth Marx Brother " - Margaret Dumont who died not long after this show was taped and a few weeks before this aired . It's the " Hooray for Captain Spalding " number and despite Groucho's claim that Ms . Dumont never got any of his or his brothers ' jokes , the real-life wealthy dowager cracks up every time he opens his mouth . By the way , loved the " Peyton Place " reference ! There was also a unicycle act called The Four Kents , a Scottish comedian who plays the piano named Don Saunders , African singer Miriam Makeba , flamenco dancer Lydia Torea , and husband-and-wife singing team Gordon and Sheila MacRae ( I did not see other scheduled guest Shecky Greene so I must have watched an edited version online ) . Mr . Marx was entertainingly witty the whole time and hardly seemed old compared to ten years later . If you're a die-hard Marx Brothers fan and are curious about the last team-up of Groucho and Dumont , I highly recommend this episode of " The Hollywood Palace " .
455158	11228318	800972	8.0	" Family Portraits : The Marx Brothers " is an affectionate tribute from the children of their famous fathers	Narrated by AMC's host Bob Dorian , this program showcased family members of The Marx Brothers . Among them who appeared on camera were Susan Fleming ( Harpo's wife ) , Bill Marx ( Harpo's son ) , Minnie Marx ( Harpo's daughter ) , Maxine Marx ( Chico's daughter ) , and Miriam Marx ( Groucho's daughter ) . This show was divided into three segments . On Harpo , we see home movie footage of him without his wig and costume . In fact , he's really quite bald here with brown hair on the back but his expressions and movements are unmistakably Harpo's with the playfulness he displays with his wife and kids . On Groucho , there's plenty of stills of him with his first two kids , Arthur and Miriam , and his first wife and their mother , Ruth , who was revealed to be somewhat of an alcoholic . We also see some film clips of other daughter , Melinda , as both child and young adult singing both solo and with her father . And on Chico , there are plenty of stills of him with Maxine and her mother . His taking over management of his team from mother Minnie and his compulsive gambling is also mentioned here but in mostly forgiving terms by his daughter . Loved seeing Harpo's clown painting displayed here and his son Bill mentioning playing piano at Groucho's various parties during the latter's final days . All in all , a very affectionate tribute to the Marx children's fathers as they were off-screen . Well worth seeing for Marx Brothers fans .
455000	11228318	150578	8.0	The Flamboyant Arms is a highly amusing Deitch / Terrytoon short	This is a latter-day Terrytoons short from the Gene Deitch era . It stars Clint Clobber , a janitor for an apartment . In this one , he has to hurry up and make sure the building is spic and span for inspection by the building's owner . Of course , everything goes disastrously wrong from sewer trash rising to lights blinking to water pipes blowing to Clobber electrocuting himself ! Well timed pacing by director Connie Rasinski makes this one of the funnier cartoons from the late ' 50s . Well worth seeing on YouTube for anyone who's a fan of Deitch or Terrytoons . Maybe someday , a collection of many of these forgotten animated shorts will be made available for viewing on DVD .
454777	11228318	48649	8.0	Speedy Gonzales gave us the " fastest mouse in all Mexico " as we know him today	Despite the title , this is Speedy Gonzales ' SECOND appearance , after Robert McKimson's Cat-Tails for Two . This is , however , his first time in the costume and design we know him from . In this short , after another mouse gets done for in trying to get cheese past the guard-Sylvester , Speedy accepts the challenge . The red-nosed cat is ready for the " fastest mouse in all Mexico " but gets defeated at every turn . This Oscar-winning cartoon from Friz Freling gives us another classic Warner Bros . character that lasts for decades despite some PC controversy that almost got Speedy gone for good . Turns out many Hispanics consider Mr . Gonzales a hero for his exploits and don't find anything offensive about him . I certainly don't and I never understood why anyone would either . Anyway , while I don't consider this a great cartoon , it's certainly another highly enjoyable outing from Mr . Freling .
454775	11228318	40361	8.0	The Foghorn Leghorn is a classic starring the loud-mouth rooster	Once again , Henery Hawk is looking for a chicken to catch and once again , he doesn't know what a chicken looks like . When he sees his father looking at Foghorn Leghorn , the father , because he doesn't like his son tagging along , tells him he's not a chicken but a " snook " . Supposedly because his ego is deflated , Foghorn keeps trying to convince Henery he really is a chicken . Of course , there's also the Barnyard Dog he has to deal with . . . Seeing the Southern rooster make some awful puns always gets a smile from me and occasionally even a laugh and it's always great to see him and the Barnyard Dog play tricks on each other . While Henery also provides some amusement , I was glad when he was eventually jettisoned for some other supporting characters like Prissy and her intellectual son . Anyway , The Foghorn Leghorn is another classic from the Robert McKimson unit .
454803	11228318	101258	9.0	Wong Kar-Wai's Days of Being Wild is one of the most compelling foreign-language films I've seen so far	Days of Being Wild is the first film I've seen directed by Wong Kar-Wai as well as the first time I've seen any of the actors that I'll now list here : Leslie Cheung , Maggie Cheung , Andy Law , Carina Lau , and Tony Leung . Those beginning scenes with Leslie and Maggie are some of the most erotically charged I've seen in movies yet and I haven't seen too many adult dramas as you've probably guessed if you've read all my comments so far . The gradual , quiet , and eventual shattering desperateness that involves most of the characters made this movie very compelling even during very slow scenes in which nothing happens . Both Maggie and Carina Lau are sexy in their own way with their individual scenes with Leslie Cheung and their one confrontation is one of my favorite scenes here . Also loved Andy Lau's policeman character and his keeping Maggie company as she recovers from her affair with Leslie . Just about everything is compelling about Days of Being Wild though I admit being confused with Tony Leung's only scene at the end . Knowing that an unfinished sequel exists based on that frame makes me hope to one day get to be able to view it eventually . . .
454106	11228318	136337	9.0	Ko-Ko's Reward is another enjoyable Max Fleischer cartoon short	In Ko-Ko's Reward , Max has his daughter ( possibly his real one ) with him when he once again draws Ko-Ko the Clown and his dog , Fitz , with their heads initially on the wrong bodies . After the switch , the little girl gets a little bored and puts magic ink which allows her to become an animated drawing herself as she goes on the drawing board which has a shack illustrated on it . Since Ko-Ko , Fitz , and Max didn't see her enter , however , Max tells his cartoon stars to find his daughter as Ko-Ko and Fitz step outside the drawing board to search a nearby amusement park for her . When they return to the board , they encounter a skeleton , Fitz finds a witch who boils him into hot dogs before he turns back to normal , and they are chased by a sheeted ghost before it's revealed to be the little girl who laughs at the whole thing ! As she goes back outside and changes back to her live-action self , Max tells her to reward Ko-Ko and Fitz for finding her . She obliges be kissing them . . . I saw this on YouTube which had music by Leroy Shield for Hal Roach shorts and sound effects added , all to great effect . Some of the most charming Fleischer shorts ever came from this era . This one had the added enjoyment of some chills especially the hot dog one that probably wouldn't go well on Saturday morning TV today . Still , well worth seeing for anyone who loves all things Fleischer .
454124	11228318	152497	9.0	The Snow Man was a quite effective atmospheric Terrytoon cartoon	Just watched this Terrytoons winter cartoon on YouTube whose uploader mistakenly identified this as a Van Beuren one directed by Ted Esbaugh . Manny Davis actually made this one and he provides some amusement in the beginning when an Eskimo says goodbye to his seal , who barks like a dog here , into his igloo and sets his alarm clock for July ! Also , his fox blanket licks him before sleeping ! By the time the Eskimo wakes up , the seal had some offspring with the help of the stork that follows them ! While it's now July , there's still snow so all the animals wake up and make a snowman . Then after dancing around it , that snowman turns abominable scaring everyone away . . . During the abominable snowman sequence , nothing funny happens save for one scene when the snowman plays on the organ and does his Jimmy Durante impression saying , " Hot-cha-cha ! " Quite effective during these horror moments so I'd watch any kid under 6 who sees this on television , VHS , or DVD . On that note , I recommend The Snow Man to any animation buff out there .
454813	11228318	43495	9.0	Loved the cat's reactions in Early to Bet	This Robert McKimson cartoon , Early to Bet , stars a gambling bug who decides to bite a compulsive cat who's trying to give up . But every time the bug bites him , the cat always goes to this bulldog who makes him spin a penalty wheel when he loses the card game . Then after picking the file with the number that the arrow pointed toward , he looks at it and says , " No , not the Geshunheit . Not the Geshunheit ! NOT THE GESHUNHEIT ! " After a few more repeats of this , the dog declines the now-injured cat's attempts to play Gin so the bug takes the dog's place . Bad idea as the bug gets the card one number lower than 3 ! " No , not the Post ! " is shouted as the short ends . Loved the way the cat bounces up and down after the bug keeps biting him . Also loved the penalties he keeps getting . Early to Bet is another cartoon I highly recommend .
453997	11228318	152329	9.0	Scrappy's Ghost Story is another cartoon gem I discovered starring the now-obscure Scrappy	Just watched on YouTube this Columbia ( though the print I watched had the heading " Samba Pictures Inc . Presents " ) / Charles Mintz cartoon starring a now forgotten little boy named Scrappy . In this one , Scrappy is telling his little brother a ghost story in the dark by the lit fireplace . Then he encounters a real ghost . That leads to a musical sequence of other apparitions ( including some of caricatured blacks that might be considered offensive today ) scaring him and his little brother . I'll stop there and just say how entertainingly atmospheric and musical this cartoon was and how I love watching these now-obscure gems whenever I go on the internet . So on that note , I highly recommend Scrappy's Ghost Story .
455177	11228318	452716	9.0	Buffy the Vampire Slayer : Welcome to the Hellmouth is very good beginning for cult series	Sunday , September 17 , 2006 marked the last broadcast of the WB . It was marked by airing the pilots of the following classics : Felicity , Angel , Buffy the Vampire Slayer , and Dawson's Creek . Buffy the Vampire Slayer was originally a movie from 1992 starring Kristy Swanson and Luke Perry . That movie's writer , Joss Whedon , wasn't satisfied with the final result so he tried again with a TV series with himself as executive producer . Buffy Summers ( Sarah Michelle Gellar ) moves to Sunnydale from L . A . with her mother ( Kristine Sutherland ) , having been kicked out of her last high school . There she's befriended by Cordelia Chase ( Chrisma Carpenter ) who tries to introduce Buffy to her clique . But Buffy takes more of a shine to shy Willow ( Alyson Hannigan ) and her friends Xander ( Nicholas Brendan ) and Jesse ( Eric Balfour ) . As she enters the school library , she encounters a bespectacled man with a British accent named Rupert Giles ( Anthony Stewart Head ) who knows Buffy's a slayer and identifies himself as her watcher . Buffy really just wants a normal life . Giles explains what his and her duties are . Meanwhile , a dead body appears in a girl's locker . . . Very good first episode of what would be an outstanding series . Gellar , Hannigan , Brendan , and Head already make a fine team with Carpenter perfect as the stuck-up one . Also making first appearances are Angel ( David Boreanaz ) who is not yet identified as a vampire and Darla ( Julie Benz ) , not yet known as Angel's former lover . This was the first WB show that truly gave the network an identity as the one that teens could relate to . So it's fitting that it should air on the WB's last day . So long , WB . It's been nice knowing you for the past 11 years . . .
454014	11228318	37758	9.0	A Gun in His Hand is another " Crime Does Not Pay " short well worth seeking	This is another of M-G-M's " Crime Does Not Pay " shorts that appeared in the " Special Features " section of the DVD " Film Noir : Bringing Darkness to Light " . In this one , rookie cop Dennis Nordell ( Tom Trout ) , after graduating from police academy , goes back to his crooked friends in order to pull one heist after another of various warehouses . He seems to have thought it all out , but at the last minute , after he killed a veteran on the force and got transfered to homicide and then tries to finger a crook with a record , some small clues trip him up . . . Another compelling entry in the series that provides some added excitement of underscoring and narration by a mentor of some new recruits about Nordell with a lesson to them at the end . Well worth seeking out for anyone interested in these vintage stuff .
455244	11228318	1248337	9.0	Apollo , Apollo was another very funny episode of " 30 Rock "	In this episode , Liz is visited by former " sex partner " Dennis who's trying to make amends for his behavior . She then finds out on Jenna's phone that Dennis had sex with her as well . Having accomplished almost everything on his list since his 10th birthday , Jack wants the excitement of that childhood back in a bad way . And Tracy wants to fulfill his own dream of going into space . . . How welcome to see Dean Winters back as Dennis ( not to mention as Charlie on the next to last episode of " Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles " this season ) ! This particular episode of " 30 Rock " was very funny from beginning to end especially the way Kenneth sees everybody he encounters as Muppets ! And hearing Liz impersonate Jenna as British on Jenna's phone to Dennis and then Jenna explaining that she lost her virginity to the My Fair Lady soundtrack was a clever touch . And then there's this commercial Liz did for a phone sex line in Chicago . And how about that Adam West cameo . . .
454344	11228318	1245068	9.0	Samson and Delilah was a nearly excellent start for the second season of " Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles "	In a wonderful silent slo-mo sequence scored with a song by Garbage , we see Cameron wake up after the explosion in the van and , after we see Sarah and John take care of their kidnappers , Cameron sees them and as we cut to her point-of-view , the words she sees says , " MISSION : TERMINATE " ! That was a great shock for me as John and his mom rush out and drive . There's another great sequence in the middle when , as Cameron is smashed between John's and Sarah's trucks , she unemotionally declares her love for John as he tries to take her chip out before succeeding . Also compelling were the scenes Charlie had with both that FBI agent and Derek Reese . And then there's Shirley Manson , lead singer of the beginning scene's song , playing Catherine Weaver who turns out to be a very formidable enemy indeed ! If you know about the villain in T2 , you'll surely know what Weaver is capable of ! I wish the computer I watched this episode on had a louder volume . ( the power in our house was off when this aired due to Hurricane Gustav ) Other than that , this was a very enjoyable start for the second season of " Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles " .
454004	11228318	123099	9.0	Happy New Year , Charlie Brown ! was another fine animated " Peanuts " holiday special	Well , New Year's Eve is coming up but poor Charlie Brown is stuck with having to read " War and Peace " ( which is about a thousand pages ) for his school book report . On top of that , Peppermint Patty invites him for her and Marcie's party while Linus tries to avoid Sally and her calling him her " Sweet Baboo " . Oh , and there's a certain " Little Red Haired Girl " that Charlie's crazy about . . . Another funny and insightful " Peanuts " special with a wonderful script by creator Charles Schulz , direction by Sam Jaimes and usual helmer Bill Melendez , and a not bad musical score by Ed Bogas and Desiree Goyette who also wrote a couple of songs as well as sang on one of them . Too bad no one thought to put the late Vince Guaraldi's " Linus and Lucy " in there but otherwise , this was another fine " Peanuts " holiday special .
453906	11228318	36874	10.0	Goldilocks and the Jivin ' Bears is one more " Censored 11 " cartoon I'd recommend	This is the last of the Warner Bros . " Censored 11 " cartoons I've seen on Thad's Animation Blog and what a cartoon to watch as the final entry since it has hot jazz music performed by the title character animals , the Big Bad Wolf from Red Riding Hood ( who's off riveting ) , Goldilocks wearing out the Wolf from jitterbugging with him , likewise with the returning Red Riding Hood and her Grandma ( with voice by Dorothy Dandridge's mom , Ruby ) . In fact , the story starts with the instruments that the bears are playing ( clarinet , piano , and bass ) all literally getting red hot from rehearsing too much ! So they all take a walk while both the Wolf and Goldilocks go inside . While nearly all of the characters have African-American features , only the piano-playing bear has the stereotyped face , voice , and characterization ( of the Stepin Fetchit kind ) . And with Friz Freling at the helm , you know you're in for an animated musical treat . In fact , Goldilocks and the Jivin ' Bears seems like one of the least offensive of the " Censored 11 " cartoons I've seen here . It's certainly way better than the worst one , Angel Puss . So on that note , I highly recommend this short for animation buffs and jazz music lovers .
455145	11228318	1054848	10.0	Fight or Flight is another excellent episode of " Heroes "	With Molly in a coma , Matt vows to find his father who made her that way . When he gets to the station , Nathan's still there confronting him about his mother . Matt promises no harm to his mother and tells him about his journey . Nathan wants to come along and won't take a " no " . When they arrive there , Matt is reluctant to knock so Nathan does . He also tells Matt to treat his father , who he hasn't seen in 25 years , as just another suspect . Matt does his duty and arrests him then , in trying to read his mind , finds out Dad has the same power . In fact , after he leads his son to a secret room , which Nathan later follows in , his powers are a little more advanced in that he can project Matt and Nathan's worst fears in their heads with Matt confronting his ex with a baby she says is theirs and Nathan confronting his bloody self climaxing in them fighting each other with Matt's dad long gone ! In New Orleans at work , after talking to the police and lying about not knowing the attacker's face , Monica goes home to find Micah playing the piano . Then , without knowing it , she suddenly copies his skills with a quicker pace ! This frightens her but Micah puts her at ease when he reveals his skills with the TV . So she tests her skills by doing the " Double-Dutch " jumping rope she couldn't do before . She succeeds . Ando goes to a scientist to help clear some characters on an ancient parchment left by Hiro from the 17th century Japan . Hiro had remained to help find Tekezo's girl's father . The last part is really difficult to read so now Ando wonders if Hiro is still alive . Feeling he has no other choice , Mohinder takes Molly to the Company's headquarters to have her taken care of there . As he talks to his superior , Niki as Jessica storms in and tries to kill the superior whose name is Bob . Mohinder tazers her and then later tries to get her to escape but Niki really wants to stay in order to get cured . Bob gives Mohinder an assignment which leads him to New Orleans where Monica answers the door . It's during all this time that Noah on the phone , who's with the Hatian in Odessa , Ukraine , ( not Texas like I thought last week ) warns Mohinder what the Company is capable of . In Cork , Ireland where Peter and Kate share some intimate time , Peter looks into his box and finds some plane tickets to Montreal . He then looks in Kate's canvas and paints a picture of two men at the doorway under some street signs there . Also , a mysterious woman named Elle ( Kristen Bell ) is looking for Peter . She's revealed to have powers of lightning coming out of her hands which Peter also had the last few episodes . When she confronts Kate's brother Ricky at the bar , Ricky claims he's never seen Peter but Elle had already talked to others ( including the one who tried to kill Rick the previous week ) who had seen him and locks the door before she does her deed . So when Kate finds out about it , she's in tears as Peter tries to console her and vows vengeance . . . Wow , another exciting episode of Heroes has come and gone ! Loved the editing of the Nathan / Matt fight in which Matt was supposedly fighting a guard from jail and Nathan was supposedly his bloody self . Also loved the Monica / Micah bonding . Looks like Peter is getting out of Ireland with maybe Kate in tow . How is Mohinder going to fare in New Orleans with Monica and Micah ? And just what is Noah and Hatian doing in the Ukraine ? Kristen Bell was okay in her " Heroes " debut . And was that really her " Daddy " she was talking on the phone ? Lots that and more to ponder so until next time . . .
455034	11228318	740036	10.0	Some U . S . victories abound in Midway Is East segment of Victory at Sea	After the Japanese successfully invade Singapore and the Philippines with the U . S . bases there , the Americans on another base in Midway manage to bomb many of Japan's ship carriers making the Asian country beat a hasty retreat and giving the U . S . some early victory in the second World War . . . Once again , stirring narration as well as such music from the great Richard Rodgers makes a most compelling episode in this , the fourth installment of the wonderful television documentary series Victory at Sea . For anyone very interested in a visual depiction of World War II as depicted in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans , Victory at Sea is as good a start as any .
455027	11228318	740046	10.0	The Magnetic North is another compelling Victory at Sea episode	This episode of Victory at Sea explores the battles between the Americans and the Germans over the Arctic Circle concerning the Nazi-occupied Norwegians and other like-minded nations . After the Germans ' defeat , the Japanese take their turn resulting in another long , drawn out battle . . . A more somber segment in this classic World War II documentary series is once again given excellent treatment by the narration of Leonard Graves and the appropriate music of Richard Rodgers . Spectacular battle footage and the aftermath dominates to pay tribute to the fighting men who died in honor of their country . Well worth it to anyone interested in history as it was filmed for posterity .
455058	11228318	33123	10.0	Swinging the Lambeth Walk is another unusual Len Lye animation short	Another Len Lye animated short which has paint abstracted directly on film . The music is , as usual , an excellent score for its period . It begins and ends with a silhouette of a hand with its thumb pointed up . I guess all I can say after having seen so many of these Len Lye shorts on YouTube is if you've got a taste for the unusual , or the possibly bizarre , or a collage of colors , white lines , and shadows , if you don't mind seeing something that makes you think you're in some kind of mind trip , then anything by Len Lye should be what you're looking for . Swinging the Lambeth Walk can be one of the most trippiest experiences you've ever have without taking any controlled substances . So by all means , seek this one out !
455176	11228318	533501	10.0	Buffy the Vampire Slayer : The Harvest is excellent conclusion to series pilot	This is the second part of the pilot episode that aired on the WB's last broadcast of September 17 , 2006 . In this one , The Master and his minions are trying to " harvest " lives in order to free The Master from the underground Hellmouth . We find out Jesse is now a vampire , Willow is good with computers , Cordelia's not ( I love Willow's " Push the deliver key " line to her ) , Harmony ( Mercedes McNab ) is Cordelia's friend here , and minion Luke ( Brian Thompson ) is not too bright ( another favorite line , " It's about nine hours , moron " from Buffy after tricking Luke to look through a broken glass window with the sun shining ) . The final line from Giles , " The earth is doomed " after Willow , Xander , and Buffy joke about possible ways Buffy could get kicked out of school makes this the perfect beginning of this wonderful comedy-horror hybrid for the next seven years . . .
455197	11228318	11223	10.0	Get Out and Get Under is an excellent Harold Lloyd short from Hal Roach	Get Out and Get Under is Harold Lloyd's first film after an exploding accident that caused him to lose a two fingers and a thumb in one of his hands requiring him to wear a prosthetic glove in movies for the rest of his career . This is a very funny short in which Harold is hurrying to get to the theatre for his performance . Lots of hilarious scenes concerning ways to fix his car , his dealings with a kid ( Ernie " Sunshine Sammy " Morrison of the original Our Gang ) who keeps hanging around while he's working , a dog , some engineers of a train ferry the car accidentally goes on , a parade , a banana peel ( no surprise there ) , a steep hill , a water tower , a fire hydrant , a " road closed " sign , and some motorcycle cops . His leading lady is played by his eventual wife , Mildred Davis . Produced and directed by comedy mastermind Hal Roach . The music I heard in this version was provided by Vince Giordano and his Nighthawks Orchestra . Highly essential viewing for silent movie comedy fans especially those of Harold Lloyd .
454133	11228318	68359	10.0	A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving is another great Peanuts holiday special	Charlie Brown and his little sister Sally are planning to go to Grandmother's place for Thanksgiving dinner but Peppermint Patty invites herself , Marcie , and Franklin to the Browns expecting one themselves . Linus suggests making one before going to Grandma's so Snoopy and Woodstock start getting the table and chairs . As Peppermint Patty and friends arrive , she's disappointed at getting popcorn , toast , pretzels , and jellybeans instead of turkey , mashed potatoes , and pumpkin pie . Marcie apologizes on her friend's behalf before Patty also says she's sorry . Chuck's grandmother then calls and invites everyone over . . . Another great Peanuts holiday special that's as much a classic as the Great Pumpkin and Christmas one . I especially liked the " Little Birdie " song sung by the late great Peanuts score musician Vince Guaraldi . Snoopy's battle with a lawn chair during this number is the most hilarious scene in the special . As with the Christmas special , Linus recites a wonderful story of Thanksgiving's beginnings with great heart and sincerity . Unfortunately , ABC cut the scene of Snoopy and Woodstock walking to Charlie Brown's house in Pilgrim outfits and the tag of Snoopy and Woodstock pulling the wishbone with the bird falling backwards with the broken wishbone . So my rating of 10 here is based on the original unedited broadcast .
454763	11228318	87521	10.0	Jumping is one of the great animated shorts from Osamu Tezuka	Directed by Osama Tezuka , Jumping is one of the best entirely hand drawn animated shorts from the late ' 80s . After the title sequence with the credits quickly going up and down , we see point-of-view jumping shots going from the suburban neighborhood to some forests to some seascapes to over some tall city buildings to many war-torn areas to a giant mushroom cloud to hell twice with both times the devils trying to get you with their pitchfork to finally back to the beginning neighborhood where we hear a little child joyously crying , happy to be back in familiar terrain . Then the credits again jump as we fade to black . . . This short is most highly recommended to any animation fan . I first saw this in a VHS collection called The International Tournee of Animation , Volume 1 when I checked it out in the Jacksonville Public Library in the late ' 80s in that city's downtown area .
454552	11228318	51196	10.0	Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter ? is Frank Tashlin's masterpiece	First , let me mention a spoiler : Groucho Marx appears with Jayne Mansfield at the end as someone she used to know and was very much in love with . When she asks him why he never tried to kiss her , Groucho says , " I could never get that close ! " before his trademark raising-eyebrows-up-and-down . Because I knew of this beforehand , I decided to watch this on the 30th anniversary of Mr . Marx's death , which is today . Frank Tashlin has made one of the most satirical comedies of the ' 50s that makes great fun of television and the advertising industry . Tony Randall is great in the title role and Ms . Mansfield oozes both sexuality and humor in her over-the-top role . And there's a great cameo of her husband Mickey Hargitay . Kudos also to Joan Blondell , John Williams , and Henry Jones in support . Well worth seeing for anyone interested in all of the above .
454173	11228318	45095	10.0	Rock-a-Bye Bear is another great Tex Avery cartoon I just rewatched	When Federator . com linked this cartoon from YouTube and mentioned the short's premise in the blog , I had to watch this again since I remember laughing at it so much in the late ' 70s when I was a kid watching the weekday afternoon " Tom and Jerry " show where Tex Avery's Rock-a-Bye Bear was showcased . In a nutshell , Spike the bulldog has a job to watch a bear stay hibernated during winter . Trouble is , another dog wants that job and since the bear is constantly shouting about wanting complete quiet and usually wakes up at the slightest noise , that other dog does everything in his power to make sure Spike loses his job . Fortunately , Spike always finds a way to go way outside to avoid the sleeping bear's ears . . . Just as hilarious as I remembered it and that bear-voiced by Daws Butler in a Southern loud mouth tone that sounds like a bellicose Huckleberry Hound-provides some of the cartoon's highlights along with all those tricks of that other dog . All I can say after that is , if you love Tex Avery , you'll definitely love this cartoon !
455039	11228318	24380	10.0	Walt Disney's The Night Before Christmas is excellent Silly Symphony cartoon	When I was a kid growing up in the ' 70s , the only way you could see any Disney cartoons were on NBC's Sunday evening program The Wonderful World of Disney and they were usually limited to those starring Mickey Mouse , Donald Duck , Goofy , Pluto , and Chip ' n ' Dale . So I was wonderfully surprised to find on YouTube a Walt Disney Silly Symphony classic called The Night Before Christmas . Singer Donald Novis sings the beginning verses of that famous poem as we see several children sleeping and then Santa comes with his bag of toys coming to life decorating the Christmas tree . The toys are having lots of fun but while Santa plays the toy piano , the children wake up . The toys get into their boxes and Santa goes back up the chimney as all the kids unwrap their toys . The littlest one named Junior gets a cute Scottish dog as the singer croons the very last verses : " Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night . " By the way , this cartoon has a little butt cleavage with Junior that I was a bit surprised to see . I am thinking the Production Code eventually put an end to that soon enough ! Very enjoyable Silly Symphony that should put the Christmas spirit in anyone under 10 right away . Highly recommend to any Walt Disney animation buff .
454656	11228318	613748	10.0	Peter Lorre is hilarious in Jack Benny Program role	Paired on Universal VHS with the last episode ever with The Smothers Brothers . Peter Lorre is hilarious whether trying to convince Jack he's not who he's like in the movies or in the sketch in which he tries to hide his identity as a wanted man in a doctor's waiting room with Jack as one of the waiting patients and Mel Blanc as the doctor ! Joanie Sommers sings a wonderful love song that probably sold some records despite rock'n'roll already conquering the country ( and with the Beatles U . S . arrival the following year , the world ) . This was one of Mr . Lorre's last performances before his death the following year so it's a real treat seeing him with one of the most deadpan comedians ever ! By all means , check this one out !
453746	11228318	56965	10.0	Hear hilarious Mel Brooks in The Critic	After years of hearing of the short narrated by Mel Brooks as a very old man , I finally got to see The Critic on YouTube . All that abstraction and Brooks as an 81-year-old Jewish man from Russia about to die soon has got me in stitches ! And that harpsichord music ! If you've only known Brooks as the co-creator of " Get Smart " or the director of such movie classics as The Producers , The Twelve Chairs , Blazing Saddles , Young Frankinstein , and Spaceballs ( I know some might dispute the last title ) or as the 2 , 000-year-old man with straight man Carl Reiner , then I highly recommend you seek out The Critic on YouTube and hope someone puts it out on DVD soon ! Also recommended to animation buffs especially Ernie Pintoff fans .
454070	11228318	414469	10.0	Ryan is an excellent tribute of Canadian animator by Chris Landreth	When Ryan Larkin , the Canadian animator from the late ' 60s / early ' 70s died recently , Cartoon Brew paid tribute by showing Syrinx ( 1965 ) and this Oscar-winning short by Chris Landreth . It follows Landreth interviewing Larkin is a visual style that I can only describe as psychedelic with the florescent way each faces were colored and lighted . Various associates of Larkin like his longtime girlfriend Felicity comment on the artist's life and career like his troubled childhood with his father or his cocaine and alcohol addiction . Well worth seeing for various animation types of both Landreth and Larkin as displayed in clips of a couple of his shorts like Walking ( 1969 ) and Street Musique ( 1972 ) .
454722	11228318	35476	10.0	Tulips Shall Grow is another excellent George Pal " Puppetoon " short	Like a few other shorts I just reviewed , Tulips Shall Grow was another one I just discovered on the Europa Film Treasures site . George Pal directed this " Puppetoon " after he moved to the United States and started to work for Paramount . In this one , a Dutch young man and young woman are enjoying themselves among the tulips dancing before an ominous team of war soldiers called " Screwballs " ( who are literally screws with bolts for heads ) wreak havoc in planes on windmills . The tragic happenings that follow truly pack a wallop before the inevitable happy ending comes and the message " Tulips Shall Always Grow " prints on screen . Once again , Pal outdoes himself in quality which became evident when this short got an Oscar nomination . Highly recommended .
453775	11228318	31749	10.0	Porky Pig gets an education in Old Glory	I first saw this Porky Pig educational cartoon short on Buskin Bill's Storyland in the Bicentenial year of 1976 . I later saw it after James Cagney's Yankee Doodle Dandy on a Saturday night on that same channel of WAFB-9 , Baton Rouge , La . ( possibly on the 4th of July ) . Having recently seen it on YouTube , I must marvel at how bright the colors are compared to the washed-out tones I remember from way back when . Great use of having Uncle Sam telling our stuttering hero about the American Revolution and subsequent events with wonderful realistic animation throughout to make their point . Highly recommended to any child who wonders why history is so important to learn .
454153	11228318	1268073	10.0	" Interjuctions ! " is another educational , yet entertaining , animated musical short in the " Schoolhouse Rock ! " series	With lyrics by Lynn Aherne and Essra Mohawk providing the vocal , " Interjections ! " is another great short animated musical for the " Schoolhouse Rock ! " series-the three minute segment that aired after many ABC Saturday morning programs during the ' 70s and ' 80s . When a boy gets a shot in the butt ( yes , that part is depicted ) , he says , " Ouch ! " When a beautiful lady gets insulted by a man's constantly courting her , she says " Well ! " Then says , " Hey ! You're kinda cute . " And then there's a football game when the player quarterback threw the ball in the " other direction . " You hear , " Aw ! " " Darn ! " and then " Hooray ! I'm for the other team . " ( You can probably guess what humiliation the last suffers there ) Like the other " Schoolhouse Rock ! " cartoons , this one is worth showing kids today when trying to make education fun for them . And just try not to smile when the " Halleujah " girl says , " Darn , that's the end " after the song suddenly ends . . .
454857	11228318	1127389	10.0	The Grasshopper Experiment is another excellent episode of " The Big Bang Theory "	In Sheldon and Leonard's apartment , Raj Koothrappali introduces his parents on his computer screen to them and Howard Wolowitz . The parents tell their son about a grown Indian woman Raj knew previously as a fat child coming over for an arraigned marriage . Her name is Lalita ( Sarayu Rao ) . Penny comes over and asks for help in mixing drinks to prepare for her new bar tending job . In her apartment , Sheldon keeps ordering a drink with an unusual name that basically is Diet Coke while Raj , having drank her Grasshopper and had previously just whispered to his friends in order to communicate with any woman , opens up to Penny about his insecurity in meeting his future bride . When he meets Lalita later at Penny's bar , he does nothing but inadvertently insult her . Sheldon , however , when he meets her , charms her when he tells her she's the spitting image of a princess of an Indian folk tale his mother read from a book when her son as a child was often sick . Latita leaves with Sheldon which upsets a now jealous Raj . The next day , Raj tries to talk on computer screen to his upset parents alone while Sheldon reveals to Leonard that nothing romantic happened between him and Lalita . Later at the bar , Sheldon performs a " Fidler on the Roof " number on keyboard thanks to some alcohol Penny put in his Diet Coke . . . Another very funny episode of " The Big Bang Theory " that served as a nice showcase for Koothrappali and his Indian family and upbringing . Great performances from everyone here with special mention going to Ms . Rao for her great sense of humor . Now if only the writer's strike would end so this series could bloom to its full potential for the rest of the season . . .
454116	11228318	1248341	10.0	Believe in the Stars is another very funny episode of " 30 Rock "	Jenna and Tracy do a " Freaky Friday " , Jack fakes Synchronized Running during the Summer Olympics , Liz meets " Oprah " on an airplane , Kenneth has a crisis of conscience . . . . Lots of funny stuff are once again happening on " 30 Rock " what with Jenna miffed not getting compensated for her voice work on Tracy's porn video game so they turn it into a woman-vs . - black discrimination thing as they try to literally try each other's skin ( especially hilarious hearing Tracy telling how they wouldn't put some on " my butt " ) . And seeing Liz in a Princess Leia outfit with the cinnabun hair or confession to " Oprah " about her fears on an airplane in a stream-of-conscious mode is what makes Tina Fey such a comedic genius ! And seeing Kenneth actually being noble when he thinks the elevator is actually losing air . Jack McBrayer can do no wrong as far as I'm concerned ! So for that , I recommend this episode of " 30 Rock " .
454628	11228318	57339	10.0	My Financial Career is another excellent animated short from the National Film Board of Canada	Just watched on the National Film Board of Canada site , this Oscar-nominated animated short by Gerald Potterton . It's a highly amusing tale of a young man's attempt to deposit some money at a bank for the very first time . The narration and its account of the reactions of many of the bank people provides much of the deadpan quality of humor that made me laugh in small bursts that became a little bigger with each absurdity that occurs . Much of that amusement is also provided by the child-like drawings . If you love animation and its many forms , Gerald Potterton's My Financial Career is definitely one I'd recommend . I discovered this one when Warren Leonhardt linked this from the NFBC site .
454429	11228318	1139160	10.0	Carol Burnett : A Woman of Character is another great episode of " American Masters "	A few weeks ago , I watched this wonderful documentary about the life and career of one the most talented comediennes ever : Carol Burnett . From her early life growing up with her grandma watching various movies to her early live performances on " The Garry Moore Show " and Broadway to her defining moments on her 11-year classic run of her own variety program " The Carol Burnett Show " , Ms . Burnett shows us how consistently entertaining she has been over four decades . We also see clips of " Once Upon a Mattress " her breakthrough Broadway triumph as first taped in black-and-white by CBS in the early ' 60s . Among the interviewees besides Carol are , of course , many of her show's regulars : Harvey Korman , Lyle Waggoner , Vicki Lawrence , and Tim Conway . Also interviewed : costume designer Bob Mackie , Tracy Ullman-who played Carol's role in the recent version of " Once Upon a Mattress " with Ms . Burnett playing the mean queen , Richard Kind-who appeared on a couple of failed attempts at reviving Carol's variety show , Garry Shandling-who had Burnett as a guest on " The Larry Sanders Show " , old friend Florence Henderson , Carl Reiner-a frequent guest on Carol's show , and many others I can't remember right now . One of the most valuable of clips here is one from " The Garry Moore Show " when Ms . Burnett first did a fall on live television : It was Neil Simon sketch with Carol as Jill who follows Jack after he falls out of a hospital window . After Carol did her fall on a mattress , she revealed to us she gasped a sign of relief which revealed to everyone within earshot she had never done this thing before contrary to what she told the producers . We then see her take several falls afterward in quick clips which shows how expert she became on this sort of thing . Also shown are clips of her movies like Pete ' n ' Tillie and Annie . For Carol fans , I highly recommended this to them as well as anyone curious about this great lady's versatility and attitude as well as entertainment ability !
454271	11228318	443706	10.0	Zodiac was an excellent drama about the search for a real-life serial killer	When my dad decided to watch Zodiac , he asked if I wanted to join him . I agreed to even though the movie was 162 min . I was so enthralled I didn't care about the length after a while . Director David Fincher provides the most compelling drama of this real-life serial killer despite most of the scenes leading to several false leads and one man's complete obsession to get the right man . Jake Gyllenhaal is that obsessed man , a cartoonist named Robert Graysmith whose Eagle Scout demeanor leads to his determination of finding what makes this killer tick to the point of following reporter Paul Avery's ( Robert Downey , Jr . ) files and later browbeating police inspector David Toschi's ( Mark Ruffalo ) time . This then leads to a strained marriage with Melanie ( Chloe Sevigny ) . Also of note are performances of Anthony Edwards ( Inspector William Armstrong ) , John Caroll Lynch ( suspect Arthur Leigh Allen ) , Brian Cox ( lawyer Melvin Belli ) , Richmond Arquette , Bob Stephenson , and John Lacey ( other Zodiac killer suspects ) . The whole thing just enthralled me from beginning to end and I especially was on the edge of my seat when Graysmith visited this man's house who used to work at a theatre where a Zodiac suspect was a projectionist . So on that note , I highly recommend David Fincher's Zodiac .
455107	11228318	148507	10.0	My Daddy the Astronaut is one of the best of the Shamus Culhane-directed cartoons from Paramount cartoon studios	Just watched this Paramount Fractured Fable on YouTube . Made in the waning days of the Famous / Paramount cartoon studios , this Shamus Culhane-directed cartoon was unique in that it was basically done in a style of a child's crayon drawing as animated by Al Eugster . With accompaniment from Winston Sharples ' harmonica and an unknown child's narration , this was a very amusing tale of one boy's father who becomes an astronaut after initially flying planes and then after all those physical test rides and the spaceship journey without any sickness involved , when he takes his son to a carnival the dizziness starts ! That's all I'll say except how the irony continues as the boy keeps mentioning how fine he is during the rides while his dad keeps getting sicker and sicker ! So on that note , I highly recommend My Daddy the Astronaut .
453802	11228318	1035913	10.0	Chuck Versus the Nemesis is the funniest action-packed episode of " Chuck " yet !	This episode takes place on Thanksgiving and Black Friday the next day so I'll just mention some tidbits here : With Bryce now revealed to be alive , Chuck gets in the interrogation room with him and has to prove he's the real one to Bryce by talking in Klingon which he's rusty at . At Ellie's Thanksgiving dinner , Anna shows jealousy at seeing Morgan's looks at Ellie as well as the way he's REALLY enjoying her food . Chuck also is envious watching secretly Sarah and Bryce ( who's unbeknownst to everyone else ) kissing in his bedroom , so much so he's tells Casey in encoded form about it . Chuck says " pineapple " to warn his fellow employees of an emergency as he's being held up by some enemy agents threatening to kill everyone in sight . Morgan awkwardly seeing Bryce and saying how he reminds him of Chuck's old roommate who he thinks is a " douche " . And then seeing Jeff hit on the head a couple of times after revealing how he liked being hit by a pineapple by his dad during his childhood . The episode ends with Sarah having to choose between two calls : One from Bryce on a classic antique phone made for mansions or on her ipod phone from Chuck . What to pick ? . . . Most hilarious and action-packed of " Chuck " yet ! With all my favorite characters and thousands of soccer mom shoppers contributing to the fun ! Very glad to know NBC gave this one a full-season pickup . Hope the writers ' strike ends before the episodes run out .
