549112	1111192	52286	1.0	Not much terror from 5000 , let me tell ya .	The movies title is a bit misleading in that there isn't much terror in this movie . In fact , there isn't much of anything going on till the last maybe 20 minutes of this flick . A museum curator gets a mysterious statue and is asked to test it for its age . Somehow he finds out it comes from the future . I don't know if I am right on this point , but I don't believe you can tell if something comes from the future . . . only how old something is . Well , he also finds out it is highly radioactive so he goes to this professor's house where the statue came from . There the professor and his extremely stupid assistant are doing , of course , time travel experiments . Since the statue was radioactive the professor wants to stop the experiments for the time being , but the stupid assistant wants to keep going . His fianc√© eventually goes with the curator and the assistant summons a mutant from the year 5000 , which kills people for no reason and then convinces the assistant to go with her to the year 5000 and help out their people . She steals a nurse's face before this and uses it as a mask as she is a bit mutated . All in all a pretty lousy sci-fi flick that has so many inaccuracies it is pathetic .
548704	1111192	77834	1.0	Pointless	That is the best way to describe Laserblast . This movie just is nothing . It is about a kid who for some reason is picked on by cops and two dorks , guy finds laser gun and gets revenge . That is about all there is to it . Meanwhile they throw in a couple of plot points that are never worked out in the movie . The kids mom goes on a vacation or something and the kid seems to have issues with this , but it isn't used in the rest of the film . You have a stranger in town who flashes some sort of badge , but you never find out what agency he works for or why he even knows how to search for aliens in the town . Then there are the stupid looking aliens made out of clay . I could design better creatures than that . Then there is the pointless cameo of Roddy McDowell and I am guessing he probably took most of the budget of the film . And enough people have talked about the Star Wars sign blowing up . Anyway if you want to see a plotless movie about a green faced kid stumbling around and blowing up random objects then this is your flick .
548874	1111192	110978	1.0	This one almost made me not watch the first .	This movie is so horrible that I almost never watched the first one . I finally broke down though and watched the first one and loved it . This one though is just bad . . . as it mainly involves Renee being terrorized by Matthew . That is basically all you see . It sort of mirrors the first one , but then it doesn't . In that one Leatherface was an important character . . . here he is a cross dresser . Matthew who is playing the hitchhiker role from the first one is the main attraction and it just doesn't equal all that much terror this time around . I don't think a single person was killed with a chainsaw , unless it happened within the first 10 or so minutes that I missed before tuning in . My advice is skip this one and don't even watch it until you have seen the first one . If you want to see it after that it is up to you cause there are some positive reviews to be found for this one . For me , though , this one was awful .
549046	1111192	60753	1.0	Griffin , Landis , and Cook have no idea what they are doing .	This is the most jumbled movie I have ever seen . It is badly edited , grainy , and the acting is bad . It also seems to have no story whatsoever . It apparently centers around three guys : one an escaped convict ( Griffin ) , and the other two excons ( Landis and Cook ) . They ride the countryside getting into all these stupid and avoidable situtions . How they got suckered into going to Cuba is anyone's guess . And I wonder are we supposed to be rooting for these guys . I mean they mercilessly throw one guy down a well . Oh well what can you expect . There is a suprise at the end , but the guys of MST 3000 said not to reveal it .
548766	1111192	69969	1.0	Sorry , but an adult film should not make one go ewwww .	Yes , this film gets a lot of attention and is considered a classic in the adult film genre . Still , I did not like this one at all . About a woman who commits suicide in a scene more fitting a horror movie , she is given the opportunity to return to earth briefly to live the life of lust she never did before in her mundane life . Crappy sex scenes to follow . Why are they crappy , for one they try so hard to be artistic that they take away from the actual sex act . I mean we watch porn for the sex do we not . Little Girls Blue also does things in an artistic way , but it is still very erotic and nice to look at . Of course the girls in that one are very cute . Here we have a rather unattractive lead actress and that does not help things . If you find the lead in your adult film unappealing there is no amount of artistic vision that is going to make me enjoy the film . The sex scenes range from yuck to bizarre . . . I mean there is a snake in one of them people . So for me this movie just fails as it does not excite me at all , but rather turns me off .
548911	1111192	55294	1.0	The phantom planet looks like it is extra crispy	Yes , this is the movie about a mysterious planet that looks a lot like a piece of chicken , extra crispy . . . not original recipe . The plot is a space craft disappears so another one is sent out to find what happened . Well they find a planet . . . one crew member dead the other lands on the planet . There he shrinks down in size when his mask opens and there is a small review of the movie up to that point . What he finds as a small guy is a race of people who really want him to stay to the point of offering him two women to choose from . Well our hero will have none of that , as he wants to go home no matter what , so he disrupts these people's way of life . He argues a lot with one guy who doesn't like the women of the planet swoon over the new boy . . . so they fight by holding a bike rack between them and try to force each other on a tile that can kill . Meanwhile , these dog aliens attack in ships that are on fire and a whole bunch of stuff happens and later we get to see a recap of the entire movie . All in all this is one to avoid , except on MST3k .
548880	1111192	58007	1.0	Hugo you are a ugly dummy who can't eat ham !	This movie is about a great ventriloquist who has the worst act imaginable , yet for some reason he performs in front of sold out crowds . He basically makes people uncomfortable and people pay to see him do this and to argue with his dummy about luncheon meat and wine . The doll has a secret though and it is up to William Sylvester to find out what and this isn't exactly exciting to watch either . Some how the dummy is alive containing the soul of a former employee of The Great Vorelli ( the ventriloquist ) . There is one murder in this one , but for the most part it is just Vorelli talking down to Hugo ( the dummy ) and putting the moves on Sylvester's girlfriend by hypnotizing her to like him . We also see a lot of Vorelli's assistants butt . What gets me is that Sylvester's character suspects Vorelli of wrongdoing , but when his girlfriend says she wants to marry Vorelli he just accepts it and walks away . All in all a rather drab picture to watch , but the ending is rather funny .
548162	1111192	92074	2.0	A really lame attempt at comedy horror .	This movie is just what the plot outline says . A family gets a new satellite system and it picks up a transmission from another planet . Unfortunately for them this transmission is in fact a really stupid looking monster . That is the first part of the film . Next , is the monster knocking off the family members one by one except for the brother and sister , then the monster turns friendly for a bit and finally it goes on a final rampage . This movie is really quite bad and lame . Most of the comedy falls on its face and there really is no horror to speak of . It is almost a pure comedy and when the jokes don't work , neither does the movie . Though one joke made me almost die laughing and in retrospect it was not all that funny . The scene where the boy and his grandfather are watching television and the monster appears on the screen and the grandfather is yelling at the screen telling it to do something . I don't know why I laughed so hard at that , but that was about it . The ending was also quite bad , though the movie did have a rather catchy song to it .
548290	1111192	100116	2.0	I can not believe this was based on a novel .	The movie is rather bad and an unfunny comedy . The story , man has this song he writes and plays , somehow this song is like an invitation to Martians , the title characters . These characters are basically annoying , obnoxious , and dreadfully unfunny . And guess what ? They are the whole point of the film and drag the movie down with them . So most of the movie is the humans trying to get rid of them and then accepting them when the one guy who summoned them finally figures out how to get rid of them . Rob Snieder I think is one of the Martians , however , most of them are all the same . Rather indistinct , painted green and doing the same bit as all the others . Randy Quaid plays the lead guy , the one who did the accidental invitation . He also has the most problem with said aliens , as they are extremely irritating it makes one wonder who other characters seem to not have a problem with them . The magically appear at very awkward times and proceed to ruin intimate moments and any moment they are in . All this and this movie is supposed to be a comedy and it is highly unfunny .
548170	1111192	58208	2.0	Horror at Fingle's Quarry !	This is a movie that starts out as one long beach party then the rest has really nothing to do with the beach . Radioactive waste is the culprit here . It causes dead skeletons to look like horrible monsters with hot dogs stuck in their mouths . What is really interesting is this radioactive waste can reanimate something that has been dead for a long time , but has absolutely no immediate effects on the fish just swimming around . Meanwhile , on the beach a couple who apparently have nothing in common are heading to the beach . They are having a rough patch so he goes to another gal and his girlfriend starts stripping with a biker gang . The dude gets angry at this for some reason and fights the leader of the gang and of course wins . The girlfriend proceeds to swim out to sea ( I am guessing to get away from the horrible band's music ) and is the first victim of the monsters . The gal the man was talking to while his girlfriend was stripping moves in before the ex-girlfriend's body is even cold . The beach is only in one more scene as the monsters kill New York ladies , a slumber party , two drunks , and various others . The hero's take their time finding the monsters saving the most obvious place to look for them last and the gal trips and falls . You know the same ol same ol .
548253	1111192	88206	2.0	Good choice for Supergirl , but the plot is not good .	This is one painful movie to watch . The only character to cross over from Superman is the guy who played Jimmy Olsen and you can see why no one else would want to be seen in this one . They seem to change a lot of things around that were clearly established in the Superman series and then there is the horrible plot as well . Supergirl played by Helen Slater who is probably a good choice to play the role must retrieve a ball that keeps her people alive in inner space or something . All I know is that Supergirl somehow gets to earth by way of a lake . The ball falls into the hands of Faye Dunaway who somehow knows how to use it and she does all sorts of evil things as she is trying to get a younger guy to like her ( kind of desperate , eh ? ) . She somehow even sends Supergirl to the phantom zone . . . in Superman it was a mirror in space ; here it is an entire world . All in all this one just suffers from a really bad script and very bad overacting as well . I have only seen the original theatrical release however , and not the 140 minute cut which may explain a few of my complaints .
548466	1111192	97371	3.0	Just giant rats in this one .	In the first one it was mainly giant rats , but there were some wasps and a giant chicken too . This one , however , is just giant rats period , well giant rats and one really growing little boy . This one is about this growing boy and a scientist that is trying to help him so he accidentally creates giant killer rats . . . you know how it is . This movie has some kills and its moments , but I find it to be on par with the original , I just prefer some variety in my giant creature movies . Well , that is not true . . . I actually like " Empire of the Ants " , maybe I just do not care for giant rodents . All in all a rather drab movie though it does have one rather odd turn of events in this one dream sequence that is truly bizarre . I just can't recommend this one .
548677	1111192	93756	3.0	The worst of the bunch for me .	Of the Police Academy movies the worst of the bunch for me is the final movie in the series to star Steve Guttenberg as Mahoney . The jokes are the same , the cast is the same the only difference here is they are training citizens to help fight crime in a neighborhood watch type deal . Mauser is gone , replace once again by Harris and I liked Mauser better as he and Proctor to me worked better . Bobcat is back which is bad , as is most of the jokes in this very forgettable movie . Seriously , other than a plot point or two here and there it is very hard to recall this movie other than I did not care for it except for when Proctor ends up letting a whole slew of criminals escape and we have our typical Police Academy ending . I also remember the end with a hot air balloon and Harris . This one also tries to introduce new characters to the gang one overweight dude and an older lady stands out in my mind and for some reason in the next movie the overweight guy would be a cop which makes no sense .
548301	1111192	74285	3.0	Teenage comes of age flick .	This story is of Carrie , a girl who is picked on to the ridicules extreme right at the beginning of the movie . The girls who pick on her are punished and one goes to the extreme to get revenge on the girl who had nothing really to do with her getting into trouble . This one is so much like a typical day at a high school that it is boring . Of course Carrie has a secret . . . her mom's psycho . So when the teacher tells her about the problems Carrie has at school , she proceeds to beat Carrie and tell her how evil she is . You just know she has a complex . Carrie also has special powers too . So a nice girl lets Carrie go to the prom with her boyfriend , the bad girl dumps something on Carrie at prom and all heck breaks loose . This film is just too mundane in some areas for it to be interesting . Nothing you see is really all that revolutionary here . . . teens have been this way to each other forever . The only thing interesting , or that is a new wrinkle is the powers and the really horrific prom , which for me just isn't enough to save the flick , but I can see why others like it . It just isn't for me .
548945	1111192	144528	3.0	You basically saw the funny stuff in the commercials .	Usually , you will have one are two funny scenes that are totally unexpected in a comedy that you don't even see a hint of in the commercial . For this movie if you seen the barrage of previews for this commercial , then you have seen all the funniest scenes period . By the time I saw this at the theater the scenes were very stale as they repeated the commercials so much it was pathetic . This one has a bit more of the family in it , which was the highlight of the first one . To bad they are not as funny in larger doses . The plot has Sherman somehow extracting the part of him that is Buddy Love . This form somehow comes to life on its own and starts wrecking havoc . This was such an awful plot device you wonder why it is even there . Why have Buddy Love return , is it just to show the audience that Eddie Murphy is actually in shape or what ? This movie also has to many scenes where it takes itself to seriously and gets to sappy . What is the matter with just having a comedy without the tender moments ? Tender moments are not what I go to a comedy to see most of the time and this is a movie I was expecting none . If you saw the many advertisements of this one , don't bother . . . you have seen all the funniest parts . If you haven't seen much on it , you may want to give it a go .
548178	1111192	91993	3.0	Kids shot into space thanks to the homicidal Jinx .	Yes , this movie has kids going to space camp and it starts out okay enough as you have the kids meeting one another and learning the ropes . Then they introduce Jinx , a robot that could not possibly exist in 1986 as they do not have anything with that kind of artificial intelligence now . Kid becomes buddy with robot and robot repays the kid's kindness by shooting him and a group of other kids in this camp into outer space with a very limited oxygen supply and radios that do not have the signal to reach into space . This camp is also not very fun as these kids are put to real training and the instructors get all over them for failing missions or not doing the right things . Give it a rest , they are there for fun , not to become astronauts just yet , just give them the experience of space flight not a military like camp . However , you do get to see Joaquin Phoenix in a fairly early role . So in the end a movie that tries to be realistic in some areas , but with the introduction of Jinx and other factors you might as well had the kids battle space aliens on top of everything else that was happening in the movie as that would have made the movie a bit more enjoyable at least for me . Probably for a few others as well , who else would like to see Kate Capshaw's face ripped apart by some strange super alien creature .
548649	1111192	174685	3.0	Oh , baby shake that booty !	This film would have been totally awful if not for the dance sequences ( not that they are good dancers , but they look pretty good doing it ) . The plot at the beginning of this is apparently not important to the viewers of this movie . This guy goes into a diner called " eat " to rob the place , but then decides to take the girl working there to California . You think he is the star and hero of the movie , but then the movie throws a curve and this hitchhiker becomes the hero . There are a bunch of random scenes that have no importance and the editing is so bad at one point even I notice it ( The hitchhiker and the girl are talking and the other guy just pops into the scene drinking his beer ) . The last half of the movie has some semblance of a plot involving the girls dancing career and the guy you thought was the hero selling drugs . You wonder if Critter ( that is the hitchhiker ) can save the day . Not really , but I thought I would make it sound suspenseful . Oh , and if you watch it and you can figure it out could you please tell me how that one guy got out of the prison ?
548768	1111192	376109	3.0	Was it possible to win this game ?	This game brought about many nightmares and hours of play as a child trying desperately to win what I still have no clue on how to win . I hear some people say they won it and you basically see the scene right at the beginning in reverse . You are basically Indy , you pick up the whip right at the beginning and you can choose to fight wave after wave of snakes with said whip or you can go to the market and maybe by a grenade or parachute or something . You can even find a revolver in a garbage can . You can use said grenade to blow a hole in the screen with the snakes and go through a level with no dangers and some sort of clock to a room that is apparently cliffs , a strange marsh with the strangest looking spider ever , to a room where you get trapped in boxes . You have a treasure room beyond the room with the boxes . You have a strange land below the cliffs where a man in black roams , the black market , a strange area with a mound of dirt that just takes you back to the cliffs , the map room that shows nothing even when you have the staff of ra , the black market which has more snakes and how any of this ties in together is beyond me .
548148	1111192	156706	3.0	Disregard the plot line given here , this is not really much of a zombie flick .	First of all this movie is not really Zombie 5 as someone pointed out Zombie 4 After Death came out a year later . Rather , both movies are just being repackaged and given new names simply to make some connection to Fulcio's Zombi 2 . The only thing they have in common is that the dead do rise . I liked After Death a little , I thought it was a nice little zombie flick , nothing super great , but worth a look . This one , however , was really kind of tedious . Started promisingly enough with a man going on a killing spree after he finds his wife in bed with another man , but then it almost turns into a teen flick as we are introduced to the rest of the cast . The music even makes it seem like a teen comedy . Oh , and though it really is not clear at all there has been a significant number of years that has passed since the killings . Well we meet our young group of bird watchers and one annoying bus driver and a rather unremarkable reporter and all you can think is I hope they all die in extremely horrible ways . Not a good way to establish your characters in a horror movie is it ? I mean when they aren't arguing over stupid stuff they are mumbling their lines so badly they sound like the parents in a Charlie Brown cartoon . Well they set off to find a bird which has not been seen in 20 or so years , and they run across a blind bird watcher . You'll know who he is and you will know what one of the gang of teens is right away so there is no real surprise at the revelation at the end . Well after they bother the blind guy they proceed to go bird watching get lost in the woods and find a house . They immediately set up camp here , despite the fact there vehicle is like just over the hill and if they would have continued searching for another 5 minutes they could have gotten out without anything happening . But hey , its a horror movie . Well finally some stuff starts to happen as people begin to die while their friends just stand there watching the person die . Of course they don't offer to help just standing there like idiots and then reacting well after the fact when it is far to late . My favorite being the guy who gets caught in a generator gear and gets ground up while this moron stands there not offering to help , then after the guy has had it he runs up stairs and says " they got him " . I had to say , no they didn't the jerk got caught and you kind of let him die . As for the zombies they aren't in this movie much and they don't make much of an impression . The plot is practically nonexistent as there is no explanation for why any of it is happening besides the blind man's explanation at the end . Then you expect a rather grisly conclusion , but it never materializes and it just ends . Not a real zombie movie I say the makers were trying to make a movie more in the vain of " The Beyond " . Of course that movie looks better , sounds better , and has better kills so there is no comparison there . I don't know maybe this was two movies that got bumped together . One film crew was making a horror movie , the other a teen romance , but they ran into each other and the teen romance people thought , a horror movie cool . That would explain the strange changes in the music in the first thirty minutes or so .
548503	1111192	90917	3.0	Just use your imagination and don't over think it . . . and it is still bad .	I have not seen this one in quite some time , but it is about a new kid in town and his pet robot . A robot designed to grab people by the crotch and squeeze . Already , you see the flaws ; he apparently designed this robot to have a bit of a violent streak in him . Young new boy makes a new friend a girl who has an abusive father . You can see where this is going . The old lady from " The Goonies " and " Throw Momma from the Train " blows the heck out of the robot and the girl is killed by her abusive father . Young boy somehow deduces that if you put the robot's computer chip in the young girl she will come back and she does . Unfortunately , she now seemingly has the robot's personality and that isn't too good . All the deaths you see coming , though the one with the basketball is rather good , in fact the highlight of this overly predictable movie . The only thing that is not predictable is the end which makes no sense . Well you know what happens , I am just saying by that time the kid should have left well enough alone . It is also a rather impossible phenomenon , but hey it is a horror movie .
548528	1111192	63172	4.0	Not as good as it should have been .	Seems the more monsters they feature in a Godzilla movie the less time the monsters are actually on screen . This one once again has aliens trying to take over earth with monsters . . . a whole lot of monsters . Some we have seen before ( Godzilla being one of the main ones ) and a few we haven't ( some weird snake looking thing ) . All in all though this movie bogs down more than once as it seems it would rather focus on the people rather than the monsters . In one scene we are treated to these guys using some laser beam to cut something and the scene goes on and on . They show what the laser is cutting , they show the device , then they show the guy cutting and this goes on for a good bit . At the end though there is an all out monster attack as we regain control of the monsters , but it isn't much fun as it has poor King Gidorah squaring off against way to many monsters , they really should have given him an ally to help him . . . unfortunately , Gigan and MechaGodzilla had not come into being yet .
548196	1111192	118688	4.0	Why did they make it so campy ? ? ?	This could have been a good movie , but Joel Shuemauker really botched up . The only reason I gave this movie a 4 on the 10 rating is I liked the first ten or so minutes of action , then it was just a boring , goofy movie . To me it looks like they followed the same blueprint as they did for Batman forever , but added more gags . Arnold would have been perfect for Mr . Freeze if they portrayed him the way the cartoon series did , as an emotionless killer who wanted revenge on those who killed his wife . Instead we get Arnold saying the most stupid one-liners I have ever heard " Tonights forecast , a hard freeze " . O'Donnel as Robin was really annoying this time too . He was a whiny pain , instead of a help to Batman , and Silverstone was bad too . I mean in the comic , in the stupid tv show , and in the cartoon she is Commissioner Gordon's daughter , now she is Alfred's niece ? And she races bikes , does this give people super crime fighting skills ? I loved the first one , thought the second was ok , and liked the third , but it is time to change the costume . I mean I don't see how the bad guys keep losing considering how constricting the costume is . Thanks to this most of the fight scenes fall flat . There are more problems but I won't go into them all .
548787	1111192	97388	4.0	So you can get to New York by way of Crystal Lake , eh ?	This movie has some moments , but overall for me it was disappointing . . . went to the theater to see this one and I was expecting to see Jason in New York , well you do for fifteen or so minutes . The rest of the carnage takes place on a boat heading for New York . This entry is kind of devoid of the gore and graphic nudity you would expect from a Friday the 13th movie and that doesn't help it any . There are also quite a few flaws as well . I just don't see a boat somehow getting to New York from where they started out . I don't believe Crystal lake was that close to the Atlantic .
548672	1111192	93516	4.0	Well it is the summer I guess .	Yes , it being the summer is the only thing that remotely ties this film to the first two movies . That being said I did enjoy this movie more than part two , however , you can see by my score of four that I still did not like this movie overall . It had potential and I think its low score here of 2 . 8 has a lot to do with the fact it tries to pass itself off as a sequel to a set of movies it has nothing remotely in common with . However , that being said overall it was still a poor comedy with the typical teen sex comedy plot . . . guy wants to lose virginity . The twist , a ghost of a porn star must try and help him . Of course , my question is why does he need help ? He is pals with a cute girl who would obviously be more than willing to have sex with him , I mean she is watching a porno with him . Still , if it were that easy there would be no movie . However , that may have been a good thing in this case . Still , it has a couple of good comedy moments and far less groan inducing humor than part two ( though it has its fair share as well ) . So there you have it , we go from family oriented comedy to a teen sex romp in three films .
548268	1111192	492680	4.0	Fighting game that needs more marvel characters and a better story mode .	This games cover made it look like an extremely well done game . Add to that a nice opening sequence as invaders have come to destroy earth and some of earth's mightiest heroes have already fallen . In the end it disappoints with to much focus on the Imperfects and not enough on the marvel characters especially in the end . I like to be able to play a game without inviting the gang over to play and as a single player game this one will keep you entertained for a bit , but not over the long haul . The fighting is easy to pick up and I love the fact that the characters are not the same strength , but why such a limited number of characters ? Sure we get Spider-man , Wolverine , Venom , Daredevil and more to choose from , however the marvel universe is so expansive you could have had twice the number of marvel characters and still had the three they choose to knock out of action early . This game could have won me over also with multiple endings , but it doesn't go the only route that could have saved it . Instead the ending rushes at you with one lame character you have to win with . . . why not have it so you decide who win's the game and save the day ? That would have given this game so much more reply value . In the end an okay fighter with some of your favorite marvel characters and some new characters who often mirror one of the marvel ones .
548833	1111192	95179	4.0	Apparently the authorities in the county refuse to drag the lake for any reason .	Yes , this movie pits Jason against a gal with telekinetic powers . Kind of a Jason v . Carrie scenario . In fact , from Friday the 13th 7 to Jason X , all the Fridays have been basically what if movies . This is what if Jason fought Carrie , the next is what if Jason went to New York , the one after that what if Jason was a body snatching alien , and finally what if Jason was in space . This one just isn't very good at all . Then again I am not the biggest fan of the series . I thought 3 , 4 , and 6 were pretty good , but most of the others aren't very fun to watch . Here somehow the telekinetic girl raises Jason out of the lake where he was chained up in part six . Apparently the authorities didn't feel like taking the body out of the rather small lake . They apparently have a history of not taking bodies out though as this gal's dad is in there too ( this is who the girl wanted to revive ) . There are some killings and finally a showdown between the girl and Jason with a really lame conclusion .
548799	1111192	93075	4.0	Had potential .	This movie could have been a lot better . . . it had the potential to be , but ultimately I found it a tad weak . It is pg-13 so it never really gets to horrific . The story revolves around a tree that is pulled up and the hole is covered up . Two boys dig in and find a geode . Through a set of strange coincidences they actually perform a bunch of acts that when done all together open the gate to hell . The other main character is the main boy's sister and both he and she like firing rocket fire works and this is emphasized way too much in this one . There is a party and a sleep over that goes wrong as the minions of hell are released as little demons . The highlight in this one is where the zombie construction worker falls down . All in all this one could have been good if they had gone for an r rating and maybe explained a few plot points , but as it is it isn't very good . Though it is very tolerable to watch because of a very short running time .
548207	1111192	89686	5.0	Rather dull sequel to Nightmare .	It had its moments for the most part , but in the end it was a rather dull movie . It did have Freddy act dark and scary still , unlike later episodes where he was a comedian , but alas he wasn't in this one all that much . What gets me is that this movie is said to have a lot of gay elements . Really ? I only saw the movie a few times as a kid so I guess I couldn't pick them up , so I can't really comment on them . Though I do remember the main character Jesse had a girlfriend who tries to save him . The trouble I had with this movie as a kid is that it is a bit boring as there aren't many dream sequences in this one and it isn't as menacing as the first one . What passes for horror here . . . a bird escaping and going crazy ? No , this one just doesn't have the style and atmosphere the first one did . The only real dream sequence that was even memorable was the first one in the bus . It may be worth a look , but I won't recommend it .
548498	1111192	91778	5.0	The dangers of drinking the worm in tequilla graphically displayed .	This sequel was okay at the theater when I saw it , but it wasn't great . Kind of an average film that adds plot points that really are a bit weak . We find out in this one that it was not necessarily the fact the little community was sitting on an old cemetery that was the problem in the first one , but rather that the house was over some burial ground of a cult . There is also this really old man that is a bit creepy wandering around looking for Carol Anne and the Freeling clan . I just think they wanted to add a more physical enemy , someone you could focus on . The family is now living with grandma , but strange stuff starts happening again . For some reason they want Carol Anne . An Indian guy comes to their aid and gives them advice and there are a series of happenings , but this one just isn't as good as the first one as it is very slow in places . The ending was just plain lame and only makes this one worse than it is . As not good as this is though , the next Poltergeist makes this one look a lot better . Some good scenes here and there , but ultimately this one disappoints . Though there is that memorable scene with the worm .
548475	1111192	932936	5.0	The creed of the assassin must be to do the same thing over and over again .	When I first started playing this game it was rather good . I had heard that a lot of gaming magazines had given this game mediocre reviews and I could not understand why . The game was really fun right there at the beginning and then you had a huge world to ride through and towns to explore . Not to mention the graphics are simply stunning . However , the game play for me got very tiring after awhile . Had I given this game a review on the first two or three hours after I had started playing it I would have give this game a nine or ten , however , after the initial impact of the game and a few of the same missions over and over I just got sick and tired of this game and I was very happy to win this game and be done with it . Yes , this game gets very repetitive , you are in a huge world and the only things you have to do are save citizens , collect flags , and climb towers to complete your maps . Granted you can fight guards too , but this also becomes a very tedious and annoying too . You kill twenty guards sometimes and still other guards want to fight you . I mean after awhile you would think they would retreat . The story is very talky and rather boring , I got tired of hearing the master and student talk to each other . Then you get sent out on missions to kill where stealth just does not play all that important a role as one might think . The controls are also choppy as you can duck into hay to hide from soldiers , but there is a lag that sometimes gets you spotted before you leap into the hay , which is funny as other times when you are simply jumping from here to there your stupid character seems to get sucked into the hay . Fighting is also a bit lacking as all you mainly do is counter attack and quickly dispatch most of the enemies . There are no really big battles till the end and by then you just want the pain to stop as this game actually gave me headaches nearly every time I played it . Especially when I took time to save the annoying citizens who say all of four different things when you rescue them . Then you have your annoying citizens you wish you could kill , but you can not such as the begging women and the crazy people who hit you . Still , the first level which was basically a walk through was fun as it was set in some sort of run down temple underground and your mission to use logs to get rid of some soldiers was fun and made me think this game would be really special , the first assassination was fun too as was visiting my first major city . However , after I got over my initial awe I was underwhelmed by mission variety and ready for the game to end . . . and to top it all off it had a rather bad ending with generic credits and the music was nothing special either .
549086	1111192	64393	5.0	Wow for a bad movie it is sort of good . . . GREEN SLIME ! ! ! !	Yes , what to say about this movie written apparently by Americans , produced and directed by Japanese , and starring American and Italian actors and actresses . You have to say it is a fun movie to watch even though it is rather bad too . It is also rather good as well ! ! ! Yes , this movie is a mixed bag to be sure , but overall it is fun to watch because even the badness of the movie is fun to see . It also has lots of hot gals in it , somewhat brutal kills for a movie of this type , and you get rather strange tentacled beasties that are green , but do not really look all that much like slime . Well they did start off looking more like slime in their more " young " form I guess you would call it . Basically , it is an alien gets on board spaceship and cause havoc movie , and you can not really say this one copied Alien as this came out well before it . The effects are right out of a Godzilla movie , the monsters look like they were scheduled to fight Godzilla in Godzilla vs Hedorah , but got fired for not looking slimy enough and somehow managed to land a gig playing green slime . You get to see a lot of weapons fired at the seemingly impossible to kill slime , which is fine by one scientist who seems to really want to befriend them or something . Then you have a rather cool conclusion and then you have that awesome song at the end . Is this a good movie ? Most certainly not , but it is just hard to bash a movie that has such great campiness and hot gals , and cool cheap effects and a hell of a uplifting song . . . GREEEEEN SLIMMMME ! ! ! !
548384	1111192	51418	5.0	A bit tedious .	This version of the Blob , which is the original , is a bit boring at times . The only saving grace of the film is Steve McQueen in the lead role . He is fun to watch in anything . This movie has a great premise as a meteor lands and out comes a goop that eats and gets bigger with seemingly no other purpose . The problem is that it didn't get much screen time , as there are long stretches of no blob in sight . The highlight of this one is the attack on the movie theater . Other scenes just aren't all that convincing .
548431	1111192	81747	5.0	Oh , that volcano isn't going to erupt .	Yes , this is the typical 70's all-star disaster flick . Though this one was made in 1980 . This one , however , was not a hit . When " The Towering Inferno " was in theaters , it made over 100 million at the box office . When this one was at theaters , it made less than 2 million . Part of the problem is that it doesn't look much like a movie for the theater . In fact , when I first saw it , I thought it was a made for television movie . I think most of the budget in this one went to the stars , and not nearly enough went into special effects . The story in this one is typical of a volcano movie as it has someone trying to warn people that the volcano is going to erupt . Of course no one believes them and then an eruption occurs . We have people getting fried , and a select group trying to head for safety . Along the way they have to cross a bridge , and it turns out there is someone who has a special ability to be put in use here like the character in " The Poseidon Adventure " who was an excellent swimmer . This one has some good qualities though and if you have nothing else to do it may be worth a look-see , but it is definitely nothing special .
548641	1111192	466875	6.0	Kind of a minimal movie , but not bad .	By minimal I mean there aren't all that many characters to get to know , and there also are not all that many sets . . . so basically a horror movie with a very limited potential for kills . Still I thought it was done rather well , could have been better , but then again most horror movies could would have and should have been better . This one has a very pretty girl with a number of tragedies that have marked her life . Her mother died when she was born , her grandfather died the prior year she just wants to have fun on her birthday for once . Well she goes with a friend to a wild frat party , which is mistake number one and her friend hooks her up with an obvious scumbag . Why do gals prefer this scum who would do what he does to a guy like me I will never know , but that is just the facts . This guy precedes to take her to the basement and gets her to tell her sad story and after she passes out from the drug in her drink rapes her . Great guy , eh ? Well the drug in the drink kills the girl and is the movie over . . . no ! It has just begun as the girl must now try to figure out the afterlife as her grandfather is there , but he seemingly wishes to do her harm and also there is her guardian angel who tries to explain things to her , but he also seems kind of menacing as well . There are flashes of others in her life , things looking for her soul and she also has the ability to look back on the life she left behind and see the party still going on . Like I said not bad , just needed more , the girl is really pretty and she does a nice job . I could have used a couple of more venues as I get really tired of the frat house . From the back of the box I was actually expecting more of a darker version of an earlier film I enjoyed " Highway to Hell " , still there are worse ways to spend one's time .
548771	1111192	89927	6.0	This Rocky is a bit much , but still okay .	Yes , this Rocky takes aim at the cold war between the US and Russia or USSR that was taking place during the time of this movie . This one is also more over the top than part three and just not realistic at all . Still , those training sequences in this movie as well as parts of the fight really get one's blood pumping . The movie has a Russian boxer coming to America to take on any challenger bold enough to go head to head with him . For some reason , this infuriates Apollo and he is the one to challenge the Russian . Well the fight occurs and tragedy occurs , to much tragedy we lose one of the most interesting and fun Rocky characters when all he had to to was lose and maybe get partially paralyzed or something . Apollo dying just mirrored Mickey's death in the previous movie to much . Well now Rocky wants revenge and he is going to Russia to fight the monster that killed his friend . Great training scenes occur and Rocky and the monster fight . The fight is a bit much , but still cool . This movie has a fast flow , so despite its flaws it is an okay film .
548243	1111192	90098	6.0	Why the boat race at the end ?	This is a movie about a family that goes on a vacation and rents a beach house . When they first arrive they are at a beautiful house that has its own beach . Unfortunately , it turns out to be the wrong house and the house they do have is not nearly as nice . This one is very good for laughs at the beginning , but it really tails off near the end . It ends up being the old ; let's race boats plot . Why it feels it needs this plot point is beyond me . I enjoyed it , just seeing the family on their trip and all the things that happened to them , but in the end it switches to having to win the race . All in all though it is pretty funny to watch .
548976	1111192	48127	6.0	Somewhat good in places , but does not have the impact of the first movie .	I finally now have seen this the second Godzilla movie made . The first where Godzilla takes on another monster . . . the other monster presented is Anguirus . The story was pretty good for the most part as they make it clear in the Japanese cut anyway , that this is a new Godzilla and not the one destroyed by the oxygen destroyer . Also , this new monster is also discovered . The cities just off the coast are on alert , everything seems to go well until a bunch of prisoners escape and start a large fire ( light apparently attracts Godzilla ) and not only does he come , but so does Anguirus and they battle in the city . After the battle there is time to relax as Godzilla leaves peaceful like enough and the city was evacuated very well this time too . Everything is going well until Godzilla reappears in a more northern town , however at one point he is in the middle of a bunch of snow capped mountains and a plan is hatched to stop Godzilla's onslaught again . This movie could have been better though , there is a lot of filler in this movie , I am thinking they felt they needed more scenes to pad out a rather short running time film . However , with this movie coming out only six months after the original , the extra scenes had to be scenes of people rather than of the monsters . Also , the film goes on a bit to long well after the battle between the two monsters . So much so that the threat of Godzilla seems to even evaporate for a time . I also think the plane scene at the end went on to long as their plan should have to worked after they figured it out rather than going back to base to load up on missiles . However , the fight between the two monsters is rather good , and unlike the professional wrestling like quality of the next movie " Godzilla vs King Kong " in this one the monsters fighting seems to be like that of two actual animals and not men in costumes . I think this one would have been much better though if they did not rush to complete it .
548158	1111192	86014	6.0	Four horror tales to fright and delight you !	Not the best anthology movie made , but it was somewhat good . I liked " Creepshow " and " Cat's Eye " better , but this one is on par with " Twilight Zone : the Movie " . There are other anthology movies that this one is a lot better than . For one it has a good number of stories , though in the end they are a little like episodes of the show " Tales from the Darkside " . The first one is based on an urban myth as a woman goes out for cigarettes on a night some crazed mental patient is on the loose . I can't really say much more or I will end up ruining the ending ( which you will know if you ever heard the myth like I have ) . The next story is the best one in my book , mainly because I play a lot of video games . It features a young Emilo Estevez as this really good game player . He is obsessed with this one game called " The Bishop of Battle " . He wants to get to this level that no one has ever gotten too , and one night he breaks into the arcade and he makes it to the level and let's just say he is in for a surprise at what the mystery level contains . The third story is about a priest who has lost his faith . He is driving in the desert where he is confronted by a mysterious truck with tinted windows . They do a cat and mouse routine through the desert terrain . Finally , we have the story of a couple who have a small rat problem . This anthology movie is not going to blow you away , but the tales are good enough to be rather entertaining .
548391	1111192	109550	6.0	A more dark , dark waters movie .	First , I have to say this is at least a more enjoyable film than the 2005 American " Dark Waters " because at least we have something going on . Still not as good as I was hoping in that the movie was flawed in some places . The picture quality was terrible , I don't know if this was done intentionally to make it look older , or maybe the DVD I bought was just a really bad transfer , but this movie looks like it was released in the 70's or something . I know many older movies that look more recent than this and I am not talking big budget ones either . Just watch Fulci's " The Beyond " and it looks a lot newer . Another problem , the movie is a bit to predictable . Not that this is supposed to be a movie with a shocker ending or something , but they should not telegraph the plot revelations to the point where they reveal nothing . Finally , why was this movie called " Dark Waters " and " Dead Waters " ? All through the movie I was expecting some sort of dark ancient demon arising from the water off the coast of the island they were on , but to no avail . . . this scene just never happens . The only water scene has a priest at the beginning of the movie being killed in the water and this death is never really touched on throughout the rest of the flick . Also , another annoying scene is when the one girl talks to the old blind woman who may or may not be revealing important plot points , but her accent is so thick you can not understand her . Still for the most part it was an okay movie , the music was done rather good and is creepy . The dream sequences are great and there are some good deaths here and there and there is good atmosphere for a horror movie . The plot is also kind of interesting , I just wish for an ending scene with a really evil looking monster coming out of the depths of the sea rather than what we get .
548621	1111192	474791	6.0	Semi good horror movie from Singapore , but nothing most of us haven't seen before .	I liked the premise and from what I read on the box it sounded like it would be interesting , and I love a good ghost story . However , I was a bit disappointed by this movie . Not entirely mind you , it had a rather good cast and there was some good ghost moments . Still it was so thoroughly predictable . . . anyone who has seen say " The Sixth Sense " or " A Tale of Two Sisters " will have no problem with the shocking ending seen here . Other than it might be a bit more graphic than those two movies . The movie of a Phillipine girl who goes to work as a maid for a Singapore couple and starts her job during the time of the year when the locals must observe many customs relating to the dead or experience their wrath . Lots of burning paper and other very nice visuals during this part of the film . The job is quite easy from what I see too as the gal who was hired as a maid only does a little of this and that and when she does try to sweep up she gets in trouble with her employer . At least this gives or gal plenty of time to look after her employer's mildly retarded son and see all sorts of creepy stuff . My favorite was the play where she sat in the front row . So all in all a typical ghost flick with nothing really new to add to the mix except for a mysterious girl who dies by leaping from a food court . Didn't quite understand that one . So if you like this type of movie you may think it is an okay flick if you are looking for something new , this is not it .
549137	1111192	175142	6.0	Somewhat funny spoof .	This movie had its moments , but I found too much of the comedy assumes you have watched all the scream movies and all the other lame teen horror of the 90's . So basically , it isn't a stand-alone spoof like Airplane or Top Secret . I have only seen bits and pieces of the scream series , so a lot of times I had to ask what they were making fun of . And what was with all the penis stuff . . . I don't think you saw one female part , but you saw plenty of the guys . The best part of the movie for me was the front part with Carmen Elecktra in the Drew Barrymore role from the first Scream . Not coincidentally , it is one of those scenes I have seen from the Scream series . The jokes come fast and furious making fun of scenes from this movie and that . Some of the other movies spoofed include " The Sixth Sense " and " The Blair Witch Project " . The Witch one was rather good too , but I had seen that movie . This movie is not the best movie ever made , but it is worth a chuckle or two . How it did as well as it did at the box office though is mind-boggling .
548765	1111192	142688	6.0	Started out interestingly enough , but the ending was just to bizarre .	I saw this movie on television a while back and only watched a bit of it because I had something to do . Suffice to say I found it very interesting as Depp's character was appraising these books and then went on to have an interesting conversation with another character interested in a book known as the " Ninth Gate " . Well I found this movie cheap years later so I bought it and it played out somewhat good , as all the book research was actually pretty interesting . Also , there was possible conspiracy afoot . A few twists and turns here and there as Depp's character does not know who to trust , as he is set on a mission to compare three books with each other , those who own the other books are being snuffed out . Then near the end it just got to weird as Depp's character seemed to do some stuff that did not seem to be his motivation for the majority of the flick . He seemed to develop an interest for what the book did on the spur of the moment and it kind of made the movie crash when there were some strange happenings . Still , it was enjoyable enough for what it was , just needed a better ending possibly more realistic . For the most part though this movie is sort of like the satanic version of Da Vinci Code . . . however , it still has some humorous moments as well and strange bits of music that makes it seem like it is a comedy .
548589	1111192	108517	6.0	A more gruesome movie than the first , but not as good .	Julian Sands returns here , but I don't know if he is supposed to be the same guy are not . The rules are all changed around here and in many ways it is almost an entirely different movie . The Warlock in this movie seems nearly indestructible than in the first , and instead of the puritan types that were the ones to try and stop him in the first one , here he must be stopped by druids . This time the Warlock makes a most memorable first appearance , and then he goes after these magic stones so he can release Satan into the world . This makes the druid angle seem rather dumb as I don't think they believe in such things . However , it still is a rather good movie , just not as good as the first . . . in fact this movie might have seemed better if the first one never happened . The movie though does follow a certain pattern . You see scenes of this kids coming into terms with their special powers to stop the Warlock , then a scene of the Warlock finding one of the stones , finally whoever has the stone is killed in an unusual way , and then repeat . This happens till the end and the big showdown occurs . I do so enjoy the shotgun scene . That is about all there is too it , but then the Warlock does kill people in vastly different and interesting ways . Not a great movie , but it is okay and worth checking out , though it is rather gruesome at times .
548370	1111192	91541	7.0	Most of the movie is a laugh , but some of it is the pits .	This movie follows the misadventures of a couple who is in desperate need of a place to stay and end up getting tricked into buying a house well out of their price range that is in the need of a few repairs . Hanks and Long are pretty good and the jokes are really funny , but it is just one of those comedies that has a few scenes that aren't that funny and drag the movie down a notch . For the most part the ending is not the strong point and most of the better jokes are in the beginning and the middle of this one . The funniest stuff coming as they enter their new home and the stairs seem to creak a bit , the electricity seems a tad off , and there are minor problems with the plumbing as well . Throw in also a road warrior type demolition crew , and a permit guy who is a tad on the insecure side . I didn't care for the whole did she have an affair thing in the plot as it seemed it was added to pad the film , but for the most part this movie had its moments and is worth a viewing .
548327	1111192	85854	7.0	I liked it as much as the first but for different reasons .	The first film in these sex romps was more artistic . Very well done , with a dream like state that enhanced the feel of the movie . Sure it was an adult film , but it was a rather classy and well done one . This one kind of says forget about making the dreamlike scenes at times then seems to add them in the movie in a different , weird kind of way . They also seem rather random . So why is it just as good as the original to me ? Well there are two girls that are very hot and cute and their sex scenes trump anything seen in the first movie . One is a very nice looking red head who has a couple of nice scenes , the other a cute brunette who has a very sweet sex scene while wearing her cute uniform a welcome change from the first one where they wore the cute uniforms , but did not really have sex in them at any time in the movie . However , make no mistake this is more of a porno with very little artistic value , granted it is a lot better than the just sex movies released these days . There is just something erotic to me about watching a conversation or a situation progress into a really good sex scene rather than just starting in the middle of two people having sex and they are already usually naked . Though the plot here is just girls go to camp and the male counselor's and a few other guys find a way to entice the girls to have sex or vice versa .
548536	1111192	87451	7.0	Goofy science fiction movie , but that is what they were trying to make .	This movie clearly has a small budget , looks cheap , and isn't very serious . Fortunately , that is exactly what the film makers were going for . I enjoy this one , though it is apparent by its score that most people don't . I just find it funny and I love the cast which includes Ron Pearlman and even Angelica Houston . Heck , John Carradine even has a small role in it , though his scene is absolutely pointless and adds nothing to the flick . In fact it is a rather serious scene especially considering the rest of the movie . This one doesn't look great , kind of like Space Mutiny , but unlike Space Mutiny this one isn't trying to be serious so the effects can be forgiven . This one has a band of space pirates that go after , you guessed it , ice . They do this at the beginning and get immediately captured and this sets up the rest of the movie . No work of art , but it is entertaining to me .
549157	1111192	241307	7.0	This sequel to me was a tad disappointing .	The sequel to the very enjoyable Chrono Trigger is just not up to par with the original . Sure the graphics are a bit better , but the story and game play are not . It is interesting enough to start as your character Serge does a routine mission collecting something or another , while at a beach he is suddenly sent to another dimension . Once where the main difference is that he died at a very young age . You meet this one girl calling herself Kid and meeting her sets you off on a quest against a villain named Lynx . During your quest you will meet a lot of companions , and I mean a whole lot of them . I think you can get forty-four total and that is almost in Suidoken territory . So many that I really can not get into them all and their stories either . However , you will get to see a rock concert and that is rather interesting . You also have to wonder why the scope of the game is so much smaller than the original Super Nintendo game Chrono Trigger . There you go all over the world and to different times . Here , you just flip to the two different realities and the world itself seems limited to just one section as there is an outer sea you never go beyond . Another fault is in the story itself . At one point your character has an out of body experience lets say and this lasts for too long . You spend way to much time for my tastes as this other character . However , if you can get past this the story picks up and is very interesting as you learn the origin of one of the characters and you get a very good ending with nice music if you can do the one thing during the final boss fight . Speaking of music , one of the games main highlights is a very good soundtrack that really captures the moods very well .
548189	1111192	87175	7.0	Movie about penetrating dreams	The poster for this one made it look like Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom . The only thing those two movies had in common though was Kate Capshaw . Why they did it though was to probably get more people in the theater . Although , I thought this movie was pretty good and didn't need to attach itself to basically an unrelated flick . This one has people at a sleep research facility recruiting Quiad who has psychic powers . They have the ability to connect a person to someone else's dreams and the person who connects can observe and interact in the dream . There is something sinister at hand though as the President of the United States who has been plagued by nightmares comes to the facility for treatment . There is also the other person with the ability to go into dreams who is kind of a mystery . Though the more you find out about him the more you learn the truth . Though the best segments of this movie are the boy's snake dream and the President's dream . Good movie to watch . . . pretty enjoyable .
549068	1111192	366292	7.0	Wow . . . um wtf happened there ?	Yes this movie starts out like Ringu and seems to borrow from that heavily . Instead of the cursed video tape , however , we have the a seemingly evil entity using cell phones to go from victim to victim . As this played out I thought to myself , " not the most original movie ever , but it is interesting enough " . Near the end of this movie things shift a bit and never before has a movie made me say " wtf " at the end as this movie did . I mean I haven't a clue what that ending meant or anything . Actually , it could have ended two or three more times before the actual end as this movie had more apparent endings than the final chapter in the Lord of the Rings trilogy . Granted I figured the slimy hug from the ghost wasn't the end , even I was caught off guard by the actual ending . I thought I figured the end , I didn't it threw one curve after another , and in the end we had an uber confusing ending . Before the ending and through most of the movie it is more like " Ringu " as we have people trying to find out and trying to stop the mysterious killings as the victims are apparently getting calls from themselves just as they die . Some rather good kills in this one and a couple of creepy images , but the ending is just really a bit much , it almost seemed to be a happy ending , but then it sort of did not . Still worth a look see if you like Asian horror movies .
548186	1111192	82924	7.0	This one was Italian ?	This surprises me , cause I don't remember it being dubbed and Ernest Borgnaine was in it . Apparently , though it was . From what I remember it was pretty good too . It revolved around a cop who gains super powers after a nuclear accident . There is one catch though as any time he sees something red he loses his powers . Like I said it was a pretty funny comedy , nothing to great but it is worth a look see .
548530	1111192	255198	7.0	Godzilla vs a giant wasp .	This one is okay , but it could have been better . People say it has better fight scenes than Godzilla 2000 , but I actually liked the fights in that one better . This one doesn't pick up where the last one left off ; instead it once again reinvents Godzilla . Though it is the same cool looking rubber suit they used in 2000 . In the next movie they would once again reinvent Godzilla and the suit looks totally different . I wish they used the formula of the 90's movies and made them be one continuous movie rather than starting a different Godzilla movie every time . It just works better for me . Here the Japanese are once again trying to destroy Godzilla this time by using a machine that creates a type of black hole . They enlist the aid of a man who makes miniature stuff which brings up a scene I found totally funny . He does this trick where he puts these ingredients under a hat , he lifts the hat and it is mixed into a cooked spoonful of food . The kids think it is magic , but then a woman reveals it is just a hat that microwaves and little robots are mixing the food , and the kids go away disappointed . To me those tiny robots were kind of impressive . Well inevitably the black hole machine opens up another dimension or something and that is how the wasp first enters . Okay movie , but nothing quite as good as the 90's movies .
548453	1111192	96446	7.0	Pretty good fantasy flick .	Considering how few really good fantasy movies there are out there , this one has to rate pretty high . It is a rather good movie that is fast paced and fun , but it does contain flaws . The main one is Warwick Davis . In some scenes he is good , but in other scenes his character comes off as a bit too whiny . The story is kind of a take off of The Lord of the Rings books . A man , small in statute , has to keep a baby safe from an evil queen who wants to sacrifice it cause it may grow up to kill her . While protecting the child Willow ( Davis ' character ) runs into a swordsman played by Val Kilmer . He does a great job playing this character and is my favorite character in the movie . Some of the effects are good , and some quite lame ( the two little guys accompanying Willow ) , but considering this was 1987 you can overlook this . The battle scenes are ok ( the one at the abandoned castle is the best ) , but they are just not on the scale of other movies of this type . This movie is worth a look though .
549132	1111192	82000	7.0	From the way it starts it looked like it would be the goriest movie ever .	This movie starts off with a bang . A ship without a crew ends up in New York City . It has these mysterious pulsating eggs aboard . The eggs explode and anything the stuff inside the eggs touches explodes as well . This movie is a take on the movie " Alien " , though this one is set on earth . Like I said this one starts out with numerous deaths , but it tails off in the middle , sort of picks up in the end , but it never matches the gore level it had in the first half hour or so . Ian is good in this one as an ex-astronaut , but the rest of the cast could have been replaced . They needed a better female lead , as the one they had was too old . I listened to an interview with the director of this film and he wanted someone younger , but the producer thought they needed someone older and less attractive . He won and we have lines that were definitely made for a younger woman still left in lines like , " you are one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen " . All in all an enjoyable sci-fi flick , but it could have been a lot better if the energy of the beginning could have been used throughout .
548773	1111192	79817	7.0	And Apollo said he did not want a rematch .	Of course , I find it understandable that he wanted one and he had the quick turn around from the first movie . As soon as that fight was over the media started hounding him and he knew the only way to exorcise the demons as it were was to destroy Rocky in the ring . So basically , we have Rocky getting endorsement deals and some cash from the fight in the last movie not really wanting to fight again as Apollo did a real number on one of his eyes that he is almost blind in it . Unfortunately , Rocky is not to good with commercials and the money starts to run out quickly . Take also into account that Adrien is pregnant , however she is opposed to him getting into the ring as well . Well this and that happens and Rocky agrees to the rematch and Mickey is once again training the Italian Stallion . Mickey also has a strategy , to protect the bad eye from further damage and to throw Apollo off his game he is going to make Rocky fight right handed , then when the timing is right let him revert back to being left handed to really throw Apollo . More stuff happens including the birth of Rocky's son and a close call with Adrien and then the fight is on . The fight is not quite as realistic as the first one as this time Apollo was prepared and he was the heavy weight champion of the world . He really should have leveled Rocky . . . however , that would not have made good cinema and the ending was pretty tense there for a bit .
548979	1111192	446013	7.0	Rather good bloody action , however lots of dead scenes as well .	This movie was pretty good for the most part . Nice visuals and great action here and there . With that came a few pointless scenes ( the strange dream sequences ) and a conclusion that could have used a bit more sword fighting . The story , vikings have come to North America with seemingly no other purpose than to kill . What can stop them ? Well looks like a storm took some out killing everybody on board a viking vessel leaving only a boy alive . He is taken into the care of the Indians . Well guess what ? The vikings return and to their surprise one of the natives can take up a sword and slice and dice them . So what are you in store for , lots of head chopping and blood spurting . Unfortunately , at a certain point in the movie it gets a bit tiresome as the hero leads said vikings here and there trying to take out their numbers using nature . Not that it is all bad , but these scenes are a bit overlong and protracted . I preferred him hacking away with his sword . Still , it passed the time nicely and there were some great scenery shots too . The mountain looks particularly good . It probably helped that I watched this movie on blu-ray too , as this made the scenery shots really stand out . So despite its flaws and lack of any stars , for the most part this movie was entertaining and passed the time rather nicely .
548518	1111192	296572	7.0	Not a great movie , but still a somewhat good sci-fi flick .	Here , as in the case with another 2004 release " Van Helsing " , we have a movie that has good action , but kind of a jumbled plot . In fact , this one makes " Van Helsing's " plot seem a bit better . Still though it was worth it to see a science fiction action movie that does not have Star Wars in the title . Without Vin Diesel though this one would have been even weaker . Another movie where it is turn off your brain and enjoy the special effects and the action . One of my problems is the villains in this one . They really should have gotten somebody famous to play the lead villain . Instead , they waste money getting Dame Judi Dench to play a rather pointless character . They also do not spend enough time developing the main villain , instead choosing to waste time on these other two characters plotting against the main villain . Then there is the character that comes out of nowhere with shocking news . Still though it was enjoyable enough and it was in fact a sequel to " Pitch Black " not a prequel . If you like seeing some good fights and stuff blowing up then this is a good flick . If you are expecting some great story then I would suggest you watch something else .
548852	1111192	82186	7.0	Loved this one when I was a kid .	As a kid I saw this one at the theater and I loved it . Not as good now , but it still holds up ok . This movie has a bunch of Greek mythology and a lot of stop motion animation . I am not the biggest fan of this technique , but when Ray Harryhausen is involved it is usually rather good . . . he is the best . This movie has it all swordfights , monsters , and mechanical owls . The story follows our hero as he tries to save the princess from first this monster guy , then the deadly Kraken a giant beast . Medusa , Cerberus , and the three blind witches are in this one too . This one is a really good movie to show your kids that is enjoyable to adults as well .
548969	1111192	367882	7.0	A rather good action adventure , but it just does not have the feel of previous Indiana movies .	Let me just start by saying , I liked this one a tad more than Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom . However , both Last Crusade and Raiders were better films than this one . Indiana is back and while looking a bit old , Harrison Ford is still able to bring the character to life . Shia is good as is most of the cast . The story has the Russians going after artifacts they believe will help their military . Let's just say mind control type stuff is what they are going for . Well they enlist an unwilling Indy to try and find something in a warehouse and after a rather good action scene Indy is back at college where he is promptly let go on leave because of the communist scare at the time . More action ensues as Indy meets a guy named Mutt who need's Indy's help to help his mom and a common professor they both know . More traveling ensues and a bit more action at a strange church or graveyard , then Indy and Mutt are reunited with his mom who turns out to be an old friend of Indy . So more action as there are chases galore and some really big ants , a couple of drops , and the climax in the kingdom of the crystal skull . So it is a fast paced movie which is good , but it just does not feel quite right . This feels like a movie that Indiana Jones just happens to be in rather than it being an Indiana Jones movie . Some of the action was a bit over the top , as anyone who watches a nature documentary knows ants don't go after people like that . It does have more of a 50's feel as they have the communist scare stuff going on , and this one pays a bit of homage to the science fiction films too , and those parts of the movie made it a bit more generic than an Indy movie should be as well . So the final verdict , it was not great , but it was a nice way to spend two hours time . Just do not go in expected to be blown away .
548777	1111192	89880	8.0	Kind of the start of the wave of over the top violent action 80's movies !	Yes , this movie was the start up for mainstream , violent , bloody action movies of the 80's . Movies like Robocop , Die Hard , and a host of others . This one though was the most successful at the box office with a whopping 150 million back in 1985 . Which makes the low score here a bit surprising . Granted I can see why it would not score as well as the first movie in this series as First Blood is the more realistic of this set of movies . I liked this one more because of the over the top way it was presented , but it seems a lot of people must rate this movie as quite bad for it to be rated in the five's . Oh well , to each his own . This movie has Col . Trautman going to a prison where Rambo is doing hard time , the Col . has a proposal for Rambo . If he agrees to do a certain mission in Vietnam he will be pardoned . Well I think Rambo agrees to it less for the pardon , but more for the opportunity to do the mission which is find intelligence that shows the Vietnamese still are harboring prisoners of war . He goes in and there is a bit of action here and there and then Rambo gets caught , then escapes and goes on a bloody rampage . Granted it is a bit much , I still found this movie very fun and entertaining . Lots of bullets are expended , arrows shot , and missiles too ! You know the one guy working in Vietnam is a bit of a butt , so that makes the ending a bit satisfying . So if you are watching this one , do not try to compare it to the first one . . . it was trying to be a bit realistic , while this one sort of says to the heck with that .
548314	1111192	823463	8.0	A duck and cover shooting military game .	I do not usually care for this type of game unless there is something interesting going on . In the case of this game it is the fact you are going against an army of monsters that are coming from within the earth . So that right there means it will not be the typical shooter or bland army game . So you have your super tough soldier you control , released from a prison because at this stage in the conflict the military needs all the help they can get . So you now must battle your way through the locust horde to reach various mission objectives all with the sole purpose of destroying the opposition . Fear not , though as you have other soldiers on your side , helping you with their firepower as well . You also get a vehicle to drive and plenty of weapons , though I really loved the default weapon best . A machine gun with a chainsaw bayonet . The sniper rifle was also cool . Plenty of monsters to shoot too , as you have your basic foot soldiers , your giant nearly indestructible monsters , bat type creatures that avoid light and others . So even though usually this type of game is not for me , this one was rather fun and exciting .
549023	1111192	470125	8.0	I thought at first it would be the best Grandia yet , but it suffers a bit after the halfway point on .	This Grandia started off with a bang , great introduction , the graphics completely ramped up and the fighting engine from previous Grandia's was intact . The story was also great as our wannabe pilot finds himself in the middle of a pursuit for a mysterious girl . Add to that lots of humor , a wise cracking ship captain , a fixed game of dice and this game was going great . It continues to do so as our hero meets his hero and flies the heroine into a holy city to perform a ritual to speak with a god . Somewhere though the game just loses some luster as unlike previous Grandia games , you don't get to have all that many playable characters coming in and out of your party . The villains , aside from one of them , are for the most part largely unexplored . . . I mean you will not know their motivations at all . Then there is a point where you just keep hitting dungeon after dungeon with no real opportunity to explore any new cities or such . Then there is the combat difficulty . In previous Grandia's , you never had to build your level . . . by that I mean spend an hour or two just fighting monsters to level up . You simply had to fight everything in your path and by the end you had no troubles . Here the monsters got incredibly hard , not only did I have to level up , I had to run from monsters . Especially in the last level , I had a harder time with the regular monsters than I did with the final boss . Still , it was a pretty good game with the best ending of any in the Grandia series .
549084	1111192	409459	8.0	Good movie , but certain parts of the film seemed to keep me in the dark .	This movie was really quite enjoyable . . . its long runtime was a no issue for me . The main problem I had with this film is that I have never read the graphic novel that it is based on and certain parts of the film had me going " huh , what , who ? " . Do not get me wrong though , still a good movie and I got it enough that I was not totally lost or anything . The movie starts with a bang with the murder of a former superhero known as the Comedian . Well not to super as you will see through flashbacks this guy was a bit brutal , yet he also seemed to get it in ways most do not . He was the Comedian , a punchline of the American people almost a caricature of its worst . Through the story you meet others from the days of superheros as for some reason they are outlawed during the time of this world a strange 1985 parallel world where Nixon is the president still and the world is on the brink of a global nuclear war that would seemingly end most life . The only thing that seems to prevent this is one of America's strongest superheros a person who is seemingly close to being a god , Dr . Manhattan . Well he and another former superhero , Ozymandias is trying to create a limitless amount of fuel that would help rid the need for war . Well the death of the Comedian does not sit well with another superhero known as Rorschach who is a rather brutal hero in the same mold as the Punisher . He warns Nightowl , and Dr . Manhattan and his girl the Silk Specter . Through all this you know all is not as it seems and you are heading to some strange revelations at the end . Good action scenes as I loved watching the opening battle and the Rorschach prison escape . . . actually I loved everything about him being in prison as he was by far my favorite character cause even though he seemed the weakest of the bunch he still persevered and even though he seemed a tad off he still kept to his principles . Suffice to say I did not care for the ending to much . However , this was a very fun ride and my main complaints come from the fact this movie could have actually used a longer runtime . There was this cat that was with Ozymandias that came out of nowhere and talking to some who have read the novel was actually a lot more developed . I wanted to know why superhero vigilantes were banned as well . I have so many other stuff I wish they had developed as Ozymandias is almost a no show in the movie especially in the flashback scenes , I would have liked to see him in action as a superhero . So I liked it for the most part , I do want to read the graphic novel that I am told is a lot better than the movie .
548928	1111192	70634	8.0	The main title here is better than the one I bought it as .	I got this movie as " Count Dracula and His Vampire Brides " . This title is not very good as his brides are not really all that important to the plot . The main one here though fits it well . This is my first Hammer Dracula movie and despite its low score here I really enjoyed it myself , but then I am a big fan of Cushing and Lee . I do agree with the one reviewer though who said the one scene featuring Count Dracula coming in on the one girl should have been removed as it would have made Van Helsing's and Dracula's first meeting more effective . I also would have added ten to twenty more minutes as this one has a plot that needed more exploring . I also think this was the last of the Dracula films for Lee and Cushing and they should have gone out with a bigger bang . Still I really liked this one ; Lee is a great Count Dracula his size really makes him stand out . Peter Cushing is equally as good as Dr . Van Helsing , but that is no surprise . . . seeing him in other roles you can tell he would make a good Helsing . Lots of bizarre stuff in this one and Lee is not in it all that much , but not to worry Cushing is in it quite a bit . As long as one of them are seen a lot I will not complain . There is nudity too so all in all this one is really cool . Now though I really want to get all of the Hammer Dracula movies .
548418	1111192	441877	8.0	Good game , but man your arm tires playing it on the wii .	I enjoyed this Legend of Zelda game a good bit . It is actually the first one I have played and won since the one for the super Nintendo . The graphics are rather good and the story is a bit good too . There is just so much to do that at times you can get frustrated and using the wii remote can also prove to be a headache . The fighting consists of swinging the remote here and there , only to have enemies reappear moments later or even if you leave a room and return . I wish they would stay dead a bit longer . Also , there are moves that are made harder by the wii controller as well . Still , a rather engaging storyline propels this one and makes you want to finish the game . That and the fact I had the strategy guide to help me . Lots of locales await you too , the desert , an icy field , and even a submerged temple . You must gather your equipment as in every Zelda game to proceed . And speaking of Zelda , let's just say the game really should not be named after someone whose role in the game is minimal at best . You have your mini boss fights and your big boss fights , I usually had more trouble with the mini ones because all the big ones have tricks that the book tells you how to solve . I also enjoyed Link's little helper in this one as a strange shadow creature named Midna . The ending was a bit sad , however all in all a good game for the wii .
548828	1111192	87800	8.0	The best of the series , period !	In fact it isn't even close . This is about the only Nightmare I fully enjoy . It is a creepy , highly atmospheric horror that delivers . It centers on these teenagers that seem to be having the same dreams of this strange man . This man in their dream menaces them and terrorizes them . In fact , if he injures you in the dream you will have the injury when you awaken . This movie had a very good story and a great killer in Freddy . Unfortunately , in later episodes Freddy became a comedian and his overall creepiness disappeared . This one , however , is great as there are some very memorable death scenes .
548982	1111192	409904	8.0	Good sequel to Night Watch . . . though it is somewhat hard to follow .	This movie is of course a sequel , and like no other sequel before I say it is very important to watch the first one or you will be lost . I watched the first one and I was confused here and there by this movie . So what do we have for a plot . It takes up a bit after the first one , as the dad whose son turned towards the dark ones at the end of the last movie is training a new recruit who he is a bit sweet on . It took me a bit to figure out who she was , but I think she was the one from the last movie that was going to cause some destruction by cursing herself . Well , there are deaths that occur and people are framed . The whole movie is basically a plot to get a war going again between the forces of dark and light . The son did not play as big a role in this as I thought as the movie was more about getting this chalk known as the chalk of destiny that can redo ones destiny . Some good action and some funny scenes as well , though there is also a most bizarre scene with the hero and his girlfriend in the shower . Doesn't sound strange , but when you see it you will understand . The movie is not without flaws though as the running time is a bit long . I can easily see a couple of cuts that could have been made to shorten the length a bit . There is some gore , but nothing like one would find in a more horror oriented movie , this one is more action than horror , even more drama than horror . The conclusion was okay , could have used a bit more here and there . . . though there was a good scene involving all this balls going through Moscow and tearing it up . The special effects are rather good as well . So in the end , a bit better than the first movie , however , it still could have used some work .
548298	1111192	93773	8.0	One of Arnold's best .	This one has soldiers attacking a base of rebels or terrorist or something . After they hit the base though the fun begins as this creature from outer space is tracking them through the thick jungles . It kills them one by one , hunting them . The army men led by Arnold try to set traps for the creature , but no matter what they do the creature always is one step ahead and one tough critter . The fact that this movie was such a hit is a bit of a surprise . . . in fact how good it was is a surprise too . They had so much trouble shooting this one , almost all the predator shots had to be done again as the original Predator looked really bad . . . it was played by Jean Claude Van Dame . They got a really tall actor to take his place and it worked a lot more as this one towers over Arnold and made the final fight great . The design of the monster's face changed a lot too , as the original looked really stupid , more like a mosquito or something from a bad science fiction movie of the 50's . In the end though this one turned out great and the finale is one of the best . Arnold facing off against a giant , ugly , super space alien hunter .
548424	1111192	397040	8.0	Not beyond good , but good nonetheless .	The critics loved this game and so I thought I would buy it . In the end it was a rather good and original game . The only two problems I have with it is the fact it is too short and the ending is a bit lacking . The rest of the game is rather fun though and rather easy to pick up and varies as well . You control Jade , a gal who watches over these orphans at a lighthouse . Why are they orphans , well an alien race has come to this particular planet full of all sorts of weird aliens and is causing havoc by abducting its citizens and such . A military group is on the planet to protect it , but they seem to have issues as well . Well you must guide Jade through this planet searching for the truth and you even become a sort of photographer for a group committed to exposing the truth . So this for me was the best portion of the game as you must sneak in these facilities and take pictures . You are also awarded for taking pictures of the various alien life forms on the planet . You do some fighting , and it is rather easy to perform , but stealth also plays a key role in the game . You will also use a hovercraft to reach areas and win races and a spaceship late in the game . So there a various things to do . Still though it wraps up way to soon , and the ending doesn't really overwhelm . Still though , it is different from all the sequels and such that come massive waves .
548514	1111192	435653	8.0	The lesson here , don't read mysterious cards in the graveyard then dance .	A rather good offering of horror and the supernatural to behold . Think a better version of the remake of " The Haunting " with a bit of " The Entity " thrown in as well . The movie revolves around a group of three friends who are in mourning for the recent loss of a friend . One of the group wants to go to the cemetery at night to mourn the friend by drinking and talking with his other two college buds . Of course , you know in a movie of this type that is a mistake and is going to lead to the cause of the problem . Well not entirely , the one friend finds a type of card on their friend's grave , with a bit of a poem celebrating life on it , one of course does this by dancing on graves and yes this is the start of the spooky stuff as the title does imply . So what we have is our three friends seemingly being haunted , minimally at first and it progresses worse and worse as the movie goes on . Paranormal investigators are brought in to try and help and one of them is really helpful , the other not so much . I won't tell you which one is which , but I will tell the female one is really cute . I love a girl with black hair and kind of a bookish look to her . You will have to wait a bit for some kills , but that is okay as the movie has a good enough story to overcome this . It isn't all perfect as there is a bit of confusion as to why the letter is set on the grave in the first place though I do suppose it adds a hint of mystery to the flick . Just like the poor unfortunate girl who is shown at the beginning . Some of the effects at the end were a bit cheesy as well , however , this can be forgiven too because I doubt this movie had a very big budget . I can say though that the spooks looked rather good .
548343	1111192	435625	8.0	Prepare to descend into the very depths of fear .	I enjoyed this movie about six gals mainly from England going caving . The movie was fast paced once they got to the caves and did not let up until the finish . The story has a woman who the previous year lost both a husband and daughter to a very gruesome car accident . She was apparently an extreme sports junkie , but for the past year has been in mourning for the loss of her loved ones . Now , however , she reunites with some old friends and they are going caving , girls only . They are supposed to go to a rather simple cave to explore with no real danger or thrills , however one of the members of the group has decided instead to take them to a cave she discovered . . . and what the girls discover there is sheer terror . This movie was very effective , even before there are any kind of creatures introduced the movie was tense . There is a great scene involving being stuck in a tight place , a really dangers climbing the wall scene and a scene involving a broken leg . I mean the poor girls have virtually no shot at survival at this point then if all this is not bad enough there is something lurking in the caves and it likes to feast on flesh . So there ya go , finally a horror movie that does seemingly indeed put our cast in a virtually inescapable situation with no apparent way out . It is not all good though , I did not care for some of the character's behavior towards the end as I would hope one would rather lean on someone for support . Instead there is a rather shocking scene that to me seems petty . Wait and try to get out then settle differences . Still this horror movie was really good and tense .
548739	1111192	808465	8.0	Not as good as the previous two Shadow Heart games , but good game nonetheless .	This is by far the lightest of the three Shadow Heart games being that it contains a lot of humor . Nearly all of the dark edge and Gothic look from the previous installments is gone replaced by Amazon ninjas and giant cats . The judgment ring is back and as good as ever . However , this time there are add ons to the battles I did not care for called double attacks . The problem with these is that the enemy is more efficient at using them than you are and this just makes the game a bit harder than I like my role playing games to be . It also makes the enemy turns longer too , which I always hate the enemy turn to take forever . Still , it did not detract from the game all that much . The story is okay too , just not as good as the other two . Johnny Garland is a boy detective living with somebody you will recognize from the previous game . He is waiting for a big case and gets it from a creepy man named Gilbert and boy does it turn out to be a big case as he must team up with a wild assortment of characters to track down a mysterious person only called lady and her accomplice Killer . During the way you will also meet an old friend and visit many locales . However , later in the game to many of these locales end up being old temples so you just don't have all the cool locations of the first two games . Yuri is also gone and is no where to be seen and that is a shame , I kept hoping for some type of appearance . So all in all a good entry , it is just after the spectacle that was part two , this one just is not very spectacular .
548778	1111192	98412	8.0	Rather good vampire flick .	It has its bad points , but for the most part I liked this title , which is more of a comedy than a horror . Bruce Campbell as Van Helsing is pretty funny to watch in this one and the rest of the cast does a good job as well . The tale is about an all vampire town that is tired of killing so they actually have been able to create a synthetic blood with the help of this one guy who doesn't know they are vampires . Something goes wrong with the machine so the guy who made it comes to town to fix it . . . unfortunately the town has malcontents who want to go back to the day of drinking real blood rather than the fact stuff . Van Helsing also arrives in town looking for Count Dracula who doesn't apparently live in the town . Like I said more comedy and action than horror . There are some flaws in the movie , but most of them have to do with the plot . Like why would these two teenagers join the vampires when one killed their friend ? There are a couple of other points like this , but it is best to just sit back and enjoy the show .
548789	1111192	107144	8.0	I thought it was funnier than one , but then I have seen the Rambo movies .	Yes , I thought this one was funnier mainly because I have seen more of the movies this one has spoofed . I loved that Richard Crenna was in this one and I loved the fight scene spoofing the one seen in Rambo III . Charlie Sheen is back and still super funny , as is Lloyd Bridges who always makes a good choice for a spoof movie . The movie of choice here is the Rambo saga , mainly part two and three . You have a plot of a missing group of soldiers and they keep sending more in to seemingly get captured . Finally , Topper Harley is on the case going in with his own platoon to free the numerous hostages . So we get our various scenes making fun of the Rambo movies as these are the best . The ones before he sets off on his quest are not quite as good . I liked his first encounter with an old friend , the boat scene , and numerous others . The best for me was the scene when the kill counter was up and it became the bloodiest movie of all time ! ! ! It also has a great scene between Lloyd's character and a Sadaam look a like . So in the end if you have not seen the Rambo movies and a few other movies it will not be quite as funny as it was for me who had seen the majority of movies this one spoofs .
548729	1111192	88794	8.0	At times it seems like the typical teen comedy . . . then it takes bizarre twists .	Yes , this movie follows the typical teen romantic comedy type formula , but it adds a lot of weird stuff in it to make it more original and a bit demented . Kind of like the mother added this and that to the one meal she cooked , granted the one ingredient she mentioned was normal enough . . . raisins . The story , guy who seems likable enough has just been dumped by his girlfriend . Sounds normal enough , till you realize the girlfriend seems to date just about anyone and everyone . Well guy wants to win her back so he is going to try to ski this deadly run that the one guy his ex seems to be dating a bit more than others is an expert at . There you go , sounds simple . . . throw in a cute foreign exchange student and you have your typical teen romantic comedy . Though it is not as cut and dry as that as our hero must overcome an obsessed paper delivery boy , a strange introverted guy and his loud mouth mother , a fairly normal dad but odd mother , a brother who gets the ladies and builds super science fiction stuff , a friend who snorts everything but drugs because their town apparently does not sell them , a part time job at a burger joint , a drawing that takes a life of its own , and many other strange happenings . Add to that the fact from time to time our hero tries unsuccessfully to commit suicide and you have your very strange , but funny teen romantic comedy .
548410	1111192	1073668	8.0	Nice to know even in the future the shotgun still does some damage .	This game was not quite what I was expecting and was for the most part a lot of fun . It is a role playing game through parts of it and a Gears of War shooter as well . The story has you as Shepard , who has a default look to him or you can make him or her to your tastes . He is trying to become the first human Spetre in a strange and vast intergalactic government system . However , you must go through a lot of trials as aliens called Geth are on the attack and another Spectre agent named Saren has gone rogue . The graphics are great , the story interesting , the fighting so so . It is like Gears of War , just not quite as tight . I also did not care for the driving around on planets much at all . However , I loved the role playing elements which sort of were like Knights of the Old Republic only a bit better . You can talk to various people at times and pick up missions that can be simple get an item missions or be more complicated to the point of going to multiple planets and eliminating an enemy threat . The main story has great points , I especially like the part where Shepard and the true enemy have their first meeting . So for a cool science fiction role playing action game I can not recommend anything better than this .
548426	1111192	419020	8.0	Kind of a role playing game lite , but fun nonetheless .	Considering these days of the 50 plus hour role playing game , it was a nice change of pace to play this quirky game . Granted it wasn't exactly short topping 30 hours , but that is still a far cry from the games out today that take over 50 without doing all the side quests . However , it being a Mario game it is going to be more kid friendly and funny rather than dramatic and epic . The fighting is turned based , however you get to push buttons to strengthen your attacks . You have two people in your party , one always being Mario and the other one of the many funny characters Mario meets during his journey through a place called Rougeport . Princess Peach sent Mario a map said to have the location of a hidden treasure on it and she wants him to meet her in Rougeport . Well Mario can't refuse , but by the time he arrives , gasp , the princess has been kidnapped . Well this time Bowser is not responsible , though he does make many humorous appearances in the game . . . no this time it is a mysterious group called the X-nauts . So Mario must join forces with many in the town of Rougeport and surrounding lands to obtain the crystal stars . You have your basic levels and your not so basic as you have train mystery's to solve and you must fight your way to the top in an arena type setting . So the game gives you differing things to do so all in all it is rather fun .
549165	1111192	356910	8.0	A bit of comedy , action , and romance all in one movie .	This movie stars Brad Pitt and Anjelina Jolie . It also has Vince Vaughn in it . Other than them , you won't really remember to many other people in this flick , but that is okay . It works and makes for a fun experience at the theater . The movie is about two contract killers who are married and neither knows what the other does for a living . The spark is gone out of their married lives , but once they find out what they do and end up targeting each other it adds a little spice to their lives . The comedy is funny , the action is great ( particularly the car chase scene ) and there is a dash of romance added as well . The three actors listed above all do a great job . Pitt is the more funny one , but Jolie plays her role as the slightly more professional hit-man great too . And of course Vaughn is funny in his role as well . The movie is not perfect however , as I found it sort of ran a little to long in the end and also the ending leaves one wondering just how they escaped their little predicament . Other than that , however , it was an enjoyable and funny movie .
548533	1111192	103064	9.0	The sweeping epic of the series .	This terminator movie is the big one of the three ; by big I mean the longest one , the one that was the epic blockbuster . I like all three the same though . This one is the biggest of the bunch and has many great special effects ; this one also though has a couple of boring spots in it . The other two have better flow while this one stops here and there . Still though there are great action scenes , though nothing as good as the chase in part three . It also has a cool villain in the T-1000 , a terminator that was very tough to kill . I say it was a lot more durable than the T-X in part three even if it couldn't do some of the stuff it could . Arnold is of course great in the one role that is perfect for him and Linda Hamilton is good as well . Furlong is okay , but he can get on your nerves so I am glad he didn't come back for part three . This one has it all and is the grandest of the bunch as far as scope , Cameron was trying for a big budget , and big event movie and he succeeded .
548912	1111192	68371	9.0	Godzilla in a tag team match against his old foe and a new one .	I like this Godzilla movie now that I have seen it again on DVD . In fact it has become one of my favorites of the original Godzilla movies . What I like most is the characters in it and the investigative scenes where they try to figure out just what is going on . Of course there is also the cool monster fighting , but I just did not find the monster fighting to be the highlight of this one . This one has a guy hired on to draw monsters for a new kind of theme park that has kind of a monster theme , but is also aimed to open a door to to some sort of absolute peace . There does seem , however , to be something deeply suspicious about the people who work at this place . There is also a mysterious tape reel stolen by a girl that may add some light to the mystery . The guy hired to draw teams up with this girl and a guy to figure out what is behind the disappearance of her brother . We soon learn the identity of the men and the reason behind their theme park , but by that time it is to late as the monsters Gidorah and Gigan are unleashed upon Japan . Fortunately , Godzilla and Anguriahs come to the rescue . The fighting here is okay , but part of the fighting between Godzilla and Gidorah looks suspiciously like it came from another of their movies as all the fighting here takes place at the theme park and some scenes look nothing like the area . This is also the first Godzilla movie to feature Godzilla bleeding , I love the scenes where Gigan cuts Godzilla's shoulder , so did the makers of this film because they used it in Godzilla vs Megalon as well . In fact there are quite a few scenes from this movie in that one . That one also features kind of a tag match up however I didn't like it nearly as much as I didn't care for the characters in that one .
548706	1111192	57076	9.0	Simple plot , but great movie .	This is a very good Bond movie that is easy to follow . The mission get a decoding machine from the Russian's . Sounds simple , but SPECTRE is trying to play the British into getting the machine for them . This is the Bond movie that relies less on in your face action and more on spy stuff . Bond has to use his wits if he wishes to escape Turkey the decoding device alive . He gets help from Kerim Bey , a wealthy man who does spy stuff for kicks . He also must get the help from Tatiana who thinks she is working for Russia , but is actually working for SPECTRE . Great villians abound in this flick too , as there is Rosa Kleb ( who is the inspiration for the female villian in Austin Powers ) and Robert Shaw who I never recognized but then reliazed it was him as a SPECTRE super soldier . The scenes on the train are great and unlike Dr . No this one has a really good finale .
549133	1111192	280609	9.0	One cool werewolf movie .	This movie has a lot of other movies it shares things in common with . It has a little of " Predator " in it . It also has a little " Dead Alive " and " Night of the Living Dead " in it as well . It has other movies too , but this one is a very good werewolf movie . This one revolves around a troop sent into the woods for training exercises . They uncover another team that appears to have been ripped to shreds . The good news is that these people who were killed left behind lots of weapons , and seeing how the other troop only had guns that fire blanks it is a good thing . The bad news is that all these weapons are fully loaded ; whatever killed these guys did so , so quickly that the soldiers never even had a chance to return fire . There is one survivor who has a giant claw mark in his chest . The soldiers eventually find out that there are werewolves out in the woods and they find a girl who drives them to a farmhouse where the army men must hold out till dawn when hopefully the werewolves will return to normal . Great flick , people always told me this one was worth checking out and they were right . The only problem I had was understanding the actors at times as they really had some heavy accents . . . don't know if they were British or Scottish . You can understand them for the most part though ; it is just at times they say something that you don't hear right and at others they will say a " saying " and you won't be sure what they are meaning . Other than that though this one was really cool .
548458	1111192	317648	9.0	A good action western .	I usually do not go for westerns , but this one looked rather good on the trailers so I gave it a try . It exceeded expectations and was a good movie to me . I thought it could have cut a few scenes here and there , but all in all it was very entertaining . Though I highly doubt all the things that happened in the movie happened in real life as claimed by the makers of the film , I think the guy this movie is based on was probably a good story teller . This one has a cowboy whose specialty is long distance races going to the Middle East to race there because they do not like the claim that he is the best long distance racer there is . Which is fair enough considering it does not look like there is all that much desert terrain in the United States . This race is very dangerous and it makes you thirsty just to watch it . Of course there are many trials and obstacles along the way including his fellow racers who hate the idea of a Mustang horse competing in the race . Though you know a Mustang has to be a rather fast and strong horse because they named a rather good car after it . All in all a very good action movie that the entire family can enjoy .
548288	1111192	416779	9.0	A very good action game with a very cool character . . . Kratos .	Yes , this game was very fun and well worth the 14 . 99 I paid for it on sale . The story has Kratos as a man hell bent on revenge . The target for his revenge , Ares the god of war . Ares has his own plans as he is trying to take down Aphrodite , she is using Kratos though to take him down . So you have your double crosses and such . Why is Kratos wanting revenge , well Ares tricked Kratos into killing his own family so there ya go . The combat in this game is very fun , simple to do yet it looks very cool . You do cool combos and nifty looking finisher type moves on various mythical creatures . You span a few levels as you start with a cool ship scene and also an attack on a city , you also have to go through this strange fortress on top of a giants back . My favorite level though is the hades level as it looks really awesome . Speaking of awesome , the graphics here are just that . From the giant Minotaur's , to the super scenery , and to the falling people in the hades level everything here looks exceptional . My only complaint is the rather short play time and the shortage of boss fights which is a shame , because the ones they do have are very fun . So for a fun game that offers a challenge , but does not make you rip your hair out give this game a try . Add to that you even get to see some boobies ! ! !
549002	1111192	142236	9.0	Lots of action and comedy in this DBZ movie .	This one features more fighting and comedy than most of the movies to this point . This one features a mistake that leads to the birth of a creature named Janemba . It promptly takes over otherworld and the dead come back to life on earth . Gohan , Videl , Trunks , and Goten go to stop the more rowdy ones while Goku and this green guy named Pikan try and solve the problem from their side . The fighting is top notch as you see Goku turn SSJ 3 for the first time in a movie . . . at first Janemba seems rather playful and harmless ( kind of like Buu ) , but after he is seemingly beaten he turns into a very destructive creature . Vegeta comes to help and they must perform fusion to beat this new threat . Meanwhile , Trunks and Goten battle Hitler and his army ( don't ask ) . My main complaint is the battle between the fused Vegeta and Goku and the villain does not last very long at all . Otherwise though this one is very entertaining and it has a very funny scene where the fusion does not work very well .
548459	1111192	335438	9.0	A rare comedy for me . . . I actually thought it was funny all the way through .	Usually , when I go to the theater to see a comedy I end up finding it rather disappointing . It either has periods where there is nothing funny going on , or all the best stuff was shown on the trailers so you really see nothing new . This one broke that trend for me and I just thought it was one of the funniest comedies I have seen at the theater . " Pirates of the Caribbean " is another rare comedy that I enjoyed at the theater . What made this one were Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson . They are really funny together and there is chemistry there . After watching this one I think I want to try and find " Zoolander " and see if it is any good . This movie has the two as the cops from the old television show of the same name . I never saw much of the show , but you don't really need too as I thought most of the jokes were not really dependent on seeing the show . And this one works better than most of the television shows turned movies for me because this one actually set the movie in the time when the show ran . They usually put the show in the here and now , but not in this case . There are also plenty of ladies in bikinis to look at as well . There are very funny scenes all through the movie my favorites were the ones involving the interrogation , the one with Will Ferrell , and the one involving the kid throwing the knives . The other cast members were good as well and surprisingly Snoop Dog was very good as Huggy Bear . Vince Vaughn was also rather good as the villain . All in all a funny comedy that entertains throughout .
548474	1111192	1288501	9.0	Very good and epic military video game .	Yes , this sequel to the 2006 game is explosive and very good , a bit better than the original game . The characters are back and just as wise cracking as ever and the story that unfolds is better than that of a lot of movies . The game play for the most part remains the same . You engage in a lot of fire fights where you duck and cover and shoot from the cover . A few differences in this one is that the chainsaw bayonet from the first game is used more here as I carved up a lot more enemies with it this time around . Another difference is the ability to use your downed enemies as shields . There are also more vehicles to use as you have your standard tank like vehicle and a couple of more unique ones . This game features a rather climatic ending too as well as a hint of a sequel in the future . The story has Marcus and Dom joined by some new characters and returning ones fighting the locust horde from beneath the earth once again . They have a plan to attack the locust and try to end the war with them once and for all . Along the way you have some humor as Carmine a new recruit to the Gears has some problems at first and one scene with the gang in the dark after a vehicle jump . At first I thought I did something wrong , but hearing them chat in the dark was rather funny . You also have a sad scene or two as well . So for one hell of an explosive game that is fun to play give Gears of War 2 a try . Though you really should play the first one so you know the whole story .
548975	1111192	371746	9.0	Iron Man propels himself to the big screen .	Not the biggest Iron Man fan of the comics , however , I usually only see comic book movies these days so I of course had to see this one . In the end I was happy with the result . The story , is the origins of Iron Man so you basically get to witness the events that made Tony Stark the leader of his own company who is a bit fly by night kind of guy is also quite immature into someone willing to risk his life to save people across the world as Iron Man . You get to see the suite take life and all that good stuff . As usual with Marvel adaptations you get some good humor as well as I really enjoyed the scenes of him testing out his suit and trying to perfect flight . Robert Downey Jr . is quite frankly very good here . He portrays someone that is good at just building devices seemingly at will very good as I would expect someone like that to be kind of high energy . You also get to see in this movie a rather good fight at the end too . However , I do have a complaint . . . and although it did not make me hate the movie or anything it did make me not give this movie a ten . I would have liked to have seen a bit more Iron Man functioning at 100 % a bit more . I just rather him be at full force in that last battle as he seemed like he would be the underdog even if he was fully charged . A minor complaint to say the least , but I just thought I would bring it up . However , the ending was rather good and different , nice to see a super hero movie not end with the hero flying off or sitting on a rooftop for a change .
549083	1111192	1073664	9.0	Fallout 3 a test of survival in the capital wasteland .	This type of role playing game is usually not my thing . I prefer the Final Fantasy type role playing games to the ones that are comparable to this such as Elderscrolls . However , once I left the vault I was completely hooked on this very fun game . You start out in said vault where you learn basic skills that will help you later when traversing the desolate wasteland . You also have the opportunity to build up your stats to your liking and what your character looks like . It took a bit to grasp how to level in this game , but it was rather easy once I figured it out and quite easy to make a warrior of the wasteland suited to your tastes . Your father escapes this vault and you are soon to follow and entering the wasteland for the first time is quite something . I was very impressed with the detail and layout of this land . So I headed for a town called Megaton and used this for my base of operations for the entire game . In the game you complete quests and such to gain experience and earn bottle caps which in this world is the source of money . You can also loot many abandoned places and nearly everything you find can be sold for some more bottle caps . The main quest is somewhat interesting as you follow the footsteps of your father and try to find out what he is trying to do , but quite frankly the other quests not relating to the main one are more fun for the most part . Though I did like the black and white world in the main quest the last quest in the main quest was a bit too easy . Some examples of the optional quests include helping a local write a book on how to survive the wasteland , helping this group who worship a tree , ridding a town of their ant problem and so on and so forth . So for the most part this game is great the fighting is not the best when you do not use this mod called v . a . t . s cause it is rather hard to aim out of it , but it is still rather fun with a very huge arsenal of weapons that you can find and armor too . I just say they needed to do more in the main quest portion of the game , work out some of the bugs as this game froze up a couple of times and a character would not move to where he was supposed to so I had to physically push him , and make the ending a bit more grand in keeping with the rest of the game . Still , for the most part this game was great with a variety of things to do and I was good on this play through next time I am planning on being ultra evil . . . so long Megaton .
548583	1111192	279112	9.0	On second thought this one is very good .	The first time I saw this movie was on the sci-fi channel and the movie had pieces cut from it and it was badly dubbed . I bought the DVD and watched it and it was a lot better than the sci-fi experience . First off the music is great when you listen to it in stereo , secondly the effects are really good for a Godzilla movie . My major complaint it seems was simply Godzilla's appearance in the movie . It is a major jolt when one is used to the Godzilla of the previous two movies , but on seeing it again it looks rather good , and very evil ( still a bit two dumpy , but I got over this time ) . In this movie , Godzilla is on a rampage . . . a rampage where he isn't just stumbling through the city causing damage because of his size , but rather causing damage because he wants to kill the people of Japan and make them suffer . Many of his most deplorable acts were cut from the sci-fi version , but on DVD you get to see him cause lots of pain on purpose . Who can stop the rampaging Godzilla . . . well we have Mothra , Baragon , and King Gidorah , but quite frankly these monsters just can not stand up to the power of this evil super Godzilla . So the military also pitches in with their full arsenal . Very interesting characters abound in a reporter and her military dad and various other interesting people . All of them with one goal : To stop the onslaught of Godzilla .
549077	1111192	385690	9.0	Basically just a longer episode of Family Guy .	That , however , is not a bad thing . . . to many times in these situations the people who make the show may try to do something completely different and it really isn't as good as the show , but here it is . Though really , it is only three unaired episodes of the show with a movie premier scene to bookend them . The first two of these episodes are really funny , with the second stint being my favorite , I just about died at the spider man joke and the thundercats one . The third act is funny , but not quite up to the first two . The main point of the storyline is Stewie as the three episodes sort of have the same theme to them and it looks like it was sort of a three parter with two and three being more of the loop than the first one . Stewie has a near death experience , not only that he has seen a man that looks just like him on the television and he is convinced that it is his real father rather than Peter and this sends him and Brian on a trip to San Francisco . Once there a startling ( well not startling by this show's standards ) is made . Very funny overall , if you like the show you should enjoy this . My main complaint is that it is supposedly uncensored . . . well if that is the case why is the curse words beeped out ?
548450	1111192	82198	9.0	A role perfect for Arnold .	This like the terminator is a role that is just right for Arnold to play . Here he plays a warrior slave who as a child witnessed his mother killed at the hands of James Earl Jones who is a great bad guy here . He is raised as a slave and he becomes a fighter slave . He is one of the best until one day his master frees him . Once freed he meets allies and enemies alike as a king finally catches him after stealing stuff from this tower that worships snakes . The king requests Conan and his two friends to go find his daughter being held by James Earl Jones . At one point Conan is captured and left for dead before they infiltrate the base . Then near the end of the movie there is one heck of a battle between Jone's men and Conan that is really the highlight of the movie . One gripe though is that through the whole movie you expect Jone's character and Conan to have an epic battle . . . the ending is still satisfying even though that doesn't really come about .
548278	1111192	103873	9.0	Dang this one is gory .	Everyone told me this one was extremely gory and they were right . In fact I tend to agree with what the box says saying it is the goriest film of all time . Scary no , gory YES ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! In fact , it is a comedy . . . kind of a Monty Python episode that is really pushing the limits . It is about this guy who is in love with a girl , but his possesive mother tries to get in the way . She follows them to the zoo , gets bit buy a rat-monkey , dies , comes back as a zombie , and infects others . . . you know same ol ' same ol ' . The sad part is that as gory as it was I couldn't help myself from laughing . I just have to see Peter Jackson's Bad Taste as well . . . One thing about this movie though I just can't figure out why the hero of the story takes that baby to the park ( for those who have seen it you know , and for those who haven't I won't spoil it ) .
548359	1111192	120737	10.0	Never read the book , but loved the movie !	I didn't know quite what to expect when I went into the theater , all I knew is that I wanted to see a fantasy film with sword fights , magic and monsters . I was not disappointed . It exceeded my expectations because it had all the stuff I mentioned and great acting , and good character development as well . I was enjoying the movie so much that I was very disappointed when it ended . I would have gladly stayed another six hours if the showed the next two installments of this flick . That was the only bad part of the film is the abrupt ending , but I still give this movie a 10 , because it is a trilogy and I was expecting it . If you want to see a great movie , one that delivers where so many have promised , but failed to deliever then this is the film to see . . . even if you didn't read the book . And for anyone who has read the book I would love to hear your take on the movie , just don't give anything away about the next two parts .
548254	1111192	373074	10.0	A movie with good action , comedy and heart .	When I bought this movie , I was expecting a chuckle or two and to see some pretty good fight scenes . This movie went beyond my expectations and has to be one of the best movies I have seen all year . The comedy had me laughing out loud , the fight scenes were jaw dropping and to top it all off it even had some touching emotional scenes as well . This movie has it all and it comes not from the United States , but rather the far east where they seem to keep making movies that I thoroughly enjoy . This movie has a gang known as the Axe gang terrorizing nearly every corner of the city save for the areas that are poor . That is until an aspiring man who wishes to join the gang literally brings the gang violence to this peaceful little slum town with its many colorful characters , which a few of the residents are kind of well versed in kung fu . We get to see this young man make several stupid mistakes and he seems sort of a klutz , but there also seems to be a hint of greater things . Assassines are sent to deal with those who fought the Axe gang and we get a very strange musical combo and a man who is so well versed in martial arts he is known as the " Beast " . Great fights ensue , but as for the comedy the best part has to be Sing's ( the man who wants to join the Axe gang ) assassination attempt of the landlady of the poor town . So if you like Asian cinema and are in the mood for a movie that basically has a lot of laughs and action then this is definitely the one to check out .
548978	1111192	476680	10.0	Fun first movie based on the cartoon series .	I really enjoyed this flick , however , I probably gave it a higher score than necessary mainly because unlike every Dragonball Z movie , this film actually has a rather good running time of more than an hour and a half . So it has a better developed story , good action scenes , and of course some good comedy as well . The story has our gang having to escort a bit of a spoiled actress to a realm known as the land of snow . However , as easy as this sounds it does not play out this way as a strong gang of ninjas attacks again and again . Seems our actress has a secret and it is up to Naruto and pals to defeat this ninja clad in special armor . The fights are great showcasing all the young ninjas special talents as well as their teacher and there are a couple of surprises along the way as well . The animation is to be expected just like the television show with a few nice visuals along the way . Though I may only be saying this because I love snow and living here in Alabama I haven't seen any first hand in ten years or so . The characters are their usual selves and you will probably find the actress annoying at first then feel for her then dislike her again . The bad guys are typical , nothing to special about them , in fact Gaara from the television show is more menacing and a way better bad guy than any displayed here . Still , I really enjoyed this movie and hope to see the other Naruto movies released soon .
548707	1111192	142235	10.0	Pretty cool and fast paced .	Fast paced is the best way to describe this DBZ movie . Piccolo is apparently killed and Gohan gets kidnapped so Goku goes to the lair of Garlic jr an evil person with ambitions to rule the world , and who has already been granted immortality from the dragon . Battles ensue as Krillin joins the battle to help Goku rescue his son and the thought to be dead Piccolo also appears , but not to help , he just owes the henchmen a little pay back . All in all a pretty cool installment of DBZ .
548694	1111192	109686	10.0	My favorite Farrelly brother comedy .	Yes , I like this one a lot more than Something About Mary , which was pretty good , but this one was so much more funny to me . Mary had great moments , but there were also quite a few slow stretches . . . these are , however , common in all the Farrelly brother movies . Not this one though . This is there only comedy where there virtually are no slow stretches . . . it is one gag after another , never slowing up for a moment at all . Carrey and Daniels are great with each other , they have good chemistry . . . it is to bad the sequel will feature neither of them , which means the sequel will probably suck . The movie is simple enough to follow , as two men of lower intelligence embark on a quest to return a briefcase to a woman . This woman , though , left the briefcase on purpose as it contained a ransom . So the two dummies now have killers on their trail and run into a lot of other misadventures on their quest to return the case . All in all , a very funny flick that is funny all the way through .
548577	1111192	207487	10.0	The game that made me a Final Fantasy fan .	I was not a huge fan of the first Final Fantasy game , however , I loved this game when it was released as Final Fantasy II . It was just vastly different at the time to anything I was used to . I loved the scenes where the characters acted own their own to add to the story , the music seemed great , and the story was very well played out . The fighting was good too , but this game was mainly story based as the story was more important than the fighting . Here it is turned based , and even though today it looks a bit odd seeing basically a picture blink to indicate an attack it is still great in its simplicity . The story follows Cecil who is a dark knight on a quest for redemption and to discover the mystery's of the crystals . He finds many comrades to aid him along the way , and villains to try and obstruct it . You have your basic element villains and other villains who seem to have connections with our heroes . There is nothing like this game still as the story still sparks emotion as there is a lot of self sacrifice to occur . You travel many lands in this one , including the lands of the drawf and you even get to fly into space . You have your humorous characters and you have your super magic attacks and summons . In this one the characters are also all rather unique unlike other final fantasy where there are no real differences between characters . So all in all still one of the best .
548838	1111192	82398	10.0	One of the best .	This and " The Spy Who Loved Me " are my favorite of Moore's Bond movies . This one has the more simpler plot with no one really trying to control the world . It is simply about Bond trying to get a coding device that has sunk in the ocean before the Russians can get to it . Along the way are great car chases , excellent underwater fights , a simple yet effective finale , and much more . The locations are great , the actors are great , this film simply put is great .
548251	1111192	145487	10.0	What I was hoping for and more .	Usually when there is a big summer movie I am looking forward to , I wait and wait and then the movie comes out and it is a big disappointment . I really looked forward to the American Godzilla movie and by golly it was a huge disappointment . Then I really looked forward to Star Wars episode 1 and although it was not the disappointment Godzilla was , it was still a disappointment . Spider-man however was everything I was hoping it to be . In fact , it has to be considered one of the best comic book adaptations ever . It actually took parts of the comic book and incorporated it into the movie . Unlike most comic book movies where the story doesn't come from any of the comic books . Sure there are some departures such as the organic web shooters , but this is acceptable seeing as how watching Peter Parker learning he has them makes for some humorous scenes . The entire cast did a great job capturing the characters they were playing and there are some great fights as well . This is also a departure from most comic book movies where there is really no good fight at all between the heroes and villains .
