548997	1111192	70435	1.0	A name for Yawn !	From what I read in the tv guide it sounded like it might be a rather interesting haunted house movie . Instead it is perhaps one of the most boring movies ever filmed . The plot is muddled and really makes no sense , it is very slow paced , and there are very few instances of supernatural going ons . Instead the most we see is a shadow moving here and there and a stupid horse . This makes " The Amityville Horror " look like an Italian horror film splatter fest . The plot , couple moves into an old house that belonged to the guy's great grandfather . You figure out the rest . Apparently , the ghost is haunting the place , but nothing much happens . Even the end makes very little sense . Why this movie was entitled " A Name For Evil " is beyond me . Well that was the name of the book , but I hope the book had more going on than happened here . I have to say avoid this movie at all cost . It is almost to painful to sit through , you will feel like taking a nap in the middle of it and by golly you will not miss a thing . I can not believe this movie was on amc , because it is not an american classic .
548704	1111192	77834	1.0	Pointless	That is the best way to describe Laserblast . This movie just is nothing . It is about a kid who for some reason is picked on by cops and two dorks , guy finds laser gun and gets revenge . That is about all there is to it . Meanwhile they throw in a couple of plot points that are never worked out in the movie . The kids mom goes on a vacation or something and the kid seems to have issues with this , but it isn't used in the rest of the film . You have a stranger in town who flashes some sort of badge , but you never find out what agency he works for or why he even knows how to search for aliens in the town . Then there are the stupid looking aliens made out of clay . I could design better creatures than that . Then there is the pointless cameo of Roddy McDowell and I am guessing he probably took most of the budget of the film . And enough people have talked about the Star Wars sign blowing up . Anyway if you want to see a plotless movie about a green faced kid stumbling around and blowing up random objects then this is your flick .
548188	1111192	85937	1.0	Oh my god . . . he does the voice of Frosty .	Yes , it has been awhile since I saw this one , but one thing still sticks out . The fact that the guy who does the voice of Frosty the Snowman plays a deranged perv who kills women and eats them . For the most part a very poorly done movie . You would think in a movie that is basically about cannibalism that there would be lots of gore . Not in this one . This one is almost totally a comedy , though it won't make you laugh all that much let me tell ya . A guy whose wife can't cook finally goes berserk and kills her in a rage . He has no recollection of this rage and finds her dead body in the microwave where he decides to heat her up . Let me say this is one big microwave cause her entire body fits in it . Then he grabs something to eat , I think the next day . He accidentally grabs her arm I think and starts chomping away . He finally realizes what he is eating , but it apparently tastes so good he doesn't mind . The ending to this one is pretty out there , but then this entire movie is out there . You keep seeing Frosty going " Happy Birthday " !
548858	1111192	116250	1.0	How did I get dragged to this movie ?	First off , let me say I hate musicals and don't blame me for hating this one as well . I somehow got talked into seeing this one by a friend so if you don't like what I have to say blame him and his ex girlfriend . I just thought this was one of the most boring flicks ever , the songs stunk and the story did as well too . It of course focuses on Eva Peron who the movie makes out to be a saint , I won't go into it since there may be those who are offended by the truth , let's just say she wasn't . Banderos character was sort of the narrator , and he does a lousy job at it as I found myself wondering what the heck was happening . Let's just say I wasn't crying for her at the end as I would have walked out of the theater an hour and a half earlier if my friends weren't my ride . Though it taught me a lesson , don't go to a film you don't want to go to cause you won't enjoy yourself .
548911	1111192	55294	1.0	The phantom planet looks like it is extra crispy	Yes , this is the movie about a mysterious planet that looks a lot like a piece of chicken , extra crispy . . . not original recipe . The plot is a space craft disappears so another one is sent out to find what happened . Well they find a planet . . . one crew member dead the other lands on the planet . There he shrinks down in size when his mask opens and there is a small review of the movie up to that point . What he finds as a small guy is a race of people who really want him to stay to the point of offering him two women to choose from . Well our hero will have none of that , as he wants to go home no matter what , so he disrupts these people's way of life . He argues a lot with one guy who doesn't like the women of the planet swoon over the new boy . . . so they fight by holding a bike rack between them and try to force each other on a tile that can kill . Meanwhile , these dog aliens attack in ships that are on fire and a whole bunch of stuff happens and later we get to see a recap of the entire movie . All in all this is one to avoid , except on MST3k .
548539	1111192	94074	1.0	This is just terrible .	Simply put that is how I describe this one . None of the Supermans are really great , but they are ok . This one is just awful . . . I mean where do I begin . I might as well start with the budget . . . It just had to be extremely low . His flying looked worse in this than in the first one . Then there is the acting Reeve goes beyond mediocre in this one . . . here he sucks . I am guessing it was the director's job that made him tolerable in the first three . Not that anyone does a good job in this one including Gene Hackman who is also awful and just why did the feel the need to have Jon Cryer play his nephew ? Then the scientific errors . Somehow a strand of Superman's hair can hold up all this weight . . . I think it was a ton , but Lex Luthor cuts it with bolt cutters . Nuclear man takes a girl into space where there is plenty of air for her to breath apparently . And speaking of the villan , did they try to make him as lame as possible or what . This of course has to do with the plot , a whole movie devoted to telling us a nuclear war would be bad . . . Duh ! If Reeve thought this movie was going to cause world leaders to say " Gee , we shouldn't start a war and maybe we should disarm " , then he was fooling himself .
548949	1111192	89280	1.0	This Movie fails . . . on so many levels .	No matter how you look at this movie , it is just awful . If you view it as a horror , then it is an unscary movie with the monsters being hand puppets . If you look at it as a comedy , then you will notice most of the humor falls flat and is just lame . If it is a romance you will wonder why a guy would stay with such a Bch ! If you look at it as an action you can't really pull for the whiny hero . As you can see this movie just fails to deliver anything remotely entertaining . As mentioned the monsters are obvious puppets and this film was another attempt at a Gremlins type movie . This however has the worst looking monsters of that genre . Critters looked pretty good , so did the Ghoulies , heck even the puppets from the Munchies looked better than these . The characters in this film are thouroughly unlikable . The hero is a whiney security guard , his girlfriend is always complaining , they have a tramp friend who has a jerk military boyfriend , and another friend who is a spaz . At one point in the movie the hero and the military guy fight with rakes . . . this movie is just utterly stupid . I like the scene when they are in the dreaded club scum ( which is obviously not a club , but more likely a diner ) and the hero tells the waitress that none of them are 21 . Give me a break , I am 25 and I look younger than any of them .
548167	1111192	55562	1.0	Dang , those kids can run .	This movie is about ineffective aliens trying to take over the earth . In their way is Space Chief ( though he isn't in the movie much at all ) . Really kind of lame as the story focusses on these kids who run from one place to another endlessly . In the end you just don't worry to much that the Neptune men are going to take over the planet .
548193	1111192	81693	1.0	This was made in 1980 ?	Watching this one I thought early 70's late 60's , but this was released in 1980 ? This is a very bad film , it is really sad to see Donald Pleasence in this one , forced to dress in one stupid outfit after another . And what is up with the superheros costume . I have never seen a hero in slacks , a stupid shirt , and a fruity cape before . What is worse is his constant whinning , I was rooting for Donald to take over the world . And since when do pumas fly anyway ? Am I thinking of the right animal ? And I love it when he senses danger , he never senses it when people are right on him , but rather hours before hand it seems . Don't watch this one unless you watch the MST 3000 version .
549125	1111192	61759	1.0	A bit of a mess .	This movie is one big motorcycle accident . The plot is awful the cast is awful , everything in this one is awful . A guy's brother is killed so he and his brother's fiance infiltrate a biker gang to look for the his killers . There aren't as many biker chicks as the tagline and title suggest and we mainly see a bunch of people act drunk and once in a while we can understand what they are saying . It is an even worse movie than " Sidehackers " another Ross Hagen movie .
548721	1111192	91338	2.0	Don't watch the television cut of this movie .	When watching a horror movie on a station other than HBO or one of those stations it is expected to have some scenes removed because they are a bit graphic or may contain nudity . This movie went overboard though and a couple of times I didn't know what happened or how a person was killed the cuts were so bad . This movie has this gal setting up a party in a house that is apparently haunted . She sets up a whole lot of elaborate pranks that play during the party even setting up a guillotine which she never actually does . Then somebody in an old divers outfit starts killing everyone in sight with jump cuts . Or they are so fast that you just don't see what the heck happened . In one scene these two guys are apparently killed at the same time , but I didn't see what happened . One minute they were sitting there talking the next they were slouched over dead . I may have to review this again if I ever see the uncut version , but all I can say about this one is don't watch it .
549127	1111192	49516	2.0	Unintentially funny .	Even without mystery science theater this one would still be full of laughs . It starts with a professor of some sort explaining all this theories of what is in the center of the earth , and boy are they not even close to the truth . Then you meet the troops as John Agar and the Beaver's dad and the rest of the team are doing research on artifacts . They find something that prompts them to climb the mountain and then one of the men falls down a hole so you get to watch men climbing down a hole for a good ten minutes . Then they get trapped and stumble upon an ancient civilization underground ruled by white elves in dumb costumes . Of course the logic in this movie is a bit suspect as the men probably didn't go down more than a hundred feet and they were on a mountain so I doubt the place could have been as big as made out to be . The mole people look especially stupid , but at least there clothes look more normal than the elves . And the one seen where the elf people are whipping the mole men does sort of make you wanna sing that old Devo song . And watch for the old man who does nothing , but slow Agar and the Beaver's dad down with his constant whinning .
548253	1111192	88206	2.0	Good choice for Supergirl , but the plot is not good .	This is one painful movie to watch . The only character to cross over from Superman is the guy who played Jimmy Olsen and you can see why no one else would want to be seen in this one . They seem to change a lot of things around that were clearly established in the Superman series and then there is the horrible plot as well . Supergirl played by Helen Slater who is probably a good choice to play the role must retrieve a ball that keeps her people alive in inner space or something . All I know is that Supergirl somehow gets to earth by way of a lake . The ball falls into the hands of Faye Dunaway who somehow knows how to use it and she does all sorts of evil things as she is trying to get a younger guy to like her ( kind of desperate , eh ? ) . She somehow even sends Supergirl to the phantom zone . . . in Superman it was a mirror in space ; here it is an entire world . All in all this one just suffers from a really bad script and very bad overacting as well . I have only seen the original theatrical release however , and not the 140 minute cut which may explain a few of my complaints .
548902	1111192	97778	3.0	Look who is puking .	That would be me . I just can't stand these types of movies where you hear the movie from a baby's perspective . Well I guess this trilogy is the only movies that do that . This movie for the most part , for me , wasn't very funny . The only character worth a few laughs in this one was George Segals character as he has some scenes that were capable of making me chuckle . All in all though this story of a mother and her son just is awful . Too much cutesy stuff in it , but then what do you expect from a movie with a baby on the cover ? Travolta plays a taxicab driver / pilot and really isn't very good here and Kristie Alley is the mother of Mickey the baby voiced by Bruce Willis .
549161	1111192	91225	3.0	This duck simply was destined not to fly .	This movie was a bomb when it was released , but fortunately over the years it has attained a sort of cult following so there are people who enjoy this film . I am not one of them , however , I found this movie a bit boring with a rather stupid concept . Not that it doesn't have anything to it , I actually chuckle at some of it , overall though it is not much of a ride . I have to agree with the one reviewer that said one of the problems with this movie is that it looks cheap . Which is surprising considering we have the man who made the Star Wars trilogy behind this film . Unfortunately , you can't tell he had anything to do with this movie as the effects look like a cheap science fiction television show's special effects . The duck , the star of the show is annoying and the star of the show should not be a character you tire of hearing from during the course of the movie . Then there is the switch in the flick from a bit of a comedy to strange alien invasion movie that adds seriousness and action to a movie that would have probably benefited greatly from more comedy and a change in the way Howard spoke . Then the movie ends with a rock concert ending that is so lame you will roll your eyes and turn off your tape or change the channel before it finishes . It is funny though that I think this movie originated from a comic book . At the time there were so many comic books that had yet been translated to the big screen , I wonder why they decided to make this one ?
548695	1111192	120762	3.0	Another one I got dragged to .	My friend is for some reason a big Disney fan . . . he sees all the movies and somehow he always finds a gal that is really into Disney too . From time to time , he somehow drags me to one of these Disney movies . I have a policy of I will go to any movie as long as someone pays my way . So I got dragged to this one and man , I didn't find it all that enjoyable . If it wasn't for the character Eddie Murphy voiced I would have had a completely lousy time indeed . His character though does do some funny things so I was able to tolerate it better . This one has a girl pretending to be a guy in order to help her father who is drafted to serve , but is very old . Of course , in this type of movie the girl does great in the army and becomes a better soldier than all the guys as is typical with these kinds of movies . In the end I was able to sit through this one , but I wouldn't want to see it again . I have never really been a big fan of Disney movies , even when I was a kid so maybe I should revise my you pay I'll go policy .
548437	1111192	89200	3.0	What a great ad campaign can do .	This movie made a nice sum of 35 million at the box office , yet many consider it a poor movie at best . So how did it make this much money ? With a good ad campaign , that's how . This movie was the first small creature attack movie to come out after the very successful Gremlins the previous year . Critters , which most consider the better film , came out a year later and made a lot less than this one . Then there was the famous scene of the creature coming out of the toilet . It made it look like a Gremlin type movie . . . funny with a bit of charm to it . It fooled my parents and we saw this dog in the theater when I was ten . We knew it wasn't quite what it was advertised as though as soon as it started as it has a scene where a guy rips out a woman's heart . It isn't all bad though as there are some scenes here and there that are good , but overall this one is just bad as it is not just about little creatures , but a bunch of other satanic stuff as well as this guy throws a party and does rituals and accidentally raises this one evil guy . Sounds better than it is though as there are no stars in this one and none of the actors in this one can act . You do though get to see the little person who played ET .
548411	1111192	475417	3.0	Well the plot summary made it sound like it would be good .	I thought this movie would be the best film of the new Afterdark releases , however , upon watching it I am hoping that is not the case . It had promise and for a second there I thought it would be good , but it just has way to many flaws . I will get to them later , but first the plot . Something is unearthed in a cave and goes on the rampage , a sheriff with a past is on the case . A truck isolates the town leaving four strangers in town stranded , monster begins rampage . An Indian girl and this other guy seem to know a way to stop it and there is some cat and mouse as the survivors and their decreasing numbers hide here and there . So what are its flaws ? First , the whole sheriff with a past thing . It is a female sheriff and she had an incident that was so troubling to her that she has been drinking and having problems for a year . A plot straight out of a lifetime channel movie plot . Do not get me wrong and I am not disparaging the channel , but those types of plot points do not belong in horror movie of this type . Also , when it is revealed what she did you will wonder how the heck she has stayed sheriff for a year . It did seem to be because of incompetence on her part and I don't see how anyone could have let her be sheriff after that . She is also way to pretty for someone who has been drinking for a year and living under the sun . Most would have developed wrinkles and would have aged considerably , however she is still quite modelesque . Then there are the four strangers in town , never before has there been four more pointless and underdeveloped characters to enter a movie . You know not their motivations , or anything . The girl bit by the rattler , her friend , the city dude , and the broken down hitchhiker . Heck , you learn more about the trucker whose rig crashes five minutes into the movie than you do any of the four strangers . However , all is not bad as there are a couple of good kills . . . the dude in the car at the end and the girl in the café . The one rancher is actually a good character , to bad he is not in the movie much and the monster is okay too , although it is just a cheap version of the alien and its origin is a bit far fetched .
548894	1111192	117705	3.0	This one plays more like a Muppets movie .	This movie was really bad . The only saving graces are Bill Murray and Larry Bird's all to brief appearances . We have definitely found something Jordan can't do and that is act . That is kind of bad considering he is playing himself in this one . Though most of his costars weren't there , so it might have been difficult . At least he stopped after this one unlike Shaq who made four or five pictures . . . Thank God Phil Jackson came along and refocused him . As for the plot being like a Muppets movie it is . A few appearances here and there from a surprise celebrity , the whole working with live actors . It just did not seem to be a Looney tunes movie . Though they stopped being Looney a long time ago . I liked Daffy Duck when he was , well , daffy . . . he has been smart aleck duck for a while now . It just doesn't feel right . All the Looney Tunes on one team , some being life long enemies . . . and what is the point of introducing the bad guy voiced by I think Danny DeVito . The Martian has always been trying to take over the world , why not just let it be him . Also , what is up with the girl bunny ? Why introduce a new character ? I guess we just had to be politically correct . Well this one may be good for the kiddies , but most of us are going to recognize it for what it is . . . one long commercial . I saw a clip from the next Looney Tunes movie and it is even more Muppet looking than this one
549105	1111192	91129	3.0	How did this movie do so well ?	I am guessing the reason this movie did so well at the box office is of course Eddie Murphy . I think this was his first movie since " Beverly Hills Cop " so at the time he was hot . Considering that one made over two hundred million and it was R and this one made about 80 million and it was pg does say it was not all that popular . I have never been a big Eddie Murphy fan , so that is probably another reason I didn't care for it much at all . This one has Eddie as some sort of finder of lost kids . He must find the golden child or the world is in terrible peril . The plot is very bad , but as bad as it is it does not compare to the special effects . I had seen better stuff done in the 70's than some of the stuff this one offers , Ray Harryhausen did better stuff . Still the main reason you see a movie like this is because of Eddie , unfortunately he is not very funny in this one at all and it just seems stupid to put him in the " Raiders of the Lost Ark " type scenes . I guess they were hoping for a fish out of water effect , but to me it just did not work .
548643	1111192	72869	3.0	Well it had one hell of a finish . . .	Most of the movie is sadly rather underdone . Seems they had a somewhat interesting concept and just rushed it to the finish line . I am guessing they thought of the ending first and wrote a bunch of filler to get to said ending . So what do we get for most of the film ? A rather good cast doing nothing more than going out to the abandoned town and getting themselves kidnapped by the evil cult led by Ernest Borgainine in a rather good over the top performance . You know a movie is in trouble when it seems they are rushing things so no startling revelations here , only lets rush to the cool ending . Which is the highlight of the film , a rain that comes down and washes the cult members away , rather good effects , especially for the time , but this does not make up for the rest of the film . Which leads to a question I have , why are movies about Satan and his cults usually so bloody boring or bad for the most part ? You would think these movies would be some of the most gory and scary the horror genre had to offer , but usually it falls flat . Still if you do watch the movie look out for the many stars who apparently had nothing else better to do .
548952	1111192	103923	3.0	Captain America falls flat .	I am like the other reviewer who saw the poster of this in a theater , oddly enough I think I was there to see Batman Returns . The poster was a picture of his shield and I said that might be cool , but alas this movie would never make it to the big screen . The problem is they apparently ran out of money after the first scene . Captain America goes after the Red Skull beating up Nazi soldiers then totally gets beaten up by the skull that doesn't look like a skull , but it is still creepy . Cap gets tied to a rocket which is launched at the White House then he diverts it to Alaska . After this the budget runs out and the middle is just the guy without his costume running around in modern America . The skull is still around and he now looks like a guy with a bad sunburn and he is trying to kidnap the Pres . There is a little action at the end , but it is not as good as the promising beginning . Cap does get to beat up the skull at the end too , but the guy has to be pretty old at this point so it isn't really a fair fight . The costume is pretty good and the guy looks like Captain America , but he is kinda whiney . This film isn't very good , but a worse Marvel movie is The Punisher , they couldn't even get the costume right in that one .
548182	1111192	99512	3.0	Same old Ernest with jokes that make one roll their eyes and groan .	Yes , I had the misfortune of watching this film when I was younger at a friends house as his mother was a teacher and she wanted to screen the movie and see if there were any inappropriate scenes that a parent might object to . Well other than the unfunny jokes I think this one was in the clear , well the unfunny jokes and the strange scene where the look a like Ernest hits on a girl . So yes , Ernest gets thrown in jail thanks to a look a like and proceeds to try to escape and there is other stuff to it like him becoming magnetized at one point , shooting electricity , and in a very painful to watch finale flying . There are a couple of jokes , but nothing to much to mention except for the gun carved from soap . . . I think that is the only scene me or my friend's mother laughed out loud at . This and camp are the only two Ernest movies I have ever seen and from what I have seen in them I am not going to track down the other films . Ernest was good in small doses , but a movie is just to much even when it is as short as this one . I figure though the films made money , mainly because all you need is Varney and a location and a theme and you have your movie .
548711	1111192	68271	4.0	It was better when I was a kid .	I saw this movie as a kid and loved it . . . unlike the original Blob this one seemed to have a lot more kills . Then one night I saw it on amc and boy it was a very slow moving movie . There weren't as many kills as I had remembered and now being an adult you can tell that in some scenes the blob is nothing more than a balloon or something being inflated . This one also tries to be comedic in places and most of the humor falls flat . Then there are extended scenes where you know the blob is going to attack , but you keep waiting and waiting and finally an attack you can't see very well ( the scene with the couple in the drain pipe comes to mind ) . All in all it had some good qualities , but it just isn't much to watch . Though I did like the scene with the hippie getting his hair shampooed .
548166	1111192	173840	4.0	Very , very dull .	This movie was not at all what I expected it to be . This movie I found to be very boring . I love the video games and I was expecting this to be a fun movie , instead I found a movie that had absolutely no connection at all with the game series that took itself way to seriously . None of the games take place on the earth as we know it , but this does , the only monsters are phantoms , there is no well defined bad guy , and I could go on and on . You would think they could have lifted the plot from one of the games , instead of the boring one they used . The action scenes were pretty good , but there were just to many scenes where they just sat around discussing things . Also , the animation was great at times , but at others it looked as if they were moving underwater . There were many inconsistances concerning the monsters , too . At the beginning they would infect a person , then it was like they were stealing your soul . All in all I was really disappointed with this flick , they should have stayed more true to the game or at least named it something else .
548908	1111192	118615	4.0	Cheesy snake movie .	CGI is a great tool for some movies . . . this is not one of them . The snake in most scenes is so fake looking that they might as well made the entire movie a cartoon for crying out loud . There are some watchable areas though . . . Jon Voight is rather good , so is Owen Wilson and a couple of the other cast members , especially considering this is a giant snake movie . Lopez ( who is an awful actress and singer ) and Ice Cube aren't very good . All the snake attack scenes suck and aren't very believable at all . Well I might as well say it ; none of the scenes with our title character are very good . I got most queasy when Voight cut Stolz's throat to help him breath for crying out loud . This is a pretty good movie though to make fun of so you can have some fun watching it anyway .
548196	1111192	118688	4.0	Why did they make it so campy ? ? ?	This could have been a good movie , but Joel Shuemauker really botched up . The only reason I gave this movie a 4 on the 10 rating is I liked the first ten or so minutes of action , then it was just a boring , goofy movie . To me it looks like they followed the same blueprint as they did for Batman forever , but added more gags . Arnold would have been perfect for Mr . Freeze if they portrayed him the way the cartoon series did , as an emotionless killer who wanted revenge on those who killed his wife . Instead we get Arnold saying the most stupid one-liners I have ever heard " Tonights forecast , a hard freeze " . O'Donnel as Robin was really annoying this time too . He was a whiny pain , instead of a help to Batman , and Silverstone was bad too . I mean in the comic , in the stupid tv show , and in the cartoon she is Commissioner Gordon's daughter , now she is Alfred's niece ? And she races bikes , does this give people super crime fighting skills ? I loved the first one , thought the second was ok , and liked the third , but it is time to change the costume . I mean I don't see how the bad guys keep losing considering how constricting the costume is . Thanks to this most of the fight scenes fall flat . There are more problems but I won't go into them all .
548901	1111192	83866	4.0	Liked it at first .	As a kid my parents burned me out taking me to this film . Every day they wanted to get rid of my sister and me for the day they took us to E . T . By the third or fourth time , I really began not to really care for this movie to the point of being incapable of wanting to watch it again . The story is simple though and good for kids to watch . Even as a kid though I got quickly bored of this on and today I never want to see it again . I will say I really enjoyed it the first and second time I saw it , but I have to say this movie is definitely for kids and they will get the most enjoyment of seeing Elliot help the little alien call his friends to pick him up . This movie was also a really big advertisement for the candy Reese's pieces . . . they were basically unheard of before this movie .
548324	1111192	183005	4.0	What is the plot ? Well you will never know if you want to win .	Yes , as with all Sega CD movie games featuring actors this game has a fatal flaw that is common theme with about all of them . This one seems to have better actors than most and it has rather interesting gameplay though rather simplistic . You basically use security cameras to monitor rooms , you have mob type dudes and ninjas are something and when they step on certain points on the screen you push a button and trigger a trap and they get bonked or fall in a hole or something . It is somewhat fun watching them fall in these traps and seeing the different types of traps , but it does get old . As for the fatal flaw you ask ? Well you have scenes going on while you are monitoring the rooms , explaining motivations for some of the characters and such . Well if you take the time to listen to these scenes you lose the game as to many of the intruders will break in . What is the point of filming these scenes with this actors and actresses if you can not watch them ? So you end up just catching random people without really knowing what the heck is going on , however the ending is kind of funny as you put Eddie ( Corey Haim's character ) through some real hell .
548235	1111192	104139	4.0	When someone is killed with a giant band aid you know the movie is lame .	This movie is of course about a crazed doctor . He was in a mental hospital , but he escapes and he goes off to do some surgery . He finds a girl who suffers from some sort of heart ailment and this reminds him of his mother so he wants to help her . Along the way you get to see him kill people in rather stupid ways to get their hearts . Had potential , but ultimately this one gets to goofy at times for its own good . Some scenes though are rather gory such as the flashback scene where they show how the kid managed to escape , but in the end these scenes are too few and far between . If you see it you may want to watch it just to say you saw it if you are a fan of horror , but nothing to really search hard for .
548900	1111192	55614	4.0	It is well made , but I just don't like musicals .	My friend wanted me to watch this movie , even though he knows I hate musicals . I will have to say this is one of the better ones I have seen , but I still didn't care for it for the most part . It is basically a remake of " Romeo and Juliet , and that doesn't help as I don't care for Shakespeare that much either . The movie is at its best when no one is singing or dancing , but this is coming from someone who doesn't like those things in his movie . So if you like musicals check this one out , because if I could take it , then you should really enjoy it . I also didn't care much for the ending and how they got to that point . That guy should have just stayed away from the whole rumble .
549014	1111192	84090	4.0	This one adds a new twist to Alien rip-offs .	This movie is basically an " Alien " rip-off for the most part , but it does have some differences . This one has an alien kill some people and rape a woman then it is no more . What the heck ? Is this one of the shortest movies ever ? No , the woman who was raped is now carrying alien offspring and she must feed her little critters blood . There was a movie made later that had just about the same concept only it was set on earth and in modern times . This one is set in space and boy they do not really follow science at all in this one . Still though it is better than some Alien clones , but it is still not all that great . For the most part , in fact , it is pretty bad . However , it is watchable at least . I have only seen the cut version , I would imagine the only thing that was cut down was the rape scene because I don't remember all that much . The kills are pretty standard and the ending is fairly predictable if you are a horror fan . Another movie this reminds me of , but just a bit , is " The Beast Within " . That one had a woman raped in it to and she carried the child though that one was a lot better done than this .
548373	1111192	103644	4.0	The bitch may be back , but it sure is boring .	This is by far my least favorite entry into the Alien franchise and that includes " Alien vs Predator " . There is nothing new or innovative about this installment except for the fact that the alien is mixed with a dog or something . Lets just say this one plays out like the first one , but it is not as involving or as interesting . Weaver goes through the motions and that is the shame because she is the only actor you will recognize here with the exception of Lance . The story , Ripley lands on a space prison , alien tagged along , it starts killing , and the startling revelation why said alien will not kill her . Of course evil people want to use the alien again for weapon purposes . Why ? Who knows , but I think it would be obvious by this time that the aliens are simply killing machines , and they are incapable of being trained . The ending is the lone bright spot here , but I was bored out of my mind by the time it rolled around . I can't believe this one ranks higher than four , which by admission is a bit goofy at times , but it is a much faster ride than this slow plodded yawn fest .
549131	1111192	70694	4.0	Nice idea , but kind of a mess .	This movie had to have had a very miniscule budget , because it looks very poor . Everything in this one looks very shoddy , it doesn't help that the company that put this one on dvd looks like they got a copy of this movie on vhs back when tapes first came out and just transferred it to dvd without making any improvements , or cleaning it up . The story could have been interesting , but it really falls apart in the end with a very long flashback scene that is very poorly done . The end also is kind of confusing as I was wondering about this and that . You will know who committed the murders , but you won't know a couple of the other details . On the plus side this one moves very fast and is relatively short . John Carradine is in this one , in a rather small role . For some reason he doesn't talk and only rings a bell or writes on a pad to tell people stuff . This is a waste as Carradine has a very distinguished voice . The Christmas decorations here and there don't look very good either , as they look like they were just draped here and there without much thought as to where they would go . All in all , I won't say stay away from this one , just don't expect too much .
548999	1111192	110770	5.0	Mild thriller . . . really not much on horror .	First , from the looks of things this movie was an actual theater release which is a bit surprising . It looks and feels like a made for television movie , when I first saw it on USA network I thought it was a movie they made . Second , why is it listed as a horror movie ? It is not very horrific at all . It is a rather mild thriller about a crazy paper boy who becomes really attached to this mother and daughter , so much so that he does everything in his power to make them like him . If anyone tries to warn the mother , then he deals with them . Here is a movie where you just want to beat the snot out of the stalker character ; it drives you crazy at what he gets away with . It also makes me glad I don't have a person that likes me that much . Sure some days I wish a gal would form some sort of crush on me , but then you see some of the possible results of such an unhealthy obsession . All in all though this movie is not good , and it is not bad . It is just a mediocre thriller worth a look see if you see it on the television .
549034	1111192	339987	5.0	Novel at first , but it got a bit stale .	This game has you as a main character going to a new town and setting up a home . You get to meet your various animal neighbors and do a few things such as fishing or bug collecting . You progress in real time so whatever day it is on your gamecube it is that time in animal crossing . For awhile this is somewhat fun , however , over time the game seemed more like a chore than a fun game to play . If I decorated my house wrong I was blasted , the animals kept expecting you to visit . What really got on my nerves is that at first new animals would move in and that was neat and then some would move away , but after awhile the only ones that would move out was the newest one that just came . I would have liked it to be more random . Also , the fishing and stuff got old and I would have liked a few more things to do . They had special days when there would be festivals in town and I thought maybe you could do some new things then , but all you can do is watch the other animals do stuff while you just do your stuff as normal . Also , I am a night person and I would have liked to see at least one habitant of the town not be in bed after a certain time leaving me to wander the town alone . Still , I am betting if you had a friend who had a town and you could visit this game would have been more fun . All in all it has its moments , but for me it wore thin , however it did have me hooked for a bit . So I will not say avoid it , I just think it is a case of it not being for me .
548498	1111192	91778	5.0	The dangers of drinking the worm in tequilla graphically displayed .	This sequel was okay at the theater when I saw it , but it wasn't great . Kind of an average film that adds plot points that really are a bit weak . We find out in this one that it was not necessarily the fact the little community was sitting on an old cemetery that was the problem in the first one , but rather that the house was over some burial ground of a cult . There is also this really old man that is a bit creepy wandering around looking for Carol Anne and the Freeling clan . I just think they wanted to add a more physical enemy , someone you could focus on . The family is now living with grandma , but strange stuff starts happening again . For some reason they want Carol Anne . An Indian guy comes to their aid and gives them advice and there are a series of happenings , but this one just isn't as good as the first one as it is very slow in places . The ending was just plain lame and only makes this one worse than it is . As not good as this is though , the next Poltergeist makes this one look a lot better . Some good scenes here and there , but ultimately this one disappoints . Though there is that memorable scene with the worm .
549032	1111192	397056	5.0	Underdeveloped launch game for the Playstation 2 .	It has been awhile since I have played it , but seeing all the systems being launched recently reminded me of the playstation two launch titles of which this is one . The game is a bit of an action role playing game , something like a Zelda in places , however , it is also rather short and you are left with a game that seems rushed to the finish line , like most launch games are . The most unique thing about this game was the fact when you equipped stuff on your character it would be on them in the game from shoes , to helmet to weapon . The story is a bit of a mess as I did not really get what was going on as two characters who I think are brother and sister are transported to a realm of a lost kingdom , the sister years earlier the boy is now grown up . They arrive though at the same time . So you must fight your way through this place , I think a wizard was involved and you end up completely confused . The fighting is okay , nothing ground breaking there , and for the most part your interaction with other characters is very limited , not much in the way of a role playing game in this aspect . Still it had its moments and the graphics were okay , though I am betting the playstation one could have handled it for the most part , though it would have been rougher around the edges . I can not believe there was a part two . So here and there some of it was good , and it did have some nifty music at the start screen .
548200	1111192	81353	5.0	For the most part the casting was good .	It is the story that suffers here . Popeye and Olive are perfectly cast . Robin Williams plays Popeye very well , and if ever there was a role for Duvall it is that of Olive . They should have gotten someone better known though to play Bluto , but unfortunately he isn't really that big of a player in this one considering how important he is in the cartoons . Here in lies the problem with this flick , the story is awful for the most part . Something about Popeye coming to a sea town to find his father . Bluto is a bit to quiet and mean in this movie as well . In the cartoon he was talkative and friendly and sometimes even best friends with Popeye . Here , he is almost evil . This movie also has a few songs so it is sort of a musical too . This may not turn some off , but I am not wild about musicals .
548760	1111192	865556	5.0	Had potential , but man that Monkey King thing was quite lame .	The Monkey King aspect of the story and the whole Shia Labeuf look-a-like getting transported to the kingdom from Boston part . There were great fights with the highlight easily being the duel between Jackie Chan character and Jet Li . Unfortunately , this occurs maybe halfway through and the rest of the movie cannot compare to this martial arts sequence . Though the trip through the desert had a rather funny sequence in it . The story , kid transported back in time to China where he must deliver a staff to the Monkey King , and yes that is Jet Li in his most stupid role ever . You can not take any of the fights this guy is in seriously cause he has dumb makeup on and he frolics . Well the kid runs into Chan's character who is the master of the drunken fist and he helps the kid begin his quest where they run into a strange martial arts girl and another Jet Li character who seems to be a thief , but turns out to be a help . They are all on their way to the Jade Warlord in hopes of freeing said Monkey King . I am guessing whoever wrote this must watch Naruto cause it contained a monkey king that turned into a staff and he watched Mortal Kombat II cause that one villain gal looked just like a character from it with her white hair . So you get so so fights for the most part , a kid who is a bit annoying and who has a very predictable fight at the end , and one very intense fight that everyone wanted to see between Chan and Li . I hope they make another movie together , but in that one I want Chan as a cop and Li as some sort of crime boss . At the end they have a climatic battle in some sort of factory that makes cars or makes steel . Now that would be great !
549129	1111192	71396	5.0	This one needs more . . . lags a bit to much in places .	This movie sounded really cool , so I jumped at the chance to buy it . Unfortunately , it wasn't what I was hoping for . It has its moments , but there are just a bit too many scenes that just hang around the house . The story is about a town that has strange things happening . All the scenes in town are good and a bit spooky , but this movie keeps focusing on this gal in town looking for her father and this dude and his two women who kind of invite themselves to stay at her house . There are some deaths in the movie , and the DVD box said not to watch this on a full stomach , but there is nothing that is that graphic in this movie . In fact , if the deaths were just a tad more graphic it would have helped the movie a bit . I don't mean chicken livers and stuff from an Italian zombie flick , but a little blood would have been nice . Especially in the grocery scene . I mean this zombies jump on a girl and I guess they were supposedly eating her , but there was really nothing there to indicate this . I think they blew the blood budget on the first death in the movie . The other problem of this one is the ending . It is a bit anticlimactic as it is basically the girl narrating a few scenes with nothing really being shown . Quite a letdown as the movie had finally picked up and then it just died down . All in all it isn't a great movie , but it is worth checking out . It has its good points and scenes my favorite of which is the movie theater scene . Just needed a bit more .
548771	1111192	89927	6.0	This Rocky is a bit much , but still okay .	Yes , this Rocky takes aim at the cold war between the US and Russia or USSR that was taking place during the time of this movie . This one is also more over the top than part three and just not realistic at all . Still , those training sequences in this movie as well as parts of the fight really get one's blood pumping . The movie has a Russian boxer coming to America to take on any challenger bold enough to go head to head with him . For some reason , this infuriates Apollo and he is the one to challenge the Russian . Well the fight occurs and tragedy occurs , to much tragedy we lose one of the most interesting and fun Rocky characters when all he had to to was lose and maybe get partially paralyzed or something . Apollo dying just mirrored Mickey's death in the previous movie to much . Well now Rocky wants revenge and he is going to Russia to fight the monster that killed his friend . Great training scenes occur and Rocky and the monster fight . The fight is a bit much , but still cool . This movie has a fast flow , so despite its flaws it is an okay film .
548158	1111192	86014	6.0	Four horror tales to fright and delight you !	Not the best anthology movie made , but it was somewhat good . I liked " Creepshow " and " Cat's Eye " better , but this one is on par with " Twilight Zone : the Movie " . There are other anthology movies that this one is a lot better than . For one it has a good number of stories , though in the end they are a little like episodes of the show " Tales from the Darkside " . The first one is based on an urban myth as a woman goes out for cigarettes on a night some crazed mental patient is on the loose . I can't really say much more or I will end up ruining the ending ( which you will know if you ever heard the myth like I have ) . The next story is the best one in my book , mainly because I play a lot of video games . It features a young Emilo Estevez as this really good game player . He is obsessed with this one game called " The Bishop of Battle " . He wants to get to this level that no one has ever gotten too , and one night he breaks into the arcade and he makes it to the level and let's just say he is in for a surprise at what the mystery level contains . The third story is about a priest who has lost his faith . He is driving in the desert where he is confronted by a mysterious truck with tinted windows . They do a cat and mouse routine through the desert terrain . Finally , we have the story of a couple who have a small rat problem . This anthology movie is not going to blow you away , but the tales are good enough to be rather entertaining .
548244	1111192	97428	6.0	Followed the first one too much .	This sequel to the successful movie Ghostbusters was itself , pretty successful . In the end though it did not do as well and just seemed a little flat . The story of the slime was pretty good and it was funny seeing them do kid's birthday parties ( though I doubt a kid at that time would have watched He-man cartoons ) . In the end this movie suffers from the fact that it follows the basic structure of the first movie so there is nothing really different about it . You have them investigating something , you have them dispatching a ghost , then you have the musical interval , then you have them locked up ( in a loony bin this time ) , then you have a building taken over by the head ghost , and finally you have a giant thing walking through New York . It just seems to me that with ghosts and other things , you could come up with a totally original and funny script without having to follow what worked in the previous chapter . It is a shame too , that another Ghostbusters will probably never be made . It would be interesting to see it , considering all the advancements in special effects .
548357	1111192	82966	6.0	Shut up Kid !	I relize it isn't the kid's fault , but I am here to tell you the voice he is dubbed with is so annoying that it almost ruins the entire flick . Can't a more appropiate voice be found , one that sounds like a real child and not one of those really wealthy ones . Other than that this isn't that bad of a flick , but it definately has some flaws . The movie seems to point this way and that , there are a ton of questions like who is the killer , has the father been in the town before , who is the babysitter really , and others . Unfortunately , only one of these questions is answered in this flick and it is the killer . The rest goes unanswered and where as the unanswered questions work in " The Beyond " here you wonder why it is brought up in the first place if you are never going to find out . Also to all the people that talk about the baby sitter wiping up the blood , I do believe the mother thought the blood came from the dreaded bat attack . One thing I can't believe though is that this movie has a higher rating than " Zombie " . Zombie just seems to me to be a more complete movie .
548850	1111192	67992	6.0	Could be remade as a horror .	I enjoyed this movie as a child , but looking back on it today it is almost a step or two away from being a horror movie . The strange red-faced people , children meeting with unfortunate accidents , and that boat scene . . . whoa ! In the end though this was a pretty good movie for kids even if it didn't really teach them very good lessons . I mean come on ; three of the kids weren't exactly that bad . . . only the spoiled brat deserved some punishment . In this movie though it is apparently evil to want to be a TV star , a fat kid , and someone who chews gum . The story is about a contest to get into the chocolate factory and of course the kids above win a chance , and so does the poor kid Charlie . Though considering how many kids have accidents in the factory they would have been better off in a knife warehouse . The red-faced dudes are a bit annoying , but Gene Wilder turns in an excellent performance . . . but what the heck is up with that scene on the boat ? All in all a good movie for children . . . one question though , how much stuff in that one room full of candy was actually edible ?
548304	1111192	95990	6.0	More of a comedy this time around .	This was an ok sequel to the original . Though I liked the first one much better . This time around one of those drums from the first one falls off a truck and these kids open it , once again awakening the living dead . This time around though , it is definitely more of a comedy than a horror . The first one had quite a bit of comedy in it , but in the end I would say it was more horror . . . this one has very little horror in it . A kid , his sister , and I think a TV or cable repairman must try to escape the living dead . There is also an old guy who was a doctor . There are also two grave robbers who are the exact two guys who released the chemicals in the first one and a girlfriend of the younger guy . Once again the zombies are seemingly indestructible , but this time a weakness is found in the form of electricity . So the conclusion to this one occurs at an electrical plant . The kid must face down the bully who released the chemical too . Would have been a better movie if it was more horror oriented , but it is still worth a look . The slimey zombie from the first one also makes a brief appearance .
549148	1111192	120157	6.0	Kurt Russell makes a fine science fiction soldier . . . to bad the story is a bit off beat .	Yes , say what you will about the bizarre plot and somewhat pointless setting of the movie on another planet , Kurt Russell did a rather good job as a soldier raised to complete missions and to follow orders to the max . His name , Todd , and you see how his life has been during a brief portion of the first part of the movie . It moves a bit to quickly after this to the old soldiers being replaced by artificially created soldiers who after a rather nice demonstration scene show they are superior as far as running and stuff goes so the military quickly ditches an apparently dead Todd and makes the rest of his outfit nothing more than regular Joe's . Well Todd is taken in a garbage spaceship to this planet of junk . Why they felt the need to have this movie take place on another planet is beyond me . Seems rather unnecessary as it could have easily taken place on an island that could have been turned into a landfill , but whatever , it does not really add or take anything away from the film . Suffice to say there are people on this planet and they take Todd in though they are wary of him . Finally , they decide to send him on his way as he is to dangerous for their tastes . Sadly Todd feels rejected a bit , but then comes his chance to show what he is made of as a military outfit consisting of the soldiers that replaced Todd are on the planet killing the people for a reason I can not remember at this time . Well finally we have some really good action scenes and a rather strange yet happy ending . The movie could have used a bit more of this and that . . . some more action , a few more alien lifeforms , and a better defined plot , but it is not all that bad and proves to be a nice distraction .
549088	1111192	78869	6.0	Better when I saw it as a kid .	I first saw this movie at the drive in when I was four years old . I really enjoyed it then , but I didn't understand what was going on . Now that I am older I know what is going on , but man there are sure a lot of visible strings . It also doesn't have the pop it did back then either . The story is rather interesting as it is a bit like that of the more recent " Event Horizon " . A ship that has been missing is found near a black hole . The doctor on the ship is preparing to enter the black hole as part of an experiment . There are a few stars that people know in this one , but no one really big . Anthony Perkins and Ernest Borgnaine are the biggest . Schell is also in it and so is Robert Forster who was in the movie " Alligator " . Perkins and Borgnaine aren't really in this one a whole lot though . There are a few fights and other things in this one , as it was probably made because of " Star Wars " . The effects though are definitely not the best as this film was probably rushed to be made . Not the best movie in the world , but I could think of worse ways to spend your time .
549012	1111192	104409	6.0	Hey Pinhead is finally the star .	After the first two movies being the most popular character and having very little screen time , finally Pinhead is the focus . Ironically , this one is rated lower than the first two , so maybe he was better off in the background . I actually like this one about the same as two and I liked two better than one . So I did like this part better than one also . I am guessing though , this one isn't liked as much because it really is more of your standard slasher rather than the twisted world of the first two so I can understand why people didn't like it as much . This one has Pinhead actually separated from the human he was . He is still part of this macabre statue seen at the end of part two and he is now owned by a very odd art dealer . This and that happens and before long Pinhead is unleashed on earth killing everyone in his sights and changing them into more weird beings like him . There is also this lady involved I think she was a reporter and she has a dream of the guy who Pinhead was . All in all I thought it was okay , but this is the last Hellraiser movie I watched and from what I see here there are quite a few more of them .
548355	1111192	121765	6.0	Not all that great . . . but ok .	First let me say that I am not a raving mad Star Wars fan who would enjoy anything as long as it had the name Star Wars pasted to it . This movie was not a really great spectacle to behold , but it is better than episode I . Neither of these two movies though can compare to the original triology . Some faults of the movie is the bad acting . I mean these actors are quite bad at times and at other they are no better than mediocre . Quite frankly , I never knew just how boring a jedi was . McGreggar is so dry as Obi Wan . I hope in the next movie they explain how he got to be a much more interesting old man . Samuel L . Jackson is in the wrong role , he would have been better used as a Han Solo type character than a dry jedi who plays second fiddle to Yoda who is the only decent jedi actor . Then there is Hayden . He is the worst actor in the flick . He constantly whines and complains about everything . I never pictured Darth Vadar being such a wimp . Portman does better though than the last flick so maybe Hayden will do better in the next flick . I think part of the problem is Lucas just doesn't like spending to much time directing the people as he does doing special effects . Jar Jar also returns , and he is in it a lot more than the commercials would have you believe . Then there was my favorite character in the movie who did the best job . . . Christopher Lee . Then again he could play this type of role in his sleep . There are good points to this flick besides Lee . The special effects give you something to look at when Anakin and Amidali are talking politics , there is a great battle at the end , and the saber fight between Lee and Yoda was great . All in all not to bad of a flick , but I suggest next time Lucas may want to get someone else to direct the actual actors and devote all his time to the stuff he does well .
548277	1111192	104352	6.0	One of the weakest for me in the hensei series of Godzilla movies .	It probably has something to do with the fact I have never been a big Mothra fan and hate it when they fight each other , because Mothra should not do as well as it always does . Lets face it , it is a giant moth and they should burn to a crisp when hit by fire . Still this one starts out promisingly enough with a nice little comical jungle adventure . Still when it is the scenes with the people that are the strongest and not the ones with Godzilla then you are probably in trouble . Godzilla is in this one a bit more than the previous movie , but this one just is kind of dull . To much singing for Mothra to come and such , and watching Mothra trample through the city is always boring cause Mothra just doesn't compare to other monsters doing the same . We also have another monster a tougher version of Mothra called Battra that wants to fight Mothra . Near the end they fight and Battra is beating Mothra and Godzilla literally saves Mothra so what does it do ? It joins forces with Battra to attack Godzilla . Godzilla is to much of a secondary monster here , with to much focus on the stupid moth . Still it has its entertaining moments such as Godzilla's first appearance and his resurrection on the volcano . More Godzilla less Mothra would have helped however .
548387	1111192	70948	6.0	A good movie . . . I think .	I am still not sure what this movie is about . I have seen it 3 or 4 times and still can't quite figure it out . Sure some of the scenes make perfect sense , and then there are those that make you say , huh ? If you watch this movie try seeing it uncut as the ending at least makes sense . I first watched it on the sci-fi channel and it just ended and I was left to wonder what the heck happened to Sean Connery's and the lady's characters . Suffice to say if you see it uncut it shows you and even if a bit depressing you at least find out . Though I am still not quite sure when Connery and the lady fell in love . This movie revolves around an outlaw I would call him coming into this dome world full of immortals . This immortals used Connery and others on the outside to do crops and stuff and to kill . They catch Connery and study him . . . meaning eventually kill him , but they never get round to it . There is a lot more to the plot , but it is hard to explain so I will leave it at that . Let's just say Connery's character disrupts these immortals way of life . The thing with the crystal and stuff will confuse you though . There is also a good deal of nudity in this one , but these ladies are a bit , um how would you say ? Flat chested so there really isn't anything to exciting there . All in all a sort of good movie . . . I think ?
548589	1111192	108517	6.0	A more gruesome movie than the first , but not as good .	Julian Sands returns here , but I don't know if he is supposed to be the same guy are not . The rules are all changed around here and in many ways it is almost an entirely different movie . The Warlock in this movie seems nearly indestructible than in the first , and instead of the puritan types that were the ones to try and stop him in the first one , here he must be stopped by druids . This time the Warlock makes a most memorable first appearance , and then he goes after these magic stones so he can release Satan into the world . This makes the druid angle seem rather dumb as I don't think they believe in such things . However , it still is a rather good movie , just not as good as the first . . . in fact this movie might have seemed better if the first one never happened . The movie though does follow a certain pattern . You see scenes of this kids coming into terms with their special powers to stop the Warlock , then a scene of the Warlock finding one of the stones , finally whoever has the stone is killed in an unusual way , and then repeat . This happens till the end and the big showdown occurs . I do so enjoy the shotgun scene . That is about all there is too it , but then the Warlock does kill people in vastly different and interesting ways . Not a great movie , but it is okay and worth checking out , though it is rather gruesome at times .
548863	1111192	86393	6.0	It has its moments .	I sort of like this film . . . definately better than 4 , it amazes me how many people say they actually think 4 is better . This movie is almost a pure comedy except for some scenes . Reeve is tolerable in this one . . . another thing I can't believe is how many people think Reeves was so great as Superman . I know a bunch of people who could have done better , just cause the man had a terrible accident doesn't mean you have to praise his acting ability ( other than Superman he has basically done nothing ) . Reeve does his best when he plays the dark superman . Richard Pyror steals the show though and is the main reason I like this one . Blessedly gone is Margot Kidder who only has a brief cameo . Like I said this one is more of a comedy and it isn't trying to take itself to seriously . . . to bad the same can't be said for 4 .
548255	1111192	91064	6.0	You will never see lemon-filled donuts the same way again .	Never saw the original , but I have to say this is one of the must yucky movies ever made . Not that it was bad , but the sole purpose of this movie seemingly was to gross people out . The story of a scientist's whose teleportation experiments have a slightly adverse effect on him is rather good . As for scares , there just are not that many , the movie is mostly watching a man deteriorate to the point of being really gross looking . Still it has a great cast , and it is a well done movie , just needed some kills or something else . He isn't super fly for very long , but for the most part just the melting man . Like I said , the main point of this film seemed to be just to gross you out . The eating scene with him showing how a fly eats is particularly icky as are the many scenes of various pieces of him coming off . Before the gross out begins though you are given an interesting enough plot about teleportation pods and there is another nasty scene involving a monkey , but in the end the most memorable scenes in the flick are the ones that make you go eww .
548801	1111192	103874	6.0	Needs more horror .	Yes this look at Dracula is definitely more romance than horror as there is really nothing that is all that scary in it . Not that it is entirely bad . . . in fact I would say I found it an ok movie , just needed more horror . The story is of course about Dracula . . . Keanu Reeves character goes to work for him after his previous employee Renfield went insane . Dracula sees a picture of Reeves fiancé ( Ryder ) and since she looks like someone he used to be in love with he goes after her leaving Reeves a prisoner in the castle . Dracula makes it to where Ryder is and attempts to win her over . Meanwhile , Reeves makes his escape . Hopkins playing Van Helsing comes involved , as Dracula has been sucking on Ryder's friend Lucy so she is a bit ill and Helsing is some expert . All in all not a bad film just needed a little more work in the horror department .
548737	1111192	95662	7.0	Granted it is a rather mild Pryor movie , still I found it funny .	Yes , this movie is not quite what one would expect from Richard Pryor . . . light on the cussing , a touch of being almost a family comedy , but not quite that tame . In this movie we have a man who is laid off and is offered a very nice job in Boise . Of course , his daughter is rather upset about the prospect of going there , however his wife and twin sons are a bit more supportive . Also happy to see the family go is the crazy neighbor played rather good my Randy Quaid . A neighbor who for some reason must cut his rather small lawn with an industrial mower . Well he has a couple of moving agencies give their appraisal of what it would take to move and he goes with the more expensive as the cheap ones look like recently escaped convicts or something . They find a nice house in Boise where they meet the delightful owners who tell great jokes about how they are going to take everything from the doors to the pool with them . Then he finds just the perfect guy to drive one of his vehicles to the new house . Well everything begins to unravel rather quickly as the movers turn out to be familiar faces he does not want to see , the jokes on them with the new house , and the driver of the car has a bit of a mental problem . So all in all a funny movie , a few of the jokes miss the marks such as the giving the wrong finger thing , however most are pretty good like how the twin sons run track . So for a rather light Richard Pryor comedy that still has some good laughs , give this movie a try .
548661	1111192	78087	7.0	I always enjoy a river horror .	I like horror movies that happen along or in rivers . Not that there are many " Shock Waves " and " Empire of the Ants " are the only two that come to mind right now . I do not know why , something about the scenery maybe ? This movie is of course about piranha released in a river by two people who should not have been messing around a facility . Of course , if they did what they were supposed to do then there would be no movie . This movie was obviously trying to capitalize on the success of " Jaws " , but for me it worked . The piranha are slowly making their way down the river and along the way they run into some kids at camp and this resort place . No one believes that they are coming , but that is the way it is in these movies . A sequel would come later and it would be directed by a then unknown James Cameron and it would be awful and a bit boring . Another piranha movie would be made by Roger Corman in the 90's , but it is essentially the same movie as this only not as good .
548463	1111192	65854	7.0	A rather good collection of tales .	This movie is another horror anthology . It is rather good , but it could have used a bit more . I compare it to " Doctor Terror's House of Horrors " , though in this one the title fits . It has four stories all somewhat connected by a house . The first tale is about a writer and his wife moving in . He creates a killer for his latest novel and then he starts seeing the killer roaming around in his house . This one is sort of predictable , but it does throw a few twists in the end . The next story is a bit more unpredictable , and you really do not know where the heck it is going . This one features Peter Cushing and was probably my favorite of the bunch . This guy buys the house , but it is not the house that takes center stage , but a rather strange wax museum . The third story starts out rather good and features Christopher Lee . This one has him as a rather bizarre dad who seems awfully protective of his daughter . The problem is that once you know what is going on the story does not end soon enough . It drags a bit leading to a very predictable conclusion . Then the final tale concerns an actor buying a cloak from an odd little shop . The actor really gets what he paid for . Then there is a small story about an officer who is seen throughout trying to find out what happened to this actor and then an explanation of why these things happened . Though I was not very satisfied with the explanation as I don't think it really explained Cushing's story much at all . I think they needed a bit more back story for that one . All in all though it was an interesting set of stories .
548690	1111192	87078	7.0	Pretty good sequel . . . though not as well made .	This sequel to Conan the Barbarian is a pretty good movie in its own right , though it is not of the same quality . The first one is definitely better , but this one is a more fun movie not to be taken as seriously . It also has more action than the first and this one needs it , as the acting isn't quite as good . Arnold is still good as Conan , but I didn't care for Wilt as the bad guy unless he was fighting . Grace Jones added nothing to the movie and does Conan really need this many people in his party ? His sidekick gets kind of annoying after awhile too . Fortunately , though there is plenty of action to take your mind of these qualities . . . though this one isn't nearly as bloody as the first one .
549060	1111192	55830	7.0	Rather good except in some ways it makes no sense .	I figured I knew the ending to this one before I watched it , but as I watched it I figured I might be wrong . In fact , I was not sure where the movie was going and that was one of its best aspects . Then in the end what I figured before I watched it comes to be , but it doesn't make much sense to me in some ways . This one has a girl who is the sole survivor of an awful car crash . She makes it through and ends up getting a job in some church in Utah . She goes there and strange things start to happen as she is stalked by this strange man , though is he really there at all or maybe he is a ghost . She also is seemingly drawn to this closed down carnival . Things go okay at first , but then she has episodes where people seem not to be able to hear or see her . She gets fired from the church and everything seems to lead back to the carnival , but then the ending comes and you are left wondering what the carnival really had to do with anything . Also why did the strange man and the others have such hostility to the girl ? She was not aware of what was going on . On the whole though , I found this movie to be rather entertaining . The scene where the people come out of the water and start chasing the girl are very well done and surprisingly chilling and effective . I just wish I could get what happened .
548705	1111192	55928	7.0	The first and definately not the best .	Not to say it is not a good movie , but I find this to be one of the weakest installments to the series . However , it is a rather good film that starts out great , but the ending isn't as good as the rest of the film . This film also has a villian that doesn't seem to have a very good plan . What I mean the viewer is not really sure what the heck Dr . No is trying to accomplish till near the end of the movie and then it is nothing really that special . As I have said it starts out great with a murder on some nice island I forget which , and Bond is sent to uncover the truth of this man's death . There are some chases and all that great spy stuff , and Bond first meets Felix . Then Bond goes to Dr . No's island where he meets the gorgeous Honey Ryder and they must avoid Dr . No's henchmen . Then with the appearance of the " dragon " the movie gets a bit weak for me after Bond and Honey are captured . The finale just isn't that great , but it isn't boring either . Not the best film , but still enjoyable .
549151	1111192	1104835	7.0	Not as good as the first one , still it had enough gore , violence and nudity to keep one entertained .	Yes , this movie is not quite up to par with the first one . My first complaint has to do with the way the characters were introduced . They replaced the whole words on the screen with a kind of video introduction that just is not as good as the " Animal House " type description of characters . The character's this time are not quite as appealing as the first either . I really liked the guy considered the jerk in the first movie and all the characters who had a large role were good . I really missed Rollins in this one , though I realize they could not really bring him back . Granted I did like that Clu was back as was Honey , and I rather liked the midget wrestler's too . Nobody else though was really all that special as the biker chick was a bit to serious for this movie . The story in this one is just a sort of a continuation of the first movie . Apparently , the monsters that attacked the bar were not alone as another group were attacking a small town at about the same time . We our introduced to some new characters and a biker chick who was the sister of the girl blown up in the first . She is out to get our hero from the last movie , last seen driving away in his car . The one gal is back in this film who left the people in the bar for dead too , granted it looks like the main reason she was brought back was so she could be tortured . So what can you expect from this movie . Lots of gore and kills that is to be sure . A monster autopsy that goes beyond the yuck factor , you just will shake your head at parts of that . A less than spectacular baby rescue . A rather stupid attempt at a catapult for flinging little people , though grandma gets to go first and lots of monsters tearing through the city and doing it with cats . Still , feels like a movie that is direct to video and has a cheapness about it the first movie did not . The ending to was a bit disappointing as it seemed right out of the very bad " Automaton Transfusion " .
548804	1111192	149261	7.0	A bit of a wimpy title for a killer shark movie .	This is a shark movie that is actually more Alien than it is Jaws . Don't get me wrong , it was a pretty good movie as long as you didn't take it to seriously , but I would have preferred more attacks in the open sea . What we get are most of the attacks happening in a research facility . Scientist are experimenting on sharks , looking for a cure to Alzheimer's , the sharks that are super intelligent strike back . The facility is basically floating , and the sharks bust a window and the facility starts to flood and then starts to sink and the sharks get in . Some good shark attacks follow . . . and you get to hear a very great speech by Samuel L . Jackson that is really inspiring . Of course , if you have seen the movie you know what I am talking about . In the end this isn't the type of movie you watch for the great acting , but for the wild action and shark attacks . In this one we get I think it was three sharks , two rather little ones and one big one . I loved Jaws so I had to go to this one , but it reminded me more of Alien they way they were in the facility , but you do get one shark attack on some teens in the open sea .
548986	1111192	444682	8.0	Well the movie that seemed as if it would never be released finally was . . .	and surprisingly I enjoyed it . Not the best movie ever , but I thought it was a very well paced horror movie a bit like " The Omen " with enough differences to keep it interesting . A woman who proves most miracles that occur usually have a scientific reasoning behind them is approached by a man who is having a problem in his town and wants her there to find out what is going on . Seems that the water has turned to blood in the nearby river , of course she is going to try to dispel that when other things of this nature occur such as dead frogs and livestock and a very powerful bout of lice . All signs seem to be pointing towards a little girl that lives on the outskirts of town a girl whose brother died of mysterious circumstances right before the river turned to blood . The movie was at its best to me when they were trying to find the reasons behind the strange occurrences , but it is still good when she just has to believe something is up . The ending was okay , if a bit to flashy for my tastes . Still , considering how many times this one was pushed backed it was surprisingly good . Most movies pushed back as much as this one are pushed back because they really suck .
548698	1111192	80057	8.0	A rather good zombie flick .	This movie that is simply named zombie , is a rather good movie . Unlike most zombie films this one actually establishes plot and stuff before the rampaging zombies even appear . A reporter and a gal looking for her father head to an island that is supposed to be cursed with a couple on vacation . Once on the island they learn of the terrible disease that apparently makes the dead come back to life . The doctor there seems shady and you wonder if he is responsible or is he really trying to find the cure as he claims . Before any answers can be found out the dead make their appearance and go on a eating spree . Along with this there is a cool underwater sequence , a woman who has to go into the water with no top , and gore galore . The end almost make it seem to be a prequel to " Dawn of the Dead " .
549004	1111192	89652	8.0	Part of the science comedy movie craze .	Movies come in phases now and then where a bunch of movies with similar themes come out at about the same time . There was the underwater craze of 89 ( " The Abyss " , " Leviathan " , and " Deepstar Six " ) and there was the body switch craze ( " Big " , " Vice Versa " , and one with Dudley Moore ) . This movie came out during the comedy with a science twist . The other two movies that came out during this phase are " Real Genius " and " Weird Science " . I liked this phase as I enjoyed all three movies quite a bit . This one was no exception as it combined humor and science fiction very well . This one has a couple of kids finding this strange device that I think ended up being some type of engine . Anyway when this thing gets hooked up with power and turns on all sorts of strange stuff starts happening . The thing seems to be able to move time or open portals . The end is great as the thing really goes berserk and it turns the school ( I think it was the school ) into a battle zone complete with different times . There is a dinosaur and mutants . All in all I am probably in the minority in liking this one , but I thought it was really good .
548809	1111192	89822	8.0	I actually thought this one was the best of the police academy movies .	Yes , from the score here I can see most people do not share my opinion , but I can roll with it . I just found this one funnier than the first one , not by much mind you and a rather good sequel to the first film as well . Though this movie would start the disturbing trend of the studio making a sequel for this franchise every year for like seven straight years which is way to much for any type of movies . I say as a general rule a sequel should come out at least two years after the original with three being the optimum . One is to few , four it starts to become to many . Still , the opening of this film having a guy locking up his store had me laughing as a kid and for the most part the jokes were a hit . Granted in the future installments the jokes would become stale , here they were still rather fresh and a few new ones were added in too . I loved it when Tackleberry met his partners family and such . Bob Cat is in this movie too , and as much as I can not stand him I thought he did a good job here . They replaced G . W . Bailey here and I thought the guy who played Mauser or whatever was actually an improvement as they sort of play the same type character . I also liked them getting their partners and I enjoyed seeing them doing more police work on the streets rather than the academy stuff . So while most others would disagree I thought this was the funniest of the Police Academy movies and the last good one period .
549024	1111192	279840	8.0	Not quite as good as the first Grandia , but it grew on me .	I was not wild about this Grandia when I first played it . I thought it was okay , but nothing really special . However , I have enjoyed it more upon subsequent playings mainly because now I just deal with the fact it is not a direct sequel to the original . I know , most rpg sequels are not , but I was so sure this one would be as the title refers to the same place and all . The fighting is really the only similarity between the two games and the walking the maps and such . The story is completely new . It has a young man who takes odd jobs here and there , and his new job is to escort this priestess to this temple to perform a ceremony . Well it is not that simple as this demon female appears after the ceremony goes bad and this is the start of the quest . Ryudo ( the hero ) is trying to escort the priestess to a holy city as she contains a very strange secret , meanwhile the demon female appears from time to time wanting Ryudo to help her collect strange pieces of a long dead dark god . Like I said not the original , it is still a lot of fun , but be prepared to fight quite a lot . Still , as long as you kill all enemies in your path , fighting in the later levels should be still relatively easy . And this one has one advantage over the original in that the ending is much better to me .
548823	1111192	449088	8.0	Jack Sparrow returns , though not nearly enough for my tastes .	On par with Dead Man's Chest , not as good as the first part three still offers a very wild ride . The main problem , I have never had a harder time trying to keep up with so many double crosses and under the table deals as I did in this movie . Everyone had a hidden motive it seemed even Will Turner who in the last movie was just a trusting dupe . I can not believe no one seems to have the problems with this story as they did with Spidey 3 which I found very easy to follow . Add to that the fact that Captain Jack Sparrow , the sole character who made this series is not in it much and you have the disappointment of part two all over again . Granted it was not a huge disappointment , it was a good movie and it was great seeing Geoffrey Rusch back as Barbossa so it did get points for that . The story , this is going to be the hard part , however , I am keeping it as simple as possible . The gang is going in search for Jack , all with differing reasons . Jack is banished to Davey Jones locker and is going a bit crazy . There is a rescue and now there is a pirate meeting to attend , something about a song , a vengeful sea spirit named Calypso and various other obstacles leading to what I have to say is one heck of an action packed conclusion that is packed with great special effects . So there you have it , sure it could use a trimming of the run time as it goes on a while , but it still manages to entertain . I would have liked to see a simpler story though with a bit more comedy as there are some chuckle scenes , just nothing all that super funny like in the first . It was also surprising to see the villain from the last movie Davey Jones play basically a very small role till the very end during the uber action scene . Characters seemingly not all that important in the last film are now somewhat the focal point and you see Keith Richards in a small role as well . So as you can see there is a bit much going on and if there were a sequel to be made I say no Will or Elizabeth , bring back Barbossa , and have Jack Sparrow in it more and keep the plot more lighthearted and simple .
548424	1111192	397040	8.0	Not beyond good , but good nonetheless .	The critics loved this game and so I thought I would buy it . In the end it was a rather good and original game . The only two problems I have with it is the fact it is too short and the ending is a bit lacking . The rest of the game is rather fun though and rather easy to pick up and varies as well . You control Jade , a gal who watches over these orphans at a lighthouse . Why are they orphans , well an alien race has come to this particular planet full of all sorts of weird aliens and is causing havoc by abducting its citizens and such . A military group is on the planet to protect it , but they seem to have issues as well . Well you must guide Jade through this planet searching for the truth and you even become a sort of photographer for a group committed to exposing the truth . So this for me was the best portion of the game as you must sneak in these facilities and take pictures . You are also awarded for taking pictures of the various alien life forms on the planet . You do some fighting , and it is rather easy to perform , but stealth also plays a key role in the game . You will also use a hovercraft to reach areas and win races and a spaceship late in the game . So there a various things to do . Still though it wraps up way to soon , and the ending doesn't really overwhelm . Still though , it is different from all the sequels and such that come massive waves .
548343	1111192	435625	8.0	Prepare to descend into the very depths of fear .	I enjoyed this movie about six gals mainly from England going caving . The movie was fast paced once they got to the caves and did not let up until the finish . The story has a woman who the previous year lost both a husband and daughter to a very gruesome car accident . She was apparently an extreme sports junkie , but for the past year has been in mourning for the loss of her loved ones . Now , however , she reunites with some old friends and they are going caving , girls only . They are supposed to go to a rather simple cave to explore with no real danger or thrills , however one of the members of the group has decided instead to take them to a cave she discovered . . . and what the girls discover there is sheer terror . This movie was very effective , even before there are any kind of creatures introduced the movie was tense . There is a great scene involving being stuck in a tight place , a really dangers climbing the wall scene and a scene involving a broken leg . I mean the poor girls have virtually no shot at survival at this point then if all this is not bad enough there is something lurking in the caves and it likes to feast on flesh . So there ya go , finally a horror movie that does seemingly indeed put our cast in a virtually inescapable situation with no apparent way out . It is not all good though , I did not care for some of the character's behavior towards the end as I would hope one would rather lean on someone for support . Instead there is a rather shocking scene that to me seems petty . Wait and try to get out then settle differences . Still this horror movie was really good and tense .
548543	1111192	76704	8.0	Terror in the Water .	This is not a gruesome gory zombie movie , but it is a very good horror movie all the same . The plot is about some vacationers out on a boat just cruising when the boat breaks down . They go to a near by island while out in the ocean dead nazi zombies rise with the sole intention of killing those that get in their way . These zombies are not after flesh , blood , or brains they just kill you cold heartily . Peter Cushing plays a hermit with a secret and John Carradine plays a captain , both are in the movie far to short a time , however . Other than that it is a highly entertaining flick that is more like a 50's or 60's horror though a bit more graphic . Just goes to show not all good horror films have to have an " R " rating to be good .
548423	1111192	320691	8.0	Gothic tale of the war between vampires and werewolves .	Rather good and sleek action / horror hybrid in the same vein as a Blade , though not quite up to that movie . The action is good , and the scenery is good to as the city setting seems very other worldly , a Gothic mixture of old and new . The story , there has been an ages old feud between werewolves and vampires , the vampires apparently winning as they are slowly but surely wiping the wolves out . However , there seems to be a new target of the wolves , a young doctor whose blood the wolves want for reasons that are not immediately clear . So there ya have it , throw in a lot of gun fire and some latex and you have your movie . There are problems with the film though as there are a lot of double crosses and I am still not one hundred percent clear as to what made the doctor dude so important . Still , there is plenty of action to watch and lots of blood too . It was funny seeing how the werewolves were a bit rough and the vampires looked like aristocrats . It was a bit hard to pull for either side until the end when all the motivations were on the table too , as neither side seemed really to be making a target of humans . So all in all a good action / horror flick .
549145	1111192	71807	8.0	Good , but only because of Moore and Lee .	This Bond plot is probably one of the weakest , but thankfully Roger Moore and Christopher Lee turn in great performances that turn what would probably a rather average film into a pretty good one . An assasine has been seemingly sent to kill Bond , this part of the plot is good , but then there is this energy crisis plot involving this really good solar cell and other things that make this Bond of the weaker ones plot wise . Lee does a great job as the title character , but another problem with this movie is that throughout you are anticipating the showdown between Bond and the man with the golden gun and when it finally happens it is a bit of a let down . Also , the guy who played the sheriff in " Live and Let Die " is back and he is quite annoying . I still enjoy this movie though .
548789	1111192	107144	8.0	I thought it was funnier than one , but then I have seen the Rambo movies .	Yes , I thought this one was funnier mainly because I have seen more of the movies this one has spoofed . I loved that Richard Crenna was in this one and I loved the fight scene spoofing the one seen in Rambo III . Charlie Sheen is back and still super funny , as is Lloyd Bridges who always makes a good choice for a spoof movie . The movie of choice here is the Rambo saga , mainly part two and three . You have a plot of a missing group of soldiers and they keep sending more in to seemingly get captured . Finally , Topper Harley is on the case going in with his own platoon to free the numerous hostages . So we get our various scenes making fun of the Rambo movies as these are the best . The ones before he sets off on his quest are not quite as good . I liked his first encounter with an old friend , the boat scene , and numerous others . The best for me was the scene when the kill counter was up and it became the bloodiest movie of all time ! ! ! It also has a great scene between Lloyd's character and a Sadaam look a like . So in the end if you have not seen the Rambo movies and a few other movies it will not be quite as funny as it was for me who had seen the majority of movies this one spoofs .
548346	1111192	259324	8.0	A super high concept movie that will move you to tears and change your life , no . . . still a fun ride all the same .	Yes this movie was probably in the end a pure popcorn flick that many will hate , however I thought it was a good fun movie . Rather nice treatment for a comic book hero that isn't exactly super well known or famous . Ghost Rider blazes on the big screen and the effects are rather good considering the character of Ghost Rider is essentially a skeleton in leather riding a motorcycle and he is on fire . The story seems to combine the two Ghost Riders I am familiar with from the marvel universe . . . the first one was Johnny Blaze who sold his soul to the devil . The second one being more a spirit of vengeance who used his stare to show evildoers the wrongs they have committed . I thought Cage was rather good in his role as were the other actors . . . I mean this is a comic book movie not an Oscar caliber movie we are talking about here . So all in all it is fun , could have used maybe a little more Ghost Rider here and there and perhaps a trim or two here or there to cut the running time , for the most part there are very few complaints by me . Ghost Rider is a comic I collected at one time , so it is kind of cool to see him on the big screen . However , don't go by my review alone in determining whether you will see this flick , as I love comic book adapted movies to a fault . . . that and horror so I may like stuff other more casual fans may not .
548214	1111192	84684	8.0	Kind of a Chuck Norris versus an unstoppable killer movie .	I liked this one quite a bit . The premise has Chuck going against a psycho . Kind of like a Jason or Michael Myers , but here it is explained why the killer can keep getting up after he is seemingly stopped . The problem is some doctors have been using an experimental drug that basically gives the killer the same healing powers as the X-men's Wolverine . All in all , this one moves pretty well , except for some scenes here and there that could have been cut out . I don't know if the biker gang was necessary , but it was sort of fun watching it . I could have used a few more scenes of the killer going after victims , as they are the best scenes . This one is a lot better than " The Hero and the Terror " as it sort of had the same thing , but this one I find a lot better . That one is kind of boring and the final fight isn't very good . Here though you get right into the action as you see the killer at home . He basically starts losing his mind here as kids are screaming and some lady keeps yelling at the top of her lungs . The guy gets a phone call from his doctor and basically tells the doc he is about to go over the edge . He then proceeds to get an axe , and you can see what this leads too . The movie could have explained some parts better and I wasn't fond of the ending as it should have been painfully obvious that what Norris did wouldn't be good enough .
548199	1111192	80907	8.0	Simple but good .	This , of course , was McQueen's last role . It is nothing grand , and for the most part there really is no plot , but it is still a rather good movie . This movie revolves around McQueen's character who is a bounty hunter . This movie shows him go after various people and also shows his home life . . . which is a bit unique too . He goes after super big rednecks , small time crooks , crazy guys who blow things up , and one rather dangerous individual . Someone who he captured in the past also stalks him . All in all it isn't the greatest movie , but it mixes action and humor well . Even though McQueen was feeling the effects of his illness during the shooting of this one , he still does a great job .
548282	1111192	70917	8.0	Not much of a horror , but good .	This movie has been recommended to me by several people so I bought it . It turned out to be a pretty decent movie , but I wouldn't call it a horror flick . Great cast and acting make this mystery go which it is more of a mystery type flick . Of course at one point I was worried it was going to be some sort of musical , but after a stint where there are quite a few songs in a row they taper off . Of course the one song with Britt Ekland was rather good . . . heh heh . Christopher Lee is great in this one as well . It basically follows a cop from england trying to find a missing girl on an island full of pagans . In the end I really felt sorry for the one character .
548957	1111192	94995	8.0	Fast paced anime action at its best .	This is one of my favorite anime movies I have seen . It is very fast paced with really cool action scenes , likable characters dubbed good , and good villains as well . Only one dude can save the world from the demons . . . his father tried to previously , but failed . This is shown right at the beginning and sets the tone for the rest of this flick . Let's just say that there aren't many boring parts to speak of . My favorite character had to be Mephisto . You wonder if he is on the side of good , or perhaps evil . Through it all the dude fights his way through the demons till he has the final confrontation with the man responsible for his dad's death . The final conflict is one for the ages and the ending to this one won't leave you saying " what just happened ? " .
549018	1111192	207701	8.0	Nice bloody horror survival game .	The first one had a lot of flaws , but the sequels worked out most of them quite nicely . Here , you don't have to worry so much about running out of ammo or health . The story is also good too , as you are thrown right in the middle of a zombie shoot out during an excellent movie sequence that is a vast improvement over the lame opening in the first movie . You are Jill Valentine , and you must escape the zombie filled city and yes , this game would have been better titled Biohazard as quite a lot of the action takes place out in the streets . I do not know why they needed to call this series Resident Evil . Well you must go to various places , do some puzzles and things of this like . Sounds like part two and in a way they share some similarities . However , it differs in one regard in that there is a titan like monster on your tail and this ramps up the tension level when it starts chasing you all over the place . So you basically move from place to place being stalked by this beast along with all the other familiar foes of the Resident Evil genre . Jill can collect a wide range of weapons , and once you have won the game you can play a cool survival mini game so all in all this game is a must for those who like the horror survival type games .
549036	1111192	480249	9.0	Good movie , but man I was depressed afterwords .	Yes , this movie has a bit of " the Omega Man " and " The last man on Earth " in it , but for the most part it is its own movie . It starts out with the world in ruins , well New York in ruins and you are introduced to Robert Neville who may be the last man on earth . You are also introduced to Sam his faithful German Shepard , which struck a chord with me as I used to own one of those myself and love that particular breed . You get to see how he spends a typical day in his life and you also are introduced to those things that lurk in the darkness and only come out at night . However , at this stage those that come out at night seem to be targeting our hero . So we have some good chase scenes , and some good action , but you also have a couple of scenes that are really depressing especially if you like dogs . Our hero is not alone for the entire picture , however , as he comes across a lady and her son , well they kind of come across him . There are also flashbacks detailing the beginning of the end of civilization . The creatures are different than those in Omega Man and Last Man too as they are more like that infected from 28 days later though they do share the pale traits of the omega ones . All in all a good movie that left me depressed .
548800	1111192	97576	9.0	Very good third installment	This one was a lot better to me than the Temple of Doom . What made this one fun to watch was great action and great interplay between Connery and Harrison Ford . Sean Connery really added a spark to this one and provided the film with some of its more humorous elements ( Still like Raiders best though ) . This one has Indiana looking for the Holy Grail . . . the villains , once again it is the Nazis . This one starts out with kind of an earlier Jones adventure with the late River Phoenix as the young Indiana Jones taking an artifact from this tomb raiders cause as Indy says , " it belongs in a museum " . Then the story flash forwards to him trying to recover the same artifact . Then he goes after the Holy Grail because his father has disappeared while looking for it . This leads Indy to Venice then to a castle in , I think , Austria where he finds his dad a prisoner of the Nazis . After they get away they have to go into the heart of Germany to retrieve a book that will help them get through traps that protect the Holy Grail . They take a zephyr and there is a cool bi-plane fight and then it is off to a Middle Eastern country to find the grail . The trap scenes are cool and there is a great tank scene before the traps . Then comes the only complaint I have and that is the chamber with the Holy Grail . . . the guy guarding it was a bit lame . Other than that though , this was a really great movie .
548452	1111192	93409	9.0	The start of it all .	This was the first teaming of Mel Gibson and Danny Glover and still one of the best . I liked part two a bit more . This one though has it all : action , drama , comedy ( though I don't think comedy should be the first one listed like it is on imdb ) . The story . . . a hooker takes a plunge off a building and Glover is assigned to the case . He is also assigned a new partner Riggs ( Mel Gibson ) , who is a suicidal cop who gets quite berserk at times . The investigation leads to an old Special Forces unit dealing in drugs . Along the way Riggs helps a potential suicide jumper , Murtaugh ( Glover ) invites Riggs to dinner , and the Special Forces unit kidnap Murtaugh's daughter . Great action ensues here as it leads to one heck of a fight on a front lawn .
548734	1111192	483781	9.0	My favorite Prince of Persia game . . . has the best flow .	Yes , this game is the final installment for this particular prince of Persia , a new one is waiting in the wings . However , as far as this prince is concerned this is the best game he is in . The reason , it does the best job incorporating the fighting and the acrobatics the best of the three . Basically , the fighting is fun and you have plenty of the wall running to really keep you entertained . Throw into that more boss fights than the previous two installments could muster and a nice little change in the prince as he becomes a dark self . It even has the addition of stealth kills that are easy to do and look very cool . The game is a bit short though , and the way it picked up with the sorceress of time alive as she died on the only play through I did in Warrior Within . Which means you should not make your game multiple ending and pick up only one of the possible endings in the next installment . So here we have an old villain emerge , an old ally emerge and a very dark side of the prince emerge . The dark prince side is rather cool and can slice and dice opponents very effectively . His main drawback is that water is a weakness of his and he slowly but surely runs out of health . Still he can replenish it by killing enemies and he does that quite well . The regular prince is still effective to at what he does and fighting and stealth kills are his thing too . You do not go over the same territory in this one like in Within so the game remains fresh . There is a chariot race like scene in this one , but not that great . It is okay , but it does not really add anything . So for my money all in all this is the best of the three prince of Persia games .
548733	1111192	85995	9.0	A rather good vacation for you the viewer , not so much for the Griswalds .	Yes , the classic road trip movie and one of the best as far as comedy road trip movies . This is the first of four vacation type movies and is easily the best , granted I never saw the one in Vegas . This one just seems the most realistic , granted I am doubting all the things that happened here could happen on one trip , but still I am sure these things have happened before on family trips . So the story in this one ? Simple , the Griswalds are going on a cross country trip to Wally World and plan on taking in the sights of America along the way . What could be more fun ? They even stop at some relatives house and get to take on another traveler in the form of a delightful aunt . Yes , this movie is very funny and you just have to cringe at all the stuff that goes wrong on Clark's ( Chevy Chase ) perfectly planned trip as things go wrong right from the get go as the vehicle they planned on driving gets replaced by a rather crappy station wagon . The cast is great as Chevy is in prime form and Beverly DeAngelo is perfectly cast as his wife . The kids in this one are the best of the movies I have seen in the vacation series and Randy Quaid is excellent as cousin Eddie . We all have that relative hiding in the wings don't we ? The trip seems to go from one disaster to the next , and while it is terrible what they have to go through it is still worth a lot of laughs . Many people I am sure have driven into the bad part of town on accident , driven through that detour sign , and had run ins with the local law enforcement . Granted , I am also sure not many have found themselves in the middle of a desert , flirting with a beautiful modelesque lady , and had to use a BB gun to get into a park . So for a very funny and memorable trip check out this vacation .
548728	1111192	85334	9.0	Just your average family Xmas from the 1940's or 1950's .	I really enjoyed first seeing this movie as a kid with my dad . We just happened to stumble upon it one day . Upon subsequent viewings , I still enjoyed this classic . Now they overplay it a bit , I still like to catch bits and pieces of it during the holiday season as you really do not have to see the movie from start to finish to enjoy it . In fact , I could probably not tell you the movie from start to end in correct order . I know the beginning and end , however , the middle is scrambled . The story is simple enough to summon up , a boy is experiencing a typical Christmas season , this year the boy really wants to get a BB gun for Christmas . His mother is firmly against this , the movie is basically the boy going through the typical stuff during the holiday season and doing things to try desperately to get a red Ryder BB gun . He gets to fight the local bully , write an essay on what he would like for Xmas and even tries to tell Santa himself what he most desires . His family consists of an eccentric mom and dad and a little brother who has to dress in many layers of clothes for school . The movie is funny and charming and is rather simple . It features many likable characters and cute situations . It also does not get to sentimental for a holiday movie , most of them have some sort of message or overly sentimental parts . This one stays light hearted and funny throughout .
549052	1111192	791188	9.0	Loved the fight involving Garaa !	I liked this movie , the second Naruto feature film . I enjoyed the one in the snow a tad better though as I found the story here a bit disjointed as I was not sure where certain things were supposed to be happening or when . Still , like the first film this one too has a nice run time to it of a hour and a half , plenty of time for a nice well developed movie with some really cool fights . The story starts off with ninja from the village hidden in the sand in combat with unknown assailants . It then shits to Naruto , Sakura , and Shikumaru hunting down a ferret for what they think is going to be an easy assignment . They soon find out otherwise as they are also attacked and Naruto is separated from his friends after he has a fight with a strange young warrior clad in armor . They both are injured and taken in by a caravan and soon after Naruto is invited to join this strange organization that wishes to create a utopia . Of course , all is not as it seems and there are plenty of fights to go around . My favorite was the one involving Garaa fighting this strange woman who takes him very lightly which is a very big mistake . The concluding fight is rather good too involving Naruto and this strange man who is a better villain than any of those in the previous movie .
548442	1111192	432021	9.0	Mad Max with zombies . . .	Yes , this movie to me was very good and action packed . However , I am not a movie critic just an average guy that likes to see loads of head shot action . If I were a movie critic I would probably say it was not very good . I was impressed that they picked up from the last one , as they did not seem to forget plot points I thought they might have from part two . The only thing missing were the little girl survivor from the last movie along with the Jill Valentine character ( which made me a bit sad ) . Still , one could just figure they died along the way so their absence by no means hindered the plot . So what is the plot , the world is overrun by the undead , infected by Umbrella's t-virus . Umbrella still exists , still experimenting for the good of themselves . Survivor's roam the lands , some by themselves . . . Alice for example , some as tightly knit roving communities on wheels that include a couple of familiar faces from part two , and then there are rednecks , who are idiots that deserve what Alice does to em . Alice meets up with her old friend and the caravan and plot a course towards possible salvation , meanwhile an Umbrella scientist once again locks in on her and needs a blood sample . Yes , this movie has loads of zombies and other nasty creatures and it has lots and lots of action . From an undead crow attack , to a Las Vegas zombie attack to a final showdown in one of Umbrella's hive facilities . This movie was very good and if this is the last one it ends on a good note in my opinion .
548642	1111192	426459	9.0	A feast for gore fans .	Yes , this movie is rather gory , and it has a rather dark sense of humor , but it is also rather good . I enjoyed this movie which while nothing new in respects to the old locked in the house surrounded by killers routine it manages to do a few new tricks here and there to surprise you . Basically like " Night of the Living Dead " , " Dog Soldiers " , and " From Dusk till Dawn " this movie has a group of people at their local bar just passing the night away as per the usual . Of course , it wouldn't be much of a movie if that was all there was to it . . . no just when we get acquainted with the characters in comes a character bloody and with a gun shouting warnings of an impending attack by monsters . Well the monsters do attack and there is lots of death and blood and people are eaten . The monsters do more than that too , but I will not go into any more detail than that . So who will live and who will die and who will be shot by panicking people are some of the many questions to be answered . Don't expect any information on the monsters , however , as they are just here to kill and have no origins in this movie . Which of course could result in a sequel , but then perhaps they will leave well enough alone and take this movie as is with nothing more to say .
548336	1111192	121766	9.0	Lucas pulls the last bit of magic he has out of the hat to make a very good end to an otherwise mediocre trilogy .	Finally , a Star Wars movie that lives up to the original trilogy has been made . However , as with the Matrix three where I say you can just about skip the last two I say you can skip the first two of this one and enjoy it for what it is , the turning of Anakin to the dark side of the force . Lucas provides enough back story that you really need not see Phantom Menace or Attack of the Clones to enjoy this one . Not that this movie is perfect , Anakin's and his love's scenes are still a bit awkward , however the scenes with him and the future emperor are very good . And of course the action scenes and special effects are done to perfection . Particularly the action scenes here . Could have used a bit more of Christopher Lee's character , however even in the short time he is on screen he still makes his presence felt . This movie though is all about Anakin's final turn toward the dark side , the forces that finally drive him to the deadly destiny that would make him feared throughout the galaxy . The highlight of this one comes at the end as two breathtaking duels take place and evil begins to take a strong place and an empire is born . And thankfully , Jar Jar is a virtual no show with only a brief appearance and no speaking lines . . . though I do wish he was killed still . One thought I have though about Lucas that has come about is that considering I think Empire Strikes Back the best of the original series and this one of the newer one , he seems to make the best movie when bad triumphs over good .
548738	1111192	364126	9.0	The start of an epic story . . .	Yes this is my type of role-playing game , more story less action , less fighting to level up and so forth . If that is not your kind of game , then I would suggest you skip this series , however , I thought it was great . . . though not as good as Xenogears , the game this may or may not be a prequel to . The only reason I say may or may not is that it ends suddenly in part three and it does not all add up to what Xenogears picks up . This game basically stars a cute gal named Shion , get to know her well as she is the focus of this series . During this part of the story you are mainly introduced to the characters and the villains . You get your intrigue and you get your Gnosis , strange creatures seemingly unbeatable at first . The fighting is turned based and fairly fun , however , the inclusion of robots in this particular games seems rather underdeveloped . For the most part they are rather pointless . Still you get your good story and the ending is good too , though almost nothing big gets done and no real surprises in the first edition . All in all though a good game where the only real flaw is the lack of variety in the music during fights and such .
548493	1111192	800080	9.0	Smashingly good fun .	Better in every way to the 2003 film , this movie is another in a line of films that will set up the Avengers movie on the big screen . Iron Man was a better film on the whole , however , I thought this one had by far the better final showdown fight . The story has Bruce Banner on the run from General Ross and the army as they want the incredible power that resides in Banner . They wish to create their own super soldiers . There is a great chase scene in I think Rio and of course the transformation and the first meeting of the Hulk and a soldier named Emil Blonsky . Bruce goes on the run again and makes his way to the university where Betty Ross works in order to find data on the gamma experiment to send information to a scientist that Bruce has been communicating with in hopes of a cure . Meanwhile , Blonsky is given a super soldier serum and the next encounter with the Hulk ends up with him being nearly killed . Finally , Blonsky gains the ultimate power and it is up to Bruce and his mean green alter ego to save the day . The action in this one is great , the Hulk looks rather good as does the Abomination and their fight is one of the better ones in a comic book based movie , especially between two super strong characters . The only complaints I have is that the feel of the movie is just not right . It feels like you jump in the middle of a story that needed a bit more background . I just do not know how to say it , unlike Iron Man , something feels off . So good movie yes , but Iron Man is still the top avenger so far .
548985	1111192	1077258	9.0	A really fun zombie movie with lots of gore . . . no I mean lots of GORE ! ! !	This movie was just great , one of the better zombie spoofs out there , and yes it is more a spoof than a serious movie . I laughed quite a few times at this one . Story , what story who cares ? Well there sort of is one . Seems a chemical has been released and it is of course causing people to be zombies . We have a rather good cast of characters which includes a very fine looking Rose McGowan . The zombie outbreak takes a bit to get going , but when it finally does there is buckets of blood as it just spews out everywhere to a very insane extent . We have our hero who is great with guns , I mean they prove it by him spinning them around . Well actually it did not look all that impressive , but the characters in the movie were just looking at him in awe . Then there is the mother of a child whose doctor husband is a tad crazy . She loves her child , but I question her one decision . Then there is the great revelation of our hero , to bad the reel was missing at that point . And anyone who thinks what occurred during the missing reel scene was actually shot , has no sense of humor . So we have some Texas barbecue , some zombies , and a hot chick with a gun leg doing stripper moves ( pardon me go go dancer moves ) while she blasts away the zombies . Yes , this movie had it all . Though surprisingly it had a couple of slow bits to , not that it deters from the movie a lot , but they were noticeable .
548484	1111192	376994	9.0	Good movie . . . but if it is the " Last Stand " it should have been more .	I enjoyed this movie better than the first one , but it lacked what the second movie had . Still many good things were to be found in this movie as I really enjoyed the fact Magneto really showed how powerful he was with some really jaw dropping deeds in magnetism . Beast was finally a main player and played really well by Kelsey Grammar . Great ending fight scene between our hero's and Magneto's virtual army and the Juggarnaut was just great . Still it had some flaws too , if this is supposed to be the final movie I didn't care for the fate of one of my favorite X-men from the comics ( though admittedly not everyone else's favorite ) though reading through some blogs I understand why now ( I think I would rather have him recast instead ) . The plot needed more development as the Dark Phoenix plot mixed with the cure plot needed more than just an hour and forty five minutes coverage . They could have easily added at least thirty to forty minutes of movie . Then there are the characters that were not very distinct . . . other than Pyro and Juggernaut I didn't really recognize anyone in Magneto's army and I hear Pyslocke was one of em . And why oh why didn't two of the characters that you would expect to trade punches never did ( you know who I am talking about ) . All in all it was a great thrill ride with wonderful special effects . Ian and Patrick Stewart once again steal their scenes , but nearly everyone did a good job . If this was the last one ( and I hope it isn't ) it was a rather nice end , however , if they choose to make more I will be on board and quite frankly the way the left it they need more .
548948	1111192	82971	10.0	My favorite movie of all time !	There are few movies I can watch over and over again , but this is one of them . This movie has it all : action , romance , comedy , and suspense . Harrison Ford is at his best as Dr . Jones , one of the most exciting archeologist ever . From the start to the end you are hooked to this movie . I love the opening when he as to dodge traps as he tries to get this treasure , I love it when he is running through the streets trying to save the girl , I just love every bit of it . Spielburg said he wanted a b-type movie like he remembered from his youth , but this far surpasses any b movie and any a movie as far as I am concerned .
548540	1111192	96895	10.0	Simply the best	In fact it is no real contest . Before Tim Burton went for the totally dark look and Joel went for bright and goofy there is the original Batman . This one Burton did right . . . just enough gloom , comedy , and other factors to make is an enjoyable flick . It helps to have Nicholson play the Joker . He was by far the best villan in the series . Michael Keaton did a good job as well . It also helped that when Batman appeared it was something special . The museum scene where he came through the skylight still has not been duplicated sucessfully . It also focused on the villan more and Bruce Wayne instead of being just focused on Batman . The story was good as well . Like I said it is dark , but not to dark and it never got real goofy .
548740	1111192	425112	10.0	Even better than Shaun of the Dead , this movie delivers the laughs and surprisingly the action .	The best comedy I have seen this year or probably the last couple of years this movie had me laughing and cheering on our heroes . In this movie we have a super cop who has gotten numerous awards for his excellent service , top of his class , and smart too . Unfortunately , he is to good in that he makes the other officers in London look bad so he is promoted to Sergent in a very small and quaint little town . Once there he quickly makes his presence known and we get to see him adjust to his new life and even a new partner . Well not really a new partner as he is more of a guy who really looks up to the officer for all he has done . However , all is not as it seems in this nice little town as something sinister seems to be at play . This movie is just great . Funny , and it has loads of action and blood too . It is sort of nice to see a rated R action cop movie again . Throw in a plot that actually surprised me a bit and it a nice change of pace from the the computer terrorist plots so many movies are employing and you have one of the great films of the year . Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are great here as they were in Shaun of the Dead , they are also likable as it is like joining a couple of friends at a day on the job . Also in the cast is a former James Bond , Timothy Dalton so that was interesting as well . Still even with the cool action scenes what I was looking for here was laughs and I got plenty , from the opening scenes to the final ones the jokes flew fast and furious with a few sentimental touches as well , however , they added to the movie and worked quite nicely too . So for a super funny cop buddy flick this should be on your list of one of the best .
