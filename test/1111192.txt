548997	1111192	70435	1.0	A name for Yawn !	From what I read in the tv guide it sounded like it might be a rather interesting haunted house movie . Instead it is perhaps one of the most boring movies ever filmed . The plot is muddled and really makes no sense , it is very slow paced , and there are very few instances of supernatural going ons . Instead the most we see is a shadow moving here and there and a stupid horse . This makes " The Amityville Horror " look like an Italian horror film splatter fest . The plot , couple moves into an old house that belonged to the guy's great grandfather . You figure out the rest . Apparently , the ghost is haunting the place , but nothing much happens . Even the end makes very little sense . Why this movie was entitled " A Name For Evil " is beyond me . Well that was the name of the book , but I hope the book had more going on than happened here . I have to say avoid this movie at all cost . It is almost to painful to sit through , you will feel like taking a nap in the middle of it and by golly you will not miss a thing . I can not believe this movie was on amc , because it is not an american classic .
548858	1111192	116250	1.0	How did I get dragged to this movie ?	First off , let me say I hate musicals and don't blame me for hating this one as well . I somehow got talked into seeing this one by a friend so if you don't like what I have to say blame him and his ex girlfriend . I just thought this was one of the most boring flicks ever , the songs stunk and the story did as well too . It of course focuses on Eva Peron who the movie makes out to be a saint , I won't go into it since there may be those who are offended by the truth , let's just say she wasn't . Banderos character was sort of the narrator , and he does a lousy job at it as I found myself wondering what the heck was happening . Let's just say I wasn't crying for her at the end as I would have walked out of the theater an hour and a half earlier if my friends weren't my ride . Though it taught me a lesson , don't go to a film you don't want to go to cause you won't enjoy yourself .
548911	1111192	55294	1.0	The phantom planet looks like it is extra crispy	Yes , this is the movie about a mysterious planet that looks a lot like a piece of chicken , extra crispy . . . not original recipe . The plot is a space craft disappears so another one is sent out to find what happened . Well they find a planet . . . one crew member dead the other lands on the planet . There he shrinks down in size when his mask opens and there is a small review of the movie up to that point . What he finds as a small guy is a race of people who really want him to stay to the point of offering him two women to choose from . Well our hero will have none of that , as he wants to go home no matter what , so he disrupts these people's way of life . He argues a lot with one guy who doesn't like the women of the planet swoon over the new boy . . . so they fight by holding a bike rack between them and try to force each other on a tile that can kill . Meanwhile , these dog aliens attack in ships that are on fire and a whole bunch of stuff happens and later we get to see a recap of the entire movie . All in all this is one to avoid , except on MST3k .
548539	1111192	94074	1.0	This is just terrible .	Simply put that is how I describe this one . None of the Supermans are really great , but they are ok . This one is just awful . . . I mean where do I begin . I might as well start with the budget . . . It just had to be extremely low . His flying looked worse in this than in the first one . Then there is the acting Reeve goes beyond mediocre in this one . . . here he sucks . I am guessing it was the director's job that made him tolerable in the first three . Not that anyone does a good job in this one including Gene Hackman who is also awful and just why did the feel the need to have Jon Cryer play his nephew ? Then the scientific errors . Somehow a strand of Superman's hair can hold up all this weight . . . I think it was a ton , but Lex Luthor cuts it with bolt cutters . Nuclear man takes a girl into space where there is plenty of air for her to breath apparently . And speaking of the villan , did they try to make him as lame as possible or what . This of course has to do with the plot , a whole movie devoted to telling us a nuclear war would be bad . . . Duh ! If Reeve thought this movie was going to cause world leaders to say " Gee , we shouldn't start a war and maybe we should disarm " , then he was fooling himself .
548416	1111192	58615	1.0	Before there was " Top Gun " there was STARFIGHTERS ! ! !	I am guessing , however , that this movie was not the inspiration for Top Gun . What to say about this one , well , for one thing it is hard to describe , but probably nearly impossible to spoil . Why you ask ? Well honestly there is no plot or anything startling revealed in this movie . I am not kidding when I say this either , almost the entire film is sort of a commercial for this jet , you would think the military planned on mass marketing them to the public or something . The only semblance of a plot is that these new recruits are learning to fly the starfighter jet and that is about it . You do not even get the competition of Top Gun . What you do get is more stock footage of jets flying than should be allowed in one movie . Lots of stock footage and lots of light music . I am thinking they got this movie from a department store elevator . Even during scenes that should have a bit tense music you still get the light stuff . As for the tense scenes there are like two . One a problem with hydraulics that went no where , the other a storm that is only implied and never shown that interrupts one flight and the second prolonged fueling scene in the movie . The rest of the film is clunky dialog , the main pilot focused on making his moves on a really stupid gal , strange telephone pranks that are not funny , and an annoying senator calling about his son . Oh yeah , I can not forget the the guys getting in a pool to test out their " poopy suit " . Then you have the most anti-climatic ending ever with more light music . I am thinking the makers of this film figured you did not need a plot . . . showing jet stock footage would be plenty to keep people entertained .
548652	1111192	60666	1.0	Why was this movie made !	Includes spoilersWhy did they make this movie ? Except for the female wrestling scene I can see no reason at all . This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen on MST 2000 and perhaps ever . The plot follows a family driving through the country in some backwoods area . They are apparently going on a vacation , but who vacations in the middle of nowhere . Apparently they are headed to the Valley Lodge which is such a popular place that there is only one sign directing the way . Somewhere they get lost along the way and end up at Torgo's place where he is housesitting for the master . Nothing in the world indicates that this is a hotel , yet the father insists Torgo a man with an obvious disability carry the luggage back and forth . The family's dog gets killed right after they get there and it is to bad , the dog was the best actor in the film . Somehow the parents lose their daughter after this as they have their back turned and she exits the room . They find the daughter outside and she leads them to the dreaded Master , who is apparently lying on rocks outside with his many wives ( what happens when it rains ? ) . After a while Torgo is killed by the master for doing naughty things to his immobile wives and the family runs into the desert where the little girl is getting so bored with this movie she stomps on a plant while the mother is crying and doing her scene . The father promptly gives away their position by shooting at stock footage of a rattlesnake . It ends with two gals heading to the popular Valley lodge and the father is the Master's new housekeeper and the mother and daughter enter the master's Harem ( sick , eh ? ) . Never watch this movie without MST 2000 .
548361	1111192	86972	1.0	Ator fights evil in all forms including puppets .	Yes this movie is obviously trying to be a Conan the Barbarian , and what amazes me is that this is a sequel ( the people demanded another one ? ) . The first part of the flick is a flashback showing the original . From what I saw it doesn't look worth checking out ( and apparently Ator always kills a huge puppet in his movies ) . Well now Ator lives at the ends of the earth with his mute sidekick Thong . A girl seeks his help as this evil dude has her father in his custody . Let me just say this bad guy is extremely patient as the old guy constantly insults the villian and just prattles on endlessly . The bad guy waits to the very end of the movie and finally smacks the old guy around leaving you to wonder " What took him so long to snap ? " . Meanwhile , Ator and his sidekick and the gal go through one adventure after another . They fight cavemen , invisible soldiers ( don't ask ) , rent a thugs , and people who worship snakes . Ator also battles a giant snake puppet and hang-glides ( again , don't ask ) . All the while you will be thinking that Conan would kick Ator's butt .
548172	1111192	53464	1.0	Oooooooh ! ! ! ! Prince of Space !	Aliens are invading the earth and boy , they are lame . That is right the super chickens lead by Krangor are attacking and the only one to save the day is Prince of Space , a slim guy who wears the dummest costume in the history of superheros ( you should see his cape ) . Anyway as lame as he is , the villians are worse and constantly loose to Prince of Space . But does Krangor give up ? No , he just laughs annoyingly and continues his seemingly purposeless assault on earth . First , he wants rocket fuel and once he gets it he wants something else . Meanwhile , he keeps shooting one weapon or another at Prince of Space , despite the fact that the Prince constantly tells him that their weapons are useless against him ( and they allows are useless against him too ) . Does Krangor give up ? No , he fights on using his giant to try to fight Prince of Space . Of course , the giant is also ineffective . In the end the Prince has to rescue these scientist who always have to say " oh , Prince of Space " , everytime he appears , and Krangor is defeated . I am guessing they were trying a Flash Gordon type of thing , but this movie made some Godzilla films I have seen seem worthy of an oscar by comparison .
549101	1111192	49287	1.0	The title doesn't really fit .	Sure it takes place in the west , but the title makes it seem like it is a conventional western . Instead , it is a movie of a woman sheriff . Make no mistake though this is a bad movie about a woman sheriff . She becomes sheriff when her husband is gunned down ; she is only a tad bit upset by this . Her main goal is to go after the villain who is also a woman , but the villain hires a guy to kill her . So this is what happens , the hero falls in love with the killer and vice versa . Utterly stupid , as anyone killed in this movie has the new sheriff to thank . She had more than a few chances to put the killer behind bars , but I guess because she liked him she wouldn't do it . The killer is also after the mayor of the town for personal reasons that are also rather dumb . This movie is very boring and not really worth watching . . . it is not one of the better episodes of MST3000 they made . I can not imagine anyone seeing this without them because that would make it that much more painful . Corman is a low budget director , but even he should know better than to have people go into one place and coming out another .
548880	1111192	58007	1.0	Hugo you are a ugly dummy who can't eat ham !	This movie is about a great ventriloquist who has the worst act imaginable , yet for some reason he performs in front of sold out crowds . He basically makes people uncomfortable and people pay to see him do this and to argue with his dummy about luncheon meat and wine . The doll has a secret though and it is up to William Sylvester to find out what and this isn't exactly exciting to watch either . Some how the dummy is alive containing the soul of a former employee of The Great Vorelli ( the ventriloquist ) . There is one murder in this one , but for the most part it is just Vorelli talking down to Hugo ( the dummy ) and putting the moves on Sylvester's girlfriend by hypnotizing her to like him . We also see a lot of Vorelli's assistants butt . What gets me is that Sylvester's character suspects Vorelli of wrongdoing , but when his girlfriend says she wants to marry Vorelli he just accepts it and walks away . All in all a rather drab picture to watch , but the ending is rather funny .
548383	1111192	50530	2.0	Typical 50's teen horror .	This one doesn't appeal to me much . For the most part I think the movie takes itself too seriously , considering it is called I was a teenage werewolf . You just expect the movie to be more fun , less drabby . Landon does a rather good job , but his character is thoroughly unlikable . So is much of the cast . The plot revolves around Landon as a troubled teen who gets into a lot of fights at school . He goes to a doctor to treat him and for some reason this guy can turn you into a wolf for some reason . Why does he do it ? Who knows , he says it is for science . . . I just think he has too much time on his hands . We get to put up with a lame teen party in this one where some guy sings badly , and then another party after Tony's ( Landon's character ) treatment where he kills this guy who walks through the deep woods for a shortcut . Then the police are involved and so is a janitor who is rather pointless in the movie . Wolf kills gal in gym , and now the police know they are after a werewolf . They go into the woods to track him , but you know the doctor is going to be in the finale .
548716	1111192	87258	2.0	Joe Don after final justice .	Joe Don Baker is an alright to good actor in small roles here and there . . . he was alright in Goldeneye and made a pretty good Bond villan in The Living Daylights and has appeared in various other movies . One thing he can't do is carry a movie as the lead , which he is in this extremely bad revenge movie set in Malta . Joe Don's partner is killed so he kills the killer's brother and escorts the killer to Italy , but some guys cause the plane to set down in Malta and the killer gets away . The rest of the movie is seeing Joe Don chase the killer here and there , Joe Don getting taken into custody various times , Joe Don torturing a bartendar and being interrupted and so on . The movie is quite bad and you won't find yourself exactly pulling for Joe Don's character . You will be amazed at how many times Joe Don the hero gets taken out by one punch and how incompetent he proves to be . The crowning part of the movie comes when Joe Don chases the killer all over Malta with the killer in a priest robe and then they get in boats and he chases them all around Malta . This movie also features one of the worst closing lines to end a movie ever .
549016	1111192	92006	2.0	What happens when you kill off the characters to fast .	This movie starts out as a cheap rip-off of " Aliens " . A monster has gotten aboard a ship and it is methodically killing of the crew . Some interesting deaths , but nothing special . Well before you know it the entire crew with the exception of two of them is dead . I think this was supposed to be a wrap , but then they realized their film was way too short . Some one said " We need more movie here people " . So they brainstormed and the person who said " Let's make this into a family movie " must have won out . I am not going to say when this happens in the flick , but you will easily be able to tell yourself if you have the misfortune to watch this movie . I love how the deaths are rationalized . So if you want to see an " Alien " clone that does a complete 180 near the end then this is the movie for you .
548203	1111192	73629	2.0	What is the big deal ?	This movie is a cult hit , as people like to dress up as the characters and throw toast at the screen during their midnight screenings . However , for the most part , this film is awful to me . First off , it is a musical . . . and I hate musicals for the most part so me hating it could not be helped . Second , this movie has such an awful plot . . . what is the point of any of this ? Third , the singing of Susan Surandon and Barry Bostwick is totally awful even if I did like musicals . The story has a couple that wants to get married getting stranded on their way to a friend's house . They seek shelter in a nearby castle full of dancing and singing people . Then Tim Curry makes this guy and that is about it other than some really dumb plot twists ( What is up with the ending ? ) . The only parts I can say anything good about are the time warp dance scene and the scene with Meatloaf mainly because they are very high energy . Also , Surandon and Bostwick aren't doing the singing so the songs aren't totally butchered . Another interesting point is Charles Gray recounting the story . It is nice to see a former Bond villain doing the role of the criminologist . All in all though if you like musicals you may want to check it out if you have time to kill , but for the most part this movie did not appeal to me at all . I also think it is pointless to scream at the movie or throw toast or water at the screen . Quite frankly , you can do that with any movie if you wanted to , there is nothing that really indicates that this movie was made to do stuff like that .
548482	1111192	55452	2.0	Wow , never before has there been so many riveting desk scenes in one movie ! ! !	This movie actually starts out promisingly enough as they have a scene showing a smutty film shoot . You see a few girls dressed skimpily and while this obviously is not going to be a good movie , at least there will be something to look at . However what we get is basically no more scenes of this type as this movie is mainly against such evils as a female showing a little skin . So we basically have cops correlating the porn industry to murders and theft and all organized crime , of course they neglect to inform people that if you make something that people really want illegal organized crime moves in and makes a profit on it . Of course , let me not cheapen this fine movie by acting like it has any redeeming values or that it is a good movie to start a frank discussion , it just sucks . I mean from the random scenes here and there to scene after scene after scene of the two cops at that one desk ! ! ! This movie is very dull and to think it started with a rather nice looking gal running from apparently no one and then being killed the first moment she stops and then the cool shoot to desk scenes aplenty and the most shrilled voiced woman ever to be filmed on the big screen . Here is another film that makes another low budget murder mystery " the Dead Talk Back " seem like an Oscar caliber movie by comparison . . . I most certainly don't want to see another of Ed Wood's films unless of course he was less serious in his later works . I mean you are making a low budget piece of dung , just have fun and do crazy things , don't try to shove a message down the viewer's throat ! ! !
548967	1111192	71198	2.0	Title is kinda misleading	I saw this movie on mystery science theater when it was called " It lives by night " . That title is much less misleading than " Batpeople " . In fact it would more accurately be called Batperson . This movie is about a doctor who studies bats I am thinking because he wants to make a better cure for rabies . This is not really clear . What is clear is that he and his wife take a tour of a cave and he gets bitten by a bat . Why a scientist needs to take a tour to study bats is beyond me . Shouldn't he be able to go in by himself . Well after being bitten he and his wife go on their honeymoon where he starts having fits . They go to the worst doctor ever . The guy stays in the hospital and kills a nurse . In the end the guy kills 3-4 people and his wife stands by him and you are supposed to be rooting for him instead of the sheriff investigating the murders .
548619	1111192	59786	2.0	Who could the killer be ? Maybe that obvious fellow over there in the shadows !	Yes , I knew who the killer was when he appeared on screen the first time . No hints were needed I just thought it was telegraphed a bit to much . Look at me , aren't I the obvious killer ! ! ! Well the movie is about a strangler who targets women , not just teens as one of the victims is an older lady . Of course , the law suspects Jimmy of the crime . . . why not ? He was out that night , having snuck out of his house to make out with his gal . Quite frankly , she just about fingers him as she sees the crime in progress and thinks she recognizes the jacket as belonging to a gang of really slow racer dudes . Yes , nothing all that surprising in this one as the only thing that did shock me was how awful that song was they were singing in the diner scene . Oh , and the shower scene , actually rather good considering the time the movie was made . . . it actually seemed a tad risqué . So while it was not a great movie , in fact quite bad it was still not boring to watch and kept ones focus .
548381	1111192	93066	2.0	I can't believe this is rated so high .	For me , it just didn't seem like GI Joe at all . When I watched it as a kid , I just didn't care for it . In fact the part I liked best about this one was the opening credits . They change so many facts around and turn the story around as well . Cobra Commander is supposedly part of this stupid race of reptile people in Antarctica or somewhere that is frozen . Though I always thought he was a normal guy considering every time you saw his eyes in the series they were surrounded by normal colored flesh and not the blue his face was here . There is just too much crap in this one to try and make this a spectacular movie , but for me it just ruins what I watched the series for in the first place .
548344	1111192	418627	3.0	Sadly the highlight of this flick was the girls in their lingerie .	Quite frankly , the only highlight is only going to appeal to guys and even this does not save the longest 97 minute movie in the history of movies . I mean I swear the running time seemed about an hour longer than it says it was . Well I should talk about the plot a bit so here goes . It starts out as a very uneven movie as they show you flashbacks here and now this and that and the other . I mean it was a rather hard movie to follow at first , but hey after awhile this stops and you are left wishing the movie would return to that format because at least it is distracting . Five girls are brought into a haunted hospital to spend five hours . . . it is meant as nothing more than a stunt , but then people are killed . . . I think . I wasn't to sure thanks to all the flashing back and forward going on . Well eventually it becomes clear there is something going on and it isn't pretty . However , our five girls are and seeing them run around the place in their undergarments proves to be a nice distraction for a minute or two . However , this becomes a really tedious movie really fast with really stupid revelations also in flashback and in black and white pictures . It does have one rather good death scene , but for the most part I nearly slipped into a coma and I just wanted it to end . The film is also badly shot , I mean it looks like some generic show from mtv or something and the outside shots of the hospital don't really inspire fear , but rather the question " why the hell are they using day for night on the exterior of a building ? " I mean day for night is a nifty device , but a couple of flashlights or something on the building at night would look better than what we had here . This occurred on the inside to , as it was clearly daytime throughout the entire movie . Then we come to the end when the " deathtunnel " is revealed , yes the 500 feet of pure terror that was promised us on the back of the DVD . Well let me just say , you will be disappointed as less happens here than in the rest of the movie and not a lot happens in the rest of the movie ! ! ! Finally , we have an uber stupid ending to go along with our stupid film and the credits roll and clearly the film makers know what the only thing worth watching was as they show us our girls in their lingerie dancing at a party as the credits roll .
548301	1111192	74285	3.0	Teenage comes of age flick .	This story is of Carrie , a girl who is picked on to the ridicules extreme right at the beginning of the movie . The girls who pick on her are punished and one goes to the extreme to get revenge on the girl who had nothing really to do with her getting into trouble . This one is so much like a typical day at a high school that it is boring . Of course Carrie has a secret . . . her mom's psycho . So when the teacher tells her about the problems Carrie has at school , she proceeds to beat Carrie and tell her how evil she is . You just know she has a complex . Carrie also has special powers too . So a nice girl lets Carrie go to the prom with her boyfriend , the bad girl dumps something on Carrie at prom and all heck breaks loose . This film is just too mundane in some areas for it to be interesting . Nothing you see is really all that revolutionary here . . . teens have been this way to each other forever . The only thing interesting , or that is a new wrinkle is the powers and the really horrific prom , which for me just isn't enough to save the flick , but I can see why others like it . It just isn't for me .
548802	1111192	113492	3.0	Just Dredd-Ful ( I know this has probably been done already )	I didn't really expect much when I went to see this one and boy I wasn't disappointed . The problem here is that Rob Schneider is probably the best part of the whole film as the comic relief . . . so you know it can't be to good . Diane Lane is a complete waste of time in this piece , but of course nearly every action movie made since 1990 has to have the great super female who can fight every bit as well as the men . And then there is Stallone , who is speaking less clearly with every movie that he makes . The plot seems more fit for a sequel as we are only briefly introduced to Dredd and learn what he is as he is framed rather quickly . There is one scene in the desert wasteland that is ok , but other than that this film is just bad . Sure some of the effects are pretty good , but effects alone just don't make a movie worth watching in the end .
548945	1111192	144528	3.0	You basically saw the funny stuff in the commercials .	Usually , you will have one are two funny scenes that are totally unexpected in a comedy that you don't even see a hint of in the commercial . For this movie if you seen the barrage of previews for this commercial , then you have seen all the funniest scenes period . By the time I saw this at the theater the scenes were very stale as they repeated the commercials so much it was pathetic . This one has a bit more of the family in it , which was the highlight of the first one . To bad they are not as funny in larger doses . The plot has Sherman somehow extracting the part of him that is Buddy Love . This form somehow comes to life on its own and starts wrecking havoc . This was such an awful plot device you wonder why it is even there . Why have Buddy Love return , is it just to show the audience that Eddie Murphy is actually in shape or what ? This movie also has to many scenes where it takes itself to seriously and gets to sappy . What is the matter with just having a comedy without the tender moments ? Tender moments are not what I go to a comedy to see most of the time and this is a movie I was expecting none . If you saw the many advertisements of this one , don't bother . . . you have seen all the funniest parts . If you haven't seen much on it , you may want to give it a go .
548289	1111192	109838	3.0	Well a better Randy Quaid movie than " Martian's Go Home " .	This movie is a parody type movie . . . though there is not a particular movie being spoofed here . More along the lines of a " Top Secret " as this movie has its own plot and stands on its own . And for that I commend it . I just did not find it all that funny . Sure I liked a couple of the jokes like the part where the music is playing and Randy's character tells them to shut the music off . The story basically has this guy who is some sort of star traveling along the countryside and running into a freak show . Well he soon becomes the freak show's main attraction as the owner of said show makes his freaks with a bizarre device . Of course , before this we have a scene where the star is being interviewed by Brooke Shields in a talk show type setting . So basically the movie is sort of a recount of what happened . So we have a bunch of freaks to get to know as well as the star's traveling companions become Siamese twins , there is a worm guy , a strange sock puppet guy and you even get to see Mr . T as a bizarre woman . Though the saddest tale is that of the one tool that became another ( have to admit , that was pretty funny ) . Still , for the most part I just did not enjoy the movie , however , there are worse ways to spend one's time .
548768	1111192	376109	3.0	Was it possible to win this game ?	This game brought about many nightmares and hours of play as a child trying desperately to win what I still have no clue on how to win . I hear some people say they won it and you basically see the scene right at the beginning in reverse . You are basically Indy , you pick up the whip right at the beginning and you can choose to fight wave after wave of snakes with said whip or you can go to the market and maybe by a grenade or parachute or something . You can even find a revolver in a garbage can . You can use said grenade to blow a hole in the screen with the snakes and go through a level with no dangers and some sort of clock to a room that is apparently cliffs , a strange marsh with the strangest looking spider ever , to a room where you get trapped in boxes . You have a treasure room beyond the room with the boxes . You have a strange land below the cliffs where a man in black roams , the black market , a strange area with a mound of dirt that just takes you back to the cliffs , the map room that shows nothing even when you have the staff of ra , the black market which has more snakes and how any of this ties in together is beyond me .
548992	1111192	57569	3.0	Other than seeing a young Jack Nicholson and an old Karloff this one isn't really worth seeing .	You get to see Nicholson and Karloff , that makes it somewhat watchable , but the muddled story and the lack of anything really exciting happening makes this movie a bit of a bore . Well one person is killed in a rather gruesome way , but other than that nothing much happens . This one has Nicholson as a soldier who is seperated from the rest of his troops . He meets a girl who seemingly wants to lead him to his death . He eventually stumbles upon an old castle and inside is a bit of a crazy old count . Nothing really shocking about it as it is a bit more mystery than horror . The mystery I am afraid is a bit to confusing and rather pointless to be very good . The end revelation is very stupid as it does not seem to add up at all . Still though you do get to see an old actor on his way down and a new actor ( at that time anyway ) on his way up .
548668	1111192	92974	3.0	Almost painful to watch at times .	Other than this movie featuring Ernest from all those wacky commercials , this movie just plays out as your basic summer camp movie . Why is it so bad , because you have Ernest as the main character , plus very annoying children , and a silly subplot involving some company trying to take over the camp . I just do not think the Ernest character should be center stage for a movie . The short lived television show was the only thing this character needed as it featured other characters and such to draw some of the focus away from Ernest himself . Lets face it , the character got his start in commercials as a rather annoying individual and it was funny to see him torment Vern , but more funny to see Vern get back at Ernest for bothering him in the first place . The movie here would feature a couple of the characters from the television show as cooks and they provide some comedy and Ernest has his moments . However , most of the movie is rather groan inducing and to top it off it gets overly sentimental at times as well . I can not really recommend this movie unless perhaps you have seen his other movies and liked them . Granted if you have seen them I am sure you saw this his first movie .
548508	1111192	82427	3.0	I liked the book better .	I know many of you are saying , " Book , what book ? " . There was a book , however , it was a book based on the screenplay and was written by Dean Koontz under another name . So basically , a book written simply to cash in on the release of a movie . This case Tobe Hooper's " The Funhouse " . I read the book before I saw the movie , I didn't even know there was a movie until then and I thought it might be a rather good movie . Unfortunately , Koontz did a bit to well in fleshing out characters and adding plot twists and his book had a little to much depth . Because the actually movie was rather slow moving , not that many people to kill , and the characters were cardboard cutouts found in any horror movie released at the time . So suffice to say I was disappointed , especially how the movie was so empty of any of the really interesting stuff included in the book . So what do we get , some kids stuck in a fun house being stalked by a deformed killer . Very " Friday the 13th " or any number of horror movies at the time .
548672	1111192	93516	4.0	Well it is the summer I guess .	Yes , it being the summer is the only thing that remotely ties this film to the first two movies . That being said I did enjoy this movie more than part two , however , you can see by my score of four that I still did not like this movie overall . It had potential and I think its low score here of 2 . 8 has a lot to do with the fact it tries to pass itself off as a sequel to a set of movies it has nothing remotely in common with . However , that being said overall it was still a poor comedy with the typical teen sex comedy plot . . . guy wants to lose virginity . The twist , a ghost of a porn star must try and help him . Of course , my question is why does he need help ? He is pals with a cute girl who would obviously be more than willing to have sex with him , I mean she is watching a porno with him . Still , if it were that easy there would be no movie . However , that may have been a good thing in this case . Still , it has a couple of good comedy moments and far less groan inducing humor than part two ( though it has its fair share as well ) . So there you have it , we go from family oriented comedy to a teen sex romp in three films .
548901	1111192	83866	4.0	Liked it at first .	As a kid my parents burned me out taking me to this film . Every day they wanted to get rid of my sister and me for the day they took us to E . T . By the third or fourth time , I really began not to really care for this movie to the point of being incapable of wanting to watch it again . The story is simple though and good for kids to watch . Even as a kid though I got quickly bored of this on and today I never want to see it again . I will say I really enjoyed it the first and second time I saw it , but I have to say this movie is definitely for kids and they will get the most enjoyment of seeing Elliot help the little alien call his friends to pick him up . This movie was also a really big advertisement for the candy Reese's pieces . . . they were basically unheard of before this movie .
548197	1111192	120685	4.0	So why wasn't Godzilla in the movie ?	This is a movie I looked forward to for a year . I have always enjoyed Godzilla flicks and now we the Americans were going to make it with all our special effects and know how . I can not tell you how disappointed I was with this movie . One of my main gripes ( and certainly not the only one ) was Godzilla himself / herself . It looked nothing like the Japan version . It sounded like him ( because theirs is a guy ) and that is it . I heard that Sony had to show them our version before hand and Toho had to approve . . . why did they approve of that ? Not only did it not look like Godzilla , but it did not act like Godzilla . Godzilla does not burrow underground he just stomps through the city . Suffice to say those missles would have crashed into him with no effect . Godzilla is bigger than they portrayed as well , and he breaths much cooler looking fire breath that the American version . Let's face it the Japan version would kick our version's but in about five minutes , the only reason it would last that long is the fact is moved like a raptor from Jurrassic Park . It was also killed to easily , the Japan version would never be taken down that easily . . . they always have to come up with some new and innovative way of getting him back in the sea , not just slam a couple of missiles into him . And what is up with him being pregnet , sure the Japan version had a son that was never quite explained , but ours has to have a litter of raptors . And Godzilla is not a lizard , but a dinosaur a mix of T-rex and stegasauros . I would have had a sub accident in the polar region to have him born , because I have never heard of a creature migrating north to give birth . Then of course there is the story that was dumb . . . they evacuated the city in five minutes so there goes the fun of seeing people flee , you get to see a woman trying to advance her reporting career ( was that really necessary ) , and our military is hardly in the film except for a few scenes , yet the French military is for some reason ( I don't think they could have ever traced Godzilla back to them ) .
548842	1111192	83133	4.0	Should have stuck to being pure comedy .	For the most part this movie is a comedy , but for some reason in other parts it tries to be a serious horror movie . Just the fact that the killer is talking through a rubber chicken should really convince the director not to take the movie too seriously . Let me just saw when it is trying to be funny it is alright , but when it is not it just doesn't fit . I mean you begin to wonder if you are watching the same film . The last part of the film is almost totally devoid of humor .
548913	1111192	72750	4.0	Almost two movies .	This had potential , but in the end it is just not all that good . This is like two movies though . In movie 1 these bugs come out of the ground after an earthquake . They have the ability to start fires and stuff like that . Some guy's wife is killed by the killer bugs fire ability and this ticks him off . The bugs actually start to die off as they aren't used to the pressure and they just explode . This starts movie 2 which finds the guy whose wife is killed hanging on to one of the bugs and using some pressure thing to keep it alive . He proceeds to mate it with an everyday bug and makes mutant bugs . Why you ask ? Cause he can . The bugs are for reasons unknown seem to be intelligent . The ending to this one is pretty weird too . All in all it would have been better with more deaths or something , as is it isn't anything special .
548779	1111192	99461	4.0	Another pointless movie .	This movie almost plays as a sequel as whoever wrote it seems to think you should know what is going on so he isn't going to take the time to explain it . The " plot " and I am using the term loosely is I am guessing a bunch of rich people in corporations make bets based on two guys fighting to the death . Sounds simple enough , but wait . . . somehow one of the warriors is able to come back from the dead . How ? Who knows . . . it has something to do with this gal who I think was some kind of sorceress . This is never really touched upon much , but hey she is cute and I think that is why she is stuck in this one . Nothing much to be said for the fighting as it involves Robert Z'Dar and some other guy . When I first saw this movie I only caught the end and wondered why the heck Z'Dar was dressed as a knight and he was going around killing people ( his character goes berserk or something and starts killing more than just the guy he is fighting ) . I thought this was some movie about time travel , which would have been better than what it was really about . You occasionally flash to these board members watching the fight and other stuff . . . it does have a rather catchy tune to it and it is rather short so it wasn't all bad . As I have said though it plays like a sequel to something .
549185	1111192	95271	5.0	Okay , so we are going to ignore the fact that both Myers and Loomis burned to death .	An almost good sequel , that falls prey to many wtf moments and the fact that this sequel just shouldn't have been made . With Halloween you have part 1 and 2 , which go together . 3 isn't really related to the series much at all , then you can pick your sequels . Either 4 , 5 , and 6 . . . or you can choose 7 , 8 , and soon to be 9 as the sequels as your choice . My choice is neither , I will always think of part 2 as the end of Myers and Loomis , if you saw the way Myers was killed and the fact the flames burned his face so bad you could make out his skull then you would consider him dead too . That and his eyes were shot out . People , though , just loved Myers as a killer too much so they brought him back in a sequel that almost works . Myers eyes are never explained , I mean they would transplant eyes onto a comatose serial killer would they ? However , both he and the good doctor Loomis played by Donald Pleasance who is a bright spot in this movie have some minor burns . Both were engulfed in flames , but they only have simple scars from the flames here and there . This time Myers is going after his niece , and man the girl who is playing her is awful and she doesn't improve in the next installment . Myers goes on a rampage killing people while Loomis tracks him down . Nothing new or original and for some reason I just don't get the Halloween vibe I got from the first two . In the first two the trick or treaters seemed real , here it all seems to set up . As for the wtf moments , one occurs when the niece and her sister ( apparently the niece was adopted after her mother was killed in a wreck and that would have been the Jamie Lee Curtis character ) are on a roof . Myers is up there too , and the girls fall off , less than 5 seconds later Myers is on the ground again coming from behind the house . How the heck did he get down so fast ? Were there stairs behind the house ? The next moment is when they are on a truck with a posse heading for the state police headquarters . Somehow Myers comes from underneath the truck and starts killing . This is impossible as a scene earlier clearly showed no one was under the truck . There are a couple more of these moments . However , this one has its moments and it to me is a better sequel than any that came after it including the H2O one .
548805	1111192	171363	5.0	CGI and horror just don't mix .	I like CGI . . . I think it has its place in movies . Some people say the Hulk will have too much CGI , but I say it is the type of movie that should . Horror , however , should not have too much . . . or any at all when possible . This one starts out promising enough as we are introduced to the characters . . . though the situation the one woman was in was a tad ridiculous ( that kid , you know who ) . Then you get to look over the house then promptly two of the characters leave . . . leaving less fodder to be killed . Then again this is a haunted house movie so that is ok . Neeson , Wilson , Jones , and Taylor do all right at the beginning . Then the cgi nightmare begins as every scare is like a cgi statue that anyone who isn't blind can tell is not really there . Of course the scene with the fireplace with the skeleton is the only scene that made anyone scream out in the theater I was in , and the later scene with Owen Wilson and the fireplace was also pretty good . The conclusion , though , is one big cgi effect .
549079	1111192	100740	5.0	The fact that this movie was originally supposed to be another Creepshow sequel helps me understand .	Understand what you ask ? Why this movie to me just does not have the feel of the television series it is named from and does seem to have more of a Creepshow feel to it . None of the three stories seems like it would ever have played on the television show with the introduction story of the little boy being held by the crazy woman probably being the most like it came from the show . The first story seems straight out of the HBO series " Tales from the Crypt " with the second one having more of the " Creepshow feel and the final one almost having more of a Twilight Zone quality to it . The first story has one guy killing people with the help of a mummy , not really much to it , but it does have the most stars in it as you will recognize quite a few of the people featured in it . The second one is my favorite , but not really going to garner to much mention as a hit-man is requested by a rather eccentric old man to exterminate a rather strange target . The target in question is that of a cat . The final story is about a man who witnesses a strange killing and is told to keep it a secret , his life seems to be going well , but he is still haunted by what he saw that evening . This story is really to tame with the exception of the beginning and the end . Then of course the story of the boy and his captor is wrapped up . It has a few ups and is far from awful , it just is not that good either as the show had much better stories .
548931	1111192	60865	5.0	Don't be fooled by the credits , Lee is not the main star in this one .	This movie would lead you to believe that Christopher Lee is the main star , but he is not in it all that much . He is in this one more than he was in " Scream and Scream Again " , but for most of his scenes he is wearing a hood . This movie was sort of good , sort of bad . The opening of the movie was messed up on the copy I got as scenes skipped here and there and the sound was messed up too , but as the movie went along it got better . This movie first shows a complicated armored truck robbery in to much detail . It then shifted to the circus where the police tracked some of the money . In the circus we meet all sorts of strange characters ; any number of them could be responsible for the robbery and a murder that took place on circus grounds . Of course , the movie leads you to believe this or that person committed the crime and each time they usually clear the person of the crime . Could have been better , but it could have been worse it was somewhat interesting . Has to be one of the only movies ever to end with a little person being fired .
548475	1111192	932936	5.0	The creed of the assassin must be to do the same thing over and over again .	When I first started playing this game it was rather good . I had heard that a lot of gaming magazines had given this game mediocre reviews and I could not understand why . The game was really fun right there at the beginning and then you had a huge world to ride through and towns to explore . Not to mention the graphics are simply stunning . However , the game play for me got very tiring after awhile . Had I given this game a review on the first two or three hours after I had started playing it I would have give this game a nine or ten , however , after the initial impact of the game and a few of the same missions over and over I just got sick and tired of this game and I was very happy to win this game and be done with it . Yes , this game gets very repetitive , you are in a huge world and the only things you have to do are save citizens , collect flags , and climb towers to complete your maps . Granted you can fight guards too , but this also becomes a very tedious and annoying too . You kill twenty guards sometimes and still other guards want to fight you . I mean after awhile you would think they would retreat . The story is very talky and rather boring , I got tired of hearing the master and student talk to each other . Then you get sent out on missions to kill where stealth just does not play all that important a role as one might think . The controls are also choppy as you can duck into hay to hide from soldiers , but there is a lag that sometimes gets you spotted before you leap into the hay , which is funny as other times when you are simply jumping from here to there your stupid character seems to get sucked into the hay . Fighting is also a bit lacking as all you mainly do is counter attack and quickly dispatch most of the enemies . There are no really big battles till the end and by then you just want the pain to stop as this game actually gave me headaches nearly every time I played it . Especially when I took time to save the annoying citizens who say all of four different things when you rescue them . Then you have your annoying citizens you wish you could kill , but you can not such as the begging women and the crazy people who hit you . Still , the first level which was basically a walk through was fun as it was set in some sort of run down temple underground and your mission to use logs to get rid of some soldiers was fun and made me think this game would be really special , the first assassination was fun too as was visiting my first major city . However , after I got over my initial awe I was underwhelmed by mission variety and ready for the game to end . . . and to top it all off it had a rather bad ending with generic credits and the music was nothing special either .
549086	1111192	64393	5.0	Wow for a bad movie it is sort of good . . . GREEN SLIME ! ! ! !	Yes , what to say about this movie written apparently by Americans , produced and directed by Japanese , and starring American and Italian actors and actresses . You have to say it is a fun movie to watch even though it is rather bad too . It is also rather good as well ! ! ! Yes , this movie is a mixed bag to be sure , but overall it is fun to watch because even the badness of the movie is fun to see . It also has lots of hot gals in it , somewhat brutal kills for a movie of this type , and you get rather strange tentacled beasties that are green , but do not really look all that much like slime . Well they did start off looking more like slime in their more " young " form I guess you would call it . Basically , it is an alien gets on board spaceship and cause havoc movie , and you can not really say this one copied Alien as this came out well before it . The effects are right out of a Godzilla movie , the monsters look like they were scheduled to fight Godzilla in Godzilla vs Hedorah , but got fired for not looking slimy enough and somehow managed to land a gig playing green slime . You get to see a lot of weapons fired at the seemingly impossible to kill slime , which is fine by one scientist who seems to really want to befriend them or something . Then you have a rather cool conclusion and then you have that awesome song at the end . Is this a good movie ? Most certainly not , but it is just hard to bash a movie that has such great campiness and hot gals , and cool cheap effects and a hell of a uplifting song . . . GREEEEEN SLIMMMME ! ! ! !
548609	1111192	93036	5.0	Not good , not bad .	This movie had its moments , and then it had its moments of pure boredom . Apparently , this was based on a book . . . and from what I have read in the comments there was a lot more to the books . This one has a family who has recently lost a dad moving in with the most evil grandma ever . She apparently hates the four kids of this family very much . . . you learn why , so I won't spoil anything . The kids get locked away in a room that has access to an attic ( hence the title ) . The mother occasionally visits them , but seems not to care for them too much . Why the kids wait till they are very sick to try and escape is beyond me as it would be apparent to anyone that the mother didn't care for them too much . This movie for the most part is very depressing and dark and has minimal scenery or sets . . . it is interesting though in some aspects . Watching them pass away time in the attic , getting more and more antsy as they spend their days waiting for the mother to return . In the end though it isn't anything great , so you may want to skip this one .
548144	1111192	332047	6.0	Fairly predictable romantic comedy , but worthy of a couple of laughs .	The only reason I saw this movie was because I was out on a date and I let her choose the movie . . . if it had been me I would have chosen the new " Amityville " remake . However , while this may not be the type of movie I usually like to see , it had some funny moments in it and it wasn't a boring movie either . Though it also is not a movie that is going to throw you off , or trick you either . It plays rather straight forward and is predictable , you will basically know the ending before it gets there and you will know just about everything else before it happens . Still though , it is not a bad movie and it caused a chuckle or two . This movie focuses on a couple , one a workaholic , the other a raving Boston Red Sox fan . You see the start of their relationship and watch it build over the movie and through a season of baseball where it really has its moments of near collapse . Barrymore and Fallon are rather good here , and both play there parts well , though I do like the way Fallon portrays a fan who is super obsessed with his team .
548885	1111192	89530	6.0	Not as good as the Road Warrior .	This film is ok , but it is not as good as the above-mentioned flick . Hopefully , when Fury Road comes out , it is more like Warrior and less like Thunderdome . Thunderdome finds Max having all his stuff stolen by a pilot played by Bruce Spence , just like the second one , but I don't believe they are supposed to be the same character . Max makes his way to a scummy town called " Barter Town " . He meets Tina Turner who does pretty good and they form an alliance to kill this one big guy in Thunderdome . . . an arena where fights to settle disputes takes place . There is a fight and Mad Max does in fact go beyond thunderdome , unfortunately the movie gets a bit weak in this section . Max runs into some kids in an oasis who tell really boring speeches and get facts all messed up . This goes on for a bit and finally there is more action as some of these kids go to " Barter Town " and Max has to get to them first . Then there is scenes involving a train that aren't as good as the truck battle in Road Warrior , but it is better than listening to those kids tell their stupid stories . All in all it is an ok film , but nothing great .
548645	1111192	92076	6.0	This chainsaw movie is a bit strange and has a crazy vibe to it .	This one was made in the 80's and it shows . The music , the picture quality everything screams 80's . It also has a bit of a Italian zombie movie feel to it as well thanks to the music and the make up by Tom Savani . . . this movie just seems kind of weird . The only remaining cast member from the original appears to be the cook from the first movie and he plays his role about the same . Gunnar isn't back to be Leatherface which is a shame , but the guy who took his place is all right . The story has a ranger or something played by Dennis Hopper looking for the chainsaw family as his relatives were killed in the original movie . The location of our favorite family , underground in what appears to be a theme park of some sort making award winning chili and preparing meats for all those hungry football fans . And yes this one adds a touch of demented humor to the mix . A really nice looking DJ with great legs happens to record a couple of dummies being killed by the chainsaw clan and tries to help Hopper find them , he ends up using her to find them . I found this movie okay , but to many underground scenes and another dinner scene kind of drag the movie down a bit . I would have liked to see them out and about more like in the first gruesome kill . There is a cool chainsaw fight at the end in which I have read where people have complained it was to short , but I thought it lived up to expectations . I do think I prefer the more recent remakes , however , as they portray Leatherface as a lot more intimidating , here he doesn't even get a good send off .
548347	1111192	454919	6.0	I enjoyed it better than the original version , but really nothing new .	Yes , this movie was a bit of a knock off of the ring , grudge and any other Japanese remake made in the past four or five years , still though I enjoyed it a bit . I thought it moved rather fast , and it was not boring for me so there you go . If I was a film critic I would lament the movie and curse its ever being made , but as just a dude who likes horror movies I liked it okay enough . This movie is a remake of a Japanese movie called " Kairo " , and I found this movie to be better than that one . It had better images and scary stuff . That movie was a bit overlong and did not really explain anything at all . However , this movie did explain to much . . . let me just say if you combine the two movies you would probably have a really good scary movie . This one is typical , everything is told to us and to be frank I hated the whole stealing the will to live thing . This was not in the original , but then this one only has some scenes that resemble each other and some of the plot is similar as well , but for the most part they are different . The movie has an eerie force coming through computers and other devices of a communication nature and coming after people . That is the extent of the film , nothing groundbreaking and certainly nothing original as the back of the box claims . I think it was wireless magazine that said it was the most original horror movie of the year , I am guessing this is the only one he has seen . This movie is more about ghosts coming to get you , while the Japanese version was more of a tale of loneliness and isolation that only gets touched on once here . So should you watch it . . . I don't know , if you are like me and give horror movies a break and enjoy them for what they are , an hour and a half cheesy diversion , then see it . If you tend not to like movies of this nature , basically " The Ring " and stuff skip it , you will not like it .
548206	1111192	87050	6.0	Some good stuff in the cornfield .	There are some rather good scenes in this one though it is nothing special . The best scenes are when the kids first go on the rampage and another is when the one kid tries to escape through the cornfield and the corn opens up a lane for him . For the most part though not too much happens till the end and there isn't much in the way of killings after the two scenes I described . If you ever read the story though you know that there wasn't much to it so they did an all right job with this movie version . Though I definitely would not recommend this one be shown to kids like the one poster does . Not that it would scare them , but to show kids killing parents and being in a cult might not be such a good idea . Quite a few of the kids in this one look older than what they are portraying in this one . That isn't too strange though as it is done quite often . Though the kids that help the two adults who are passing through are most definitely kids , and they do a pretty good job . This one needed more though to be really good . More atmosphere , more mystery , and more killings .
548179	1111192	159414	6.0	Okay , just could have been better .	For an adult film it is shot very well and stuff , but with the exception of the magazine scene the movie's sex scenes left a bit to be desired . The first scene involving a teacher is rather good in its set up , but it leaves you wanting more as the actual sex lasts maybe a minute with to much lead up to it . A scene at a gym just does not really get going good at all as once again the actual sex is not really all that great same with a car scene . The two scenes that actually have rather good sex are the end scene involving two gals and a guy and the highlight of the movie , the second scene involving all the magazine girls in a rather nice lesbian scene . By far the best scene to me as you had lots of girls the only thing I did not care about that scene is the occasional shots of the guy rubbing himself . However , even in the scenes that do not hit a bullseye the women are really cute and have that 80's flair to them as I always think girls of the 80's are still some of the hottest there was as they had really pretty hair and wore lots of eye shadow . Granted the 70's girls were rather pretty too as they had a more natural look . All in all if they would have just had a bit more actual sex and less foreplay in the other scenes it would have been a much better adult film .
548798	1111192	73373	6.0	Not as good as first Mechagodzilla movie .	This one starts out ( in the American version anyway ) , basically combining the two battles between Godzilla and MechaGodzilla from the previous movie while editing out the stupid furry monster . The aliens have rebuilt MechaGodzilla and with the help of a scientist have gained the help of another monster called Titanasaurous ( I know that is probably spelled wrong ) . Of course you know there is going to be a big battle with these two going against a solo Godzilla . There is also a subplot involving some guy in love with the scientist's daughter and a weapon designed to hurt the dinosaur with the hard to spell name . The battle is pretty good in this one , cause this time there is no stupid monster to help Godzilla and steal the glory like the dumb fuzzy monster in this one . Though I still liked that one better .
548387	1111192	70948	6.0	A good movie . . . I think .	I am still not sure what this movie is about . I have seen it 3 or 4 times and still can't quite figure it out . Sure some of the scenes make perfect sense , and then there are those that make you say , huh ? If you watch this movie try seeing it uncut as the ending at least makes sense . I first watched it on the sci-fi channel and it just ended and I was left to wonder what the heck happened to Sean Connery's and the lady's characters . Suffice to say if you see it uncut it shows you and even if a bit depressing you at least find out . Though I am still not quite sure when Connery and the lady fell in love . This movie revolves around an outlaw I would call him coming into this dome world full of immortals . This immortals used Connery and others on the outside to do crops and stuff and to kill . They catch Connery and study him . . . meaning eventually kill him , but they never get round to it . There is a lot more to the plot , but it is hard to explain so I will leave it at that . Let's just say Connery's character disrupts these immortals way of life . The thing with the crystal and stuff will confuse you though . There is also a good deal of nudity in this one , but these ladies are a bit , um how would you say ? Flat chested so there really isn't anything to exciting there . All in all a sort of good movie . . . I think ?
548267	1111192	120912	6.0	I think the makers of the film thought we had somewhere to go .	This movie is the sequel of course to the hit movie " Men In Black " . I gave this movie a six , but I felt like being generous ( I probably should give it a five ) . This movie is short . I mean really , really short . There is a short that preceded the movie so that tells you how short this movie is ( the short got more laughs than the movie I think ) . I went to this movie knowing how short it was , but it just went by so fast and the movie was a bit unmemorable that it was a waste of time to drive to the theater . There was no time for character development or much story development . In fact , the opening credit scene itself took four or five minutes . The story has Smith's character trying to get the memory back of Jones character to battle an alien threat . For the most part there isn't much that is funny in this one , but there are a few scenes to make a person chuckle . Then there is the pug dog . I think it had the same screen time as Tommy Lee Jones . It was funny in small doses , but its role was expanded way too much for the sequel . Johnny Knoxville's character was lame as was the main villain , which had looks but no funny dialogue at all . Tony Shaloub is back , and once again his character's role is small and underused . So all in all this is an inferior sequel by all means with just enough to look at to keep you from getting bored . If they ever make a part three , please let them get a director who is capable of making a movie .
548820	1111192	425430	6.0	This horror movie is filled with clichés to say the least .	Yes , this film is not original it borrows heavily from other films such as " The Grudge " , " The Amityville Horror " , and even " Mortuary " to name just a few , but it still entertained me for the most part as at least it was short and fast moving , granted you don't need a degree in criminal justice to see the ending coming a mile away . I will say " Don't look at the back of the DVD " ! ! before seeing it as that will in fact totally ruin the movie . This movie has a family uprooting Chicago and moving to North Dakota to start a sun flower farm which is about the only original thing about this film ( the sunflower part , the uprooting has been done to death ) . Of course , here come the clichés , the cell phone with no reception , the recurring stain , the " has there ever been anything strange that happened at that house " question , the people not believing the person trying to warn of danger , and even a creepy kid . Yes , they are all here to guide us along our story with a few supernatural happenings and Jake the Snake Robarts makes an appearance too as a dude looking for work ( I know it isn't him , but it sure did look like him ) . So we get crow attacks , this and that , the ending is a bit to happy , but then at least it went by fast .
548801	1111192	103874	6.0	Needs more horror .	Yes this look at Dracula is definitely more romance than horror as there is really nothing that is all that scary in it . Not that it is entirely bad . . . in fact I would say I found it an ok movie , just needed more horror . The story is of course about Dracula . . . Keanu Reeves character goes to work for him after his previous employee Renfield went insane . Dracula sees a picture of Reeves fiancé ( Ryder ) and since she looks like someone he used to be in love with he goes after her leaving Reeves a prisoner in the castle . Dracula makes it to where Ryder is and attempts to win her over . Meanwhile , Reeves makes his escape . Hopkins playing Van Helsing comes involved , as Dracula has been sucking on Ryder's friend Lucy so she is a bit ill and Helsing is some expert . All in all not a bad film just needed a little more work in the horror department .
548646	1111192	433386	7.0	Basically more of the same , but I liked it a bit .	Of course the reason I may like this one is all the girls in the locker room shower scene , but hey that is a reason to like a movie . No seriously I thought it was okay . Though absolutely nothing you have not seen before . . . just think the first Grudge only with a bizarre Chicago family storyline that comes together at the end . Not that it wasn't thoroughly predictable . Okay , sounds like I didn't care for this movie much , but I found it a fun way to pass time . It wasn't boring as it had a kill every so often to keep the story going . The story you ask ? Well there really isn't much of one , I hated it when they tried to add a reason behind the haunting , I thought that just cheapened the whole affair and I was glad to see it was short lived . The ending was nothing new and about the same , like I said it was not a boring movie thanks to the kills , however it was only mildly scary here and there and it just seemed to Americanized this time too . Sure all the Japanese horror remakes are a bit , but this one was more so . This one was better than the American Ring 2 as I found that one really boring , but this one is not nearly as good as its Japanese counterpart JuOn 2 as that one has a hospital scene that has to be seen to believe . Then again this one had that girl shower scene in it .
548810	1111192	87928	7.0	A rather good start for a whole lot of sequels .	Yes , these Police Academy movies would become rather weak , but I thought they started out rather good with this one and part two . This one in the series is also the most risqué , as this film series would actually become more of a family type comedy series when this one is an R rated one that has nudity and one rather funny speech scene . It kind of did the opposite of the Meatballs franchise that went from family friendly to more adult oriented . The gist of the story is simple , a lot of people who should not be in a police academy enroll in one and each is a misfit type in his or her own way . Granted I do not seem them enrolling someone like Mahoney as they kind of frown upon people with troubled pasts becoming police officers . You have your gun toting security guard who always wanted to be a cop , your giant strong dude becoming a cop and a womanizer along with a host of others . The comedy is good and for the most part it works . I enjoyed the two idiots who shaved their heads bald in the one scene and when they got caught up in the bar . Lots of funny stuff , unfortunately the sequels would mainly just repeat what was in this one and the next film and the jokes would become rather stale as the series went through six sequels I know of .
548956	1111192	91223	7.0	Good chills and laughs	This is one of my favorite haunted house stories and comedy horrors . The characters are likeable and so is the story . The plot follows William Katt as he encounters many strange things in his old aunts home . His kid has been missing for some time and he is seperated from his wife . He has an annoying neighbor played by George Wendt who does an excellent job . What is behind all the weird stuff going on in the house , well I won't give it away , but just watch the flashback scenes and you will figure it out . Especially the last one that he actually acts out .
548370	1111192	91541	7.0	Most of the movie is a laugh , but some of it is the pits .	This movie follows the misadventures of a couple who is in desperate need of a place to stay and end up getting tricked into buying a house well out of their price range that is in the need of a few repairs . Hanks and Long are pretty good and the jokes are really funny , but it is just one of those comedies that has a few scenes that aren't that funny and drag the movie down a notch . For the most part the ending is not the strong point and most of the better jokes are in the beginning and the middle of this one . The funniest stuff coming as they enter their new home and the stairs seem to creak a bit , the electricity seems a tad off , and there are minor problems with the plumbing as well . Throw in also a road warrior type demolition crew , and a permit guy who is a tad on the insecure side . I didn't care for the whole did she have an affair thing in the plot as it seemed it was added to pad the film , but for the most part this movie had its moments and is worth a viewing .
549035	1111192	1014679	7.0	A game in serious need of a retry mission option .	Yes , the characters were they're usually selves which was great . The fighting aspect of the game was okay . On some points though it needed lots of work . For one some of the missions in this game were to damn hard . I don't want to pull my hair out on a game , I am looking to pass time , not have a heart attack . Yet for most of the missions you had to turn off the machine if you failed because they did not give you the option to retry it . Trust me you will give up on those prison escort missions if you have to do them a couple of times and have to put up with all the dialog again . The character part also had a flaw too . It let you team up with other characters , but you could only do it for a short time before going to Naruto again and I wanted to use these characters more . I would have rather had the Marvel Ultimate Alliance format . The story though was good and I loved the interaction of Naruto and everybody as it was just like the show . I would have preferred cel shaded graphics , but the graphics are okay . So in the end an okay game that would have been better had they not made some of the missions so hard and had better teaming up . It also would have been better if it involved a more free roaming environment to explore like in Naruto : Rise of the Ninja for the xbox 360 .
548451	1111192	87469	7.0	Good , but doesn't have the fast flow of Raiders .	This was a pretty good movie , but unlike its predecessor it doesn't have the fast flow to it . Raiders goes by quick , while this one has boring parts . All the action in this one takes place in the beginning or the end with not much in the middle , but a few scenes to chuckle at . It starts great with a nightclub fight and a great plane crash sequence . Here Indiana meets Kate Capshaw's character . They end up in India I think along with Indiana's sidekick . They run into a village and go to some fort or castle where a kid is king to get this stone that was stolen from the village . There they encounter a strange cult that sacrifices people into some lava pit and the head guy there can pull people's heart out . They also use the village's children as slaves in the mine there . This leads to mine car chases and a very good battle on a bridge . All in all though this one just seems to run a bit to long , as it doesn't have as good of pacing as " Raiders of the Lost Ark " did .
548651	1111192	113409	7.0	One weird movie . . . but still pretty good .	This film was very strange , but I really enjoyed it . It starts out ( and I haven't seen it in a while so I may be wrong ) with a guy at lunch or something and he has to track down some author . Another guy with an ax tries to kill the guy that has to track down the author . Well anyhow my favorite stuff just about exclusively happens in the town . All this weird stuff happens . . . things the author has written about . It kind of tails off once they leave town , but the ending is kind of disturbing .
549073	1111192	362120	7.0	About what I expected .	It was rather funny , as to be expected the jokes were hit and miss with there being more hits than misses for me . I thought once again it could have been funnier and there were some unnecessary jokes , but all in all it was a rather funny flick . This one actually plays like a sequel as characters from the previous flick are explained why they aren't here rather than just being ignored all together . For this one the required viewing or basic knowledge of a movie that you need for this one is mainly " Saw " , " The Grudge " , " The Village " , " Million Dollar Baby " , and for me the best one " War of the Worlds " ( a movie that needed some fun poked at it ) . There is also something in there making a bit of fun of a movie pretty much you don't need to have seen are know all that much about . . . you will get it as long as you watch a bit of television . The " War of the Worlds " to me seems to be the main film parodied , however the other films get their fair share of the jokes as well . The opening is rather funny with Shaq and Dr . Phil doing a " Saw " recreation and there are other celebrities who make short visits as well however it is still the same group who forms the core of the cast . Worth a look see , however , if you did not care for " Scary Movie 3 " I would say you probably won't like this one .
548438	1111192	1024953	7.0	Not an entirely satisfying experience I was expecting more considering it was made by the same team as Chrono Trigger .	This game is a rather good rpg for the xbox 360 , a system that is not exactly heavy on this genre . Then again , what does one expect considering rpg's are more popular in Japan and the xbox 360 is an American video game system . Made by those responsible for the innovative Chrono Trigger , this game boasts great graphics , a pretty good storyline , and a likable group of characters . It is , however , not all that innovative . A standard rpg for the most part , which would usually be fine with me except for two flaws . One , the character's attacks come in the form of shadow creatures that stand behind our character's . While our character's have unique personalities and are full of life during cut scenes and such , during battle they might as well all do the same thing , because they all can do the same things if you wished and they all wear the same armor . There is just not enough uniqueness about them in combat . The only thing they do different is a special attack not acquired till nearly the end of the game . They also do the same battle dance wrap up every time as well . Second , the fighting tends to be a bit annoying at times . No random battles , but at times there are so many enemies present you would prefer it . You may be able to flee one , but another will get you . Near the end this was especially annoying as I just wanted to win the game and they kept flinging enemies in my path . By this point I was slaughtering them , but the fights here still take a long time even if you are super strong . Still , it was a fun little game . . . the story , a boy named Shu and his friend's Jiro and Kluke hatch a plan to stop a creature known as the land shark from terrorizing their village . They end up on board a huge ship in the sky where they meet the evil Nene and are imbued by a strange power that allows their shadows to take the form of massive beasts that fight for them . They are later joined by two others as they journey to stop Nene from his rather bizarre plans . A couple of surprises near the end too . The music is sometimes just okay , but then at other times it really stands out . The voice work is good too , though the one character was a bit annoying at times , and if you have played it you know which one . A few tweaks here and there and this good game could have been great , but I still prefer " Enchanted Arms " to this one as I liked the fighting better there and while I prefer story to fighting in an rgp when you do have to fight as much as you did in this one it can detract from the game . Also , the final boss is a pain . . . just make sure you save as instructed by the game , otherwise there is a possibility of having to start entirely over . Thankfully , I pulled out a win and got lucky .
549182	1111192	242653	7.0	More enjoyable than Reloaded , but still not the original .	Let me start off by saying I didn't like Reloaded all that much . In fact , other than a couple of scenes I didn't like it much at all . This one , however , I found to be very enjoyable . I was looking for a couple of hours of diversion and I got it . This one picks up where the last left off ; thank goodness there was no recap . Neo is in a comatose state and the machines are close to Zion . What ensues after a somewhat slow start is a great battle and one heck of a finishing fight . Not as many speeches in this one , and thank God there was no rave scene or anything like that in this one . Morpheus kind of takes a back seat in this one and that helps as he has less time to make dramatic speeches , actually Neo isn't in a lot of this one either . Still it works cause the battle between the squid robots and the people is really cool . The humans use these cool machines that are reminiscent of the loaders in the movie " Aliens " except they have guns . Agent Smith is also back and he is close to taking over not only the matrix , but also all of the machines . This sets up an incredible fight that reminds me of a fight in the anime DragonBall Z . In fact this movie makes me excited about that movie , cause I can see they can do fighting right in that one . It also makes me excited about Spiderman 2 as those tentacles on the squid robot look like his arms would . And those machines the humans were using make me look forward to the Transformers live action movie . Are all the questions answered ? No , but some of those questions should have never been brought up in Reloaded to begin with cause they were only used to try to make it seem more complicated than it was . This movie was simply more of an action movie , which is probably why it turned some off , but I liked it . I gave Reloaded a 4 , but I give this one a 7 , it is not without its flaws , but overall this one did not disappoint me .
548173	1111192	89886	8.0	You are not supposed to like the super smart kids , but these guys are rather cool .	This is a funny comedy movie from the 80's that just works thanks mainly to the spot on cast . Granted , Val Kilmer kind of steals the show . The movie has a simple enough plot to begin with and through the course of the movie gets bigger and bigger till it " pops " . A very intelligent kid is coming on board at a school for very smart guys , can not remember if it is a college or just an advanced high school . He is a bit out of place , however , he is going to get to meet this legend . Unfortunately , this legend is not at all what he expects clowning around and such and being a rather fun guy . Granted he has a very good reason for this later in the movie . The movie has great scenes where the smart kids make it so dry ice is formed in the halls of the dorm and at one point they have a pool party . They are all in the end working on this laser project which is the central plot point in the film and what makes the plot go from just your typical school type movie to something a bit more . It ends on a very funny note and great ending scene too . So all in all a funny movie with likable characters , I prefer this " nerds " to the ones in " Revenge of the Nerds " . Also , the first time I heard the very good Tears for Fears song " Everybody wants to rule the World " .
548329	1111192	118583	8.0	Not as good as the first two Alien movies , but it is the easiest to watch .	I enjoyed this , the fourth movie of the Alien saga . As good as the first two , no , but at least it was a lot better than part three which I did not really care much for at all . This is also the fastest paced and more humorous of the four movies and that only adds to the appeal . You never get as tense as you did watching the first two , but that can be a good thing if you just want to watch the aliens killing and being killed rather than watching something that makes your heart race . Weaver is back as a clone of her former self , and quite frankly she seems to be having a lot more fun in this one than in the others . Ryder and Pearlman make great additions and really add the overall effect of this film . The aliens are once again reborn and they take over a ship as of you expect to happen . No one ever listens when they are told that the aliens can not be controlled . A group of mercenaries join forces with Weaver to fight their way to freedom off the alien infested ship . Good movie , though there is a few bizarre scenes here and there including one with Weaver and an alien . This one is not the best of the series , but it is a fun movie to watch .
548388	1111192	365376	8.0	Very interesting Asian horror , worth a couple of looks .	This was a very interesting and creepy movie from Korea . . . good story , beautiful visually , and great music too . Perfect , no it had a flaw or two , overall though I thought it was a very good Asian horror movie . The tale has these two sisters coming home from what was apparently a stay at a hospital . Upon their arrival they are greeted warmly at first by their stepmother . However , as things move along the stepmother seems to grow more and more hostile to the two sisters , especially the younger one who is more quiet and reserved unlike the older sibling who seems able to take up for herself . That is about all I am going to say though as I don't want to give it away , I was somewhat confused on first viewing , but after going to the message boards here and re-watching the movie I pretty much get it now with the exception of the flaws I mentioned . The flaws are probably the scariest bits in the film , but they seem to serve no other purpose to the story except to scare . There are three scenes like this in the flick . . . the dream sequence with the black figure ghost ( I know who she is , but not the point of the dream ) , the dinner scene with the woman going into fits and the apparition under the sink , and the scene near the end involving the step mum . Like I said , these scenes just did not seem to fit in , and seem like they were added just for cheap scares , but if anyone can explain them in context to the story feel free to private message me . The rest of the film is great though and the ending was a surprise for me .
548571	1111192	208156	8.0	Eighth installment not perfect , but still really good .	This Final Fantasy for the most part is good . It has its low points mind you such as the lack of a really defined villain , a fighting engine your when you level up you only get a little stronger but the enemies level up and get really stronger , and the fact all the characters are about the same age and are all basically regular looking teenagers . Still , when this game first came out I was just starting college and the fact this FF features the use of an academy made it a lot of fun . The fighting is rather good , here though you basically must make use of beings called Guardian something or another and they are basically summons you equip to characters and when equipped they can increase strength , health and do a whole host of other things . You can gain more power by drawing different magic from enemies and a couple of other ways as well . In the end for this one I basically don't use magic at all and don't fight and kill all that many enemies if I can help it . Which makes this FF unique if not a tad frustrating at times . Still the story of a group of students doing various jobs as mercenaries is rather good . The graphics are a bit better than seven as the characters look a lot better . Towns , however , in this one are kind of pointless , I have never played another FF where towns were less interesting than this one , and there are a host of other problems too . Still , I liked the story for the most part especially the scenes where you travel as this other mercenary from the past and the ending is actually a bit better than seven's too .
548920	1111192	483607	8.0	Basically Escape from New York and Mad Max combined . . . which is a good thing .	Seriously , this movie rather surprised me in how much bloody action there was . I was just desperate to see a movie , and my parents told me they saw previews of this movie and I thought I would give it a go . In fact , I have never known less about a movie before seeing it than this one . So imagine my surprise when I got a very kick ass movie . Virtually non stop action that was really bloody . It was also one hell of a ride . The story , years earlier a disease known as the reaper virus takes out the north section of England and it is walled up , its citizens left to die . Years pass and London and the rest of England is not in very good shape . Overcrowding , financial turmoil and crime runs rampant . Add to this , the fact the reaper virus has appeared once again . What can be done you ask ? Well it seems that the reaper virus did not kill everyone in the infected zone , one of whom was a doctor working on a cure . Enter a special agent girl who has ties and a few other soldiers and they are off to this area walled off so many years ago in search of this doctor and possibly a cure . What they find is that the citizens left have become a bit like savages and they are going through their own civil war . Lots of gun fights and chases ensue . We even have our gal fighting a knight as some of the people look like they are from the road warrior the others like they are from king Arthur's court . It ends with one rather cool car chase . However , it isn't perfect as there are a few to many flaws here and there such as a car that rams through a bus and remains almost untouched . It does overcome these few faults to make one enjoyable movie that even has a star or two that one would recognize .
548836	1111192	72271	8.0	Better than I thought it would be .	I kept hearing people talking about this one . Either it was really good , or really bad . I found it to be a pretty good horror flick . Not too much gore as one might expect by the title , but all in all it didn't disappoint . A group of teens are driving through Texas ( I don't know why the plot outline says they are hippies ) so a brother and sister can make sure a grave of a relative is undisturbed . Apparently , a lot of bodies have been dug up in the cemetery and some of the bodies have even been put in crude poses . The brother is confined to a wheelchair . . . also along for the drive is the sister's boyfriend and another young couple . After the cemetery they drive along and see a hitchhiker and decide to pick him up . This would be mistake number one for these rather stupid teens , but hey they are teens so it is realistic that they would be incredibly dumb . The hitchhiker seems friendly enough at first , but later goes crazy so they dump him and continue on . They then hit a gas station , but there is no gas . Despite the attendant there basically telling them they would be better off not going to any houses in the area because of the people in the area , the teens do anyway as they go to a house that used to belong to the brother and sister's grandfather . Once there the couple goes for a swim , but there is no water in the swimming hole , so they go to the neighbors who might have gas and also have a bunch of cars underneath camouflage . This would tip off most of us to get the heck out , but no the teens proceed to walk right in the house and get killed by Leatherface . One complaint about this movie is that I think the killings could have been spaced out a bit more , but overall it was a rather good flick . Though it is pretty sad to watch the teens basically walk right into Leatherface's house and get whacked off . Only the blond caused him any trouble . I also wasn't thrilled when Leather face the gruesome killer didn't even seem to be the head of his strange family , but I can overlook that . This one almost plays out like a snuff film at times , and it is hard to see in some areas , but this just enhances the mood in the movie . All in all a good movie and a lot , lot , lot better than the only other Texas I have seen . . . part 4 .
548328	1111192	106639	8.0	I like it quite a bit . . . a lot more than the first Cyborg .	I was just looking at the 100 bottom movies according to IMDb users seeing if there was anything to review that I haven't yet and I found this little screen gem . One of those occasions when you see a movie ranked as one of the worst and you just have to be one of the few that actually likes it . Darn , well I guess I will get ridiculed and spat upon here , but for me this was a pretty good flick when I saw it . It has been awhile however , I remember it used to come on HBO late at night and I watched it two or three times and I haven't seen it really since and I would love to watch it again now knowing Jolie was in it . The story follows a cyborg and a guy trying to escape the clutches of this corporation and some bounty hunters after them . I think that is basically all there is to it , throw in a few scenes with Jack Palance and we have our movie . Some good action here and there , and some blood and violence as well . There is also a love story at play as well as the female cyborg and the guy who trained her to fight kind of fall in love with each other . The dialog sometimes becomes rather bad at times and it is by far not a top notch film , but for a b-movie it is really good . I don't know if it was a theatrical release though because it does not seem high quality enough for that , but it does make for one of the better direct to videos if it was one of those .
548823	1111192	449088	8.0	Jack Sparrow returns , though not nearly enough for my tastes .	On par with Dead Man's Chest , not as good as the first part three still offers a very wild ride . The main problem , I have never had a harder time trying to keep up with so many double crosses and under the table deals as I did in this movie . Everyone had a hidden motive it seemed even Will Turner who in the last movie was just a trusting dupe . I can not believe no one seems to have the problems with this story as they did with Spidey 3 which I found very easy to follow . Add to that the fact that Captain Jack Sparrow , the sole character who made this series is not in it much and you have the disappointment of part two all over again . Granted it was not a huge disappointment , it was a good movie and it was great seeing Geoffrey Rusch back as Barbossa so it did get points for that . The story , this is going to be the hard part , however , I am keeping it as simple as possible . The gang is going in search for Jack , all with differing reasons . Jack is banished to Davey Jones locker and is going a bit crazy . There is a rescue and now there is a pirate meeting to attend , something about a song , a vengeful sea spirit named Calypso and various other obstacles leading to what I have to say is one heck of an action packed conclusion that is packed with great special effects . So there you have it , sure it could use a trimming of the run time as it goes on a while , but it still manages to entertain . I would have liked to see a simpler story though with a bit more comedy as there are some chuckle scenes , just nothing all that super funny like in the first . It was also surprising to see the villain from the last movie Davey Jones play basically a very small role till the very end during the uber action scene . Characters seemingly not all that important in the last film are now somewhat the focal point and you see Keith Richards in a small role as well . So as you can see there is a bit much going on and if there were a sequel to be made I say no Will or Elizabeth , bring back Barbossa , and have Jack Sparrow in it more and keep the plot more lighthearted and simple .
548424	1111192	397040	8.0	Not beyond good , but good nonetheless .	The critics loved this game and so I thought I would buy it . In the end it was a rather good and original game . The only two problems I have with it is the fact it is too short and the ending is a bit lacking . The rest of the game is rather fun though and rather easy to pick up and varies as well . You control Jade , a gal who watches over these orphans at a lighthouse . Why are they orphans , well an alien race has come to this particular planet full of all sorts of weird aliens and is causing havoc by abducting its citizens and such . A military group is on the planet to protect it , but they seem to have issues as well . Well you must guide Jade through this planet searching for the truth and you even become a sort of photographer for a group committed to exposing the truth . So this for me was the best portion of the game as you must sneak in these facilities and take pictures . You are also awarded for taking pictures of the various alien life forms on the planet . You do some fighting , and it is rather easy to perform , but stealth also plays a key role in the game . You will also use a hovercraft to reach areas and win races and a spaceship late in the game . So there a various things to do . Still though it wraps up way to soon , and the ending doesn't really overwhelm . Still though , it is different from all the sequels and such that come massive waves .
548763	1111192	93870	8.0	Over the top violence and lots of bullets even gore . . . of course I thought it was good .	Yes , the guy who did this movie would later make Starship Troopers , here though I think is a more realistic take on a future society . A rather violent society , a place where the average cop just is not enough so they try to make a super cop . First , they try a totally robotic one with very deadly yet somehow darkly comic results . Since this one fails another person gets to try it his way and they make this robotic cop using the remains of an officer who is simply gunned down in a most brutal and unpleasant way . So the officer goes out on his beat and takes out criminals very effectively albeit a bit emotionless . His former partner though jogs his memory and all hell breaks loose at a factory where we have a very cool fight that even involves a dude getting toxic waste on himself . Then you have a conclusion that while not as great as the factory fight is still rather cool and a bit funny as well . So there you have it , Peter Weller does a rather good job as Robocop , Nancy Allen is okay too , but nothing special . Good villains too , but I can not really say if I remember seeing them in other movies other than Ronny Cox as if has been awhile since I have seen this movie . Though as a kid I thought this movie was the bomb as I saw it at the theater . Did not care for the fake commercials in it though .
548778	1111192	98412	8.0	Rather good vampire flick .	It has its bad points , but for the most part I liked this title , which is more of a comedy than a horror . Bruce Campbell as Van Helsing is pretty funny to watch in this one and the rest of the cast does a good job as well . The tale is about an all vampire town that is tired of killing so they actually have been able to create a synthetic blood with the help of this one guy who doesn't know they are vampires . Something goes wrong with the machine so the guy who made it comes to town to fix it . . . unfortunately the town has malcontents who want to go back to the day of drinking real blood rather than the fact stuff . Van Helsing also arrives in town looking for Count Dracula who doesn't apparently live in the town . Like I said more comedy and action than horror . There are some flaws in the movie , but most of them have to do with the plot . Like why would these two teenagers join the vampires when one killed their friend ? There are a couple of other points like this , but it is best to just sit back and enjoy the show .
549135	1111192	164181	8.0	Caught this one on tv and found it was rather good .	Some had told me this one was actually better than the " Sixth Sense " and I found this to be true ( they get compared because they were released about the same time ) . The plot has a guy hypnotized at a party . He wakes up from the trance finding that he was very receptive to hypnotic suggestion . He even learns that the gal who hypnotized him stuck a pin through his hand ( if someone did that to me , I would be ticked ) . He also now is very thirsty and he seems to be able to receive messages from beyond the grave . His son also has this talent . A very good suspense that has more of a plot than " Sixth Sense " did and it moves much better . You should be able to figure out the mystery though fairly easily , but that does not diminish how good this film is . Kevin Bacon is great in the lead role and all in all this was a very entertaining flick .
548826	1111192	463854	8.0	28 weeks later a frenetic nonstop horror thrill ride .	I first have to admit I did not much care for 28 days later , however , part of my dislike for that movie may stem from the fact a review I read said it was like " Dawn of the Dead " which it wasn't really . Still , I may not be as harsh on it now as I was when I first saw it , I found it was a bit slow at times and you really never got to see the best horror , only have it described to you by the one person talking about how people were in a panic and that one by one people turned . Here you get to see exactly that . The movie starts with a bang as a husband flees from the rage infected hordes of people having left his wife behind seemingly to die , flash to 28 weeks later and the city is being repopulated slowly , but surely as the husband from the beginning is reunited with his kids who are extremely stupid . Yes , they do what they are not supposed to and go into a non safe area in search of their old house so they can pick up a few mementos of their mum . Well surprise , surprise their mother is alive , though not so well and is taken back to the city for examination . Well we soon find out why you should stay in the safe zone as the infection begins again and I am pretty sure most of the people who have returned home are now thinking maybe we should not have returned . The infection spreads as fast as described in the first movie , there is panic in the streets and the military is now in kill mode as our two kids are joined by a medical officer and a military man not keen on shooting everyone in sight whether infected or not . So you have cool chases with both the infected and the military and the characters in this one don't have much time to do anything , but catch their breath . Very good and fast paced horror movie .
548757	1111192	417183	8.0	A rarity in and of itself , a really good rpg on the gamecube .	Other than the Baten Kaitos series , this is about the only really good rpg on the gamecube system . Well Skies of Arcadia was good as well , but it was not originally designed for gamecube . This game features a group of friends and fighters helping another one of their friends complete a pilgrimage that once complete will lead her to becoming an angel and lead the world in which they live in out of a down period and into a new age of prosperity . Sounds a bit like Final Fantasy X , eh ? Well it does follow the usual rpg formula for the most part as there are a couple of twists here and there , though nothing to shocking what makes this one fun are the characters and the comedy that this and all the Tales series have within them . They also share the same combat system , a real time super fast battle , while it may be fun makes me at least tend to use only one of the characters all the time rather than switching around to others . You just get used to their moves and you have a hard time switching and assigning moves and such . So for an epic journey that spans two worlds and is a lot of fun , though not the most original , this game is worth checking out .
548944	1111192	109916	8.0	I like this one .	Here Godzilla is challenged by a space version of him . He also has these guys on an island trying to study him , and one of them wants him dead , cause he believes Godzilla is responsible for his friend's death . The government has also made this robot to fight Godzilla . All in all Godzilla has a pretty rough time of it facing the two . Though the team controlling the robot eventually joins forces with Godzilla to attack the space monster . I like this one , there are a lot of fights and Space Godzilla looks pretty cool , when he isn't flying around in space . Though I am thinking seeing Godzilla vs . MechaGodzilla would help a person understand it a bit more . As I am thinking the guy whose friend died was shown in that one .
548316	1111192	488536	8.0	For those who figured why not just blow the little girl in " The Ring " away with a shotgun .	I am not the biggest shooter fan in the world . Normally , if I do play a shooter there has to be some sort of twist for it to be fun for me . In this one you have a supernatural presence throughout the game that appears here and there , usually in interludes between chapters . The story , a special missions force is sent to capture the leader of a mysterious army , an army that does whatever the leader says , a sort of clone army . Well there is more than there seems , as this little girl starts appearing here and there and really causing havoc . You spend the game trying to learn her secret and the connection between her and the military commander and even yourself . As far as shooters this one is pretty cool , I loved the shotgun weapon the best as everything else ran out of ammo a bit fast . The fighting is fast , and it is rather hard to be stealthy as the enemy soldiers lock on you rather quickly . Still , you get your shots in . . . there is a lot of tension too as you never know what will be thrown your way next . A few enemies are a pain even on easy level , but for the most part it was not that hard navigating through this game to the somewhat bizarre ending .
549122	1111192	300471	8.0	Good follow up to Shanghai Noon .	Shanghai Noon was a pretty good flick and so is this one . . . it is a bit better than Noon . Owen Wilson and Jackie Chan seem to have more chemistry this time and the humor is better . The action is always solid , but it is mainly Chan doing all the fighting here with Wilson kinda just hanging back . The story is Chan's father is killed and the killers go to England and Chan , Wilson head to England to find the killers and get this royal crest back . . . also Chan has a sister to whom Wilson's character is attracted . Nothing ground breaking , but it is still a good buddy flick and worth checking out .
548486	1111192	317919	8.0	My favorite in the series . . . I think .	I liked this movie quite a lot and I think it is my favorite . Why do I say think ? Because the first two were fun to watch , but were not what you would call memorable movies . This one may not be either so I had better review it now lest I forget it and just say it was entertaining , but I don't remember much about it . This one has Ethan Hunt being tortured with his wife about to be killed before him right at the get go . It then shifts to an early time and this was a very nice plot device because I was actually curious to see how he got into that predicament and how he would get out of it . There is a rather cool rescue scene and another where our team must try to capture a weapons dealer . There is one good action scene after another quite frankly and this time Ethan Hunt has a good IMF team behind him and they actually seem to be helpful . This one also has a very good bad guy a few twists along the way ( though nothing to hard to figure out ) and it has a rather interesting part of the movie where Hunt is getting something for the bad guy but you never get to see any of it except before he enters the building and when he abruptly leaves said building . This movie is not without its flaws , however , to me it was the best one of the series and one heck of an action movie . . . at least I think I liked it more than the other two .
548307	1111192	271367	8.0	Surprisingly good .	I found this for sale and I thought I would check it out . I wasn't expecting much , but it turns out I liked this movie . This is a tale of spiders that mutated from some chemicals and grow to giant size and attack . Simple enough . The effects were good and the actors were rather good themselves . Arquette was good too , and that was somewhat surprising . There were three or four different types of spiders on the rampage so you got to see them kill in different ways . The comedy was pretty good too , as this one doesn't take itself to seriously . I agree with those who said it was like a 50's sci-fi flick and it is definitely worth a look .
548977	1111192	207488	8.0	Not quite as good as six , but almost .	It took me nine years to finally play through and win this Final Fantasy game . That right there should tell you this one is a bit different . The story is your standard Final Fantasy fare . A traveler , a princess , a pirate , and a mysterious man with amnesia go on a quest to try and stop the destruction of the elemental crystals : Earth , wind , fire and water . They are also searching for the father of the princess . In the end an evil entity named X-Death is set free and he has plans to capture a terrifying power that threatens not one , but two worlds ! What sets this one apart and causes it to be sort of a pain too is the job system . Similar to that found in Final Fantasy X-2 , but more involved you switch between classes , gain their powers and in the end decide what powers will help you totally tear X-Death apart . The jobs though can take awhile to build up , now that I have a very good sized music collection it is not so bad , but it gets rather boring just leveling up with the same old music playing . The final boss in this one was somewhat tough too , until I read a strategy on beating him , then adding a few of my own touches it was a breeze . So in the end I liked six a bit better , however , this one was a rather good entry into the final fantasy universe . I think it is also the first one to feature Moogles , however , I may be wrong on that point . You also have a wide array of vehicles in this one to use to , from chocobos to airships , and even a submarine . However , the story is a bit short , I won it in thirty hours and I spent a good ten or more of that leveling .
548282	1111192	70917	8.0	Not much of a horror , but good .	This movie has been recommended to me by several people so I bought it . It turned out to be a pretty decent movie , but I wouldn't call it a horror flick . Great cast and acting make this mystery go which it is more of a mystery type flick . Of course at one point I was worried it was going to be some sort of musical , but after a stint where there are quite a few songs in a row they taper off . Of course the one song with Britt Ekland was rather good . . . heh heh . Christopher Lee is great in this one as well . It basically follows a cop from england trying to find a missing girl on an island full of pagans . In the end I really felt sorry for the one character .
548223	1111192	1104836	8.0	Well they did not really keep us hanging between two and three now did they ?	Yes , just a few short months after Feast II , here comes the happy finish to the trilogy . And while this one is not as good as the first one , it is a bit better than two . The focus of this one is comedy more than horror , though there is plenty of gore and once again boobs to keep me entertained , but then I am a pervert who likes a good gory movie . The story has our group of survivors right where they were after the last movie and like the last movie they have to do a lot of stuff to try and survive . They have no need to fear though as a butt kicking gun touting hero , a prophet , and a martial arts master come to the aid of our tired and beat down gang . They have to go through many obstacles on their way to finding a way past the deadly creatures that feast upon human flesh . From the rooftop where we left them , to the sheriff's office , and to a drainage pipe . You will get to see one person tired of the abuse get out of the film fairly quickly , lots of deaths , the use of gunpowder to stop the bleeding , and an ending that made me go " what " ? It is far from perfect as the tunnel scenes were a bit dark and they used night vision camera's a bit to much . Still the cast is still funny in a strange way and I like the way it follows the first movies format of introducing the characters and the previous movies combined . It is nice in this entire series that the monsters are a combination of costume and makeup rather than the computer generated monsters of the science fiction channel too . I don't understand why the score is so low here on the same level with the abysmal " Automaton Transfusion " as that piece of crap had no sort of ending whatsoever and the effects were not good even for a low budget movie . Though people here probably took pity upon it because it was a beginner film maker who made it .
548957	1111192	94995	8.0	Fast paced anime action at its best .	This is one of my favorite anime movies I have seen . It is very fast paced with really cool action scenes , likable characters dubbed good , and good villains as well . Only one dude can save the world from the demons . . . his father tried to previously , but failed . This is shown right at the beginning and sets the tone for the rest of this flick . Let's just say that there aren't many boring parts to speak of . My favorite character had to be Mephisto . You wonder if he is on the side of good , or perhaps evil . Through it all the dude fights his way through the demons till he has the final confrontation with the man responsible for his dad's death . The final conflict is one for the ages and the ending to this one won't leave you saying " what just happened ? " .
548470	1111192	186350	8.0	One of the must have games if you had the Nintendo game console .	Yes , this game looks very simple in its make up , but it was indeed a very fun game . You are Samus , a bounty hunter on a planet of pirates trying to prevent them from using a creature known as a Metroid as a weapon . The goal of the game is to defeat the leader of the pirates known as mother brain and stop the scourge of Metroids from taking over the universe . The first step to accomplish this task is to collect weapons and abilities to help you get stronger . There are many weapons to get to as you have your missiles , freeze beam , bombs and other assorted jumping abilities and things . You also collect energy tanks so you can withstand more damage from the enemies . The next step is to rid the planet of two of the mother brains main henchmen . Kragen and Ridely . . . one a giant porcupine type beasty and the other a bird . Tracking down Kragen is fairly simple , but man he was one tough opponent . He is listed as the first boss , but I can usually easily kill Ridley rather than this one . Though Ridley is harder to find . The final step is to infiltrate the mother brain's main chambers and fight your way through a horde of Metroid , which are not all that tough considering they are the title character and on to a not so tough battle with the mother brain . Lots of monsters to fight as I still remember the instruction book to this one being rather good with pictures of the monster and a good story set up . The play is rather simple , the music simple yet effective as all around this game is rather good fun for the early days of video game consoles .
549053	1111192	859163	8.0	Really like the other mummy movies except for the setting .	Well the setting and the fact Rachel Weiz was replaced . Still , I thought it was a good movie for what it was . Basically , the mindless popcorn flick of the summer where you really have to turn off your brain to have a good time . Though seeing the score here I have to think I am in the minority as far as people liking this one . I compare it to Van Helsing a bit . . . short on plot , but makes up for it with a lot of action . It passed the time nicely for me . The story , well another mummy has been reawakened . This time in China , a legendary emperor played by Jet Li . Well the mummy is discovered by Brendan Fraser character's son and the O'Conells who were apparently spies or something between mummy movies are sent to China with a rare artifact and of course their on a collision course for adventure and action . Granted , the plot is not all that great , but then when is it ever in these mummy movies ? Great initial chase scene , some good action in the mountains and a nice concluding fight at the great wall of China . Like I said this one had loads of action and was pretty well paced , so basically expect a mindless summer movie where you if you sit back and turn off your brain you will enjoy it a bit more . I think this one is not liked as much because people have been getting slightly better fare lately during the summers , which is also a good thing , but I can still appreciate something that does not provoke you to think about it long afterwards .
548895	1111192	329101	8.0	Freddy pretty much is the focus of this one .	I liked this movie , but I couldn't help notice that Freddy seemed to be the focus of this one . Jason was basically in this as another means for the teens to try and get rid of Freddy . Freddy gets the opening as scenes from previous movies are shown of his while Jason gets less time devoted to his origins . . . except for a rather good scene that shows how he drowned in the first place . I am guessing New Line wasn't allowed to show any of Jason's previous movies , as I don't think they had the rights to any of his movies except for the tenth one . This movie has Freddy with basically no power because he is all but forgotten . He uses Jason to kill on Elm Street to get people talking about him again . Why Freddy picks Jason is never really known , you would think any psycho would have done and been more cooperative . Well Jason gets the people talking about Freddy again , but he doesn't just go away , but rather he sticks around and continues to kill . This irks Freddy and this sets up the showdown between the two . There are a couple of subplots in this one that really don't add anything to the film , like the father killing the mother and the cover-up of that murder . That one seemed rather pointless as the dad just disappears after awhile . The fight though is what you paid to see and you get plenty of gory action . In fact the whole movie is rather gory for any movie these days , when I saw the nude scene at the beginning I was worried and thought they wasted the R rating on that and not gore , but there is plenty of bloodshed . Jason gets most of the kills , as there is one cool party scene where he goes hacking away , but Freddy still seems the forefront . Though at times you seem to be watching Friday the 13th , then you seem to shift over to Nightmare on Elm St . Freddy first gets Jason in the dream world and lets just say Jason does not fare to well here as Freddy literally reduces Jason to tears . The battle , however , shifts to the real world at Crystal Lake no less where Jason fares better and the fight is more equal . All in all a pretty good movie , just wish they had come up with better ways to introduce Jason and had better subplots .
549069	1111192	78163	9.0	A very funny end to the Pink Panther series . . .	Or at least it should have been the end as this is the last Pink Panther with the very funny Peter Sellers as the star as he would die sometime after this movie . They would go on to make three more sequels and one that is sort of a remake , but in my view it should have ended with this one . This one has the mob boss after Closseu to prove he still has what it takes to get the job done . In fact Closseu is seemingly killed and guess who is assigned the job of tracking Closseu's killer , none other than his ol ' buddy Chief inspector Dreyfeuss . Of course , Closseu is not really dead and he too is on the case . Lots of funny stuff happen as our inspector tracks down the mobster and you also get to see a very funny eulogy given by Dreyfeuss for Closseu . Sure there are some flaws in the story such as Dreyfeuss even being alive after the last movie and granted this one ended rather differently than the others , but in the end it is a nice little ender to the character of Closseu .
548587	1111192	318627	9.0	Has more of the spirit of the video game than did the first movie .	This movie was a bit of a surprise to me . I thought it would be a pretty decent flick worthy of passing some time , instead I find one of the better action movies I have seen all year . I am one of the few who liked the first one , but this one is much better . I just thought it was more like the game itself without taking itself to seriously or getting to campy . You are thrust into the action right away as people fight for survival against the undead in Racoon City and it all looks really good . Most impressive is the lack of rampant cgi effects or cgi monsters . I do believe the one's with the tongues are the only totally cgi monsters in the movie . The nemesis monster is done completely with makeup it seems and makes me think maybe they could have made a Hulk using the same technique . This one picks up where the last one left off as Alice finds herself in the middle of a virtual war . The additions to the cast are all welcome changes from the last movie as the person who plays Jill Valentine both looks and acts like the character from the game . Scores of undead are killed and various other monsters and enemies line the path as we follow a group of survivors desperate to get out of the sealed city . Kind of sad that this one is so good and it is based on a video game and a movie based on a comic " Alien Vs Predator " was not nearly as good .
548974	1111192	860917	9.0	Could be Final Fantasy XIII if it wanted to be .	Yes , this more so than part twelve of Final Fantasy seems more like that series . However , it is not perfect by any stretch of the imagination as I almost gave this game an eight instead and it probably deserves an eight more . The story has an immortal named Kaim who has no memories of his past sent on a mission to explore an object called Grand Staff . He is joined by Seth another fellow immortal and Jansen who tags along at the request of the obvious villain Gongorra . During your many adventures Kaim regains his lost memories , his lost love , and his lost for good loved ones . The fighting is basically turned based using at times a ring system that when timed right can cause extra damage in battles , causes elemental damage , and can inflict status ailments . Sort of like Shadow Hearts , but not quite as involved or as good . I like Hearts better cause there you used the rings for everything . . . here you only use it for the standard attack . The music is okay , though kind of minimal as it does not exactly blow you away . However , the music was very good during the cut scenes called a thousand years of dreams , a series of stories telling of Kaim's past . Most of them are rather sad , but they add a lot to the game . The problems with the game though are many too . One , Cooke and Mack are a bit annoying at times and they are in the story a lot . I wish Sed was in the story more than these two kiddies . There is also the fact that Kaim is the main character for most of the game , but he does not stand out in any way at the end , really standing back as the pirate Seth takes center stage . Then there is the loading . Why on a next generation console is there so much loading ? Why is the game broken down on four disks and they can not do a better job of transitions than they did is beyond me . Look at Final Fantasy X . . . all on one disc , but it flowed very smoothly . It was also a Ps2 game . I just do not get this at all . However , for the most part you are in store for a really good game , the fighting is fun , the side quests easy enough to do , and the ending was rather good as well . So for the most part a fun role-playing game for the Xbox 360 .
549011	1111192	100814	9.0	Good cast , good story , good movie .	Go figure , but this movie was not exactly successful at the box office , I am guessing it made a lot on video however . It has spawned two sequels and even a television series . This one though was a fun movie to watch thanks in large part to its cast . Kevin Bacon is good as the lead and Fred Ward is also very good . They play a couple of friends living in a very small town in the middle of nowhere . There only wish is to get out of this place and get somewhere big , unfortunately something big is just under their feet . Seems there are these snake creatures living underground and their going on a killing spree . They seemed to have chased an old man up a power line where he died of thirst , then they take out a farmer and his livestock , and then they take out these two working on the side of the road . This movie is rather bloody considering it is a pg-13 movie . The town meets and we are introduced to more colorful characters like the survivalist couple , the stingy grocery owner , and the annoying kid who loves to play a prank or two . There is also a student there studying seismology or something and everyone turns to her for the answers . This movie has a lot of comedy and some great scenes and is an all around enjoyable movie .
548989	1111192	90605	9.0	A horror science fiction action movie so good it almost makes you uncomfortable to watch .	I saw this one in the theaters as a kid with my mom . I was only eleven , but I really liked the looks of this one from the previews , besides I had an alien toy from the original " Alien " movie so I always liked the way it looked . It was creepy and seeing a whole mess of aliens vs marines was to much for me to pass up . My mom took me because she liked the first one too and we had a good time . Of its faults its main one is not really a fault . That is that the movie puts you the viewer in with these people who are in a very dire situation . It makes you nervous that they may not make it out alive and there are very much doubts to whether they will survive the ordeal . No matter how many times I see it I feel this way . Still though what you came to see is also present . . . future army guys ( the marines ) going against an army of aliens . Still the movie builds up rather slowly at first , this lures you into the world of the alien , then it rockets you in with a fire fight where you see very little of the aliens , then finally there is an all out assault . I will not say much about this assault , but to say the marines do not do to well . After this Ripley ( Weaver ) must brave the hoard of aliens alone in an attempt to rescue a little girl all the while a reactor on this planet is about to blow the place sky high . With this alien movie you are in for a wild ride .
548401	1111192	176925	9.0	One of the first games I got when I first got the Nintendo system .	Yes , this game was a bit ground breaking in its day . An action game like no other I had played at the time as it was the first game I could save in and stop playing and pick up the game at another time where I had left off . It was also the first game I had personally played that had ending credits . It was also relatively simple to pick up on as I was rather young when I first played it . The story is rather simple , a boy named Link goes on a quest to save the princess Zelda from the evil Ganon by collecting pieces of an object known as the triforce . He goes through numerous dungeons to find the pieces and also must traverse a very large over world filled with many monsters and locales such as desert , sea , and cemeteries . He receives help from various people including an old man who provides him with a wooden sword to begin his quest . You also have grouches who proceed to take your money if you damage their door . You are also given life by faeries . The combat is simple for the most part , strike your enemies down with your sword . You usually collect objects in dungeons that help you continue further in your quest all the way to Death Mountain . The game could use a bit more depth and the enemies get rather annoying near the end , however this game was a game I could not put down when I first got it to the point I saw that screen shift when I would first go to bed after playing it so much .
548353	1111192	267913	9.0	Suprising	I didn't think this movie would be any good , but I was rather suprised to see how well they followed the cartoon unlike other adaptations of cartoons . Of course it is mainly for kids , but there are a number of jokes for adults as well . The cast did great , and I loved the villian . All an all a pretty solid movie .
548450	1111192	82198	9.0	A role perfect for Arnold .	This like the terminator is a role that is just right for Arnold to play . Here he plays a warrior slave who as a child witnessed his mother killed at the hands of James Earl Jones who is a great bad guy here . He is raised as a slave and he becomes a fighter slave . He is one of the best until one day his master frees him . Once freed he meets allies and enemies alike as a king finally catches him after stealing stuff from this tower that worships snakes . The king requests Conan and his two friends to go find his daughter being held by James Earl Jones . At one point Conan is captured and left for dead before they infiltrate the base . Then near the end of the movie there is one heck of a battle between Jone's men and Conan that is really the highlight of the movie . One gripe though is that through the whole movie you expect Jone's character and Conan to have an epic battle . . . the ending is still satisfying even though that doesn't really come about .
548278	1111192	103873	9.0	Dang this one is gory .	Everyone told me this one was extremely gory and they were right . In fact I tend to agree with what the box says saying it is the goriest film of all time . Scary no , gory YES ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! In fact , it is a comedy . . . kind of a Monty Python episode that is really pushing the limits . It is about this guy who is in love with a girl , but his possesive mother tries to get in the way . She follows them to the zoo , gets bit buy a rat-monkey , dies , comes back as a zombie , and infects others . . . you know same ol ' same ol ' . The sad part is that as gory as it was I couldn't help myself from laughing . I just have to see Peter Jackson's Bad Taste as well . . . One thing about this movie though I just can't figure out why the hero of the story takes that baby to the park ( for those who have seen it you know , and for those who haven't I won't spoil it ) .
549164	1111192	372784	10.0	Christian Bale is Batman .	To my surprise I have to say this is now my favorite Batman movie yet . Why ? Simply put , they finally have cast the right guy to be Batman , a Batman that can stand tall and carry the movie without the help of overly flashy villains who simply say one liners and have stupid plans that really go nowhere . Bale is great as the caped crusader as he actually looks the part both in face and in stature . It also helps that he has the voice for it as he doesn't have to whisper to sound tough . Sure Keaton has his backers , but he gets to many points simply because he was the first ( though he was better than Kilmer and Clooney ) . We have an interesting plot here about how the Batman came into being and believe me he is first and foremost in this flick . The villains are good , perfect casting for the Scarecrow and he is like the comic book , but never does he overact and try to steal the show he is just an element of the plot . All the actors here were good , the story was good , simply put this was Batman as the Dark Knight , and yes this movie was dark . In fact , a bit more darker and an R rating might have been more appropriate . The action is great as no longer does it rely mainly on computer generated graphics , but more on stunts . The city of Gotham also looked great as it looked like a real city rather than a caricature of one with all the action taking place on one obvious set or another ( ala the last two Batman movies ) . A nice twist was thrown in here and there as well , though I thought it was headed in the direction it went . The Batmobile looked rather cool too , it matched the one of the first and second movie in that it looked like a real vehicle rather than just a big toy . So if you go see this Batman , don't look for a goofy embarrassing comedy , but rather a sleek , dark movie more reminiscent of the Batman in the comic books .
548861	1111192	80684	10.0	Still the most visually stunning entry in the Star Wars series .	This for me is the best Star Wars movie . . . I even like it more than the first one . Even today I find it visually stunning and it looks a lot better than anything in the most recent two Star Wars films . The plot is a bit darker as this film in the series seemed to be more aimed at adults , but kids could enjoy it too . It is a shame that the one scene in this film that is the most memorable will be kind of wiped out thanks to the new trilogy . You know the one with Luke facing Vader and Vader makes the startling revelation . Anyone who watches these movies in the so-called correct order is not going to be very surprised . Though if they do watch it in order they may never get to this classic cause they will probably stop after the Clone Wars cause lets face it the new triology just isn't very good . Watch the original trilogy and forget the new . . . I just wish these were availble on dvd .
548700	1111192	187738	10.0	Pretty Cool	This was one action-packed thrill ride . Though I would say I liked it about the same as the first one even though it had more action , the first one had a better plot . Though I understood everything and did not find any of the plot twists to confusing or anything like a lot of others complain about . The darker setting is very cool and the European setting makes this movie have a Gothic setting . It is a combination of the very old and new that gives this film great atmosphere . The plot is there is a new breed of vampire on the streets and normal vampires need Blade's help in disposing of them , but can he really trust them . I highly recommend this flick .
548707	1111192	142235	10.0	Pretty cool and fast paced .	Fast paced is the best way to describe this DBZ movie . Piccolo is apparently killed and Gohan gets kidnapped so Goku goes to the lair of Garlic jr an evil person with ambitions to rule the world , and who has already been granted immortality from the dragon . Battles ensue as Krillin joins the battle to help Goku rescue his son and the thought to be dead Piccolo also appears , but not to help , he just owes the henchmen a little pay back . All in all a pretty cool installment of DBZ .
