446705	1048771	239381	3.0	Hardly more than a cheap exploitation film . . .	This riddle of a film is directed by a man who narrates the DVD with a commentary that makes about as much sense as the film . When you finish hearing it , you will have no more understanding of the story or characters than you did before - - except for one thing . You will learn that he harbored sexual fantasies about young garbage collectors that he viewed as they went about their tasks outside his window . Thus , he made up a scenario about such fantasies . The faults are extensive , beginning with the disjointed screenplay which sheds no light at all on any of the authority figures surrounding the young protagonist or why they are all forcing him to submit to sexual humiliation . His obsessive desire for the man of his dreams is based on one chance meeting and thereafter he stalks the man until he finally " catches " him - - by tying him up in tape and handcuffing him , then depositing him in a dark alley behind his house where he leaves him to wander off to a place that holds endless fascination for the director - - a garbage dump . The sexual scenes are not even sensual , let alone truly erotic , and most of them take place in the dark , with some of them simulated and not graphic at all . The actors are all unknowns with no previous experience and go through their paces with a modicum of credibility . It's as though the director tried to say something important without saying anything at all except to give us visual images of a deserted landscape , a handsome boy and his quest for some sort of sexual bonding with another man . But a story about dark obsession needs a script , needs characters , needs a beginning , middle and end and this has no structure at all . Fittingly , it all ends in a garbage dump . It's a riddle that not even the Director's Commentary clears up . He himself seems to make no sense of most of the proceedings , so why should we ? It's pretentious , at best , and hardly more than a cheap exploitation film . Astonishingly , it has won a few awards at film festivals which can only make you wonder what they were thinking .
446675	1048771	56526	4.0	Why they should never make remakes of classic films . . .	STATE FAIR - - the 1962 version - - is barely watchable . If it weren't for the Rodgers & Hammerstein songs , it would be a complete misfire . As it is , it just makes you yearn for the simple charm of the 1945 version that starred JEANNE CRAIN , DANA ANDREWS , DICK HAYMES and VIVIAN BLAINE in the roles occupied here by PAMELA TIFFIN , BOBBY DARIN , PAT BOONE and ANN-MARGRET . Jose Ferrer really struck out with this one , eliminating all the charm of the Technicolored version starring Crain as Margy , the girl who meets a newspaper man and falls hard . Then too , FAY BAINTER was ideal as the homespun mother worried about her chance of winning the prize at the fair for her jam , while here it's an ill-used ALICE FAYE making a sentimental return to Fox after years of retirement from the big screen . The songs are done only adequately , no more , and ANN-MARGRET cheapens the story with her interpretation of the singer at the fair . And even ALICE FAYE's throaty way with a song seems diminished by time . Summing up : Completely tasteless , boring version of the " American as apple pie " musical that first surfaced in 1945 .
446566	1048771	34985	4.0	Horrible . . . this is the kind of programmer that gave Poverty Row a bad rap . . .	How anyone can lavish even the faintest praise on this junk is baffling to me , since THE LIVING GHOST is a cliché ridden mystery with some vain attempts at humor . Furthermore , it's ineptly performed by the entire cast and appears to have been filmed on a quickie basis with no close-ups introducing the chief suspects . JAMES DUNN makes an abysmal attempt at playing detective and JOAN WOODBURY is no more successful as the lame-brained secretary of the lobotomized man at the center of the mystery . Question is : Which one in the wealthy man's household tried to do him in ? None of the suspects have enough time on screen to become viable characters and it's never quite clear why Dunn takes such an immediate dislike to the poor butler whom he treats with utter contempt , even when he's being helpful . Juvenile at best , it's the kind of film the Monogram factory churned out on a weekly basis in the ' 40s , barely deserving a spot at the bottom end of a double feature bill . A ridiculous tax on anyone's reason or patience - - mercifully , it runs only one hour .
445589	1048771	276919	4.0	Why must a morality tale be so hard to digest ? ? ?	The Thornton Wilder OUR TOWN approach to staging a small town cross-section of townspeople using a stylized approach ( few props and bits of scenery ) , has been used again sixty or more years later for DOGVILLE . However , I found the results stagnant and artless , instead of artful . No doubt the pseudo-intellectuals will pounce on this sort of disagreement and proclaim the film as some kind of masterpiece . It all makes as much sense as the seven figurines in Ma Ginger's window . Dialog is supposed to move a plot forward - - but not in this case . It crawls through so much pretentious prattle in examining why NICOLE KIDMAN should stay or leave Dogsville that it is stultifying in its emptiness . To put it kindly , Kidman's performance adds nothing to her stature as an actress . Her work can best be described as tentative . PAUL BETTANY , on the other hand , rises to the occasion with an earnest performance as her best friend in the village . The bareness of the staging is equal to the bareness of the plot . Very disappointing to watch people like LAUREN BACALL ( totally wasted as Ma Ginger ) and BEN GAZZARA ( as the blind man ) in such sketchily written parts . Summing up : Definitely not my cup of tea . Even morality tales should make their point by the time the story is halfway over . The over-the-top ending with the entrance of JAMES CAAN can only be described as deplorable .
447481	1048771	30108	4.0	Weak little musical doesn't give anyone a fair chance to shine . . .	This is strictly JUDY GARLAND before she became the Judy we all know . Ditto for the ill used FANNY BRICE , whose " Baby Snooks " routine on radio was socko with millions during the ' 40s but looks bad here . The story , a dumb one even for MGM family musicals , is about a bunch of eccentrics in a family that are intent on putting on a show ( where have we heard that one before ? ) , and bursting into song numbers at the drop of a hat . Unfortunately , none of the numbers are anything worth remembering ( or hearing , for that matter ) . The whole thing falls as flat as a pancake by the time it's even into the middle section . BILLIE BURKE does her usual fluttery act as a dizzy mother and MGM was still , at this point , trying to groom ALLAN JONES for stardom , but he's even more wooden than Nelson Eddy ever was . He too is saddled with some hard to like songs to give his tenor pipes a workout . As one who enjoyed the best MGM musicals which came along in the ' 40s , from a studio whose musical talent was the uncontested best , this is simply a foolish yawner with no interest except serving as an early glimpse of JUDY GARLAND , who is unable to overcome this weak kind of rubbish . Same goes for the entire cast . Summing up : Strictly below average as entertainment .
446708	1048771	29804	4.0	Dreary stuff . . . RKO giving Fontaine the starlet treatment . . .	A man runs for mayor on a bet . The mayor's daughter meets him at a political campaign and it's hate at first sight . The chill only lasts until their next encounter , but by then we know this is a formula romantic comedy and they'll both be in love for the windup . After a few more misunderstandings , PRESTON FOSTER and JOAN FONTAINE walk off arm in arm and the simple plot is over in an hour . Strictly an RKO programmer that passed the time in ' 37 , a time when JOAN FONTAINE was being promoted as a new RKO starlet but given material that would have defeated any other ingenue . There is nothing here that suggests she would go on to an Oscar-winning career . PRESTON FOSTER carries the main burden , as does Herbert Mundin as his timid valet , and the whole thing has the look of a B-film that nobody had much faith in . Interesting only to see the two leads in their prime but with very little chemistry between them . Trivia note : Whether it's because his make-up is too dark or not , even in B & W Foster's eyes come across as bluer than Paul Newman's .
446759	1048771	39098	5.0	The sparkle is missing in flat comedy	Before Olivia de Havilland made her remarkable comeback in 1946's To Each His Own , she stepped in as a last minute replacement for Paulette Goddard in ' The Well Groomed Bride ' , her first film after her two year legal battle with Warner Bros . Unfortunately , the script is so slight ( about de Havilland and Milland fighting over rights to the last champagne bottle in San Francisco - - she wants it for her wedding , he wants it to christen a ship ) . The laughs are scant although Olivia , Ray Milland and Sonny Tufts try hard to keep things bubbling . De Havilland manages to be pert and pretty as the heroine , Milland is his usual adept self at comedy and even Sonny Tufts manages to make his big " conceited muscle " role likeable at times - - but the whole thing fails to get off the ground . The weak script defeats everyone , including Percy Kilbride as de Havilland's dad . Only avid fans of Ray Milland or de Havilland should watch this one - - which does not turn up on TV these days - - Paramount obviously deciding it wasn't worth saving .
445320	1048771	39301	5.0	Above average B-film is interesting . . . has a polished look . . .	It's a pleasure re-discovering how well made these minor B films were at MGM . This is another entry in the Dr . Gillespie series at MGM , the ones without Lew Ayres as Dr . Kildare . Instead , JAMES CRAIG is a young doctor treating a very troubled young woman ( LUCILLE BREMER ) whose guardians want her committed to an asylum for observation . Craig immediately thinks otherwise , although why he's so sure of her sanity is hard to determine . That's one of the weaknesses of the story and he's rather stubborn in his conviction . LUCILLE BREMER plays the distraught patient as though she's seen too many Bette Davis movies . She paces about and stares into the camera lens with wide-eyed terror , all in what appears to be a pale imitation of Miss Davis . She even resembles the younger Davis physically in extreme close-ups . At Blair Hospital , Keye Luke and Lioneal Barrymore are on hand for some comic relief , as is Marie Blake as the switchboard operator and Alma Krueger as a stern and knowing nurse . Reliable character actor Henry Stephenson is the girl's guardian . JAMES CRAIG is stolid and solemn as the stubborn doctor and LIONEL BARRYMORE is his usual blustery self as Dr . Gillespie , but the story's resolution is just too patly contrived for believability , including the narcosynthesis explanation . JAYNE MEADOWS makes a nice impression in one of her more wholesome roles . As a simplistic B-film , it's of more than average interest .
447434	1048771	56625	5.0	Limp melodrama crashes with a thud . . .	Next to TWO WEEKS IN ANOTHER TOWN , THE BAD AND THE BEAUTIFUL looks like an all-around masterpiece of subtle drama . Both take a cynical look at the behind-the-scenes backstabbing in Hollywood . The story gets off to a slow start and then continues to move at a snail's pace , especially through the early scenes where we're introduced to characters like EDWARD G . ROBINSON and his shrewish wife CLAIRE TREVOR . Robinson seems to be playing a thinly disguised version of Darryl F . Zanuck and Trevor seems to think she has to overdo the tirades in scene after scene so she can win another supporting Oscar like the one she snared for KEY LARGO . The school of overacting seems to be rampant here . Irwin Shaw was obviously cynical about his own treatment by the Hollywood studios and has concocted a melodrama that is even more bitter about studio politics than THE BIG KNIFE or THE BAD AND THE BEAUTIFUL . It's strange that Vincente Minnelli would be the director chosen to bring this story to life , but suffice it to say that it's not one of his best directorial achievements . KIRK DOUGLAS does a decent job in the central role but most of the performances are absurdly over-the-top in a film wherein the script itself is the main problem . Sorry , can't work up any enthusiasm for this one .
447710	1048771	39366	5.0	Silly comedy trifle about a talking dog . . .	I always enjoyed WALTER ABEL , one of the most likable character actors of the ' 40s , but THE FABULOUS JOE gives him star billing in a minor feature that attempts to be a witty screwball comedy . It fails . The jokes are thin , the premise is ridiculous and actor Abel seems to know his material is far beneath him . Only SHELDON LEONARD as a tough guy enamored of Marie Wilson , lends any true comic flair to the proceedings . Miss Wilson reads her lines like a girl in her first high school play with a flat effect , showcasing her shapely figure but little else . The story involves a henpecked man who gains courage from a drink called a " Mystery Gardenia " and thereafter has conversations with his dog , who gets him into all kinds of trouble - - slapstick stuff involving Wilson and his wife's fits of jealousy . DONALD MEEK and DONALD MacBRIDE have standard supporting roles and two uncredited bit roles are filled by TOMMY NOONAN ( as an elevator boy ) and ELLEN CORBY . But the camera is on ABEL all the time . Summing up : A foolish comedy that strains for laughs , suitable only as the second half of a double feature in the ' 40s .
447829	1048771	198551	5.0	America's propaganda to boost WWII morale . . .	Propaganda was sometimes pretty heavy-handed during the WWII years and " I Am An American " demonstrates this point to perfection . It's about as flag waving as you can get , but taken in the context of those war years , it's understandable that every major studio in Hollywood was coming up with films of this ilk . It also happens to be a sketchy history lesson , encompassing so much of America's history in fleeting montages devoted to the discovery and building of a great country , peopled by all nationalities . It's obviously a " united we stand , divided we fall " kind of philosophy that sets the tone for the film . DENNIS MORGAN is pictured at a morale boosting rally to sell war bonds and delivers a very patriotic speech in professional fashion . Obviously , this was intended as Warner's salute to Americans during the height of WWII . It follows the history of a Polish family and its contributions to the war effort through the sacrificing of many young men to fight various wars .
447958	1048771	35726	5.0	Light hearted Boston Blackie caper with same old formula . . .	Once again Boston Blackie puts one over on the police who wrongly accuse him of a crime he never committed . He uses his wits and ingenuity to outwit them at every turn - - each episode more incredible than the one before . But it's entertaining in a formula way , with CHESTER MORRIS obviously enjoying himself as Blackie and Inspector Farraday finally congratulating him on capturing the real criminal . DOUGLAS FOWLEY as Nails gives his usual hard-bitten performance as the villain , enjoyable as always in whatever supporting role he assumes . It's a low-budget entry , designed to fit the second half of a double bill , and moves at a brisk pace in little more than hour . Morris is surrounded by the usual Columbia cast of " Blackie " performers .
447901	1048771	30184	5.0	1930's programmer is strictly fluff for teen-aged girls . . .	For starters , ANNE SHIRLEY , wearing a dark bathrobe with white collar design , looks exactly like Olivia de Havilland in an early scene from THE DARK MIRROR . I always thought they resembled each other strongly , but never more so than in this film . The story is the same old trite stuff about the petty squabbles among girls at a boarding school who become upset when the school monitor ( Anne Shirley ) has to report their extra-curricular activities to the school principal ( GLORIA HOLDEN ) . Pretty blonde NAN GREY becomes the primary target when Shirley spies her coming home late after a night out . You know the material is dated when the girls are gathered to listen to a speech " on a very important subject - - charm " , by an aristocratic lady foolishly extolling the virtues of exuding charm , the most important ingredient young ladies of the world are supposed to have in 1938 , no matter how air-headed they are . Charm is distinctly lacking in the screenplay . Although Anne Shirley plays her teen role with an overabundance of energetic innocence , it's hard to see why Selznick , a year later , tested her for Melanie in " Gone with the Wind " . At least , not on the basis of this girlish performance . It's the kind of B-film you can easily skip without missing anything .
447294	1048771	22453	5.0	Garbo / Gable chemistry wasted on weak romantic plot . . .	GRETA GARBO fans will undoubtedly forgive the screenplay which has Greta and CLARK GABLE romantically involved in an on again / off again relationship that is the basis for the whole movie . And , of course , Garbo's favorite cinematographer , William Daniels , is behind the camera making sure that she gets her fair share of lush close-ups . It starts out promisingly enough as a Gothic melodrama with Garbo fleeing the advances of a drunken fiancé ALAN HALE and rushing out into the storm . She seeks shelter in a barn but is discovered by CLARK GABLE who promptly takes a shine to her and invites her to take shelter under his roof . The opening scenes with Garbo and Gable have an innocent charm that makes them delightful to watch , with Gable giving a more natural performance than Garbo who already has a bag of transparent acting tricks . The plot thickens when Susan Lenox is forced to flee Gable's residence when her strict father and fiancé show up to bring her home . She ends up taking refuge on a circus train and ends up being " kept " by one of the managers . When she's reunited with Gable , it begins a series of misunderstandings . Garbo plays her role like the real diva she was , even pronouncing Gable's name - - " Rodney " - - in a melodramatic way . It's strictly downhill into pulp romance territory for the rest of the way . It's Gable who gives one of his most likable performances and sustains interest in the story's development - - not Garbo . Summing up : Only for die-hard Garbo fans . Noteworthy for a very fine beginning which soon lapses into mediocrity .
447132	1048771	47209	5.0	Inferior remake of " The Lodger " has Palance as The Ripper . . .	Based on " The Lodger " by Marie Belloc Lowndes , this is another take on the Jack the Ripper legend that takes place in Victorian London's West End side . Sinister looking JACK PALANCE is perfectly well cast as the young man seeking lodgings in a rooming house during a period when the city is aghast over a series of brutal murders . The story begins with ISABEL JEWELL as a " lady of the night " getting her comeuppance from The Ripper . Produced by Fox at a time when the studio system was collapsing , it looks as though it was filmed on the quick ( and cheaply ) , using sets from other Fox films , particularly the atmospheric London streets with cobblestone and gaslights , a village set often used in Fox films of the period . Although it follows the Ripper story faithfully , there's nothing new about the presentation . Secondary roles are filled by lesser names like RHYS WILLIAMS and CONSTANCE SMITH and one gets the feeling it's strictly been given perfunctory treatment by writers and director . Smith is a very pretty lady but fails to make the same sort of impression Merle Oberon did in " The Lodger " in the same role of the showgirl . BYRON PALMER is rather colorless as a police inspector who falls in love with Smith . Strangely enough , JACK PALANCE is never as menacing as Laird Cregar was in " The Lodger . " There's more of the " smokehouse ham " in his performance than anything else . Summing up : The Ripper tale has been done better countless times .
447669	1048771	29992	5.0	Abbreviated with many ludicrous changes and badly cast . . .	Reginald Owen does an acceptable job as Scrooge , although one can easily spot the age make-up necessary to transform him into Ebenezer Scrooge . But this version is unforgivable for the many scenes cut from the story and for the foolish additions that have been added , especially during the film's first twenty minutes . This is the kind of film that will give purists nightmares . Production-wise , it's not a bad looking film with picture postcard views of a Victorian London created on the MGM sound stages . But none of the casting can be called inspired , beginning with Reginald Owen who was a replacement for Lionel Barrymore ( who would have been perfect in the role ) . And his change from a bitter miser to a kindlier old man is not convincing at all , given the many cuts in Dickens ' material . Attempting to tell the story in a mere one hour and nine minutes made all the cutting of scenes from the book absolutely necessary . Puzzling is the fact that this opened at Radio City Music Hall in December of ' 38 - - a showplace for major films accompanied by a stage show . One can only suppose that the stage show that year was a lengthier one than usual . Gene Lockhart , a very capable actor , is totally miscast as a rotund and middle-aged Bob Crachett . Barry MacKay does much better as Scrooge's nephew , Fred , given much more prominence here than in other versions of the tale . Ann Rutherford is a very pretty Spirit of Christmas Past but seems another case of miscasting . Most troublesome of all is Terry Kilburn as Tiny Tim , who looks like he's more than twelve when he should be a tiny tot . All in all , a totally routine presentation of the famous story , hampered by having too many meaningful scenes cut and replaced with material that is not even true to the spirit of the Dickens novel . The much darker British version with Alastair Sim was far superior and , of course , followed the story all the way with superb casting .
445728	1048771	53214	5.0	Remarkable only for Webb again playing the father of a brood of children . . .	CLIFTON WEBB , given the chance to " act " in LAURA , THE RAZOR'S EDGE and other fine films , is the Clifton Webb the public wanted to see . He made his mark as Mr . Belvedere in a number of Belvedere films and audiences loved him . But Fox did him a disservice by forcing him to play the remarkable man in this film , an 1890s gentleman married to two wives who know nothing about the other's existence . The only remarkable thing is that this time it doesn't work at all , plodding along in an attempt to be fresh and funny while at the same time irritatingly forcing its premise on the viewer by making all the other protesting townspeople look like old fogies . The only supporting role character worth mentioning is CHARLES COBURN , again adding his own special brand of ornery charm to a role that doesn't deserve his presence . DOROTHY McGUIRE gives another one of her understated performances as one of the wives . Unfortunately , an annoying performance by JILL ST . JOHN ( with high-pitched voice playing " young " ) gets the film off to a bad start . RON ELY is much better as her sweetheart . Henry Levin's direction is stilted and there's not enough comedy to really enjoy it as a Clifton Webb film . Saddling him with 17 children does not alter the fact that his prissy ways make the basic premise entirely unlikely . This sort of thing ( without the bigamy ) was done more effectively ( and much more pleasantly ) in CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN . Technically , the film is fine . Sets and costumes look good in Technicolor and provide the charm missing in the script .
445181	1048771	70040	5.0	Too uneventful . . . fails to make a point with nothing more than haunting imagery . . .	I have to confess that I had to stop watching more than halfway through because tedium overcame my ability to concentrate on more of this sensitive film from Spain about youth and lost innocence . At least that's what I think the filmmaker was trying to develop , but the theme remained pretty obscure up until the point I stopped watching . The photography is gorgeous and vistas of Spain , supposedly during the ' 40s under Franco's rule , are intriguing , if a bit barren . The early scenes of the villagers gathering to watch a movie on folded chairs in a primitive looking town hall of some kind are fascinating to watch and one hopes that some strong characterizations will be developed . But fascination soon turns to tedium when the film dwells uneventfully on two girls who have witnessed the FRANKENSTEIN movie and are caught up in the concept of the monster's contact with the little girl . From that point on , it's a film too uneventful to make a satisfying viewing experience - - at least for me . It gives no insight into the connection between the villagers and the girls and what they have experienced from seeing the film which obviously made a deep impression on the impressionistic girls . Perhaps another viewing of the complete film at some future date will change my mind , but for now I can't give this a strong recommendation . Deliberately ambiguous until the end , it fails to connect the dots .
447596	1048771	87332	5.0	Bill Murray comedy is a silly cult classic but not screamingly funny . . .	I never did find this one screamingly funny , as some Bill Murray fans obviously do . It's got a preposterous story with some good special effects ( for those slimy , jello-like green images ) and if quirky characters are your thing , you'll find plenty of them among the cast of characters . But a wittier script by Bill Murray would have helped . In other words , I can take it or leave it - - that's exactly how I felt when this comedy was over . Sure , there were some fun moments with Rick Moranis as a nosy neighbor and I'll admit Murray and Dan Ackroyd have some good one-liners . Then too , Sigourney Weaver is amusing as the gal with a fridge from hell , but by the time the overlong story got to its mindblowing conclusion , I was longing for " The End " to appear on the screen . Not my cup of tea as comedies go . Best moments were when the ghosts were on the loose and things got a little unpredictable toward the conclusion . But what happened in between these ghostly apparitions left a lot to be desired .
446086	1048771	39848	5.0	Routine , lackluster follow-up to ' The Adventures of Rusty ' . . .	Malicious gossip about a war veteran ( STEPHEN DUNNE ) is at the center of this routine story in the Rusty series starring TED DONALDSON as the boy who tries to befriend the veteran only to have the friendship cut short by an accident involving explosives that hurt Rusty . STEPHEN DUNNE gives an earnest , likable performance as the misunderstood veteran soldier and THURSTON HALL does a nice job as a helpful and trusted lawyer Gibson who defends the man accused of a misdemeanor for using explosives / The final courtroom scene tends to be too preachy in its summation of small-town American values , as well intended as it is , even though Thurston Hall delivers it well . But the story essentially is a weak one , bolstered only by the likable performances and the amazingly well trained canine mentioned in the title . The only real interest in the story comes from the mystery surrounding Dunne and his erratic behavior , which is only solved by the courtroom testimony he's forced to give about his background . Summing up : A small trifle about a small-town incident used to showcase the abilities of a dog named Rusty and his owner , Donaldson .
445633	1048771	29947	5.0	Classic screwball comedy but not my cup of tea . . .	I'll admit that Hepburn and Grant give their all to this screwball comedy about a paleontologist ( CARY GRANT ) seeking a bone for his museum , who runs into an eccentric young woman ( KATHARINE HEPBURN ) and can't seem to do anything right from then on . It's rightly famous for the scene where her ripped dress causes confusion in a nightclub . But it's mostly a battle of the sexes between two equally stubborn people and I can only say that Hepburn's Susan drives me up the wall - - probably one of the most annoying characters she's ever played with all of her Hepburn mannerisms in full gear . Grant wears horn-rimmed glasses most of the time in effort to look like a handsomer version of Harold Lloyd . He certainly has comic abilities with screwball material . There's nothing subtle about the humor - - especially when the two are involved with keeping a baby leopard under wraps . CHARLIE RUGGLES and MAY ROBSON and BARRY FITZGERALD do their best to add some merriment to the proceedings , but the endless sight gags are standard for this kind of fluff and become a little tiresome when everything Hepburn does continues to backfire with disastrous results . Howard Hawks deserves credit for keeping things moving along briskly , but it's never been one of my favorite screwball comedies because none of the characters have a grain of common sense - - especially Miss Hepburn's madcap heiress .
446345	1048771	22180	5.0	Tiresome WWI romantic comedy / drama with William Boyd as the star . . .	Three carnival workers romance the same girl until WWI interferes with their plans . They join the Navy and the plot meanders all over the place with tiresome effect . WILLIAM BOYD ( later " Hopalong Cassidy " ) spouts his dialog in a slow-moving way , and ROBERT ARMSTRONG and JAMES GLEASON mug their way through some silly shenanigans as sailors looking for a good time . Boyd is the Chief Petty Officer who comes out of retirement to rejoin the service . GINGER ROGERS is the carnival gal who can't seem to decide whether to get serious about Boyd or not , until the finale . It's hopelessly contrived and full of hokey situations , dated dialog and interesting only for a glimpse of the Naval ships . Summing up : Totally unsatisfying from almost every standpoint .
447079	1048771	39686	5.0	Barbara never looked more glamorous , even facing a " Camille-like " situation . . .	Women's films , as they were called in the ' 40s , seldom offered a star a more glamorous way of leaving this world than THE OTHER LOVE , with BARBARA STANWYCK checking herself into a Swiss sanitarium to be treated for tuberculosis and promptly falling in love with her young doctor , David NIVEN against a background of Alpine beauty . Stanwyck has got to be the healthiest patient in Hollywood history and she gets even more glamorous as she moves toward impending doom . So does the music by Miklos Rozsa . And as if one leading man isn't enough , the script has her leaving the safety ( and boredom ) of the clinic to go chasing after a tough motorcyclist ( RICHARD CONTE ) for one last fling . It's syrupy romance straight from the pages of a Cosmopolitan magazine story - - but no , in this case , straight from the pages of a novel by Erich Maria Remarque , who gave the world ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT , but also turkeys like ARCH OF TRIUMPH . Stanwyck's fans will be too busy admiring her wardrobe to view the plot with any skepticism at all , but others might find it just a little too pat and contrived , even for this genre of pulp romance .
447204	1048771	25872	5.0	Average B-film programmer fails to live up to its potential . . .	For a film that deals with an interesting subject like fake mediums , this ' 34 mystery / comedy fails to hit the mark . It's not particularly impressive as a mystery and the comedy is on the weak side . It's a B-film programmer with ZASU PITTS and SLIM SUMMERVILLE providing the comic relief while others carry the straight plot line . Pitts and Summerville play WILLIAM GAXTON's assistants in a magic act where he bills himself as The Great La Salle . BRUCE CABOT hires them to take part in a fake seance at a wealthy woman's home where a young woman has been receiving messages from a dead husband . RALPH MORGAN is suspected of being a swindler trying to deceive the woman at her swanky home on Long Island . Unfortunately , ZASU PITTS is saddled with a ditzy role beyond belief . And to make matters worse , nobody else in the cast has lines that are any smoother or wittier . " Not a very friendly fellow , " says Gaxton . " About as friendly as a rattlesnake , " says Summerville . That gives you an idea of the wit and sophistication . The suspense , of course , lies in finding out how the fake seance will go and who the real culprits are in the household . Not hard to guess the predictable outcome . Summing up : A clumsy mystery / comedy hardly worth bothering about .
447961	1048771	20902	5.0	Buster Keaton and Anita Page in early sound film trifle . . .	BUSTER KEATON and ANITA PAGE are saddled with some lame dialog and tacky situations in this hokey comedy about an aspiring beauty contest winner ( Page ) who travels to Hollywood with her mother in hope of becoming America's next motion picture sweetheart . It's a look at early Hollywood and for that reason alone it's fairly entertaining . ROBERT MONTGOMERY is featured as Larry Mitchell , a movie star who takes an interest in Page after a chance meeting on the train to Hollywood . Keaton is his usual bumbling self but the script is a mess with dialog that is painfully unfunny . Nobody can really save the comedy / musical from being way less than ordinary . Keaton with stilted lines is less funny than when he's pantomiming it up in silent films . Robert Montgomery is dubbed for a couple of awkward musical numbers , all done in the early style of MGM talkies before a word like " finesse " could be assigned to them . The tinny sound recording is no help . Best excuse for watching is to see how things improved rapidly in the late thirties and forties , but this one has to be regarded as strictly a curiosity piece for fans of Buster Keaton and early sound films . Painfully unfunny in an amateurish kind of way for a film from MGM . Interesting only for a glimpse of early Hollywood pioneering .
445654	1048771	82533	5.0	Make-up : 10 - - Script : 3 - - Acting : 3 . . .	Only until midway through THE HOWLING is there any real hint of danger or excitement in the werewolf scheme of things . Up until then , we have pretty blonde DEE WALLACE advised to seek rest and relaxation by a doctor ( PATRICK MACNEE ) who thinks a trip to a country retreat will soothe her nerves . Of course , what he neglects to tell her is that the resort is creeping with werewolves and she's a newspaper woman who will soon have quite a scoop for her target audience of TV viewers . We know that she'll have a scoop because at the end of this messy horror film , the final horror twist is the one we suspected would be pulled at the last minute . DEE WALLACE tries to look alarmed in her big close-up reaction shots but looks as though she's just having a bad day away from the office even when a werewolf is breathing down her neck . PATRICK MACNEE does nothing to make us think he's doing anything more than wasting his time in this poorly constructed exploitation film for horror fans , and JOHN CARRADINE is almost unrecognizable as one of the foremost character actors of movies during the ' 30s , ' 40s and ' 50s . Believe me , you have better things to do with your time than expect anything more than some good glimpses of Rick Baker's expertise with make-up for the transformation scenes . This is one poor excuse for a horror film and doesn't set any standards for things to come in this genre .
446891	1048771	40331	5.0	Betsy stalks Grant in weak comedy . . .	Anyone watching EVERY GIRL SHOULD BE MARRIED today can see why Betsy Drake never made it as a big star . She's an acquired taste with her thin , pensive face and her thick lips and that little lisp that comes and goes while she gushes about her dream man - - CARY GRANT - - whom she married shortly after finishing the film . She did have a certain flair for light comedy but here it's wasted on a silly script that has her running after Grant in a manner that would have called for a restraining order in today's society . Grant just sort of walks through a role he could have played in his sleep and the gags , only a few of which are genuinely amusing , are much too bland to recall once the film is over . FRANCHOT TONE is completely wasted but DIANA LYNN has a few good moments as Betsy's more sensible friend . But no one is at their best and it's the kind of film quickly forgotten once you've viewed it .
447592	1048771	102007	5.0	Weak made-for-TV low budget try at the horror genre . . .	Not only is this a weak haunted house story ( although based on a true life story ) , but the acting and direction is downright foolish and unconvincing . The special effects are possibly the worst feature of all , with the demons completely lacking any sort of evil presence and simply shapeless blobs . You have to wonder how someone like DIANE BAKER got talked into doing this turkey . She's just one of a series of people who try to rid the house of demons at the request of homeowners JEFFREY DeMUNN and SALLY KIRKLAND . Kirkland's awkward handling of cigarettes , together with her over-the-top performance , is distracting , to say the least . Of all the adults in the cast , DeMunn is the most competent . But nothing happens that hasn't been featured in a dozen other stories about haunted houses in normal looking neighborhoods . This shows its made-for-TV origins in every scene and compares unfavorably to many other stories told on any number of cable stations dealing with real tales of haunted homes . Not recommended - - nor does it have a satisfying ending - - merely a message on the screen that a few years later a better exorcism was sanctioned by the Catholic Church and this time it was successful .
447515	1048771	5310	5.0	Enjoyable short film has some clever touches . . .	I'm sure FATTY ARBUCKLE and MABEL NORMAND deserved their popularity back in 1915 when silents were attracting audiences to this new thing called " the movies " , but frankly it's easy to dismiss it today as little more than a nostalgic look at Hollywood's primitive beginnings . Both are likable enough and the set-up is good for laughs , as they visit a park and interact with an organ grinder and his monkey . This leads to the scenes were Mabel is alone at home letting her imagination run away her and suspecting that the gangster described in the newspaper is trying to get into her home . The mysterious quiver of the drapes frightens her for awhile , until the moment arrives when the organ grinder himself dares to part the curtains and reveal the culprit to be his monkey . What strikes me most about the early silent films is the tackiness of the sets , not to mention the unbelievable bad taste in set decoration and furnishings . This is especially true here , as Mabel's house is a house of horrors as far as " set decoration " is concerned . Summing up : Watchable but certainly not the best of the duo's collaborations .
446699	1048771	29179	5.0	Madame X on a budget . . . but oh , what melodramatic courtroom proceedings !	First of all , let me say that GLADYS GEORGE does a remarkably fine job as " Madame X " . But whomever decided to do the final courtroom scenes with an over-the-top argument by her lawyer son and hysterics from the woman on the stand , well . . . this maudlin scene reduces whatever credibility Miss George gives to her role . The final courtroom scenes are just too over-baked even by 1930 standards of the tear-jerker . The cast is competent enough but the production has the look of an A-film given a B-budget , helped somewhat by the presence of actors like Warren Williams , Reginald Denny and Henry Daniell in the cast . GLADYS GEORGE does the slattern extremely well , looking very much like a woman under the influence not only because of the realistic make-up but because of her very posture and mannerisms . Toward the end , during the final meeting with her son in jail , she looks like the broken woman she is supposed to be . All of this was rehashed in the 1960s with LANA TURNER in the title role . Turner was fine and almost matched George in the final scenes of degradation . But in this version , Sam Wood should have tempered the melodrama in the climactic courtroom scene . Instead , there is no restraint whatsoever . He lets JOHN BEAL ( as George's son ) go on too long on a sentimental monologue that defies credibility . This scene alone is so overplayed that it makes the film strictly a product of the 1930s . The mother / son angle of the ' 60's version ( between Turner and Kier Dullea ) was done with much more restraint and believability and had the touching effect needed to make the tear-jerker work .
446146	1048771	277866	5.0	One gag does not make a whole film . . .	Here's a Max Linder short that runs too long when it's based on a single incident at the beach . He attempts to take a photo of a woman in a bathing suit ( and she's no beauty ) , waiting while she swims around like she thinks she's an early embodiment of Esther Williams . He's waiting for her to emerge so he can snap the photo , but she fools him by diving beneath the sea ( like an overweight mermaid ) and running ashore some distance away so he doesn't see her . Naturally , he thinks she's drowned and attracts quite a crowd with his frantic arm waving , all of whom think a woman has just disappeared in the water . When she emerges from the bathhouse , fear turns to joy . That's it , for the plot . It's all very primitive looking , none of the sight gags are memorable and it runs too long - - even for a short . Summing up : Not worth a peek .
445517	1048771	29047	5.0	Except for the fire - - just awful ! !	I love ALICE FAYE , TYRONE POWER and DON AMECHE when they have a good script , great tunes and wonderful direction - - as in ALEXANDER'S RAGTIME BAND . But IN OLD CHICAGO is insufferable in terms of story , pacing , acting and any sense of reality until the O'Leary cow knocks over that lantern . Then we're treated to one of the best fire sequences ever shown on screen - - long before the aid of computer technology . If only the rest of the picture had been able to match the fire ! Faye is given some over-the-top costuming which cheapens her overall appearance to such an extent that it's hard to see why she's the main attraction for Ameche and Power . Power was still at the pretty boy stage of his good looks and his acting had not quite jelled when he did this role . The fight sequence between him and Ameche is well handled though . Ameche simply fades into the background as the good brother . Faye was said to be pleased with the fact that she was given a more dramatic role for a change . Unfortunately , not much can be said with what she did with this opportunity . Alice Brady is up to the demands of her role as the O'Leary mother who wants her sons to make their mark in the world . However , the film comes to life only for the final twenty minutes or so of fire . Otherwise , it's got a story as dull as dishwater and provides Alice Faye with one of her least appealing roles . It makes ALEXANDER'S RAGTIME BAND look like a masterpiece . It takes much too long to get to that famous 1871 fire .
447482	1048771	56016	5.0	Blue-eyed Chuck plays Geronimo with a very straight face . . .	There's really nothing to distinguish GERONIMO from any standard Hollywood western about outlaws , except that this time it's a lone outlaw against the U . S . cavalry at a time when Indian treaties were being broken and the Indians wanted to fight over territorial rights . Nothing complex here , just a fictionalized account of Geronimo's love for an Indian woman who bears him a son before the fadeout and after the final battle . Blond and blue-eyed CHUCK CONNORS isn't anyone's idea of an Indian so it's hard to tell what the casting director was thinking , but he does a commendable job of looking like one , thanks to make-up and costumes , except for the blue eyes . He makes no attempt at any sort of native accent but his stoic manner and steely-eyed gaze does help the characterization . KAMALA DEVI is good as the Indian woman who bears his child and ADAM WEST has a pivotal role as a sympathetic officer . Nicely photographed but short on battle skirmishes , it makes passable entertainment but is hardly an outstanding western by any yardstick , dull in some stretches with a less than inspired script .
445834	1048771	21149	5.0	Hollywood's early sound version is strictly for the birds . . .	I'm told that JOHN BARRYMORE was once a great actor . There is little evidence for this claim offered here . His entire performance has the flavor of smokehouse ham all the way , even given to over-the-top acrobatics on the ship's crows nest . He squints his eyes , widens them when angry , snarls all of his dialog in a theatrical manner , and then we're supposed to believe that a beautiful young girl ( JOAN BENNETT at twenty ) is so charmed by his dashing appearance that she falls instantly in love with him . The only impressive things about the film are the settings , the photography and the all too brief moments at sea where Captain Ahab comes into contact with the great white whale . But for a film about Melville's famous whaler , it spends very little time at sea . Most of the story is taken up by a conventional three-way romance that is pure Hollywood hokum . Bennett was a very beautiful young girl but there's a strange quality about the way she uses her voice - - " talkies " being new , this is , I suppose , forgivable . She seems to be acting in a stage play rather than a movie - - but then , so is Barrymore . Summing up : Primitive attempt to present Melville to ' 30s audiences , leaving out most of the plot , substituting motivations and adding love interest . A yawner except for the sea scenes .
447730	1048771	51744	5.0	Silly William Castle fright film is as stale as week old bread . . .	Only the kiddies could possibly find anything really scary or original about this obvious and contrived fright film on a cheapie William Castle budget , THE HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL . Despite the fact that it features VINCENT PRICE as an eccentric millionaire who challenges a flock of guests to spend the night in his haunted mansion ( and survive ) , it's got all the flavor of amateur night with performances ranging from bad to really bad . Of course , the title alone is enough to encourage some viewers to think they'll get some real scares - - but it's a title that never lives up to the promise of something really haunting . Instead , we have chandeliers crashing , heads turning up in boxes , and some foaming vat of acid bubbling in the cellar while the guests lurk around in such stupid fashion that they seem to deserve their grisly fates . Unworthy of Vincent Price , an actor who did do a number of good horror films . This is not one of them . Strictly third-rate stuff , even for Halloween .
447895	1048771	35238	6.0	Sentimental tear-jerker gives Garson and Colman ideal roles . . .	To say that RANDOM HARVEST was a highly popular success when released in 1942 is almost an understatement . It played for ten weeks at the huge Radio City Music Hall , filling it with appreciative fans who couldn't get enough of this sentimental James Hilton romance . Most of its success is due to the charisma of RONALD COLMAN and GREER GARSON , both at their absolute peak of professional charm and poise , with Colman doing a magnificent job of making the shell-shocked " Smithy " one of his most appealing characters and Garson giving one of her most radiant performances as Paula . But if you take a moment to examine the story contents , it makes you realize what an accomplishment the performances are since the story has so many flaws in realism , particularly regarding the instant falling in love that happens when Garson first discovers " Smithy " is from an asylum and then her refusal to tell him the truth for a long period of time while she patiently waits for him to get his memory back . Too patiently . The amnesia theme was a favorite of ' 40s Hollywood and it has never been used to better advantage than it is here . But the instant attraction between SUSAN PETERS and Colman when he returns to his snobbish family after an auto accident that makes him forget Paula , seems a contrivance that doesn't ring true . Nor do the subtle clues that bring his memory back seem reasonable enough to swallow . However , the moment when she realizes he is still thinking of another , is brilliantly handled by both Peters and Colman . Nevertheless , all of the schmaltz has been so skillfully directed by Mervyn LeRoy that most will fall under the spell of the film's unrelenting romanticism and let cynicism fade . That's just as well , because LeRoy's direction is slow-paced at times , almost cumbersome , letting the film run to an inordinate length before letting " Smithy " and Paula get together for a final embrace while cherry blossoms fall and the music swells to an appropriate volume for " The End " . I don't rank this film as high as WATERLOO BRIDGE or TO EACH HIS OWN , both romances that skillfully told a tale without resorting to the glossy romantic close-ups and violin music that " Harvest " uses to accentuate the chemistry of Colman and Garson - - a distinctly MGM trait . But they do have enormous chemistry and that is the factor that makes the whole unbelievable story work .
447344	1048771	26264	6.0	Merle is effective in a weepie from the Golden Age . . .	Handsomely photographed and nicely scored romantic drama from Samuel Goldwyn about a childhood friendship between three people that develops into an intense romantic triangle . MERLE OBERON , FREDRIC MARCH and HERBERT MARSHALL have the pivotal roles as star-crossed lovers during the World War I period . Unfortunately , the three leads are lifelong friends destined to have their lives shattered by the war . Love , guilt and fate play a part in their lives when March is blinded but keeps away from Oberon , unable to tell her the truth and letting her think he's died . As for the rest of the plot , with a screenplay by Lillian Hellman , you have to watch the film . Nobody stumbles in any of the roles and , in fact , MERLE OBERON won her only Best Actress nomination as Kitty , warm and appealing as the romantic interest of both men . The tearful final reunion scene will remind you of the final touching scene from RANDOM HARVEST where Smitty and his lost love find each other again . Modern viewers beware . You'll probably find some of the tear-jerking moments a bit too mawkish but remember , this was the 1930s . Trivia note : Oberon was photographed much more flatteringly in another film she appeared in that year , THE SCARLET PIMPERNELL . What a difference a more flattering hairdo and period costumes make ! !
447686	1048771	382625	6.0	Pulp fiction . . . ordinary thriller given too much attention because of controversial theme . . .	If you approach watching a film like THE DA VINCI CODE as a thriller ( and forget all the mumble jumble about the history of the Roman Catholic Church ) , it works on an elementary level . The background score ( a very busy one ) by Hans Zimmer gives it the required element of suspense even when two characters are merely giving you a lot of exposition to make the plot easier to follow . Unfortunately , it would take someone more familiar with this material to truly enjoy the movie as a serious look at the dark side of Christianity and its symbols that never quite make complete sense . And so , I will review the film on the level of a thriller that has added a controversial theme to attract a large audience ready to put on its thinking cap and at least ponder what might have been . Ron Howard has seen to it that the controversial elements have been toned down considerably from the book , without eliminating them entirely . But on the debit side , most of the photography is too dark ( intentionally so , I presume to keep an air of mystery going ) , the explanations come at a slow pace but there are too many to keep the plot from moving forward the way it should in a thriller of this kind , and the acting is , for the most part , not extraordinary . TOM HANKS gives a very understated performance in a role that is , for the most part , rather bland . He plays the role straight , without any emphasis on his lighter side , but one almost wishes for some trace of wit or humor in the role . His French cohort AUDREY TAUTOU has an accent that makes some of her key words undecipherable ( at least to me ) in a film where every bit of relevant material needs to be handed to the viewer who wants to catch all the clues . Only Ian McKellen sparkles in a supporting role , bringing flashes of humor and intelligence to a well-written role . Alfred Molina as a Bishop has little opportunity to be more than slightly interesting . The most striking and intense supporting role goes to Paul Bettany as Silas , the albino who has his own interpretation of what he must do to please the Lord . He has a few masochistic scenes that dole out the required chills and he has a look of quiet menace and desperation in his eyes . All in all , I'd say this should please readers of the book . Howard has done as good a job as possible with the bulky twists and turns of the novel and translated a popular work of pulp fiction into a movie that will undoubtedly be seen by audiences looking for a summer blockbuster . Summing up : A good workmanlike job by a movie that really doesn't ask the viewer to take it too seriously . It's more like an espionage thriller with a dose of religiosity thrown in .
447657	1048771	91167	6.0	Vignettes in search of a plot . . . typical Allen fluff . . .	HANNAH AND HER SISTERS is a series of vignettes about family relationships - - successful in some ways , overly familiar when Woody Allen gets into his hypochondriac spin . Handsome photography of New York City , fashionable interiors and exteriors and a cast of pros , makes it all easy enough to take - - although I was never a fan of his interior and overlapping dialog which gets to be distracting enough without the undertone of music blasting away on the soundtrack . The MICHAEL CAINE / BARBARA HERSHEY romance is nicely sketched and played in a natural manner by both stars who share common interests although she's happily married to MAX VON SYDOW . MIA FARROW is an actress who loves to surround herself with family and friends at the dinner table rather than concentrate solely on an acting career as a stage actress . Not a big stretch for her - - with art imitating life . It's the kind of Allen film that has Woody and his technique written all over it . If that's your kind of thing , you'll like it , regardless of the fact that it's , at heart , very light stuff and rather insignificant . The flaws are well hidden by lots of good music on the soundtrack and occasional flashes of humor in Woody's doctor visits resulting in his interior dialogs wrestling with his latest X-rays . " Don't panic . Don't panic , " he tells himself before resorting to - - you guessed it - - panic . His quest for religious faith is also good for a few chuckles . It goes on and on in a rather disjointed manner - - again , typical Allen style - - but fans of his films should find this one a bit more likable than most of those he did in the ' 80s - - and the cast is pleasant enough to watch despite the familiarity of it all , with MIA FARROW essentially playing herself . DIANNE WIEST is the daffy sister struggling to express her talent either in the theater or in her writing and has some amusing scenes with Woody as he comes to appreciate her . But , in the end , none of it really makes much of an impression so it's hard to justify the awards and nominations . Must have been a bad year .
447425	1048771	38917	6.0	Richard Dix takes on another role in " The Whistler " series . . .	A neat entry from the series has RICHARD DIX playing a man who wants to get rid of his wife for a younger woman ( LESLIE BROOKS ) . What he doesn't know is that his wife learns about his affair with the young blonde model and is recording her thoughts in a diary . When his wife dies , he does marry again - - but has to play a cat-and-mouse game with his new wife when she begins to suspect him of murder . Dix plays his role quite effectively and Leslie Brooks is stunning as the blonde beauty . She never had a better chance than she does here , but unfortunately Columbia was never able to find anything but supporting roles for her in B-films of the period . Suspenseful , it takes awhile before the tense proceedings start to tighten up , but it's worth ending for the good finale . MICHAEL DUANE has a small supporting role as an artist but gets star billing . Well directed by George Sherman , these series are better than average programmers .
447467	1048771	43827	6.0	Where is Dorothy Lamour when you need her ? . . .	HEDY LAMARR may have been one of BOB HOPE's most glamorous co-stars , but she lacks the sort of comic timing needed for any female who plays opposite the hyper-active Hope . She never loses her poise no matter how ridiculous the situations are , but she never looks at home in this kind of spy story that even has her doing a nightclub act - - singing the kind of sultry song that Dorothy Lamour could always put over . It's in the nightclub scene that she looks most uncomfortable as a performer , obviously dubbed by a real singer . The story itself is the kind of mistaken identity thing that either Hope or Danny Kaye had done many times before and there's nothing new in the way of original material . It's a pleasant enough spoof of spy stories about a cowardly impostor ( Hope ) assigned by the government to obtain a top secret microfilm from spies in Tangier . Hope is his usual cowardly self and has to be prodded by the contact man ( ARNOLD MOSS ) to carry out the assignment , which he is more than willing to do once he meets the alluring Lamarr . This was part of Hedy's deal with Paramount to give them another film after SAMSON AND DELILAH - - and there's even a bit of Victor Young's " Samson and Delilah " theme played by the orchestra in the nightclub scene . Hope , who has all the best lines , plays the impostor with his usual comic finesse and gets away with varying amounts of mugging whenever the script isn't funny enough . Hedy tries valiantly to keep up with him , but she's just a little too restrained to make her efforts seem casual and effortless - - as they should . The screwball slapstick for the finale keeps things rushing along toward the predictable conclusion , but it's the sort of average entertainment that pleased Hope's fans who enjoyed his comic energy in this sort of espionage romp from time to time .
447517	1048771	112667	6.0	Sweetly sentimental as a Hallmark card . . . but well done . . .	This is a handsomely produced tear-jerker , nicely played by MAUREEN O'HARA , RICHARD THOMAS and ANNETTE O'TOOLE and obviously aimed toward the Christmas market with a sweet tale about a mysterious Christmas BOX residing in the attic of an old lady's mansion . Maureen O'Hara is still a pleasure to look at and listen to in the role of a rather crotchety , firm-minded elderly lady who is in need of household help and accepts Thomas and O'Toole , along with their young daughter , when they apply for the job . Thomas needs the extra money to run a ski shop but is not exactly fond of O'Hara and her ways . It's his daughter , Jenna , who eventually does establish a bond with the woman and more revelations soon come about with respect to the mysterious Christmas box in the attic and O'Hara's past . It's strictly sentimental stuff , so be advised that the pace is on the slow side as the character revelations are gradually made clear . But if you like warm-hearted tales of Christmas ( or any of the holidays for that matter ) , you can't go wrong with this one . Summing up : Handsomely produced with fine performances , well worth viewing .
447658	1048771	368891	6.0	The Da Vinci Code in a minor key . . . more humor , more fun . . .	If your head is still spinning from all the murky codes being deciphered in THE DA VINCI CODE , you can sit back and relax with all the clues NICHOLAS CAGE has to unravel in order to go on his treasure hunt in NATIONAL TREASURE . He has lots of help from his dad ( JON VOIGT ) , a very savvy female assistant ( DIANE KRUGER ) , his mentor ( CHRISTOPHER PLUMMER ) , and his goofy but handsome side-kick ( JUSTIN BARTHA ) . The heist scenes involving a stolen Declaration of Indpendence are a highlight of the film , all filmed on actual locales in and around Washington , D . C . and Philadelphia , handsomely photographed . Cage gets some stiff resistance from HARVEY KEITEL as a no-nonsense FBI man , and some villainous competition from greedy SEAN BEAN and his henchmen , who want the treasure for monetary purposes only and will stop at nothing , even murder , to lay their greedy hands on it . It's all Saturday matinée stuff , the plot strictly a mixture of Indiana Jones and other cliffhanger stories where the hero has to pursue his quest while all sorts of obstacles are thrust in his way - - and then the final , climactic shoot-out and wild chase before he can walk off with the girl at the end of the movie . All the standard clichés are firmly in place , but it's still a lot of fun to watch NICHOLAS CAGE interact with a fun loving cast . SEAN BEAN lends some British dignity to his role as the charming villain , not quite as dark a villain as is usual in these sort of capers . There's a light touch throughout all the heist sequences and chases and explorations of the underground caverns holding the treasure , as well as some well staged moments of suspense with collapsing stairways and termite-ridden wooden structures making the search perilous . JUSTIN BARTHA contributes a lot of the lighter jibes as a computer wiz who is clearly having a good time and knows the whole thing is a lark as he works on his computer graphics . Nothing too original here , but it's purely an escapist adventure yarn .
445299	1048771	39441	6.0	Standard Randolph Scott film should have kept Zane Grey's original title . . .	GUNFIGHTERS is the unoriginal title for Zane Grey's " Twin Sombreros " , which , considering the story is about two sisters who are almost twin-like in appearance , would have been a more apt title for this film . The story is routine as depicted here , with bad guy BRUCE CABOT as the man responsible for a few killings over range rights on property owned by GRIFF BARNETT and his daughters BARBARA BRITTON and DOROTHY HART . RANDOLPH SCOTT is the man who rides into town at the start without his gunbelt , but by the end of the story he dons it for the final gun duel before tossing it off again and heading west for the happy ending . This is after he's fought a couple of the town bullies , including FORREST TUCKER , and won . What surprised me was how good the warm tones of Cinecolor looked , while not quite up to the standard of three-strip Technicolor . Looks as though Columbia was aiming to give the film an A-budget look . For Randolph Scott fans , it's a treat to see him in fine shape - - but the script is ordinary and the direction is uninspired . One would never guess the story is from an original penned by Zane Grey .
447720	1048771	25601	6.0	Grace Moore's Oscar-nominated role in very dated musical . . .	Unlike MGM's favorite soprano , JEANETTE MacDONALD , other singers from the Met tried screen careers at various times in the ' 30s , but none emerged winning enough as screen personalities to rival Jeanette . Columbia tried hard with GRACE MOORE and this is undoubtedly one of her better efforts at attaining screen stardom . TULLIO CARMINATI is amusingly persistent as her demanding voice coach who discovers her singing " Ciribiribin " in a cellar cafe before offering to become her tutor . LYLE TALBOT is her boyfriend with marriage on his mind . But the silly script has Miss Moore acting like a spoiled prima donna , cavorting with boyfriend Talbot while supposedly training for her big moment as " Carmen " . A series of misunderstandings involving another woman , MONA BARRIE ( strongly resembling Kay Francis ) , makes up much of the backstage part of the story and only weakens the overall film . Moore is fine whenever she's singing but the lip synch is way off during the final " Un Bel Di " and it's hard to see where her performance earned her an Oscar nomination for the acting part of her role . Summing up : A disappointment for me , regardless of glowing tributes from the other commentators on this particular film .
445284	1048771	57007	6.0	Notable only for all the local Hawaian scenery . . . a disappointment otherwise . . .	Perhaps the kind of role JOHN WAYNE should have taken a bit earlier in his career . The age difference between him and ELIZABETH ALLEN is really noticeably distracting here , but their constant squabbling and ribbing each other is pleasing enough to make the slight story entertaining - - at least for John Ford's staunchest fans . Otherwise , it's a case of scenery taking center stage over the actors for a picture postcard view of Hawaii . Aside from Wayne and Allen , none of the other principals have too much to do - - particularly DOROTHY LAMOUR who merely makes a few fleeting appearances wearing a sarong-like garment as in days of yore . Nor does LEE MARVIN get a real chance to play a substantial enough role . Ford lets his cast brawl with realistic fistfights and lots of physical stunts that must have kept an army of stuntmen on hand for some of the dirty work . CEASAR ROMERO is pleasant in a supporting role and JACK WARDEN , as Allen's father , injects humor into his character . Miss Allen is a surprise as the leading lady - - the aristocratic Boston society lady in stiff opposition to Mr . Wayne's brusque manners and brawling ways . She , of course , eventually melts and sees thing differently after she's been around awhile . Although her performance is fine , it's interesting to note that right after this film , she went back to a career consisting mostly of TV roles . Very lightweight entertainment that depends on its gorgeous scenery to keep you awake and interested . Certainly not the best of Ford .
447631	1048771	256611	6.0	A look at the variety of settings offered by California . . .	A typical James A . FitzPatrick " TravelTalk " illustrates how much variety there is in California , which is why it can be used for so many settings by Hollywood's filmmakers . We glimpse sand dunes stretching across the desert and now traversed by a modern highway ; vineyards as a result of irrigation that produces a large portion of the world's grapes ; date trees that provide sheltering palms ; the City Hall area of Beverly Hills ; Spanish and English architecture ; ranches in open country , especially one owned by Leo Carrillo , Spanish character actor ; and finally a look at Chinatown and its many tourist shops , as well as a Mexican street near the border where we see a man working on vases at a potter's wheel . The brief tour is over before you know it but it does give an indication of the variety of the terrain in California .
447999	1048771	194830	6.0	Promotional film to create interest in the feature film . . .	Warner Bros . spent such a lavish budget on their production of Shakespeare's A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM that they went all out to market it to audiences not accustomed to viewing anything quite so literary , especially from the studio that featured mostly crime melodramas with stars like Cagney and Edward G . Robinson . So they created a short movie that would acquaint movie-goers with cast members of the film talking briefly about their participation . Among the cast members : JAMES CAGNEY , DICK POWELL , OLIVIA DE HAVILLAND , MICKEY ROONEY , ARTHUR TREACHER , VICTOR JORY , ANITA LOUISE and many other contract players . There's a certain old-fashioned charm to this style of promoting a film and it's certainly interesting to see these actors talking about their roles and their high expectations for the film's success . Apparently it worked . While not a great financial success , the film did win some critical approval and ended up with an Oscar nomination for Best Picture . Warners did the same thing the following year with ANTHONY ADVERSE , again presenting a promotional feature that had the various actors / actresses talking about their roles in the film .
445975	1048771	252299	6.0	When boredom in the U . S . Army careens out of control . . .	JOAQUIN PHOENIX stars in this independent feature that was denied distribution in the U . S . shortly after happened since it's a rather anti-military look at shenanigans among enlisted men at a U . S . Army camp in the peacetime Germany of 1989 . Phoenix is an army corporal involved in a lot heavier black market stuff than Sgt . Bilko ever was , and to call this a comedy is rather a stretch , although there are patches of dark humor in what some here are calling a black comedy . The comedy is strictly in some of the situations which get totally out of control when boredom sets in and the soldiers get drunk while on duty during maneuvers with a tank . The first half has some amusing incidents but once the new top Sgt . Lee takes over from the clueless Col . Berman , things take a darker turn . It seems the corporal has been deliberately tweaking Sgt . Lee by dating Lee's daughter right under his nose . This is where the film changes course as Lee decides to wreak revenge on the corporal in the most humiliating ways , even ordering a daybreak target practice to destroy the corporal's luxurious car . It's the heroin operation that seems really contrived with all sorts of mayhem breaking out when various factions are pitted against each other . A blazing fireworks of a climax has Phoenix and SCOTT GLENN engaged in a life and death struggle that leads to the film's rather ironic ending that lets us know that Phoenix will continue his thieving ways in the army under a new commanding officer . Not bad , but really not a flattering glimpse of U . S . Army life . There are some laughable moments but the latter half of the film is distinctly geared toward the dark side . Phoenix plays it straight all the way through , charming enough in a rascally sort of way but never giving the material the light touch that it seems to need . As Leonard Maltin observed : " Not bad as black comedy . . . but grows increasingly unpleasant as story unfolds . "
447941	1048771	39757	6.0	Edward G . Robinson in another psychotic role . . . Rozsa's music helps . . .	There's a very creepy atmosphere in THE RED HOUSE and although the film is rather slow in getting its story started , beginning as it does in rustic daylight scenes , the mood soon changes - - as does Miklos Rozsa's evocative background music - - and we know we're in for a psychological suspense tale grounded in the usual film noir ingredients . Robinson is a man hiding a secret - - and when he becomes violently upset when someone suggests taking a short cut through the woods near The Red House - - it's only a matter of time before all the focus of the film becomes drawn to the house and whatever secrets it hides . His daughter Meg ( ALLENE ROBERTS ) is attracted to a young man who comes to work on the farm ( LON McCALLISTER ) and it's he who first suggests taking a short cut . Curiosity gets the best of the girl and her suitor and before long the story takes a number of unexpected twists and turns . JUDITH ANDERSON lends her impressive presence to the role of Robinson's wife and Rory Calhoun and Julie London ( who later had quite a bit of success as a pop singer ) are competent enough in supporting roles . But most of the credit for the success of the film in creating the proper mood goes to Robinson , who is excellent here , and to composer Miklos Rozsa who delivers a superb background score that heightens the melodrama .
446083	1048771	39748	6.0	Unknown film noir is definitely worth catching . . .	After watching RAILROADED , I'm convinced JOHN IRELAND could have taken his place alongside men like ROBERT MITCHUM doing grim little film noirs during the ' 40s . He's excellent as a tight-lipped gangster with a scowling expression as he methodically kills anyone double-crossing him or standing in his way . He knocks around his blonde girlfriend ( JANE RANDOLPH ) with woman-hating contempt and fires bullets with casual lack of concern for fatalities . In short , he makes an ideal film noir anti-hero . HUGH BEAUMONT , known by most fans principally as Beaver's dad on TV , is only lukewarm as the detective who falls for SHIELAH RYAN and decides to help her track down the killer after Ireland frames her kid brother ( ED KELLY ) for the murder of a policeman . Their final fade-out kiss looks a little clumsy but - - hey , the accent is on crime and action , not romance . Anthony Mann does the best he can with a low-budget crime melodrama and turns it into a taut , well-made , shadowy film noir with Ireland showing his stuff as a ruthless gangster . Summing up : Brisk and entertaining , it's well worth watching for fans of this genre .
445950	1048771	29659	6.0	The skating queen meets The Prince . . .	SONJA HENIE was always lucky that Zanuck ( at Fox ) had the good sense to surround her with capable talent so that the film wouldn't depend on her ability to skate , smile dazzlingly ( like a dimpled darling ) , and say as little as possible so her Norwegian accent wouldn't be too hard for Americans to take . Here , he surrounds her with JOAN DAVIS , MELVILLE COOPER , ARTHUR TREACHER , ALAN HALE and SIG RUMAN who keep the tale spinning even though it's the usual boy-meets-girl one that's full of the usual misunderstandings . And for added insurance , Zanuck gave in to Sonja's demands that TYRONE POWER be her male co-star . She and Power were quite an item at the time , although it was rumored that Power was just using her to get one step up on the ladder of success . She was reportedly devastated when he went off in another direction and married Annabella . Sonja does some pleasing routines on ice and Joan Davis is a daffy orchestra leader who occasionally sings a wacky song number - - so , it's all pretty much the kind of thing audiences wanted from a Sonja Henie movie . But the best was still to come : SUN VALLEY SERENADE in 1941 .
445646	1048771	40107	6.0	Harmless little musical to watch on a rainy day . . .	Jack Carson and Ann Sothern are such capable professionals that even when they are cast in something like APRIL SHOWERS they are worth watching . Carson rarely got leading roles , except in the " B " film or programmer such as this one and Ann Sotheran was just winding up all of her " Maisie " roles at MGM to do this unpretentious little musical at Warner Bros . Together they're fun to watch as a married couple , a pair of show biz hoofers who give out with a song and dance patter when they're not having domestic troubles over the legitimacy of using an underage boy ( their son ) in their vaudeville act . It's all done in a formula way with no big surprises , no characters that are more than conventional and without the kind of production numbers that studios like Fox and MGM gave their musicals . And yet , with a nice balance between some serious drama and mostly lightweight singing and dancing , it's the kind of musical that's easy to take . The usual supporting players under contract at Warner Bros . are used to fill out the supporting roles , including Robert Alda and S . Z . Sakall . Carson and Sothern are both capable enough to make us believe this sort of thing could easily have happened and both of them have a nice way with a song and dance . Little Robert Ellis is very adept as their talented youngster . Summing up : A nice , unpretentious little film to watch on a rainy day .
446835	1048771	40104	6.0	Charming little comedy worth warming up to . . .	JEANNE CRAIN was at the height of her appeal as a demure charmer at Fox , just beginning to be more than a pretty face as far as her acting career was concerned . And here she had two splendid co-stars : WILLIAM HOLDEN as her ex-G . I . hubby and EDMUND GWENN as a little retired professor who has some housing space in his attic . When Crain finds out about the available space ( during the big housing shortage at the time ) , she convinces Gwenn to rent the apartment to the young married couple . From there , the plot takes a few steps beyond that bare outline , always throwing a positive outlook at women who want to better themselves with an education as well as the G . I . s entitled to do so under the G . I . bill . Gene Lockhart , Griff Barnett and Betty Lynn fill the supporting roles amiably and it's probably Jeanne Crain's best film of that period , following her enormous success as MARGIE two years previously .
446922	1048771	29606	6.0	Notable mainly for March's great performance but inferior to the Garland remake . . .	Sorry , but I can't get on the bandwagon here of glowing adjectives to describe A STAR IS BORN with mousy Janet Gaynor in the Esther Blodgett role - - a girl swept into big time stardom by a man whose own career is on the descent . FREDRIC MARCH plays the alcoholic Norman Maine ( modeled after someone like John Barrymore ) who meets Gaynor at a party , is presumably dazzled by her enough to get her a screen test , and that's how the career of Esther Blodgett starts . This would make sense if Gaynor had the sort of charm and personality suggesting she could be turned into a major star and win an Academy Award . Gaynor's screen persona here is dull and naive . Period . But somehow , that doesn't matter as much as it should because all the other characters are much better realized . The second half of the movie builds up some dramatic intensity completely missing in the dreary first half . And for some reason , the Technicolor improves as the film goes on . The interior scenes in the first half are darkly lit and look like primitive use of color . The touching ending is well handled , but I can't believe Janet Gaynor in the role of a girl whose talent is so arresting that she immediately is scooped up into the frenzy of film-making . The role should have been played by a girl in her early twenties who looks the part and has the out-sized talent needed to convince us she could be molded into a star of Vicki Lester proportions . Summing up : Disappointing , especially when compared to the Garland / Mason version , but worthwhile for Fredric March's performance as Norman Maine .
445227	1048771	82495	6.0	Haddonfield hospital is under attack . . . Michael is back . . .	A very respectable sequel , surprisingly enough , in an age where most sequels fail to capture the spirit of the original . The gore has been made a little more graphic , the scene has shifted to the hospital where Laurie was taken after the attack at her home , and everything moves in proper horror movie form under a different director but with the same nerve-jangling music that provided goosebumps in the original . JAMIE LEE CURTIS reprises her role as the hapless victim who shows spunk and courage even when she sees others around her being viciously attacked by Michael Myers and DONALD PLEASENCE is more determined than ever to capture the raving lunatic hellbent on turning Haddonfield Hospital into one large morgue . It's all strictly in keeping with the logic ( or lack of it ) that inspired the original , with the man in the mask more visible this time which makes some of the scenes even more scary . Dr . Loomis gets caught in a fiery explosion of fire at the climax , which makes us wonder whether he'll reappear for the next installment or not . There are those who think the film has a better pace than the first HALLOWEEN .
446719	1048771	74937	6.0	Neil Simon's parody of murder mysteries with top cast . . .	With PETER FALK doing a superb turn as Sam Diamond ( a Raymond Chandler type of detective with Humphrey Bogart characteristics ) , and EILEEN BRENNAN as his moll , quick with the humorous sarcasm , this is a clever parody of every murder mystery ever written . In fact , everyone concerned with this Neil Simon parody is having fun in their offbeat roles . Most offbeat of all is NANCY WALKER as a ditzy mute maid and ALEC GUINESS as a blind servant - - and , unfortunately , TRUMAN CAPOTE as Lionel Twain , the host of a dinner party designed to trap a murderer . Too bad Philip Seymour Hoffman wasn't around at the time to do justice to Capote's embarrassingly bad interpretation of Twain who , despite all the Capote mannerisms , seems stilted and unrehearsed . David NIVEN and MAGGIE SMITH do wonders as a Nick and Nora type of couple , ELSA LANCHESTER is eccentric as Miss Marbles , and JAMES COCO has fun with his interpretation of a Belgian detective modeled after Hercule Poirot . All the requisites for mystery are present : the thunder and lightning , the heavy rains , the dark old house , the group of dinner guest suspects , and a plot that gets sillier with each scene . True , there's a bit of a letdown at the revelation of the killer , but it's all done with such high spirits and witty lines that you won't care much about that . Delicious parody of all those who-dun-its we all grew up on , stylishly directed by newcomer Robert Moore .
445772	1048771	36208	6.0	Screwball comedy has MacMurray and Colbert floundering in mud . . .	Physical comedy of the kind we call screwball is evident throughout NO TIME FOR LOVE where Claudette Colbert and Fred MacMurray play a couple from opposite social circles . She's a magazine photographer , he's a sandhog working in a tunnel beneath the Hudson River . She's attracted to him at first sight but doesn't seem to know it - - and we know he's going to fall for her after a bunch of mishaps happen . The mishaps are piled one on top of another in typical screwball fashion with nobody making much sense . Certainly MacMurray's character is about as obnoxious and arrogant as any leading man Colbert was ever set up against , and she acts pretty irresponsibly in that tunnel where she gets up to her neck in trouble and mud - - lots of mud . But somehow , it's all very watchable with a cast that knows exactly how to play this sort of thing . Claude Binyon had a way with writing slight romantic comedies and he gives Colbert and MacMurray some bright lines to work with . Others fortunate enough to get some good moments are Richard Haydn , Ilka Chase , June Havoc and Rod Cameron . If you look closely you can spot Tom Neal in the background as one of the sandhogs . It doesn't make a lot of sense when you stop to think about it , but it's fun while it lasts , thanks mainly to MacMurray and Colbert who can do this kind of romp effortlessly . Funniest bit : As MacMurray exits in final scene carrying Colbert like a caveman over his back , Richard Haydn says : " I'll drop by for supper tomorrow night . " " Not tomorrow night , " says Colbert . Wink . Wink .
447242	1048771	29442	6.0	Old-fashioned swashbuckler is still a rollicking good time for all . . .	The only ingredient missing in THE PRISONER OF ZENDA ( ' 37 ) is Technicolor , but it's masterfully photographed by James Wong Howe in glorious B & W and the cast is exceptionally fine . The story is the familiar one about a man forced to masquerade as a King of a fictional country ( Ruritania ) while all sorts of intrigue and cunning schemes are going on at the palace . RONALD COLMAN has the central role and MADELEINE CARROLL is the gorgeous aristocratic Princess Flavia that he falls in love with . Produced in lavish style by David O . Selznick , with stirring music by Alfred Newman and directed by John Cromwell , it's the sort of escapist entertainment audiences needed then - - and now . DOUGLAS FAIRBANKS , JR . plays the wicked Rupert of Hentzau with devilish charm , the man who is in on an audacious plan to hold the real King Rupert hostage for ransom , and RAYMOND MASSEY does his usual villainous turn as Michael , the prisoner of Zenda's brother , the man who wants the throne for himself . In a small role as Massey's wife , MARY ASTOR makes almost no impression at all . On the debit side , there's a strictly 1930's storybook flavor to the way the story is told , particularly the love scenes between Colman and Carroll . Their histrionics get a little too over-heated during that final scene during which her nobility in willing to forget " a moment of madness " seems more like a story contrivance . True love never does run smooth , not here and not in Shakespeare . The duel between Colman and Fairbanks is well staged and makes an exciting finale for a slow-paced tale that becomes a bit too talky at times . Still , despite obvious drawbacks , it's an entertaining story told with a dashing amount of romance and intrigue . Madeleine Carroll was never more beautiful .
445609	1048771	129167	6.0	Succeeds brilliantly as entertainment . . . fine animation . . .	There was a preoccupation with paranoia about invasion from aliens that permeated all the science fiction in the ' 50s . This story builds on that fear by giving us an E . T . sort of encounter with an alien , in this case a super-sized piece of metal called THE IRON GIANT , who is saved from extinction by a little boy who pulls the " Off " switch when it appears the Giant is about to be electrocuted . It's stunning right from the opening scenes , animated with fresh originality and voiced by some expert actors ( HARRY CONNICK , JR . , VAN DIESEL , CLORIS LEACHMAN and the little boy voiced by ELI MARIENTHAL ) . Not only is the story engrossing , but there's a humanization of " the creature from outer space " that defies description . The animators manage to make his thought process apparent with minimal dialog and you can really feel for his emotions when he is asked to perform a noble act ( at the climax ) in order to save mankind from a fate worse than death . There's an effective background score by Michael Kamen , without the songs that seem to irritate some devotees of animated films , and it moves briskly at a pleasing pace that should keep young and old riveted to the sometimes magical events . Briskly entertaining and well worth watching - - among the best of the animated films based on pure fantasy . The very expert voice-overs make the characters seem amazingly real .
445840	1048771	906049	6.0	Sumptuous looking version of the " Bertram " story with interesting changes . . .	On one point I have to agree - - that the sound quality ( especially for the dialog ) needed improvement . But I found a solution for this whenever I watch a British-made film . I use the CAPTION FEATURE on my remote . Works every time . I never have to miss a word of plot and when watching a mystery , this is very important . I could toss the same complaint at GOSFORD PARK , the Robert Altman film that had so much cockney dialog and busy music score in the background that I couldn't understand a thing when I didn't use the caption feature . But putting aside the hearing complaint , AT BERTAM'S HOTEL was a fascinating story , even with the added twists and added characters , and not hard to follow at all . I think the screenwriter did an excellent job of putting some nice touches on the original Agatha Christie story . I wish , in fact , that he'd been the writer who did the updated version of MURDER IS EASY ( ' 82 ) ( with Helen Hayes and Olivia de Havilland in cameo roles ) . That was scripted by Carmen Culver who made a mess of updating it . Too bad Tom MacRae wasn't available then . GERTRUDE McEWEN does a nice job as Jane Marple , but I confess I thought Jean Hickson was the best of all the Miss Marples . You could actually see those little gray cells working when the camera caught her face in pensive close-ups . The settings are opulent , the mystery is a clever one , the cast of players are extremely talented and , aside from the changes that were made adding or changing certain characters to the story , AT BERTRAM'S HOTEL still makes fascinating viewing . Summing up : Just remember to use that CAPTION feature on your remote if you're lucky enough to have bought a set that includes it .
446684	1048771	129387	6.0	Something about weirdos that'll have you laughing so hard that it hurts . . .	THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY that has every man in the film falling for her ( sometimes literally ) in a comedy that moves along with gay abandon and no shortage of slapstick silliness . Mary is played with breezy style by CAMERON DIAZ ( a throwback perhaps to Carole Lombard's wackiness in this sort of thing ) , and , of course , BEN STILLER gets to play the lovesick fool who ruins his first prom date with her by getting stung by his zipper . There are too many sight gags here to enumerate , but the funniest have to do with Mary's dog and the other is the famous scene where hair-gel takes on a new meaning . MATT DILLON is the sleazy friend who agrees to find the missing Mary after many years have separated Stiller and Diaz , only to find that he's instantly in love with her too . Naturally , he tells Stiller that she's turned into a blimp in a wheelchair - - and you can predict that when Stiller finds out the truth there will be hell to pay . Hilarious moments dominate the breezy comedy from the Farrelly Brothers , full of visual and verbal gags that are non-stop until the last moment . By all means , worth seeing unless you're completely grossed out by this type of humor .
447741	1048771	421715	6.0	Long , long movie from short F . Scott Fitzgerald story . . .	THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON is only half successful . First of all , if there are any Oscars to give out here it's got to be for whomever did the miraculous make-up jobs . Technical awards category might give this one a few Oscars for visual effects and cinematography . And the music by Alexandre Desplat is gorgeous . But the story is a ponderous one , something about the time warp that occurs if a person ages backwards and keeps getting younger than all his contemporaries - - but as fascinating as that concept might be , it takes a much better grip on fantasy to work for a movie that runs two hours and forty-seven minutes . Frankly , there isn't enough of a story here to sustain such a lengthy film . How many of us have to worry about getting younger each year , so where's the connection ? And towards the middle , it really starts to sag , despite some good performances from a first-rate cast performing brilliantly under Bryan Singer's direction . BRAD PITT has certainly chosen an unusual role to play and he does it with his customary capabilities intact . CATE BLANCHETT is outstanding as Daisy , the childhood sweetheart who grows up to be the love of his life , but her motivations are sometimes vague and her character is sometimes irritating . Most interesting supporting roles are well played by TARAJI P . HENSON as Queenie who finds the foundling Benjamin and raises him as her own , and JASON FLEMYNG as the boy's wayward father who abandons the baby . The biggest hurdle for BENJAMIN BUTTON to jump is making the story seem credible , as fantastic as the concept is . But since the concept istelf isn't grounded in any sort of reality , it's too big a leap to make . Should find its special target audience in fans who love the arty type of flick , no matter how slow moving the story may be . But in the end , it's all rather meaningless . After all , is anybody else in the world going to have Benjamin's unique problem ? Only in the movies - - or if your name is Dorian Gray .
447735	1048771	350811	6.0	Stylish , handsomely produced thriller using Stephen King characters . . .	Using the Stephen King characters from " Rose Red , " THE DIARY OF ELLEN RIMBAUER is a prequel to that little saga of a monstrous house that seems to be devouring its victims . This version of the Rose Red story is handsomely photographed and well acted but suffers from a script that never really bothers to explain anything . The viewer is left pondering plot details up until the very end , when again there is a letdown of even more ambiguity . Nevertheless , it manages to impress with the performances , the settings , the costumes and the plot itself is a mixed bag of so many thrillers from the past , even including the more genteel JANE EYRE or any of the Victorian novels that dealt with a house of dark decay and a sinister leading man . STEVEN BRAND is the darkly handsome head of the household whose soul is corrupted by carnal desires , an unfaithful man who brings his bride LISA BRENNER to live in Rose Red , where she is gradually subjected to all sorts of vague fears and terrors and things that go bump in the night . It's really silly stuff , not to be taken seriously , but does give rise to some goosebumps once in awhile . Eventually , the murky plot just gets muddier and all of the elements mesh into one big , slow-paced thriller that is efficient enough to produce a few chills but too ambiguous for its own good .
447391	1048771	335563	6.0	After the fall as a porn star . . . drugs , death and lots of gore . . .	Although there are a number of flashback techniques used throughout WONDERLAND , they never become too confusing , which must be some sort of tribute to writer / director James Cox . But make no mistake about it , this is a dark story of the infamous porn star John Holmes ( VAL KILMER ) and how he becomes a drug addict who becomes mixed up in a murder of retribution that was one of the most brutal murders police in L . A . had ever seen . KILMER does a thoroughly convincing job as the addicted porn star and those around him are equally effective . Dylan McDERMOTT stands out as a member of the party animal gang that tells his version of the story to the police , followed by Kilmer's . LISA KUDROW as Holme's wife comes across as the only decent character in the story and with enough backbone and grit to deal with the situation she finds herself in . KATE BOSWORTH as the simple-minded girlfriend who dotes on Kilmer , is convincing but not very likable . ERIC BOGOSIAN is excellent as Nash , the wealthy man at the center of the robbery that leads to the murderous rampage that follows . It's a chilling look at the bleak lives of these losers and photographed with gritty realism in the L . A . scene of the ' 80s . Not as powerful as films like L . A . CONFIDENTIAL , but certainly a cut above the usual crime thriller dealing with an actual event . And despite all those flashbacks , holds interest from start to finish .
445730	1048771	35957	6.0	Gripping war film was another morale booster during World War II . . .	Like BATAAN and WAKE ISLAND , GUADALCANAL DIARY is another of the many gripping war films that captured attention during WWII , complete with narration by Reed Hadley as the war correspondent telling the story of how U . S . Marines fought and died at Guadalcanal . At first , the marines met no resistance since the Japanese had scattered , but soon the battles became fierce and the war drama deepens . A stalwart cast of players gives life to the many characters , some stereotypes to be sure , but vivid , nonetheless . Interesting how RICHARD JAECKEL managed to be in just about every war film ever made during the ' 40s and well into future decades , still keeping his fresh-faced appeal as a baby-faced Marine . PRESTON FOSTER is the leader here , filling the sort of role usually held by Brian Donlevy , and the assorted cast members include ANTHONY QUINN , LLOYD NOLAN , RICHARD CONTE , RALPH BYRD and the ever present WILLIAM BENDIX as the guy from Brooklyn . There's plenty to admire about the gritty and realistic battles and the overall quality of the performances , and sure , it's propaganda , the kind America needed at the time to keep morale high during the war , but it's well worth watching as a reminder of the sacrifices all these men made on behalf of our freedom today . Trivia note : Just read Christopher Mulrooney's review of this film and you have to wonder what planet he's coming from .
447692	1048771	82779	6.0	Especially , if no one suspects you . . .	Agatha Christie's ' Murder Is Easy ' gets off to a brisk start with Helen Hayes as a little old lady on her way to Scotland Yard to report a series of murders in her village . She describes the look that made her realize who the murderer is and tells Bill Bixby , " If no one suspects you , murder is easy . " Shortly after she leaves the train station , she is killed in an auto accident . Thus , Bixby decides to investigate for himself . Carmen Culver's teleplay would have been better if it hadn't updated the Christie material and tried to modernize the story with foolish computer nonsense . Furthermore , by devoting entirely too much time to the red herrings and focusing almost all of the remaining time on Lesley-Anne Down and Bill Bixby's growing relationship , it turns the surprise ending into little more than a sham for which there is no preparation . Bill Bixby's character in the novel was a young policeman - - here he is an American computer wizard who delves into use of the computer ( to no avail ) to solve the crime . He's charming and believable enough but too many scenes are throwaways involving him and Lesley-Anne Down . Suffice it to say that this is not one of the best adaptations of Christie's work . The technical aspects are excellent - - the color photography of the English settings is impressive and all of the performances are first-rate . Nice to see Olivia de Havilland and Helen Hayes as " special guest stars " . Helen Hayes contributes so much to the opening scenes that she makes up for the fact that there is no Miss Marple in this one . But the tight suspense of the final scenes in the novel when the murderer is caught and revealed is missing here and the explanations are too swift to carry much weight . Still , an absorbing who-dun-it for mystery fans although modernizing the story with computer detection work is no help at all .
445719	1048771	44419	6.0	Kirk Douglas leads dangerous expedition in Indian territory . . .	If ever a sprawling tale about an expedition up the Missouri river to trade furs begged for Technicolor photography , THE BIG SKY is it . Based on the novel by A . B . Guthrie , it has KIRK DOUGLAS in the lead as the head of the expedition but most of the footage belongs to young DEWEY MARTIN in his first big screen role . Why he never managed to become a more important player in Hollywood remains a mystery to me . Unfortunately , Dudley Nichols ' screenplay is rather episodic and there are many points toward the end of the film where it seems the story is about to end and then there are further scenes . I found none of the narration objectionable ( as others here seem to imply ) , but the structure of the screenplay is awkwardly handled , especially toward the latter part of the film . Another minus point , the night scenes in the woods look as though they were photographed in a studio and not on location which minimizes the sense of danger from Indians and other trappers that the story requires . But most of the exterior daylight scenes are photographed in crisp B & W photography in real outdoor settings which tend to jar against the studio-lit scenes , making them more noticeable . There's plenty of male camaraderie and friendship among the trappers and colorful incidents involving the Indians , so if this kind of western is your thing you'll undoubtedly find it interesting . I watched the 140 minute version on TCM and it was slow going at times . Summing up : Biggest drawback : should definitely have been filmed in breathtaking Technicolor .
446352	1048771	82089	6.0	An air of deja vu hangs over the plot line of " Body Heat " . . .	There's plenty of heat generated in BODY HEAT and most of it comes from the steamy situations set up by director Lawrence Kasdan and , in her debut film role , KATHLEEN TURNER , who turns up the heat even more with a dynamic performance as " the femme fatale " . But all of the material will seem familiar if you've ever seen THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE or DOUBLE INDEMNITY . Still , there are some fresh new twists that will have you wondering just how this whole story will play out once WILLIAM HURT ( in a role similar to Fred MacMurray's in DOUBLE INDEMNITY ) learns that he's been played for a fall guy by Turner , who wants him to kill her wealthy husband so they can share the wealth . Not only is there a clever twist at the end , but the whole story has been modernized for ' 80s audiences by including some graphic depictions of soft core sex . Hurt and Turner are frequently seen writhing about in simulated sexual embraces , thus making the title a plausible one . It's the kind of story James M . Cain might have written in the ' 30s or ' 40s , and when done as effectively as it is here , with John Barry's intriguing score adding some extra dimension to the film noir atmosphere of the tale , it can hold the audience in its grip until that final moment . Well worth seeing for Hurt's very persuasive performance as the weak-minded lawyer dazzled by sex and Turner's debut as a screen siren .
447112	1048771	82085	6.0	Another DePalma thriller that owes a lot to Hitchcock . . .	BLOW OUT deserves more attention than a lot of other thrillers from the ' 80s , partly because it's taut with suspense most of the time and owes a lot of its chill to JOHN LITHGOW's performance as a cold-blooded psychotic killer . It's also one of JOHN TRAVOLTA's best early roles as a soundman looking for " the perfect scream " for one of his horror movies who accidentally shoots some film of a car careening off a bridge . He dives into the water to try saving the victims but is only able to rescue the woman ( NANCY ALLEN ) . It turns out that the driver was a senator who was a presidential candidate ( shades of Chappaquiddick ) . From then on , the mystery deepens as he comes to suspect there's some kind of conspiracy involved . DENNIS FRANZ is Allen's boss , a sleazy photographer , who offers to help Travolta . The whole story is filmed with all the DePalma camera tricks and touches that keep the suspense boiling until the climactic shoot-out at the climax . But it's JOHN LITHGOW who steals the film as the merciless killer with undisclosed political reasons for his murderous mission . A forgotten gem among the stylish DePalma films that deserves more recognition today . I'm not much of a Travolta fan , but this is one of his better roles .
447769	1048771	29082	6.0	Norman Krasna and Groucho Marx on the script ! ! . . . so what happened ?	I really only know FERNAND GRAVET from his playing of Johann Strauss in THE GREAT WALTZ and was not overly impressed with his by-the-numbers impersonation of the great music master . So , truth be told , I wasn't expecting much from this little comedy co-starring him with JOAN BLONDELL , another so-so actress who occasionally had a bright role to play in films like A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN but usually had to be content with less than impressive roles in screwball comedies of the ' 30s and ' 40s . Considering that the script for THE KING AND THE CHORUS GIRL is penned by Norman Krasna and Groucho Marx , it's a shame the material lacks the sort of wit to be expected when those two minds collaborated . Let me put it this way - - Gravet is supposed to be able to sit through a show with his eyes wide open but asleep . That's the way I felt forcing myself to stay with this " comedy " . He sits patiently through KENNY BAKER's tenor solo at a nightclub in Paris on a huge art deco set but is soon transfixed by flirtatious bit of business from JOAN BLONDELL as a chorus girl flashing a mirror beam at his face and promptly decides he wants to have dinner with her . Blondell is introduced to EDWARD EVERETT HORTON as a Count and MARY NASH as a Duchess before her dinner date with Gravet , as King Alfred VII . The trouble is the bored king has fallen asleep . There's such a lack of wit in the writing that you may fall asleep too . Hard to believe that with this pleasant cast , Krasna and Marx couldn't do better . It's a screenplay that strains to be funny - - but isn't . Gravet is more animated than usual in comedy , but is most convincing when he's bored . Blondell is prettily photographed and pleasant as the chorus girl but it's a role that's no stretch for any young actress . Wasted in a supporting role is JANE WYMAN ( with French accent ) , who would later do another little Krasna comedy called PRINCESS O'ROURKE in a much better supporting role . The slim plot depends upon Blondell's resistance to the King's charm , determined as she is to be as unimpressed as possible . Their first meeting ends disastrously with Blondell finding his behavior boorish . It's the sort of theme that was much better done years later with Marilyn Monroe and Laurence Olivier in THE PRINCE AND THE SHOWGIRL . Summing up : Fernand Gravet tries hard but he's no Cary Grant in screwball comedy - - and both he and Blondell needed a better script !
446456	1048771	240511	6.0	Old blue eyes and Nancy carry the hour with favorite tunes . . .	Another FRANK SINATRA show from ' 66 has him opening with FLY ME TO THE MOON and closing with PUT YOUR DREAMS AWAY FOR A LITTLE WHILE . It's a breezy hour show with Sinatra looking as jaunty and comfortable before an audience as he ever did . He seems in a bouncy mood as he goes through a whole slew of his favorite songs , as well as a brief duet sequence with Nancy , who says she'd been in the business for six months when this show aired and already had a couple of Gold platters . His songs include : FLY ME TO THE MOON , THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL IN THE WORLD , MOONLIGHT IN VERMONT and NOBODY TILL SOMEBODY LOVES YOU . Then Nancy came on and sang two of her hits , BANG , BANG HE SHOT ME DOWN and ON Broadway before dad joins her for YES , SIR THAT'S MY BABY and DOWNTOWN . And finally , the two of them join in for her hit song , THESE BOOTS WERE MADE FOR WALKING . Sinatra winds up his segment of the show with IT WAS JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS , MY HEART STOOD STILL , LOVE IS BEAUTIFUL , LUCK BE A LADY ( at his zesty best ) , THAT'S LIFE , GRANADA and CHICAGO . With Nelson Riddle and Gordon Jenkins arrangements , it's a solid show for Sinatra fans to enjoy and a bit of nostalgia too .
446638	1048771	24601	6.0	Amusing comedy gets better after a slow start . . .	LAUREL & HARDY are next door neighbors ( married to DOROTHY CHRISTY and MAE BUSCH , respectively ) , both strong-minded women who remind me of the " Alice Kramden " character on " The Honeymooners " . Neither one wants their hubby to go to a Chicago convention of The Sons of the Desert , so the boys have to fake an excuse in order to bamboozle their wives into thinking Oliver is following his doctor's orders to get a restful vacation in Honolulu . At the convention , it's a hoot to see dancing girls in Hawaian costumes ( beefy and overweight by today's anorexic standards ) while a slim male singer / dancer renders " Honolulu Baby " in a tenor voice . CHARLEY CHASE has a field day playing practical jokes on the boys , but it's the return home part of the story that really is the set-up for the best gags . In fact , it's the last twenty-five minutes that puts the film over the top as one of the best Laurel & Hardy features . Written by Frank Craven ( the film actor , who also contributed to several screenplays ) and directed by George A . Seiter , it's obviously the forerunner of many situation comedies about quarreling husbands and wives trying to outsmart each other . Stan is surprisingly funny when given a long , wordy sentence to say , and Oliver's facial reactions ( especially when he fixes his gaze on the camera as if to say , ' Can you believe this ? ' ) , are priceless . Lots of fun for fans of the comedians .
446308	1048771	35105	7.0	Delightful comedy from B'way stage hit . . . Russell at her best . . .	ROSALIND RUSSELL was always at her best in comedies and here she had a role that got her an Oscar nomination for Best Actress in 1942 - - and it's easy to see why . She's downright hilarious as the gal from Ohio with writing ambitions and a pretty blonde sister ( JANET BLAIR ) with a penchant for attracting men and trouble . All the wacky situations stem from their Greenwich Village basement apartment which seems to have more visitors than Grand Central Station . It's all exaggerated fluff , but it works , thanks to a fine cast and sterling performances . RICHARD QUINE and GORDON JONES do repeats of their Broadway roles , and DONALD MacBRIDE as a policeman who wants quiet on his route is hilarious . JUNE HAVOC makes a brief appearance as a medium who used to live in the girls ' apartment . GEORGE TOBIAS , as the opportunistic landlord with the Greek accent , is at his funniest in a colorful supporting role . My favorite moment is the conga sequence with Russell and Blair trying to get rid of sailors who don't speak a word of English , creating a disturbance that lands Blair in jail . Janet Blair is pleasant as the blonde bombshell but it's Russell who milks the most out of her role and gets all the laughs . She's terrific . BRIAN AHERNE does what he can with the role of the talkative editor , but it's not much of a part . Still , he adds a certain debonair charm to the role . Summing up : Notable chiefly as a terrific vehicle for Russell's unique brand of comic talent .
445971	1048771	26138	7.0	Quality sequel is visually even more stunning than " Frankenstein " . . .	Even better than the original . Add to the quality of FRANKENSTEIN some even better visuals ( German expressionism again in the sets ) , the grander look and concept of the whole story with the monster humanized in a believable way , and the music of Franz Waxman which highlights all of the most dramatic moments , especially the creation of The Bride - - and you have a film even more satisfying than the original . COLIN CLIVE is implored by ERNEST THESIGER to help him make a mate for the monster . Eventually , a memorable scene with the Bride being unveiled ( it turns out to be ELSA LANCHESTER who can scream with the best of them ) , has her seeing her mate for the first time and gazing at him with wide-eyed fright as she lets out a piercing scream . It's just one of many comical and whimsical moments in the whole film . VALERIE HOBSON is Clive's frightened sweetheart , and UNA O'CONNOR ( another screamer ) , DWIGHT FRYE and JOHN CARRADINE round out the supporting cast with style . BORIS KARLOFF repeats his famous role , even more engaging this time as he seems significantly brighter in the range of things he's given to do , such as the famous woodland scene interacting with a blind man in a cottage , both of them enjoying a new friendship . This scene , especially , will remind you of Mel Brooks ' YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN , but it's played here more as a tender interlude rather than comedy . Totally absorbing with great looking sets and atmosphere , heightened by a Franz Waxman score worth listening to . Fans of the original should love this one .
447289	1048771	43792	7.0	Another good collaboration of Leisen and Brackett . . .	Charles Brackett and Mitchell Leisen collaborated on a few successful films , including the dramatic TO EACH HIS OWN ( ' 46 ) , but here the accent is on a rollicking romantic comedy starring GENE TIERNEY , JOHN LUND , THELMA RITTER and MIRIAM HOPKINS . It's a spin on the mistaken identity theme , with Ritter inadvertently thought to be a much needed maid when she shows up at Gene Tierney's house at an opportune moment with the lady in distress for a good cook . Thelma assumes the identity of the hired help while socialite Tierney is unaware that she's really the mother of John Lund , her new hubby . Even more complications ensue when Tierney's snobbish mother ( MIRIAM HOPKINS ) turns up , intending to show her disapproval of Tierney's impulsive decision to marry Lund . Lund has no affection for Hopkins . " She fills every room with poison gas , " he remarks to his colleagues at work . POSSIBLE SPOILERS HERE But it's his own snobbish attitude in not wanting to tell Tierney his mother's identity that gets him into hot water with Gene when she finds out the truth about their cook . She puts on the big freeze and tells him she's going to take up residence in Mexico - - until things are straightened up in the last ten minutes with a rather contrived ending that has Tierney and Lund suddenly reunited while Ritter unexpectedly finds a mate of her own . THELMA RITTER was Oscar-nominated as the fast talking mother-in-law who happens to be a gourmet cook - - one of six nominations but no wins . Summing up : Well worthwhile , with all of the principal players getting a chance to show a nice flair for comedy .
446661	1048771	91763	7.0	The ugliness of war as seen by an infantry platoon . . .	I saw this one years after it was made and the biggest imprint on me was making me feel depressed after watching how the men struggled to keep their sanity in a war that made no sense to anyone at the time . CHARLIE SHEEN is excellent as the college youth whose innocence about man's inhumanity to man gradually changes during the course of ground combat in the jungles of Vietnam ; and WILLIAM DAFOE and TOM BERENGER excel as two Marine sergeants who oppose each other ( hate is a better word ) with Berenger being the brutal bully and Dafoe representing a saner approach . Oliver Stone won his Best Picture / Best Director award and it's easy to see why . He kept the film's narrow focus on the men and the struggle they all have for survival under brutal circumstances . Missing are the stereotyped war buddies so commonly seen in the ' 40s films ( the guy from Brooklyn , the dumb newbie , the baby-faced Marine ) and instead we have more realistic characters facing a relatively unseen enemy hidden in the thick brush and using the kind of profane language servicemen commonly do whether in wartime or peace . It's quite an achievement in capturing all the ugliness of war up close and personal - - but clearly not a film for everyone . And because it doesn't paint a rosy picture of America at war , it can be particularly depressing to watch at this time . Another possible flaw is that it has no clearly discernible plot and you're left constantly wondering where the whole story is going .
447557	1048771	12532	7.0	Visually impressive melodrama is wildly overacted but still compelling to watch . . .	ORPHANS OF THE STORM is quite an impressive looking silent film from D . W . Griffith , who was obviously the Cecil B . DeMille of his day . He has an instinct for showing surging crowd scenes involving all the unrest during the French Revolution and these scenes are highly detailed and very arresting visually . All the sets and costumes look as though a lavish budget was spent on this story of two sisters who survive the French Revolution after many melodramatic twists and turns of their fortune . DOROTHY GISH and LILLIAN GISH are the sisters , with Dorothy as the blind waif who is separated from her sister when an overly amorous nobleman orders Lillian to be brought to his orgy . From there on , the Dickensian plot becomes thicker and thicker as the girls suffer one indignity after another in order to survive . LUCILLE LaVERNE is the old hag ( she later was the model for Disney's Wicked Witch in " Snow White " ) , a harridan who makes Dorothy a beggar in the streets . " You'll shiver better without a shawl , " is one of her immortal lines . Joseph SCHILDKRAUT is very impressive in an early American screen role , demonstrating charm and skill of the kind that would land him important parts in future costume films like " Marie Antoinette . " MONTE BLUE is Danton , a man who meets LILLIAN GISH early in the story and later becomes the defender who saves her and Schildkraut from the guillotine . It's all very melodramatic , the acting ranging from overdone to wildly overdone . Griffith was never subtle in asking his performers to give it their all . Excessive wringing of hands , eye-rolling to show anguish , fierce looks to show hatred , etc . may cause unintended chuckles when viewed by today's audiences , but there is never any letdown in the telling of a compelling story using the French Revolution as rich background material for a tale of villainy and heroism . A fascinating silent film with an appropriate film score added to give the story even more force and flavor . Summing up : Overlong drama , but compelling from the start to the feverishly melodramatic end . Exquisite close-ups of Lillian Gish are touching and lend poignant charm to her performance .
447118	1048771	79116	7.0	Tough prison drama about escape from " the rock " . . .	When ALEC McGOOHAN , as the warden of Alcatraz , announces that " We don't make good people . We make good prisoners , " you know the convicts are in for a rough time from a man who is the equivalent of Captain Nigh when it comes to unreasonable punishment . The film is punishing too , in that it makes you feel the stark brutality that awaits anyone who doesn't toe the line - - brutal punishment both from guards and from other prisoners . As the new man on the cell block , CLINT EASTWOOD towers over the rest of the cast since he's the central focus of all the action . He's his own tough , terse self , given to brusque one-liners , determined not to let anyone play him for a fool . Thus , he has various encounters with guys who set out to stoolpigeon him in one way or another . There's a particularly graphic shower scene where he's roughed up by a man intent on forcible rape - - so the viewer has to be aware this story is not for the squeamish . It hooks you into the story from the opening sequence which has Eastwood going through the humiliating orientation experience , and from then on the story builds with suspense as he gradually convinces a couple of other prisoners to make an escape from " the rock " - - a plan that is fascinating to watch , although largely fictionalized because the actual men who escaped were never found and their true story never told . Don Siegel has directed with a firm control over his material and it's tense and action-packed with enough grim humor and suspense for a dozen prison movies . Eastwood is terrific and McGoohan makes a convincing adversary as he rules over the prison system with an iron hand . Highly recommended , the best of its kind .
446475	1048771	109831	7.0	Hugh Grant establishes his persona in excellent British comedy . . .	This is one of the funniest , wittiest , cleverest comedy / romances to come out of Great Britain , moving at a quick pace through a series of scenes commemorating FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL , with a cast of wonderful British players headed by HUGH GRANT and American actress ANDIE MacDOWELL . The running joke seems to be that Grant never knows what time it is , even though he's scheduled to attend a wedding almost every Saturday of his life . Grant plays the character in his standard befuddled , confused , yet charming manner and handles the role like a real pro . I'm not an admirer of ANDIE MacDOWELL but she's competent enough as his over-sexed sweetheart , the girl he falls in love with " at first sight " , with marriage eluding both of them because of some bad timing . At last , just when it seems Grant will tie the know with someone else , he comes to his senses ( thanks to a hilarious church scene that ends with his would-be bride punching him out of sheer vexation , knocking him flat on the church floor ) . Delightful performances by the entire cast , with special kudos to JOHN HANNAH , SIMON CALLOW , KRISTIN SCOTT THOMAS and ROWAN ATKINSON in great supporting roles . But it's Grant who keeps the thing buoyant and easy to take despite some of the implausibilities in detailing the relationship he has with MacDowell . Easy to see why the screenplay got an Oscar nomination .
446738	1048771	48944	7.0	Pleasant cast does wonders with slight comedy	Olivia de Havilland spent most of her post-Oscar years in serious dramas , so it's nice to see her looking so radiantly lovely in a technicolor comedy , enjoying herself in a comedy for a change . Paris is the setting and the color photography is excellent . The slight story concerns de Havilland seeking to prove to her father ( Edward Arnold ) and a senator and his wife ( Adolphe Menjou , Myrna Loy ) that American servicemen aren't all wolves and to prove it has a harmless fling with a young G . I . ( John Forsythe ) . Unfortunately , as in all Norman Krasna comedies , plot complications develop before she winds up in Forsythe's arms for an amusing final scene . The cast sparkles with some fine work by de Havilland , Myrna Loy , Adolphe Menjou , Edward Arnold and - - in one of his funniest roles - - Tom Noonan . Only bad piece of casting is John Forsythe - - who looks wooden and uncomfortable throughout with no comic flair whatsoever . Despite this , de Havilland manages to give a spirited performance that won the Belgian Prix Femina for Best Actress in a comedy in ' 56 . Slight but amusing and very watchable .
446798	1048771	90490	7.0	The saga continues - - in good form . . .	NORTH AND SOUTH , BOOK II has to be one of the best TV mini-series ever made about the Civil War . Everything about it is epic , including the battle scenes and the scope of the story which uses the Civil War background in an interesting way . Many real-life personalities are woven into the story of love and friendship during the war - - including HAL HOLBROOK , impressive as Abraham Lincoln , and LLOYD BRIDGES as Jefferson Davis . Once again , the fortunes of the Hazzarads and the Mains is told in interesting vignettes that take shape as the story progresses through the start of the war until the end . Along the way , you'll recognize a lot of famous names , including KIRSTIE ALLEY , in one of her unlikeliest dramatic roles , OLIVIA DE HAVILLAND , David CARRADINE , LESLEY-ANNE DOWN , PARKER STEVENSON , PATRICK SWAYZE , LEE HORSLEY , JEAN SIMMONS and JAMES STEWART . Olivia de Havilland has told an amusing anecdote of how she only accepted the role of Mrs . Neal , the head nurse , when told that she tended to the wounded of both North and South - - since the South had already only known her as Melanie , the flower of southern womanhood in GWTW . Photographed in color , it's exceptionally well filmed with sets and costumes that are above reproach . Aside from the romantic angle , it presents an accurate picture of the Civil War era and is a sort of history lesson as well as a compelling drama . Well worth viewing and every bit as impressive as Book I .
445796	1048771	40202	7.0	Semi-documentary style and authentic locations gives the film a gritty look . . .	CALL NORTHSIDE 777 is a fascinating semi-documentary filmed in realistic style by Henry Hathaway and featuring a fine central performance by JAMES STEWART , as a newspaper reporter anxious to prove that an innocent man is still serving time for a crime he never committed . Others in the cast do their standard good work , including RICHARD CONTE as the wrongly convicted man , LEE J . COBB as a newspaper editor and E . G . MARSHALL . But most of the supporting players are no-names who give an authentic feel to all the minor roles , as does the fact that the film uses actual Chicago locations which gives the whole story an added flavor of realism . Although the ending should come as no surprise to anyone aware that justice will be done , getting the solution to an eleven-year old murder is what counts here . The manner of police detection may have changed considerably since the late ' 40s , but the film is a timeless example of corruption exposed and a man's brave efforts to exonerate an innocent man . Well worth watching .
447764	1048771	40662	7.0	Lean's wonderful follow-up to " Great Expectations " . . .	After the experience of seeing GREAT EXPECTATIONS on the big screen , I looked forward to what David Lean would do with OLIVER TWIST . I wasn't disappointed - - it's possibly the best version of the Dickens tale that I've ever seen with all the Victorian-era darkness and poverty serving as a rich background to a number of interesting Dickensian characters . ALEC GUINNESS has the role of a lifetime as Fagin , the pickpocket thief who keeps his boys on a tight reign . Among the boys - - the very young ANTHONY NEWLEY as The Artful Dodger . But a standout in the film is the central performance of young JOHN HOWARD DAVIES - - he's a brilliant choice to play the underfed boy in the poorhouse " who wanted more " and is eventually reunited with Mr . Brownlow ( the wonderful HENRY STEPHENSON ) for a happy ending . Later musicalized and called OLIVER ! , it's hard to watch the film today without recalling where the musical numbers were inserted and almost expecting them to break out in song . But the bleak atmosphere of Lean's film about the orphan waif taken in by a gang of thieves is so stark , at times , that it rules out thoughts of musical moments . ROBERT NEWTON makes a picturesque Bill Sykes but is occasionally over the top in his characterization , but KAY WALSH makes a wonderfully compelling Nancy and FRANCIS L . SULLIVAN is wonderful as Mr . Bumble . Summing up : Full display of the art of Guy Green's B & W cinematography to heighten the mood of the drama .
446965	1048771	413300	7.0	Spidey still spins a mean web . . . but the romance is wearing thin . . .	First of all , let me say that the romantic angle is played up more so in SPIDER-MAN 3 than it was in the other Spider-Man films , which is a distinct handicap for what is primarily an action film based on the famous comic book characters . It seems to drag noticeably in all of the quietly played scenes between TOBEY MAGUIRE and KIRSTEN DUNST , as his girlfriend May Jane whose singing career is stung by bad reviews . Then too , the scenes with ROSEMARY HARRIS , a warm and engaging actress , add to the almost soap opera flavor of the script in dealing with Spidey's human side . But fortunately , there are enough humorous moments to atone for some of the script's shortcomings in this regard . BRUCE CAMPBELL as a French Maitre d ' has a wonderful bit at the restaurant where Spidey is preparing to meet and propose to Mary Jane with a ring . And even bigger bits of humor are provided by J . K . SIMMONS as J . Jonah Jameson , the harried boss of the Daily Bugle , notably in his wonderful office scene where a diligent secretary has a novel way of reminding him to take his blood pressure pills . He's a welcome scene-stealing presence in any scene . There's plenty of villainy going on in the guise of three chaps bent on destroying Spider-Man , the best of which is THOMAS HADEN CHURCH as the ex-convict who gets caught up in an experiment that turns him into the Sandman creature that terrorizes New York City . His transformation scenes are brilliantly done with the CGI effects outdoing themselves . He has that tough guy persona that looks just right for the role . But the best written part for one of the three villains belongs to JAMES FRANCO who is able to convey much more of what makes Goblin II tick . He switches from affable to intense hatred with the greatest of ease and gets a lot out of the character he's playing . Not as well scripted , but easily among the best performers in the film , is TOPHER GRACE , arrogant rival photographer at the Daily Bugle , who does a fine job as a Spider-Man adversary when he turns into Venom . Unfortunately , this comes pretty late in the film ( almost as an afterthought by the writers ) and he doesn't get enough time on screen to flesh out the character which would have been one of the most interesting villains if time permitted . As it is , it all runs well over two hours and stays on a pretty smooth course throughout , for such a long film . Except for the lulls whenever Spidey deals with his romantic complications , it's a pretty fast-moving story that has some eye-filling special effects whenever things get too dull in the storytelling department . TOBEY MAGUIRE certainly gets a chance to stretch . When his darker side takes over ( and he's wearing that black suit ) , he shows a side of his screen personality that's been hidden in all the other Spider-Man films , and his arrogance with dance moves - - while staying in character with his nerdy side - - are played for laughs which are intentional . BRYCE DALLAS HOWARD makes a suitable cliff-hanging sort of heroine who can scream as well as Fay Wray ( the Queen of Scream ) , and THERESA RUSSELL stands out in her one brief scene as Mrs . Marko . I thoroughly enjoyed it as a blockbuster movie designed to entertain and thrill as only these Spider-Man movies can . The CGI is remarkable for the Sandman sequences , all the production values are first class and Christopher Young's background score is a decided asset . But , personally , I still think I preferred the other two Spider-Man films over this one .
445439	1048771	240558	7.0	In the groove . . .	As an example of the jitterbug craze that swept America during the early ' 40s , GROOVIE MOVIE is about as good a movie short as possible . The various dances are filmed from odd angles ( including beneath a glass floor to show all the intricate steps and patterns ) . The dancers are nimble youngsters who obviously know how to strut their energetic stuff before the cameras , mugging for the close-ups and having a high time while swinging their partners not only to and fro but up and over . A great example of the sort of movie short that played with a feature film in the old days . I'm surprised to read that one of the comments here states : " Not really a movie . It may have been produced to appear in a ' soundie ' but I'm not sure about that . " Obviously , this person never heard of a movie short , the sort that were a featured part of every double feature program in the ' 30s and ' 40s .
447565	1048771	48191	7.0	Fascinating but overwrought performances . . .	SUSAN HAYWARD has some strong , searing scenes full of fireworks in I'LL CRY TOMORROW - - as does JO VAN FLEET as her overbearing stage mother - - but there are times when you just wish Daniel Mann would keep the theatrical melodramatics a bit more under his control . The story of a confessed alcoholic singer is an unpleasant one and this is all the more reason why a little soft pedaling now and then would have helped . As it is , Mann has chosen to pull out all the stops and give us a saga of grim and unrelieved suffering for too lengthy a time . All of the performances are respectable enough - - including EDDIE ALBERT and MARGO as a couple who try to help the alcohol addicted Roth back on her feet again after an attempt at suicide forces her to go to the AA clinic . And Hayward does well by the songs that Roth supposedly performed in nightclubs , using her own voice and gestures she undoubtedly picked up from Jane Froman , whose biography she also did on screen a bit earlier . A toning down of the shrill melodramatics would have helped - - but , nevertheless , this is a frank and disturbing portrait of a woman on the skids and Miss Hayward does her best to give a convincing portrait .
447310	1048771	63671	7.0	Early Bogdanovich thriller really hits the mark . . .	Tight , suspenseful , full of cross-cutting scenes to follow the unfolding of two stories that are about to merge into one , TARGETS is the last major feature film that BORIS KARLOFF made , and it's one of his best during the latter part of his career . He's a man about to retire from the picture business , a horror film star called Byron Orlock , feeling he's too much of an anachronism in the changing world of the late ' 60s and that his kind of horror is passé . The part , in other words , is tailor-made to fit Karloff's real-life persona . The other strand of the story has to do with a deeply disturbed young man ( TIM O'KELLY ) who appears normal on the surface but is harboring ideas of using his arsenal of guns to become a killer . After slaughtering his family , he climbs a tower near a crowded highway and proceeds to target various cars at random , going for the kill with a sharpshooter's precision . He then turns his attention to a drive-in theater , where Byron Orlock is about to make a personal appearance along with his latest film . It's here that the two stories blend into one , as Orlock arrives to make his personal appearance and must confront the killer . It's here that the ending is a little hard to buy , as the script has Orlock becoming heroic enough to stand up to a mad killer . Tense , disturbing , extremely well edited so that the stories blend together smoothly , the only other members of the cast that I recognized were JAMES BROWN , who plays the boy's father - - a hunter who likes to take his son on father / son hunting trips - - and PETER BOGDANOVICH , who plays the director trying to get Orlock to read his script . Let's just say , he's better off behind the camera . A minor gem , it's well worth watching and Karloff's fans get to see him in some vintage footage from his old films .

He takes time out for some sweet talk with GENA ROWLANDS ( her debut ) , before getting on horseback and evading his pursuers . That's where the brutal punishment continues - - as he takes his horse into the high country among rugged hillsides and winding paths along cliffs to avoid the posse of police cars and helicopters looking for him . The movie ends on a grim note when truck driver CARROLL O'CONNOR meets up with horse and rider on a dark rainy night . There's a turnabout at the end where WALTER MATTHAU , relentlessly hunting him up until that point , decides not to identify him for the authorities - - figuring he's had punishment enough by this time . So has the audience . But it's a fascinating glimpse at the troublesome life of a stubborn cowboy who railed against all the rules of life . Trivia note : Understandably , KIRK DOUGLAS considers it one of his favorite films .
447106	1048771	473705	7.0	Mature political thriller provides gripping entertainment . . .	It's a pleasure to report that STATE OF PLAY revives my interest in political thrillers . This one starts out with a suspenseful killing on a dark and rainy night in an alley and never lets go of a grip on the attention . The actors all have great help from a well-written , tightly paced script that affords all of them to shine . RUSSELL CROWE is the center of the tale as a scrappy newspaper reporter , slovenly and overweight , who doesn't care if he has to risk his life to help a friend caught up in a political scandal ( BEN AFFLECK ) . He and Affleck dominate the proceedings , each delivering forceful performances . RACHEL McADAMS is delightful as another nervy reporter , who becomes Crowe's sidekick and wants to help him get to the bottom of a mystery involving the death of a mysterious young woman with close connections to a corrupt corporation . HELEN MIRREN as a tough no-nonsense newspaper boss , JEFF DANIELS as a sleazy congressman with too much power and JASON BATEMAN as a smooth operator who talks too much - - all of them are excellent . Bateman is a real surprise , having developed into the kind of actor who could give James Bond a lesson in being suave and polished . He has certainly matured as an actor . MICHAEL BERRESSE is strikingly sinister as the gunman whose presence looms over the whole story as he prepares to assassinate others to keep a lid on corporate corruption in Washington , D . C . It's an intense thriller , directed in high style by Kevin Macdonald and should keep fans of this genre well entertained throughout .
447322	1048771	35169	8.0	Zany fun . . . overflowing with Sturges madness !	THE PALM BEACH STORY is not to be confused with reality . It's a zany romantic comedy given full speed treatment by director Preston Sturges who brought screwball comedy to an art form . His script , full of hilarious one-liners that fly by almost too fast to catch , is acted to perfection by CLAUDETTE COLBERT , RUDY VALLEE and MARY ASTOR - - with a less enthusiastic turn by JOEL McCREA who gives the only so-so performance , perhaps because none of the wittiest lines come his way . I've always liked this actor but here is performance is almost muted and strangely remote . Nevertheless , if screwball comedy is your dish , this is one you can relish . From the moment Colbert gets aboard a train carrying her to Palm Beach , the fun starts and gets into high gear , racing toward a conclusion that is not altogether satisfying nor even remotely hinted at until the final few minutes of film . It's a twist that somehow doesn't ring true - - the only really false note in an otherwise perfect screwball comedy . Rudy Vallee is outstanding as a nutty millionaire , a role written expressly for him ( and he even gets to sing a little ) - - and Mary Astor , as his husband hunting sister , is hilariously over the top as a woman who can't stop talking while pursuing her man . A good way to spend a pleasant 90 minutes .
447496	1048771	66473	8.0	A bit overlong in getting to the big battle . . . but worth the wait . . .	Detailing the events leading up to the infamous Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor , December 7 , 1941 - - and telling the story from both the Japanese and American point of view - - TORA ! TORA ! TORA ! is most effective when it gets to the day of battle which begins with the Japanese pilots getting into their planes and culminates in the extremely realistic depiction of the actual bombing . The film is faulty in getting us to that point , as it weaves back and forth between Hawaii and Washington , depicting Japanese and American behind-the-scenes intrigue , and in an objective way telling the complete story of the mistakes , big and small on both sides , that led the U . S . into World War II . Whether there are inaccuracies in the telling , for dramatic purposes , I'm not sure - - but it does seem to be even handed in its treatment of events . Although the cast is an impressive one , there are no single performances that stay in the mind . Instead , the viewer is aware of the vast scope of the story and the series of events that took place just before that fateful day - - which is as it should be . The Japanese segments held more fascination for me than the American sequences , for some reason . The pacing of the first two-thirds of the story is on the slow side . Not until the last forty-five minutes does the film come to life with an absolute sense of realism in its display of the bombing raid both from the air and on the ground . Technically , the film is a superb example of ' 70s film-making . All of the battle scenes are extremely well done for maximum effect . Yamamoto's final words serve as a chilling reminder , the kind of remark that still holds true in today's world where the U . S . is fighting a war against terrorism which , hopefully , has aroused " the sleeping giant " ( the U . S . ) to the extent that we will eventually triumph over our enemies who want to kill us as we were the victors over Japan . As a history lesson , this is a very valuable film indeed .
447819	1048771	39536	8.0	This is my kind of film noir . . . great performances from fine cast . . .	KISS OF DEATH easily ranks among the best film noirs of the ' 40s and it's widely remembered now as the first time audiences got a peek at RICHARD WIDMARK and what a fine actor he was . But it also served to remind us that when given a strong enough role , VICTOR MATURE was more than able to deliver the goods . He's excellent as Nick , the jewel thief kept back from holding decent jobs because of his prison record . When a nice D . A . ( BRIAN DONLEVY ) offers him a deal in exchange for squealing on some hoods , Nick finally takes the offer . The rest of the story deals with the consequences of his hard choice . Some nice supporting roles for MILDRED DUNNOCK , KARL MALDEN , COLEEN GRAY and MILLARD MITCHELL help turn this thriller , directed in taut style by Henry Hathaway , into a winner . Widmark deserved his Oscar nomination as Best Supporting Actor and Mature proved that he was more than just " a hunk of man " as he was labeled in those days .
445273	1048771	454769	8.0	One of the best bios on Flynn . . . shows another aspect of the man and his life . . .	This is an interesting and very informative , entertaining way to spend time learning about ERROL FLYNN . Aside from some penetrating comments from two of his ex-wives ( Nora Eddington and Patrice Wymore ) , there are some frank and very supportive comments on the real Errol Flynn ( if anybody really knew him ) from his most frequent co-star , Olivia de Havilland . It is the first time she has openly revealed anything about the deep love and affection Flynn and de Havilland had for each other . In addition , some very interesting comments by Richard Dreyfuss , who became a Flynn fan at the age of eight and gives what seem like spontaneous , off the cuff comments that seem unrehearsed and genuine . Daughter Diedre expresses the wish that others knew more about the quieter , family man side of Flynn that is obscured by all the tales of his womanizing . It seems that his real interest lay in writing , but although he wrote two novels ( neither a great literary success ) , he lacked the discipline to achieve his literary ambitions . Not easy to understand why anyone asked Joanne Woodward and Burt Reynolds to make contributions . Neither of them was a close confidante of the actor nor ever worked with him . Seems strange to hear them talking about him and contributing little to our knowledge of him without any first hand experience . The film clips , revealing Flynn in all his charismatic glory ( especially during the height of his career ) are generous and always stimulating , reminding us how great his screen presence was - - a combination of athletic grace and classic good looks along with acting ability that was often underrated . Any fan of the actor will appreciate this documentary . It has style and content and the kind of assurance about its subject that will endear it to Flynn's fans . If nothing else , it serves to remind us that he was one of the most dashing actors of the silver screen and , when teamed with Olivia de Havilland in those great adventure-romance classics , he had no peer . While it does deal with some of his unsavory exploits ( such as the rape trial ) , it does not exploit them and instead shows us another , more sensitive side of Flynn that has been missing in most biographies of the actor .
446076	1048771	48673	8.0	Fragile bittersweet romance amid gorgeous Italian settings . . .	" Summertime " is more of a mood piece than anything else . It captures the loneliness of a traveler in a foreign land , in this case a spinster who is hungry for love but too repressed to accept the love Rossano Brazzi offers . It has a bittersweet ending , appropriate for a thin story that sets the tone early on and never once makes us believe that Hepburn is going to find her true love in Venice . The photography is gorgeous and must have had everyone heading for the nearest travel bureau for a tour of Italy when the film was released . The performances are all excellent - - but the film belongs to Hepburn . She creates one of her most moving and truthful portraits - - sensitively showing us what this woman feels as she watches others pairing off for affairs , alone and unable to really connect . The sexual mores of the 1950s permeate the film - - the sexual revolution was just over the horizon but not yet evident . One of Hepburn's most subtle , yet affecting performances . With David Lean's sensitive direction , the gorgeous photography and the evocative background music , " Summertime " will put you under the spell of its fragile romance . Easy to see why Brazzi was the ultimate continental charmer .
447215	1048771	36112	8.0	Quite wonderful , but this blimp is a bit bloated . . .	If you want to see gorgeous Technicolor , lavish sets , fine performances ( ROGER LIVESEY , DEBORAH KERR ( in three roles ) and ANTON WALBROOK , then THE LIFE AND DEATH OF COLONEL BLIMP is your ticket . But beware , it is not a perfect film . It probably appealed much more to British audiences already aware of the famous comic strip " Colonel Blimp " which satirized a military man . Here , the satire has been preserved for a running time of almost three hours , and the film - - despite some marvelous scenes - - suffers from many scenes that should have been edited before the film went into general release . Furthermore , there is a decided British flavor to the whole thing which means that this is the sort of film which I'm sure has a much broader appeal to British audiences than American ones . The plot goes forward in a roundabout way , beginning at the end and then flashing back to the brash , youthful Colonel Candi full of daring , until it closes on the man who has become an anachronism among the military who dismiss his out of date methods during a field exercise and force him to retire . What's so remarkable about the production values are that this was Britain during the war when rationing and shortages of all kinds made film-making a very arduous task . You can detect none of this in the handsome Technicolor settings , even if some of the painted backdrops give a hint of some wartime austerity . Deborah Kerr's close-ups are as lovely as any she ever had during her lengthy career in American films - - but it is the two men , Roger Livesey and Anton Walbrook , who make the most of the meatiest roles . Walbrook has a very moving monologue toward the end of the film ( he's a German officer who reflects on his close ties to Britain and his good friend , the colonel ) , and Livesey gives a fully rounded portrayal ( yes , that's a pun ) of a blustery man that we see develop over a period of forty years from his arrogant youth to his stuffy old age . But the length of the film seems staggering at times - - it doesn't have the energy to move from scene to scene with anything but a snail's pace . This is the chief drawback of an otherwise excellent film .
445267	1048771	48947	8.0	A stunning comeback for Ingrid Bergman . . . Hayes deserved Oscar too . . .	The biggest conceit of ANASTASIA is the fact that the reunion scene , beautifully played by INGRID BERGMAN and HELEN HAYES , never took place in history . This is a romanticized version of what Anastasia's story should have been - - but was not . Nevertheless , giving credit where it's due , this is a completely absorbing , well acted version of the famous Anastasia legend . In 1956 it served as a stunning comeback for the exiled Ingrid Bergman , returning to America after a storm of controversy surrounding her affair with Italian film director Roberto Rossellini . Her career under his guidance was not entirely successful after starring in a mixed bag of Italian films . For slightly more accuracy , you might want to view a harsher version of the story , ANASTASIA : THE MYSTERY OF ANNA ( ' 86 ) which starred Amy Irving as the enigmatic heroine and Olivia de Havilland as the Dowager Empress who refused to meet her . It was given lush production values but had its share of fictional plotting to tell an equally absorbing story not entirely based on truth . As a vehicle for Ingrid Bergman's return to the American screen , she couldn't have been more fortunate . Not only does she give an inspired performance but she is surrounded by first class talent in every department of film-making . Helen Hayes , as the Dowager Empress , should have been awarded with her own Supporting Role Oscar as Best Actress . She is even more impressive here than she was as the stowaway in AIRPORT . Her final encounter with Bergman is played with dignity and restraint by both actresses . Yul Brynner does nicely in his fictional role and Martita Hunt gives the film's other most noteworthy performance as the Baroness . Alfred Newman's score perfectly captures the mood and atmosphere of the tale , as does the superb CinemaScope photography . Highly recommended , particularly for Bergman fans . Sadly , we know now that the woman who claimed to be Anastasia was not really so - - but I suppose this fact will not diminish your enjoyment of the film .
445288	1048771	55871	8.0	Classic World War II spy drama well worth watching . . .	When I hear the title THE COUNTERFEIT TRAITOR , I immediately think of my father because he often said it was his favorite spy film . Seeing it , years later , I understand why . WILLIAM HOLDEN was in the middle of a winning streak of films at this time and establishing a secure foothold on his reputation as one of Hollywood's finest actors . Since his role requires him to start as a cynical character , before he becomes convinced of the justness of his cause , it's a role that might well have gone to someone like HUMPHREY BOGART . But Holden , fortunately , got the part of the Swedish oil merchant who , through extortion and blackmail , is chosen by HUGH GRIFFITH to act as a spy against the Nazis in Denmark . He does so , unwillingly at first , but gradually , through his meeting with another spy , LILI PALMER ( in one of her best roles ) , comes to see things the way she does . The moment Palmer comes into the film , the plot thickens and interest mounts . The final result is a spy film that is truly mesmerizing , able to get a powerful grip on your heart and emotions , full of colorful action and intrigue . Stunning location photography in and around Copenhagen is a plus factor , as is the rousing score by Alfred Newman . Holden has never been more persuasive in a role that fits him like a glove . Taken from a true-life story , espionage tales don't come any better than this .
446443	1048771	52618	9.0	New DVD version is a full restoration of sight and sound . . . brilliant achievement !	' Ben-Hur ' is such a great film , it's a pleasure to report that the newly restored Wide Screen 4-Disc DVD version ( which includes the 1925 silent screen film with Ramon Novarro ) is right on the mark . The color has been restored to its original brilliance with every scene clearly in focus and the soundtrack gives full range to Miklos Rozsa's impressive score . More than ever , Rozsa's score seems to have an energy and force of its own , underlining all the drama inherent in a story of this kind . And Charlton Heston's work in the title role is sheer perfection . He captures the character so completely that he IS Ben-Hur . Not often does such an epic have human characters that are not dwarfed by all the spectacle . The characters are all fully-dimensional human beings - - particularly the two antagonists ( Judah Ben-Hur and Messala ) , once great friends but now divided by political loyalties . Charlton Heston and Stephen Boyd are outstanding in the leads ( Boyd should definitely have won an Oscar as Messala for his chilling death scene alone ! ) . All the other important roles are flawlessly cast . The chariot race is the most explosive and breathtaking seventeen minutes ever given to such a spectacular event - - and all of the stunts look perfectly real . It's hard to believe that none of the stunts ended with more than minor injuries . The final scene , which follows soon after the chariot race , with Ben-Hur returning home and slowly climbing the steps to find that his mother and sister have been cured , still gives me goose bumps when I see it . As does the poignant scene in the leper colony where he insists on seeing their cave dwelling . Both scenes are strongly bolstered by Miklos Rozsa's brilliant score . Fully deserved all the awards it won . Should be released theatrically to show folks that even in 1959 , Hollywood had all the technical skill to bring something like this off - - with spectacular results ! But in the meantime , this newly restored DVD is a keeper .
445518	1048771	372784	10.0	Let's get serious . . . the real Batman has arrived ! . . .	BATMAN BEGINS lives up to what I heard about it being a " darker " version , with much less reliance on flippant one-liners or gags , the result being a more realistic feel for what might have been . From the very start , there is a nice chemistry between Alfred , the butler ( superbly played by Michael Caine ) and Bruce Wayne ( excellent job by Christian Bale ) . The humor is of the gentle kind , almost subtle in its implications , and it sets the stage for the more realistic flow of events to follow . There's a pulsating background score by Hans Zimmer and John Newton Howard that races along with the film , punctuating it in just the right places , at just the right moments , to give a vigorous punch to the action scenes . And there are plenty of them . But the quieter moments are all extremely well played and given depth by real characterizations - - not just cartoonish figures . There is depth in all of the performances with the possible exception of Katie Holmes , an actress who speaks in a voice barely above a whisper and fails to project the belief that she is an assistant district attorney . Miss Holmes needs lessons in projecting her voice . Looming over the landscape is Liam Neeson , a distinguished actor who excels in his carefully concealed villainy . He is a force to be reckoned with and displays all of his versatility here . Equally effective in lesser roles are Morgan Freeman , Rutger Hauer as the Board Chairman that Bruce Wayne ultimately replaces , and Gary Oldman . The story is forcefully presented with magnificent visuals and eye-popping sets that all have a realistic gleam and are yet stylized enough to give credence to the fact that this is all based on a comic strip character . I can't praise Christian Bale enough as the man who dons that mask . He has all the strength and wily intelligence behind his serious good looks and makes the perfect embodiment of the action hero he is portraying . Firm of jaw , direct of gaze , he makes an excellent hero . Praise too for Cillian Murphy , who makes the most of his Scarecrow role behind a mask of creepy blandness , underplaying his role ( as most of the others do ) so as not to become a caricature , as so often happens in these Batman enterprises . If it's a series of running gags that you expect - - as from previous Batmans - - you won't find them here . The thrills come one after another , set pieces that are astounding to watch . Well worth the wait . Christopher Nolan has done an excellent job of handling his subject matter with great skill and flourish . Warning note : Perhaps a little too intense for children , but adults are certainly going to appreciate the fact that the real Batman has arrived .
