445355	1048771	385560	2.0	Insufferable . . . schlock of the worst kind . . . a stupid waste of time . . .	SCHLOCK would have been a better title for this absurd excursion into a poor excuse for a fright flick . Nothing redeems it . Not the story , the sub-par acting from a mostly teen cast , the witless dialog , the tired old explanation for all the goings on , and the complete lack of logic . Whenever things get dull , another fright scene with someone gurgling on blood or turning into a gooey monster of decomposing flesh , is supposed to provide the kind of shock appeal to target a young audience . Let's hope the kids today are a bit more discriminating in their taste for horror . This one is below the mark all the way . The only redeeming feature is the sleazy look of the abandoned hospital grounds . Enough to make your skin crawl , disgustingly dirty , rundown and evil looking . But the story and the characters are an insult to anyone's intelligence , poorly acted and directed to make this a complete waste of time . A writer like Stephen King could have done something with the basic idea - - but it's too late now .
446675	1048771	56526	4.0	Why they should never make remakes of classic films . . .	STATE FAIR - - the 1962 version - - is barely watchable . If it weren't for the Rodgers & Hammerstein songs , it would be a complete misfire . As it is , it just makes you yearn for the simple charm of the 1945 version that starred JEANNE CRAIN , DANA ANDREWS , DICK HAYMES and VIVIAN BLAINE in the roles occupied here by PAMELA TIFFIN , BOBBY DARIN , PAT BOONE and ANN-MARGRET . Jose Ferrer really struck out with this one , eliminating all the charm of the Technicolored version starring Crain as Margy , the girl who meets a newspaper man and falls hard . Then too , FAY BAINTER was ideal as the homespun mother worried about her chance of winning the prize at the fair for her jam , while here it's an ill-used ALICE FAYE making a sentimental return to Fox after years of retirement from the big screen . The songs are done only adequately , no more , and ANN-MARGRET cheapens the story with her interpretation of the singer at the fair . And even ALICE FAYE's throaty way with a song seems diminished by time . Summing up : Completely tasteless , boring version of the " American as apple pie " musical that first surfaced in 1945 .
445337	1048771	35151	4.0	Bad mix of comedy and drama . . . awful mess of a script . . .	How did two successful Hollywood stars of the magnitude of CARY GRANT and GINGER ROGERS ever sign on to do this totally unappetizing story after reading the script ? How did one of Hollywood's finest directors , Leo McCarey , write and direct this sort of trash ? How did this manage to open at one of New York City's most famous theaters ( Radio City Music Hall ) in 1942 with World War II still raging ? And why , on earth , did anyone stay awake after the first half-hour of this flat comedy romance that has an ultra ridiculous plot , something about Nazis pursuing a journalist and his wife while the war is threatening Jews with concentration camps . The humor is baffling ( the jokes are at the expense of Nazis and Jews ) and WALTER SLEZAK has a predictable role as - - what else - - a Nazi , of course . It's Ginger and Cary caught up in a hapless mess of a movie that has to be seen to be disbelieved . That anyone went for this pap is almost beyond reason . Summing up : In other words , a real dud you can afford to miss .
446905	1048771	66393	4.0	Gorgeous Norwegian scenery in search of a plot . . .	SONG OF NORWAY is an unbearably dull musical pastiche of clichés heard in every musical ever made that purported to be the saga of a composer's struggles to find recognition for his music . Edvard Grieg's struggles are so dull as to be non-stop in this awful compilation of Norwegian scenery by the truckload with no story to carry it . It is notable that the man who plays Grieg , TORALV MAURSTAD , never did make another American film , so disastrous were the reviews and box-office for this dull saga . Note also that FLORENCE HENDERSON was not able to make another film in Hollywood but went directly to television and stayed there for a very successful run on " The Brady Bunch " . See the film and you will judge yourself why it was an abject failure . And don't be fooled by the presence of OSKAR HOMOLKA , EDWARD G . ROBINSON and ROBERT MORLEY in the cast . They have little or nothing to do . Music lovers may be enchanted by Grieg's works , but not the way they are presented here . Nor is there any resemblance between the zestful SOUND OF MUSIC and its picturesque way of dealing with the Von Trapp Singers and this dull as dishwater musical that would work better as a travelogue of Norway with the plot excised . See it at your own risk .
446708	1048771	29804	4.0	Dreary stuff . . . RKO giving Fontaine the starlet treatment . . .	A man runs for mayor on a bet . The mayor's daughter meets him at a political campaign and it's hate at first sight . The chill only lasts until their next encounter , but by then we know this is a formula romantic comedy and they'll both be in love for the windup . After a few more misunderstandings , PRESTON FOSTER and JOAN FONTAINE walk off arm in arm and the simple plot is over in an hour . Strictly an RKO programmer that passed the time in ' 37 , a time when JOAN FONTAINE was being promoted as a new RKO starlet but given material that would have defeated any other ingenue . There is nothing here that suggests she would go on to an Oscar-winning career . PRESTON FOSTER carries the main burden , as does Herbert Mundin as his timid valet , and the whole thing has the look of a B-film that nobody had much faith in . Interesting only to see the two leads in their prime but with very little chemistry between them . Trivia note : Whether it's because his make-up is too dark or not , even in B & W Foster's eyes come across as bluer than Paul Newman's .
445794	1048771	29654	4.0	Rival newspaper reporters have stormy romance . . .	There isn't anything in THERE GOES MY GIRL that hasn't been done before in screwball comedies of the ' 30s and ' 40s . This has the feisty ANN SOTHERN playing a game of oneupmanship with would be hubby GENE RAYMOND , both of them cheated out of getting married by their scheming boss RICHARD LANE . The story is absurd , the plot contrivances are everywhere , and it's just a matter of time before Sothern and Raymond are able to tie the knot by using physical restraint on Lane to keep him from interfering with their nuptial ceremony . It's old hat stuff given a little too much zest from pert ANN SOTHERN , at her feistiest , and GENE RAYMOND , trying hard to be a comedian but not exactly a master of disguises . His French accent is a disgrace . Newspaper stories were quite the fad in the ' 30s and this is just another one of those fast paced comedies that makes absolutely no sense when you stop to think about it . Other stars , like Rosalind Russell , Jean Arthur , Claudette Colbert , Irene Dunne and even Bette Davis , did similar screwball newspaper stories but with much better scripts .
446016	1048771	29565	4.0	Horrid little British B-film is a waste of time . . .	This is about on par with the lowest of the Monogram films that the U . S . produced during the ' 40s - - however , it's a British B-film with little to recommend it . Holmes is played by sharp-featured Arthur Wontner ( who bears somewhat of a resemblance to Basil Rathbone ) and Ian Fleming is a suave version of Dr . Watson . Unfortunately , Lyn Harding is a very unimpressive figure as Professor Moriarty . The story taken from " Silver Blaze , " left me uninvolved with its racetrack background . The TCM presentation begins with an announcement that the film has been restored , but you'd never know it . The soundtrack is poor with much of the British dialog unintelligible and the scenes themselves are murky and poorly photographed . I lost count of how many times Wontner says , " Elementary , my dear Watson , " but let's just say this will never rank as one of my favorite Sherlock Holmes stories . Summing up : A feeble exercise in mystery that seems longer than its one hour and six minutes .
446458	1048771	174576	4.0	Dreadful Technicolor short is early Warner Bros . use of color . . .	SYBIL JASON is the girl whose father dies and leaves her the owner of " Wonder Horse " . The rest of the short film has Sybil in full Shirley Temple mode - - laughing , crying , singing - - but all to no avail . Let's just say it's best to remember her in the two Technicolor films she made with Shirley Temple in the late thirties . As for the all-star cast , you get a fleeting glimpse of EDWARD G . ROBINSON and OLIVIA DE HAVILLAND , a bit of humor from FRANK McHUGH and HUGH HERBERT , some attempts at humor from AL JOLSON and RUBY KEELER , and an altogether sappy racetrack story that has been done in better films a hundred times over . Every cliché imaginable has been trotted out in the space of 18 minutes . Summing up : No kudos for this one .
447375	1048771	39160	5.0	Bland performance by Frances Gifford in key role ruins the impact . . .	FRANCES GIFFORD had one of the best roles of her career as the troubled wife of lawyer GEORGE MURPHY in THE ARNELO AFFAIR , but the director fails to get more than worried looks and a coma-like expression that she wears most of the time - - while looking very beautiful . Facially , she bears a strong resemblance here to Donna Reed . She's a woman who feels neglected by her busy husband and falls prey to the flattery of a womanizing man ( JOHN HODIAK ) who later kills a woman and sets up Gifford as the murderess . Only through the keen detective work of a doggedly determined officer ( WARNER ANDERSON ) and the gradual realization of her husband that she's been seeing Hodiak , do the deceptive Hodiak's schemes fall apart as clues are unraveled . EVE ARDEN , as a dress designer friend of the heroine , has her usual quips but none of them are particularly inventive . It's strictly a B-film that has all the MGM gloss but falters because of a weak script and a poorly directed actress in the leading role . Miss Gifford gives a bland performance in a role that calls for more than close-ups of a fixed expression . Hodiak is fine as the cunning predator and nine year old DEAN STOCKWELL is lively as Gifford's loving son . GEORGE MURPHY is unable to do much with the role of the neglectful husband , a thankless role that he plays in stolid style .
446289	1048771	26116	5.0	Early color cartoon has its moments with advertising products . . .	BILLBOARD FROLICS is an early two-strip color cartoon in which billboards advertising ' 30s products come to life with uneven results , some funny , some mystifying and others just falling short of being really humorous . Toward the end , it turns into a cat chases bird sequence that becomes tiresomely familiar to all devotees of cartoon shorts . The animation is on the rough side , without the finesse we expect to see but didn't happen until the ' 40s , and the overall result is a bit disappointing . Best moment comes at the start , with the EDDIE CANTOR billboard coming to life with a jaunty " Merrily We Roll Along " song number . Other billboards become animated with results varying according to one's familiarity with the products . Cutest one : The Little Dutch Cleanser girls who step off the advertisements and do a Dutch dance . The kiddies will be amused even if the ads are for products that no longer exist .
445972	1048771	38916	5.0	Artificial melodrama with psychological overtones . . .	JUNE ALLYSON is really irritating in this one . She's got the petulance down pat , pouting throughout what is supposed to be her great dramatic role ( musicals being her forte ) . MGM obviously hoped that this would prove to be a turning point in the way of future dramatics for the usually sunny June . Seems she's supposed to be despondent over losing her dead father at an early age , unable to accept his death and unwilling to depart from his memory ( like him , she plays piano constantly ) , unable to accept her step-mother , CLAUDETTE COLBERT , who is concerned about Allyson's psychosis - - especially when Allyson starts imagining that Claudette's love interest ( WALTER PIDGEON ) is in love with her . To give it class , MGM made sure they used some classical music for Allyson to play , gave it elegant sets and an overall polished look that might have worked well on a better film . But this is so obviously supposed to be a psychological tear-jerker to give Colbert and Allyson strong dramatic roles . Unfortunately , the contrivances are so pat and the overall effect so absurdly superficial that all you can do is hope JUNE ALLYSON will get over her dramatic ambitions and do the things she does best . Nice cast , including ROBERT STERLING ( as Allyson's more sensible brother ) , PATRICIA MEDINA , MARSHALL THOMPSON and LIONEL BARRYMORE ( as a crusty old doctor ) , helps somewhat , but nothing can disguise the fact that they're all wasting their time in a phoney melodrama adrift in the usual Hollywood psycho-babble meant to be taken seriously .
446435	1048771	30442	5.0	Overdone screwball comedy is painful to contemplate . . .	I can't believe all of these rave comments on what is essentially a screwball comedy that lacks the magic of other such items made during the ' 30s . This one is decidedly less successful than OUR MAN GODFREY or HARD TO GET ( Dick Powell / Olivia de Havilland ) or even FOUR'S A CROWD . Once again , it takes potshots at the rich - - specifically BILLIE BURKE who is head of a loony household . She's a wealthy woman who hires hobos or ex-cons to run her estate , never listening long enough to anyone who might have described their situation - - but then , there would be no story . Such is the case with BRIAN AHERNE who shows up at her doorstep to report a car accident but is soon swept into the household and hired as a chauffeur . CONSTANCE BENNETT is Burke's lovely daughter so we know where this plot device is going . BONITA GRANVILLE has another one of her bratty roles to play as she torments butler ALAN MOBRAY . She specialized in these roles but becomes irritating pretty fast . The silliness of the whole story goes into overdrive , milking every situation for whatever laughs can be derived from such exaggerated screwball material . By the time it's over , you're either having a ball at the expense of this loony family or judging the film to be excessively over baked nonsense that hardly stands up to close inspection . You know which side I'm on . Summing up : Predictable screwball mess , it wastes the talents of a fine cast .
447829	1048771	198551	5.0	America's propaganda to boost WWII morale . . .	Propaganda was sometimes pretty heavy-handed during the WWII years and " I Am An American " demonstrates this point to perfection . It's about as flag waving as you can get , but taken in the context of those war years , it's understandable that every major studio in Hollywood was coming up with films of this ilk . It also happens to be a sketchy history lesson , encompassing so much of America's history in fleeting montages devoted to the discovery and building of a great country , peopled by all nationalities . It's obviously a " united we stand , divided we fall " kind of philosophy that sets the tone for the film . DENNIS MORGAN is pictured at a morale boosting rally to sell war bonds and delivers a very patriotic speech in professional fashion . Obviously , this was intended as Warner's salute to Americans during the height of WWII . It follows the history of a Polish family and its contributions to the war effort through the sacrificing of many young men to fight various wars .
445466	1048771	35766	5.0	First of the " Crime Doctor " movies with Warner Baxter . . .	It's odd that CRIME DOCTOR ( ' 43 ) , the film that started the B-film series at Columbia , is one of the least involving of the Dr . Ordway stories . The first half-hour is pretty dull before the film takes on any real interest in the amnesia background of Baxter's character . His development from complete amnesia to gradual recall is well handled and some of the scenes with JOHN LITEL have a certain amount of interest , but the story lacks overall believability with RAY COLLINS turning to the phone book in a search for Baxter's name and then becoming his mentor and leading him into a doctor's career with a quick montage of events establishing Baxter as a psychiatrist . MARGARET LINDSAY is attractive as the female interest , looking so much like a prettier version of Barbara Stanwyck , whom I always thought she resembled in manner and looks . For fans of the series , this one will do , but surprisingly it's not the sort of " first film in the series " that I expected and you have to wonder why Columbia decided to make a series after this one . WARNER BAXTER looks quite ill in most of his close-ups , so you can see the man was in fragile health all during these " Crime Doctor " films . He gives his usual solid performance but the film was a disappointment for me .
447284	1048771	56908	5.0	A glamorized , minor league " Snake Pit " full of melodramatics . . .	THE CARETAKERS represents what would have happened to THE SNAKE PIT if it hadn't been based on a semi-autobiographical novel and photographed with the accent on realism instead of Hollywood glamor . Every bad cliché imaginable is present in THE CARETAKERS ' script , and there are vague reminders that stand out as the plot situations seem taken from the outline of the Anatole Litvak movie . Here it's ROBERT STACK as the decent doctor ( instead of Leo Genn ) struggling to get his mental hospital on the right track instead of sticking to the old methods . His adversary is a rigid nurse ( JOAN CRAWFORD ) who wants nothing to do with his new ideas . She's given moral support by the equally hard nurse ( CONSTANCE FORD instead of Helen Craig in ' The Snake Pit ' ) , who is hell on wheels as the opposition for Stack . POLLY BERGEN is the unstable housewife ( instead of Olivia de Havilland ) , glamorized with every hair in place - - as are most of the other inmates - - and fluttering her false eyelashes as she recounts the troubled past that brought her to the hospital . It's hard to tell whether she's disturbed enough to be placed in the ward she's in because most of the time she makes more sense than the others . All of the women have wardrobes straight from a studio dressmaker and give no indication that they're in anything but a dressed down rest home for the weary . JANIS PAIGE hangs onto her glamor as a real nutcase who has occasional phony outbursts of distress where her mascara runs . BARBARA BARRIE is the film's token version of Betsy Blair ( the mute girl from ' The Snake Pit ' ) , unable to let people get close to her and providing the heroine ( Polly Bergen ) with a chance to break through to her silence and redeem herself in the eyes of doctor Stack who knows Bergen is getting well when Barrie is willing to put aside a flaming torch and embrace her . None of the outlined plot devices have any basis in reality . It's all a very shrill showcase for actresses who want us to believe in their melodramatic situation but are continually hampered by a cliché-ridden script and banal direction from Hall Bartlett . Trivia note : Herbert Marshall looks quite ill and had to film all his scenes in the afternoon when he was feeling up to the demands of acting . Summing up : Robert Stack is not well served by his doctor role here but would have better films in his future .
446239	1048771	22501	5.0	Poor Kay Francis suffers and suffers in another potboiler . . .	This is one of those KAY FRANCIS weepies that was so popular with audiences in the ' 30s ( don't ask me why ) . She suffers because she falls in love with an unethical Spaniard ( RICARDO CORTEZ ) who falls madly in love with her while her husband is away in India . Her foolish husband didn't want his wife to join him at his post in India because there would be too many hardships for her . The silly guy sends her off to Paris where she falls in love in " the city of love . " Attired in gowns that must have seemed luxurious and fashionable in the ' 30s , Francis has a hard time stirring much sympathy in a poorly written role . The first half-hour of the story is hard to get through but things pick up somewhat once she joins Cortez at his lavish and remote hideaway in Spain - - where he is ultimately murdered by a man seeking vengeance for Cortez's dalliance with his daughter . Kay Francis , in the meantime , has written a confession to her husband that she is in love with Cortez , but must now attempt to retrieve the letter before hubby reads it . The last twenty minutes contain a surprise or two that saves the whole story from sheer banality . The final twist is the only saving grace of a hackneyed storyline . Summing up : For Kay Francis fans only . Others beware .
445197	1048771	53017	5.0	Interesting but depressing . . . sad to see Montgomery Clift's frailty . . .	LONELYHEARTS is the story of a " Dear Abby " sort of columnist , unwillingly assigned to the job of helping the helpless losers who write to him ( MONTGOMERY CLIFT ) by a cynical newspaper editor ( ROBERT RYAN ) . Ryan is so despicable that you have to wonder if he patented these roles during the heyday of his career . Clift looks alarmingly frail and disconcerted , his posture like a question mark , his face obviously given careful cosmetic treatment after an accident that almost took his life . He's also distracting to watch as he plays the vulnerable man with so much obvious pity for his character . DOLORES HART is the loyal girlfriend who almost walks out on him when things get too rough and she misunderstands a crucial situation . MYRNA LOY has a rather peripheral role as Ryan's long suffering wife who sits on the sidelines and murmurs disapproval of his tactics and tearfully gazes at the distraught Clift . MAUREEN STAPLETON has a pivotal supporting role ( in her film debut ) , as a woman unhappily married to a cripple and badly in need of advice for the lovelorn . She's excellent . It works , up to a point , but seems more a dated curiosity piece than anything else . Taken from a Nathaniel West novel and a play , it suffers from too many speeches from Robert Ryan as he preaches his cynical hatred for mankind in a pretentious style similar to Ayn Rand's characters . Ultimately , the verdict has to be interesting but depressing .
446129	1048771	18037	5.0	Sentimental tale has historic value as a transition to sound . . .	To think that the world trembled when THE JAZZ SINGER was announced as a " talkie " musical and opened to huge crowds when it premiered , is to realize how far the cinema has come since this primitive showing . Actually , the story of THE JAZZ SINGER has a lot in common with Al Jolson's real saga told in THE JOLSON STORY . His cantor father was the Jewish man who opposed his singing anywhere but in the synagogue . In both films , the singer gives in to the lure of show business and eventually wins his father's approval . So much for the plot . A pristine print on TCM made viewing it a better experience than I expected , but it manages to be little more than a showcase for Al Jolson's specialty numbers . It began filming as a silent film with titles , but later the Vitaphone Orchestra was assigned to supply a full orchestral musical score for the background - - and they do an excellent job . But the faults lie in the acting which , for the most part , is still embedded in silent screen technique , which makes the scenes between mother and son excessively mawkish . WARNER OLAND , almost unrecognizable as a cantor with full beard , later went on to become the famous Chinese sleuth , Charlie Chan , in a series of movies . MARY McAVOY is the pleasant leading lady , a singer who encourages Jolson in his show business work , but the real star of the film is the Vitaphone Orchestra which , instead of sounding tinny ( as is often the case in early sound films ) , manages to sound reasonably full and rich in giving full sound to the instrumentals . Frankly , I enjoyed Jolson's vocals for THE JOLSON STORY ( he supplied the voice for Larry Parks ) , better than any of the singing he does here . His voice sounded fuller and richer in that later musical of the ' 40s .
447133	1048771	47199	5.0	Follow-up to " Miranda " is showcase for Glynis Johns . . .	I never saw MIRANDA but this is a lively sequel to that film with GLYNIS JOHNS again playing the saucy mermaid with her usual charm . Glynis is a flirtatious mermaid who takes the place of a schoolteacher for a couple of weeks , determined to find a better husband for her than the stuffy fiancé she's engaged to . They resemble each other greatly because , as " Miranda " describes it , they're both descended from the mermaid side of the family . It's utter nonsense , played to the hilt by a cast intent on making it reasonably funny but only partly succeeding . MARGARET RUTHERFORD overplays the role of a dotty nurse who looks after the mermaid and is in her element in over-the-top fantasy farce . DONALD SINDEN is a wealthy man Miranda has her eyes on as a possible husband for the schoolteacher . It's filmed in garish looking color ( unusual for a British film which usually featured muted color ) , but the charm begins to wear off fairly early as the plot gets sillier and sillier . Summing up : Mermaid comedies are not my cup of tea and this one is sillier than most , especially when the mermaid's inability to walk is compensated by some weak plot contrivances which has her being carried around by the men with her mermaid tail barely concealed under a thin blanket . Trivia note : Interesting to see JOAN HICKSON as the owner of a lodge , long before she became Jane Marple for British TV .
447921	1048771	43299	5.0	One small step up the ladder for Marilyn Monroe . . .	This is one of those conventional comedies of the ' 50s in which the righteous triumph over big bad corporate America , with MONTY WOOLLEY as a man who becomes indignant when forced to retire and goes about hatching a plan to draw attention to the subject of forced retirement . The theme isn't conventional , but the treatment is . Woolley gets to strut his stuff in scene after scene until the point becomes so obvious that you're willing to watch others in the cast who seem to be watching him on the sidelines . And there are some new faces to watch . David WAYNE , JEAN PETERS , RUSS TAMBLYN and newcomer MARILYN MONROE , who already had such a publicity build-up from Fox that many flocked to see the film because Marilyn was in it . She has a small , but choice role , as a curvy secretary who knows her effect on men . She shines ( glows is a better word ) in a charming small role . If you're a Monty Woolley fan and like his particular style of emoting ( acid-tongued and quick witted most of the time ) , you'll enjoy this , although it's certain a lesser work considering that it was written by Paddy Cheyefsky , who was then at the height of his writing powers .
445468	1048771	29864	5.0	Offbeat film has absurd central character in title role . . .	John Huston co-authored the script for THE AMAZING DR . CLITTERHOUSE and whatever fun he was having with the concept of a respected doctor who turns to crime in order to become a method criminologist by joining a hoodlum gang of thieves , it doesn't quite jell . At no time does director Anatole Litvak let us know that this is supposed to be a comedy or spoof of Warner gangster films . However , audiences must have found the idea more than a little offbeat to be taken seriously . Making things further unbelievable is the way CLAIRE TREVOR plays the gun moll with such intensity , but immediately takes a liking to the amazing doctor after opposing his very presence among them . Her shift to tender romantic feelings is blatantly unrealistic . HUMPHREY BOGART's role at least makes sense . He's the only gang member to take an instant dislike to the good doctor when he sees how assured he is in taking charge of things the moment he lands in the den of thieves . But the story takes a grim twist toward the end , dealing with Bogart's fate . Another absurd angle is the gang's willingness to have the doctor performing his blood tests on them as a part of his research project every time they go on a heist . Add to this the courtroom ending with some unbelievable happenings and you have a crime drama ( or is it a crime comedy ? ) , that rarely makes any sense and strains credibility at every turn . EDWARD G . ROBINSON is fine as the doctor and has one especially good scene where he plays cat-and-mouse with THURSTON HALL to find out whether the man will be willing to represent him at trial . Robinson , Bogart , Trevor and director Huston would all reunite ten years later for a much finer film - - KEY LARGO - - which utilized Trevor's talent in a much more rewarding way . At best , this is a curiosity that holds the interest but can make you impatient with the absurdity of it all .
446888	1048771	64782	5.0	Lee Marvin reprises his " Cat Ballou " characterization . . .	PAINT YOUR WAGON is one of the messiest musicals I've ever seen on screen , but there are a few compensations among the cast of non-singers in the principal roles . One , is getting to hear HARVE PRESNELL do a nice professional job on " They Call the Wind Maria " in one of the film's opening musical numbers - - and the only really great song in the show sung by a pro . Unfortunately for Presnell , he's hardly seen in the rest of the movie . The other halfway decent number is performed by CLINT EASTWOOD ( " I Talk to the Trees " ) but it's practically a throwaway . The other is the compensation for seeing LEE MARVIN reprise his " Cat Ballou " characterization all over again with a liquor bottle to his lips and the most impoverished looking costumes and make-up this side of skid row . He makes the most of his role as a scroungy looking boozer and even gets to recite some of the screenplay's wittier lines . And all of the rustic humor of the piece gets some nice backdrop with the Oregon scenery looming majestically in the background . But given the final pictorial result in rather muddy looking color , it wouldn't have mattered if the scenery was painted or not . Still another compensation : JEAN SEBERG looking lovely as the woman who has all the menfolk staring at her good looks ( there's a huge shortage of women in camp ) . She , Marvin and Eastwood are a pleasant trio and bring some energy and humor to their roles . But the songs by Fredrick Loewe are poorly integrated into the plot , most of them not even remotely approaching Loewe's earlier musical collaboration with Allan Jay Lerner . And worst of all , it's directed at a snail's pace by JOSHUA LOGAN who made such a mess of other Broadway hits , like SOUTH PACIFIC . Strangely enough , for a musical , there's no choreography to speak of - - the songs just seem to happen and most of them are highly forgettable , especially the " Gold " number sung in the mine . A nice ballad called " Wandrin ' Star " gets some nice male choral background treatment but has Lee Marvin talk / singing the lyrics . Two hours and forty-eight minutes is a long time devoted to a musical where only one professional singer is given a decent song to sing . This is the pits . As a comedy full of brawling gold-miners , it has some passable moments . As a musical , it just comes to a standstill for the songs and then lumbers on interminably until the " No Name Town " crumbles and falls into the earth like a modern Sodom getting its final destiny after a sinful existence . PAINT YOUR WAGON seems to exist in a strange no man's limbo , an uneven mixture of passable rustic comedy given a weak , almost bland musical score . No wonder that despite being given the roadshow treatment when it opened , it fizzled at the box-office .
445483	1048771	35460	5.0	Synthetic casting of MGM stars as lazy fishermen in seaport town . . .	There are two standout features of this film version of John Steinbeck's TORTILLA FLAT . One is the improbably beautiful HEDY LAMARR as a Portugese girl , showing more fire and spirit than usual in an unusual role ( for her ) . The other is FRANK MORGAN , who in an exquisite sequence set in a forest , does an unforgettable job as an old man who thinks his dogs have seen a vision . Other than that , it's pretty hard to accept SPENCER TRACY ( again assuming the sort of accent he had in CAPTAINS COURAGEOUS ) as the town's laziest and most conniving drifter , JOHN GARFIELD , SHELDON LEONARD and others as Latinos with Brooklyn accents showing , and AKIM TAMIROFF , the only supporting player who seems the least bit authentic . The story is almost non-existent , a minor trifle in which it's pretty obvious that the California fishing community has been filmed on studio soundstages at MGM with the actors often photographed against location shots filmed in northern California's Monterey . Definitely a Victor Fleming film that hasn't dated well and many will find offensive in its racial stereotypes . It's a wonder J . CARROL NAISH didn't find his way into the suppporting cast . He would have been a lot more believable than casting actors like ALLEN JENKINS and CONNIE GILCHRIST as Chicanos . An almost unrecognizable FRANK MORGAN deserved his Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination as The Pirate , a lazy , dog-loving eccentric whom Tracy tricks into revealing the whereabouts of his money . He's in the film's most memorable sequence but most of the film is slow and talky to an irritating degree and filled with unsympathetic characters .
446285	1048771	29845	5.0	Daffy comedy puts Lucy in some highly improbable situations . . .	Personally , I've always felt that the best comedies were the ones where you could actually believe in the situations - - in other words , the events are things that could have happened . THE AFFAIRS OF ANNABEL is funny in spots , but hasn't got a single moment that is in touch with reality . JACK OAKIE plays a scheming publicity man who dreams up the most outrageous ways of getting attention ( newspaper headlines ) for his fading star LUCILLE BALL , her film career supposedly on the wane . One plan involves getting her to spend three days in prison ( which turns out to be 30 days ) and to have the press on hand when she's released . The plan backfires , of course , and Lucy fires him . She rehires him when he gets a little old lady ( LEONA ROBERTS , Mrs . Meade from GWTW ) , to pretend to be his sick mother who needs money for an operation . Lucy relents and he comes up with another scheme - - her next film is called " The Maid and the Man " so he gets her work as a maid in a wacky household . It turns out the house has become the nest for two infamous criminals and Lucy , of course , gets into the thick of things while Oakie tries to rescue her by hiring fake police officers to storm the house . It had possibilities but emerges as a scatterbrained comedy without any real foothold on reality . THURSTON HALL is fun as a plate breaking scientist and RUTH DONNELLY has a few good one-liners as a studio receptionist , but other than that the gags are pretty hard to swallow at times . Best that can be said is that LUCILLE BALL shows skill at this sort of comedy and looks pert and pretty throughout . OAKIE overplays the press agent with outlandish schemes but is fun to watch . If you love Lucy , you'll find this acceptable fare but lacking in so many departments .
446886	1048771	29842	5.0	Comic book adventures of Polo on a lavish B & W budget . . .	This is the film that cost LANA TURNER ( in a bit role ) her eyebrows which never grew back . Other than that , it has no distinction whatsoever except that it provides a nice comic book excursion into the past with lavish sets of Oriental splendor but little else for compensation . Still , it's watchable enough thanks to the low-key and quietly humorous performance of GARY COOPER ( an unlikely choice for the role of the Italian adventurer from Venice ) . It's also interesting to watch SIGRID GURIE , fascinating in close-ups with Hollywood's brand of Oriental make-up - - but an actress who never managed to be more than a passing fancy . BASIL RATHBONE adds the right touch of menace as Ahmed , the villain of the piece , and ALAN HALE brings his boisterous presence to the role of a man who was afraid of his lecherous wife ( BINNIE BARNES ) but not afraid to dispose of his enemies in boiling oil . It gets more laughable as it goes on , but reaches new heights of incredibility with an ending that has Polo making use of explosives to bring down the enemy camp . His final fight to the death with Rathbone , near an open trap door with hungry lions waiting below and vultures overhead , is the stuff of comic book suspense . If you can suspend all disbelief long enough to enjoy it , it passes the time quickly and entertainingly . A history lesson , it's not .
447781	1048771	39865	5.0	Horses , horses everywhere . . . and hardly a story in sight . . .	RONALD REAGAN must have enjoyed his role in STALLION ROAD as a veterinarian . He spends most of his time on horses , as does his leading lady , ALEXIS SMITH , more tomboyish than usual and not the frozen ice princess she usually played . Not much plot development during the first half-hour , although it's obvious that city slicker novelist ZACHARY SCOTT is not going to wind up with Alexis . She has her eyes on Reagan from the start . It's not easy to care about the characters in this horse opera because none of them are well defined and there's so little going on at the start . Blame that on Stephen Longstreet . He wrote the screenplay from his novel of the same name . You know you're in trouble when the most exciting moment in the story is a high-jumping contest on horseback which Alexis wins against great odds . The balance of the story is involved with an anthrax outbreak which keeps Reagan busy tending to his horses . ZACHARY SCOTT wears a bored expression as the writer out of his element among horses , the kind of look he perfected in many a film , and this time it's understandable , although he does get some of the wittier lines in the script . PEGGY KNUDSEN has fun as Reagan's man-chasing neighbor with a catty dislike of rancher Alexis . Seems that she too is smitten with Reagan , who pays more attention to horses than women . If horses are your thing , you may enjoy this horse opera more than I did . Others beware - - it's strictly formula stuff . Reagan , in an uninteresting role , is more bland than usual as the doc .
446345	1048771	22180	5.0	Tiresome WWI romantic comedy / drama with William Boyd as the star . . .	Three carnival workers romance the same girl until WWI interferes with their plans . They join the Navy and the plot meanders all over the place with tiresome effect . WILLIAM BOYD ( later " Hopalong Cassidy " ) spouts his dialog in a slow-moving way , and ROBERT ARMSTRONG and JAMES GLEASON mug their way through some silly shenanigans as sailors looking for a good time . Boyd is the Chief Petty Officer who comes out of retirement to rejoin the service . GINGER ROGERS is the carnival gal who can't seem to decide whether to get serious about Boyd or not , until the finale . It's hopelessly contrived and full of hokey situations , dated dialog and interesting only for a glimpse of the Naval ships . Summing up : Totally unsatisfying from almost every standpoint .
445311	1048771	265080	5.0	Another " Dogville " short that humanizes dogs wearing costumes . . .	Some may find these shorts hilarious , but after the first few minutes it's clear that the dogs are being manipulated to assume the poses of animals talking to each other like humans , walking around on their hind legs and wearing costumes appropriate for the " characters " they're supposed to be playing . It's funny and amusing but hardly what I would call hilarious . The word " stilted " is more like it - - because it's all so obviously staged that the dogs seem more like puppets being led about by invisible strings . Having said that , if FRANCIS , THE TALKING MULE is your style of entertainment , you may fall over laughing at this nonsense . The dogs say grace at the table , fix a flat tire , go wild at a department store remnant sale , model clothes , cope with a crooked boss , and our hero and his girlfriend are separated when the boss pins a crime on the boy dog so that he can win the affection of the girl . After spending some time at the penitentiary , where some dogs are seen doing hard labor in jail clothes , the girl dog comes to the rescue and gets her boyfriend saved in time to avoid going to the chair for his crime . Says one dog to another when sampling jail food : " It ain't fit for a dog ! " Hilarius ? It depends .
446304	1048771	36306	5.0	Wartime musical waves patriotism and swings some music . . .	Built around a thin plot which serves as an excuse to parade a bunch of then current pop bands , singers and comedy acts , this little programmer from Columbia spotlights ANN MILLER in the central role as a disc jockey who directs her show at the U . S . Armed Services . She gets involved with two young soldiers - - WILLIAM WRIGHT ( who resembles John Carroll ) and DICK PURCELL , has frequent disagreements with her radio boss , and ends up as the feature attraction in a service show where she displays her tap-dancing skills . The plot , almost non-existent , serves as a prop to show some of the performers whose records she plays for the soldiers - - including Count Basie , Duke Wellington , Frank Sinatra , Bob Crosby , The Radio Rogues and The Mills Brothers . In a strictly subordinate role is LARRY PARKS , only a few years away from stardom in " The Jolson Story " , but here a virtual unknown as a fellow soldier . IRENE RYAN has a small role as a ditsy secretary . The acts are standard stuff , except for singer FRANK SINATRA who does a standout job on " Night and Day " and performs before the camera with remarkable ease and poise a few years before becoming a major film star . Pleasant WWII musical gets a lift from the musical numbers , but it's strictly second-rate as a substantial musical .
446765	1048771	500095	5.0	Sarah Brightman in full command of her lyric soprano . . .	I have nothing but admiration for the quality of SARAH BRIGHTMAN's high soprano voice , but have less complimentary things to say about her stage presence ( she looks like a frightened fawn with staring eyes and awkward hand gestures ) . Surely , she is someone who has spent a great deal of money on coaches and someone could certainly have pointed out that her limited gestures and unchanging expression ( no matter what song she sings ) detract from the luster of her singing voice . She appears to be humble and modest about her own talent , however , and this does come through - - also , she appreciates those who were enormously helpful in her career , such as ANDREW LLOYD WEBBER , who joins her in one rather brief segment at the piano while she sings his show tune , " Whistle Down the Wind " . And , of course , she does a brilliant vocal job on his songs from PHANTOM OF THE OPERA . She also joins forces with ANDREA BOCELLI in a couple of duets , does a fine job on " Les Filles de Cadiz " ( one of my favorite songs for soprano voice ) , and does some compelling work on numbers from WEST SIDE STORY . But the overall effect is offset by her lackluster and very one-dimensional stage presence - - which must have been somewhat a handicap when she played Christine opposite Michael Crawford in PHANTOM OF THE OPERA . At least there , her frightened expression made more sense . . . but it was Crawford who won all the awards and stole the show . Nor is it possible to close without remarking that her enunciation of words is hindered by the pear-shaped tones she produces so diligently . Most of her words , however , are obscured .
447734	1048771	491005	5.0	The ravens are mad for human flesh . . .	In what appears to be a feeble rip-off of THE BIRDS , KAW stars SEAN PATRICK FLANERY as a man about to serve his last day as sheriff of a sleepy town when some nasty business involving black ravens preying on people comes to his attention . Naturally , he has to do something about it - - and then the fun begins . What's so irritating about this one is that everyone seems to deliberately do the wrong thing in order to cause even more hell to break loose . Either careless with their guns or thinking they can shoot a couple of ravens and emerge without a scratch - - not knowing that each " kaw " brings hundreds more to the scene . But the main trouble with KAW is that none of the people are the least bit interesting . In this kind of thriller , you have to care about the participants . Even SEAN PATRICK FLANERY as the brave sheriff doing his duty to protect the townspeople is as bland as can be . Let's face it , he's no ROD TAYLOR who played Hitchcock's hero in THE BIRDS . And unfortunately , Rod Taylor has a small role here as Doc , looking more like character actor Walter Brennan than Rod Taylor . He was just about unrecognizable to me until I realized I'd seen his name in the cast . Whatever , age has certainly caused a transformation in his looks . As for the story , it starts slowly but the moment it gets into the more frantic movements of the ravens , it goes into a frenzy of screaming hysteria from the girls on the bus and elsewhere dominating the movie until the end . If you enjoy listening to screams , this one's for you . Summing up : Some passable CGI effects and overall good photography but everyone is let down by a weak script and poorly developed characters .
447327	1048771	44916	5.0	Something went wrong with " the formula " . . . only Marilyn shines . . .	The cast includes some of the top masters of screwball comedy and is directed by the man who made BRINGING UP BABY - - and yet this is not the bright and witty farce it strains to be . Ironically , it's MARILYN MONROE , in the film's smallest role as a dimwit secretary , who steals the spotlight from CARY GRANT , GINGER ROGERS and CHARLES COBURN whenever she pops up . . . which isn't often enough . Superstardom was just around the corner and this film is proof that Monroe had the kind of charisma that charms even when her dialog is not that funny . CARY GRANT does well in most of his scenes but the Indian romp with the boys is too unbelievable even for this far-fetched comic spoof . At times , he seems almost detached from his role . Poor HUGH MARLOWE looks mighty uncomfortable as a victim of the " let's play Indian " stunt . So much so , that one can only picture him wishing he was back in ALL ABOUT EVE . GINGER ROGERS has an irritating sequence where she and Cary revisit their honeymoon hotel with disastrous results when she goes into a crying jag over the mention of her mother's name . Ginger only perks up when imitating an even more youthful version of her " Major and the Minor " role - - but she is given only brief moments to shine . Coburn plays his role effortlessly and is especially amusing when referring to his secretary's lack of skills . " Anyone can type " , he says of Monroe as she wriggles away . But true wit is missing for most of the film and the laughs come at the expense of the two main stars who show a surprising lack of chemistry when thrown together . The formula just doesn't work here . Something went wrong and it shows .
447899	1048771	25117	5.0	Another old-fashioned look at debutantes in the ' 30s . . .	FINISHING SCHOOL starts with a whimper : FRANCES DEE enters the same finishing school her mother ( BILLIE BURKE ) attended , a school burdened by rules that most of the girls never follow - - including Dee's new roommate , GINGER ROGERS . And it doesn't end with a bang . BEULAH BONDI is the prissy lady who tells Dee about all the rules . ANNE SHIRLEY is a naive girl who wants to be part of the gang but is rebuffed by Ginger's set . The dialog is not exactly crackling with gems . " One step lower and I'll be in the movies , " says one old gal who deceives the school mistress by playing the good aunt taking the girls to a matinée instead of a wild week-end rendezvous with men . When Dee passes out on her wild weekend , it's BRUCE CABOT , a waiter at the hotel , to her rescue . He pays a passing milkman 12 cents for a quart of milk so Dee can have some breakfast . Oh , the good old days ! ! Even with some good names in the supporting cast , it never manages to be more than an innocuous treatment of an innocuous theme . Dee is pretty but her acting , as usual , is pretty forgettable . Bruce Cabot does well enough in one of his few likable roles as a young man studying to be an intern while waiting tables on the side . As for Ginger Rogers , at least she adds a little spice as Dee's friend . Watchable but underwhelming as a feature that probably played the lower half of double bills in the ' 30s .
446429	1048771	829182	5.0	Spiritual fable marred by some odd casting . . .	THE GREATEST GIFT is a simplistic fable about a juggler ( EDMUND GWENN ) who is on his way to earn money at an Italian fair when he falls ill and is taken in by some monks who nurse him back to health . They are preparing for a festival honoring the Virgin Mary and each is making a suitable gift for an offering . Encouraged to stay until the fair is over , Gwenn is unable to think of anything he can offer except for his juggling apparatus . This idea is scornfully rejected by HANS CONREID and LUMSDEN HARE , so he uses another approach that seems to work a miracle . Unfortunately , Edmund Gwenn seems a bit out of place as the juggler , donned in a page boy dark wig that only accentuates his inappropriate age . And Hans Conreid , as the skeptic , looks oddly out of place in the monastery setting when he's associated mainly with wild and wacky comedy roles . But with these reservations aside , it's a watchable enough short subject that is heartwarming if a bit overly sentimental in its tale of Christian faith .
446927	1048771	29350	5.0	Abstract art accompanies " Hungarian Rhapsody " . . .	I appreciated the soundtrack more than the abstract art , patterns of balloon-shaped dots that dance across the screen for six minutes while the 2nd Hungarian Rhapsody explodes with musical sounds . After a few minutes , the short becomes too repetitious to be really novel . In fact , it's the sort of thing the Disney studio was already experimenting with and led to several short subjects , as well as the full-length feature " Fantasia " later on , combining classical music with unique animation . But this was 1937 and the comparison to Disney was not made at the time . Nevertheless , I found it monotonous to watch and not unique enough , except for the exhilarating classical music performed .
446996	1048771	25452	5.0	Primitive by today's standards . . . inferior to Hitch's ' 56 remake . . .	Hitchcock believed , with good reason , that his first version of THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH was " amateurish " ( his own words ) and felt he could do more justice to the story by giving it a modern remake with Bernard Herrmann's magnificent music adding dimension to the suspense . He even used Herrmann as a conductor for the Albert Hall concert sequence - - which is much more complex in execution than it is in this version and changed the setting for the story . In this version , however , that sequence is probably the most Hitchcockian of all the scenes in the movie with some clever editing touches . LESLIE BANKS and EDNA BEST are nowhere as charismatic as James Stewart and Doris Day in the ' 56 version . The opening scenes are crude enough to be laughable and Peter Lorre's villainy was much more refined once he understood the English language , instead of learning his part phonetically , as he did here . Furthermore , the shootout at the end is not only awkwardly staged but is undercut by the unrealistic sound effects of dummy bullets . Edna Best is less than convincing as a sharpshooter for that final scene . The whole rooftop scene is excruciatingly amateurish as a wrap-up for the story . Clumsy ending . And it must be said that all of the events leading up to the scene in the church tabernacle , are more than a little absurd . Hitchcock tried to get comic effect out of some of these scenes , to little effect . The strain shows . It's a story that cried for a remake - - and Hitchcock did a marvelous job of visualizing it as a highly successful vehicle for James Stewart and Doris Day years later in exotic settings and more realistic touches to the story with the villains not appearing like stock caricatures , but humanized . Summing up : Hitchcock was right to remake it as a much better film .
447515	1048771	5310	5.0	Enjoyable short film has some clever touches . . .	I'm sure FATTY ARBUCKLE and MABEL NORMAND deserved their popularity back in 1915 when silents were attracting audiences to this new thing called " the movies " , but frankly it's easy to dismiss it today as little more than a nostalgic look at Hollywood's primitive beginnings . Both are likable enough and the set-up is good for laughs , as they visit a park and interact with an organ grinder and his monkey . This leads to the scenes were Mabel is alone at home letting her imagination run away her and suspecting that the gangster described in the newspaper is trying to get into her home . The mysterious quiver of the drapes frightens her for awhile , until the moment arrives when the organ grinder himself dares to part the curtains and reveal the culprit to be his monkey . What strikes me most about the early silent films is the tackiness of the sets , not to mention the unbelievable bad taste in set decoration and furnishings . This is especially true here , as Mabel's house is a house of horrors as far as " set decoration " is concerned . Summing up : Watchable but certainly not the best of the duo's collaborations .
446096	1048771	29158	5.0	Tepid , pointless remake is no improvement on the original . . .	TCM's " Lost and Found " series of RKO films continues with yet another remake of RAFTER ROMANCE ( with Ginger Rogers and Norman Foster ) , the story of two people who never meet although they're roommates sharing the same flat . They never meet because they're on different work shifts . It's a story that worked its charm with Ginger but doesn't seem to have the same snap here . It's familiar ground and this time serves as a vehicle for JAMES DUNN and WHITNEY BOURNE with some comic assistance from FRANKLIN PANGBORN and JOAN WOODBURY . Pangborn has the Robert Benchley role of the lecherous wolf but is slightly less credible with his prissy attitude . These Depression-era comedies are really hard to relate to today , what with $15 a month rent being a hardship that has to be shared by another . It was a different world in 1937 - - and clearly , the Depression wasn't quite over . At any rate , this is practically a scene by scene remake of RAFTER ROMANCE with no noticeable improvement in dialog , style or pace . In other words , it's pointless . Every aspect of the flimsy and familiar plot is badly dated , and the pranks that the two unknown roommates play on each other are more mean spirited than funny . The animal prank scenes ( which did not take place in the original ) are beyond ridiculous . Nor are any of the other changes an improvement under the feeble direction of Lew Landers . Summing up : Watch the original and forget this one . It's a real loser .
446751	1048771	36776	5.0	As daffy as any Marx Brothers comedy - - a farce about crowded Washington , D . C . in wartime . . .	I was so busy watching ANN SHERIDAN looking so great that I had a hard time keeping track of the zany plot . She really had a flair for comedy , even this kind of absurd farce , that it's a shame she was never given better scripts . JANE WYMAN plays the sort of dumb blonde that made Marilyn famous ( only she's a brunette here ) - - but she too is saddled with overly dumb remarks that even JACK Carson has a hard time swallowing . And ALEXIS SMITH proves that behind that frozen puss she has a real sense of humor . Catch the scene where she stoops to telling a tale of woe in a Brooklyn accent ! Incidentally , her boyfriend in the film is the man she eventually married in real life - - CRAIG REYNOLDS . I don't fault the actors . CHARLES RUGGLES is actually quite good as a businessman attracted to Wyman . And character actor JOHN RIDGELY gets to play a prominent supporting role as Sheridan's fiancé with a good deal of amiable charm and skill . For these reasons alone , the film is worth watching despite the over-baked ham . But beware of most of the farce , which is directed with the finesse of a sledgehammer bearing down on all the lines , emphasized by big close-ups of the cast in wide-eyed reaction shots in case we don't get the point . It's another in a number of wartime films ( WWII ) emphasizing the overcrowded hotel conditions in Washington , D . C . from the very opening shot - - similar to " The More the Merrier " and " Government Girl . " Terribly overdone , downright hammy performances from everyone including EVE ARDEN as " a Russian Sergeant York " who shoots her rifle from the terrace . Jane Wyman's character gets annoying after the first few remarks and from then on I kept my eyes on Sheridan . Her reactions are priceless , if a bit over-the-top . Trivia note : MARK STEVENS has only a couple of lines to say during one of the crowded hotel scenes as Reynolds ' Army friend and NATALIE SCHAEFER has no lines at all as a woman holding a baby .
446623	1048771	40627	5.0	Another in the " Rusty " series with an obvious message . . .	From the outset , the viewer has to be aware that this is a story about the boy who cried Wolf once too often , so that no one believed him when the wolf actually attacked . It's a message wrapped up tidily in a harmless little programmer from Columbia , MY DOG RUSTY , again starring TED DONALDSON as the boy who seems incapable of staying out of trouble until the happy ending . This time he's a meddler in the affairs of a woman doctor ( MONA BARRIE ) and her experiments on bacteria-laden water and , even more importantly , in the affairs of his father ( JOHN LITEL ) who has a hard time running for mayor when his son is accused of being a liar . The dog " Rusty " does a commendable job of looking interested in whatever is going on , although there are times when he seems to be acting strictly on cue from a man on the sidelines who gets a full share of glances when the camera is turning . He's not , in my opinion , in the same league with MGM's famous collie , Lassie . The kids all sound like kids reading their lines for the first time and only Donaldson delivers a fairly natural performance as the boy who learns all of his lessons the hard way . It passes the time quickly and obviously was designed to fill the second half of a double bill back in the good old days of double features . ANN DORAN is again the boy's protective mother , but JOHN LITEL has the biggest part as the boy's occasionally stern parent baffled by his son's growing up years .
445843	1048771	36705	5.0	Charlie Chan and black magic . . . routine entry . . .	The only ingredient of BLACK MAGIC that is any different from the other Chan films is the amount of time given to MANTAN MORELAND as the frightened wide-eyed black man who serves as comedy relief . A few of the gags are amusing enough , but it's a one joke routine that wears thin after the first half-hour . SIDNEY TOLER is the Chinese detective , this time abetted by his daughter ( FRANCES CHAN ) as they attempt to find the truth about some weird happenings at a seance run by JACQUELINE DeWITT . There are the usual dumb detectives on the case , always outsmarted by Chan who always knows much more information about the killer at lodge than we do . It's typical Charlie Chan in a story without much scope and definitely just another low-budget entry in the series - - and certainly nothing out of the ordinary . The only real difference , as stated above , is the emphasis on humor .
447730	1048771	51744	5.0	Silly William Castle fright film is as stale as week old bread . . .	Only the kiddies could possibly find anything really scary or original about this obvious and contrived fright film on a cheapie William Castle budget , THE HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL . Despite the fact that it features VINCENT PRICE as an eccentric millionaire who challenges a flock of guests to spend the night in his haunted mansion ( and survive ) , it's got all the flavor of amateur night with performances ranging from bad to really bad . Of course , the title alone is enough to encourage some viewers to think they'll get some real scares - - but it's a title that never lives up to the promise of something really haunting . Instead , we have chandeliers crashing , heads turning up in boxes , and some foaming vat of acid bubbling in the cellar while the guests lurk around in such stupid fashion that they seem to deserve their grisly fates . Unworthy of Vincent Price , an actor who did do a number of good horror films . This is not one of them . Strictly third-rate stuff , even for Halloween .
447686	1048771	382625	6.0	Pulp fiction . . . ordinary thriller given too much attention because of controversial theme . . .	If you approach watching a film like THE DA VINCI CODE as a thriller ( and forget all the mumble jumble about the history of the Roman Catholic Church ) , it works on an elementary level . The background score ( a very busy one ) by Hans Zimmer gives it the required element of suspense even when two characters are merely giving you a lot of exposition to make the plot easier to follow . Unfortunately , it would take someone more familiar with this material to truly enjoy the movie as a serious look at the dark side of Christianity and its symbols that never quite make complete sense . And so , I will review the film on the level of a thriller that has added a controversial theme to attract a large audience ready to put on its thinking cap and at least ponder what might have been . Ron Howard has seen to it that the controversial elements have been toned down considerably from the book , without eliminating them entirely . But on the debit side , most of the photography is too dark ( intentionally so , I presume to keep an air of mystery going ) , the explanations come at a slow pace but there are too many to keep the plot from moving forward the way it should in a thriller of this kind , and the acting is , for the most part , not extraordinary . TOM HANKS gives a very understated performance in a role that is , for the most part , rather bland . He plays the role straight , without any emphasis on his lighter side , but one almost wishes for some trace of wit or humor in the role . His French cohort AUDREY TAUTOU has an accent that makes some of her key words undecipherable ( at least to me ) in a film where every bit of relevant material needs to be handed to the viewer who wants to catch all the clues . Only Ian McKellen sparkles in a supporting role , bringing flashes of humor and intelligence to a well-written role . Alfred Molina as a Bishop has little opportunity to be more than slightly interesting . The most striking and intense supporting role goes to Paul Bettany as Silas , the albino who has his own interpretation of what he must do to please the Lord . He has a few masochistic scenes that dole out the required chills and he has a look of quiet menace and desperation in his eyes . All in all , I'd say this should please readers of the book . Howard has done as good a job as possible with the bulky twists and turns of the novel and translated a popular work of pulp fiction into a movie that will undoubtedly be seen by audiences looking for a summer blockbuster . Summing up : A good workmanlike job by a movie that really doesn't ask the viewer to take it too seriously . It's more like an espionage thriller with a dose of religiosity thrown in .
447667	1048771	30657	6.0	Her charm was still there but the stories were wearing thin . . .	REBECCA OF SUNNYBROOK FARM owes whatever charm it has to its leading lady ( SHIRLEY TEMPLE was still the number one box-office attraction in America ) and a modest but pleasing supporting cast . However , it's obvious that nobody paid much attention to the original story and what we're left with is a rather threadbare story mixing Shirley with her show biz talent background . And along the way , Bill Robinson gets lost in the shuffle of background characters , with only William Demarest enlivening the proceedings with his pratfalls and Helen Westley with her grumpy old maid . Edna May Oliver must have been busy . Aside from the star , GLORIA STUART does nicely as a leading lady for RANDOLPH SCOTT - - the two make a handsome pair . Stuart never got her big break in these sort of films but was certainly a stunning blonde in her day with very fine features . Scott seems a little standoffish , not cast in his regular western mode , perhaps even a little uncomfortable in his scenes with Shirley . Shirley has a change of hairdo ( away with all those curls ) but just to make sure her audience won't pine for the good old days , she delivers some of her old song numbers with customary ease . It has to be noted , though , that her singing voice ( although on key ) was always very slight indeed . She fares much better in the few tap routines she does , always with that big smile and cheery presence . Not one of the best Temple films , but OK . Franklin Pangborn is fun as a nervous stand-in who gets his big chance and blows it .
447111	1048771	1404376	6.0	Demolitions and natural disasters caught by the candid camera . . .	Some interesting glimpses of natural disasters and demolition projects are revealed in THE CAMERA CAUGHT IT . It starts with the weather , scenes of heavy snowfalls and even heavier rains making life unbearable for humans and animals ; a demolition project with the crowd anticipating the blast ; men trying to " emulate the birds " by flying off a bridge in a man-made contraption that promptly sinks into the water or a man with a " sky flying machine " who gets nowhere fast except for vibrating up and down in his inventive jalopy . An auto race in which one of the cars turns into a flaming torch ( nobody was killed ) while other cars swerve to avoid the flames and all of them providing spectators with a number of crashes . And finally , a suspension bridge the narrator calls " Galloping Gertie , " swerving to and fro as though pushed by a heavy breeze until it finally loses its grip and falls into the water . Quite an eyeful of candid moments caught by the camera . The mushroom cloud that swirls around after a building demolition is an eerie reminder for today's viewer of what happened when the Twin Towers fell on .
446112	1048771	65206	6.0	" How does your garden grow ? " might have been a better title . . .	Lots of mordant humor and a clever plot twist at the end are sufficient reason for watching WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO AUNT ALICE ? , but when a cast includes GERALDINE PAGE , RUTH GORDON and MILDRED DUNNOCK and promises to be a suspenseful film along the lines of BABY JANE and HUSH . . . HUSH , SWEET CHARLOTTE , you owe it to yourself to watch it . It works not so much because the story ( an eerie one , to be sure ) is so original , but because the cat-and-mouse aspect of the story which has Geraldine Page and Ruth Gordon as adversaries in a household fraught with suspicion ( of murder ) , is what hooks the most interest in this vastly entertaining little shocker . However , it's a quiet one , building its suspense slowly as we come to realize just how manipulative and cunning Page's character is . She's a woman , believing her husband has left her penniless , who moves to Arizona where she will be near her nephew . But she's intent on hiring lonely housekeepers and murdering them to steal their savings . ( Not unlike some real-life events depicted in a gruesome TV documentary recently ) . After disposing of her victims she buries them in her garden and plants another tree to mark the spot . It seems they flourish nicely , hence my suggestion above for a better title . Gordon pretends to apply for a job after the last housekeeper has gone missing and is actually doing some detective work on her own . It's her scenes with Page that make the whole film so satisfying . It's not a great horror film but it does have its moments , thanks mostly to GERALDINE PAGE who does a marvelous job at showing us all the tics and nuances of a very eccentric woman who means to get her way , no matter what she has to do . It's a ruthless , cunning role and Page makes the most of it .
446724	1048771	43813	6.0	Sassy comedy has Thelma Ritter in rare leading role . . .	Whatever merit THE MODEL AND THE MARRIAGE BROKER has is due entirely to the caustic , funny performance of Thelma Ritter as Mae , the lady with the New York accent who went into the broker business to make other ladies happy ( after her own unhappy romantic past ) . And it's a good thing Thelma carries the film , with the expert help of a few very good character roles - - one in particular being MICHAEL O'SHEA , as a card-playing friend prone to giving her advice . SCOTT BRADY does a nice job as an eligible bachelor who shares some good scenes with Ritter and JEANNE CRAIN . But Jeanne Crain is the problem . She looks so cool and detached as the unhappy model that it throws the comedy aspects a little off focus . She seems to be walking through her part instead of conveying any real emotion . Still , a worthwhile little gem strictly because of Thelma Ritter . She's finally got a leading role and she runs away with it . Nicely directed at a brisk pace by George Cukor .
445858	1048771	365247	6.0	Best segment has Sinatra reunited with Gene Kelly . . .	Sinatra came out after retirement , at age 57 , to do another of his concerts , this time backed by the wonderful Gordon Jenkins and Dan Costa and with guest star GENE KELLY , at age 61 . Frankie starts off with a standard called YOU WILL BE MY MUSIC before getting into some oldies like I GET NO KICK FROM CHAMPAGNE , STREET OF DREAMS , I'VE GOT YOU UNDER MY SKIN , I'VE GOT THE WORLD ON A STRING and LAST NIGHT WHEN WE WERE YOUNG . His voice is not quite as mellow as it was in the past and he doesn't hold onto the end notes the way he used to , but he's still in good form and the band sounds great . You can spot some celebrities in the audience , including Richard Conte and Lucille Ball . He talks briefly about films he'd rather forget - - like HIGHER AND HIGHER , JOHNNY CONCHO , THE KISSING BANDIT ( that one got lots of laughs ) , and the " one about the cannon " - - you know , THE PRIDE AND THE PASSION with Cary Grant and Sophia Loren . Then comes the best part of the program - - his easiness and charm comes through as he greets his guest , GENE KELLY , after clips from " Take Me Out to the Ball Game " and " Anchors Aweigh " are shown . They both start to talk about the old days at MGM and sing a little ditty called " We Can't Do That Any More " , but little by little they ease into some dance steps and before you know it , Gene Kelly is doing some good taps ( without getting too strenuous ) and so is Frank . Another great moment comes when Frank sings " Nice and Easy Does It " while Gene goes into his dance , up and down steps , but mostly taking it easy . At the end of this number , they both get huge applause . Frankie ends his show with " Let Me Try Again " and the beautiful ballad , " Send in the Clowns " ( which I myself performed publicly a few times ) . For the finale , a reprise , this time the complete song of YOU WILL BE MY MUSIC and the show ends . Summing up : Nice work by Frank and Gene , and especially the skillful and scintillating sounds of that orchestra on all of the music .
445750	1048771	880018	6.0	Groucho talks , sings , and smokes his cigar while Cavett listens . . .	Enjoyable talk show moments from the late ' 60s with GROUCHO MARX doing his thing while reminiscing about his films , some of the people he worked with or knew during his movie days , including IRVING THALBERG , MARGARET DUMONT , CHICO MARX and GRETA GARBO . DICK CAVETT sits back and lets Groucho take the show in any direction he wants , which includes three of his favorite songs : " Lydia , the Tattooed Lady " , " Father's Day " and " Everybody Works But Father . " Groucho recalls that Irving Thalberg was such a difficult man to get to see ( even when one had an appointment , since Thalberg was usually working on four films at a time ) , that he and his brothers had to play a practical joke on Thalberg to get his attention . From then on , Thalberg never kept them waiting . He also tells an amusing anecdote about GRETA GARBO ( their encounter in an elevator ) , and talks about how MARGARET DUMONT was able to be a straight woman for all his jokes because she never understood what they were all about . The audience gets its share of laughs - - not canned laughter , believe me - - and every time they guffaw at one of Grouch's one-liners , Cavett just sits back and enjoys the spectacle of watching Groucho at work . Lots of fun .
445486	1048771	359476	6.0	Edgy characters make interesting background for murder . . .	NATHANIEL PARKER and SHARON SMALL are not exactly a plausible pair as detectives , but the script makes use of their odd personality quirks and provides a few moments of genuine humor . The plot concerns the death of a young cricket player and the assorted characters who had something to do with his rather unhappy past . The performances are all first rate , especially NEVE McINTOSH as Olivia , a young woman who holds the secret to what really happened when the man was murdered . NATHANIEL PARKER lends his strong presence to the role of Inspector Lynley and is believable as a man determined to get to the bottom of a messy murder . All the red herrings are nicely planted . Well done in good British style .
447335	1048771	841024	6.0	Investigating the death of Emily Proctor . . .	In this well-written , fast-moving British series , NATHANIEL PARKER and SHARON SMALL ( as Inspector Lynley and Sgt . Havers ) investigate the mysterious death of a young woman . As in all of these crime stories , their investigation is full of lots of red herrings ( a la Agatha Christie ) , wherein there are a substantial number of suspects , a few of whom seem to be slightly unhinged . The plot ingredients include an abusive step-father , a mistreated woman protecting her innocent sister , a man whose sweetheart was killed just before their wedding and who is suspected of having a hand in this latest death , and a woman seeking revenge on any woman who wants to marry the man she admires . It's all done very effectively with clue after clue being examined skillfully by the probing Inspector Lynley , played with the right mixture of sensitivity and determination by Nathaniel Parker . Enjoyable episode is well worth watching with good insight into human character traits .
448086	1048771	70291	6.0	Sondheim and Perkins wrote a modern Agatha Christie yarn . . .	Any fan of Agatha Christie will recognize her format in the plot outline of THE LAST OF SHIELAH . Have some old codger ( JAMES COBURN ) invited five disparate personalities aboard his yacht for a game of " Clue " ( although he doesn't tell them that ) , let the bold accusations and one-liners go back and forth between these sophisticated show biz people , have one of them murdered , get a room full of suspects for the final quiz - - and voila , you have THE LAST OF SHIELAH , with most of the loose ends neatly tied up - - almost . But for some , there will still be some head scratching going on when the finale comes and it's not a bad idea to view this one again . And why not ? It's so full of sarcastic or bitchy lines ( most of them , courtesy of DYAN CANNON who plays the boldest dame ) , with others getting a fair share of some ripe digs too - - RICHARD BENJAMIN , JOAN HACKETT , RAQUEL WELCH , IAN McSHANE and JAMES MASON . It's one of those contrived mystery who-dun-its that keeps you guessing until the end , but the puzzle is fun while it lasts . Summing up : Smart , funny , stylish entertainment .
446474	1048771	112966	6.0	Charmingly irrelevant film about a mountain and a molehill . . .	Despite the fact that it's about almost nothing relevant to the average movie-goer , THE ENGLISHMAN WHO WENT UP A HILL BUT CAME DOWN A MOUNTAIN manages to be a charming diversion but ultimately , it's as innocuous as its title . Drawbacks aside , it does offer some hauntingly beautiful color cinematography of Welsh landscapes , day and night , blazing with beauty , some quaint village shots of pubs and lodgings that look invitingly cosy , and some sketchy characterizations that do little more than pad out a rather tedious little tale . HUGH GRANT does another one of his befuddled , amused , eyebrow lifting characterizations , complete with stutter and smile and pause between words , a role he seemed destined to repeat again and again . But he fits the role and the story - - which takes place in 1917 Wales . The jaunty musical score compensates for some slow moments but all the actors do a competent job of keeping things on a realistic level . There are no big names in the cast aside from Grant , but they all make their mark while he gets most of the footage for a rather awkward romance with a local girl who spends the night on the mountain with him . Summing up : Not much in the way of a plot , but it manages to be appealing and extremely well photographed .
447658	1048771	368891	6.0	The Da Vinci Code in a minor key . . . more humor , more fun . . .	If your head is still spinning from all the murky codes being deciphered in THE DA VINCI CODE , you can sit back and relax with all the clues NICHOLAS CAGE has to unravel in order to go on his treasure hunt in NATIONAL TREASURE . He has lots of help from his dad ( JON VOIGT ) , a very savvy female assistant ( DIANE KRUGER ) , his mentor ( CHRISTOPHER PLUMMER ) , and his goofy but handsome side-kick ( JUSTIN BARTHA ) . The heist scenes involving a stolen Declaration of Indpendence are a highlight of the film , all filmed on actual locales in and around Washington , D . C . and Philadelphia , handsomely photographed . Cage gets some stiff resistance from HARVEY KEITEL as a no-nonsense FBI man , and some villainous competition from greedy SEAN BEAN and his henchmen , who want the treasure for monetary purposes only and will stop at nothing , even murder , to lay their greedy hands on it . It's all Saturday matinée stuff , the plot strictly a mixture of Indiana Jones and other cliffhanger stories where the hero has to pursue his quest while all sorts of obstacles are thrust in his way - - and then the final , climactic shoot-out and wild chase before he can walk off with the girl at the end of the movie . All the standard clichés are firmly in place , but it's still a lot of fun to watch NICHOLAS CAGE interact with a fun loving cast . SEAN BEAN lends some British dignity to his role as the charming villain , not quite as dark a villain as is usual in these sort of capers . There's a light touch throughout all the heist sequences and chases and explorations of the underground caverns holding the treasure , as well as some well staged moments of suspense with collapsing stairways and termite-ridden wooden structures making the search perilous . JUSTIN BARTHA contributes a lot of the lighter jibes as a computer wiz who is clearly having a good time and knows the whole thing is a lark as he works on his computer graphics . Nothing too original here , but it's purely an escapist adventure yarn .
447437	1048771	34928	6.0	Artistic triumph of Technicolor photography and realistic looking jungle settings . . .	Although THE JUNGLE BOOK seems to limp along at a slow pace , it catches the eye with its splendid Technicolor photography of lush forests , a brilliantly staged forest fire and the " Lost City " where hidden treasure drives men to greed and destruction . Close-ups of the jungle animals are beautifully shot and all of their scenes are well staged . As Mowgli , the boy raised by wolves , SABU has the fierce looks of a wolf-child , although he does learn to converse in English awfully soon , thanks to some choppy editing continuity . ROSEMARY DeCAMP is his mother , beaming at him with adoration and accepting the fact at the end that he must return to the forest kingdom where he rules rather than stay with man . Joseph CALLEIA is terrific as one of the greedy pursuers of gold , marking Sabu's trail so he can find " The Lost City . " JOHN QUALEN too is excellent in another supporting role . Miklos Rozsa's music is not given sufficient strength on the soundtrack , muffled behind all of the dialog and jungle sounds , so it doesn't get its due despite some good orchestrations . It sounds better on recorded excerpts from the film . A fantasy from my childhood that doesn't register as strongly as it did back then but still manages to hold the interest with its visually arresting sets created by Vincent Korda . TCM is showing a better Technicolor print of the film than was released in the Public Domain version years ago , which was nominated for four Oscars including one for its color cinematography .
446166	1048771	264935	6.0	So-so yarn spins to a cliffhanger climax . . . not Sandra's best . . .	When it deals exclusively with the two misguided teens ( Michael Pitt and Ryan Gosling ) , their classroom scenes , their conspiracy , their tense relationship , the movie springs to life . When it focuses on Sandra Bullock as a detective with Ben Chaplin as her assistant , it falters badly . First of all , Bullock's character is not understandable until one learns her whole story - - but even then , it doesn't let us like her . She's definitely not the usual Sandra Bullock sympathetic character here , and , in fact , as the central character in the story , she's rather unlikeable from beginning to end . Nor does the script give Ben Chaplin much to do except look as if he'd rather be elsewhere , especially since he has to put up with the shenanigans of his most unlikely partner . Bullock is better suited to romantic comedies than serious character roles . But the boys are wonderful , a Leopold and Loeb sort of pair , who plan the perfect murder and then let things fall apart when they find themselves up against a determined female detective who sees through them from the start . Slowly paced , the whole thing would have worked better as a one hour crime drama on television . But the charismatic performances of Pitt and Gosling are well worth watching . They're both completely believable as the pair of misguided youths . Gosling is superb as a master of casual menace - - grinning and smoothly avoiding detection even when under pressure - - until the finale . They are far more charismatic than the nominal leads , Bullock and Chaplin .
447059	1048771	35770	6.0	Nurses struggle with battle conditions on Philippines during WWII . . .	CRY HAVOC follows in the tradition of films like SO PROUDLY WE HAIL by dealing exclusively with nurses in the Philippines on active duty during WWII . MARGARET SULLAVAN is the lieutenant in charge of a group of gals including ANN SOTHERN , ELLA RAINES , FRANCES GIFFORD and JOAN BLONDELL , all of whom are inexperienced but have to learn the ropes fast during wartime bombardments . Based on a play , it barely shows its stage origins and presents a gritty story of nurses under stress doing the best they can under dire circumstances . MARGARET SULLAVAN and FAY BAINTER fret over having to deal with " wet-nosed kids " ( as Sullavan calls them ) , all of them eventually becoming battle hardened after working conditions continually put them in harm's way . Watch for ROBERT MITCHUM in a brief unbilled bit as a dying soldier . Sullavan and Sothern argue over Sothern's infatuation for a man Sullavan loves and there's some trite dialog among the all-female cast when they get to exchange stories - - but it's still an above average melodrama of women nurses during war . Summing up : Worth it for the gritty wartime bombardments and interesting cast , but don't expect anything great . Richard Thorpe's direction keeps the pace steadfast without too many lulls until the downbeat ending .
445694	1048771	39589	6.0	Uneven thriller with top notch cast . . .	LURED starts out promisingly with Scotland Yard on the trail of a serial killer and enlisting a friend of the latest victim ( LUCILLE BALL ) to help them solve the crime . CHARLES COBURN is the police inspector who sends Lucille on a dangerous mission to trap a killer . GEORGE SANDERS , in one of his more colorless roles , is the man with romantic designs on Ball the minute he has a phone conversation with her when she applies for a showgirl job opening . Sanders without witty dialog plays his straight role in a rather bored fashion , but there's some colorful work by ALAN MOBRAY , SIR CEDRIC HARDWICKE , GEORGE ZUCCO , ROBERT COOTE and ALAN NAPIER . Best of all is BORIS KARLOFF in an offbeat role as a mad dress designer who gets the chance to chew all the scenery in sight and then some . But somewhere towards the middle , the story loses steam and whatever dramatic tension was built up in the earlier scenes . Still , it manages to hold the interest with several red herrings tossed in the mix to throw off suspicion . However , any true mystery fan ought to be able to guess the murderer from the start . Best when it's going along at a brisk pace , but it does slow down to a trot toward the end . Lucille Ball does well in a dramatic role ( delivered with some typical light touches ) and all in all it manages to entertain despite some flaws . Douglas Sirk , noted more for his Technicolored melodramas in the ' 50s , does a nice job of direction .
447508	1048771	64638	6.0	Chandler's Marlowe transferred to the ' 60s . . .	Shifting Chandler's private eye to the ' 60s seems to work fairly well , although I still miss the film noir look of the gritty ' 40s melodramas with either Humphrey Bogart or George Montgomery as Marlowe . In addition , filming this one in color to take advantage of some Los Angeles locations , was not necessarily the best idea . JAMES GARNER works well as Marlowe , although I still prefer the dry delivery of Humphrey Bogart and his one-liners in THE BIG SLEEP . But Garner is at his physical peak and makes a persuasive private detective on the trail of someone's missing brother . Along the way , he gets involved with the usual assortment of disreputable characters who occupy seedy hotel rooms and the shady side of town . With a supporting cast that includes CARROLL O'CONNOR , JACKIE COOGAN and RITA MORENO ( as a stripper ) , it's a stylish updating of Chandler's novel , " The Little Sister " . And let's not forget BRUCE LEE who does a Karate job on Garner's office wall and furniture . Too many of the early scenes drag and it's an hour into the story before the plot gets any livelier . In short , the plot remains rather flat and devoid of any real urgent suspense in spite of the fact that it deals with ice pick murders . Summing up : Despite the okay performance from Garner , it remains a flabby exercise in suspense , lacking the terse quality of Chandler's stories and doesn't really perk up until the last ten minutes .
446963	1048771	47580	6.0	Pleasant locales but it's still little more than a travelogue . . .	Time hasn't been kind to certain films and THREE COINS IN THE FOUNTAIN is one of them . The story at its center is trite and only exists in order to show the splendors of Rome in color and CinemaScope to lure patrons away from their television sets when the film was made , in the mid-'50s . The only performers emerging from the film unscathed are JEAN PETERS , gorgeous as a secretary looking for romance away from the office , and the two men who are in their physical prime and give the film's most ingratiating performances - - ROSSANO BRAZZI and LOUIS JOURDAN , both being the prototypes of the sort of European men American women find so attractive . DOROTHY McGUIRE is saddled with the role of a spinster ( of 38 ) whose object of affection is CLIFTON WEBB ( mid-'60s ) who seems an odd choice for any woman and tries hard to be his usual urbane self . Nor is MAGGIE MacNAMARA any help as a conniving American girl who diligently learns the likes and dislikes of the man ( Jourdan ) she plans to trap into marriage . Miss MacNamara too often seems more annoying than charming . But it's harmless fluff , nicely staged in real Italian locales so that there's something to look at when things get dull - - as they often do . Surprisingly , the film - - which gets off to a nice start with a rendition of the title song by Frank Sinatra - - was nominated for a Best Picture Oscar . Summing up : No surprises here , just a dull story that gets an occasional lift from the romance between Peters and Brazzi which is the best , but briefest , part of the whole film . As a story , it's all too familiar by now but Jean Negulesco manages to combine story and scenery with a fluid touch , disguising the fact that it's little more than a pleasant travelogue .
446593	1048771	35552	6.0	One of the more amusing entries in the series . . .	Although the slapstick is pretty heavy at times , especially toward the wild climactic scene that winds up the whole story , WHISTLING IN DIXIE has all the ingredients that made the Bob Hope films successful in the ' 40s , with Hope as the cowardly male lead being intimidated by gangster-type bullies . Here it's RED SKELTON who seems to have inherited Hope's gag writers , because all of the jokes could just as well have been hand-me-downs from Hope during his heyday . Skelton plays " The Fox " , a radio sleuth who solves impossible crimes , and is lured to Georgia by his girlfriend when one of her friends is in a dire situation requiring the kind of help " The Fox " can offer . Lots of fun ensues when Skelton arrives at a spooky Georgian mansion , and some of the sight gags involving RAGS RAGLAND ( in a twin role - - one good , one bad ) , are quite funny although they tend to be overdone by the time the last reel is reached . ANN RUTHERFORD has a flair for light comedy that makes her a good mate for Skelton and the rest of the cast goes along with the gags and pratfalls in a professional manner . DIANA LEWIS lays on the Southern accent a little too thick , but this is probably for comedy effect . GEORGE BANCROFT , GUY KIBBEE and PETER WHITNEY have fun with good supporting roles . Summing up : Good fun , if you like these sort of slapstick murder mysteries .
445733	1048771	74806	6.0	Disturbing , with some dark themes and subtlety in the playing . . .	There's not too much to recommend here , except that JODIE FOSTER was always an interesting actress , even as a young girl , but the story could have been much more gripping and taut with suspense . She never seemed to play the wholesome types , and this is no exception . She's a bright thirteen year-old , living ostensibly with her poet father in a seaside house , very adult in her manners and interests . She doesn't like the snooping of others who ask too many questions about her quiet life in a house where her father is never seen . ALEXIS SMITH ( her landlady ) and MARTIN SHEEN ( her lecherous son ) are among those who do ask too many questions and threaten her isolated and very private existence . Like Miss Foster , their performances are just fine . All of this keeps the audience interested in finding out what has happened to her father - - and what are the dark secrets she is hiding . There are a few unexpected plot twists , but most of the story is told in a very understated way in a style that is not likely to connect with today's audiences who want films with a faster pace . However , there is a certain subtlety to the proceedings and it does get under your skin if you let yourself fall under the spell of some very good acting . It seems like ideal material for Alfred Hitchcock , who , in this very same year , came up with his poorly received FAMILY PLOT . By comparison , this one rates more attention .
448078	1048771	362269	6.0	Puritan America's sexual awakening through Kinsey . . .	It never occurred to me that watching a film about Dr . Kinsey would be like watching a dry documentary about a fascinating subject . That's the impression one can get from the opening scenes - - but fortunately , the film improves as it goes on . The film is structured as a series of vignettes based on the sort of questions that were posed in the Kinsey Report which was widely read and published in the ' 50s - - and to some degree it works . We see how Kinsey himself came to regard sex and the study of it . JOHN LITHGOW is his puritan , uptight father ( " The decline of the Roman Empire was due to too frequent use of bathing " ) , revealed through questions posed by CHRIS O'DONNELL and TIMOTHY HUTTON as Kinsey workers being trained to ask the probing questions . LIAM NEESON has the title role as the professor with the bold teaching methods unafraid to talk about sex . LAURA LINNEY is the forthright student who encounters Kinsey at college and forms a relationship with him . She's a brilliant scholar , a free thinker with a profound love of nature . Unfortunately , watching some of the scenes unfold are like watching paint dry despite sincere performances by Neeson and Linney who hold the story together . The first awkward sexual experience between Neeson and Linney in marriage is almost painfully awkward and unsettling to watch . We realize while watching the early portions of the film that we were really in the dark about sexuality until Kinsey boldly brought forth talk about masturbation , homosexuality , oral sex , etc . , which all were taboo subjects that kept everyone in the dark until his study was released . Despite all the graphic sex talk , the film itself manages to be rather more dry than might be expected - - and preachy , at that , when dealing with the regulations that governed sexual conduct in the 1950s and long before we treated sex as candidly as we do today in the media . But it has to be commended for making a strong point about raising a significant question : What is normal ? Until " The Kinsey Report " came out , nobody had the foggiest idea , so enormous was his contribution . Everybody read the report to find out if they were normal ! We've come a long way since then . There's a lot to be said for the kind of enlightenment that came with " the report " that took most Americans out of the dark ages . But oddly enough , with all the sex talk , the film is largely non-stimulating . Too bad there weren't more scenes like the one between JOHN LITHGOW and LIAM NEESON when Neeson convinces his father to be a subject for his report . OLIVIER PLATT gives a good performance as a fellow scientist and all of the supporting roles are well played by a fine cast . Nice work by LYNN REDGRAVE as a woman who , thanks to Kinsey , realizes she's not the only woman in the world to experience Lesbian tendencies and find fulfillment with a woman . And PETER SARSGAARD is wonderful as the bisexual who shares a torrid kissing scene with Neeson . Summing up : Uneven film has many moments of truth leading up to publication of " Sexual Behavior in the Human Male " - - and later , an equally well read study of the female - - which became huge best-sellers and delivered a lot of folks from a life of ignorance about a topic dearest to their hearts .
445300	1048771	456380	6.0	Enjoyable and informative intro to " Dodge City " and the ' 39 publicity junket . . .	I've really enjoyed these DVD introductions , especially the wise comments by Bob Thomas , Robert Osborne , Rudy Behlmer and historian Lincoln D . Hurst which really give credit where it's due and make the viewer understand the reputation of films like DODGE CITY in the context of when it was made , in 1939 . At the time , there was no television and studios sent their biggest stars out on publicity junkets . For DODGE CITY , the whole town turned out to welcome the Warner stock company celebrities that included Flynn , Bruce Cabot , John Garfield , Humphrey Bogart , Priscilla Lane , Rosemary Lane , Frank McHugh , Ann Sheridan and many others . But the commentary by Thomas , Osborne and Hurst is what comprises most of this special nine minute feature . They talk about Flynn's acceptance as a western star and his reluctance at first to attempt the role ; about the contribution made by Technicolor and Olivia de Havilland as Flynn's popular leading lady ; about Ann Sheridan's small but colorful role as a saloon singer ; and discuss " heavies " Bruce Cabot and Victor Jory who were the hissable villains of the piece . It serves as an enjoyable intro to the film , which turned out to be a huge success for Warner Bros . at a time when very few major films were photographed in three-strip Technicolor .
446270	1048771	404054	6.0	Sinatra does his thing in a one man show . . .	There's a very ' 65 look to this TV special with FRANK SINATRA belting out his songs on some very simple sets , backed by the graceful orchestral arrangements of Nelson Riddle and Gordon Jenkins . He's totally at ease but his quips could have been better scripted . Howevever , he does justice to a dozen songs and never loses his poise or his cool . The numbers are : Without A Song , I Get A Kick Out of You , Nancy with the Laughing Face , My Kind of Town , It Was A Very Good Year , Young at Heart , The Girl Next Door , Beautiful Girl , Come Fly With Me , I've Got the World on a String , Witchcraft , You Make Me Feel So Young and Put Your Dreams Away . Should please all Sinatra fans .
448084	1048771	71598	6.0	Harry and his Tonto . . . another buddy flick but with a difference . . .	ART CARNEY and his orange tabby take a cross-country odyssey when he loses his lodgings in a rundown NYC building being converted to a garage . He leaves his friendly , somewhat eccentric friends in his neighborhood , makes a brief stab at living with impossible relatives and then heads for the open road again . He's independent in every way except one - - he won't live without his cat Tonto either at his side or in tow . The situations are a little extreme . He disembarks from his bus ride so that the cat can relieve itself and then can't find Tonto when the cat runs off . He does find his cat and they continue their journey , meeting up with a few other kookie characters on the way . 56 year-old Carney , in age make-up , does a remarkable job of holding audience interest while he spends much of the time addressing his remarks to Tonto . Geraldine Fitzgerald has a nice bit as an old flame , now in an old age home . Nothing deep here . His most philospophical comment is : " Did you know that the strangest thing about being old is , all your friends are dead . " There's also a priceless moment when his nephew , Norman , who never says much , responds to ELLYN BURSTYN , " I love you too , Aunt Shirley , but you're a such a bitch . " Some editing would have trimmed the last half of the movie to a more suitable length . Two hours is a bit much for this kind of slight tale . Considering some of the great male performances that were up for Oscars that year , Carney's win is surprising . It's a rather one-note , one dimensional role - - although he makes the most of it . Good , but too many rough edges - - not quite as heart-warming as I expected it to be .
445688	1048771	16884	6.0	Sizzling chemistry heats up the screen . . . but it's old-fashioned melodrama . . .	GRETA GARBO was never a favorite of mine , so I'm not going to give the silent FLESH AND THE DEVIL a gushing review - - the sort you expect to have from a Garbo fanatic . In looking at it objectively , I find it a beautifully photographed romantic melodrama , titillating because of the subtext of homo-erotic friendship between JOHN GILBERT and LARS HANSON that threatens to become more than a subtext before the end . And Garbo's demise leaves them free to pursue their lifelong friendship . The story is simplicity itself . Two men love the same woman - - where have you heard that one before ? The difference is in the telling . Garbo is photographed to great advantage - - and so is Gilbert for that matter - - especially during their intense love scenes . When he so nobly asks his friend to look after her while he's forced to go to South Africa for several years , what happens ? They fall in love - - so that when he returns two years earlier than expected , he finds out they have married . That's the nub of the story . Under Clarence Brown's direction it moves at a leisurely pace , alternately moody and romantic , but not without some flourishes of humor to brighten things once in awhile . Summing up : Worthwhile if you're a Garbo fan - - otherwise , you might find it too melodramatic and cornball for your taste . The TCM print is in mint condition most of the way and the background score by Carl Davis is appropriate without being jarring .
446113	1048771	64310	6.0	Stylish thriller seems more like a made-for-TV movie . . .	Joseph Stefano ( who wrote the script for PSYCHO ) , is responsible for this script which is fine until about mid-point when the story starts to fall apart . He drops the theme of terrifying cats for awhile and then has them emerge once more just for the rather hokey climax . But it's stylishly done . You can feel Brian dePalma's influence on director David Lowell Rich right from the opening montage of cat stalkers against colorful backgrounds . There's a stately elegance to the home of the rich wheelchair bound widow ( ELEANOR PARKER ) , a home where she is presumably being protected by numerous felines roaming around freely . She needs protecting . Seems her hairdresser ( GAYLE HUNNICUTT ) is scheming with Parker's nephew to kill the woman and get a hold of her inheritance which she threatens to leave to the cats unless she is able to locate her missing nephew . It's a good little thriller with some edge of the chair moments that grip the audience , but none of it seems too plausible with stilted dialog and overly melodramatic moments that seem terribly contrived . For suspense and the compensation of watching Eleanor Parker in one of her latter day roles , it's probably worth viewing . Just don't expect anything on the level of PSYCHO .
447925	1048771	20695	6.0	Basil Rathbone in an early detective role . . .	When you consider that sound had only come in a couple of years before THE BISHOP MURDER CASE , the fact that the film still has a soundtrack that needs restoration is no surprise . But I did manage to see a good print of the film on TCM and the gleaming B & W photography belied the fact that this was made in 1930 . But my sole purpose for watching was to see what BASIL RATHBONE looked like in an early detective role as Philo Vance . The mystery itself seemed a lot like an Agatha Christie whodunit because the murders were staged by a clever killer who just wasn't smart enough to outwit Philo Vance . The final revelation involves a glass of wine with poison in it ( " the vessel with the pessel " film that Rathbone did with Danny Kaye comes to mind here ) . Rathbone's cleverness and manner of solving the crime is reminiscent of the way he played Sherlock Holmes so well in all those Sherlock films . He also had a crisp delivery that was lacking in the other players . Only ROLAND YOUNG managed to sound as if silent films were a thing of the past . The others were clearly still in the silent mode of acting which makes Rathbone's performance even more remarkable . Not a great mystery by any means and the sets , despite some fine photography , are on the primitive side - - but addicts of detective stories should enjoy this one .
445570	1048771	51337	6.0	Sinbad and the cyclops , the two-headed bird and the skeleton . . .	Delightful escapist fare for children , but adults will notice how primitive the stop-motion photography is by today's standards of computer imagery . This is the typical fantasy adventure fare offered in the ' 50s for lovers of tales of the Arabian Nights . The bland but handsome KERWIN MATHEWS is Sinbad , who single-handedly fights a crew of mutinous sailors in Douglas Fairbanks fashion , and making it look as though it's a piece of cake . The writers have thrown a few obstacles in his course . He must capture the egg of a giant two-headed bird of prey to restore a miniaturized princess ( KATHRYN GRANT ) , fight a giant one-eyed Cyclops , and engage a skeleton in a duel to the death before he can sail off into the sunset with the princess he loves . The villain of this piece is TORIN THATCHER , but he's no Conrad Veidt . He manages to be sinister but not in the same league with what Veidt could do with a mere glance . The fascinating stop-motion wizardry of Ray Harryhausen is still fun to watch - - the same sort of gimmick used for the original KING KONG ( ' 33 ) . The animation is quite good but pales , of course , by comparison to today's CGI effects . Above average Technicolor is a big help . Summing up : Grand adventure for the kids on a big budget scale , but the stilted acting of Matthews and others leaves a lot to be desired .
446850	1048771	20572	6.0	Transitional silent / sound Lloyd film is semi-successful overlong comedy . . .	Sound technology was new in 1929 - - brand new - - and WELCOME DANGER , originally filmed in silent mode , was re-filmed with sound , the crude sound of the ' 20s which alternates between being loud one moment and soft the next , forcing a constant hand on the volume if you wish to keep track of the painfully banal dialog . HAROLD LLOYD , improbably cast as the son of a police chief who ruled Chinatown , is sent to San Francisco to wipe out crime among the drug lords . Lloyd is a botany student who isn't quite what the force was expecting . The opening scenes with BARBARA KENT are delightfully played for comic situations , but again it's the script that's the real problem . She seems a natural enough actress and Lloyd delivers his lines in OK style , but it's slow going to watch each scene develop - - and most of the comic situations are pretty lame . EDGAR KENNEDY has fun with his role as a desk sergeant who sends Lloyd off on what he thinks is a wild goose chase in Chinatown looking for The Dragon . Some of the sight gags are still fun , left-overs from the silent version , but the film has to be considered an uneasy transition between silent and sound that never quite clicks the way Lloyd's silent comedies did . As Osborne said when doing the intro , some of it is " pretty rough " . Summing up : Except for the interesting Chinatown sequence ( which goes on much too long ) , and the slight twist as to the identity of The Dragon , this one is strictly for Harold Lloyd fans who want to see his complete works .
445719	1048771	44419	6.0	Kirk Douglas leads dangerous expedition in Indian territory . . .	If ever a sprawling tale about an expedition up the Missouri river to trade furs begged for Technicolor photography , THE BIG SKY is it . Based on the novel by A . B . Guthrie , it has KIRK DOUGLAS in the lead as the head of the expedition but most of the footage belongs to young DEWEY MARTIN in his first big screen role . Why he never managed to become a more important player in Hollywood remains a mystery to me . Unfortunately , Dudley Nichols ' screenplay is rather episodic and there are many points toward the end of the film where it seems the story is about to end and then there are further scenes . I found none of the narration objectionable ( as others here seem to imply ) , but the structure of the screenplay is awkwardly handled , especially toward the latter part of the film . Another minus point , the night scenes in the woods look as though they were photographed in a studio and not on location which minimizes the sense of danger from Indians and other trappers that the story requires . But most of the exterior daylight scenes are photographed in crisp B & W photography in real outdoor settings which tend to jar against the studio-lit scenes , making them more noticeable . There's plenty of male camaraderie and friendship among the trappers and colorful incidents involving the Indians , so if this kind of western is your thing you'll undoubtedly find it interesting . I watched the 140 minute version on TCM and it was slow going at times . Summing up : Biggest drawback : should definitely have been filmed in breathtaking Technicolor .
447112	1048771	82085	6.0	Another DePalma thriller that owes a lot to Hitchcock . . .	BLOW OUT deserves more attention than a lot of other thrillers from the ' 80s , partly because it's taut with suspense most of the time and owes a lot of its chill to JOHN LITHGOW's performance as a cold-blooded psychotic killer . It's also one of JOHN TRAVOLTA's best early roles as a soundman looking for " the perfect scream " for one of his horror movies who accidentally shoots some film of a car careening off a bridge . He dives into the water to try saving the victims but is only able to rescue the woman ( NANCY ALLEN ) . It turns out that the driver was a senator who was a presidential candidate ( shades of Chappaquiddick ) . From then on , the mystery deepens as he comes to suspect there's some kind of conspiracy involved . DENNIS FRANZ is Allen's boss , a sleazy photographer , who offers to help Travolta . The whole story is filmed with all the DePalma camera tricks and touches that keep the suspense boiling until the climactic shoot-out at the climax . But it's JOHN LITHGOW who steals the film as the merciless killer with undisclosed political reasons for his murderous mission . A forgotten gem among the stylish DePalma films that deserves more recognition today . I'm not much of a Travolta fan , but this is one of his better roles .
445651	1048771	114194	6.0	Christopher Walken steals interesting horror fantasy . . .	CHRISTOPHER WALKEN makes the most of his meaty role at the center of THE PROPHECY , an offbeat horror fantasy about good and bad angels and a war in heaven that involves Walken's desperate search for a dark soul on earth . VIRGINIA MADSEN is effective as a schoolteacher protecting a girl who inadvertently has the dark soul implanted in her by a stranger she trusts . ELIAS KOTEAS is the intense young man who abandoned his plans for the priesthood and has become a detective on the hunt for a killer of souls . VIGGO MORTENSEN does a sinister job as Lucifer , whispering his lines with a rasping intensity and making a vivid impression in a brief role . Like THE DA VINCI CODE , it takes religious elements and weaves them into a story of good vs . evil using angels in a way that is seldom ever done and making an intriguing tale of suspense based on the darkness of the human soul . CHRISTOPHER WALKEN has a great time as the Archangel Gabriel , ruling over everyone with a number of nasty lines and knowing winks , with overtones of humor throughout his devilish performance . Strictly for horror fans who want their imagination to turn on a different sort of fantasy with religious motifs - - the sort of horror film that some will find offensive and other will enjoy tremendously . Summing up : Good , intense performances from the entire cast .
445812	1048771	110367	6.0	Satisfactory version is better than the dated ' 33 classic . . .	WINONA RYDER makes an impressive Jo in Louisa May Alcott's LITTLE WOMEN , tomboyishly charming and persuasive as she matures into a fine young writer . She won a Best Actress nomination , but strangely , her career never took off as strongly as it should have after this success . Except for GIRL INTERRUPTED , she hasn't had a recent string of hits nor has she been as busy at her craft as one would expect . A good Jo is essential for the story to work , and since everyone else is well cast this is no problem . SUSAN SARANDON does a nice job as Marmee and the priceless MARY WICKES ( in one of her last roles ) is a formidable Aunt March . Christian BALE ( who went on to much better roles in the future ) makes a completely acceptable Laurie , and the sisters are well played by KIERSTEN DUNST ( especially good as the young Amy ) , CLAIRE DANES , SAMANTHA MATHIS and TRINI ALVARADO . Filmed in Canada , there's a genuinely wintry look to the New England landscapes and a warm glow to the interior scenes that is perfectly in keeping with the story . In fact , all of the technical elements are in fine order . But somehow , it never quite reaches the grandeur of Alcott's beautifully written tale and , for a film based on a classic novel , doesn't linger in the memory as it should when the distance of a few years have passed . It should have been a minor masterpiece , but misses the mark , although it's considerably more worthwhile watching than the sweet George Cukor version with Katharine Hepburn which now seems awfully dated in style and conception . There are some modern sensibilities written into this LITTLE WOMEN ( thanks to Susan Sarandon's observations as the mother ) and , in general , it plays more believably than the ' 33 classic .
447547	1048771	143755	6.0	A nostalgic look at a small American turn in the early 1900s . . .	Nostalgic but not exactly stimulating is my brief description of this rather quiet little short subject narrated by John Nesbitt , a tribute to his old hometown . Images of spring , firecrackers on the 4th of July , farmers ploughing the land , a boy fishing and swimming with pals , school days , high school graduation exercises , and young men pursuing more adult pleasures such as the poolroom , dances , summer concerts , etc . The narration concludes with the statement that " No path leads to yesterday , " and the glimpse of small town life is over as the scene shifts to the present day 1948 . Anyone who has grown up on MGM films can spot scenes from " Our Vines Have Tender Grapes " used as stock footage with " Butch " Jenkins as the boy doing the fishing and seen in a couple of other farm images .
446638	1048771	24601	6.0	Amusing comedy gets better after a slow start . . .	LAUREL & HARDY are next door neighbors ( married to DOROTHY CHRISTY and MAE BUSCH , respectively ) , both strong-minded women who remind me of the " Alice Kramden " character on " The Honeymooners " . Neither one wants their hubby to go to a Chicago convention of The Sons of the Desert , so the boys have to fake an excuse in order to bamboozle their wives into thinking Oliver is following his doctor's orders to get a restful vacation in Honolulu . At the convention , it's a hoot to see dancing girls in Hawaian costumes ( beefy and overweight by today's anorexic standards ) while a slim male singer / dancer renders " Honolulu Baby " in a tenor voice . CHARLEY CHASE has a field day playing practical jokes on the boys , but it's the return home part of the story that really is the set-up for the best gags . In fact , it's the last twenty-five minutes that puts the film over the top as one of the best Laurel & Hardy features . Written by Frank Craven ( the film actor , who also contributed to several screenplays ) and directed by George A . Seiter , it's obviously the forerunner of many situation comedies about quarreling husbands and wives trying to outsmart each other . Stan is surprisingly funny when given a long , wordy sentence to say , and Oliver's facial reactions ( especially when he fixes his gaze on the camera as if to say , ' Can you believe this ? ' ) , are priceless . Lots of fun for fans of the comedians .
446989	1048771	51756	6.0	Tom Tryon and Gloria Henry in good sci-fi B-film from the ' 50s . . .	The surprise of this little sci-fi epic is GLORIA HENRY , who manages to convey all the right expressions as the wife who comes to realize that her husband is no longer the man she married . TOM TRYON is the man who early on is attacked by an alien who takes over his body . From then on , Tryon's robot-like acting fits the demands of his role beautifully , since he only has one expression on his impossibly handsome face at all times . Talk about one-dimensional ! He looks like a department store mannequin come to life - - almost . It's a good thing he had a career as a Gothic writer ahead of him . However , it's the tight script , the crisp B & W photography , the jagged bits of music , and the eerie plot that bears more than a slight resemblance to " Invasion of the Body Snatchers " that is guaranteed to keep you awake - - even though it is obviously a B-film with no big pretensions to be anything else . Possible SPOILER AheadIt's another one of those tales where the poor wife dares not trust any of the citizens of a small town - - since any one of them might have turned into an alien , like her hubby . The plot builds to a nice climactic shootout and her husband is returned to her . We know he's assumed his own body again because he actually breaks into a grin before the fadeout . Summing up : Brisk , entertaining little sci-fi tale , the kind that was popular with audiences in the ' 50s .
445305	1048771	56112	6.0	Kerwin Matthews to the rescue of a bewitched princess . . .	Produced on a modest budget but filmed in color with some primitive looking special effects , JACK THE GIANT KILLER will probably be just the right sort of entertainment for its target audience - - kids . Stalwart KERWIN MATTHEWS , who seemed to be specializing in these kind of swordplay roles for awhile in the ' 60s , makes a good adventure hero and JUDI MEREDITH is a satisfactory princess who has to be rescued once she falls under the spell of the wicked TORIN THATCHER . Thatcher is the wizard / magician , power mad and obsessed with dethroning a king whose throne he covets . A good make-up job emphasizes his villainy , an attempt to convert him into a man resembling the Conrad Veidt character in THE THIEF OF BAGDAD . Despite the terrific make-up , Thatcher is never quite as chilling a villain as Veidt . ANNA LEE has a small role as a woman who falls under his evil spell and TUDOR OWEN is another familiar face in the supporting cast . Matthews has to fight one stop animation figure after another , all in good fun and perfect entertainment for the kids . Summing up : Not bad for the kiddies and adults will appreciate seeing the late Kerwin Matthews in the sort of action role he was known for .
448035	1048771	43961	7.0	Not the director's cut - - but still a powerful film with fine performances . . .	The original cut of THE RED BADGE OF COURAGE has never been seen - - and probably does not exist - - but this is the truncated version of the John Huston film and it's still powerful stuff . It's an examination of courage among men under intense fire - - such as the infantry men in the Civil War , about whom writer Stephen Crane wrote with almost poetical finesse . So that some of Crane's writing is maintained on screen , we get a narration by James Whitmore that succeeds in helping us understand the central character ( AUDIE MURPHY ) and his motivations . Judging from photographs of the Civil War , the film has a gritty , realistic look as it goes from battle to battle with a group of men we get to know and recognize as vulnerable human beings caught in the tragedy of impossible battle situations . AUDIE MURPHY is not noted for being an actor capable of deep characterization , but he's been guided by Huston to give a very effective , deeply felt performance , no doubt helped by the fact that he's been in the midst of battle before ( he's a real life war hero ) , and must know the inner conflicts that face any man in battle . The supporting cast of actors are fine , especially BILL MAULDIN as Audie's friend , both of them confessing moments of cowardice during battle fatigue and then able to go on with their mission . But the real credit has to go to John Huston for writing and directing a film that he was never especially proud of , but which is stunningly photographed and directed with great skill .
445351	1048771	60934	7.0	Steve McQueen remains the focal point in ambitious , sometimes rambling film . . .	STEVE McQUEEN makes a completely believable machinist's mate aboard a U . S . Navy gunboat who finds himself enmeshed in the politics of unrest that existed in 1926 China during the period of the Boxer Rebellion . It's probably one of the finest roles of his career - - honest , vexating , and completely true to the emotions of his character whose only real concern is taking care of his engines . There are plenty of other good performances . RICHARD CRENNA is the Captain , uncertain of just how the U . S . / Chinese friction should be solved , and CANDACE BERGEN is lovely as a missionary who has a tender romance with McQueen . The exotic locales ( it was filmed mostly in Taiwan ) , the lush background score by Jerry Goldsmith , and the confrontation between the U . S . Navy and the Chinese authorities which supplies the necessary suspense before an action-filled climax , all serve to make THE SAND PEBBLES a fascinating look at a period in history that is seldom explored . And , of course , it raises questions as to our role in imperialism and our interaction with the culture of foreign countries that make the film relevant today . It's a long film , rather uneven in places , but directed with rare sensitivity by Robert Wise and richly detailed period atmosphere .
445565	1048771	105236	7.0	Graphic crime film from Tarantino . . .	It took me fifteen years to get around to viewing RESERVOIR DOGS and my interest was piqued only because I've come to admire HARVEY KEITEL as an actor . And I might as well admit , I'm not a fan of Quentin Tarantino either , although I love a good crime film . This one has to do with tough gang members talking about the aftermath of a crime , where one of them is seriously wounded and they suspect someone has infiltrated their mob and tipped off the police . " Did you kill anybody ? " " Three cops . No real people , just cops . " The brutal torture scene was a little too intense for me . But the story , about the cop inserting himself into the mob , is well handled throughout , building tension from scene to scene even though the flashbacks are not in chronological order . Standout performances from the entire cast : HARVEY KEITEL , TIM ROTH , MICHAEL MADSEN , CHRIS PENN , QUENTIN Tarantino and LAWRENCE TIERNEY ( almost unrecognizable as the Lawerence Tierney of " Dillinger " and other ' 40s crime films ) . Warning : As usual with Tarantino , the graphic violence is a bit much with lots of kicking , stabbing , blood gushing moments - - and the torture scene of a young cop is almost unwatchable in its intensity and cruelty . But all in all , a powerful film of its kind with a " crime doesn't pay " morality tacked onto the brutal ending . If only Tarantino could tell his tales with a little more finesse - - but then , he wouldn't be Tarantino , would he ? Warning : Not for children . Too intense , too graphic . Seen now , it's almost a forerunner of Martin Scorsese's THE DEPARTED with the same gangster brutality and the dialog peppered with profanity in practically every other word .
445966	1048771	18051	7.0	The best of the Harold Lloyd comedies . . . simply wonderful . . .	I kept thinking how he deserves recognition as one of the great silent comedians alongside Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin - - especially with his wonderful work in the well-crafted THE KID BROTHER . The simple plot has him as the youngest and rather nerdy kid brother with his two strapping brothers towering over him as the apple of their father's eyes . Whenver something has to be done , he's left out of the picture while his father assigns his brothers to the task . But the funniest scenes have to do with him trying to outwit and pull fast tricks on his brothers in a series of sight gags . They're perfectly willing to bully him whenever a show of muscle is involved - - particularly when impressing a girl they all have a yen for . There are too many sight gags to enumerate here and they all involve physical dexterity and timing of the highest order . A particularly demanding set of stunts are performed in the latter half of the story when our hero must board a ghost ship to retrieve money his father has been accused of stealing . The scenes involve a monkey in a sailor suit and a vicious villain out for the kill in keeping hold on stolen money . All of it is photographed with great style and there's an emotional attachment to the romantic angle involving the girl ( JOBYNA RALSTON ) so that the hectic comedy is anchored by a story that keeps the comedy on firm ground . Summing up : A delightful physical comedy , wonderfully photographed and played by an excellent cast , with Lloyd at his all-time best . In my opinion , this one tops SAFETY FIRST .
447569	1048771	39881	7.0	Tense crime thriller in gritty noir style . . .	Some nice shadowy photography by John Alton and a well-paced storyline directed with style by Anthony Mann , makes for a diverting crime melodrama in crisp documentary style that was popular in the early to mid-'40s . Think BOOMERANG , THE HOUSE ON 92nd STREET , 13 ROUE MADELEINE and other Fox melodramas of that era . But this was done on a poverty row budget by Eagle-Lion with the usually light-weight actor DENNIS O'KEEFE in the sort of role usually handed to someone like Dana Andrews , Mark Stevens , John Hodiak or William Eythe if the film was made at Fox . He's surprisingly good as a noir hero whose task is to infiltrate a counterfeit gang with another Federal man , posing as would-be counterfeiters , and thus providing a succession of suspenseful moments where our hero is in danger of being exposed as a T-man for the government . Even more effective , in lesser roles , are CHARLES McGRAW and WALLACE FORD . In fact , McGraw would have been an even better choice for the lead than O'Keefe , his tight-lipped bearing and impressive physique suiting him for the role of a dangerous noir hero . June Lockhart has only a fleeting appearance in one brief scene but others in the cast are properly sinister or authoritative , according to the way the script depicts the supporting characters . Summing up : Worth a look , but not at the top of the film noir greats due to a script that is only slightly above average .
446651	1048771	43137	7.0	James Stewart finds his niche in sturdy western role . . .	This complicated western was a milestone in the career of JAMES STEWART after his return from war service , wanting to change his image by doing a western , which is largely regarded as the reason for the influx of westerns in the ' 50s since it's very impressive . Too bad it wasn't photographed in Technicolor . Stewart wins first prize for " the gun that won the West " , but then has to spend the rest of the film trying to recover it when it's stolen . SHELLEY WINTERS is a shady gal with an unsavory reputation and STEPHEN McNALLY is the local bad boy gunman in Dodge City . WILL GEER is Wyatt Earp and DAN DURYEA is Shelley's bad boyfriend . And wouldn't you know that , it being a Universal-International film , TONY CURTIS and ROCK HUDSON ( both quite unknown at the time ) have bit roles . An interesting sequence features the first Indian attack , whereby CHARLES DRAKE reveals himself to be a coward who rides off , leaving Shelley alone in the horse-drawn wagon . He later redeems himself , but it's just one of the twists and turns that has the gun passing from one unsavory hand to another - - but finally ending up with the rightful owner . STEPHEN McNALLY and JAMES STEWART have quite a final shootout that is almost as melodramatic ( but not quite ) as DUEL IN THE SUN's blazing guns finale . McNally makes the perfect villain and DAN DURYEA is equally treacherous in the kind of villainous role he played throughout the ' 40s as a low-life gunslinger . Tightly constructed story is extremely well directed by Anthony Mann , and it's fun to see ROCK HUDSON ( credited as Young Bull ) wearing Indian war paint and TONY CURTIS as a young soldier who casts longing glances at the then slim and attractive Shelley Winters . Well worth viewing and definitely an above average story .
448079	1048771	65988	7.0	Dustin Hoffman in seriocomic western on events surrounding Custer . . .	Highly entertaining saga has Dustin Hoffman as the lone elderly survivor of the attack at Little Big Horn , recounting his life history to a skeptical historian - - and it's quite a story , beginning with the massacre of his family in an Indian attack as a ten year-old boy and his growing up among the Cheyennes who adopt him and call him " Little Big Man " when he proves he's a worthy " human being " among them . The handsomely produced tale , filmed in gorgeous color on what appear to be actual locales , follows him throughout episodes always spiced by wicked humor . Especially funny is the sequence where he's delivered to the doorstep of a minister and his wife ( FAYE DUNAWAY ) , a woman who quotes the Bible but has more earthy matters on her mind when she sets eyes on Dustin and assumes the duty of bathing him while promising to avert her eyes at the proper moment . The humor is beneath even the most serious scenes , so that we know the tall tale is being offered as a tongue-in-cheek treatment of Indian / white relationships , as well as a re-evaluation by Hoffman of what General George Armstrong Custer was really like . Custer is shown as a vainglorious type of man who dislikes having his decisions reversed , as what happens when he decides to spare the life of Hoffman at their first meeting - - and later , lives to regret it . Although the running time is well over two hours , the story never lacks interest , with nice use being made of the " Garry Owen " tune that Custer loved . It's used most effectively in the final battle sequence at Little Big Horn which is really something to see . No expense has been spared to give the film realistic looking settings and a fine cast of players . JEFF COREY is amusing as Wild Bill Hickcock , looking very much like Victor Jory behind his beard and mustache and RICHARD MULLIGAN makes a believable Custer . CHIEF DAN GEORGE is excellent as a wise old Indian who turns out to be something of a prophet with his eerie dreams , and KELLY JEAN PETERS is a spirited Olga , Dustin's first wife . Summing up : Highly entertaining treatment and a different , less Hollywood view of the American Indian with a brilliant performance by Dustin Hoffman - - and the age make-up is terrific .
445610	1048771	67185	7.0	Eccentric comedy still has fresh appeal . . .	For sheer audacity , you have to congratulate the makers of HAROLD AND MAUDE for taking such a chance on this black comedy material and making it work , largely due to the title roles played so perfectly by RUTH GORDON and BUD CORT . The highly improbable story is entertaining enough to let anyone dismiss the flaws of logic - - a suspension of disbelief that must be had in order to enjoy the wacky tale of how two people from opposite viewpoints ( not to mention different ends of the generation gap ) , meet and fall in love . Funniest sequences are Cort's various attempts at suicide in front of his pragmatic mother , who then decides she must match him with a suitable girl so he can get married . She fills out a questionnaire for him , reciting all the questions posed by the survey and then answering them as she herself believes , rather than waiting for Harold's answer . VIVIAN PICKLE does a rib-tickling job as the mother . RUTH GORDON and BUD CORT play their roles straight , he with an expression of angelic innocence and a rather blank stare , and she with her customary skill at portraying zaniness with an air of eccentricity that is engaging . It all moves very swiftly and tells its tale in an hour-and-a-half , well within the limits of its slight story . The Cat Stevens songs on the soundtrack add a piquancy to the tale , but the ending is just a tad bit disappointing . On a cheery note , we note that Harold has now taken up a musical instrument and intends to live a little as he walks jauntily away from the camera on a hilltop . Summing up : You won't know whether to laugh or cry in some places , but it's a rather sweet little story beautifully executed .
446194	1048771	278500	7.0	Charming comedy of manners played to the hilt by a wonderful cast . . .	I can't quibble with those who say this departs from the original material in some respects , because I never saw the original . All I know is I watched it tonight for the first time and found it completely charming , easy to watch , easy to enjoy and easy to love . RUPERT EVERETT was the standout for me , excellent flair for light tongue-in-cheek comedy and COLIN FIRTH and REESE WITHERSPOON came in second with delightful performances . In fact , I can't find any fault with any of the cast members . It was all done exactly in the manner this kind of material calls for - - and on top of that , the costumes , settings , photography , music - - everything was pitch perfect . Or it could be that I was just in the mood to enjoy some light diversion after all the barrage of news on the cable channels and needed some relief from " real life " for awhile . At any rate , enjoyed the dialog between the two women , the two brothers , and , of course , with JUDI DENCH giving an imposing performance as the starch-collared Aunt Agatha who sees everything through the prism of class distinction . Very enjoyable film - - sorry if Oscar Wilde purists couldn't get past a few subtle changes . Some very funny lines recited so earnestly with straight faces that it reminded me what a witty man Oscar Wilde must have been .
445968	1048771	40427	7.0	Richard Basehart as stone cold killer is very effective . . .	HE WALKED BY NIGHT is a neat little film noir filmed in semi-documentary style ( narration included ) , typical of several films from the ' 40s-era ( BOOMERANG , THE HOUSE ON 92ND STREET ) , taut with suspense lasting a brisk 79 minutes and released by Eagle-Lion , a small independent company . RICHARD BASEHART ( one of Hollywood's most underrated actors ) was always an interesting actor to watch and here he has one of his best roles as a petty thief and murderer who uses his skill as a radio / television technician to make a fast buck with stolen property . His scenes with WHIT BISSELL are chilling in the cold-hearted manner he deals with the man who has given him some business breaks . SCOTT BRADY , as a detective who takes it upon himself to help solve the case of the elusive killer , is excellent . JACK WEBB is featured in a small role and ROY ROBERTS is likewise effective as Capt . Breen who uses some state of the art ( at the time ) technology to put together a composite picture of what the killer might look like . The very tense build-up to the capture is film noir at its best with the camera exploring the dark underworld of sewer tunnels in San Francisco that I never knew existed . This gives the film a sort of " Third Man " look as the murky sewers become a set piece for the staging of the final shootout . Well worth watching , especially for fans of the film noir genre .
447577	1048771	408242	7.0	Well crafted documentary on a timeless Disney classic . . .	With the score of BEAUTY AND THE BEAST in the background , the documentary starts out with CELINE DION talking about the " making of a tale as old as time " and we're given bits of information about the film from the various artists and animators who worked so well on the Disney film . In other words , the segments are broken down into discussions on the characters , the art work and the technology that went into making BEAUTY AND THE BEAST with a younger team of animators who had already had great success with THE LITTLE MERMAID . Walt Disney himself had been interested in doing the story some day , from the ' 30s to the ' 50s , keeping it in mind but putting it aside while he concentrated on other projects . The challenge was to top the ' 46 French film which , although a great success , focused mainly on the two central characters and did not give animators enough to work with . So , it was decided to have the enchanted victims of the household become the Greek chorus for the story and to add a villain ( Gaston ) to thicken the plot . All of the animators were thoroughly impressed with the music and songs of Ashman and Menken which propelled the story forward and gave it " style and scope " while furthering the plot . There is much talk about how the " victims of enchantment " in the castle gave the film comic relief and added so much to the story's point of view . The success of the film was due in part to its ability to transmit the message of the transforming power of love in an affirmative way . Everyone connected with the film knew even before its release that it was destined to be a product they could be proud of . But even then , they were overwhelmed by the enormously favorable reviews . As Robert Osborne states : " It's one of the Disney films that will last forever . " He's so right . Like a true classic , this " tale as old as time " will be remembered as long as the other Disney animated features that began in the ' 30s .
446958	1048771	20686	7.0	( SPOILERS AHEAD ) . . . Powerful story is one of the screen's early " big house " prison melodramas . . .	So many high quality prison melodramas have been on the screen in the last few decades that this one - - made in 1930 - - has to be reviewed in the context of its time . As such , it's a well-written , powerful study of men behind bars , none of whom observes a code of conduct likely to make them good material for rehabilitation . CHESTER MORRIS is a forger , WALLACE BEERY is a thick-necked bullying murderer and ROBERT MONTGOMERY is a comparative " innocent " with a drunken manslaughter charge against him . They share the same cell and are soon involved in bickering and double-crosses that make up most of the plot contrivances that lead to a prison break where all hell breaks loose . Within the conventions of crime melodramas , this one maintains passable interest today although it lacks the taut tension of more modern prison dramas . Filmed when sound in film was only two years old , there is virtually no background music at all - - a factor which dates the film's style and gives it a static quality during moments where music would have raised the drama to a higher pitch . CHESTER MORRIS , an interesting actor , is likable and energetic as the man who walks out of prison a free man after helping to contain the riot . ROBERT MONTGOMERY does a fine job as the coward who breaks under the stress of having betrayed another prisoner and LEWIS STONE does a good turn as the warden . Overall , it's better than average for this sort of thing - - well paced despite the lack of background music to emphasize the drama - - and worth watching for the performances . Beery is especially good and deserved his Best Actor nomination . Chester Morris is equally impressive in the top-billed assignment , forceful and convincing all the way in a showy role . But I have to conclude that Warner Bros . seemed to have a better handle than MGM on this sort of tough , stark material . Raoul Walsh's WHITE HEAT ( ' 49 ) with James Cagney is the best example .
446876	1048771	51411	7.0	" The Big Country " is the grand-daddy of overblown westerns . . .	GREGORY PECK's innate ability to play a man of integrity is never better utilized than it is by director William Wyler for THE BIG COUNTRY . In fact , Wyler is able to draw expert performances from all of the male leads , who really do exceptional work here . It's the men who dominate the film and Wyler gives them all a chance to show what they can do . The film itself is a bit overblown , even for an epic western . As the most villainous of BURL IVES ' sons , CHUCK CONNORS stands out in a very aggressive role as the gang of four who welcome Peck to " the big country " by taunting him with reckless energy as they lasso him , tear his hat off , shoot at it , keeping his fiancé , CARROLL BAKER in check to witness their humiliating tactics . But Peck is a gentleman from the east , a Sea Captain returning to the west to marry the woman he thinks he loves and his way of dealing with bullies upsets his fiancé who fails to understand his values and always underestimates him . As it turns out , JEAN SIMMONS becomes the real woman for him - - and after many a plot turn he ends up rescuing her from a fate worse than death after she's captured by Ives and his unruly , cowardly son Connors . It's a complex story of an age old feud over water rights that involves , principally , Ives and CHARLES BICKFORD as the headstrong men who are unable to settle a score peacefully even when Peck tries to intervene . It's an epic tale , sprawling and a bit rambling over the course of two hours and forty-five minutes , but Wyler holds it all together for maximum interest , aided and abetted by a wonderful western score by Jerome Moross that has become classic . Peck never had a role that suited him so admirably and CHARLTON HESTON is excellent as Bickford's right hand man with unwanted designs on Carroll Baker . His fist fight with Peck is a classic of its kind . And ALFONSO BEDOYA ( tbe grinning bandit from TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE ) as Ramon , the sometimes dull-witted hired help with his halting English , is excellent . Summing up : A sturdy but overblown western with a classic score , full of strong performances by an expert cast .
445316	1048771	55928	7.0	The first and one of the best of the James Bond films . . .	A good story , eloquent settings , gorgeous photography , Calypso music in the background , Jamaican seaports and fancy hideaways , exotic spies and SEAM CONNERY in his first stab at the James Bond role in DR . NO . It's a good hour-and-a-half before we meet the clever Dr . No . ( JOSEPH WISEMAN ) and the palatial splendor for his guests - - Sean Connery and URSULA ANDRESS , who accompanies Bond on his island adventures . There are the usual bad guys who want to destroy a rocket launch and it's up to Bond to thwart their plans . Unlike so many other Bond adventures , DR . NO moves swiftly forward without the plot ever getting too complicated - - as it does in many a spy story by Ian Fleming and others . The simplistic approach lets the viewer enjoy the interaction between some believable characters for a change . ANTHONY DAWSON is excellent as one of Dr . No's henchmen asked to kill Bond with a tarantula . After the failed mission , Bond is able to pay Dr . No an unexpected visit . There's never any doubt that Connery and Andress will wind up together for a happy finale , but the suspense all the way through is well maintained under Terence Young's crisp direction . JACK LORD is certainly wasted in a minor role . Absolutely one of the best Bond films and a good start for the series .
447668	1048771	129672	7.0	Saw the original broadcast . . . and now it's a nostalgic view of early TV . . .	In reviewing this , I've taken into consideration that this was done live back in 1957 , when the world and I were much younger , and live television was much more primitive . Still , it's fascinating to view it again and see it from a different perspective . And yet , one can't help thinking how much technology has improved since then ! The B & W print shown on PBS tonight was a rather murky one , so I'm basing all my comments on the perception that the soundtrack was wonderful but the video left much to be desired . Of course , 21 year-old Julie Andrews ( rather matronly looking due to hairdo and make-up ) , has the right singing range to do justice to the songs and Jon Cypher keeps up with her in that department . Kaye Ballard and Alice Ghostly are fun as the two step-sisters , absurd as their characterizations are , and Ilka Chase makes an acceptable step-mother , though not quite as wicked as one could wish for . The score is full of wonderful melodies in typical R & H style , particularly the lilting waltz amid such songs as " Ten Minutes Ago " and " Do I Love You Because You're Beautiful ? " . Julie does a particularly nice rendition of " In My Own Little Corner " while Edie Adams has fun making the most of her role as the Fairy Godmother . But on the debit side is the video quality and the obviously budgeted stage sets and uninspired costuming ( especially for the ball ) . They look rather bland in B & W . Perhaps when originally telecast in color ( a factor I don't recall at this point ) , the sets and costumes had more of a glow . But as Julie Andrews says , in interviews that come on at intervals , it was a wonder the whole thing was done live in one take . This is a lot easier on the ears than the later versions and includes an amusing number between King and Queen ( preparing for the banquet ) that was cut from both of the later productions . And while the later versions had more glamor and color , this is the one to watch for complete enjoyment of the score and justice to the songs performed by Julie Andrews and the rest of the cast . What an honor for Julie Andrews - - to have a television musical written expressly for her by two of the master musicians of the 20th century , Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein . Their music has all the charm one could ask for in a production of this kind .
447752	1048771	28816	7.0	Delightful screwball comedy with Sturges at his best . . .	JEAN ARTHUR as a down on her luck secretary ( who pays $7 a week for an apartment ) is suddenly blessed with a luxurious hotel suite and a sable coat thanks to the whims of fate in this delightful ' 30s-era comedy co-starring EDWARD ARNOLD ( a bit too bombastic for my taste ) and RAY MILLAND ( charming and debonair as the romantic lead ) . Arthur has never been more personable and inhabits her role with a good deal of personal charm and warmth , perhaps attributable to director Mitchel Leisen who always seems to coax good performances from his female stars . ( Claudette Colbert in " Midnight " , Carole Lombard in " Hands Across the Table " , Olivia de Havilland in " Hold Back the Dawn " and " To Each His Own " , Barbara Stanwyck in " No Man of Her Own " . ) Arnold is a hot tempered man who throws a fur coat over the rooftop during an argument with his frivolous wife ( MARY NASH ) , a coat that lands on top of Jean Arthur , riding in a double-decker bus in New York City . The plot thickens when a hotel owner ( LUIS ALBERNI ) facing bankrupt with his fancy but vacant building , decides that Arthur will be the perfect publicity gimmick since he believes she was given the coat because of an affair with Arnold . He allows her to reside in a luxurious suite ( Leisen goes a bit overboard on set decoration here ) , and therein the fun begins . Seems he has a rich playboy son who is just as down on his luck as Arthur is and is working in an automat , the kind of fast food restaurant that existed in NYC during the ' 30s and ' 40s . In fact , the automat scene , where Milland finds a way to give Arthur a free meal , is expertly staged with every pratfall so perfectly executed that it remains the highlight of the film . But even after this highlight , the film never lets up in pace and is irresistible entertainment for fans of screwball comedy . Among the standouts in the supporting cast are FRANKLIN PANGBORN and WILLIAM DEMAREST , actors director Leisen would use to great effect in other comedies . Edward Arnold tends to overact the part of the wealthy hot-tempered tycoon , but everyone else has a fine time with the witty lines and situations . Highly recommended , brisk and very amusing , with Arthur in one of her most appealing roles .
445286	1048771	56218	7.0	Dated political thriller is still stunning to watch . . .	An eerie fact is that a film dealing with the assassination of a presidential candidate came out just shortly before the real-life assassination of President John F . Kennedy . LAURENCE HARVEY always had a rather sleep-walker kind of expression on his unlined face and here it serves him well as a man who has been hypnotized ( brainwashed is a better word ) into believing that he must kill the next presidential candidate of the U . S . because his mama wants him to . Mama is ANGELA LANSBURY , in probably the wickedest role of her long career . She soothingly explains to the transfixed Harvey exactly at what point during the ceremony he must take aim at his target - - and kill . It's the most chilling scene in the movie , except for the finale which is really spellbinding , as it takes place in a crowded Madison Square Garden with FRANK SINATRA hot on the trail of the would-be killer . Sinatra's almost immediate discovery is what throws reality off a bit at this point . He sees a pinpoint of light in the far distance and knows exactly which stairway , which exit , which floor to go to in a matter of seconds . Well , it's called taking dramatic license for the sake of art , I suppose . All in all , a very chilling reminder of the time Americans were living through in the McCarthy era , only occasionally flawed by distracting things like the love interest for Sinatra ( JANET LEIGH ) in a totally unnecessary sub-plot that does nothing to further the action . John Frankenheimer gets every ounce of suspense out of pivotal scenes and you'll find yourself on the edge of your seat as the final scene unfolds . A final word about the performances : ANGELA LANSBURY has never been more mesmerizing .
446154	1048771	48449	7.0	Delightful cartoon highlights a singing frog . . .	Anyone who's ever had a frog in his voice should enjoy this endearing cartoon from Chuck Jones . Not only is the frog beautifully animated when he goes into his song and dance routines , but the songs range from " Hello , Ma Baby " to an operatic aria from " The Barber of Seville . " The simple story has an unusual premise . A man discovers a frog living inside the cornerstone of a building just demolished . The frog emerges in fine singing form , demonstrating that he's very much alive and can sing and dance . Immediately the man has dollar signs in his eyes and decides to make the rounds of agents willing to feature his singing frog as the main attraction . Has to be one of the most original of all the Chuck Jones cartoons , fresh and funny as ever despite the crazy concept of a singing and dancing frog . ( Or because of ) . An absolute delight .
447980	1048771	47396	8.0	In a world where nobody ever heard of window blinds . . .	While I thoroughly enjoyed REAR WINDOW and think it's among Hitch's best films , I always observe how easy it was for Stewart's character to view the lives around him . It seems that nobody in the entire neighborhood ever heard of keeping curtains or window blinds in more discreet positions . We are forced to believe that all of these people leave their windows totally exposed to the naked eye even though they face an apartment building not more than fifty feet away , and even when scantily clad or seeking a romantic rendezvous . Of course , little do they suspect that a wheelchair-bound photographer is stalking them through his binoculars and keeping tabs on their everyday quirks and foibles . This is where the story taps into the psyche of the main character , brilliantly played by JAMES STEWART . He gets excellent support from a first-rate cast , although I think GRACE KELLY was a bit arch as his female companion . However , it's RAYMOND BURR ( as a man Stewart suspects has killed his wife ) , JUDITH EVELYN ( as " Miss Lonelyhearts " ) , WENDELL COREY ( as a skeptical detective ) , and most of all , THELMA RITTER as a wise-cracking nurse , who really stir things up . Hitchcock shows complete control of his camera , forcing us to view everything just the way Stewart sees things and focusing our attention where it ought to be through the development of the story , which is loosely based on a Cornel Woolrich short story . It's the kind of film where you have to be watching and on the alert all the time so as not to miss anything . Highly satisfying and typically good Hitchcock suspense that builds to a tense stand-off at the climax .
446520	1048771	38975	9.0	Atmospheric old dark house thriller . . . quiet but deadly . . .	For sheer mastery in the art of black and white photography and its ability to provide the shadowy atmosphere necessary for mood , they don't come any better than this . The house alone is as much a part of the plot as the actors - - but everything clicks . . . the acting , the script , the story , the direction and the brooding atmosphere that lets you know you're in for an intense and absorbingly suspenseful story . All of the suspense is relieved occasionally with just the right amount of humor . Particularly by Elsa Lanchester as the housekeeper who uses trickery to steal an extra bottle of liquor from the wine cellar . While thunder and lightning storms outside the mansion , we know that a serial killer is lurking on or near the premises , one who specializes in murdering women with physical afflictions . At the center of the story is Dorothy McGuire's character , a mute girl who lost her voice years ago during a traumatic experience . Around her are a number of people , all of whom become suspicious as the plot thickens - - Kent Smith , Rhonda Fleming , George Brent , Ethel Barrymore and Gordon Oliver . Ethel Barrymore is especially good as a frightened old woman , bedridden and suspicious enough of everyone . For comparison , view the recent color TV adaptation , bland in overall effect . It will make you appreciate this black and white classic more than ever . As with most remakes , it doesn't stand a chance against the original . My only complaint is that DOROTHY McGUIRE does not have much range in her expressions . Wide-eyed , but seldom wild , her restraint limits the amount of fear her character can express without using her voice . A more over-the-top performance might have been more useful , given the Gothic mood created so well by director Robert Siodmak . She is overshadowed by Ethel Barrymore as a bed-ridden invalid urging her to leave the house and Gordon Oliver , as the playboy step-brother who plays his role to the hilt . GEORGE BRENT does nicely for the most part , but seems too laid back in the final scenes to be as menacing as he is meant to be . Still , well worth watching for its shadowy Victorian atmosphere alone .
445672	1048771	29843	10.0	Welcome to Sherwood , my lady !	If there is any film that Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland will be remembered for ( as screen partners ) it's ' The Adventures of Robin Hood ' . It has become one of the most beloved storybook films of all time - - action , romance , majestic sets and music , a sparkling script with many juicy lines and all of the swashbuckling swordplay done with great flourish and style . The highlight of the many action scenes is the duel between Flynn and Rathbone as they overturn heavy tables and candelabra , all the while exchanging some blustery dialogue . As for Flynn and de Havilland , their screen chemistry was never more obvious . Claude Rains and Basil Rathbone make a memorable pair of villains and the remarkable cast includes sterling performances from Melville Cooper , Ian Hunter , Una O'Connor , Alan Hale , Eugene Palette , Montagu Love and Patric Knowles . It's a fairytale version all done up in gleaming technicolor , the action and romance made even more impressive by Korngold's exquisite Oscar-winning score . The romantic highlight is the scene in Marian's bedchamber , a Romeo-and-Juliet-like moment with Flynn climbing a vine to her balcony to woo his damsel in distress . The archery tournament sequence is a joy to behold - - and de Havilland was never more beautifully photographed than in her reaction close-ups as she realizes the tournament is a trap . Una O'Connor is a joy as her loyal servant and Alan Hale makes a wonderful Little John . In fact , all of the supporting roles are perfectly cast . Rousing entertainment that has charmed the socks off everyone since its release in 1938 and outclasses the Kevin Costner version in every way possible . Long live the bandit of Sherwood Forest ! ! And last but not least , Erich Wolfgang Korngold's classic score remains one of the finest film scores ever , sweeping , majestic and always complimenting the on-screen action and romance . The new Ultra-Resolution process on the 2-Disc DVD gives an image that is probably better than when actually released in 1938 , when it opened to rave reviews at Radio City Music Hall .
