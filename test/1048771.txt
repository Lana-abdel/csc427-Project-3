445355	1048771	385560	2.0	Insufferable . . . schlock of the worst kind . . . a stupid waste of time . . .	SCHLOCK would have been a better title for this absurd excursion into a poor excuse for a fright flick . Nothing redeems it . Not the story , the sub-par acting from a mostly teen cast , the witless dialog , the tired old explanation for all the goings on , and the complete lack of logic . Whenever things get dull , another fright scene with someone gurgling on blood or turning into a gooey monster of decomposing flesh , is supposed to provide the kind of shock appeal to target a young audience . Let's hope the kids today are a bit more discriminating in their taste for horror . This one is below the mark all the way . The only redeeming feature is the sleazy look of the abandoned hospital grounds . Enough to make your skin crawl , disgustingly dirty , rundown and evil looking . But the story and the characters are an insult to anyone's intelligence , poorly acted and directed to make this a complete waste of time . A writer like Stephen King could have done something with the basic idea - - but it's too late now .
446905	1048771	66393	4.0	Gorgeous Norwegian scenery in search of a plot . . .	SONG OF NORWAY is an unbearably dull musical pastiche of clichés heard in every musical ever made that purported to be the saga of a composer's struggles to find recognition for his music . Edvard Grieg's struggles are so dull as to be non-stop in this awful compilation of Norwegian scenery by the truckload with no story to carry it . It is notable that the man who plays Grieg , TORALV MAURSTAD , never did make another American film , so disastrous were the reviews and box-office for this dull saga . Note also that FLORENCE HENDERSON was not able to make another film in Hollywood but went directly to television and stayed there for a very successful run on " The Brady Bunch " . See the film and you will judge yourself why it was an abject failure . And don't be fooled by the presence of OSKAR HOMOLKA , EDWARD G . ROBINSON and ROBERT MORLEY in the cast . They have little or nothing to do . Music lovers may be enchanted by Grieg's works , but not the way they are presented here . Nor is there any resemblance between the zestful SOUND OF MUSIC and its picturesque way of dealing with the Von Trapp Singers and this dull as dishwater musical that would work better as a travelogue of Norway with the plot excised . See it at your own risk .
446708	1048771	29804	4.0	Dreary stuff . . . RKO giving Fontaine the starlet treatment . . .	A man runs for mayor on a bet . The mayor's daughter meets him at a political campaign and it's hate at first sight . The chill only lasts until their next encounter , but by then we know this is a formula romantic comedy and they'll both be in love for the windup . After a few more misunderstandings , PRESTON FOSTER and JOAN FONTAINE walk off arm in arm and the simple plot is over in an hour . Strictly an RKO programmer that passed the time in ' 37 , a time when JOAN FONTAINE was being promoted as a new RKO starlet but given material that would have defeated any other ingenue . There is nothing here that suggests she would go on to an Oscar-winning career . PRESTON FOSTER carries the main burden , as does Herbert Mundin as his timid valet , and the whole thing has the look of a B-film that nobody had much faith in . Interesting only to see the two leads in their prime but with very little chemistry between them . Trivia note : Whether it's because his make-up is too dark or not , even in B & W Foster's eyes come across as bluer than Paul Newman's .
445794	1048771	29654	4.0	Rival newspaper reporters have stormy romance . . .	There isn't anything in THERE GOES MY GIRL that hasn't been done before in screwball comedies of the ' 30s and ' 40s . This has the feisty ANN SOTHERN playing a game of oneupmanship with would be hubby GENE RAYMOND , both of them cheated out of getting married by their scheming boss RICHARD LANE . The story is absurd , the plot contrivances are everywhere , and it's just a matter of time before Sothern and Raymond are able to tie the knot by using physical restraint on Lane to keep him from interfering with their nuptial ceremony . It's old hat stuff given a little too much zest from pert ANN SOTHERN , at her feistiest , and GENE RAYMOND , trying hard to be a comedian but not exactly a master of disguises . His French accent is a disgrace . Newspaper stories were quite the fad in the ' 30s and this is just another one of those fast paced comedies that makes absolutely no sense when you stop to think about it . Other stars , like Rosalind Russell , Jean Arthur , Claudette Colbert , Irene Dunne and even Bette Davis , did similar screwball newspaper stories but with much better scripts .
445333	1048771	79152	4.0	Dumas ' tale of twin brothers strikes out this time . . .	It's strange that THE FIFTH MUSKETEER leaves me with the impression that it's hardly worth watching despite a stellar cast and some gorgeous Austrian scenery . BEAU BRIDGES ( in a dual role as a commoner and Louis XIV ) does a competent but bland job in the film's major role , while assorted guest stars fill the supporting cast with some name value . One of the guest stars is OLIVIA DE HAVILLAND who might just as well have phoned in her role . She has about three minutes of screen time , at the most . None of the main roles are really fleshed out and the plot is a muddled mess . JOSE FERRER , CORNEL WILDE , ALAN HALE , JR . and LLOYD BRIDGES are competent enough as the four musketeers while REX HARRISON and HELMUT DANTINE merely add some name recognition to the cast , as does de Havilland in her tiny role as Queen Anne ( about whom little is explained ) . It's a retread of familiar material done much better in the past , territory that would be revisited in the future with even more dash and vigor . A sleep inducing film that probably only gets male attention because URSULA ANDRESS and SYLVIA KRISTEL provide some feminine pulchritude in provocative period costumes . The most unforgivable aspect are the fight scenes of the swashbuckling kind but badly choreographed duels , unlike the sort of thing done so splendidly in the Flynn epics . The blades flash without much flourish . Summing up : Totally uninspired piece of work notable only for some lavish costumes and good location photography in Austria .
446946	1048771	29454	4.0	Insufferable comedy of manners . . . too quaint , too precious for words . . .	No wonder KATHARINE HEPBURN was considered box-office poison around the time of QUALITY STREET . As a James M . Barrie heroine , she's as mannered and coy as ever in a silly , very dated comedy of manners that never manages to be the witty romp it strives to be . Only FRANCHOT TONE gives the story any semblance of wit or reality , looking handsome and fit as the suitor who finally sees through the deception around him . James M . Barrie has had little success in being transferred to the screen , except , of course , for his PETER PAN . His other works became feeble domestic comedies on screen - - namely " Alice Sit By the Fire " which became DARLING , HOW COULD YOU ? with Joan Fontaine , and worst of all , QUALITY STREET . Both deserve to be forgotten . I would venture to guess that this is the sort of dated period fluff that gives films of the 1930s a bad name . ( Unfairly so , since many films of the ' 30s were deservedly praised ) . It's so stylized in its comedy , so forced in its humor that even the wonderful ERIC BLORE is at a loss as to just how many double takes he should do . Even such wonderful actresses as ESTELLE WINWOOD and FAY BAINTER have a hard time doing anything with their material . Do yourself a favor and skip this one . Not even the staunchest James M . Barrie fan will want to sit through it . Trivia note : If you're alert enough , you can catch Joan Fontaine in a bit role .
447552	1048771	29496	4.0	Benchley in another one of his supposed amusing lectures . . .	I don't know whether my sense of humor is amiss , but frankly I never find these dry ROBERT BENCHLEY short subjects very intriguing or all that original . He gives a lecture facing the camera on the " romantic " process of digestion , complete with a chart that shows the course food must take when it enters the human body . He talks of the teeth being " sentinels " before food is allowed to be tasted on the tongue and thereafter follows the usual progress toward the stomach , where it plays around in the " playground " area before going on to other digestive chores . The chart with its various markings is supposed to be funny . Neither illuminating nor very witty , if it manages a few chuckles it's lucky . Benchley is as intentionally unconvincing as ever and since the man has all the charisma of a wet sponge , it's just not my cup of tea . Dry - - very dry instead of droll .
447420	1048771	79319	4.0	What were they thinking ? ? ? . . . awful remake of classic John Ford film . . .	Although this is a remake of the famous and far superior John Ford masterpiece , HURRICANE manages to be one of MIA FARROW's least impressive jobs as an actress - - not entirely her fault since the script , based this time on the Nordhoff-Hall novel , is a mess . It's really not the same storyline used in the Ford film . The only similarity to the original is that it ends with a furious hurricane that cost $22 million to recreate but doesn't save the disastrously weak story from being anything but an unmitigated bore . The love interest is practically non-existent , consisting of close-up stares between Mia and her island sweetheart . Whenever there is any dialog , it's about as clumsy as can be . ( Example : When he proposes that they elope , he says : " Come to the altar with the white flower - - I will be there with the red . " ) Somebody should of been there with some directorial talent . Jan Troell falls far short of John Ford , as does the script . Usually , it's worth it to sit through a boring romance to see the howler of a hurricane . In this case , not so .
447500	1048771	82766	4.0	Never able to watch the whole film . . . Dunaway is strictly a caricature . . .	I'm not even one of JOAN CRAWFORD's biggest fans , but I think what they've done with the novel MOMMIE DEAREST is totally stupid and unworthy of any sort of detailed film comment . Not that I had any hopes that the screen version would be on a quality level with Masterpiece Theatre . Hardly that . But it certainly trashes the movie star with incidents that seem exaggerated to hold the attention . FAYE DUNAWAY's Joan Crawford is the sort of caricature that would be more appropriate on the Carol Burnett Show , where famous screen heroines were often ribbed in their award-winning roles . She indulges in a series of poses guaranteed to draw derisive laughter . There are limits to anyone's patience and even for the sake of a few laughs ( or chuckles , to be more exact ) , this is such a poor imitation of the book that it's no wonder Dunaway had any professional reputation after making it . Not that the novel had any real literary merit , but at least it did provide some insight into Crawford's psyche and the reader was free to decide when creative license was taken . It's all one big clichéd treatment , as glossy and artificial as any Joan Crawford film ever was . Any resemblance between the creature pictured here and reality is purely coincidental . . . at least that's what the foreword to this film should have warned the audience for the sake of warning the gullible not to believe everything depicted here . This is schlock of the worst kind , an insult to plain intelligence and too scmaltzy to convince me that it rings of the truth . There is no balance to the treatment . All of it is painted in broad strokes that verge on caricature , more and more so as the film goes on . Summing up : Worth skipping . Trivial and artificial .
446759	1048771	39098	5.0	The sparkle is missing in flat comedy	Before Olivia de Havilland made her remarkable comeback in 1946's To Each His Own , she stepped in as a last minute replacement for Paulette Goddard in ' The Well Groomed Bride ' , her first film after her two year legal battle with Warner Bros . Unfortunately , the script is so slight ( about de Havilland and Milland fighting over rights to the last champagne bottle in San Francisco - - she wants it for her wedding , he wants it to christen a ship ) . The laughs are scant although Olivia , Ray Milland and Sonny Tufts try hard to keep things bubbling . De Havilland manages to be pert and pretty as the heroine , Milland is his usual adept self at comedy and even Sonny Tufts manages to make his big " conceited muscle " role likeable at times - - but the whole thing fails to get off the ground . The weak script defeats everyone , including Percy Kilbride as de Havilland's dad . Only avid fans of Ray Milland or de Havilland should watch this one - - which does not turn up on TV these days - - Paramount obviously deciding it wasn't worth saving .
447543	1048771	442685	5.0	Geraldine McEwan is not Miss Marple according to Christie . . .	There are so many departures from the original story in A MURDER IS ANNOUNCED , but unfortunately the biggest departure of all is GERALDINE McEWAN as Agatha Christie's Miss Jane Marple . McEwan never suggests a clever old lady able to assimilate information while never dropping her knitting , deceptively fooling others into thinking that she's incapable of solving murders . Instead , McEwan comes cross as a sly old lady , sticking her nose into the affairs of others in a manner that borders on cunning deceit instead of a simple desire to get at the truth . She never looks as though she's pensive and thoughtful enough to solve anything , the way JOAN HICKSON did in her brilliant interpretation of Miss Marple . Furthermore , the complicated plot has been tampered with to the extent that it doesn't even follow Christie's tale with any accuracy . If you want to see the definitive version of this clever Christie story , you owe it to yourself to watch the 1985 version which remains one of the best TV adaptations of a Christie novel by sticking fairly closely to the original plot .
446344	1048771	26525	5.0	Curiously flat comedy has a silly script but is still fun to watch . . .	In spite of everything that's wrong with IN PERSON , I stayed with it till the end , enjoying whatever chemistry there was between GINGER ROGERS and GEORGE BRENT in a very lightweight comedy that suffers from heavy handling and a contrived script . The story has about three places where the ending was in sight and then more material was added to draw out further plot complications . You'll see what I mean if you watch the movie . Rogers plays a pampered movie star who takes a swift trip to the country to get away from it all , with the help of GEORGE BRENT , who at first thinks she's the plain Jane girl he bumps into in a city elevator . She's wearing a ridiculous disguise and a hat with a veil that completely covers her face . Underneath the veil we discover she's wearing a buck teeth disguise with a black wig and glasses . The plot has her doctors advising her to wear a disguise if she's afraid of being mobbed by fans . Naturally , once she takes off her disguise it's only a matter of time before Brent will be attracted to her . The screwball elements get even sillier as the plot thickens and the material wears thin long before the film is over . Worthwhile only for Ginger's fans , who at least get to see her sing and dance in a couple of sequences - - although none of the musical moments compare to anything she did with Astaire . In fact , they're staged rather clumsily and the songs are hardly what you'd call memorable . As a compensation , George Brent is a bit livelier than usual in a romantic comedy role . Summing up : A misfire of a screwball comedy with poor Alan Mobray getting the worst of the deal .
447904	1048771	30413	5.0	Crawford in above average Cinderella story . . . from rags to riches . . .	JOAN CRAWFORD plays a tenement girl with a Park Avenue accent no matter how much she has to sweat in a factory for a living . She hates her tenement environment so much that she's willing to run off with boyfriend ALAN CURTIS at the drop of a hat . Of course , what seemed like a good idea changes drastically once she meets wealthy SPENCER TRACY and realizes what her life could be as " a lady " . LEO GORCEY is a howl as her nasty kid brother . That's the main thrust of MANNEQUIN - - a sort of " money can't buy happiness " theme that is played out in typical ' 30s style with Joan Crawford giving her fans a rags to riches story tailored to please depression weary audiences . Despite the fact that Crawford seems too cultured to be playing a girl from the city flats , she's convincing enough as the newly married woman who croons a song to Curtis on the dance floor , a little something called " Always and Always " . Curtis has the role of a thankless heel and plays it to the hilt . Tracy is so enamored with " the awfully sweet kid " that you know the Curtis / Crawford marriage is headed for the rocks . Thanks to the natural performances of Tracy and Crawford , it all works better than it sounds on paper - - due also to Frank Borzage's fine direction and ELIZABETH RISDON's performance as Crawford's hard-working mother who doesn't want her daughter to give up her dream . Whether slumming or enjoying the posh life among the idle rich , Crawford never loses her poise and gets to toss off some smart lines . No matter how poor she's supposed to be , her clothes never look like they came off thrift shop racks . She photographs attractively with a softer look than her later image would have , so this is a real treat for Crawford fans . Especially when she becomes a " mannequin " at a posh fashion show , attired in some of Adrian's most outrageous gowns . The good chemistry with SPENCER TRACY helps a lot . " It all started when you slugged me , " says Tracy , proposing marriage to her . Will she or won't she find true happiness with a rich man ? Hint : It ends with another slug . Summing up : Fun for true Crawford fans , but others may find it's all a little too artificial for comfort .
447135	1048771	39402	5.0	Bleak and brooding story of a fugitive priest . . .	It's easy to see why THE FUGITIVE was a critical and commercial box-office failure . For some reason , none of Graham Greene's novels transfer well to the screen . The somber stories are all too melodramatic and heavy-handed , and this is no exception . Furthermore , in the role of the fugitive priest south of the border , HENRY FONDA looks decidedly uncomfortable throughout . This time John Ford struck out . The story is drab , downbeat and depressing - - and both HENRY FONDA and DOLORES del RIO seem to be acting for the camera in a style that approaches silent screen acting in the worst possible way - - especially during the opening scene . Del Rio is so artificial , she seems to be posing dramatically for every close-up . Even PEDRO ARMENDARIZ overdoes the villainous swagger and sneer and J . CARROL NAISH overacts in the role of an informant . Between acting styles and the extravagant use of symbolism , this is a film of many flaws , most of them in the direction and heavy-handed script . A critical failure at the time , it is in no way the masterpiece some are calling it among the user comments here . No Ford film would be complete without WARD BOND turning up as " El Gringo " . At least he gives the film a touch of grim realism . The busy background score by Richard Hageman is no help at all and seems more appropriate for the score of a silent film .
446148	1048771	39365	5.0	A few musical highlights but this is the pits for plot and acting . . .	THE FABULOUS DORSEYS is , as Maltin says , " a limp musical " , largely because neither JIMMY or TOMMY DORSEY can act their way out of a paper bag and the screenplay is hardly an inspired piece of writing . The most ingratiating performers are JANET BLAIR and WILLIAM LUNDIGAN , supplying the love interest as members of the band , and at least add some necessary glamor to the proceedings . SARAH ALLGOOD and ARTHUR SHIELDS are the Irish parents of the boys , who had a fighting relationship since childhood . The film depicts how this temperamental nonsense continued into their adult life as band leaders who argued about everything , especially music . Only after their father dies and Blair schemes a way to get the band leaders together again for a concert , does the story reach a reasonably happy ending . We get snatches of some of their song hits , including the memorable " Green Eyes " and " Marie " , and Bob Eberle and Helen O'Connell get to do their thing with a song , but the swing music isn't enough to compensate for a thin , contrived plot line . Furthermore , the print shown on TCM was pretty rough around the edges , no better than a third rate Public Domain print . Summing up : The Dorseys deserved better than this .
447361	1048771	26424	5.0	You have to be a Margaret Sullavan fan to appreciate this one . . .	Here's a film that did succeed as a charming comedy when it first opened at Radio City Music Hall back in 1935 , based on a play by Molnar that had been a very successful stage comedy . And given the fact that MGM produced it with a handsome cast and gave it a director like William Wyler , it ought to be something to shout about . Not so . MARGARET SULLAVAN , first of all , is an acquired taste . She's not a conventional Hollywood face by any means - - in fact , she's really a drab little wren - - but with MGM's make-up department and some softly appealing close-ups , she makes a presentable leading lady . It's her voice and mannerisms that you have to get used to - - much the way Katharine Hepburn took the country by storm and then was declared " box-office poison " when she became too mannered . The story is a trifle with a naive girl re-arranging the lives of three men she tries to help - - but caught up in a web of deception . The well meaning girl has a waiter , a lawyer and a rich magnate all in a stew once she starts her fibs . This was re-made in the ' 40s as a Deanna Durbin film with music , of course , and maybe that's what helped I'LL BE YOURS become a more sprightly version of the tale . This is strictly for fans of Margaret Sullavan as the story and situations are a bit too contrived for comfort . HERBERT MARSHALL as the lawyer , REGINALD OWEN as the waiter and FRANK MORGAN as the millionaire all do well enough but no one can overcome the fanciful script that is more foolish than funny .
447666	1048771	30302	5.0	Definitely not one of Shirley's best . . . below average vehicle . . .	There is such a lackluster quality about JUST AROUND THE CORNER - - everything from script to performances to the songs - - is below average . And Shirley is not quite as cute as the story wants her to be - - clearly , she is starting to develop into a chubby preteen youngster with just a modicum of talent left over from her earlier films as a tot . Only a couple of the songs are pleasant enough to be worth mentioning - - " A Happy Little Ditty " and " A Walk in the Rain " have the kind of charm expected in a Temple musical . But staging of the numbers and overall set decoration leaves a lot to be desired . Bert Lahr and Joan Davis are on hand as a chauffeur and a maid but both are defeated by some flat one-liners . Charles Farrell is clearly past his career as a romantic leading man and is just so-so as Charlie's depressed father on the skids . For Temple fans only - - weaknesses in both script and song numbers - - and not much else can be said for it . It's all very routine and quite forgettable .
445931	1048771	39283	5.0	Dr . Ordway can't take a vacation from crime in Paris . . . one of the weaker entries . . .	This Dr . Ordway story has to be one of the weaker entries in the series . First of all , there's too much exposition going on for the first half-hour , all talk and no action . The plot involves art forgeries , art dealers , a painter who specializes in making copies of original art , and a knife-throwing act - - all of which take up a lot of time for WARNER BAXTER to unravel . Through it all , we get an assortment of authentic French accents from most of the cast , with the exception of STEVEN GERAY who plays the art dealer . But as in all the Dr . Ordway stories , his scheme to hold an auction is really a trap to catch the killer . Despite all the exposition , the plot is a murky one that seems a bit far-fetched when you stop to think about it . The only other actor in the cast known to American audiences is EDUARDO CIANNELLI as the knife-thrower who becomes just one of the suspects until he unceremoniously dies in his sleep . This plot device doesn't leave much surprise in the revelation of the actual thief and murderer . Summing up : The other crime doctor films are much better than this one .
445729	1048771	56937	5.0	An overstuffed turkey , opulent but induces drowsiness after first 45 minutes . . .	If it hadn't been the tabloid headlines screaming about the love affair between ELIZABETH TAYLOR and RICHARD BURTON on the set of CLEOPATRA in Rome , it's unlikely Fox would have released this epic without trimming even more than they did . It still doesn't work . The trims were not enough and the film is a boring mess by the time it reaches the end of its first forty-five minutes . Let's face it , Elizabeth Taylor sounds like a shrill fish wife whenever her emotions show any temperament - - in other words , her vocal abilities are not good enough to carry the role of a woman who commanded all of Egypt with her willpower and determination and cunning . She's much better in other contemporary roles , but ill suited to play the Queen of Egypt . REX HARRISON gives the only full-bodied performance in the film and unfortunately he's killed midway and is missing from the rest of this gargantuan bore . Technical brilliance in costumes and sets cannot atone for a bad script and some lifeless performances from a large cast . Only RODDY McDOWALL emerges triumphant as Octavius ( probably one of his best adult roles ) , but RICHARD BURTON is another casualty as a supposedly impassioned Marc Antony . Cleopatra's eye-filling entrance makes a stunning cinematic treat , but Taylor in later years confessed that she was sick upon seeing the film at a premiere and has since confided that she hates it . I can understand why , even if legions of her fans still think it's one of the best things she ever did . Sorry , I just can't see it that way , much as I love Liz in her best work .
447294	1048771	22453	5.0	Garbo / Gable chemistry wasted on weak romantic plot . . .	GRETA GARBO fans will undoubtedly forgive the screenplay which has Greta and CLARK GABLE romantically involved in an on again / off again relationship that is the basis for the whole movie . And , of course , Garbo's favorite cinematographer , William Daniels , is behind the camera making sure that she gets her fair share of lush close-ups . It starts out promisingly enough as a Gothic melodrama with Garbo fleeing the advances of a drunken fiancé ALAN HALE and rushing out into the storm . She seeks shelter in a barn but is discovered by CLARK GABLE who promptly takes a shine to her and invites her to take shelter under his roof . The opening scenes with Garbo and Gable have an innocent charm that makes them delightful to watch , with Gable giving a more natural performance than Garbo who already has a bag of transparent acting tricks . The plot thickens when Susan Lenox is forced to flee Gable's residence when her strict father and fiancé show up to bring her home . She ends up taking refuge on a circus train and ends up being " kept " by one of the managers . When she's reunited with Gable , it begins a series of misunderstandings . Garbo plays her role like the real diva she was , even pronouncing Gable's name - - " Rodney " - - in a melodramatic way . It's strictly downhill into pulp romance territory for the rest of the way . It's Gable who gives one of his most likable performances and sustains interest in the story's development - - not Garbo . Summing up : Only for die-hard Garbo fans . Noteworthy for a very fine beginning which soon lapses into mediocrity .
447788	1048771	53219	5.0	A quickie capitalizes on the popularity of the original . . .	BRETT HALSEY is one of those handsome young actors from the ' 50s who never quite made it to stardom , and following the trend of other such actors , he fled to Europe where he found a niche for a decade or so in adventure films . He was certainly a competent enough actor and it's a shame Fox never groomed him for major stardom . Nor did Fox have enough faith in this one to use technicolor ( as they did for the original ) . As sequels go , it's just a fair job on an obviously shoestring budget - - and basically , without giving any of the storyline away , it's a story of revenge . It's all suitably photographed in low key B & W lighting that gives it the proper atmosphere . The performers are capable enough - - including Halsey , Vincent Price , John Sutton and Dan Seymour - - but their material is scarcely worthy of their combined talents . Fans of this sort of science fiction will no doubt find it has a certain amount of interest . Anyone who enjoyed " The Fly " will want to see this and probably not be too critical of the shortcomings - - although the special effects are not quite as harrowing as they could be . Summing up : Okay for a viewing , but not likely to be the kind of horror flick anyone will want to revisit .
447132	1048771	47209	5.0	Inferior remake of " The Lodger " has Palance as The Ripper . . .	Based on " The Lodger " by Marie Belloc Lowndes , this is another take on the Jack the Ripper legend that takes place in Victorian London's West End side . Sinister looking JACK PALANCE is perfectly well cast as the young man seeking lodgings in a rooming house during a period when the city is aghast over a series of brutal murders . The story begins with ISABEL JEWELL as a " lady of the night " getting her comeuppance from The Ripper . Produced by Fox at a time when the studio system was collapsing , it looks as though it was filmed on the quick ( and cheaply ) , using sets from other Fox films , particularly the atmospheric London streets with cobblestone and gaslights , a village set often used in Fox films of the period . Although it follows the Ripper story faithfully , there's nothing new about the presentation . Secondary roles are filled by lesser names like RHYS WILLIAMS and CONSTANCE SMITH and one gets the feeling it's strictly been given perfunctory treatment by writers and director . Smith is a very pretty lady but fails to make the same sort of impression Merle Oberon did in " The Lodger " in the same role of the showgirl . BYRON PALMER is rather colorless as a police inspector who falls in love with Smith . Strangely enough , JACK PALANCE is never as menacing as Laird Cregar was in " The Lodger . " There's more of the " smokehouse ham " in his performance than anything else . Summing up : The Ripper tale has been done better countless times .
445395	1048771	57026	5.0	Unsuccessful film is well acted by Mel Ferrer in title role . . .	EL GRECO tackles the life of the famous artist who spent most of his life in Toledo , Spain and whose paintings are marked by his unique style of portraying church figures and the common man . But this film is a weak attempt that lacks substance in telling the painter's story which , for dramatic conflict , involves his brush with the Spanish Inquisition and eventual dismissal of the charges , which changed his life forever . MEL FERRER is admirable in the title role , the costumes and sets filmed in Madrid are sumptuous and some of the supporting roles are well played , especially RENZO GIOVAMPIETRO as Brother Felix ( who sounds an awful lot like Leo Genn in " Quo Vadis " ) . But the final scenes with Elk Greco immersing himself in the world of the common man and the insane , are a mishmash and end the film on a weak note . The choral work is effective but becomes almost too obtrusive before the film is over . Hopefully , some day someone will do a film on " El Greco " that is as substantial as the earlier Hollywood film on " Rembrandt " and the Van Gough treatment in " Lust for Life " . But EL GRECO is flawed by a weak script and slow pacing under the direction of Luciano Salce . Not recommended .
445181	1048771	70040	5.0	Too uneventful . . . fails to make a point with nothing more than haunting imagery . . .	I have to confess that I had to stop watching more than halfway through because tedium overcame my ability to concentrate on more of this sensitive film from Spain about youth and lost innocence . At least that's what I think the filmmaker was trying to develop , but the theme remained pretty obscure up until the point I stopped watching . The photography is gorgeous and vistas of Spain , supposedly during the ' 40s under Franco's rule , are intriguing , if a bit barren . The early scenes of the villagers gathering to watch a movie on folded chairs in a primitive looking town hall of some kind are fascinating to watch and one hopes that some strong characterizations will be developed . But fascination soon turns to tedium when the film dwells uneventfully on two girls who have witnessed the FRANKENSTEIN movie and are caught up in the concept of the monster's contact with the little girl . From that point on , it's a film too uneventful to make a satisfying viewing experience - - at least for me . It gives no insight into the connection between the villagers and the girls and what they have experienced from seeing the film which obviously made a deep impression on the impressionistic girls . Perhaps another viewing of the complete film at some future date will change my mind , but for now I can't give this a strong recommendation . Deliberately ambiguous until the end , it fails to connect the dots .
447261	1048771	35675	5.0	Nancy Walker's film debut . . . she steals the spotlight from Ball . . .	Here's a movie I adored when I was a kid , thrilled by " Buckle Down Winsocki " , the spirited song sung at a military academy by a bunch of singing , dancing and marching cadets . But seeing the film now , is a real letdown . It's below par in every department . At second glance , it's really a minor musical with HARRY JAMES and his Orchestra and a little gal named NANCY WALKER ( making her film debut ) as the chief compensations for a script full of lame , dated one-liners and some trifling songs with bad choreography . Even the great LUCILLE BALL , as the movie star invited to the prom , has a hard time getting any laughs . She's supposed to be a faded star whose press agent talks her into accepting an invitation from TOMMY DIX , who overlooks his girlfriend VIRGINIA WIEDLER because of his crush on Lucy . Lucy looks great and the Technicolor makes her a glamorous creature , but the script defeats everyone . It's nice seeing JUNE ALLYSON , GLORIA de HAVEN and NANCY WALKER having fun with a couple of tunes but while the picture at least got their careers off to a good start , it's no great shakes as a musical - - especially one from MGM which specialized in the very best of that ilk . NANCY WALKER struts her stuff as " Blind Date " material - - although some of the humor at her expense is a little cruel . But she's a reminder that real talent can even overcome some witless material . And I have to ask the question so many others have : whatever happened to Tommy Dix ? ? ?
447264	1048771	39819	5.0	Betty Grable is the prim and proper Miss Pilgrim . . . not good box-office . . .	THE SHOCKING MISS PILGRIM was one of the few BETTY GRABLE movies that did not bring them in at the box-office , probably because her famous legs are not in display in this story about women in the work force , circa 1870s . Instead , the usually bubbly Miss Grable is seen in demure costumes , although her blonde hair is a rather garish touch considering the era . She's paired with the rather weak DICK HAYMES , although his baritone voice lends itself nicely to a couple of Gershwin songs - - notably " Aren't You Glad We Did ? " and " For You , For Me , For Evermore " . As with all of Fox's Grable films , it's nicely photographed in Technicolor and there are supporting players like ANN REVERE and GENE LOCKHART to add a genial touch to the proceedings . The story itself concerns itself with the proper place for women at a time when they were new to the work force and found it hard to be accepted in the all male society of the office , even if they did graduate from secretarial schools . The film deals neatly with these aspects and has a certain nostalgic charm . Not one of Grable's box-office hits , probably because she was too covered up to be the glamorous Fox star of previous musicals , but modestly entertaining for fans of the genre .
447342	1048771	39853	5.0	Tiresome story depends heavily on Loy / Powell chemistry . . .	It was inevitable that " The Thin Man " series would run out of steam eventually and this last entry is probably why both Powell and Loy never made another one . The background for this mystery is a gambling boat with jazz musicians giving the film a very dated look because of all the jive talk , circa 1940s . And as usual , there are more suspects than there are murders , with Asta and Mrs . Charles trying to help Nick solve the crime . MGM spared no expense in giving the film a glossy , polished look and a sparkling supporting cast - - PATRICIA MORISON , LEON AMES , GLORIA GRAHAME , KEENAN WYNN , DEAN STOCKWELL ( then 11 ) and PHILIP REED . The problem is the usual flaw in these Nick and Nora mysteries - - the viewer never gets enough clues to solve the crime along with the two sleuths . You're just along for the ride as the two deal with a host of unpleasant characters , among whom is a murderer who invariably slips up in time for Nick to solve the crime . Summing up : Good chemistry between Loy and Powell is still there , but they get little help from a tiresome script .
447204	1048771	25872	5.0	Average B-film programmer fails to live up to its potential . . .	For a film that deals with an interesting subject like fake mediums , this ' 34 mystery / comedy fails to hit the mark . It's not particularly impressive as a mystery and the comedy is on the weak side . It's a B-film programmer with ZASU PITTS and SLIM SUMMERVILLE providing the comic relief while others carry the straight plot line . Pitts and Summerville play WILLIAM GAXTON's assistants in a magic act where he bills himself as The Great La Salle . BRUCE CABOT hires them to take part in a fake seance at a wealthy woman's home where a young woman has been receiving messages from a dead husband . RALPH MORGAN is suspected of being a swindler trying to deceive the woman at her swanky home on Long Island . Unfortunately , ZASU PITTS is saddled with a ditzy role beyond belief . And to make matters worse , nobody else in the cast has lines that are any smoother or wittier . " Not a very friendly fellow , " says Gaxton . " About as friendly as a rattlesnake , " says Summerville . That gives you an idea of the wit and sophistication . The suspense , of course , lies in finding out how the fake seance will go and who the real culprits are in the household . Not hard to guess the predictable outcome . Summing up : A clumsy mystery / comedy hardly worth bothering about .
445311	1048771	265080	5.0	Another " Dogville " short that humanizes dogs wearing costumes . . .	Some may find these shorts hilarious , but after the first few minutes it's clear that the dogs are being manipulated to assume the poses of animals talking to each other like humans , walking around on their hind legs and wearing costumes appropriate for the " characters " they're supposed to be playing . It's funny and amusing but hardly what I would call hilarious . The word " stilted " is more like it - - because it's all so obviously staged that the dogs seem more like puppets being led about by invisible strings . Having said that , if FRANCIS , THE TALKING MULE is your style of entertainment , you may fall over laughing at this nonsense . The dogs say grace at the table , fix a flat tire , go wild at a department store remnant sale , model clothes , cope with a crooked boss , and our hero and his girlfriend are separated when the boss pins a crime on the boy dog so that he can win the affection of the girl . After spending some time at the penitentiary , where some dogs are seen doing hard labor in jail clothes , the girl dog comes to the rescue and gets her boyfriend saved in time to avoid going to the chair for his crime . Says one dog to another when sampling jail food : " It ain't fit for a dog ! " Hilarius ? It depends .
447122	1048771	25919	5.0	Nothing subtle here - - a relentless shouting match from ham actors . . .	I can't join in the praise for JOHN BARRYMORE's overly hammy performance of Oscar Jaffe in Howard Hawk's screen version of the Broadway hit , TWENTIETH CENTURY . I was almost expecting Groucho Marx and the Marx Brothers to turn up at any moment , the farce is so forced and frantic once Barrymore and CAROLE LOMBARD launch into their tirades . Director Howard Hawks evidently never chose to tone down the performances by Barrymore and Lombard , both of whom are guilty of some excruciating overacting , whether intentional or not . At least some praise can go to the supporting cast , especially ROSCOE KARNS and WALTER CONNOLLY , who seem almost restrained compared to the two stars . Another welcome bit of restraint comes from RALPH FORBES as a would be suitor rebuffed by Lombard . Definitely not the sort of comedy I'd be tempted to view again . The only amusing aspect was the eccentric asylum inmate who pinned his " Repent " messages everywhere and gave Barrymore the impression that he was wealthy enough to back his play . That , at least , was worth a chuckle or two .
446605	1048771	126662	5.0	A bugle boy needs $2 to buy a horn . . . forgettable trifle from the ' 40s . . .	Harmless short subject from the ' 40s has a bugle boy story as inspiration when a black boy wants to buy a horn from a pawn shop but needs an extra $2 to cement the deal . When WALTER CATLETT and SAM LEVENE hear him actually play the horn , they think they've discovered a goldmine and offer the kid a lucrative contract . But it turns out , he only wants to get the two dollars so he can play the horn before joining the army the next day . As the end credits say : " He only loved two things - - his horn and his country ! " Film ends on a flag-waving note as the boy plays the bugle while we see a montage of soldiers training and in battle . This is the sort of cornball exercise in propaganda that audiences probably accepted in the early ' 40s but today's viewers will be a bit baffled by it .
445434	1048771	40355	5.0	A minor melodrama with standard priest role for O'Brien . . .	PAT O'BRIEN has all the Irish charm and blarney to play a priest who can fast talk his way out of any situation with consummate ease - - and it's the sort of role he could have played in his sleep by the time he made FIGHTING FATHER DUNNE . The storyline sounds like a recap of BOY'S TOWN - - without the extra punch supplied by an above ordinary script - - so the film plugs along without much steam , folksy but predictable and full of stereotyped child actors playing newspaper boys . DARRYL HICKMAN is the most prominent among them but can't do too much with his role as the most troublesome one who can't be reformed by the good intentions of Father Dunne . It's a strictly minor entry in O'Brien's career which was starting to go on the skids in the late ' 40s and played the lower half of a double bill when released in 1948 without much notice from critics or the public .
446081	1048771	16832	5.0	Silent backstage drama stars Beatrice Lillie in rare screen role . . .	There's nothing strikingly original about EXIT SMILING except for the fact that it doesn't have the usual happy Hollywood ending . It stars the incomparable BEATRICE LILLIE and FRANKLIN PANGBORN ( yes , that's right ) as a matinée idol by the name of Cecil Lovelace ! He , of course , was a great character actor who could do double takes and slow burns better than anyone except Cary Grant . It's a tale that in its essence reminds me of the Betty Hutton / John Lund starrer , THE PERILS OF PAULINE , which was also about a traveling repertory company with non-actress Betty struggling to fit in with the group of players and all of the outrageous gags that made up Hutton's comedy routines in that film . Here it's BEATRICE LILLIE mugging her way through some really funny gag situations , demonstrating why she was such a talented funny lady even as early as this silent film . She struts her stuff with gay abandon , including the scenes where she's playing the man's role in a typically passion-filled saga meant to enthrall audiences with its tragic situations . The talent does not extend to the rest of the cast , with the exception of FRANKLIN PANGBORN who is excellent as Cecil Lovelace . But JACK PICKFORD ( Mary Pickford's younger brother ) is an odd choice for leading man opposite Lillie . He has absolutely no charisma , lacks any sort of acting talent and gives a dull , lifeless performance as the small town fugitive suspected of robbery who is protected by the lovestruck Lillie and given a job in the acting troupe . A very nice complementary score by Linda Martinez can be heard whenever the film is presented on TCM . It adds a much needed touch to the comic situations . Definitely a silent film delight , well worth seeing , especially for fans of Lillie and the inimitable Franklin Pangborn .
448004	1048771	183503	5.0	Comedy / Fantasy experiments with virtual reality . . .	Strictly a hit and miss kind of thing , a chic flick for the romantically inclined types who revel in seeing a woman putting down men as worthless love objects and dreaming of an alternate life style for herself while not making any real commitments in the real world , but living in some kind of virtual reality so she can test the waters of being someone else . On the credit side , it's all very stylishly photographed in handsome settings , has a bouncy musical score to keep things moving along at a nice pace , and has a virtuoso central performance by RACHEL GRIFFITHS that would be even more charming if her character made any sense . She reminds me of the sort of appeal Betsy Drake ( American actress once married to Cary Grant ) had in films like EVERY GIRL SHOULD BE MARRIED . She has the same girlish charm and very expressive eyes and mouth that can let you know what she's supposed to be thinking , especially when glimpsed in close-up reactions . But it's as light as air , as flimsy as plots go , with some pleasant incidental scenes of families trying to bond , as for example the dinner restaurant scene with hubby , wife and children eating out in a candlelit atmosphere , including the little boy who says he " has to go to the toilet " at a picture-taking moment . These sly observations of single life vs . family gatherings give the film its human qualities . But the character of the rather neurotic young woman is only vaguely suggested and she has so many annoying traits and sudden changes of mind that it becomes frustrating to keep up with her whims . As the ending shows , she values her independence but longs for something like a relationship with her latest love , Ben , ( played with romantic finesse by attractive SANDY WINTON ) , who clearly is nuts about her . Again , she's afraid to commit . Another demerit : The fantasy angle with her double only adds to the general aimlessness of the plot . The film's chief merit is RACHEL GRIFFITHS and her winsome charm .
447682	1048771	44557	5.0	Don't bother to see it . . .	Unless you're a die-hard fan of MARILYN MONROE , this is not for you , or for anyone seeking serious adult drama . Fox evidently wanted to showcase her in a dramatic role since they were busy grooming her for major stardom - - but she would have needed a stronger script and a better director than Roy Ward Baker to pull this one off . She adopts that little girl voice and a blank stare to convey fear and vulnerability , but it doesn't work since the role is written in such a vague and uncertain way that there's not much more she can do with it . She did indeed develop her dramatic skills , but not in this role . Others around her try hard to make the drama believable . Richard Widmark and Anne Bancroft do their usual competent jobs and the supporting cast all do their roles acceptably , particularly Elisha Cook , Jr . Marilyn seems to be sleepwalking through a thinly written part . Whatever noir touches would have made the suspense more gripping and whatever more could have been done to make Monroe's role more believable , we'll never know . Her role needed more than a wide-eyed stare . As it stands , it's an amateurish attempt at playing a psychotic baby-sitter before Monroe achieved more range as a performer .
445724	1048771	25381	5.0	Early Ann Sothern film is good indication of her promise . . .	But the film itself is a dated trifle that passes the time pleasantly at a little more than an hour . ANN SOTHERN shows why her breezy charm worked magic on audiences and top-billed EDMUND LOWE , largely unknown today , is her leading man as a Hollywood director . The title tune gets a nice workout in the opening scene inside a movie studio while the plot is launched about a temperamental Swedish diva on the warpath about nobody leaving her alone ( a la Garbo ) . When she storms off the lot in a huff , guess who waltzes in - - ANN SOTHERN of course . " As long as she's Swedish , " says producer GREGORY RATOFF . So Lowe meets Sothern at a carnival and is convinced she'd make a good replacement for his Swedish diva . Sothern reluctantly agrees but says , " We'll never get away with it . " And , of course , the rest of the breezy romantic comedy ( predictable as it is ) is concerned with the transformation of Sothern into a Swedish actress and her romantic alliance with Edmund Lowe . It's a well-written , fast-moving comedy of Hollywood manners and morals and Lowe , Sothern and Ratoff manage to make it work . The youthful Miss Sothern is at her prettiest and has fun with her key role , Swedish accent and all . Summing up : Better than average comedy from Columbia , well worth watching if you're an Ann Sothern fan .
447155	1048771	25345	5.0	Wheeler and Woolsey in odd pre-code comedy . . .	Any enjoyment you get from KENTUCKY KERNELS will depend on whether or not you can view the film in the context of its time and accept all of the foolishness with that in mind . Otherwise , it's not a particularly rewarding way to view Wheeler and Woolsey . Surely , their reputation was based on better material than this . The thin plot has the boys adopting SPANKY McFARLAND from an orphanage run by MARGARET DUMONT . He's a cute little bundle but has a penchant for breaking glass at every opportunity - - and the script gives him plenty of excuses . Unfortunately , most of the gags are the kind of one-liners that must have killed vaudeville , delivered in brisk style but corny nevertheless . LUCILLE LaVERNE shows up as an old dowager ( she was the voice for The Wicked Queen in Disney's " Snow White " ) , and MARY CARLISLE is the love interest for one of the boys . The politically correct will be insulted by the WILLIE BEST racial humor in scenes where the boys go south . Strictly a product of its time , ending in a skirmish between a Hatfield and McCoy type of family feud .
446699	1048771	29179	5.0	Madame X on a budget . . . but oh , what melodramatic courtroom proceedings !	First of all , let me say that GLADYS GEORGE does a remarkably fine job as " Madame X " . But whomever decided to do the final courtroom scenes with an over-the-top argument by her lawyer son and hysterics from the woman on the stand , well . . . this maudlin scene reduces whatever credibility Miss George gives to her role . The final courtroom scenes are just too over-baked even by 1930 standards of the tear-jerker . The cast is competent enough but the production has the look of an A-film given a B-budget , helped somewhat by the presence of actors like Warren Williams , Reginald Denny and Henry Daniell in the cast . GLADYS GEORGE does the slattern extremely well , looking very much like a woman under the influence not only because of the realistic make-up but because of her very posture and mannerisms . Toward the end , during the final meeting with her son in jail , she looks like the broken woman she is supposed to be . All of this was rehashed in the 1960s with LANA TURNER in the title role . Turner was fine and almost matched George in the final scenes of degradation . But in this version , Sam Wood should have tempered the melodrama in the climactic courtroom scene . Instead , there is no restraint whatsoever . He lets JOHN BEAL ( as George's son ) go on too long on a sentimental monologue that defies credibility . This scene alone is so overplayed that it makes the film strictly a product of the 1930s . The mother / son angle of the ' 60's version ( between Turner and Kier Dullea ) was done with much more restraint and believability and had the touching effect needed to make the tear-jerker work .
446146	1048771	277866	5.0	One gag does not make a whole film . . .	Here's a Max Linder short that runs too long when it's based on a single incident at the beach . He attempts to take a photo of a woman in a bathing suit ( and she's no beauty ) , waiting while she swims around like she thinks she's an early embodiment of Esther Williams . He's waiting for her to emerge so he can snap the photo , but she fools him by diving beneath the sea ( like an overweight mermaid ) and running ashore some distance away so he doesn't see her . Naturally , he thinks she's drowned and attracts quite a crowd with his frantic arm waving , all of whom think a woman has just disappeared in the water . When she emerges from the bathhouse , fear turns to joy . That's it , for the plot . It's all very primitive looking , none of the sight gags are memorable and it runs too long - - even for a short . Summing up : Not worth a peek .
447640	1048771	28953	5.0	Garrick was supposed to be " a great actor " , not " a great ham " . . .	I anticipated getting a lot of enjoyment from THE GREAT GARRICK based on previously read reviews and the great cast involved . I was sorely disappointed . James Whale may have been a master at directing horror films but stylized comedy was not his forte . Worst offender of all is Brian Aherne ( hamming it up considerably as the great actor ) and Luis Alberni , obnoxious as a thespian anxious to do a " mad scene " . Some of the humor is painstakingly obvious with everyone determined to see who could outdo the other in shouting their lines and mugging to the nth degree . Edward Everett Horton is best with the comic lines and Melville Cooper is reasonably restrained in a good supporting role . As for the stars , Brian Aherne looks attractive as the gentleman actor but forgets that he is supposed to be a " great " actor , not a " ham " actor and overdoes his role with painful results . Olivia de Havilland is pretty as the leading lady in an ingenue role that gives her little to do but look admiringly at Aherne , which she does dutifully . If you look hard enough , you can spot Lana Turner and Marie Wilson in supporting roles as giggling players in the French company . Wilson seems to be getting in the foreground whenever possible if only to get some notice from the hapless shenanigans going on in the country inn . Disappointing , to say the least , and watchable only to see Brian Aherne and Olivia de Havilland co-starring in the same film . ( Aherne later married de Havilland's sister , Joan Fontaine ) .
447376	1048771	47688	6.0	Tasteful musical remake of " Four Daughters " . . .	FRANK SINATRA followed up his " From Here To Eternity " triumph by starring opposite DORIS DAY in a musical remake of " Four Daughters " called YOUNG AT HEART . He gets even better song material than Day , including memorable versions of " Young at Heart " and " One for My Baby " , but Day is compensated by a nice dramatic role that gets her brand of warmth and sincerity , as well as a duet with Sinatra on " You , My Love " . ETHEL BARRYMORE is the elderly aunt and ROBERT KEITH is the father , while GIG YOUNG plays the young man that Day almost marries until she discovers that her sister is broken-hearted over their upcoming marriage . Instead , she runs off with the loner , Barny ( Sinatra ) , and has a rather tumultuous marriage that she's determined to salvage . This version of the tale has her succeed , avoiding the downbeat ending of the original in which the John Garfield character ( played by Sinatra ) died . It's pleasant , nostalgic and the kind of musical they never make any more . Particularly sensitive performances from Sinatra , Day and Gig Young under Gordon Douglas ' direction . Worth seeing for fans of Day and Sinatra especially . The only big difference between this and the original is that color and music have been added . Otherwise , the script is pretty close to the 1938 version directed by Michael Curtiz .
446923	1048771	35114	6.0	Good and bad twins , courtesy of Conrad Veidt . . .	This was a nice little programmer from the ' 40s that played the lower half of double-features . CONRAD VEIDT is interesting ( as always ) as a pair of identical twins , one of whom is a Nazi agent . When the bad brother is killed , the good brother takes his place and has to convince everyone that he is the loyal Nazi . Only gradually do a couple of people come to realize who the man really is . Veidt excels in the kind of role he always fared well in , especially riveting as the bad twin . Not the leading man type , he nevertheless manages to hold the screen with his histrionic finesse at playing either smooth villains or men with deeper convictions of honor . ANNE AYARS is the lovely romantic lead and the supporting cast , which includes MARTIN KOSLECK as a fierce Nazi ( a role he's played so often and so well ) is more than adequate . Good entertainment of its kind , it's a low-budget film directed by Jules Dassin .
447836	1048771	38924	6.0	Another Pygmalion story about a concert pianist and her cruel guardian . . .	British films were beginning to attract more attention from American audiences by the time THE SEVENTH VEIL appeared on U . S . screens , and audiences took to JAMES MASON as the overly possessive guardian of ANN TODD , even though the character he played had some very unpleasant traits - - such as using his cane on the woman's fingers when a burst of temper had him out of control . It's the odd love / hate relationship between Mason and Todd that carries the film . Unfortunately , it carries it into the realm of theatricality when the relationship is shown at its most troubled stages . The film begins with the young woman attempting suicide from a bridge , and then the film becomes a study in psychological terms about the reason for her aversion to the piano with flashbacks serving as the means to unravel the cause of her illness . Some of it is very effective and certainly it's the reason JAMES MASON was discovered by Hollywood - - but it has to be viewed in the context of the time when psychology was being explored by both British and Hollywood filmmakers and audiences apparently embraced such stories . Mason's effectiveness in what could have been a highly unsympathetic role is what makes the film superior . Todd , while excellent at appearing to be a concert pianist , is less successful as a dramatic actress . A stronger performer in her role might have made the film more convincing than it is - - particularly in making the sappy ending more convincing . It appears to have been tacked on solely to please audiences rather than being a truthful outcome to a story involving such strong-willed characters .
447644	1048771	47677	6.0	Brando and his motorcycle gang ride into town . . .	MARLON BRANDO rides into town leading a pack of wild motorcycle riders who proceed to terrorize a hick town before LEE MARVIN shows up and gets into a drunken fight with Brando ( as Johnny ) . Meantime , Johnny flirts dangerously with a cop's daughter ( MARY MURPHY ) who runs a cafe . Her father is played by ROBERT KEITH , a lawman who's reticent about using his authority with a bunch of motorcycle thugs . Tension builds when Keith manages to haul Lee Marvin off to jail . Brando's buddies manage to get a hold of one of the town bullies and put him in the jail cell with the drunken Marvin who has passed out . They then go on a wild rampage but not before some of the town's men decide to form a vigilante squad and go after Brando . Brando has a brief romantic fling with the girl who realizes loving him is a lost cause . POSSIBLE SPOILER AHEAD The plot moves swiftly to a conclusion once the girl is able to convince the authorities that he wasn't responsible for the death of an elderly bystander hit by a motorcycle . Stanley Kramer production has a nice , tense background score by Leith Stevens . Summing up : Early Brando is impressive to watch , but much of the dialog is very dated and anchored firmly in the 1950s by the slang and be-bop expressions and overall concept of the film . Famous for the moment when a girl taunts him with : " What are you rebelling against ? " Brando's terse reply : " What have you got ? "
446594	1048771	30572	6.0	Enjoyable programmer with the Mauch twins in the spotlight . . .	Let's face it , the late ' 30s were different times and the kids then were on the clean-cut side with polite manners and none of them had the agenda that today's teen-agers do - - so , in this respect , PENROD'S DOUBLE TROUBLE is a dated piece from Warner Bros . aimed at the kiddie market in 1938 . It succeeds in being a harmless time passer , nothing more - - with nothing really new in its story about two boys who are so identical in appearance that even the boy's parents can't tell the difference when one of them trades places . It's typical Hollywood fluff , performed in earnest style by GENE LOCKHART , DICK PURCELL and others in the Warner stock company . Billy and Bobby Mauch are excellent , as always , playing their respective roles with professional ease and modesty . Too bad the screenplay is such a modest effort and didn't give them more substantial material to work with . Summing up : A pleasant programmer , holds the interest for its brief running time .
446764	1048771	39311	6.0	Lots of fury and lots of Technicolor in early film noir . . .	Probably the most distinguished feature of DESERT FURY is the spectacular Technicolor Paramount lavished on it , a story of personal conflicts among Nevada's gambling set . Another distinguished feature is MARY ASTOR as Fritzi , a hard-boiled dame who runs a gambling establishment and keeps a tight leash on her willful daughter ( LIZABETH SCOTT ) . Scott is strikingly photographed and reminded me of a more animated version of Veronica Lake . But complications arise when two men pay too much attention to Astor's daughter - - JOHN HODIAK ( a no good hunk who may or may not have murdered his wife ) and BURT LANCASTER as a wary police officer who keeps Lizabeth Scott on his radar at all times . It's fun as melodrama , nothing more or less , and at times achieves something of a camp classic with Astor's butch performance as she effortlessly steals the film's acting honors . Take it or leave it , it's all in good , steamy fun with lots of fury going on under those hot Technicolor lights .
447705	1048771	39409	6.0	Nice drama of early aviation pioneers . . .	Sturdy , dependable GLENN FORD gives another one of his understated but sincere performances as a young inventor , John Montgomery , in the late 1800s who makes a number of semi-successful attempts at getting his flying machine off the ground and soaring into the atmosphere . JANET BLAIR is the love interest as the childhood sweetheart who stands by her man until the end of his life . While I always liked this actress , the jarring note is her make-up which is so modern that it seems like an anachronism . She has a distinctly 1940s look about her ( lip gloss and modern hairdos ) that works against the otherwise authentic look of the film . WILLARD ROBERTSON as Ford's pa is fine but SELENA ROYLE is completely wasted in a minor role as his loving mom . William Wellman directs with a thorough knowledge of his subject and as an aviation drama it maintains interest throughout . All of the aerial scenes are well staged and look glorious in crisp B & W photography . Summing up : A very unheralded film that is certainly watchable but could have used a stronger and less sentimental script .
446474	1048771	112966	6.0	Charmingly irrelevant film about a mountain and a molehill . . .	Despite the fact that it's about almost nothing relevant to the average movie-goer , THE ENGLISHMAN WHO WENT UP A HILL BUT CAME DOWN A MOUNTAIN manages to be a charming diversion but ultimately , it's as innocuous as its title . Drawbacks aside , it does offer some hauntingly beautiful color cinematography of Welsh landscapes , day and night , blazing with beauty , some quaint village shots of pubs and lodgings that look invitingly cosy , and some sketchy characterizations that do little more than pad out a rather tedious little tale . HUGH GRANT does another one of his befuddled , amused , eyebrow lifting characterizations , complete with stutter and smile and pause between words , a role he seemed destined to repeat again and again . But he fits the role and the story - - which takes place in 1917 Wales . The jaunty musical score compensates for some slow moments but all the actors do a competent job of keeping things on a realistic level . There are no big names in the cast aside from Grant , but they all make their mark while he gets most of the footage for a rather awkward romance with a local girl who spends the night on the mountain with him . Summing up : Not much in the way of a plot , but it manages to be appealing and extremely well photographed .
447690	1048771	12938	6.0	A curiosity piece but not one of the silent greats . . .	This is proof positive that not every silent film is great or even worthy of restoration , however good the photography may be . Nor is the musical accompaniment always appropriate , as is the case here . GLORIA SWANSON and RUDOLPH VALENTINO may have been the hot twosome of the twenties , but here they hardly get a chance to do more than exchange intense glances while Swanson coyly looks away and flutters her overmade eyelashes and purses her bow-lipped mouth . Rudy is given not too much material to work with in the way of romantic lover , but he gets hero status from the fact that first he saves her from drowning , then rescues her when she falls off the rocks . Aside from her garish and non-flattering make-up , Miss Swanson does nothing to suggest why she was such a popular silent star except for the fact that she is paraded in a series of costumes that were clearly not designed by Adrian . Valentino , on the other hand , gets to look his handsome self and even dons one white outfit that flatters his swarthy good looks . Other than watching the two of them parade around in various outfits , there is nothing in this Harlequin romance that makes much sense . Her romance with a nobleman is given a conveniently happy ending when her husband nobly allows himself to be shot in the desert so that his young wife can spend the rest of her years with Valentino . Somewhere in this hopelessly old-fashioned , banal , slow moving romance there must be a message , but I'll be darned if I can find one - - except perhaps that when you're old , you should kill yourself if it will make your wife happy . As silent films go , the direction by Sam Wood is quite restrained for the time period and the photography is often artful when the film isn't having restoration problems . But this is by no means anything anyone should go out of their way to see . The story is trite , Swanson's acting is all a series of poses , and only Rudolf Valentino comes out of this smelling like a rose . At least he's natural and low-keyed and knows how to look at a woman - - which must disappoint female fans who wanted to see him and Swanson steaming up the desert with passion . Not .
445348	1048771	217696	6.0	Brief examination of the prophecies of Nostradamus . . .	This is the sort of historical short subject they used to show school kids in the auditorium in the old days of yore . It's a well produced effort from MGM , narrated by Carey Wilson , to show the influence of Nostradamus on Catherine de Medici , the wife of Henry II , King of France , who hoped to have three sons as future kings : Francis II , Charles IX and Henry III in the 16th Century . The story opens with Catherine at 70 , reflecting on the prophecies about each one which , unfortunately , came true , as each one had a life which ended tragically premature . Nostradamus is nicely played by GRANDON RHODES and Catherine by MARIA PALMER , although her age make-up leaves something to be desired . Informative , brief and entertaining , it uses clips from other MGM historical dramas to give us a glimpse of the past events cited by Nostradamus . It also includes his vision of " the great protector " and " the famed torch " ( the United States ) , long before our country even existed . Summing up : Very interesting .
447059	1048771	35770	6.0	Nurses struggle with battle conditions on Philippines during WWII . . .	CRY HAVOC follows in the tradition of films like SO PROUDLY WE HAIL by dealing exclusively with nurses in the Philippines on active duty during WWII . MARGARET SULLAVAN is the lieutenant in charge of a group of gals including ANN SOTHERN , ELLA RAINES , FRANCES GIFFORD and JOAN BLONDELL , all of whom are inexperienced but have to learn the ropes fast during wartime bombardments . Based on a play , it barely shows its stage origins and presents a gritty story of nurses under stress doing the best they can under dire circumstances . MARGARET SULLAVAN and FAY BAINTER fret over having to deal with " wet-nosed kids " ( as Sullavan calls them ) , all of them eventually becoming battle hardened after working conditions continually put them in harm's way . Watch for ROBERT MITCHUM in a brief unbilled bit as a dying soldier . Sullavan and Sothern argue over Sothern's infatuation for a man Sullavan loves and there's some trite dialog among the all-female cast when they get to exchange stories - - but it's still an above average melodrama of women nurses during war . Summing up : Worth it for the gritty wartime bombardments and interesting cast , but don't expect anything great . Richard Thorpe's direction keeps the pace steadfast without too many lulls until the downbeat ending .
446115	1048771	18097	6.0	Tantalizing reconstruction with elegant stills gives a hint of how good the film may have been . . .	Personally , I'm grateful that the elegant B & W production stills survived in order that we can see what Tod Browning's production might have looked like had it not been destroyed by fire . It also helps if you've seen Browning's remake of this same story called THE MARK OF THE VAMPIRE ( ' 35 ) with its surprise ending being made much clearer than it is in this reconstruction where there is only one caption that even hints at what was going on with the theatrics . I was captivated by the dark-haired beauty of MARCELINE DAY and appalled at the silent histrionics of CONRAD NAGEL who wore the same look of horror and disbelief in every shot . The ending was blunted without giving a full explanation for any of the doings , which is why seeing the ' 35 version is advisable for anyone who is still confused . The ' 35 version had BELA LUGOSI , LIONEL ATWILL and LIONEL BARRYMORE in key roles and was extremely well worth viewing . This silent version , reconstructed with stills , appeared to be beautifully photographed with appropriately cobweb-covered interiors and intense B & W lighting for atmospheric effects . Chaney's make-up appeared to be quite startling - - for me it was even more so than his " Phantom " disguise - - and his Inspector Burke seemed a very forceful creation judging from the intense finger waving stills . Well done reconstruction except for the weak ending which missed making its point . The background score was fine .
445183	1048771	30171	6.0	John Payne gets an early break in GARDEN OF THE MOON . . .	This little known musical comedy , very minor league in every department , gave JOHN PAYNE the kind of break that led to a seven-year contract at Fox after they saw him as the brash band leader / singer in this modest programmer . The band sequences are directed with a certain flair and flourish , thanks to director Busby Berkeley , despite the fact that this time there's no fancy choreography for him to work into the routines . And among the musicians is comic JERRY COLONNA , better known later on as Bob Hope's favorite comic foil . But PAT O'BRIEN is the star and he overacts his blustery , fast-talking nightclub manager , chewing on a cigar , in the fashion that most Warner comedies of the period thought was stylish . He plays it in broad , farcical style but gets a little overbearing for my taste , while Payne seems almost low-key by comparison . MARGARET LINDSAY is the pretty lady serving as Payne's romantic interest and is more animated than usual . It's not a bad little musical , but most of the songs are high forgettable items except for the " Whirling Dervish " number and serve only to give the story more bounce than it normally would have . Passes the time pleasantly enough , but is nothing anyone should go out of their way to see . At least JOHN PAYNE's fans get a glimpse of why he got signed to a Fox contract . CURT BOIS adds an amusing touch as a phony Maharahjah whom MELVILLE COOPER realizes is a waiter who had trouble with champagne corks and used to pinch a pocket or two in his old job as a waiter . Amusing fluff . Trivia note : JIMMY FIDLER , famous Hollywood columnist of the period , makes a brisk appearance in a supporting role and isn't bad at all .
447580	1048771	25610	6.0	Depression-era look at farming is a minor classic . . .	TOM KEENE and KAREN MORLEY are the lesser-known stars of this Depression-era classic , a poor man's " Grapes of Wrath " , about a young farming couple who use ingenuity to overcome a drought that threatens to ruin their crops . Tom Keene was a B-actor who did mostly westerns and does a sincere , earnest job of playing the kind of " everyman " role that Henry Fonda and Joel McCrea usually played in these sort of films . While he has a limited range , he makes an appealing hero , a man who fires others with his ambitious idea to build a gully for the water to reach the crops that are badly in need of water . It's this sequence , with the men following orders and digging the ditches that make a pathway for the water , that really makes the film special . Otherwise , it's a rather drab exercise in showing the downtrodden lives of farming people during the Great Depression of the ' 30s . KAREN MORLEY is lovely as the loyal woman who stands by her man and JOHN QUALEN does an effective job as a frustrated farmer . Some striking scenes for the last half-hour , but a bit heavy going before that .
445299	1048771	39441	6.0	Standard Randolph Scott film should have kept Zane Grey's original title . . .	GUNFIGHTERS is the unoriginal title for Zane Grey's " Twin Sombreros " , which , considering the story is about two sisters who are almost twin-like in appearance , would have been a more apt title for this film . The story is routine as depicted here , with bad guy BRUCE CABOT as the man responsible for a few killings over range rights on property owned by GRIFF BARNETT and his daughters BARBARA BRITTON and DOROTHY HART . RANDOLPH SCOTT is the man who rides into town at the start without his gunbelt , but by the end of the story he dons it for the final gun duel before tossing it off again and heading west for the happy ending . This is after he's fought a couple of the town bullies , including FORREST TUCKER , and won . What surprised me was how good the warm tones of Cinecolor looked , while not quite up to the standard of three-strip Technicolor . Looks as though Columbia was aiming to give the film an A-budget look . For Randolph Scott fans , it's a treat to see him in fine shape - - but the script is ordinary and the direction is uninspired . One would never guess the story is from an original penned by Zane Grey .
446455	1048771	39501	6.0	One of the more agreeable MGM musicals in B & W with Sinatra and Lawford . . .	FRANK SINATRA's voice was in a warm and mellow tone when he did IT HAPPENED IN BROOKLYN and this little musical uses him musically in a nice way . He gets to warble an invigorating ditty as a serviceman joyous to be back in Brooklyn , so he belts out " Brooklyn Bridge " with baritone finesse . It almost sounds like a number out of ON THE TOWN . But it's his mellow rendering of " Time After Time " that brings back memories of how he crooned his way to stardom and became a teen idol in the early ' 40s . Frank is a kind of shy guy here , but gets to loosen up after awhile thanks to the friendship of JIMMY DURANTE as a fellow Brooklynite , a janitor who lets Frank share his apartment until he can find a job . KATHRYN GRAYSON is the pretty girl Sinatra takes up with , both of them with singing aspirations . He even does a " Don Giovanni " duet with Grayson and it's not bad at all . Grayson does a nice solo spot on " The Bell Song " from Lakme and handles her acting chores in a pleasant enough manner . Likewise , even PETER LAWFORD gets to belt out a number for a bunch of record fans in a music store , loosening up to a little ditty called " Whose Baby Are You ? " with a swing beat . Durante and Sinatra have fun on a number called " The Song's Gotta Come from the Heart " and Sinatra is at his best crooning a ballad called " It's the Same Old Dream . " True , it's all rather formula as far as the storyline goes , but it's done in such an unpretentious way that it manages to charm most of the time . GLORIA GRAHAME has a small role at the beginning as a nurse from Brooklyn who doubts whether Sinatra hails from that borough . I can't say much for the direction of Richard Thorpe . It moves at a snail's pace through its running time of one hour and forty-five minutes .
447645	1048771	43286	6.0	Have to use the word " cute " to describe this one . . .	And that's even though I hate using that adjective to describe any movie , but this one fits the bill perfectly . PAUL DOUGLAS is a temperamental baseball player who makes a deal with a heavenly angel to curb his temper and maybe win a few games with help from above . JANET LEIGH is a girl reporter who eventually falls in love with Douglas ( hey , this is a movie ! ! ) after a rather brief courtship during which both she and Douglas fall in love with little Donna Corcoran . This little girl has one of the sweetest , most angelic faces I've ever seen on a child actress and she's got a sincerity that makes everything she says and does look perfectly natural . The orphanage where the girl is sheltered is run by SPRING BYINGTON , in one of her most unusual roles as a nun who knows baseball , and ELLEN CORBY who does a wistfully sweet job as a beaming assistant to Byington . The baseball flavor gets help from some real footage of Pirate games and some humorous clips of famous people commenting on the angel situation . Among the movie stars , Bing Crosby playing golf . The story is a morality tale done without any special effects gimmicks . I didn't see the remake , but I understand it did use CGI to make more graphic use of the angel element . KEENAN WYNN has the film's only unlikeable role as a sports announcer who's cynical about the little girl's claim that she sees angels in the outfield . Summing up : An amiable comedy , well played by Douglas , Leigh and Corcoran .
446364	1048771	39892	6.0	Oddly interesting for offbeat teaming of Temple and Reagan . . .	TV showings of ' That Hagen Girl ' became more and more rare as the years went on - - but lately it surfaced on TCM when they saluted Shirley's birthday with showings of four of her films . Basically it's a story of the effect gossip has on a small-town girl ( Temple as Mary Hagen ) and lawyer ( Ronald Reagan ) . Good performances by Rory Calhoun , Jean Porter and others . The meanness of the small-town gossip is well realized under Peter Godfrey's direction and the background score by Franz Waxman adds much to the melodramatic proceedings . Not really as bad as many would have you think . Shirley seems more poised and assured than usual ( except in an embarrassing rendition from ' Romeo and Juliet ' ) and she herself regards it as her best adult performance . Despite all of its flaws , it's worth viewing to watch the nineteen-year old actress opposite Ronald Reagan . His primary love interest in the film is Lois Maxwell ( who later became Miss Moneypenny in the James Bond films ) . The ending is rather unresolved and unsatisfying - - a curious ending for an odd film .
446374	1048771	43045	6.0	Three stars shine in low-key melodrama directed by Robert Wise . . .	Whatever suspense THREE SECRETS has is derived from the audience not knowing ( until the end ) which woman's boy has survived a plane crash . Each woman ( ELEANOR PARKER , RUTH ROMAN and PATRICIA NEAL ) thinks it's her own abandoned five year-old son . As they wait patiently for more news on the identity of the boy , each woman reflects in flashbacks on what led up to their heart-breaking decision . Robert Wise has directed all of the melodrama with some fine touches and a steady hand , so that Parker , Roman and Neal are all seen to advantage in a plot vaguely similar to that of A LETTER TO THREE WIVES in which three women await news on which husband deserted them . Parker is a woman who had an illegitimate child ; Roman had to give up her child while she served a jail term ; Neal was a career woman who preferred career to domestic chores . Sensibily acted and directed , it's a rather low-key melodrama that might not meet the demands of fans not enthusiastic about so-called chick flicks .
447825	1048771	20876	6.0	Lloyd's misadventures include the amazing building routine . . .	This is one of Lloyd's first talkies and might have played better as a silent , since most of the action revolves around a whole bunch of amusing sight gags . He's a hapless shoe salesman who tells a wealthy girl that he's a tycoon and spends the rest of the film trying to impress her after unable to leave a cruise ship before it takes off . All of the shipboard scenes are amusing but become repetitious after the first twenty minutes . Highlight of the humor is Lloyd's interaction with sailor Noah Young , adept at playing a dummy . Silly plot manipulations end up with Lloyd getting stuck inside a mailbag and somehow hoisted up the side of a building on a flimsy scaffold . It's here that the film reminds one of the silent success he had with his skyscraper routine . Although the gags are inventive and foolish enough , it's an extended sequence that plays out over too much running time . WILLIE BEST is seen as a black maintenance man who's no help at all to Lloyd when he becomes aware of his plight . It's the kind of stereotyped role that makes today's politically correct audiences squirm . Summing up : Funny in spots , but certainly not one of Lloyd's best efforts . The scaffolding gags look painfully real .
446568	1048771	29546	6.0	The magic is still there but the plot is thinner than ever . . .	The plot is a silly one that has Astaire as Petrov , ballet dancer , chasing a musical comedy star , Ginger Rogers , across the ocean with the usual amount of misunderstandings that keep them apart until the finale . But , as with all FRED ASTAIRE and GINGER ROGERS films , it's the music that counts - - and the dance numbers . Fred has an amazing " Slap That Bass " number aboard ship , one of his best solo jobs , but there are only a few other gems in the Gershwin score , like " They Can't Take That Away From Me " , " They All Laughed at Christopher Columbus " and " Let's Call The Whole Thing Off . " Somehow , they don't get the treatment they deserve but all have become popular standards . Although the songs are pleasant enough , they're not among Gershwin's best - - and the plot is so flimsy it's almost non-existent , something about Astaire and Rogers being mistaken for a married couple . Fans of the dancing stars will love it and others may find it just slightly less entertaining than some of the other Astaire / Rogers films . The supporting roles are in the capable hands of ERIC BLORE , EDWARD EVERETT HORTON and JEROME COWAN , but they've all been seen to better advantage in other screwball comedies . Mark Sandrich directed in his usual fast paced style , but I couldn't help noticing that Ginger seemed a little bored with her character .
447060	1048771	36120	6.0	Margaret O'Brien tear-jerker is better than most of her early films . . .	JAMES CRAIG and MARSHA HUNT have the adult leads in LOST ANGEL but it's obvious that MGM was hoping the vehicle , specially written for child star MARGARET O'BRIEN , would prove to boost her box-office popularity at a time when she was being groomed for big time stardom . It did . At six , she was quite a little actress , able to turn on the tears on cue and spoke in that quivering little voice that most viewers found enormously appealing . She plays a child prodigy who's been raised by a psychological clinical institute but robbed of a normal childhood . When reporter Craig is sent to do a story on her , he gets stuck with the kid because the clinic is quarantined for measles . The rest of the plot has to deal with Craig's handling of a difficult situation , including the child's jealousy over his relationship with Hunt . Margaret still had all of her childish appeal at this stage and she does well with her character , except for an unnecessary crying scene at a nightclub . Craig and Hunt exhibit some good chemistry in their byplay and are always a pleasure to watch . And , of course , there's a predictable happy ending for all . Trivia note : Sharp-eyed fans will note AVA GARDNER in a bit role as the girl behind the checkroom counter in the nightclub scene and BOBBY BLAKE as a little boy who confronts Margaret . Another future child star , little BOBBY DRISCOLL , makes a brief appearance as the boy on the train playing with his toy train . Summing up : O'Brien fans will like this one .
445909	1048771	44926	6.0	John Huston's tribute to the artist is poster art but downbeat . . .	John Huston's portrait of Henri Toulouse-Lautrec is vivid , colorful and energetic when it shows the dance hall can-can atmosphere but lacks substance as a biography when it deals with the painter's personal life in detail . However , JOSE FERRER does splendidly as the crippled artist and others around him give individually fine performances . The cinematography cannot be faulted , capturing the essence of the painter's art as closely as any poster art could do - - and the film seems authentically immersed in period atmosphere and background . But the story is a sluggish one with a downbeat ending that concludes with the artist's death and despair - - nothing uplifting about it - - and the somber tones of the film are reflected in the sometimes low-key photography of interiors . Worthwhile for Ferrer's Oscar-winning performance and a distinguished musical score - - but a bit too downbeat for popular taste .
445427	1048771	67419	6.0	Jacqueline Bisset is the main reason for watching this retread of ' Rosemary's Baby ' . . .	Whatever moral issues exist in this strange tale of the occult , they vanish as soon as you accept the premise of this story - - that a woman would kill another to repossess her husband with both of them in the guise of someone else's body ! ! It's about as weird as any Tales from the Crypt ! On the plus side , all of it is stylishly photographed and played with a certain amount of relish , at least by Jacqueline Bisset , Curt Jurgens and Bradford Dillman . Biggest flaw is casting Alan Alda in the central role as the pianist who inherits the musical talent of Curt Jurgens when the Satanist dies , bequeathing Alda with his body and soul . Bisset is the wife who slowly comes to suspect that her husband has been taken over by someone else . Not quite as strikingly original as " Rosemary's Baby " , it does have some effective horror moments , notably involving scenes with a rather ferocious black dog and a scene where the Devil is summoned but we never actually see him . Imagination is given free reign here ( at least fleetingly ) , shades of Val Lewton . Perhaps a technique that should have been used more often throughout . None of it quite makes sense and the ending is a distinct letdown , but there are some chilling moments nevertheless . Bisset and Parkins are beautifully photographed , with Bisset coming out ahead in the acting department , playing the stressed out wife with appropriate fear and tension . Parkins , on the other hand , seems to rely on one frozen expression , sleepwalking through her role , relying solely on her looks to get by in a way that Hedy Lamarr was often accused of doing in films of the ' 40s . As for Alan Alda , he is much too bland , lending neither interest nor credibility to a role that demands a strong romantic lead . His career suggests that he is clearly more comfortable in character roles requiring comic flair , not straight dramatic parts . Bradford Dillman is at least a stronger presence in a lesser role . All in all , not bad for watching when you're in the mood for a tale of the occult . I seem to recall enjoying the book years ago and the film doesn't quite measure up . It emerges as one of those films that could have been much more satisfying with better casting and direction .
446390	1048771	64471	6.0	The title tells it all . . . fun at the expense of some tired tourists . . .	If nothing else , IF IT'S TUESDAY , THIS MUST BE BELGIUM serves as a nice travelogue for any armchair traveler to enjoy with a glass of wine ( or beer , if that's your taste ! ) It's a funny , uncomplicated look at a bevy of assorted American tourists doing a quick tour of several foreign countries - - and the various humorous situations stemming from just such a tour . Funniest bit has one of them ( Reva Rose ) getting on the wrong tour bus and spending the rest of the film trying to catch up to her husband . SUZANNE PLESHETTE attracts the attention of tour guide IAN McSHANE , so there's love interest going on amid the comical situations . Among the other tourists are MILDRED NATWICK , MURRAY HAMILTON and PEGGY CASS . It's all in good fun and entertaining enough whether you've been on such a trip or not . Trivia note : The N . Y . Times noted that it was appropriate for this one to wind up at Radio City Music Hall during the height of the summer season , since that's where most tired tourists went to see a show in New York .
447626	1048771	16655	6.0	Strange tale permits Chaney to give memorable performance . . .	If it weren't for the acting technique of LON CHANEY , here deceiving others by assuming a dual role , THE BLACKBIRD would be a lot less interesting to discuss . The plot at first promises to be intriguing , but soon becomes bogged down in a story of petty jealousy between two crooked men for the affections of a pretty girl . OWEN MOORE is the aristocratic looking gentleman thief in love with RENEE ADOREE , as is Chaney . One of the film's saving graces are the close-ups of Chaney glowering at Moore when he realizes he's winning the heart of the girl that both of them love . Chaney uses all of his facial mannerisms in a way that makes the screen titles almost unnecessary since he tells everything with his eyes and his body movements . But the thin plot is the culprit here . Many scenes drag on too long without sufficient reason to and the plot is ultimately a weak one by any standards . Todd Browning does get a terrific performance from Chaney , though , and that's the chief reason for watching in the first place . The tawdry atmosphere of the Limehouse London scenes is effective but the story's ending is a weakness . Summing up : Highly watchable for Chaney alone .
445339	1048771	35941	6.0	Enjoyable entry in the Gildersleeve series . . .	This time it's jury duty for The Great Gildersleeve and he's chosen as foreman in GILDERSLEEVE'S BAD DAY . Harold Peary uses his radio characterization of the foolish man to great effect , making the most of a script that puts him into amusing but absurd situations , very few of which have anything to do with reality . He's the lone holdout finding a man " not guilty " of a murder rap when all the evidence proves that he is indeed guilty . DOUGLAS FOWLEY is the criminal whose friends send Gildersleeve a note threatening the worst unless he votes not guilty . Gildy never receives the note and when he does vote " not guilty " , Leroy and Aunt Emma and the rest of his gang figure he's cheating the law . A lot of misunderstandings occur , in goofy fashion , before he gets things straightened out with Judge Hooker . Highly amusing entry if you can forgive the lack of logic , good for a few laughs with another amusing turn from HAROLD PEARY in the title role and JANE DARWELL , NANCY GATES , CHARLES ARNT and FREDDIE MERCER repeating their supporting cast roles in the first Gildersleeve film .
447665	1048771	214904	6.0	A brief look behind the scenes . . .	Apparently Warner Bros . went all out to promote its ANTHONY ADVERSE which was one of their most lavish historical romances back in 1936 . A few details about sets and costumes and some nice glimpses of actresses Olivia de Havilland and Gale Sondergaard talking about their experience of making the film . Both actresses speak with set miniatures of scenes they are in being on display . Miss de Havilland is a picture of radiant beauty , costumed in her role as Angela , and already exhibiting the kind of charm and poise that would make her one of the studio's most bankable stars . Very few scenes from the film are actually shown , but this was a warm-up for the kind of behind the scenes documentaries that would soon become very popular .
446850	1048771	20572	6.0	Transitional silent / sound Lloyd film is semi-successful overlong comedy . . .	Sound technology was new in 1929 - - brand new - - and WELCOME DANGER , originally filmed in silent mode , was re-filmed with sound , the crude sound of the ' 20s which alternates between being loud one moment and soft the next , forcing a constant hand on the volume if you wish to keep track of the painfully banal dialog . HAROLD LLOYD , improbably cast as the son of a police chief who ruled Chinatown , is sent to San Francisco to wipe out crime among the drug lords . Lloyd is a botany student who isn't quite what the force was expecting . The opening scenes with BARBARA KENT are delightfully played for comic situations , but again it's the script that's the real problem . She seems a natural enough actress and Lloyd delivers his lines in OK style , but it's slow going to watch each scene develop - - and most of the comic situations are pretty lame . EDGAR KENNEDY has fun with his role as a desk sergeant who sends Lloyd off on what he thinks is a wild goose chase in Chinatown looking for The Dragon . Some of the sight gags are still fun , left-overs from the silent version , but the film has to be considered an uneasy transition between silent and sound that never quite clicks the way Lloyd's silent comedies did . As Osborne said when doing the intro , some of it is " pretty rough " . Summing up : Except for the interesting Chinatown sequence ( which goes on much too long ) , and the slight twist as to the identity of The Dragon , this one is strictly for Harold Lloyd fans who want to see his complete works .
445719	1048771	44419	6.0	Kirk Douglas leads dangerous expedition in Indian territory . . .	If ever a sprawling tale about an expedition up the Missouri river to trade furs begged for Technicolor photography , THE BIG SKY is it . Based on the novel by A . B . Guthrie , it has KIRK DOUGLAS in the lead as the head of the expedition but most of the footage belongs to young DEWEY MARTIN in his first big screen role . Why he never managed to become a more important player in Hollywood remains a mystery to me . Unfortunately , Dudley Nichols ' screenplay is rather episodic and there are many points toward the end of the film where it seems the story is about to end and then there are further scenes . I found none of the narration objectionable ( as others here seem to imply ) , but the structure of the screenplay is awkwardly handled , especially toward the latter part of the film . Another minus point , the night scenes in the woods look as though they were photographed in a studio and not on location which minimizes the sense of danger from Indians and other trappers that the story requires . But most of the exterior daylight scenes are photographed in crisp B & W photography in real outdoor settings which tend to jar against the studio-lit scenes , making them more noticeable . There's plenty of male camaraderie and friendship among the trappers and colorful incidents involving the Indians , so if this kind of western is your thing you'll undoubtedly find it interesting . I watched the 140 minute version on TCM and it was slow going at times . Summing up : Biggest drawback : should definitely have been filmed in breathtaking Technicolor .
447435	1048771	131600	6.0	A picturesque and colorful ode to tulips . . .	Tulips take center stage in this James A . FitzPatrick Traveltalk short focusing on Holland , the land of tulips . We glimpse a profusion of floral landscapes surrounding various homes in Holland ; a floral parade through the center of town ; scenes of windmills and a variety of tulips , both originating in Holland sometime during the 15th century ; and how it takes five to ten years to cultivate certain bulbs . The colorful landscapes dominate the film which is really a salute to the tulip industries of Holland . Summing up : Well photographed in Technicolor , it's a storybook , picture postcard view of Holland of the sort that invites tourism .
446456	1048771	240511	6.0	Old blue eyes and Nancy carry the hour with favorite tunes . . .	Another FRANK SINATRA show from ' 66 has him opening with FLY ME TO THE MOON and closing with PUT YOUR DREAMS AWAY FOR A LITTLE WHILE . It's a breezy hour show with Sinatra looking as jaunty and comfortable before an audience as he ever did . He seems in a bouncy mood as he goes through a whole slew of his favorite songs , as well as a brief duet sequence with Nancy , who says she'd been in the business for six months when this show aired and already had a couple of Gold platters . His songs include : FLY ME TO THE MOON , THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL IN THE WORLD , MOONLIGHT IN VERMONT and NOBODY TILL SOMEBODY LOVES YOU . Then Nancy came on and sang two of her hits , BANG , BANG HE SHOT ME DOWN and ON Broadway before dad joins her for YES , SIR THAT'S MY BABY and DOWNTOWN . And finally , the two of them join in for her hit song , THESE BOOTS WERE MADE FOR WALKING . Sinatra winds up his segment of the show with IT WAS JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS , MY HEART STOOD STILL , LOVE IS BEAUTIFUL , LUCK BE A LADY ( at his zesty best ) , THAT'S LIFE , GRANADA and CHICAGO . With Nelson Riddle and Gordon Jenkins arrangements , it's a solid show for Sinatra fans to enjoy and a bit of nostalgia too .
446994	1048771	40919	6.0	Amusing , but only up to a point . . . strives to be excruciatingly funny . . .	Preston Sturgess has Rex Harrison emoting at a frantic pace , so much so that the others in the cast seem barely able to keep up with him . Rudy Vallee does , and gives another one of his expert comic performances as Harrison's stuffy brother-in-law who claims to hate music . Barbara Lawrence as his sarcastic wife has a few good one-liners that she tosses at Vallee . And Linda Darnell does a good job of showing slavish devotion to her brilliant conductor husband Harrison . But therein lies the weakness in the premise . Darnell is so obviously devoted ( to the extreme and with extreme patience ) to her temperamental artist of a husband , that it is inconceivable that he would , for one moment , suspect her of infidelity based on hearsay and immediately have her followed by detectives . There are three flashbacks - - with at least one of them being very clever while the others don't quite fit the bill . But the final scene ( back to reality ) is an uneven blend of slapstick and sight gags that simply go on too long before the windup which has him adoring his wife again . Not Sturgess at his best and it's the script that's the main weakness because the acting is fine . Rex Harrison seems to be doing a rehearsal for Henry Higgins and Linda Darnell is charming ( if unbelievably patient ) as the doting wife . Good support from Lionel Stander , Barbara Lawrence and Kurt Kreuger , as well as Edgar Kennedy . Not as excruciatingly funny as it strives to be with a weak finale . A big bonus is the effective use it makes of classical music .
446009	1048771	381434	6.0	Musical Merry-Go-Round # 5 has Frankie Carle and His Orchestra . . .	This is one of the better Musical-Merry-Go Round shorts produced by MGM and featuring Martin Bloch introducing various bands and their best numbers . # 5 features Martin introducing nimble pianist and composer / orchestra leader Frankie Carle opening with " Sweet and Lovely , " with Carle at the piano and the orchestra behind him . We meet his daughter , Marjorie Hughes , singing the ballad , and explaining to Bloch that she grew up in a musical household and sang with the band for a couple of years . Carle is featured again on a number called " Sleepy Time Gal " with some male singers . Marjorie sings an original Carle composition , " Oh , What It Seemed To Be " and then the short concludes with Carle's nimble fingered piano version of his own song , " Sunrise Boogie . " Well done and one of the most enjoyable musical shorts I've seen in a long time .
445488	1048771	56085	6.0	Ambitious western aims high but falls far short of goal . . .	Of course , the best way to view HOW THE WEST WAS WON is seeing it in all its splendor on a big theater screen as intended . My review is based on the full screen presentation on AMC , but it's obvious that the film had to be much more effective as a theatrical offering . First , the flaws : A boring narration by SPENCER TRACY is delivered in dull style by the actor and works against the material . The story itself tries to cram so much western history into the tale that it becomes a series of choppy vignettes that are only able to hint at all the pioneering spirit that went into the making of the American West . Furthermore , by putting DEBBIE REYNOLDS at the center of the piece only emphasizes the superficial aspect of some of the casting choices . Reynolds is so modern in behavior that she makes it hard to see her as a pioneer woman , but more like an MGM musical comedy actress who was stretching herself to play more serious roles . The bouncy musical score helps considerably in boosting the story values and is one of the more enjoyable aspects of watching the film . The performances that linger in the memory once the dust has settled are given by GEORGE PEPPARD , CARROLL BAKER , LEE J . COBB , ROBERT PRESTON and ELI WALLACH . Some less distinguished work by GREGORY PECK and HENRY FONDA fades into the background . Even JOHN WAYNE as General Sherman and HARRY MORGAN as Ulysses S . Grant fail to make much of an impression in brief cameos . The Civil War sequence was most impressive , with Baker and Peppard as mother and son before the conflict giving genuinely moving performances , she as an embittered mother resigned to losing her son to war and he as a naive farmboy anxious to join the fight . The liveliest and best staged sequence is the railroad attack that climaxes the film with some stunning camera-work of runaway trains and perilous stunts that grip the attention . The tacked on corny ending with Reynolds lifting her voice in song seems jarring after the realism of the action scene , symptomatic of the entire film which seems to be an uneven combination of sentimental corn and rousing action or battle scenes . Summing up : Episodic way of viewing history from Hollywood standpoint , but rugged western does have some stirring moments .
446161	1048771	346491	6.0	Battle fatigue after three hours of heavy conflict . . .	Alexander is an ambitious project , whatever one may think of its shortcomings . The script has a hard time pinpointing what makes the great man tick - - and it's certainly muddled when it comes to all the conspiracy theories surrounding his youth and manhood . His mother is played by Angelina Jolie as a conniving temptress with an uncanny control over snakes - - a control she has over him as well , urging him to become the great leader in battles . Colin Farrell does the best he can with the florid dialog , full of pomposity and Shakespearean grandeur , but it's not a part that he really embodies with any great conviction . He does a workmanlike job but never really becomes the character . Nor is his relationship with his lover ( Jared Leto ) ever given more of a hint than intense glances can convey , as if Oliver Stone was reluctant to let the homophobic aspects of Alexander's life interfere with the storytelling . The battle scenes are realistic but fatiguing after awhile , following the accepted strategy of other action films by interspersing fierce battles with the quieter moments - - but never too quiet since most of the dialog consists of arguments between Alexander and his army of dedicated fighters . Val Killmer gives a vigorous performance as his father Michael , almost unrecognizable in his one-eyed make-up and red beard . Anthony Hopkins serves as a one man Greek chorus , narrating the tale in the manner of a bad DVD commentary . Christopher Plummer does a nice job as Aristotle , teaching the Greek youths about their mission in life . On the plus side , the background score by Vangelis is strikingly effective , as is Rodrigo Prieto's gorgeous cinematography . The look of the film is one of its strongest assets with authentic detail in costumes and settings . But the script is a yawner , going back and forth in time to fill in gaps that were intended to fill the viewer in on some missing points . It's a technique that tries the patience several times throughout the lengthy running time . This should find favor with a very limited audience of history buffs .
447151	1048771	35262	7.0	Zany fun , pure old-fashioned escapism with a string of gags for good measure . . .	This is a typical ROAD movie with the boys chasing Lamour as the audience waits to see who Dotty will wind up with . The script is pure escapist , light-hearted stuff and everyone seems to enjoy the tongue in cheek style of all the gags . Bing is his usual affable self , tossing off a few songs in the Crosby manner - - the best of which is " Moonlight Becomes You " . Dorothy Lamour is at her peak of lush beauty as the princess and manages to keep a straight face while the boys cut capers . Bob Hope shines in a part totally suited to his comic skills with one-liners and double takes that keep the high spirits flowing . If you're a fan of ROAD movies , you'll definitely enjoy this one - - although my own personal favorite is still ROAD TO UTOPIA .
448016	1048771	30637	7.0	British version of Shaw play is concise and terrific . . .	There can be no doubt that LESLIE HOWARD was the perfect actor to play Henry Higgins in Shaw's PYGMALION - - although when watching it one can't help hearing Rex Harrison behind some of the lines , so ingrained is the Harrison performance on this particular role . But Howard shows the flair for comedy that he demonstrated in other films of the ' 30s , most notably a screwball comedy with Bette Davis and Olivia de Havilland called " It's Love I'm After " in which Howard and Eric Blore stole the film with their riotous performances . Here he excels as Higgins and with a wonderful Eliza in the form of WENDY HILLER , the two of them make you forget there ever was a musical version - - well , almost . Every time they mention " the rain in Spain " or other Shaw phrases that were turned into musical phrases , you can envision the musical behind the play . SCOTT SUNDERLAND is a delightfully aristocratic Col . Pickering and WILFRID LAWSON is impressive as Alfred Doolittle , each making the role their own in a way that rivals the broader playing of the roles in the musical version directed by George Cukor . What's nice about this MY FAIR LADY is that it isn't overstuffed to the point where it takes more than two hours to tell the tale . It's performed in a brisk one hour and thirty-six minutes without any dull spots . WENDY HILLER is remarkable as Eliza , making the transformation from ignorant Cockney flower girl to a glittering lady with the right amount of poise and charm . She isn't as glamorized as Audrey Hepburn for the ball scene , but still manages to convey the elegance that classifies her as a princess to the elite ladies and gentlemen at the ballroom . If you look closely , you can spot a youthful LEO GENN as the prince who dances with Eliza while the onlookers stare . He hasn't a line of dialog . Well done , smoothly directed by Anthony Asquith , it's a pleasure to watch .
447207	1048771	21884	7.0	James Whales ' creation is still a spine-tingler . . .	The moment COLIN CLIVE speaks that immortal line : " It's alive ! It's alive ! " you get the kind of chill that makes watching FRANKENSTEIN such fun . Atmospherically , it ranks with the best of the old B & W Universal horror films , although today , watching it produces rather distracting visions of what Gene Wilder and Mel Brooks did with YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN , adhering to all the traditions of this early version of the tale . And , of course , with a lot of humor that is missing in this grim take on the story . It's Clive and DWIGHT FRYE as his helper , Fritz , that really give two of the film's most memorable performances . The secondary roles played by JOHN BOLES and MAE CLARKE make no particular impression and are merely standard stock parts . EDWARD VAN SLOAN as Dr . Waldman is effective in a lesser role . And , of course , BORIS KARLOFF is truly magnificent as the creature who , indeed , looks as though he's made from dead body parts . Even the haunted expression on his face is enough to chill . He uses his whole body to express anguish and emotion - - including his arms , his hands , and his walk . All of his mad rages are extremely well handled by the consummate actor . Karloff manages to bring sympathy and pity for the creature , despite his many manic moments . The suspense builds when he escapes from his confines and all of these climactic scenes still have the power to enthrall , as he strolls through the countryside and terrifies the villagers . The scene by the water with the little girl who befriends him is particularly touching . Summing up : Still chilling after all these years thanks to masterful direction by James Whale , great sets and fine cinematography . Well worth treasuring for preserving BORIS KARLOFF's memorable role .
446971	1048771	368658	7.0	Enjoyed it much more than " Shakespeare in Love " . . .	17th Century period films done by the British are always so impeccably cast and acted that you're taken back to that time when actors played all the roles ( including the female leads ) and women were forbidden to trod the boards . All this changed when King Charles II ( RUPERT EVERETT in too brief a role ) decided it was time for reformation . At least , that's the way it goes in STAGE BEAUTY starring CLAIRE DANES as the lovely woman determined to become an actress and BILLY CRUDUP as the male actor playing women's roles who becomes jealous of the woman who happens to be his dresser . Sumptuously costumed and with authentic looking interiors and exteriors , it's played in the grand manner by a cast of excellent players , including TOM WILKINSON , JAMES FOX , BEN CHAPLIN and HUGH BONNEVILLE , all of whom nail their roles beautifully . But it's BILLY CRUDUP who has to carry much of the film with his impassioned performance as the young man who must adjust to playing a man's role when he finally plays Othello to Danes ' Desdemona and the two of them triumph in the tragedy when they capture the attention of the audience with an ultra-realistic scene where Desdemona gets brutal treatment from the Moor . Frankly , I enjoyed this much more than the similarly themed Shakespeare IN LOVE with the dismal playing of GWYNETH PALTROW masquerading as a boy . This should be of special interest to anyone with a background in theater who wants to see how theatrical shows were managed and performed in " ye olde days " . Summing up : Highly entertaining with an ensemble cast at their peak .
445956	1048771	66344	7.0	" Thank you very much " Albert Finney and company . . .	Purists won't be too happy with whatever omissions were made in the Dickens tale to include some harmless songs by Leslie Bricusse , but ALBERT FINNEY ( in age make-up ) hams it up with a sense of humor as Scrooge - - and with a cast including EDITH EVANS , KENNETH MORE and ALEC GUINNESS ( as Marley's Ghost ) , you can't go too far wrong . The atmosphere is good , the color cinematography captures merry old England in all its Victorian splendor , and the songs are brisk and somewhat charming in all their simplicity . Especially winning are " Thank You Very Much " and " I Love Life " ( sung by an exuberant Finney after his reformation ) . This one is certain to please the kids who want to see another version of the timeless tale of redemption on Christmas Day . Summing up : Harmless fun for all is sure to put some glow into your Christmas .
445351	1048771	60934	7.0	Steve McQueen remains the focal point in ambitious , sometimes rambling film . . .	STEVE McQUEEN makes a completely believable machinist's mate aboard a U . S . Navy gunboat who finds himself enmeshed in the politics of unrest that existed in 1926 China during the period of the Boxer Rebellion . It's probably one of the finest roles of his career - - honest , vexating , and completely true to the emotions of his character whose only real concern is taking care of his engines . There are plenty of other good performances . RICHARD CRENNA is the Captain , uncertain of just how the U . S . / Chinese friction should be solved , and CANDACE BERGEN is lovely as a missionary who has a tender romance with McQueen . The exotic locales ( it was filmed mostly in Taiwan ) , the lush background score by Jerry Goldsmith , and the confrontation between the U . S . Navy and the Chinese authorities which supplies the necessary suspense before an action-filled climax , all serve to make THE SAND PEBBLES a fascinating look at a period in history that is seldom explored . And , of course , it raises questions as to our role in imperialism and our interaction with the culture of foreign countries that make the film relevant today . It's a long film , rather uneven in places , but directed with rare sensitivity by Robert Wise and richly detailed period atmosphere .
446461	1048771	30440	7.0	Preparation for " Pinocchio " evident in underwater scenes . . .	Disney was busy trying to lift the art of animation to new heights by having his artists do an " under the sea " type of thing , long before anyone would be seeing films like PINOCCHIO or THE LITTLE MERMAID . MERBABIES is thin on plot but the art work is gorgeous and the visual elements are what make it worth watching . A dazzling array of sea creatures are having a circus-like parade that includes a number of sight gags with the creatures taking on the looks of elephants , donkeys , horses and other animals . Finally , just when the atmosphere couldn't be any cheerier , everyone scatters at the approach of a hard breathing whale ( as in PINOCCHIO ) . The merbabies ride to the surface surrounded by a sea of bubbles and emerge atop the water , safe from the monstrous whale . Easy to see that Disney was doing experimental procedures for PINOCCHIO before its release two years later . Visually stunning , if a bit too cute for some tastes . All of the art work is first rate and much more impressive than in the earlier Disney shorts from ' 33 and onward .
445565	1048771	105236	7.0	Graphic crime film from Tarantino . . .	It took me fifteen years to get around to viewing RESERVOIR DOGS and my interest was piqued only because I've come to admire HARVEY KEITEL as an actor . And I might as well admit , I'm not a fan of Quentin Tarantino either , although I love a good crime film . This one has to do with tough gang members talking about the aftermath of a crime , where one of them is seriously wounded and they suspect someone has infiltrated their mob and tipped off the police . " Did you kill anybody ? " " Three cops . No real people , just cops . " The brutal torture scene was a little too intense for me . But the story , about the cop inserting himself into the mob , is well handled throughout , building tension from scene to scene even though the flashbacks are not in chronological order . Standout performances from the entire cast : HARVEY KEITEL , TIM ROTH , MICHAEL MADSEN , CHRIS PENN , QUENTIN Tarantino and LAWRENCE TIERNEY ( almost unrecognizable as the Lawerence Tierney of " Dillinger " and other ' 40s crime films ) . Warning : As usual with Tarantino , the graphic violence is a bit much with lots of kicking , stabbing , blood gushing moments - - and the torture scene of a young cop is almost unwatchable in its intensity and cruelty . But all in all , a powerful film of its kind with a " crime doesn't pay " morality tacked onto the brutal ending . If only Tarantino could tell his tales with a little more finesse - - but then , he wouldn't be Tarantino , would he ? Warning : Not for children . Too intense , too graphic . Seen now , it's almost a forerunner of Martin Scorsese's THE DEPARTED with the same gangster brutality and the dialog peppered with profanity in practically every other word .
445566	1048771	83806	7.0	Twist upon twist makes an absorbing mystery even better . . .	Nothing's more enjoyable for me than a who-dun-it or suspense tale that keeps you guessing throughout as to how the whole thing will end . And that's precisely what happens in DEATHTRAP , based on a chilling play by Ira Levin ( " Rosemary's Baby " ) . And in it , MICHAEL CAINE and CHRISTOPHER REEVE get to do the kind of stunt that Caine and Laurence Olivier pulled off in SLEUTH - - with just about as much skill and as many puzzles as ever existed in that extraordinarily clever play . But because it's meant to scare you , surprise you , and keep you guessing as to the outcome , it's difficult to write a review about the plot . Let's just say that what we know in the beginning is all you have to know about the film for the present . MICHAEL CAINE is an insanely jealous playwright whose latest play has failed miserably . When a young aspiring writer CHRISTOPHER REEVE sends him the manuscript of his play , Caine realizes that passing it off as his own would solve all his problems and get his reputation back . From that point on , it's a matter of fun and games for the audience as Ira Levin's story unwinds , managing to trump Agatha Christie for the number of twists . Caine and Reeve play off each other brilliantly , each bringing a certain dynamic tension to the tale as well as some humorous touches that come from a script that laces drama with humor . Summing up : Well worth seeing - - but not everyone is pleased with the ending .
445405	1048771	39251	7.0	A cat concerto like no other . . .	You'll never listen to Hungarian Rhapsody No . 2 again without thinking of this classic MGM cartoon with Tom in concert mode performing at the Hollywood Bowl in formal attire while Jerry is asleep inside the piano . That is , until the performance begins . Then , as the music becomes more and more vigorous , Jerry adds his own special touch to the performance , much to the exasperation of Tom . Although the two of them are sparring throughout , they never miss a note of music - - which is the real bonus for music lovers who may wish to just sit back and listen to the music without visuals . Enormously clever and deserving of the Oscar it won in 1947 . It's the sort of cartoon that reminds us all of how beautifully the Disney people used music in all of their full-length features , probably an encouragement for the Hanna Barbera people to use it for so many of their cartoon classics .
446342	1048771	18054	7.0	Early De Mille epic is reverent , ambitious , artistic presentation . . .	The silent factor doesn't hurt THE KING OF KINGS . As seen on TCM with an appropriate background score and all of the two-strip Technicolor scenes intact , it's stunning visually and impressive from beginning to end . Of course , some of the acting belongs strictly to the silent period but overall the performances are right on target . H . B . WARNER is touching as Jesus , but Joseph SCHILDKRAUT is the standout in the cast , portraying Judas with great skill and conviction . ERNEST TORRENCE as Peter is effective too . DOROTHY CUMMING as Mary does a sympathetic job and VICTOR VARCONI makes an impressive Pontious Pilate . JACQUELINE LOGAN makes a vivid impression as Mary Magdelene . Child actor MICHAEL D . MOORE is excellent as Mark . The sets and costumes are opulent , as one expects in a De Mille epic , and the story is told at an even pace that belies the fact that it's extremely lengthy for a silent film of this period . TCM showed the full version . While the director took liberties with Biblical text to create a vivid cinematic work , it faithfully follows all of the main threads of the greatest story ever told . The film is enhanced by the silent factor since it does allow the viewer to use his imagination when it comes to the voice of Jesus . Summing up : Must rank among the great silent films - - well worth viewing . Trivia note : Interesting to spot WILLIAM BOYD ( Hopalong Cassidy ) as Simon of Cyrene who helps Jesus carry the cross . He's very effective .
447331	1048771	26056	7.0	Fred MacMurray almost steals the spotlight . . .	ALICE ADAMS is the film I'd heard about for years as one of Hepburn's best early films so when I had the chance to watch it recently on TCM I took advantage of it . From a novel by Booth Tarkington , it concerns a young woman anxious to connect socially with the right people who manages to attract the attention of a handsome and well-to-do young man ( Fred MacMurray ) at a party . Hepburn shines in the title role , looking fresh and attractive , struggling to keep him interested in her - - but unfortunately , with all of her trademark mannerisms not always held in check . She does well in the role but , in my opinion , the real magnet of interest is the under-appreciated Fred MacMurray who does a sincere and effortless job as her suitor in a role that could not have been easy to bring off . Both stars are in their physical prime , but MacMurray's naturalness only makes Hepburn look even more mannered than usual . Fortunately , this works because her character is supposed to be putting on airs . But at times , this is overdone . The awkwardness of the social situations are exploited - - and the highpoint has to be the warm dinner served on a hot evening , complete with maid service ( by Hattie McDaniel ) in one of the movie's most amusing , if uncomfortable , scenes . Here too , MacMurray displays just the right amount of stability against all odds . Fred Stone provides a number of chuckles as Hepburn's so provincial father . All of the supporting roles are nicely filled , with special praise for Ann Shoemaker as the concerned mother anxious for her daughter to find the right suitor . But it's Hepburn's showcase under George Stevens ' sensitive direction and she is convincing despite the overly mannered performance . Summing up : Although some of the situations seemed a bit forced and not everyone will appreciate the humor at Hattie McDaniel's expense , it's worth watching for Hepburn and MacMurray alone .
446198	1048771	43132	7.0	It's no " Laura " but it's good , gritty film noir . . .	WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS deserves to be a better known film directed by Otto Preminger , the man who gave the world LAURA . And this time , he's got the same co-stars : DANA ANDREWS and GENE TIERNEY . It must be said that Tierney here is under-used in what amounts to more of a supporting role while the spotlight goes to Andrews . He plays a tough , hardened cop used to dealing with a bunch of thugs in too vigorous a way until one night he accidentally kills a man in the process of arresting him . When suspicion falls on a cab driver ( TOM TULLY ) , he goes along with the investigation into the murder but starts to feel guilt because he's in love with the cabbie's daughter ( GENE TIERNEY ) . Tierney , by the way , looks a little too elegant for the girl she's playing here and doesn't seem to fit into the squalid background elements of the story . The story takes a grim turn as the investigation goes deeper and it's discovered that the murdered man had a silver plate in his head from his service as a war hero . By the end , it turns into a morality tale with Andrews developing a conscience over his crime . It's fascinating as film noir with capable performances from a strong supporting cast . A good entry in the field of noir , forcefully directed by Preminger and nicely played by Andrews and Tierney , despite the slight miscasting of her character .
446580	1048771	40087	7.0	Edward G . Robinson in another powerhouse performance . . .	ALL MY SONS may have been slightly diluted for the screen as compared to the stage play which implicated corruption and wartime profiteering on a higher level than just one or two business men , but it's still powerful stuff and extremely well directed by Irving Reis . Individual scenes have a strength that is impressive , largely due to the excellent central performances of BURT LANCASTER , EDWARD G . ROBINSON and MADY CHRISTIANS . Robinson , in particular , makes the most of a meaty role that has him cocky and confident one moment , then bruised and bitter the next as his past crimes catch up with him - - and his conscience . Seems that during WWII , he and his partner ( FRANK CONROY ) were pressured to finish making cylinder parts for airplanes on the government's tight schedule and knowingly sent defective parts which caused the death of twenty-one pilots when their planes went down . Robinson has been hiding the truth from himself and his neighbors ever since , concerned only with making a decent living for himself and his family in suburban America . Conflicts arise when others around him begin to question his role in the crime that sent his partner to jail . The son of the jailed partner , played in rather stiff fashion by HOWARD DUFF , is unforgiving when he realizes Robinson shared the guilt with his father and yet let his father take the blame for the incident . Lancaster , too , and his girlfriend ( LOUISA HORTON ) who happens to be Duff's sister , also bring the conflicts into the open when they start asking for answers and probing for the truth . Horton is rather colorless in what is meant to be a sympathetic role and spent her remaining years in TV roles . But it's EDWARD G . ROBINSON who makes the biggest impression as the father , proud of his achievements and obviously in denial until his son , Lancaster , makes him realize why his other son never returned from the war - - which leads to a tragic ending . Summing up : Somber drama never quite overcomes its stage origins but it's still powerful stuff . Trivia note : The only implausible factor in the casting - - the physical impossibility of BURT LANCASTER as Robinson's son , when he bears no physical resemblance whatsoever to Eddie - - nor Mady Christians for that matter !
445839	1048771	443706	7.0	Suspenseful thriller is based on true , unsolved case . . . excellent performances . . .	ZODIAC starts off with a bang , and then gets so bogged down in intense detective work that the thriller aspect is diluted by the time the first hour is over . Furthermore , since the case was never really solved , there's no real payoff at the end - - just more speculation . Despite this , it manages to hold the attention for well over two hours with a tale that zig-zags back and forth between a newspaper ( The San Francisco Chronicle ) , its crime reporter ( ROBERT DOWNEY , JR . ) and cartoonist ( JAKE GYLLENHAAL ) , and the police force with MARK RUFFALO as the lead detective on the case and his partner ( ANTHONY EDWARDS ) both committed to finding the Zodiac killer . The clever murderer keeps the police at bay over a period of years and still they try to uncover each clue and spend a great deal of time working on the unsolved murders that eventually claim some thirteen lives . The first murders are staged brilliantly by director David Fincher , and the film becomes a gripping search for the sadistic killer . But after the murder of a taxicab driver , the film veers into detective work with a penchant for detail that soon becomes bogged down in too much exposition . JAKE GYLLENHAAL is excellent as the boyishly enthusiastic cartoonist who soon becomes obsessed by the case . He's the one who eventually wrote two books on the subject . His scariest moment comes toward the end of the film when he's invited to the home of an acquaintance of the killer hoping to glean some important information . His fear and horror that the man might be the killer himself almost makes up for the fact that the story has no real solution . It's a brilliantly staged scene with his panic attack never overplayed . The other performances are uniformly good , but it's Gyllenhaal who does the most convincing job in the central role . Sad to see DERMOT MULRONEY wasted in the small role of a police captain . Summing up : Suspenseful and well directed , but loses some momentum when it shifts from the horrific murders to the relentless detective work .
445328	1048771	67482	7.0	Very funny , cleverly written story gives Matthau and May great roles . . .	A NEW LEAF is so consistently side-splittingly funny that it always puzzles me that Elaine May sought an injunction from Paramount when they released the film and it opened at Radio City Music Hall . She was fighting them to take her name off the film up until the last minute because she said it was not her version . Well , I never did see the Director's Cut of this movie , but I can tell you that A NEW LEAF is one of the funniest films of its kind I've ever seen in a memory that goes back to Charlie Chaplan's 1947 masterpiece , MONSIEUR VERDOUX about a serial murderer of rich wives . If Miss May's version seems more like a series of TV blackout sketches , that may be due to the fact that she and Mike Nichols wrote some of the best comedy sketches to ever appear in that medium . Here the joke is extended for an hour and forty-two minutes as Matthau attempts to find a suitably rich wife that will enable him to resume his life as a wealthy man - - without her . It's so full of wonderful comic moments involving him and the clumsy , near-sighted botanist ( Elaine May ) who falls deeply in love with him and , in the end , makes him a better man . Their scenes together are matchless for pure comedy technique with every line uttered with such complete mastery of the art . Summing up : A barrel of laughs .
446587	1048771	482571	7.0	Dark tale of magician rivalry takes many twists and turns . . .	Perhaps there is such a thing as a story taking too many twists and turns , and not all of them credible . That's the major fault of THE PRESTIGE which pits two very ambitious magicians ( HUGH JACKMAN and Christian BALE ) against each other in a manner that hasn't been seen on the screen since Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine played dirty tricks on each other in SLEUTH . But there are other compensations in THE PRESTIGE to make it a worthwhile viewing experience for the serious movie-goer . It captures the look and feel of Victorian England with its beautifully detailed sets , artfully low-key in lighting but teaming with vitality and authentic looking period decor . Then too , the performances are all at a perfect pitch to make it an ensemble cast of acting pros doing their best to keep you guessing until the final shot . MICHAEL CAINE is wonderful in a colorful supporting role as the man who devises some of the ingenious stunts and SCARLETT JOHANSSON makes the most of a rather brief supporting role as a traitorous magician's assistant . And as the scientist who leaves Jackman with one of his most inspired tricks , David BOWIE is excellent as Tesla . But the last fifteen minutes are shrouded in such mystery and some highly doubtful explanations that the conclusion comes as a bit of a letdown after all the build-up to what the viewer can only hope will be a plausible ending . Christopher Nolan does much better with this than he did with MEMENTO , even though the tricky story structure is again likely to add confusion to all the entertaining twists and turns that occur on a regular basis . But overall , it's a very entertaining and puzzling piece of work with sleight of hand magic at every turn .
446653	1048771	39017	8.0	Clever , brisk and thoroughly entertaining . . .	There's not a second of screen time wasted in telling the tale of the Star of Rhodesia diamond that is stolen aboard an express train - - and , of course , Sherlock Holmes , Dr . Watson and Insepctor LeStrade are all aboard the train , having been advised that someone is going to make an attempt to steal it . This low-budget Universal entry is easily one of the best of the Universal features co-starring BASIL RATHBONE and NIGEL BRUCE . Bruce is especially funny as he decides to do some investigating himself , with amusing false clues leading him astray . Rathbone is completely suave and relaxed as Holmes , less snappy than usual in the way he treats Watson and much more likable in the role than he has been in other entries . The plot abounds with the usual assortment of suspicious characters , but of all the supporting players ALAN MOBRAY is the one who stands out as the man who befriends Watson . Despite the low-budget trimmings and overuse of miniatures to show a train racing through the fog at night , the story is taut and the whole affair is intriguing enough to keep you watching until the unusual ending - - where a double twist is completely unexpected . Highly enjoyable Holmes adventure , well-paced and entertaining .
447322	1048771	35169	8.0	Zany fun . . . overflowing with Sturges madness !	THE PALM BEACH STORY is not to be confused with reality . It's a zany romantic comedy given full speed treatment by director Preston Sturges who brought screwball comedy to an art form . His script , full of hilarious one-liners that fly by almost too fast to catch , is acted to perfection by CLAUDETTE COLBERT , RUDY VALLEE and MARY ASTOR - - with a less enthusiastic turn by JOEL McCREA who gives the only so-so performance , perhaps because none of the wittiest lines come his way . I've always liked this actor but here is performance is almost muted and strangely remote . Nevertheless , if screwball comedy is your dish , this is one you can relish . From the moment Colbert gets aboard a train carrying her to Palm Beach , the fun starts and gets into high gear , racing toward a conclusion that is not altogether satisfying nor even remotely hinted at until the final few minutes of film . It's a twist that somehow doesn't ring true - - the only really false note in an otherwise perfect screwball comedy . Rudy Vallee is outstanding as a nutty millionaire , a role written expressly for him ( and he even gets to sing a little ) - - and Mary Astor , as his husband hunting sister , is hilariously over the top as a woman who can't stop talking while pursuing her man . A good way to spend a pleasant 90 minutes .
447496	1048771	66473	8.0	A bit overlong in getting to the big battle . . . but worth the wait . . .	Detailing the events leading up to the infamous Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor , December 7 , 1941 - - and telling the story from both the Japanese and American point of view - - TORA ! TORA ! TORA ! is most effective when it gets to the day of battle which begins with the Japanese pilots getting into their planes and culminates in the extremely realistic depiction of the actual bombing . The film is faulty in getting us to that point , as it weaves back and forth between Hawaii and Washington , depicting Japanese and American behind-the-scenes intrigue , and in an objective way telling the complete story of the mistakes , big and small on both sides , that led the U . S . into World War II . Whether there are inaccuracies in the telling , for dramatic purposes , I'm not sure - - but it does seem to be even handed in its treatment of events . Although the cast is an impressive one , there are no single performances that stay in the mind . Instead , the viewer is aware of the vast scope of the story and the series of events that took place just before that fateful day - - which is as it should be . The Japanese segments held more fascination for me than the American sequences , for some reason . The pacing of the first two-thirds of the story is on the slow side . Not until the last forty-five minutes does the film come to life with an absolute sense of realism in its display of the bombing raid both from the air and on the ground . Technically , the film is a superb example of ' 70s film-making . All of the battle scenes are extremely well done for maximum effect . Yamamoto's final words serve as a chilling reminder , the kind of remark that still holds true in today's world where the U . S . is fighting a war against terrorism which , hopefully , has aroused " the sleeping giant " ( the U . S . ) to the extent that we will eventually triumph over our enemies who want to kill us as we were the victors over Japan . As a history lesson , this is a very valuable film indeed .
447663	1048771	34862	8.0	Fred's Firecracker Dance Steals the Show ! ! . . .	What more can be said about a movie that's become a perennial Christmas favorite featuring a whole slew of Irving Berlin song and dance routines , and two of the most popular and talented stars of film musicals - - BING CROSBY and FRED ASTAIRE at their best . Well , it's a light , airy , briskly entertaining sort of musical that deserves its immense popularity due mainly to the unforgettable Berlin songs that are sprinkled throughout : " White Christmas " , " Easter Parade " , " Happy Holidays " and " Be Careful , It's My Heart " , among a roster of other delights that more than make up for a thin storyline . And Fred Astaire , in his prime , is a dancer to be reckoned with when he taps his way through the perfectly timed firecracker dance for The Fourth of July sequence . That amazing solo dance , thanks to a pocketful of firecrackers , is alone worth waiting for . Wartime audiences back in 1942 hungered for this kind of innocent fun and laughter - - as well as all of the nostalgic , cozy sort of charm induced by having an inviting setting ( a lovely old farmhouse in Connecticut ) serve as the focal piece for the story of two show business men fighting over the same girl . Marjorie Reynolds lends her winsome charm to the female lead and Walter Abel is delightful in a good supporting role . Especially interesting is the way the storyline leads to Hollywood and the movie combines the Christmas stage setting on a studio set ( which is supposed to be an exact replica of the farmhouse ) , as compared to the real thing . And it's there , on that studio set , that the story leads to its inevitable conclusion with the singing of " White Christmas " . Interesting bit of trivia : My personal favorite Best Song nomination that year was " Love Is A Song " , the beautiful main theme of BAMBI , but , of course , it had no chance against Irving Berlin's title tune at the top of all the music charts . Too bad Paramount couldn't afford Technicolor for this one . They were on a budget during the war years and made very few major releases in color .
445550	1048771	60665	8.0	Brilliant cast , director , script . . . memorable Paul Scofield . . .	A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS has Sir Thomas More ( PAUL SCOFIELD ) pitted against Henry VIII ( ROBERT SHAW ) as he struggles with his conscience and religious convictions rather than give in to those who want him to support the King's desire to annul his barren marriage and wed another . He's up against all sorts of devious schemers , two of the most infamous extremely well played by LEO McKERN and JOHN HURT . ROBERT SHAW gives an over-the-top , typically flamboyant performance as Henry VIII that sometimes borders on the ludicrous . Yet , for this performance , he received much acclaim . But PAUL SCOFIELD carries the film with his intelligent , piercing eyes and wit as he spars verbally with every member of his household , including WENDY HILLER as his stubborn wife who wants him to spare himself the indignity of being sent to the Tower . He maintains his poise and quiet determination at all times . The costumes , the sets , the exteriors - - all are brilliantly captured to give the film an authentic feeling of time and atmosphere . The screenplay by Robert Bolt is a pleasure to watch and listen to as it unfolds a period of history right before our eyes . This is the sort of film only the British can do in the royal manner - - and it justifiably won several well deserved Oscars , including one for Scofield as Best Actor and other awards that included Best Picture and Best Director ( FRED ZINNEMANN ) . As a history lesson , you can't afford to miss it .
446740	1048771	385330	8.0	Painting the forest green . . . a great behind the scenes look . . .	The newly restored DVD of THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD contains this documentary giving the viewer a behind the scenes glimpse of what was going on in the Hollywood of 1938 as Warners prepared to make their most expensive film up until then . Rudy Behlmer , Bob Thomas and Robert Osborne do a nice job of explaining the problems of script , casting , photography , change of directors , the previews and the enthusiastic way the film was greeted by critics and public . It was a resounding hit at the famous Radio City Music Hall in New York City when it opened in May of that year . Also interesting are the comments by Hollywood Bowl conductor John Mauceri who tells how interesting it was that Warners had under their studio three of the most famous film composers of that era : Erich Wolfgang Korngold , Max Steiner and Franz Waxman , all at the same time . He goes on to praise the score and explains how doing ROBIN HOOD became a lifesaver for Korngold and his family at a time when the Nazis were taking over his homeland of Austria . He even recites the story behind their escape on the last train leaving Germany before the invasion of Austria . ( Sounds like an echo of The Sound of Music's storyline ) . Fascinating , well researched , full of anecdotes that should fascinate any fan of this glorious film . As for my title comment , " Painting the forest green , " we discover that because the film began shooting in October of ' 37 , much of the forest had begun shifting to autumn colors , requiring the studio to paint some of the shrubbery a shimmering green to give it a summery look . And it worked . . . but any astute observer of the film can notice that in certain scenes there are definite sprinklings of autumn colors among the leaves . Interesting to note the fond friendship Basil Rathbone seemed to have for Olivia de Havilland in all of the candid shots .
447215	1048771	36112	8.0	Quite wonderful , but this blimp is a bit bloated . . .	If you want to see gorgeous Technicolor , lavish sets , fine performances ( ROGER LIVESEY , DEBORAH KERR ( in three roles ) and ANTON WALBROOK , then THE LIFE AND DEATH OF COLONEL BLIMP is your ticket . But beware , it is not a perfect film . It probably appealed much more to British audiences already aware of the famous comic strip " Colonel Blimp " which satirized a military man . Here , the satire has been preserved for a running time of almost three hours , and the film - - despite some marvelous scenes - - suffers from many scenes that should have been edited before the film went into general release . Furthermore , there is a decided British flavor to the whole thing which means that this is the sort of film which I'm sure has a much broader appeal to British audiences than American ones . The plot goes forward in a roundabout way , beginning at the end and then flashing back to the brash , youthful Colonel Candi full of daring , until it closes on the man who has become an anachronism among the military who dismiss his out of date methods during a field exercise and force him to retire . What's so remarkable about the production values are that this was Britain during the war when rationing and shortages of all kinds made film-making a very arduous task . You can detect none of this in the handsome Technicolor settings , even if some of the painted backdrops give a hint of some wartime austerity . Deborah Kerr's close-ups are as lovely as any she ever had during her lengthy career in American films - - but it is the two men , Roger Livesey and Anton Walbrook , who make the most of the meatiest roles . Walbrook has a very moving monologue toward the end of the film ( he's a German officer who reflects on his close ties to Britain and his good friend , the colonel ) , and Livesey gives a fully rounded portrayal ( yes , that's a pun ) of a blustery man that we see develop over a period of forty years from his arrogant youth to his stuffy old age . But the length of the film seems staggering at times - - it doesn't have the energy to move from scene to scene with anything but a snail's pace . This is the chief drawback of an otherwise excellent film .
