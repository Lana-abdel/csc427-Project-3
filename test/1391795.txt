399641	1391795	220506	2.0	Give it a rest , Moustapha Akkad !	After FINALLY , FINALLY dispatching his feisty sister Laurie Strode ( Jamie Lee Curtis , in an obligatory cameo role ) , Michael Myers ( Brad Loree ) hacks and slashes his way through the idiots who have won an opportunity to spend the night in his childhood home . Their whole experience - and eventual slaughter - is broadcast on the worldwide web by entrepreneur Freddie Harris ( Busta Rhymes ) . This is a frustratingly routine and mundane slasher movie and it's sickening to think how the greedy producers of this series will just refuse to let it rest ( a " Halloween 9 " is in the works , but that's hardly a surprise ) . Director Rick Rosenthal , who also directed Part 2 ( and who has a cameo as Professor Mixter ) tries to make it suspenseful but it's all for naught since Myers is no longer scary and it is no longer interesting to watch him kill . The characters are intolerable ( especially Jen ) and I just plain didn't care if they died . The film may be more notable for being one of the most politically correct slasher movies to date , although I couldn't help but be somewhat annoyed to see Myers get roughed up by Freddie . I mean , the character used to be a lot more of a threat . ( By the way , they haven't had a good Michael Myers since the second film . And the masks are looking more and more cartoon-like . ) I'm sorry to say - - - I gave it .
398637	1391795	110189	2.0	Unless you're a fan of these guys , DON'T WATCH .	Real-life comics Johnny Brennan and Kamal ( Ahmed ) , basically playing themselves , are two worthless , lazy chums who seemingly spend all their time making crank phone calls . They get in trouble when they get mixed up with mobsters Lazzaro ( Alan Arkin ) , Tony ( Vincent " Big Py " Pastore ) , and their crew . This flat , lazy , stupid , and boring " comedy " is not worth watching at all unless you like your laughs as immature as possible ( and get off on hearing epithets and expletives ad nauseum ) . I did not find these guys funny at one time during the movie . This movie gets old VERY quickly . Not to mention the fact that the " funny " voices that they use are dopey and unoriginal . No , the only thing worth mentioning about " The Jerky Boys " is the assortment of special appearances : musical performances by Tom Jones and Helmet , and cameo appearances by Ozzy Osbourne ( as Helmet's manager ! ) and Paul Bartel . There are some familiar old character actors in the supporting roles , but they are so poorly used it's sad . What possessed Arkin to appear in this ? Executive produced by Tony Danza and Emilio Estevez !
399009	1391795	116671	3.0	" I only axed you for a smoke ! "	Jack Frost ( Scott MacDonald ) is a prolific serial killer being transported to the electric chair on a snowy night when he comes into contact with a specially designed acid and has his DNA fused into a fall of snow . . . so he dies but comes back as an ugly killer snowman . Confusing this movie with the 1998 Michael Keaton family film of the same name may actually be more amusing than anything in this movie ( although they do admittedly share the same premise : men who die and come back to " life " as snowmen ) . I understand that this silly horror spoof is limited by a low budget , and I can understand that I'm not supposed to take it seriously - the whole movie is very tongue-in-cheek - but for me it still didn't work . I thought that it was rather lame and uninteresting and I didn't think that it was lively enough for me to forgive its other flaws . I think that this was Shannon Elizabeth's movie debut and I think that she should be thankful that better roles and scripts came along for her .
398603	1391795	200469	3.0	Not really worth your time .	Hordes of genetically enhanced killer bats lay siege to a rural Texas area . Bat lover / scientist Sheila Casper ( Dina Meyer of " Starship Troopers " ) and local sheriff Emmett Kimsey ( Lou Diamond Phillips ) , with the help of her assistant Jimmy ( Leon ) work to save the day . That's all that this movie has in the way of plot . A glorified B-movie that at times wallows in lousy dialog and characters ( and performances ) ; it starts stinking like a great steaming pile of guano . Whenever the bats attack it gets a bit more entertaining but this is routine , formula horror stuff that does little more than take up space on the video store shelf . Even the creature effects are below par for the K . N . B . EFX Group ; the bats look somewhat ridiculous at times . In the featurette on the DVD , the actors seem to be trying to convince themselves that they were appearing in something of merit . Well , let me tell you , if this movie had gone more over the top , or gotten more campy , or tongue-in-cheek , or something like that , it might have been more fun ( for me , anyway - at least the stupid lines would have been more tolerable ) , but the film-makers take it seriously as a visceral , make-you-squirm-in-your-seat kind of movie . Once it's over , you'll forget all about it .
398875	1391795	192731	3.0	I've Forgotten It Already .	Yet another gratuitous horror sequel ; this one is set at a film school with various students engaging in cutthroat competition for the Hitchcock award . Is the mad slasher chopping up various victims out to win this award ? Could be . . . This movie does not deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as the name Hitchcock . None of the films-within-the-film , or this film itself , would be leading candidates for ANY sort of award , in my opinion . This is routine film-making with obligatory gore and flawed writing , a gorgeous but underwhelming young cast , and so sense of style or flair . If I were the veterans in this cast ( Hart Bochner , Loretta Devine ) in this film , I would be embarrassed . This is a sequel in name only , with only the smallest possible references to the first film , and not much actual exploitation of the " urban legends " concept . It's watchable , but REALLY forgettable . By the way , doesn't co-star Eva Mendes look like Gina Gershon in this film ? I think so . And , seriously , how lame is a fencer's mask as a disguise ? I guess all the cool disguises in horror films have been exhausted by this point . A note to Hollywood : please , I don't think the world needs another " Urban Legend " movie . Film-making debut for John Ottman , who's worked as a producer , composer AND editor . I would advise him to stick to those other jobs .
399385	1391795	309530	3.0	It was a hard film for me to easily enjoy . . .	Parody of and tribute to Rock Hudson / Doris Day romantic / sex comedies from the 1960's ; this movie tells the story of a celebrated feminist author ( Renee Zellweger ) and the womanizing , superstar columnist ( Ewan McGregor ) who is determined to prove that she is a phony . Well , it's a triumph of 1960's-style production and costume design , if nothing else . One may have to be familiar with the kind of movies that this movie is sending up in order to appreciate it . It didn't really charm me , however - I found it to be pretty annoying and silly throughout and none of the upbeat , likable performances of the primary performers could make enough of a difference . It had me thinking " Oh my God " and rolling my eyes more than once - and that is never a good thing . It's very light and " airy " and is pretty forgettable once it is over . Zellweger has a lengthy monologue about 75 minutes into the movie that pretty much sums up the whole picture ! I guess it could be charitably described as a " personal taste " kind of movie - you will either be charmed by it or as annoyed as I was . At least it had small roles for ' Saturday Night Live ' players Rachel Dratch and Chris Parnell .
399384	1391795	91575	4.0	LeBrun's Law says don't watch . . .	Run-of-the-mill , less than energetic cop vs . psycho movie in which Jack Murphy ( Charles Bronson ) is a grumpy , alcoholic police detective who is framed for the murder of a few people , including his stripper ex-wife . The culprit is Joan Freeman ( Carrie Snodgress ) , a disturbed creep who is motivated by that old standby : revenge . Along the way , Murphy acquires a spunky , unwilling companion in small-time criminal Arabella McGee ( Kathleen Wilhoite ) , who he drags along when he pulls off a prison break . Nothing to set this apart from the dozens and dozens of other cop movies sitting on video store shelves - except Arabella's deliriously ( and yet enjoyably ) profane mouth . Bronson , as usual , doesn't do any more acting than he has to , leaving it up to the supporting cast to pick up the slack ( not that they all do a great job ) . Snodgress , at least , isn't bad as the villainess . It is sometimes funny in an unintentional way because it is pretty stupid . . . but I'll take my laughs any way that I can get them . Unfortunately , the lack of genuinely likable characters is a debit . Basically , it's just another addition to the 1980's Charles Bronson repertoire . Co-star Wilhoite also sings the title song over the closing credits .
399182	1391795	99278	5.0	Not as much fun as I would have liked .	Jack ( Ross Hagen , who also shares story credit and co-directed ) is a fashion photographer who calls to mind the title character from the 1978 thriller " Eyes of Laura Mars " . His big idea is to combine sex and violence by having his models pose with weapons and by setting them amid scenes of carnage . When he brings a bunch of girls to a ranch in the wilderness , people begin dying , thanks to a psycho obviously scarred by a traumatic upbringing . It's ultimately disappointing because for one thing there's an awful lot of time-wasting build-up here . It takes almost an hour for the movie to get to the good stuff , and even then there's not much in the way of T & A and violence . There's a lot of fine looking ladies , but they're kept clothed too much of the time . As things turn out , it's best to not take any of this seriously . A case in point : a ridiculous motorcycle accident . The climax has some decent special effects but it also gets positively silly as the killer starts making inane wisecracks . At the least , it's interesting to see Gregory Scott Cummins , as a jealous heel boyfriend , in a rare heroic role here , as you may have seen him usually playing some sort of scuzzy or villainous character in assorted action movies ( like " Stone Cold " ( 1991 ) or " Cliffhanger " ) . Hagen is certainly engaging in his role , with solid support from Troy Donahue as Hagens ' assistant and Hoke Howell as a mystery man hanging around . Keely Sims is appealing as Cindy . While not very satisfying overall , it was a mildly diverting hoot of a movie . Folks should just be warned beforehand that it comes up too short in the sleaze department .
399422	1391795	54673	5.0	" A man runs , someone shoots at him . "	Tor Johnson plays Joseph Javorsky , " noted scientist " as we are constantly reminded by the narration , who travels to the United States with important documents in a briefcase . Soviet agents tail him there and chase him into an atomic testing range where exposure to radiation turns him into a shambling monster that must go out and kill . Meanwhile , two local cops try to track him down . This is a monumentally ponderous and utterly ridiculous no-budget pile of junk that simply amazes because it's so bad . For a movie that only runs 54 minutes long it's staggering to think just how short it could have been had writer / director Coleman Francis had any sense of pacing . The music is hilariously melodramatic and is indicative of how seriously Francis seems to be taking his material . Johnson is a rather non-threatening killer ; it's actually sort of crazily endearing how non-threatening he is . ( One's gotta love that saccharine sweet ending where he kisses the bunny rabbit . Awww . ) Francis himself supplies the mind-boggling narration . It goes so overboard in attempts to be philosophical and profound and yet is so random ( " Flag on the moon . How'd it get there ? " ) and odd that it becomes positively gut-busting . As a matter of fact , any time this movie isn't just plain boring , it's hysterically silly . That one moment where Francis seems to be paying tribute to the crop dusting sequence of " North by Northwest " was certainly unexpected and highly amusing to say the least . It should be worth checking out for fans of Ed Wood's work to see both Johnson and Conrad Brooks , Brooks appearing in a small role as the man at the airfield . It's one of those enjoyably bad B's that viewers simply have to see for themselves .
398748	1391795	68414	5.0	Fairly enjoyable horror schlock .	From director Ted V . Mikels comes this silly movie that has an entertaining premise courtesy of Joseph Cranston and Arch Hall Sr . : to cut costs , cat food company bosses Landau ( Sanford Mitchell ) and Maltby ( J . Byron Foster ) start making human bodies the primary ingredient of their product . They use cadavers supplied by a gravedigger named Caleb ( Warren Ball ) , but it doesn't take much for them to start resorting to outright murder . While this is going down , a Dr . Howard Glass ( Sean Kenney ) and his sexy blonde nurse Angie Robinson ( Monika Kelly ) notice that pet cats are now attacking their owners , and that the cat food is the common denominator . So they start playing amateur detective and find themselves in lots of trouble . I had no illusions going in that this would be high quality stuff . I know of the directors ' work , so was prepared to be entertained for all the wrong reasons . That said , this was mildly amusing . It has its quirky little touches - Calebs ' partner Cleo ( Ann Noble ) carries around a doll that gets a serving of soup at dinner time , Landau and Maltby employ a mute named Tessie ( Drucilla Hoy ) who's also physically disabled . You can't accuse these guys of discrimination ! The obviously low , low budget allows for some chuckles . The corpse grinding machine is hilariously low-tech , but it still does the job of turning human bodies into hamburger in just seconds . The movie falls too short in some departments , namely gore and nudity . There's some hot looking women here , who do strip down to bra and panties , but that's as far as it goes . People expecting more of a sleaze fest are going to be disappointed . At least viewers can take pleasure in some of the sillier moments , like the hilariously unconvincing cat attacks . Overall , I thought it was a reasonably fun ridiculous low-budget genre flick . The good thing is that it's over fairly quickly .
399278	1391795	98184	5.0	Where have we heard this one before ?	Young boy who could never please his policeman father grows up to be a stone-faced , disturbed young psycho ( Judd Nelson ) who decides to start killing people when his plans to become a cop don't pan out . He is tracked by veteran Hollywood detective ( Robert Loggia ) who is saddled with new partner ( Leo Rossi ) who wants to show the older cop a thing or two about tracking down killers . The script , and the movie in general , are so routine and paint-by-the-numbers as to be laughable . The movie fails to provide a whole lot of entertainment value , but many of the actors ( including Nelson , offering a surprisingly decent performance ) manage to keep it watchable . Rossi is good and it's a shame this guy is rarely seen ( at least these days ) in mainstream movies . Loggia as always is excellent although his character comes off as a bit of a prick at first . And I always like it when I see Meg Foster ( as Rossi's wife ) in an ordinary role , given her tendency to be typecast as villainesses in B-movies . Lots of familiar faces here : George " Buck " Flower , Frank Pesce , Roy Brocksmith , Beau Starr , Ken Lerner , criminal-turned-author Edward Bunker ( as a cop ! ) , Angel Tompkins , et al . F . Y . I . Ken Lerner and Leo Rossi were also in " Hit List " , director William Lustig's previous movie released earlier the same year . They were also featured in scenes added to Lustig's 1988 movie " Maniac Cop " . Lustig himself appears as a cop .
399253	1391795	89200	5.0	Cheesy and bad but amusing .	Another movie of the 1980's to jump on the " Gremlins " bandwagon , this tells the story of Jonathan ( Peter Liapis ) , who inherits the mansion his Satan-worshipping father Malcolm ( rock singer Michael Des Barres ) conducted rituals in . Jonathan's curiosity gets the better of him and when he starts conducting rituals of his own , a variety of tiny beasts and a pair of dwarves arrive on the scene . " Ghoulies " is not exactly a quality horror / comedy , but it didn't suck badly enough for me to actively hate it . In fact , I thought that it was goofy enough to be amusing . The title creatures are a funny ( if undeniably ugly ) troupe of poorly manipulated puppets and unlike other films of its kind , " Ghoulies " does not go overboard in the gore department . Heck , the lead performances by Liapis and Lisa Pelikan , as his girlfriend , are actually better than I would have expected , and Des Barres ' cameo is enjoyably ( and not unbearably ) hammy . It's also good to see Jack " Eraserhead " Nance in the film's other major cameo . As long as you go in with low expectations , and do NOT take it seriously ( then again , how could you ? ) it's possible to derive some entertainment out of it . Followed by three sequels .
399629	1391795	404756	5.0	The President lives . . . and the movie stinks .	Astronaut Ivan Hood ( genre icon Bruce Campbell ) and his team return to Earth after a forty-year space mission to find that goofy alien termites have enslaved the human population ( making this a low , low , low rent variation on " Planet of the Apes " ) , with the assistance of various human thugs . Hood escapes from their clutches and rallies the folks in the area to fight back . I've heard enough about Sci-Fi channel movies to know what to expect going in , so I was prepared for a silly , laughable onslaught of cheese . But I would be inclined to agree that in this case it was definitely intentional . These people knew what kind of film they were making here and just had fun with it . And I'll be honest - the film has its moments - human heads gobbled up by the termites ( accompanied by a burst of CGI splatter ) , the termites themselves spraying green goop everywhere when they get killed - and it's ridiculous enough to generate some decent ( if not hearty ) laughs . A lot of the " acting " is pretty bad , too , although it's not like I would have expected anything more . Co-star Renee O'Connor is rather underwhelming as the love interest , excellent veteran character actor Peter Jason is wasted in a too-small part , and it's up to Campbell himself ( playing the material more straight than you'd think ) to give it a little bit of life . Filmed in attractive forest locations in Bulgaria , it's a mindlessly diverting romp made for the bad sci-fi lover and Bruce Campbell fan in many of us .
399640	1391795	203830	5.0	You might as well read a book instead .	Luke Sinclair ( Chris Sarandon ) is a novelist who specializes in serial killer stories ; despite his uncanny knack for getting into the heads of these degenerates , he claims he does no research ; he simply is good at seeing things from their point of view . Luke , suffering from a bad case of writer's block , retreats to rural Maine ( this film was actually shot in the Canadian province of New Brunswick , which is certainly close enough to Maine geographically ) . Instantaneously , a series of sex-related murders occur that seem to be patterned after the kills in " Reaper " , a previous Sinclair novel . Sexy state detective Catherine Mary Stewart and local sheriff Vlasta Vrana represent the law in this story that trods on awfully familiar thriller turf . I wouldn't consider it inept - it's made well enough - but it just seems too routine to work overall . The actors are good - veteran character actor Vrana gets a rare featured role here - but their roles are absolutely nothing special . All revelations made here are not exactly earth-shattering ; there's an obvious red herring and there's not a single story twist here that no-one could see coming . Just another paint-by-the-numbers B-grade thriller ; it might serve its purpose for less demanding viewers but if you want something original look elsewhere .
398656	1391795	71629	5.0	Nothing special or memorable , but passable low-budget 1970's horror .	Elderly Pauline Christophe lives in a nice old mansion atop a mountain where , yes , there is a skull visible in the rock . She arranges for four strangers - her kin - to come to the mansion , and after she passes away , the four experience a series of strange , voodoo-related occurrences . Minor African-American themed horror movie has some atmosphere and an entertaining music score going for it . It also has some likable characters and performances . Victor French ( ' Little House on the Prairie ' , ' Highway to Heaven ' ) is an interesting lead , and the classy looking Janee Michelle definitely has some appeal . Also prominent in the cast is Mike Evans of ' All in the Family ' and ' The Jeffersons ' to provide some comic relief . The film moves along well enough although the climactic voodoo ceremony goes on a little too long . It also could have used a touch more mystery . As a 1970's era B movie , I didn't think it was too bad . It kept me interested enough , and , to be sure , one just doesn't see films like this nowadays .
399184	1391795	58220	5.0	Good for a number of laughs .	This cheap , Florida-shot " horror " movie has playboy author Tom Harris ( William Joyce ) coerced into traveling to a remote island in the hopes that he'll find the rumors about the place - involving the walking dead - will inspire him to write a new novel . He finds the rumors to be true and seeks to escape along with his traveling companions , as well as the current object of his lust , Jeannie Biladeau ( Heather Hewitt ) , daughter of a local scientist . Pretty much right from the start I became aware that this would be functioning on an enjoyably bad level . The script is daft , the acting is silly , the makeup and the effects are cruddy , and the film-making in general just plain inept . There's no atmosphere , no suspense , no surprises - but a whole lot of infectiously unintentional ( ? ) comedy . The characters are all dolts , too ; Coral , played by Betty Hyatt Linton , is so shrill and strident that a viewer may beg for the zombies to get her . Unreleased for several years , writer / producer / director Del Tenney finally found a distributor in Jerry Gross , who would use it as a double bill with " I Drink Your Blood " and re-christen it " I Eat Your Skin " ( although the consumption of human flesh is not to be seen here ) . In any event , some folk may just find it appallingly bad , but if you're like me and most often get a kick out of lousy B movies , you just might be entertained by this one .
399199	1391795	185371	5.0	Not The Most Fun Movie Ever Made .	A handful of people are invited to the spend the night as part of a warped birthday party . The house they are invited to is an ugly nightmare that served as a barbaric insane asylum ( is there any other kind in horror films ? ) in the 1930's . If they survive the night , they each get one million dollars . VERY twisted , unpleasant , gory horror entry with some repellent characters ; I'm sure this will be fun for some hardcore horror fans , but I can't see a LOT of people liking it . Obviously more work went into the visual effects than in making the film coherent . This is a remake of a 1950's camp horror movie starring the indomitable Vincent Price . ( The two main characters , played by Geoffrey Rush and Famke Janssen , are named Price . ) While not having seen the original film , is it safe for me to assume it wasn't as explicit or graphic as this one ? ( Oscar-winner Rush is amusing doing his best Vincent Price impression . ) At least it's more politically correct than earlier horror movies . I'll be generous and give it . . . but it ain't worth more than that .
399450	1391795	84695	5.0	" What's the damage ? " " Six . . . so far . "	Escaped mass murderer Russ Thorn ( Michael Villella ) , with the aid of a portable power drill , slaughters the air-headed teenagers in a suburban neighborhood . That's all the plot there is . Unbelievably , this movie was directed and written by women ( Amy Jones and feminist author Rita Mae Brown respectively ) . I don't know what their intention was . Is this supposed to be a parody ? A horror comedy ? They didn't seem to have their tongues in their cheeks - I mean , the film seems to be taking itself seriously . All Jones and Brown have really done with " The Slumber Party Massacre " is to serve up the kind of ingredients that some fans of this stuff really salivate for : T & A and gore . That's ultimately the problem with " The Slumber Party Massacre " . It's virtually indistinguishable from other films of its kind , so whatever Jones and Brown had planned , the result is just another slasher film . Thorn's weapon of choice IS a little innovative - I mean , usually in slasher movies , all the killer ever uses is some sort of sharp object - a knife , an ax , what have you . And the sequence with the pizza boy ( played by co-producer Aaron Lipstadt ) is sort of memorable . The movie is quite gory , not very suspenseful ( despite all the darkness for the killer to lurk in ) , and very , very short . Acting is about what you would expect for a B-grade slasher : uninspired , although some of these ladies are good screamers ; features an early appearance by attractive B-movie veteran Brinke Stevens . Perhaps most surprisingly , the final showdown is better than I would have expected . " The Slumber Party Massacre " is ultimately silly , routine , and clichéd , and I'll be frank , it IS sleazy , exploitative trash - but that's what makes some of these films fun . It's light years removed from the more classy thrills of films like " Psycho " and " Halloween " , but it has something . Followed by two sequels .
398572	1391795	236493	5.0	Nothing Worth Getting Excited About .	Farcical crime comedy starring two attractive superstars , Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts , as a couple whose relationship is in trouble . The trouble is , he's an errand boy for the mob , and a terminal screw-up to boot . He's ordered to retrieve and transport an ancient , antique pistol to mob boss Margolese ( Gene Hackman ) but everything goes wrong for him . . . and I do mean everything . Meanwhile , Samantha ( Roberts ) has been kidnapped by a thug ( James Gandolfini ) as a means of insuring Jerry ( Pitt ) does the job right . Moderately funny , mildly successful film is okay but nothing more . Biggest problem is it goes on too long . Worth watching for the performances of Gandolfini and J . K . Simmons ; their scenes are the best in the film . I give it .
398773	1391795	120390	6.0	Ray Liotta's performance puts the film over . . .	On an eventful Christmas Eve , Teri Halloran ( Lauren Holly ) is a flight attendant on a commercial flight that happens to be transporting two criminals , one a conniving charmer ( Ray Liotta ) convicted of serial murder . Before too long , Ryan Weaver ( Liotta ) has instituted a reign of terror on the flight as the plane flies right into a heavy storm . Slick and contrived action-thriller that takes silliness to a new extreme . Stupid beyond belief and yet it's SO dumb it takes on an enjoyable life of its own , and I got caught up in the action . You sure don't have to think about this one , you can just watch it and be satisfied . Liotta is clearly having such a great time as his character that he helps to carry the film along through its most unbelievable moments . Holly does a respectable job , although I liked her co-star Catherine Hicks ( as the senior flight attendant Maggie ) more and thought it might have been nice if the two actresses could have switched roles . Incidentally , there were at least five technical advisors that worked on the film and I think that they must have done a very good job because they helped the actors involved to actually sound like they knew what they were talking about . Followed by two direct-to-video-and-DVD sequels .
398967	1391795	87796	6.0	" Just give me one night alone with the body . "	Your friendly neighborhood environment-polluting corporation is turning the residents of a small , small rural town into sick , diseased , zombie-like killers who seem to prefer the night life . Two vacationing big city boys ( Wings Hauser and Lee Montgomery ) pass through just in time to get caught up in these creepy ( if derivative ) events . For what is - low budget independent genre fare - it's really not all that bad . All of the gore and makeup is not as bad as some reviews might lead you to believe - it's just limited by what these film-makers have to work with . The acting is about what you'd expect as well - not inspired , but acceptable , good enough for this kind of film ( another familiar , and welcome , face in the cast is veteran good ol ' boy actor Bo Hopkins , stuck in an unimaginative part , but amusing as always ) . Director John " Bud " Cardos and company try to give this movie some semblance of atmosphere ( whoever was in charge of the fog machine sure earned their pay ) . Ultimately , the film doesn't really deliver in terms of real scares , but I wouldn't consider it a totally botched job either . The film-makers do display an " anything goes " mentality here - you'll see what I mean at about the 80-minute mark - and the finale is not too bad . I did rather enjoy the music from Richard Band , because it did help to set a serious tone . Despite similarities to the usual run of zombie movies , these creatures at least do exhibit some interesting , unusual traits , which helps the movie to rise ever-so-slightly beyond being just average . Overall , fair entertainment for those who want to check it out . It's known as " Mutant " on DVD so if you do go looking for it , that's the name you have to search for .
398622	1391795	105428	6.0	A man killed with corn-on-the-cob ! That's a first !	Original Stephen King screenplay about Mary and Charles Brady ( Alice Krige and Brian Krause ) who are , in reality , inhuman entities that get their nourishment from the essence of virginal girls , and are forced to constantly move from town to town in order to stay one step ahead of the law . In their current place of residence , Charles selects nice girl Tanya ( Madchen Amick ) as the latest meal , not realizing that his work is cut out for him this time . Overall , I look at it now and I believe that it's kind of lightweight fare . It's never remotely scary or intense - although there's enough gore , violence and profanity on hand to justify an " R " rating - with an awful lot of daytime material , and it's over pretty quickly and is eminently forgettable . That said , the screenplay has an enjoyable amount of offbeat humor , and Mick Garris directs just well enough . The acting is generally good , with the incredibly alluring Ms . Krige - who has yet to be really appreciated by a mainstream audience - in a standout performance . The special effects are very impressive , as well . In addition to our leads , the supporting cast features such familiar faces as Jim Haynie , Ron Perlman , Glenn Shadix , and as Tanya's parents , Cindy Pickett and Lyman Ward , whom any 1980's movie fan will realize also played husband and wife in " Ferris Buller's Day Off " . Bit parts are played by the likes of Rusty Schwimmer ( " Jason Goes to Hell : The Final Friday " ) , Ernie Lively ( " Simon Says " ) , Diane Delano ( " Jeepers Creepers 2 " ) and Stuart Charno ( horror fans will remember him as " Ted " from " Friday the 13th Part 2 " ) . Last but not least , there's an assortment of genre-favorite cameos by King himself ( of course ) , Tobe Hooper , Clive Barker , John Landis , and Joe Dante ; even an uncredited Mark Hamill makes an appearance . The director's wife Cynthia , a frequent performer in his projects , plays Laurie here . The film makes good use of a haunting , ominous earlier song by Enya called " Boadicea " , and , appropriately enough , an instrumental rock song called " Sleepwalk " gets played at least three times . Cat lovers may be pleased to see felines take on a proactive role in a horror film , but be warned that there are also repeated scenes of cruelty to cats ( Sleepwalkers have a critical aversion to them ) . This is fair horror entertainment . It's absolutely nothing special , but , like I said , it does have some things going for it , and it's certainly not among the worst examples of King-based cinema in existence . I think it deserves a little better than a 4 . 3 average .
398822	1391795	61005	6.0	A very silly and somewhat amusing horror flick .	200 years ago , one incredibly ugly witch is executed by Transylvanian townsfolk despite warnings that she needs to be exorcised instead . Then along come British couple Veronica ( horror icon Barbara Steele ) and Philip ( Ian Ogilvy ) who have a car accident that plunges them into the same lake where the witch was killed . And now Veronica has disappeared and the witch has taken her place . A modern day descendant of the Van Helsings ( John Karlsen ) is determined to dispense of the witch and wants things to be done right this time . The movie does have its moments , but they're mostly of the light-hearted variety . It has an approach that's blatantly comedic much of the time and renders it positively silly . The climactic car chase is the highlight in this sense . It's not totally lacking in atmosphere but really is not much of a horror film , just an amusing little romp . ( Director Michael Reeves and co-star Ogilvy would team up later for the superior " Witchfinder General " . ) Actor Mel Welles , Mr . Mushnik in the original " The Little Shop of Horrors " , delivers a blustery performance that is a lot of fun ; he was the other highlight of the movie for me . The usually bewitching Ms . Steele doesn't get to do much , unfortunately , and - in her human incarnation , anyway - is absent from the proceedings for too much of the movies ' brief running time . Words like " cheesy " and " tacky " can also easily come to the mind in watching this fairly engaging bit of nonsense . I enjoyed it to a degree , myself .
399067	1391795	275067	6.0	A fairly decent film - it has its flaws as well as assets .	Big city couple George ( Jake Weber ) and Kim ( Patricia Clarkson ) , with young son Miles ( Erik Per Sullivan ) in tow , travel to the snowy wilderness to stay at a friends ' place for the weekend . Their collision with a deer , and subsequent confrontation with some boorish local hunters , become the catalysts for the awfully strange events that are to follow . I'll get my concerns with the film out of the way so I can get on to the good stuff . I'll be honest ; it tried my patience for a while . Its pace was a little too leisurely . I also felt that the director , Larry Fessenden , got a little too fancy at times with his editing and camera movements . I felt that it was distracting , although , to be fair , it also lends the film a certain unnatural air . On the plus side , Fessenden ( who also wrote and edited ) maintains a powerfully ominous mood and incredible sense of foreboding . The actors , including young Sullivan , do a solid job , creating likable enough if not terribly interesting characters . Fessenden also gives the film a commendably ambiguous appeal - just what exactly in the film is real and what is imagined is never laid out for us . We're treated to some amusing if low-budget effects as the title Native American spirit plays a key role in the story . Michelle DiBuccis ' music is also quite excellent . Finally , it was refreshing as it always is for me to watch an unpredictable film where I couldn't be certain where it was going . Overall , it's pretty thoughtful and a fairly intriguing film if not completely satisfying . I'll give credit to Fessenden for crafting something that is definitely not a typical modern horror film .
399174	1391795	87469	6.0	The Middle Film Of The Trilogy Is The Weakest .	Prequel to " Raiders of the Lost Ark " takes place in 1935 . This time around , Indiana Jones ( Harrison Ford ) escapes from an encounter in Shanghai , accompanied by a bratty stage performer ( Kate Capshaw , who would become director Steven Spielberg's wife ) and a diminutive young sidekick ( Jonathan Ke Quan , billed as Ke Huy Quan ) . Indiana ends up in India , coming to the aid of some troubled villagers by infiltrating the evil Thuggee cult and retrieving a sacred stone that the cult had stolen . While it rates as a good adventure overall , there are some flaws too big to ignore : i ) a little too much unpleasantness in the film's middle section ( with scenes that seem more appropriate for a horror movie ) ; ii ) a highly annoying leading lady ( although I don't blame Capshaw ; she's just performing the role as written ) ; iii ) the opening nightclub sequence is more silly than anything ; iv ) Dan Aykroyd's brief cameo stands out like a sore thumb . v ) scenes of child abuse ( which should raise red flags for most people ) . The film does pick up in its final 30 + minutes , becoming genuinely rousing and invigorating ; the highlight is the mine car chase . But point number 5 leaves the film with a certain bad taste . Overall , I give it .
399896	1391795	62909	6.0	More like " Dracula Has Risen from the Grave AGAIN " .	The famed cinematic blood sucker ( Christopher Lee ) is revived and because a monsignor ( Rupert Davies ) has seen to it that he can't get back inside his castle , he's mad enough to go about seeking revenge as well as doing what he does best . Pretty standard Hammer horror . " Dracula Has Risen from the Grave " is made with style , and creates the appropriate amount of atmosphere and menace . Veteran , talented , and award-winning cinematographer and director Freddie Francis does a creditable job with what I think is actually kind of a routine script . As always , I found the stand-out elements to include James Bernard's ominous music score , the lavish sets , and Christopher Lee's performance . The movie actually features two climactic showdowns with Dracula , and they are both entertaining . In addition to Lee , Davies is solid and reliable as the monsignor , and other good supporting performances are by Barbara Ewing , Michael Ripper , and Ewan Hooper ( who was actually dubbed ) . Veronica Carlson is beautiful as the monsignor's victimized niece . Not great but not bad either .
399928	1391795	52929	6.0	An amiable little diversion .	From producer Robert E . Kent and director Edward L . Cahn , the team responsible for the sci-fi flick " It ! The Terror from Beyond Space " , comes this short , sweet , forgettable , but amusing minor sci-fi horror flick . Alien attackers come to Earth from the moon , with complete domination in mind . That's the familiar part of this movie . The twist here is that they can't be seen by the naked eye , preferring to take over and manipulate dead human bodies ( making this an interesting precursor to " Night of the Living Dead " ) . Jut-jawed military man John Agar , scientists Philip Tonge and Robert Hutton , with Tonges ' daughter Jean Byron in tow , have to figure out the intruders ' weakness and exploit it before the entire planet is devastated . I have to admit , I enjoyed this one to a degree . As low-budget 1950's era genre fare goes , it's passably entertaining . The pacing is a little slow ( which is saying something , since the movie is only an hour and eight minutes long ) and like many other movies of its type , there's a lot of exposition ( not to mention the ongoing presence of a narrator ) to listen to . The special effects actually aren't too bad , and the music was appropriate enough . The always engaging John Agar makes for a stolid and reliable hero , with Tonge ( who unfortunately died before the release of the movie ) standing out among the small supporting cast . John Carradine makes a very welcome cameo appearance as the first to be resurrected , with his booming voice heard through the balance of the movie as the voice of the alien intelligence . ( Writer Samuel Newman had also incorporated the name of his character , Karol Noymann , into his script for the earlier " The Giant Claw " . ) My favorite bit : a joke in which the front page of a newspaper cries : " First photo of Invisible Invader " , and of course the page is blank . It's a little too bad that more humor couldn't have been injected into the movie - it's played very straight-faced - but I liked the joke all the same . If you're like me and are partial to these cheesy little flicks to begin with , you might be able to have fun watching it . Whatever its flaws , it does at least do ( for me , anyway ) what it's supposed to do : it entertains .
399697	1391795	67929	6.0	Offbeat B-level vampire movie .	Good-looking young couple Lee ( Michael Blodgett ) and Susan ( Sherry Miles ) accept an invitation from brand-new acquaintance Diane ( Celeste Yarnall ) to stay at Dianes ' home in the desert . Diane reveals herself to be vampire-like in nature , although this movie plays out more like a variation on a vampire story rather than a traditional one . Victims don't become vampires themselves , our antagonist is not averse to sunlight , and so on . The desolate rural landscape is a refreshingly different environment in which to place this tale . To that end , cinematographer Daniel Lacambre gives it a nice sun-baked look . For a movie with a low budget ( from Roger Cormans ' company New World ) , director Stephanie Rothman , who co-wrote this script , infuses it with this constant weird and fairly haunting atmosphere . It's further enhanced by the music by Roger Dollarhide and Clancy B . Grass III , and that's not to mention some effective dream sequences . It feels as if Rothman and crew were trying to make this as " arty " as far as low-budget horror goes . The sexual content is fairly strong , as the very attractive Yarnall displays obvious desire for both her male and female house guests . Blodgett ( who resembles Eric Stoltz quite a bit ) of " Beyond the Valley of the Dolls " fame and Miles aren't terribly dynamic leads here ( especially Miles ) , leaving it up to Yarnall to give the movie some sort of anchor . She certainly does seem to be enjoying herself . The cast also includes Gene Shane , Jerry Daniels , Sandy Ward , and Robert Tessier . Leading to a not-bad chase sequence , a very unconventional dispatch for our sultry blood sucker , and a not unexpected downbeat final twist , " The Velvet Vampire " ranks as one of the more off-kilter " erotic vampire " movies of the 1970's .
399753	1391795	90184	6.0	A mildly amusing serving of 80's trash .	Betsy Russell is " Tommy " , the title character who enjoys tinkering with automobiles and is quite the good mechanic . She meets Randy Starr ( Gerard Christopher ) , a hunky racing champion whom she crushes on , but to whom she is determined to prove that anything he can do , she can do just as well . " Tomboy " is a likable enough comedy that , like many of its kind , strongly evokes the 80's era . Granted , I think it could have done without a subplot involving Tommy's uninhibited friend Seville ( Kristi Somers ) that isn't even resolved , and it gets too cute and sappy at times , but it's comfortably predictable . It's got lots of cheesy 80's pop tunes , and doses of sex , flesh , and sleaze are high enough . It's not terribly funny , although it has its moments . ( Seville's raunchy donut commercial is hilariously silly . ) It definitely takes its message of female empowerment pretty seriously . It does work as a vehicle for the charming and sexy Russell , who is certainly easy to watch . Standing out in support is veteran Richard Erdman , as her father-figure boss at the garage , with Eric Douglas ( son of Kirk and brother of Michael ) perfectly smarmy and sleazy as a spoiled rich kid . Basically , it's all pretty typical and unmemorable . It's bouncy , harmless , and hard to completely resist . At least it knows its audience and how to appeal to it .
399313	1391795	82498	6.0	Not Bad For A Slasher Movie .	Virginia " Ginny " Wainwright ( Melissa Sue Anderson ) is one of the " Top Ten " , an exclusive clique of rich kids at the Canadian institution of Crawford Academy . However , what is more noteworthy is the fact that her friends have begun to get killed off - and Ginny thinks that she might be responsible . She's been having blackouts and flashbacks that are linked to a tragic incident in her past . While Leonard Maltin and company consider this to be the absolute lowest point in actor Glenn Ford's career ( he plays Ginny's sympathetic psychiatrist ) the movie itself is fairly unique for the slasher genre . It plays almost as if it were based on a novel and not written directly for the screen - what I mean is that it is actually more dependent on plot and performances than many a slasher movie . It plods along ( it's probably also the longest slasher movie ever made at an hour and fifty-one minutes ) and not all of the murders are as gory as you might expect . In fact , until late in the movie , the goriest sequence is actually the one of the operation Ginny had after the accident . It takes some getting used to , and I wouldn't recommend it to rabid slasher fans - no sex , and , like I just said , not as much explicit violence as in other movies of its kind ( however , there is one funny moment near the end when a character is killed by a blow to the head with a fireplace poker and an obscenely ridiculous amount of blood splashes over the walls ) . Anderson is a reasonably sympathetic lead and there are a few familiar faces in the supporting cast . The writing has the usual fair assortment of flaws - although the movie's final twist is amusing enough to make it somewhat memorable . Other slasher movies filmed in Canada ( which I have reviewed , anyway ) include " Terror Train " , " Prom Night " , and " My Bloody Valentine " . Produced by Canadian producers John Dunning and Andre Link , who also ushered in the first major Canadian horror movie , David Cronenberg's movie " Shivers " ( a . k . a . " They Came From Within " ) .
398968	1391795	73820	7.0	An okay time filler , but finally comes to life in the last dozen minutes or so .	Here's a memorable TV anthology made in the days when the ' movie of the week ' was the big thing , back in the 1970's . It's based on a trio of Richard Matheson stories , with the first two scripted by William F . Nolan , and the third - the most effective - by Matheson himself . If nothing else , it serves as an exemplary showcase for the talented , offbeat veteran actress Karen Black , appearing in all three episodes in a variety of character roles . " Julie " has her playing a spinster-type teacher , taken advantage of by an impossibly creepy student ( Robert Burton ) , who comes on to her , takes her to a drive-in where he slips a drug into her soda , takes her to a hotel , and takes compromising photos of her . He's not done with her yet . . . but she has a surprise in store for him . " Millicent and Therese " features Black as two wildly different siblings at odds with each other . Millicent is a repressed type , similar to Julie in the first story , convinced that Therese ( a flamboyant sexpot ) is a Satanist and murderer and determined to put an end to her wicked ways . Finally , " Amelia " ( based on the Matheson story " Prey " ) stars Black as a lady who can't decide between spending time with her obviously clingy mother and her new boyfriend . The Zuni fetish doll she has purchased for the boyfriend comes to " life " and terrorizes her and attacks her in some highly stylized action scenes ( as has been said before , the makers of 1988's " Child's Play " may very well have been inspired by this tale ) . Each of the stories comes with a twist ending , although I have to say the second story's twist I saw coming pretty much from the start ( and if I saw it coming , you probably will too ) . The best , of course , is saved for last . It's just perfect . I gotta love that final image . It's fair entertainment until those final dozen minutes , and then it really grabs one's attention . In addition to Black , some familiar faces like John Karlen ( ' Cagney and Lacey ' , " Daughters of Darkness " ) , George Gaynes ( ' Punky Brewster ' , the entire " Police Academy " series ) , and Gregory Harrison ( ' Falcon Crest ' ) can be seen in supporting roles . Black , director Dan Curtis , and writer Nolan re-teamed for the theatrical effort " Burnt Offerings " the following year .
399868	1391795	120524	7.0	This should deliver the goods for some horror fans .	The Djinn ( Andrew Divoff ) , or genie if you want to call him that , escapes from his imprisonment inside a gem , and stalks L . A . looking for Alex ( Tammy Lauren ) , the one who inadvertently set him free . Since he wants a quota of souls , he grants wishes to all those in his path , but puts a horrible spin on each of them so that each person is punished rather than rewarded . Once he has granted three wishes to Alex , his kind will be free to take over our world . The mythology and admittedly slim plot are really just set-ups for an hour and a half long assortment of gruesome set pieces . " Wishmaster " is a lively affair , and as befitting a directorial effort by a makeup effects veteran ( Robert Kurtzman ) , it's just bursting with gore . A lot of it , however , is actually kind of cartoonish and outlandish , more " fantasy " type gore than " realistic " type gore . I loved that skeleton that ripped free of its owners ' body ! The way I see it , this is a film basically for horror fans , made by horror fans . The cast reads like a virtual Who's Who of horror , with Candyman ( Tony Todd ) , Jason ( Kane Hodder ) , Freddy ( Robert Englund ) , The Tall Man ( Angus Scrimm , a . k . a . the opening narrator ) , as prime examples . Writer Peter Atkins , also a genre veteran , even names some of the characters after noted science fiction authors . Divoff is positively great as The Djinn , and in addition to his scenes in the costume and makeup , plays several scenes as Nathanial Demerest , a human disguise for the creature , doing so with a subtly sinister charm . Lauren is okay as the heroine , a little tougher than some horror movie bimbos ( she plays tennis and coaches girls ' basketball ) but also a tortured kind of lead ( there was a traumatic incident in her childhood ) . Be on the lookout for the late Buck Flower , once again playing a bum like no-one else can , and reeling off some great improvised insults . Overall , a wild , entertaining film that of course created a new franchise monster that went on to appear in three direct-to-video sequels ( two of them without Divoff , unfortunately ) . Director Kurtzman is the guy killed by the piano .
399808	1391795	54462	7.0	Perfectly acceptable low , low-budget schlock .	Not-bad Roger Corman quickie about cosmetics magnate Janice Starlin ( Susan Cabot ) , who , in order to remain competitive in her business , is intent on fighting the aging process . She realizes she's found an answer of sorts in mad scientist Eric Zinthrop ( Michael Mark ) , who proves to her that the royal jelly that he's extracted from wasps has genuine reverse-aging abilities on animals . She volunteers herself as a human guinea pig , only to turn into the title creature . While not without some intelligent aspects to the script ( by actor Leo Gordon ) - commenting on vanity , insecurity , the need to be competitive in any sort of industry or business - it's first and foremost a likable , if obviously extremely low-tech , little flick . Scary it's not , but Corman paces it with typical efficiency and gets good performances out of his main cast , including the winsome Barboura Morris , and the solid Fred ( a . k . a . Anthony ) Eisley and William Roerick , all playing the concerned employees with real earnestness . Corman regular Bruno Ve Sota turns up in a small , small role as a night watchman . ( You can even see Corman himself in an uncredited cameo role as a doctor at a bedside . ) The attacks and murders are actually on the surprisingly nasty side , showing a little more blood than I would have expected . The only disappointing element is , obviously the makeup effects , although that's entirely to be expected given the budget and the time when this was made . However , the picture gets a real debit , however , for that way-too-silly music score . These kinds of pictures often have a real sincerity to them that is appealing ; " The Wasp Woman " stands as a reasonably enjoyable film of its kind , taking its ridiculous premise seriously and delivering an endearing dose of B ( or should I say W for Wasp ? ) movie entertainment . Sort of remade as " Evil Spawn " in the 1980's , and officially remade by Corman for TV in the 1990's .
398791	1391795	45787	7.0	Nicely done mad scientist tale .	This early sci-fi entry from Hammer Studios concerns lifelong friends Robin ( John Van Eyssen ) and Bill ( Stephen Murray ) . They develop a machine dubbed " the reproducer " , which creates copies of objects . They also happen to be in love with the same girl , Lena ( Barbara Payton ) . Bill is devastated when Lena chooses Robin , but decides to use the reproducer to clone Lena , creating Helen ( Payton again ) . However , because Helen is such a perfect copy of Lena , she has the same thoughts , feelings , and also loves Robin . Even more distraught than before , Bill tries to use electro-shock therapy to erase Helens ' memories , causing nothing but tragedy . Not bad at all , I think this works because the characters are likable enough , even Bill ( who wouldn't feel bad for a guy who loses two girls to the same guy ? ) . One can perfectly understand his actions if not condone them . As guided by prolific genre director Terence Fisher , it's character-driven , effectively dramatic , and moves at a slow , deliberate pace . Performances are good , with James Hayter the lovable old doctor who has nothing but fondness for these three individuals whom he watched grow up . Hayter also provides the narration . It's a good little cautionary story and low-budget sci-fi movie .
399072	1391795	325214	7.0	Decent slasher hijinks for those who don't take their horror too seriously .	This fairly amusing bit of junky nonsense involves an undead miner , Jeremiah Stone , who long ago made a deal with the devil and placed a curse - fairly typical stuff for a horror movie villain . What he really aims to do is keep other peoples ' mitts off his precious gold - by any means necessary , of course . When an all-too-typical troupe of 20-something idiots decides to play treasure hunt , they buy themselves a whole lot of trouble . " Silly " would be the easiest way for me to describe this . It sure isn't scary in the slightest ; right off the bat it shows the villain being resurrected and wastes no time in giving him victims to messily dispatch . It does have a feeling of " let's just have fun " to it and therefore is kind of hard to resist . Slashers fans need to be warned in advance , however , that it's pretty low in the sex department , and that , despite some decent splatter and makeup effects , may not be as gory as some viewers would prefer . Those interested ( such as I was ) by the presence of veterans such as John Phillip Law , Richard Lynch , Vernon Wells , Martin Kove , Jeff Conaway , and Karen Black should also know that most of their roles are rather small ( Law , Wells , and Kove were also associate producers ) . The inimitable Black makes the biggest impression , playing a nicely kooky ( if clichéd ) role , although Wells ( probably best known by most people as Wez in " The Road Warrior " and Bennett in " Commando " ) has fun as the human incarnation of the mad killer . As could be expected , not much can be said about the younger cast members , although I found Carrie Bradac really cute and appealing and Alexandra Ford is an undeniable hottie . If you don't mind a horror movie that makes you laugh rather than scaring you , you might find this up your alley . Even if it's standard-issue , disposable stuff , it's possible to derive some fun out of it .
399435	1391795	89679	7.0	Pretty good stuff .	Sean S . Cunningham's third post - " Friday the 13th " directorial effort is a 1980's teen thriller about Abby ( Lori Loughlin ) and Loren ( Shannon Presby ) , two kids who move in with their aunt and uncle in Florida after a car crash claims their parents . They are soon menaced by bullying punk Eddie Dutra ( James Spader ) and his disgusting gang of flunkies . Overall , a watchable movie with likable protagonists and the kind of antagonists you just love to hate ( despite not being particularly imposing physically , Spader does exhibit a certain sleazy malevolence ) . It's nothing special at first , but the climax is worth waiting for , because if you enjoy seeing movie bad guys get what they deserve ( and these are REALLY bad guys ) , then you'll be glad you stuck around . I basically liked this for the cast ( the future star of the ' Friday the 13th ' TV series , John D . LeMay , has a bit part ) , especially Loughlin , and Eddie Jones as the uncle , a friendly , gregarious sort even if he is something of a dreamer . Eric Stoltz is on hand as a ' nice guy ' love interest for Loughlin , and Tom Atkins is in it , too , but not for very long . I also liked the songs . Since this film , Cunningham has continued to direct ( particularly the 1989 under water monster movie " DeepStar Six " ) but has mainly concentrated on producing instead . F . Y . I . The screenwriter of this film was future director Stephen Gyllenhaal , father of Jake and Maggie G .
399528	1391795	77904	7.0	Admittedly not a " good " film , but still kind of fun .	Based on the novel by Graham Masterton , " The Manitou " gives us a story of a young woman ( Susan Strasberg ) with an enlarged tumor on her neck that is determined to be a rapidly growing fetus . Furthermore , it's the current incarnation of an Indian medicine man who has lived on for 400 years and counting . While I usually give so-bad-they're-good films , this picture is so bizarre , fanciful , and schlocky , it takes on such a you've - gotta - see - it - to - believe - it quality , I felt I would boost the rating . If it's not one thing , it's another - an old lady levitating and careening down some stairs , hospital floors that turn into walk-in freezers , the creepy little Indian spirit Misquamacus ( played by little people actors Joe Gieb and Felix Silla ) and his striking orbs , a cheesy final act involving a 1970's era light show , and more . The way I see it , what's not to like about a campy , outrageous horror thriller that actually seems to be taking itself seriously ? I don't see films like this every day . The swan song for cult director William Girdler ( who tragically died in a helicopter crash while scouting locations for a follow-up film ) , he sure gave us one heck of a spectacle to sign off with . An amazing troupe of high-profile stars ( Tony Curtis , Ann Sothern , Burgess Meredith , Stella Stevens ) perform with amazingly straight faces , supported by such folks as Jon Cedar ( who acted in Girdlers ' " Day of the Animals " ) , Paul Mantee ( " Robinson Crusoe on Mars " ) , and Lurene Tuttle ( " Psycho " 1960 ) . Michael Ansara is Indian medicine man John Singing Rock , in a standout performance . Effects are dodgy , especially a lizard being guaranteed to induce some chuckles . But I have to tell you that that final act just beats it all . It's all punctuated by a nice Lalo Schifrin music score that , again , is incredible for sounding serious , as if you were watching a different kind of film . I'll say it - I enjoyed this film . As a guilty pleasure , this would have to rank as a new personal favorite .
398687	1391795	77889	7.0	Good job by all concerned .	Adapted by veteran writer William Goldman from his own novel , this tale would almost certainly fall under the " psychological thriller " description common to a number of todays ' films . Sir Anthony Hopkins is Corky , an awkward , timid type who tries his hand at magic but doesn't become a success until he adds a distraction / sidekick in the form of his crude , outrageous dummy , Fats ( voiced by Hopkins himself ) . Corkys ' agent , Ben Greene ( a typically grandiose , wonderful Burgess Meredith ) gets for him a deal for a TV pilot ; however , Corky is afraid to fail the required medical exam , and hightails it to a lakeside cabin where he reconnects with high school crush Peggy Ann Snow ( Ann-Margret ) . As the film progresses , Corky becomes more hopelessly dependent on Fats and less and less stable . It's all about the acting in this intriguing , subtle , somber , and reasonably creepy little thriller : the endearingly humble and soft-spoken veteran thespian Hopkins offers proof that he's always at his best when playing characters who are , if not outright villainous , at least damaged or off-putting in some way . Yet , for all his inner anguish and antagonistic tendencies , Hopkins makes Corky sympathetic , helping what is essentially a deliberately paced film over its slower portions . Ann-Margret is definitely appealing as the wistful Peggy , and Ed Lauter does a bang-up job in the role of a boozing , distant , inadequate husband that is fortunately more than just one-dimensional . A little more blood is shown than one might expect for veteran actor-director Richard Attenborough , who agreed to direct this picture basically for the purposes of raising money for his Oscar-winning biopic " Gandhi " . Here he directs with a sure hand , making " Magic " a rather classy , rather than merely exploitive , affair . The cloudy skies throughout help to set the dour mood of this tragic story , and Jerry Goldsmith's truly excellent music score is perfect accompaniment . Fats himself becomes an appropriately uncomfortable presence ; there's just something inherently creepy about dummies and this film certainly makes that point clear , if nothing else . These are all good reasons for watching " Magic " , but the bottom line is to see it for Hopkins's performance . He is definitely the star attraction here .
399563	1391795	105242	7.0	Gotta love that final showdown . . .	According to other User Comments here , this is a noticeably faithful adaptation of the H . P . Lovecraft story " The Case of Charles Dexter Ward " , previously filmed ( although less faithfully ) in the 1960's , as " The Haunted Palace " with Vincent Price . Well-off scientist Ward ( Chris Sarandon ) has his curiosity get the better of him when old family artifacts come into his possession . His distraught wife Claire ( Jane Sibbett , probably best known as Ross's lesbian ex-wife on ' Friends ' ) goes to private detective John March ( John Terry , seen since on TV series ranging from ' E . R . ' to ' 24 ' to ' Las Vegas ' to ' Lost ' ) and asks him to find out just what weirdness her husband is up to . Although more drawn out than I think it needed to be ( that " haunted house walk " goes on for a pretty long time before anything really happens ) , this is actually reasonably entertaining , with director Dan O'Bannon ( directing for the first and only time since 1985's " The Return of the Living Dead " ) capably bringing the story to life . I will say this . . . when O'Bannon decides to let the audience have it , he REALLY lets them have it , with impressively hideous splatter . Sibbett and Terry are merely OK , but Sarandon - who ends up playing more than one role - is definitely worth watching . Robert Romanus , a . k . a . Mike Damone of " Fast Times at Ridgmont High " is on hand as March's leg man . The dark and rainy skies of British Columbia work to set the mood for this little horror piece , worth catching for fans of the genre . Incidentally , for those of you who have asked , this has recently been released on DVD by Lions Gate , but in full screen only and with absolutely no extras . Too bad .
398692	1391795	206314	7.0	Candy Cane ? Are You There ?	Nice-guy college student Lewis ( Paul Walker ) is going to his would-be girlfriend Venna's ( Leelee Sobieski ) college to drive her home and stops to bail his slacker brother Fuller ( Steve Zahn ) out of jail . Fuller soon coerces Lewis into playing a prank on a deep-voiced trucker using Lewis's CB radio . ( I didn't know they still made those things ! ) Since this is a chase thriller , it goes without saying that the prank produces horrifying results , and the trucker ends up pursuing Lewis and Fuller and Venna across the Southwest . Joy Ride's script does pose some questions ( How is it that Rusty Nail ( the trucker's CB handle ) is always able to know details about Lewis and Fuller , and where they are and what they are up to ? ) , but it's so well-made technically , exciting , and well-acted , that the script kind of takes a backseat to the film-makers's skills . ( That sequence in the hotel room IS kind of scary . ) You may be riveted in spite of yourself . One thing to comment on : both the video and DVD feature a 29-minute alternate ending that is worth checking out . Maybe some of you will actually prefer this ending , who knows ? I would give it .
398866	1391795	87597	7.0	Entertaining , family-friendly sci-fi .	Teenager Alex Rogan ( Lance Guest ) is despondent over the fact that he can't seem to escape from his mundane trailer park existence . Little does he know that the arcade game that he has mastered is actually a recruiting tool to find individuals who can help an alien civilization defend themselves from interstellar villains . " Cute " probably would be the most apt description of this 1980's product , a harmless , effects and design driven " Star Wars " variation with a most likable cast . Guest and his love interest Catherine Mary Stewart have a real earnestness and down-to-earth quality ( Guest also has an amusing scene where's he's acting opposite himself ) . Veteran actors Robert Preston , as " Centauri " , and Daniel O'Herlihy , as ' gung-ho iguana ' Grig , are a pleasure to watch , with O'Herlihy stealing all of his scenes . There's no real objectionable content , and not much in it that might prove to be too scary for the younger viewer . Overall , it is kind of lightweight and not terribly memorable , but it does have its charms .
399575	1391795	58753	7.0	Beware the lady in gray .	A nice mixture of the contemporary and the Gothic , this occult tale features two feuding families , the Whitlocks and the Laniers . In modern times , the Laniers , in the name of progress , are bulldozing their way through a cemetery , and desecrate the tomb of a Whitlock from the 16th century - a witch , killed by being buried alive . In the name of revenge , death comes to the Laniers one at a time . With lovable old pro and genre star Lon Chaney delivering a fine lead performance with real gusto , this decent horror film is good for some chills and thrills . Jack Hedley is a stolid hero , and Jill Dixon , David Weston , and Diane Clare contribute likable supporting performances . Yvette Rees is a striking presence as the cold-eyed , vengeance-crazed , undead - and somehow , quite alluring - witch . It's a good looking film with sharp black and white photography and some good sets . It has atmosphere , suspense and a really intense , fiery finish . Written by the prolific Harry Spalding ( " House of the Damned " , " The Earth Dies Screaming " ) and directed with conviction by Don Sharp ( " The Kiss of the Vampire " , " Curse of the Fly " ) , it's a solid and engaging if not exceptional movie .
399304	1391795	95963	7.0	Routine 1980's era buddy-cop movie enlivened by good cast .	The Governator plays Captain Ivan Danko , a humorless and utterly stiff Russian cop who tracks ultra-sleazy / nasty Georgian drug dealer Viktor Rosta ( Ed O'Ross ) to Chicago , where local detective Art Ridzik ( James Belushi ) , a crass , wisecracking jerk is stuck with the job of playing babysitter to Danko while he attempts to escort Rosta back to Russia . There are enough elements here that are too familiar to make the film itself more than ordinary . There's the fish-out-of-water concept , the mismatched-partners concept , the culture clash concept , and so on . It's true that the two protagonists are not terribly likable , but at least they do manage to get some laughs , and Schwarzenegger and Belushi do have an adequate amount of odd-couple chemistry . It's all entertaining enough ; director Walter Hill has been an action expert for about three decades now and at least he creates some competently staged fights and chase scenes . The supporting cast includes Peter Boyle , Belushi's gruff boss who isn't quite the stereotypical angry , yelling boss common to action films . Larry Fishburne is good as a co-worker of Belushi's who dislikes him intensely . Gina Gershon has one of her earliest roles as the hapless dance instructor who gets in over her head by agreeing to marry Rosta . Other familiar faces include some Walter Hill regulars ( like Brion James and Peter Jason ) , as well as Brent Jennings ( great in a brief cameo as a drug kingpin determined to strike back at white men by getting them all hooked on drugs ) , Pruitt Taylor Vince , Kurt Fuller , etc . This film does have the distinction of having scenes that were actually filmed on location in Russia , which is a little bit of a bonus . Mostly , I felt it was rather standard action fare , despite the assets it did have . One lasting impact was the fact that O'Ross's performance as the villain would often get him typecast as Russian characters from that point on .
398960	1391795	115610	7.0	Not bad as werewolf movies go .	Country dwelling lawyer Janet ( Mariel Hemingway ) is thrilled when her globe-trotting brother Ted ( Michael Pare ) arrives stateside . However , good old Ted isn't telling her everything that she should know - what we in the audience already know thanks to the prologue . Only Thor ( Primo ) , the family dog , senses something is wrong about Ted . Clocking in at a surprisingly short 80 minutes , " Bad Moon " would never compare to fare such as " The Wolf Man " , " Curse of the Werewolf " , " The Howling " , or " An American Werewolf in London " . Or more recent fare such as " Ginger Snaps " and " Dog Soldiers " , for that matter . Writer / director Eric Red , whose noteworthy genre credits include " The Hitcher " , " Near Dark " , and " Body Parts " , takes his material seriously , and gets good performances out of Hemingway , Pare , and young Mason Gamble as Hemingways ' son . The movie is technically well made , with decent CGI effects and a ferocious looking werewolf . Slick cinematography of the forest setting is also a plus . It's basically fairly enjoyable , and moves along pretty well . It's just not particularly scary or suspenseful and is rather predictable . The best part is Primo , a beautiful and obviously well trained German Shepherd who ends up the main reason to watch the movie . It's not destined to become a classic , but is a watchable enough movie of its type .
399175	1391795	119468	7.0	KISS ME .	Based upon James Patterson's best-seller . A smooth , egomaniacal serial killer who fancies himself a connoisseur of extraordinary women holds his victims captive in an underground lair , and only murders them when they break his rules . However , he makes two crucial mistakes : first , when he nabs the violin-playing niece ( Gina Ravera ) of a famed , exceptional Washington D . C . forensic psychologist ( Morgan Freeman ) who is determined to find and save her . Second , when another of his intended victims ( Ashley Judd ) manages to escape from him - and becomes just as determined to save the other girls . Although in some ways a standard-issue Hollywood-made Cop Vs . Killer Movie , it is professionally handled , well-acted ( especially by Freeman and Judd ) and watchable throughout , so that it ends up a little above average . It does feature an important plot twist I haven't seen in any other movie like this . A couple of quibbles , though : 1 ) The killer's identity may be too easy for some to guess . 2 ) Considering the way Alex Cross ( Freeman ) ultimately ID's the sicko , you'd think SOMEBODY else would have been sharp enough to notice this evidence . Still , I considered it time well spent . Of course , I'll watch anything Morgan Freeman is in ; the man is just phenomenal , carrying the picture in his usually quiet , authoritative manner .
398991	1391795	75005	7.0	Decent religious horror thriller .	Robert Thorn ( screen legend Gregory Peck ) is the US Ambassador to England and on the night that his wife Katherine ( Lee Remick ) loses their baby , he is convinced to " adopt " an infant on the spot . By the time the child has reached the age of five , those closest to the kid realize there is something wrong with him and Robert investigates the kid's origins with photographer Jennings ( David Warner ) . The movie carefully moves along , with a controlled performance by the always dignified Peck . It features some memorable murder set-pieces ( not showing more blood than is necessary , however ) , particularly the decapitation , which you have to see to believe . Sometimes fairly creepy - the best sequence is the night-time one set in the old graveyard with the devil dogs milling about . The story is interesting enough but those of you who can guess the plot developments and outcome early on may be impatient by the film's slow pace . Not that scary but it IS competently made , with climax that starts out suspenseful and ends up harrowing . Good supporting performances by Warner and Billie Whitelaw , too . To date , this movie has been followed by three sequels , the last made for television .
398658	1391795	58050	7.0	Short and sweet and effective little sci-fi effort .	Throughout Britian , people are dying suddenly . Before long , there are very few people left . A handful of survivors hole up in an old inn and formulate their plan for survival , and eventual escape . Although this likable British B picture runs barely over an hour , it packs enough tension and creepiness into its running time to qualify as a good time . Directed with maximum efficiency by Terence Fisher , the man behind some of the great Hammer horror films , it draws you in with a decent , if unoriginal , premise and moves at a respectable pace . About all that contributes to its cheese factor are some silly and quaint looking robots . The actors , led by American Willard Parker , do a good job at maintaining one's interest ; prominent among the supporting cast is genre veteran Thorley Walters . Not only do these survivors have the invading robots to contend with , but some of the victims are turned into unwitting slaves for the robots , shambling along with their eyes turned utterly blank . It's a nice little pre - " Night of the Living Dead " effect that adds to the menace . One standout suspense sequence finds the female lead ( Virginia Field ) trapped inside a building and slowly being encroached upon , by both the robots and the human slaves . A neat , compact end-of-the-world story that really delivers , " The Earth Dies Screaming " ( a good title , if not entirely appropriate ) is worth checking out and truly does make for a good " midnite movie " .
399404	1391795	49370	7.0	Very watchable early sci-fi from Roger Corman .	Reasonably entertaining Roger Corman cheapie about dedicated scientist Tom Anderson ( Lee Van Cleef ) , who establishes contact with a monster from Venus and helps it every step of the way . Tom is convinced the monster's arrival can only mean good for the human race , but he couldn't be more wrong . It sends out bat-like creatures that implant control devices in people's necks and make them susceptible to doing the monster's bidding . All that stands in its way is heroic scientist Paul Nelson ( Peter Graves ) . " It Conquered the World " explores the same ideas as " Invasion of the Body Snatchers " ; basically , it deals with the loss of humanity and emotions as individuals begin acting as one for a sinister purpose . It's a good deal of fun , with Graves the perfect stoic hero and Van Cleef doing great work as his misguided colleague . Beverly Garland is quite good as Van Cleef's wife , as she desperately tries to appeal to him to do the right thing ( she's also obliged to utter the truly gut-busting line " So that's what you look like ! You're ugly . . . horrible ! " and does it with an admirably straight face ) . As could be expected , Corman has roles for repertory players Dick Miller and Jonathan Haze as soldiers . The effects are something less than special , but they are good for some major guffaws : the monster is one of the silliest looking things that I've ever seen . It's very funny to watch the actors do all the work as they mime being killed by the thing ! All the same , the movie plays out its alien invasion plot with good pacing , and comes up with some pretty good shocks . It's a fun little B sci-fi movie , over in record time , with a great midnight movie charm going for it . Re-made as " Zontar : The Thing from Venus " in
399707	1391795	53611	7.0	Fun and engaging low , low-budget schlock .	In a Florida swamp , the locals are starting to disappear . What could be the culprit ? It's all right there in the title . Stoic , hunky game warden hero Steve Benton ( Ken Clark ) , with the assistance of girlfriend Nan Greyson ( Jan Shepard ) and her father ( Tyler McVey ) sets out to investigate what we in the audience already know . Executive produced by Roger Corman and produced by his brother Gene , this A . I . P . flick is not all that bad for its type of film . Director Bernard L . Kowalski establishes the sense of danger and a chilling mood right from the get-go , crafting a tight and trim little sci-fi / horror flick clocking in at just over an hour . The level of atmosphere is right up there , as well . Actor Leo Gordons ' script is amusing , with some decidedly goofy lines here and there . Best of all is the scene in the underwater cave with the monsters approaching their victims and then chowing down on them ; this scene is surprisingly graphic and nasty for a 1950's film . In addition to our likable leads , 1950's era hottie Yvette Vickers ( the mistress in " Attack of the 50 Ft . Woman " ) lights up the screen as Liz , the dissatisfied wife of burly store owner Dave Walker ( a solid Bruno Ve Sota ) who likes turning on the sex appeal any chance she gets . Gene Roth is hilariously surly as an incredulous sheriff . The monsters themselves may be on the blatantly cheesy side , but they ultimately add to the appeal of the film . And , basically , that's really what it's all about . It's just fun , plain and simple ; aside from yet another dig at the advent of atomic energy with a perfunctory possible explanation for the creatures ' existence , this is extremely unpretentious , engaging nonsense .
399223	1391795	95179	7.0	The Debut Of Kane Hodder As Jason	Viewers of this movie are witness to yet another Jason resurrection when an emotionally unstable teenager ( Lar Park Lincoln ) who accidentally killed her father years ago returns to Crystal Lake and inadvertently releases Jason from his watery tomb . Everybody in the cast is doomed . . . An " F13 " entry that runs hot and cold . At times it's pretty bad , with characters and dialog that are not merely aggravating but infuriating ( and in the case of Dr . Crews ( Terry Kiser ) , reprehensible ) . Yet , the idea of a female hero with telekinesis proving to be more than a match for Jason is definitely worthy . Yes , it's a high concept " F13 " entry : " Carrie Vs . Jason " would certainly have been an apt subtitle for the movie . Stuntman Kane Hodder , in his first of four appearances as Jason , proves to be the best of the Jason performers due to real forcefulness and physical menace in the role . The showdown between Tina ( the heroine ) and Jason isn't quite earth-shattering but it does prove to be worth sticking around for . The " F13 " movies were getting more ethnically diverse ( starting in Part V ) but still weren't quite what you could call politically correct . By the way , there is one incredibly stupid continuity error that I fail to comprehend : in Part VI , the " Crystal Lake " area was renamed " Forest Green " . Now it's called " Crystal Lake " again ? [ Note the name on a road sign . ] What did they do , change the name back ? ! ! ? Despite its faults , it's a respectable series entry overall .
398857	1391795	83976	7.0	A fairly good little horror film .	Heather ( Lesleh Donaldson ) visits grandmother Maude ( Kay Hawtry ) , who's converted her late husbands ' funeral home into a motel . Heather helps Maude with assorted odd jobs , while falling for affable local young hunk Rick ( Dean Garbett ) . Meanwhile , some of Maudes ' guests are being murdered , there's a secret in the motels ' cellar , and eerie whispering can be heard in the night . Heather and Rick end up deciding to probe the mystery . If one is going to think of this movie as a slasher , it's definitely one of the old-school variety . The body count is pretty low , and the accent is much more on maintaining a solidly spooky tone and atmosphere than indulging in grisly violence . ( The films ' few victims aren't teenagers , either . ) The tone even becomes wistful at times , particularly as it pertains to Ruth , who really seems to live in the past . We even get a few flashbacks , showing differing perspectives on the character of the late grandfather . It doesn't work so well as a mystery , but there is a certain fun in getting to the reveal . The influence of " Psycho " does weigh very heavily on " Funeral Home " , but if one is going to borrow ideas , they might as well borrow from the best . ( One interesting touch is that the ultimate exposition is delivered not during the film , but over the closing credits . That's something I haven't seen before . ) Director William Fruet takes his film very seriously , and gives it a genuinely eerie quality , helped immensely by Jerry Fieldings ' excellent music , and early work by the reliable veteran cinematographer Mark Irwin . The very good cast includes Stephen Miller as the now-clichéd character of the " creepy " guy on the periphery of the action ( in this case , a handyman ) , Alf Humphreys ( who went on to play Howard in the slasher " My Bloody Valentine " ) as the young eager beaver deputy , guest star Barry Morse as Mr . Davis , Harvey Atkin as a randy and ill-fated salesman , and Jack Van Evera ( who also would appear in " My Bloody Valentine " , as " Happy " ) as the grandfather in the flashbacks . The incredibly lovely and appealing Donaldson , who had smaller roles in other early 80's genre fare as " Happy Birthday to Me " , " Curtains " , and " Deadly Eyes " , here gets her shot at being a legitimate lead , which she handles quite capably . It's overall an effective low-budget horror film that I think more people ought to check out . It does have its pluses .
398816	1391795	76023	8.0	Riveting from start to finish .	A gut-wrenching revenge thriller in which three criminals - unrepentant racist white guy Jessie Lee ( William Sanderson , in a scenery-chewing early role ) , Hispanic Chino ( Daniel Faraldo ) and Oriental Ling ( Peter Yoshida ) escape from a prison transport and end up inside the house of a black family headed by Ted Turner ( Robert Judd ) , a minister . The family endures a nonstop barrage of taunts , humiliation , and brutality ( not to mention a mind-boggling assortment of racial epithets ) before they finally get a chance to turn the tables . Writer Straw Weisman ( yeah , that really is his credited screen name ) and director Robert A . Endelson serve up an incredibly riveting exploitation favorite that holds absolutely nothing back . They know how to push all the right buttons here ; I dare a viewer not to get riled up to some degree watching this ! It's fascinating in a true can't-look-away fashion . Weisman and Endelson also take undeniably potent risks here in killing off a boy and don't even spare a baby from being threatened . It's well staged , and flows along quite quickly towards its inevitable final confrontation . By the time of the climax , it's all too easy to root for the Turner family to go for blood . Sanderson dominates the whole proceedings in a true force-of-nature performance , creating a memorable and compelling villain no matter how vile , bigoted , evil and degenerate he proves himself to be . The rest of the cast , consisting of much less recognizable folk ( although Reginald Bythewood , as Floyd , continued to act and eventually went on to write and direct as well ) , each do their job well ; the grandma ( Lela Small ) in particular stands out , as she refuses to ever let herself be intimidated . A relic of a time where film-makers could take the chance of exploiting political incorrectness ( something like this would never fly nowadays ) , " Fight for Your Life " is one hell of a guilty pleasure and a true marvel to watch . Other highlights : The family dog peeing on Sandersons ' face while he's out cold . A minor character conveniently getting her top yanked off , exposing her bouncing breasts , before being pitched over a waterfall to her death . Trash doesn't come much more gritty , nasty , and shameless than this . Providing you have a high tolerance level for offensive dialog and situations , you may find it quite worth your while .
398903	1391795	116629	8.0	Not Until The Fat Lady Sings !	Earth comes under attack by EXTREMELY hostile aliens who hover enormous spaceships over Earth's major cities and reduce them to rubble . The fate of mankind ends up resting in the hands of a diverse group of people : a pilot ( Will Smith ) , a computer genius ( Jeff Goldblum ) and none other than the President of the United States ( Bill Pullman ) . Some people may attack this movie and accuse it of being relentlessly stupid , to which I say LIGHTEN UP . Don't you know that if we all took every movie ever made seriously , we may end up hating most of them ? That's what I do . I don't take this kind of entertainment seriously . It is very entertaining , very long but very entertaining . It has truly remarkable special-effects sequences and a very interesting cast . It may be more drawn-out than it needs to be , but overall I think it's cool . I am probably more impressed by the sheer spectacle of the film than anything else , though . I rate the movie .
399465	1391795	66126	8.0	William Smith is the man .	A group of bikers is recruited by the military for a daring rescue operation during the Vietnam War . The trouble is , can these fun-loving hooligans stay focused long enough to complete the mission ? An Army captain does his best to supervise / babysit them . Directed with typical assured efficiency by action specialist Jack Starrett , this starts slow but still has some rather interesting and poignant moments to deliver . The climax is the best part , with plenty of well-staged stunts and special effects . The cast includes the fantastic veteran B movie he-man William Smith as the amiable yet all-business Link , Adam Roarke as the romantic Duke , Paul Koslo as the engaging Limpy , and Bernie Hamilton as the captain . Some unexpected developments pack a good punch . Screenwriter Alan Caillou , whose other credits include " Kingdom of the Spiders " , does a good job in showing the effect of the war on the region and the people . Provocative as well as visceral , this movie delivers good B-movie entertainment . It blends the biker and war genres into a satisfying mix .
399715	1391795	78295	8.0	Carpenters ' early and excellent foray into made-for-TV movies .	Leigh Michaels ( Lauren Hutton ) is the new director of live TV at a small time station who receives the attention of a frighteningly persistent psycho who continuously phones her . With her likable new love interest Paul Winkless ( David Birney ) and friendly co-worker Sophie ( Carpenters ' ex-wife and frequent performer Adrienne Barbeau ) to offer support , Leigh ultimately decides that she will have to take matters into her own hands . Carpenter had only had his debut " Dark Star " and " Assault on Precinct 13 " under his belt when taking the helm of this thriller . Mostly during the 1970's , he was a screenwriter for hire ( one example was the 1978 thriller " Eyes of Laura Mars " ) , but he proved to be up to the task of crafting this genuinely spooky and riveting story . Good jump scares and suspense sequences combine with good performances to make it a really entertaining film , showing that Carpenter could do solid work in the medium of television . It's well shot by Robert Hauser ( Carpenter had yet to form his partnership with ace cinematographer Dean Cundey ) and the music by Harry Sukman is excellent . Hutton is a likable and refreshingly loopy and neurotic heroine often given to talking to herself , at least in the early going . She even does her own potentially dangerous stunt at one point . Birney is very pleasant as her new boyfriend , and Barbeau very cute as the co-worker ; this was her first time working for Carpenter . In supporting roles , familiar faces like former Carpenter regular Charles Cyphers , James Murtaugh ( " The Howling " ) and Len Lesser ( ' Seinfeld ' ) can be seen . This marked a very busy period in Carpenters ' career , as he worked on this movie , filmed " Halloween " , and started work on ' Elvis ' all in the same year - very solid output over a short span of time . This is clearly not one of Carpenters ' better known works , but hopefully I and others can help to remedy that . It's now available on DVD and I hope that helps it to develop a larger audience . It's chilling and believable ( with a nice little nod to " Rear Window " at one point ) and a lot of fun .
399675	1391795	75809	8.0	An intense and gripping thriller .	A mysterious black Sedan appears in the desert outside the small town of Santa Ynez , New Mexico , and proceeds to mow down assorted townspeople . Stoic and reliable Sheriff Wade Parent ( a solid James Brolin ) and his men eventually realize something infinitely powerful is driving this demonic vehicle of death , and they unite in a frantic attempt to send it right back to Hell . Opening with a quote from Church of Satan founder Anton LaVey ( creative consultant on this movie ) , " The Car " perfectly creates a sense of fear . It begins on an ominous note , killing off two amiable bike-riding kids ( the girl played by future " The Young and the Restless " actress Melody Thomas Scott ) almost immediately . It's fun and exciting , but also quite bleak and despairing . It shows no mercy ( perhaps in deference to the evil nature of this vehicle , it kills off a bunch of nice folk while letting surly , repugnant wife-beater Amos ( R . G . Armstrong ) live and he even gets to help save the day during the climax ) . It's got some good shocks - rolling over two cop cars and destroying them without sustaining any serious damage itself , and crashing through a house to strike down a victim ) . It has both a good level of energy and some decent suspense . The characters are well delineated by a fine cast of familiar faces . Brolin is well supported by Kathleen Lloyd ( as Lauren , his new girlfriend who has the audacity to taunt and curse out the car ) , John Marley as Everett , Ronny Cox as Luke , the ineffectual deputy with a weakness for alcohol , and in a real treat , real-life sisters Kim and Kyle Richards together on screen as Brolin's daughters . The desolate desert landscape looks great thanks to Gerald Hirschfeld's Panavision cinematography . Leonard Rosenman's score is good and spooky , and the car P . o . V . shots add a nice , stylish touch . The movie should also get some credit for being fairly intense and creepy without falling back on graphic gore to make an impact . The movie also concludes on an impressively ambiguous final note . It's a fine thrill ride with a chilling overall air of relentless evil . That infernal honking of the car's horn becomes quite disconcerting especially when the car appears to celebrate each time a victim is claimed . I give it a strong recommendation .
399906	1391795	95583	8.0	Good B-movie junk from the 1980's !	Several innocent people in NYC get slaughtered by a mysterious figure dressed as a cop . Police officer Jack Forrest ( Bruce Campbell ) is conveniently singled out to be the prime suspect , while detective Frank McCrae ( Tom Atkins ) tries to identify the real culprit . Solid , chilling little movie is an enjoyable guilty pleasure ; a sleazy and amusing combination of a standard cop movie and a standard slasher movie . It features a number of reliable B-movie veterans , although it is really veteran actress Sheree North that stands out . Character actor Robert Z'Dar , who plays the movie's disfigured villain , happens to have been a real-life Chicago policeman himself . It's certainly cool to have Bruce " Don't call me Ash " Campbell as the hero . Some additional scenes have been added featuring Ken Lerner and Leo Rossi ( you can also see them in the films " Hit List " and " Relentless " , director William Lustig's next two pictures ) . Lustig features his uncle , legendary boxer Jake La Motta , in a cameo , and also look for a cameo from director Sam Raimi as the reporter at the parade . I have to admit that I liked it . Another trivia note : after calling it quits as a director , Lustig went to work for Anchor Bay Entertainment , procuring titles and producing documentary shorts and DVD packages . He then went on to form his own company , " Blue Underground " , a company that specializes in bringing cult films to DVD . I was reasonably impressed to find that out . Followed by two sequels .
399070	1391795	54777	8.0	A fine werewolf tale from Hammer .	Based on the novel " The Werewolf of Paris " by Guy Endore but set in Spain , this effective little story starts with a beggar being imprisoned by a nasty nobleman . This poor soul turns feral after many years of confinement and ends up raping a mute servant girl before expiring . The girl gives birth to a son on Christmas day , which only results in tragedy : according to superstition , unwanted children born on this day are cursed . As the boy grows up , the curse comes to fruition , as he turns into a fanged and hairy beast during the full moon . A heartfelt , tragic story as the best werewolf stories often tend to be , the great Hammer Studios give this film a solid production . It's a visually rich picture shot in beautiful color , and it offers some moody and atmospheric sequences . Terence Fisher does a fine job of directing , as always , holding off the reveal of the werewolf as long as possible , and delivering a striking climax . The proliferation of British accents in a story set in Spain is distracting , although never unbearably so . The acting is the best component . Oliver Reed is quite believable as Leon , the agitated and desperate and , most importantly , very likable victim . An extremely impressive supporting cast includes Clifford Evans , Yvonne Romain , Catherine Feller , Anthony Dawson , Richard Wordsworth , Hira Talfrey , Justin Walters , John Gabriel , Warren Mitchell , and Michael Ripper . Dawson in particular amused me as the cruel and depraved Marques Siniestro , with Walters quite adorable in the role of Leon as a child . It's too bad Hammer never made another werewolf film ; they did excellent work with this one .
398853	1391795	76191	8.0	The real star of the movie is obviously Rick Baker .	Astronaut Steve West ( Alex Rebar ) and his comrades undertake a space mission that sees them flying through the rings of Saturn . His comrades are killed instantly , but it would seem that they are in fact the lucky ones . Steve returns to Earth a constantly oozing mass of humanoid pulp ; as he turns into a savage killer , melting every step of the way , he is tracked by his friend , Dr . Ted Nelson ( Burr DeBenning ) . This is often so uproariously funny - with enough absurd lines and situations to go around - that it's hard for me to believe that the laughs are all unintentional . It seems to me to be kind of a goof on low-budget genre efforts from the ' 50's and 60's , and as such , it's a marvelously entertaining movie . That sequence with the nurse is simply hilarious . We're even treated to a split screen sequence that doesn't really add anything , but is still a gas to watch . Writer / director William Sachs deserves credit for coming up with this ingenious idea ; his ultra-slimy character is a memorable one indeed . I think his pacing is a little off ; some scenes ( like the one with the elderly couple ) go on a little long , but ultimately he delivers solid , schlocky , B-movie goods with a degree of panache . The climax is especially fun . Arlon Obers ' music is enjoyably shuddery ( yet also amusingly silly during some moments ) , and Willy Curtis's cinematography creates some really great shots at times . That brings me to Rick Bakers ' fantastic and convincing makeup effects , which form a highly respectable centerpiece for the movie , right down to the ultimate final melt . Rebar is under the heavy makeup for almost the entire movie ( Sachs also gets my praise for having the movie hit the ground running ) and does what he has to do well enough . DeBenning makes for a rather oafish and silly hero , and Ann Sweeney isn't so hot either as his wife , but Myron Healey , Michael Alldredge , and Lisle Wilson are fine in support . It's also worth it to see folk like Cheryl " Rainbeaux " Smith ( doing an appreciable topless shot ) , Janus Blythe ( of Tobe Hoopers ' " Eaten Alive " and Wes Cravens ' " The Hills Have Eyes " ) , and even director Jonathan Demme in a bit part . This is a highly entertaining midnight movie with enough gore , chills , and laughs to rate it as worth catching for lovers of low-grade sci-fi / horror everywhere .
398735	1391795	93560	8.0	Very likable and funny horror for a younger audience .	Entertaining PG-13 extravaganza for the kid in all of us . Dracula ( a dapper Duncan Regehr ) materializes in modern times , rounding up other such horror movie icons as The Mummy , The Wolf Man , The Gill Man , and Frankensteins ' monster ( Tom Noonan ) . Dracula is in search of a special amulet and needs his fellow creatures ' assistance in pursuit of his goal . However , he didn't count on the title group - a rambunctious group of pre-teens who have devoted themselves to the horror genre . Would I say that this is all that good ? Not really , but there's just something very endearing about it , especially if you yourself became a horror junkie at a reasonably young age , as I did . It's full of some truly hysterical jargon that had me laughing out loud : " dweeb " , " feeb " , " jerkoid " , etc . I didn't take this too seriously , and I had fun with it . The young cast is nicely exuberant , adding to the overall good vibes that the movie provides . ( Ashley Bank as Phoebe and Michael Faustino as Eugene are just adorable . ) The adult co-stars , while largely in the background , offer some solid support , with Stephen Macht as the Squad leaders ' ( Andre Gower ) detective dad , Mary Ellen Trainor as his mom , Jon Gries as the Wolf Man's human alter ego , Stan Shaw as the detectives ' partner , David Proval as a pilot , and two guys in particular who are wonderful and steal the show : the afore-mentioned Noonan , and Leonardo Cimino as Scary German Guy ( that is one of the funniest character names that I've heard in a while ) . Stan Winston and his team crafted the genuinely cool-looking creature characters , and Richard Edlund and his Boss Film Corporation provided the razzle-dazzle special effects . Bruce Broughton also gives the movie an appropriate music score . Filmed in the wider-than-usual Panavision aspect ratio , the picture looks pretty good overall . A lively , affable ode to vintage horror , made from a childs ' wide-eyed perspective , " The Monster Squad " may come off as too lame for some peoples ' tastes , but it's a real hoot for those who remember what it was like to enjoy the horror genre as youths . Oh . . . and the " Wolf Man's got nards " moment is hysterical . I thought that this was really cute , and really amusing . I wouldn't call it bland at all .
399780	1391795	116367	8.0	" This is my kind of place ! "	Foul-mouthed , hot-tempered criminal Seth Gecko ( George Clooney ) and his disgusting , idiotic brother Richie ( played by writer Quentin Tarantino ) leave a trail of bodies in their wake as they head for Mexico . They take a vacationing family ( Harvey Keitel , Juliette Lewis , Ernest Liu ) hostage and arrive at their intended rendezvous point : a phenomenally seedy , sleazy bar called " The Titty Twister . " Before long , they have learned the truth about the bar : all the staff are vampires who regularly prey on the customers . While the excesses of this movie are too much for conservative folk ( and especially film critics ) , this action-packed , spectacularly gory movie was fun for me ; it's like being in an intense , gruesome haunted house ride . The cast is enjoyable ; it's particularly noteworthy that Tarantino and director / editor Robert Rodriguez chose an interesting , off-the-wall collection of performers , including former " blaxploitation " star Fred Williamson , makeup effects expert Tom Savini ( as a biker named " Sex Machine " ! ) , and veteran movie heavy Marc Lawrence . It also provides an amusing showcase for Cheech Marin , who plays three small roles . The visual / makeup / creature effects design is impressive , although I must repeat that this movie is more for hardcore horror fans and some of you may find it repulsive ( and pointless ) . However , I say good job ! I give it !
399170	1391795	63456	8.0	A solid little thriller .	Dennis Pitt ( Anthony Perkins ) , a pathetic , eccentric young man being released from a mental institution after a long ago arson , is prone to fantasizing . When he spies luscious high school student Sue Ann Stepanek ( Tuesday Weld ) , he worms his way into her life by concocting an elaborate story about being a CIA agent . The lovely young lady seems a little too easily intrigued , willing to play along at every turn . Eventually , she reveals a disturbing true nature , and it's too late for the meek-hearted Dennis to back out . Weld offers a true standout performance while Perkins gets to do a bit of a variation on his infamous Norman Bates role . The two of them work well together , creating a great dynamic . Beverly Garland and John Randolph are also excellent in supporting roles . It's a highly amusing and offbeat and twisty movie , moving along very well and always maintaining interest . It's as unpredictable as Welds ' memorable character . That said , it really kicks into gear once Sue Ann starts taking over and Dennis is merely plodding along in her wake . The picturesque small town locale is a nice setting ; the cinematography is superb . It's a likable and engrossing film that does , indeed , deserve to be better known . I highly recommend it .
399565	1391795	70294	8.0	Well-wrought ghost story .	Four people , including parapsychologist Dr . Lionel Barrett ( Clive Revill ) and his wife Ann ( Gayle Hunnicutt ) , mental medium Florence Tanner ( Pamela Franklin ) and physical medium Ben Fischer ( Roddy McDowall ) investigate the psychic phenomena of a sprawling mansion with the expected skeletons in its closet . Adapted by Richard Matheson from his own novel , " The Legend of Hell House " is a skillfully orchestrated and acted horror drama with good performances and a subtle , menacing music score . It may not leave quite as much to the imagination as , say , the 1963 film version of Shirley Jackson's " The Haunting of Hill House " , but it doesn't go overboard , either . The effects are limited and are good and believable . The comparisons to " The Haunting " will be , I suppose , rather inevitable , but this film can stand on its own . This film introduces a scientific approach to the investigation rather than a scholarly one . Roddy McDowall contributes a standout performance in this exemplary cast ; there is a cameo appearance by a familiar face at the very end ( which , by the way , is rather low-key , flying in the face of horror films that usually demand some sort of frenetic conclusion ) . This is a good film , good enough to make me want to read the Matheson novel eventually . Director John Hough considers this to be one of his very best films , right up there with 1974's " Dirty Mary Crazy Larry " ( this is mentioned in the DVD commentary for the latter film ) .
399923	1391795	76127	8.0	Solid low-budget psychological horror that just oozes menace .	In a small rural community , a series of graphic murders - the murder weapon in this case is a pair of scissors - is baffling the police and terrifying the citizens . Forlorn farm woman Ingrid ( May Britt ) , who clearly has had a traumatic incident in her past , Ingrids ' uncle Carl ( Cameron Mitchell ) , and the local sheriff ( Aldo Ray ) are among those caught up in the nightmare . Writers Anne Marisse and Herb Freed ( Freed also co-produced and directed ) certainly have the right name for their movie . " Haunting " would be one apt word to use to describe this . The picture has a palpable sense of nasty and gloomy atmosphere that begins immediately and holds up right to the conclusion . The murders are graphic , and there's no shortage of suspects . It's overall a bizarre and extremely twisty movie that ultimately doesn't lead to any predictable finish ; Marisse and Freed came up with quite the plot indeed , with some remarkable revelations that don't stop coming until the end credits start rolling . The music by the ever reliable Pino Donaggio is beautifully eerie . The small town setting is incredibly well utilized by the film-makers and the rather murky photography simply adds to the gloomy feeling throughout . The acting is generally very good , especially by Britt , Mitchell , and Ray . While I have to wonder if the plot would hold up to close scrutiny , it still did a great job of reeling me in and maintaining my interest . Overall , this is a well realized , genuinely spooky low-budget horror film that's worth checking out . I'm certainly glad that I did . Freed went on to direct the horror features " Beyond Evil " and " Graduation Day " .
398896	1391795	68364	8.0	A lewd and likable lowbrow comedy .	This sexploitation comedy is just so upbeat and blatantly comedic it's hard to resist . The title girls have lives that pretty much revolve around sex . A new member of their team , Jeannie ( nude model Stephanie Fondue ) is a wallflower who is recruited because it isn't believed she'll get into the same trouble as the girl she's replacing ( i . e . pregnancy ) . However , her teammates vow to help her lose her virginity ! Paul Glickler supplies these amiable antics with pretty freewheeling direction . He gives all interested viewers exactly what they could hope for : lots of sex and lots of nudity . The girls are a very attractive bunch and look extremely good sans clothes . It's all appreciably raunchy and there's no pretense at following any sort of real plot . It's just about having a good time . All sexual encounters and escapades are played not just for prime titillation but full comedic potential . One of the funniest highlights is a wild bus ride . It includes so many freeze frames that one watching this on DVD may think their disc is skipping ! There are also hilarious uses of wipes . The dialog is absolutely priceless , and often involves rhyming : " I'm wise to the rise in your Levi's " and " Don't get your liver in a quiver " . The music is quite catchy , to boot . And everybody looks like they're having fun , regardless of the lack of actual " acting " . " The Cheerleaders " is agreeable trash from its spirited beginning to its raucous end .
398747	1391795	120042	8.0	An excellent thriller that deserves to be better known .	Carl ( Bruce Campbell ) is just being released from prison , but he's already got plans for a major heist . Due to the bumbling of his none-too-reliable partner Patrick ( Jeremy Roberts ) , things unravel pretty quickly as one thing after another goes wrong . Drawing inspiration from Alfred Hitchcocks ' classic movie " Rope " , this well-crafted movie appears to unfold in real time and be shot in one continuous take . This creates a constant flow of action , and allows a viewer to feel as if they are right there with the characters . There are no extraneous subplots ; it's a simple story , well told and very well acted by its principal actors . It clocks in at a breezy 69 minutes and also has a nice feel of realism . Sharp black and white cinematography ( by Kurt Rauf ) and agile camera-work ( by Bill Gierhart ) and entertaining music ( by Joseph LoDuca ) are very worthy assets . The cast is convincing and riveting ; B-movie icon Campbell is a great lead , well supported by Roberts as the well-meaning but ineffectual Patrick , Anita Barone as a wonderfully appealing nice-girl prostitute ( and former flame of Campbell ! ) , Stan Davis as safe-cracker Buzz , Gordon Jennison as pathetic and untrustworthy junkie getaway driver Donny , and excellent character veteran Art LaFleur as the prison warden . Trust me , this little movie will get your attention and keep you interested . It's solid entertainment - sometimes funny , sometimes harrowing , and sometimes even touching . I highly recommend it .
398738	1391795	107504	8.0	Does he bite ? You bet he does .	Ally Sheedy portrays Lori Tanner , a TV news reporter itching to break out of fluff stories and do something worthwhile . She gets her big break in discovering the atrocities visited on animals in bad guy scientist Dr . Jarrets ' ( Lance Henriksen ) vivisection lab . Unfortunately , she's also the unwitting instigator of the movie's main story by letting loose Dr . Jarrets ' pet project , Max , a mutt genetically engineered to have the abilities of several different types of animals . Max is also inherently dangerous , wouldn't you know ; once his sedatives wear off , his violent side will take over . This may not be all that good a movie , but as a dog lover and a genre fan who's not overtly demanding , I thought it made for some pretty good entertainment . It zips along , and maintains a level of interest and involvement . Max is an endearing canine co-star , well trained by a handful of animal experts , including canine specialist Clint Rowe . Makeup effects are suitably gory , the music is affecting , and the film delivers some good action and suspense scenes . Sheedy is an appropriately likable protagonist , and Henriksen reliable as always as the unsubtle , one-dimensional villain . Robert Costanzo , John Cassini , Fredric Lehne , and excellent character veteran William Sanderson all do a good job in support . It's a fairly amusing movie that puts morbid spins on the usual clichés associated with dogs , like the dog not caring for the significant other of its owner , or tussles with cats , mailmen , dogcatchers , and the like . It's good for some shocks and some chuckles , and , even if you don't find yourself caring for it too much , it's over fairly quickly . I thought it was fun escapism , although the movies ' plea for animal rights certainly doesn't escape ones ' attention . However , it doesn't detract from a basically decent thriller .
399130	1391795	80707	8.0	A nicely sleazy and sordid vigilante picture .	A memorably tough , nasty , and supremely gritty NYC vigilante action favorite obviously patterned after " Death Wish " , this flick stars Robert Ginty as John Eastland , Vietnam veteran working with his fellow former soldier Michael Jefferson ( Steve James ) in a market . Michael doesn't last long before he is targeted by gang members who attack him and paralyze him for life . This motivates John to do something about the level of crime in The City . He's not content , however , to stop with the gang members . He wages a full-scale war against the criminal element , while Detective James Dalton ( Christopher George ) is on his trail . This film really wastes no time . It starts with some very well-staged and hellish Vietnam scenes , the highlight of which is a brutal decapitation ( Tom Burman and Stan Winston supply the makeup effects ) . Writer / director James Glickenhaus compensates for a lack of originality by infusing his film with a relentless seediness and memorable set pieces . One of the absolute best moments has a mafioso getting fed into a meat grinder . A creepy sequence has John going after a " chicken pimp " whose primary business is supplying depraved johns with underage boys . But in the tradition of vigilante leads such as Charles Bronson's Paul Kersey in " Death Wish " , John will always turn up to punish criminal scum in the most visceral manner possible . Excellent location shooting ( as well as some great overhead shots of The City ) is a big plus , as well as some effectively melancholy songs on the soundtrack . Ginty is fine in the lead , with the ever engaging George a good choice for the role of the detective ; Samantha Eggar has a relatively minor role as an emerging love interest for George . The always charismatic James is fun to watch in his brief screen time , with some familiar faces such as Tony DiBenedetto , Dennis Boutsikaris , George Cheung , Irwin Keyes , and Tom Everett in bit parts . " The Exterminator " comes as a strong recommendation for fans of exploitation and action .
399148	1391795	100661	8.0	The idea of David Carradine in drag is just one element of this unique bit of cinema .	What we have here is a twisted allegory of child abuse and its lingering after effects in which Paul L . Smith plays the big shot / crime boss of a small rural town . David Carradine plays Pearl , his transvestite partner . The movie kicks off when Weasel ( an aptly named role for the oft-intense Brad Dourif ) , Smiths ' henchman , murders a young couple and steals their car for delivery to Slue ( Smith ) . However , there happens to be a baby in the back seat . Slue is furious and wants nothing to do with a child at first , until he realizes that he can torture this child to his hearts ' content and turn him into his attack dog . The interesting cast is just one draw of this terminally offbeat cult item . It also features Michael Griffin , as the young adult incarnation of Sonny Boy , who does a remarkable job in a difficult role . Alexandra Powers plays a potential romantic interest , Conrad Janis an alcoholic local doctor who supposedly conducts transplants using monkey parts , and Sydney Lassick ( it's cool that this movie re-unites two cast members of " One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest " , him and Dourif ) as a criminal accomplice . The rural locations ( this was filmed on location in New Mexico ) are well photographed and art direction / set decoration are also done well . It's set to some rather nice , flavorful music by Carlo Maria Cordio and moves along fairly well . Graeme Whiflers ' script is full of both humor and pathos . While this movie may inevitably be off-putting to some folk , it makes a strong condemnation of the horrors of child abuse in the context of a wild dark comedy / drama . I haven't seen anything quite like " Sonny Boy " , and that's definitely a good thing . What would one compare it to ? Carradine really goes the extra mile here ; not only does he act , but he came up with the theme song as well !
399089	1391795	80661	8.0	A career highlight for Brian De Palma .	Psychotic transsexual Bobbi murders the patient ( Angie Dickinson ) of a prominent doctor ( Michael Caine ) and then pursues the high-priced prostitute ( Nancy Allen ) who caught a glimpse of Bobbi in the elevator . Liz ( Allen ) comes under suspicion of the crime and teams up with the patient's son ( Keith Gordon ) to catch the killer . It can be summed up in a couple of words : it's very sexy ( Dickinson and Allen look great ) , it's very bloody - with the kind of gore usually reserved for splatter movies , and boy is it well crafted . Writer / director De Palma's script is OK but it really takes a backseat to the man's film-making abilities . It is highly successful on a visceral level and I actually get involved / interested with these characters . I can notice the standard De Palma homages to / ripoffs of Hitchcock - at least from one of the Master's pictures . And to top it all off , it has a professional and believable cast . This was De Palma's third movie with ex-wife Nancy Allen ( after " Carrie " and " Home Movies " . ) By the way , dancer-turned-actress Rachel Ticotin was one of the production assistants . There's a bit of trivia for you . I wouldn't think a thriller could be classy and bloody at the same time but this picture pulls it off . One of the best things about it is a typically striking Pino Donaggio music score .
398769	1391795	82951	8.0	A truly potent and sadistic slasher .	This atmospheric , dark , and incredibly horrific slasher begins in a way unlike others of its kind . It shows vintage newsreel footage of WWII soldiers returning home , and then we cut to the reading of a letter wherein the girlfriend of one of these soldiers has written him saying that she could no longer wait for him . He of course doesn't take kindly to this . She and her date get a pitchfork rammed through them during the night of a graduation dance . Years go by without a graduation dance , until 35 years later when it starts up again . ( This plot twist makes " The Prowler " rather similar to " My Bloody Valentine " ) . This doesn't sit well with the killer and he resumes his murderous ways in the current day . Certain horror films can appeal to me the more that I watch them . " The Prowler " is one of those . It's not that it stands out all that much from typical stalk ' n ' slash fare , but director / co-producer Joseph Zito maintains a truly ominous mood right from the get-go . While the pacing lags at times ( when Zito goes for straight suspense , he drags the scenes out a little too long ) , it's overall a menacing flick with a truly creepy killer , dressed head to foot in army fatigues . The main reason to watch it is for some of the nastiest , most convincing , and cold-blooded splatter that Tom Savini has ever come up with . He delivers a series of highlights : a knife rammed through a skull , a pitchforking in a shower , a brutal throat slashing in a pool , and , to put the perfect capper on the whole thing , a head that blows up real good . " The Prowler " also doles out some tasty servings of female nudity . Leads Christopher Goutman and Vicky Dawson are okay if unremarkable in the leads , although it must be said that she is one very pretty and appealing performer . The supporting cast includes such people as Cindy Weintraub ( " Humanoids from the Deep " ) , Thom Bray ( ' Riptide ' , " Prince of Darkness " , " The Horror Show " ) , Lisa Dunsheath ( " Eddie Macon's Run " , " They All Laughed " ) , busy character actor John Seitz , and Bryan Englund ( " Crazy Mama " ) , son of Cloris Leachman who sadly made his last feature film appearance here . Popping up in brief roles are Hollywood legends Farley Granger ( " Strangers on a Train " ) as the Sheriff and a very under-utilized Lawrence Tierney ( " Dillinger " ' 45 , " Reservoir Dogs " ) . Although in retrospect the mystery to be solved is a little too easy to figure out , " The Prowler " still works as one hell of a savage and scary slasher , getting a lot out of its filming location of the community of Cape May in New Jersey . In a very interesting bit of trivia , co-writer Neal Barbera is the son of legendary animator Joseph Barbera of Hanna-Barbera fame !
399326	1391795	85333	8.0	" Watch what you call my car . . . she's real sensitive . "	Back in 1983 , Stephen King was such a popular author that this film adaptation went into production before the book was even published . King had been satisfied enough with producer Richard Kobritz's TV miniseries adaptation of his novel " Salem's Lot " to send him a few manuscripts . One was " Cujo " , another was " Christine " . Kobritz decided he liked the latter more , and pursued it as a film project . Accomplished film-maker John Carpenter , who at the time was still suffering the effects of the critical and commercial failure of his previous film , " The Thing " , agreed to take the helm , and Bill Phillips was hired to write the screenplay . Phillips eliminated much of the material of the novel ( especially the central character of the malevolent spirit Roland D . LeBay ) and both he and Carpenter agreed to more or less focus the film on Christine herself . In the film , Christine is possessed with a murderous , vengeful personality , seemingly for no reason at all . She is simply as evil as an inanimate object can get . Before she even comes off the assembly line , she's injured one man and killed another . Eventually , she comes into the life of hopeless high school nerd Arnie Cunningham ( Keith Gordon , in his first top-billed role , and offering a dramatic tour de force ) and helps to transform him from pathetic dweeb to dangerous 1950's style rebel - complete with 1950's style wardrobe . As the car sets about methodically eliminating most of the characters who cause Arnie grief , Arnie's loyal , level-headed jock friend Dennis Guilder ( John Stockwell ) and beautiful , would-be girlfriend Leigh Cabot ( Alexandra Paul ) try their darnedest to save Arnie and get rid of the car once and for all . While I myself found this movie to be rather lacking in terms of scares , suspense , and atmosphere , it's still a pleasantly well-crafted and stylish film . Carpenter contributes another of his marvelous electronic scores , and the film is peppered with vintage rock ' n ' roll songs . Approximately 25 different cars were used for the film - many of them ended up completely destroyed - and the special effects are admirable , especially in all scenes where Christine is repairing herself . One standout scene has Christine pursuing pudgy thug Moochie Welch ( Malcolm Danare ) into an exceptionally narrow loading dock , and then SQUEEZING herself inside so she can annihilate him . The wonderful cast is a heavy asset . Stockwell and Paul were certainly okay , but even better are the familiar faces in the character parts - Roberts Blossom as George LeBay , Robert Prosky as Will Darnell , and Harry Dean Stanton as Detective Rudolph Junkins . Kelly Preston appears in an early role . Bill Ostrander , as lead bully Buddy Repperton , has always struck me as a great casting choice ( Gordon and Carpenter remark in the DVD commentary that he seems to be partly channeling John Travolta in his performance - appropriate , because the film takes place in 1978 , when Travolta was experiencing his original bout of stardom ) , because he looks EXACTLY like I'd always imagined Buddy Repperton would look when I visualized the action while reading the novel . Here's an interesting thing to take note of : the actors playing Arnie's rather unlikable parents are named CHRISTINE Belford and Robert DARNELL . Just coincidence ? I myself don't know . Like I said , I don't really find it to be all that scary but it certainly offers a fair amount of fun . It's not a top-drawer King adaptation but it's definitely not one of the worst ones either .
399677	1391795	94056	8.0	Morgan Freeman really makes this a must-see .	The late Christopher Reeve stars as Jonathan Fisher , an investigative reporter who tries to tackle the story of a pimp's day-to-day life . Caving in to the pressure of an impending deadline , he comes up with a fictional story . The unfortunate side effect of this fabrication is that the assistant district attorney ( Jay Patterson ) is convinced that he's telling the story of a real-life pimp , " Fast Black " ( Morgan Freeman , in his breakout , Academy Award-nominated performance ) , who's being prosecuted for murder . The Cannon Group made its fair share of entertaining thrillers , and action , horror , and sci-fi movies during the 1980's , but this has to stand as one of their more interesting efforts . It's a pretty good story ( written by David Freeman ) , consistently entertaining and easy to watch . Ultimately , it does a good job of portraying a seamy side of life , while contrasting that with the kind of high society that wouldn't ordinarily connect with it . And the fact that Fisher is not so different from " Fast Black " certainly comes across ; the movie does have something to say about the way that certain types in the news business conduct themselves , and the potential repercussions of their actions . I think that Reeve does a decent enough job in the lead , although it's definitely true that his co-stars fare much better . Kathy Baker is wonderfully appealing ( and sexy ) as Punchy , one of " Fast Black " ' s girls ; she shines in all of her scenes , especially when she's relating to Fisher the comedic account of her first ever trick . But Freeman emerges as the real star of the movie . In a role far removed from the calm , authoritative , and wise persona that has been his stock in trade in the years since , he shows his true range , portraying a cunning , ruthless and also intelligent criminal who can come off as genial and welcoming and then turn on a dime and reveal the ugly side lying underneath the smooth exterior . Mimi Rogers , Andre Gregory , Anna Maria Horsford , and Erik King co-star , with each of them delivering good performances as well . " Street Smart " is a solid movie with a good premise and presentation , enjoyable soundtrack , and some mighty fine moments , especially one involving Freeman , Baker , and a pair of scissors .
399851	1391795	71431	8.0	A fine film of its kind .	Reluctant traveling companions George ( Ray Lovelock ) and Edna ( Christine Galbo ) get caught up in a proliferation of recently deceased folks rising to stalk the living . It would seem that a revolutionary new agricultural machine using radiation to eliminate insect pests is responsible . The local police inspector ( Arthur Kennedy ) , an exceptionally grumpy and cynical type , refuses to believe them and , going on Georges ' hippie-ish appearance alone , is more inclined to believe that George and Edna are responsible . While Jorge Graus ' " Let Sleeping Corpses Lie " ( also known by numerous other titles ) doesn't pile on zombie carnage , it's what the director does with the atmosphere that matters . A stark , moody , ominous mood is established almost from the get-go , with the overcast skies of Britain ( where the story is set ) helping immensely in this regard . It's a nicely creepy story with lots of sequences shot in almost complete darkness , and such hair-raising moments as an attempted escape from a tomb . Released just a few years after George Romeros ' original zombie classic , " Night of the Living Dead " , this film does up the ante in terms of on-screen violence . There's a fair bit of blood spurting and gut munching to enjoy here for fans of gore . The dismemberment of the hospital receptionist is particularly juicy . The picture moves at a fairly deliberate pace , slowly setting up what proves to be a magnificent finale indeed , and a highly enjoyable " last minute surprise " type ending . Lovelock and the stunning Galbo are engaging leads , with Kennedy turning in a solid performance as the hostile Inspector and Fernando Hilbeck , with his distinctive mug , doing a nice turn as the most prominent zombie of the picture . A chilling little Spanish-Italian co-production with a nice British feel to it , " Let Sleeping Corpses Lie " delivers its shocks and scares with skill and conviction . It's a good little zombie gem that merits attention and admiration .
399530	1391795	71424	8.0	Fun , breezy , landmark 1970's action film .	This quintessential drive-in classic from 1974 has a hotshot racer ( Peter Fonda ) and his trusted mechanic / sidekick ( Adam Roarke ) stage a daring supermarket robbery . Almost from the outset they acquire an unwanted companion in a one night stand of Fonda's ( Susan George ) who isn't about to be just blown off and quite simply attaches herself to them . They spend the balance of the picture evading a very determined lawman ( Vic Morrow ) , who tries to track them from a helicopter . This is made for anybody who loves their action loud and hard and their cars just as cool as can be . The film also takes the unconventional route of giving us anti-heroic , anti-authority troublemakers who aren't necessarily likable . The banter between Fonda and George flies back and forth , with him addressing her such endearing nicknames as " dingleberry " and " supercrotch " , with Roarke essentially playing the most low-key and level-headed of the three of them . Morrow's relentless cop isn't necessarily a good guy , either , and he's very intense in the role . The late , great Kenneth Tobey has a few scenes as Morrow's bureaucratic boss , and an oddly cast and uncredited Roddy McDowall does fine as the supermarket manager . " Dirty Mary Crazy Larry " is one of the more noteworthy examples of its genre , with the whole film basically adopting an anti-authoritarian , devil-may-care attitude . It's a lively affair with some good chases , in particular a harrowing showdown between a Dodge Charger and the helicopter . The film ends in one of the most daringly downbeat and abrupt final scenes one is likely to find in exploitation fare . It's quite memorable , and adds a real dramatic punctuation to the film . A must for any fan of 1970's drive-in pictures , and a career highlight for its Brit director , John Hough , also at the helm of one of the more interesting horror pictures of the 1970's , " The Legend of Hell House " , which incidentally also features Roddy McDowall .
399000	1391795	265459	8.0	" One Hour Photo " is a very good film !	Seymour " Sy " Parrish ( Robin Williams ) is a pathetically lonely guy , a photo shop employee at a Sav Mart whose job seems to be his basic reason for living . He obsesses over one set of customers , the Yorkin family ( Connie Nielsen , Michael Vartan , Dylan Smith ) whom he thinks of as a perfect family and he even imagines himself as one of their kin . Things go from creepy to outright dangerous when Sy's boss discovers his litany of transgressions and fires him , sending Sy over the edge . " One Hour Photo " is a refreshingly subtle and genuinely creepy drama / thriller that does not subscribe to any thriller formulas . Writer / director Mark Romanek has fashioned a movie that got under my skin and generated real uneasiness as I waited for Sy to lose it . The movie also features a shocking nightmare sequence sure to get your attention ( it actually seems more appropriate for a horror film , yet doesn't hurt the overall impact of the film ) . Best of all is William's restrained and efficient performance , which anchors the film . Supporting cast is fine , too . All in all , it's nice to see a good film like this come out of Hollywood every once in a while . One more word about Williams : I do tend to get tired of his comic persona , and find that he delivers his best actual performances when he's required to get serious . This is definitely one of the better things that he's done .
399719	1391795	81230	8.0	Lurid , exciting NYC thriller .	Aggrieved psycho Gus Soltic ( Cliff Gorman ) intends to kidnap a poor little rich girl for ransom . The only problem is , he nabs the wrong girl , the daughter of ex-cop turned trucker Sean Boyd ( James Brolin ) . Boyd then tears the City from top to bottom in the quest to get his daughter back . For one thing , this entertaining chase movie has a good cast . Brolin ain't exactly a squeaky clean Dudley Do Right type of hero . As you can see from watching this , he's pretty relentless . Brolin delivers an intense performance matched by the greasy sleaziness of Gorman . Richard Castellano of " The Godfather " is a pursuing detective , Linda Miller the hysterical ex-wife , Barton Heyman an asthmatic preacher , Julie Carmen a helpful dog pound employee , Dan Hedaya a hostile and resentful cop who hates Brolins ' guts , Mandy Patinkin a chatty , excitable cabbie who lends a hand early on in the film , Marco St . John a pompous , arrogant fat cat , and Abby Bluestone the imperiled daughter . Other familiar faces can be seen in smaller roles . Like other films from the same era , " Night of the Juggler " ( silly title , that , that barely gets an explanation ) captures the then wonderfully seedy ambiance of NYC . The location shooting is excellent . Directed with great force by Robert Butler , this picture moves at a high pace , with plenty of stunt-packed action sequences . ( Stunt coordinator Chris Howell even enlists his own son , actor C . Thomas Howell , as one of the stunt performers ! ) One thing's for sure : taking everything into consideration , the picture certainly isn't at any time ever boring . It offers a rather murky climax that unfortunately isn't as ultimately satisfying as I would have liked , but at least Butler keeps the level of tension high . It's a gritty little movie that could use a little more exposure , so a DVD release would certainly help in that regard .

Wilson ( Erica Gavin ) is nabbed by the cops and sent to prison in this slick and amusing example of prime 70's exploitation , marking the directing debut of Jonathan Demme . After writing and producing a few of mentor Roger Cormans ' New World films , Demme was afforded the opportunity to direct for the first time , and he delivers a movie that not only delivers the expected and tasty doses of nudity and violence , but has an appealing tongue-in-cheek quality to it as well ; it's often as funny as it is flashy . Standout scenes include a lewd and crude vaudeville style act performed for the prisoners , as well as a potent dream / fantasy sequence for uptight and obviously very repressed Superintendent McQueen ( horror icon Barbara Steele , doing a marvelous turn in this antagonistic role ) . I also enjoyed a bank robbery scene gone haywire and a carjacking scene that was simply uproarious . As in other movies of this kind , it's also commendable that it's as much a portrait of female empowerment as it is pure exploitation . These women are tough , they take no garbage from anybody , and they're more than capable of handling themselves . Our attractive cast here makes the most of their roles : Juanita Brown as the aggressive Maggie , Roberta Collins as the sassy Belle , Rainbeaux Smith as the cute and timid Lavelle , Gavin as the wide-eyed newcomer , and Lynda Gold ( a . k . a . Crystin Sinclaire ) in a bright appearance as an accomplice on the outside . As our climax plays out , Demme comes up with a tense " beat the clock " finish as our heroines race to save Belle from being lobotomized by predatory Dr . Randolph ( Warren Miller ) , the type of man who thinks nothing of taking advantage of women . Bouncing along to John Cales ' flavorful score , " Caged Heat " is upbeat entertainment and a guaranteed good time .
398850	1391795	86541	8.0	" Long live the new flesh . "	James Woods plays Max Renn , a programmer of pirated cable TV that shows things ranging from soft-core porno to hard-core violence . He finds out about a bizarre piece of snuff TV called " Videodrome " that wallows in depravity by showing torture and murder non-stop . The REAL down side to this program is that it causes hallucinations , and alters human bodies in disgusting ways . An earlier David Cronenberg venture into typically creepy , intense territory , enhanced by some good performances ( especially from Woods ) and another good Howard Shore music score . It doesn't do too badly as a statement on the effect of television and other media on human lives ( going so far as to say that they actually change us in physical ways ) . Best of all are Rick Baker's eye-catching visual and makeup effects - sometimes really gruesome , but pulled off really well ( I love the pulsating TV and videotape , and the gun that fuses itself into Woods ' hand and arm . Biggest highlight is a graphic death scene ) . " Videodrome " probably won't become one of my favorite Cronenberg films , but I think that it's just fine and I had a good time watching it . Not exactly a favorite of the critics , but that's fine by me . I know what I like , and I happen to like " Videodrome " .
399032	1391795	92563	8.0	Engrossing , solid mystery .	Harry Angel ( Mickey Rourke ) is a low-rent NYC private eye hired by mystery man Louis Cyphre ( Robert De Niro ) to locate " Johnny Favorite " , a pre-war crooner who's dropped out of sight . Harry's search will take him to various NYC and New Orleans locations , and involve the practice of voodoo . While I have to admit to the knowledge of this film's big twist prior to my viewing , it didn't really detract from my overall enjoyment of the picture . Based on the novel " Fallen Angel " by William Hjortsberg , it's a very interesting and compelling story , quite watchable throughout . Director Alan Parker creates some truly creepy imagery , as well as a potent feeling of dread . He slowly but steadily guides us on a journey where we can be sure that whatever Harry uncovers , it's not going to be pleasant . Its twists and turns are a good deal of fun , and the atmosphere of both NYC and New Orleans in 1955 is well realized on screen . In fact , the overall effect of " Angel Heart " is a rather disturbing one , considering one of the twists . There's also a very somber inevitability to the film , and a message about how we can be living a lie and not willing to admit it . Rourke is very good in his star turn , especially as the film progresses . De Niro offers a marvelously subtle , cagey portrayal of evil in human form . Lisa Bonet is quite striking in the key supporting role of Epiphany , with Charlotte Rampling equally as alluring as the black - magic obsessed Margaret . Familiar actors in small parts include Michael Higgins , Kathleen Wilhoite , Pruitt Taylor Vince , and Dann Florek of ' Law and Order : SVU ' fame . " Angel Heart " is recommended viewing for anyone who likes a good mystery .
399832	1391795	62885	9.0	One of Hammer's all-time best .	The beloved horror star Christopher Lee gets a rare chance to be the heroic lead in this well - done terror tale . He plays Duc de Richleau , who with his friend Rex ( Leon Greene ) seeks out their friend Simon ( Patrick Mower ) when Simon fails to attend a reunion . When they find him , the Duc realizes that Simon has become involved with a cult of Satanists . As the story progresses , it's not just Simon who must be rescued , but innocent young Tanith ( Nike Arrighi ) as well . Director Terence Fisher was at the helm of many a Hammer horror picture ; he ranks as one of the most prolific directors ever in the genre and delivered some bona fide classics . " The Devil Rides Out " rates as one of his best efforts . Scripted by author Richard Matheson from the novel by Dennis Wheatley , it's an extremely classy and very well made film . It takes the familiar , eternal battle between good and evil and develops it in interesting ways . Full of atmosphere , portents , and escalating tension , it delivers not one but two climaxes and some surprises as well . The premise is treated with the utmost seriousness , with genuinely believable and unsettling scenes of Devil worship . Lee is wonderful as the gentlemanly , dapper hero who knows what needs to be done , with Charles Gray an excellent opponent as the eerie villain Mocata . Gray's scenes are among the creepiest in the film , as he successfully manages to hypnotize and manipulate those around him . Greene lends some solid support as the loyal Rex , who finds himself falling for Tanith . Arrighi has a delightfully ethereal appeal and beauty in this role . Mower displays a strong likability as the weak Simon . In a small role , Gwen Ffrangcon Davies is remarkable as the Countess . James Bernard gives us another of his overpowering , thoroughly menacing music scores , with stylish and moody cinematography by Arthur Grant . Grant and production designer Bernard Robinson definitely help Fisher capture the ambiance of each and every scene . For good old-fashioned horror , one would be hard pressed to find as effective a picture as this . The ending is especially impressive as it utilizes a concept that's certainly not usually to be expected in this sort of fare . It's a good-looking , spooky , and tense film that wastes not a single moment .
398981	1391795	76759	9.0	The Force Will Be With You . . . Always .	A bona fide pop-culture phenomenon , this memorable movie remains one of the most popular movies ever made . Although it no longer enthralls me the way it used to , it still provides solid entertainment . Mark Hamill plays Luke Skywalker , a restless and ambitious youth who yearns to join Rebel forces that are trying to rise up against the evil " Galactic Empire . " Chief among his allies are his aged mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi ( Sir Alec Guinness ) , cocky and macho spaceship pilot Han Solo ( Harrison Ford ) , Solo's hairy co-pilot Chewbacca ( Peter Mayhew ) , and the droids C-3P0 ( Anthony Daniels ) and R2-D2 ( Kenny Baker ) , as he races to rescue Princess Leia ( Carrie Fisher ) , the kidnapped daughter of a royal family . Featuring special effects that broke new ground back in the 1970's , an unforgettable , catchy score by John Williams , great sets , locations , and characters , I think it may be a hard movie to hate . I would recommend that most people see it at least once . I agree with something said in another user comment . I would be more than happy to erase all my memories of the film and be experiencing it again for the first time . There was something special about the initial trilogy , something that is , I think , unfortunately missing from this current crop of films . I'm only speaking for myself , of course , but I must say that they're just not the same . Part of it may be the fact that these new movies were a long time in coming , and the wonderment and fascination I felt as a child is now replaced by a seen-a-lot ( if not all ) sort of complacency . It's still fun to watch , and if I were asked , I would say that any of the scenes on Tatooine would be my favorites from the film - including the attack of the Sand People , and that memorable trip to the Cantina - with all those weird and wacky alien creatures . ( Trivia note : Rick Baker was one of the makeup artists . ) British veterans Guinness and Peter Cushing ( best known for his legacy of Hammer horror films ) are excellent choices for Kenobi and Grand Moff Tarkin , and the Hamill-Ford-Fisher team works well together . If you're savvy enough about the making of this film , you may know that its casting was happening about the same time as the casting for the movie " Carrie " , and that William Katt - a . k . a . " Tommy Ross " - was up for the role of Luke Skywalker here . I've even read that Christopher Walken ( it's true ) was a contender for the role of Han Solo . If you read the trivia page for this film , you'll find lots of interesting little tidbits of information . I give it nine out of 10 ; this is only because , like I said , it doesn't quite do for me what it used to . But I could never get sick of it ! I heartily recommend it .
399837	1391795	62765	9.0	One of the all-time great cop thrillers .	Steve McQueen plays dedicated police detective Frank Bullitt , who takes the assignment of guarding a government witness . However , the witness gets blown away on the first night , and the circumstances tell Bullitt that something strange is going on . He gets a lot of flak from the grandstanding , ambitious D . A . Chalmers ( McQueen's " Magnificent Seven " co-star Robert Vaughn ) , but does have the support of his superior , Captain Bennet ( Simon Oakland ) and help of his partner Delgetti ( Don Gordon ) . For the most part , this classic cop thriller has a refreshingly unhurried pace . Nothing about this movie is overblown or melodramatic ; director Peter Yates and company adhere to a realism and believability that very well suits the material ( it's based on a novel called " Mute Witness " by Robert L . Pike ) . It pre-dates " Dirty Harry " by a few years , sharing similarities such as the San Francisco location and the maverick " hero " with a steadfast commitment to his job . It's even got a jazzy score by Lalo Schifrin , who went on to score four of the " Dirty Harry " series entries . It gets off to an impressive start with some stylized opening credits and gives us as viewers enough time to digest each scene and appreciate it , rather than racing to get to the next set piece . The undeniable highlight is the climactic , much-heralded car chase , one of the best ever committed to celluloid . The climax set at the airport is equally impressive . The role of the taciturn Bullitt is ideal for McQueen , who receives strong assistance from his supporting cast , also including Jacqueline Bisset as his girlfriend , Robert Duvall as a helpful cabbie , Norman Fell as Captain Baker , Georg Stanford Brown as Dr . Willard , Carl Reindel as Stanton , and Felice Orlandi as the witness . ( Vic Tayback can be seen at the outset , as well . ) " Bullitt " is a movie that continues to hold up well over 40 years later . It's a real gem of its type , with a good script , sharp dialog , excellent editing and location work , and a solid , understated presentation . I would not call it an action picture per se ; as has already been said , it's far more about telling a story and the relentless drive to solve a crime then indulging in gunfire and explosions for the sake of satiation . It's a movie worth discovering or re-visiting .
399567	1391795	82592	9.0	" Hey , we're on an outing , here . "	It may have been inevitable that with the onslaught of " slasher " movies in the early 1980's , that a few good ones might slip through the cracks . This is a great " rare " film from Jeff Lieberman , who insured his cult status with his memorable 1970's films " Squirm " and " Blue Sunshine " . Five young people head into the Oregon mountains ( this movie was actually shot on location ) to do some camping and check out the deed to some land that one of them has acquired . Before long , they will predictably be terrorized by a bulky killer with an incredibly creepy wheezing laugh . " Just Before Dawn " is noticeably more ambitious , " arty " , and intelligent than some slasher films . Lieberman actually fleshes out the characters - well , two of them , anyway - as much as a 90-minute-long film will allow him . The film has genuine moments of suspense and tension , and actually refrains from graphic gore , save for one killing right at the beginning . There is an above-average cast here , including Oscar winner George Kennedy , as a forest ranger who's understandably gone a little flaky from having been alone in the wilderness for too long . Jack Lemmon's son Chris , future Brian De Palma regular Gregg Henry , blonde lead Deborah Benson ( it's too bad she hasn't become a more well-known performer , judging by her work here ) , Ralph Seymour ( " Ghoulies " ) , Mike Kellin ( " Sleepaway Camp " ) , and Jamie Rose ( " Chopper Chicks in Zombietown " ) round out the cast . Some of the shots are interesting , and the early music score by Brad Feidel ( now best known for his " Terminator " theme ) is haunting and atmospheric . This is worth catching for the important plot twist at about the one hour mark , although a moment at about 75 minutes in involving the heroine and a tree and the killer is almost comical ; it may actually remind a viewer of a cartoon ! One of the most clever touches is the final dispatching of the killer , which I'd never seen before in a horror film and probably won't see again . I didn't give it because I can't honestly that I was that frightened . Still , it's an interesting slasher that is worthy of re-discovery . " That deed don't mean nothing , son . Those mountains can't read . "
399577	1391795	387564	9.0	A very effective thriller ; graphic and gripping .	Based on their nine minute short subject from 2003 , then-newcomers Leigh Whannell and James Wan concocted this dark and oppressive movie about a successful surgeon ( Cary Elwes ) and a younger man ( Whannell ) chained up inside an extremely filthy washroom . It turns out that they are the prisoners of a madman who desires that they participate in a game of survival . Now successful enough to have spawned an ongoing franchise , the fourth part of the series comes out later this year . It's a very affecting experience - just as visceral as one could expect , but not a true no-brainer either . The villain , Jigsaws ' , mission is to make his victims learn to appreciate life , so there's a little bit of moralizing here . It also worked for me by presenting me with the intriguing type of scenario where I'm compelled to consider what I would do in the exact same situation . Although some of the emoting here isn't too convincing , the acting is mostly good ; Elwes and Whannell do a good job of drawing me into their predicament , and the supporting cast is quite efficient : Danny Glover , Ken Leung , and Dina Meyer as investigating detectives , Monica Potter as the surgeons ' wife , Shawnee Smith as a former victim , and , best of all , character veteran Tobin Bell , who after a number of years in the business , finally became a star - at least in the horror genre - thanks to his convincing performance as the icy and sadistic Jigsaw . It does go without saying that this isn't for everybody ; the squeamish and faint of heart should already know that this wouldn't be their idea of a good time . However , while there is some very bloody mayhem to behold here , I would say that there's more to this than just torture for tortures ' sake . The movie still works even in the non-bloody scenes ; it was riveting for me from beginning to end . Regardless of how much or how little sympathy one has for the victims , I think it would be hard to not feel some degree of concern for their ordeal . The story was filled with an enjoyable series of twists and turns , also helping to prevent it from ever being dull . It had a very good revelation in the end ; I did not see it coming , and it ended the picture on an effectively bleak note . It's one of the more potent pictures that I've seen lately .
398712	1391795	90605	9.0	One of the best sequels EVER !	After 57 years of drifting through space , Ellen Ripley ( Sigourney Weaver ) is picked up and brought back to civilization . She learns that the planet she and her ill-fated comrades visited in the first movie has now been colonized . When contact is lost with the colonists , Ripley is not the least bit surprised . " The Company " sends a squad of marines to the planet on the chance that xenomorphs ( i . e . aliens ) are to blame , and Ripley agrees to go along as an advisor . A very long movie , especially in the 155-minute director's cut ( including footage that used to be included just for TV showings ) but so entertaining that it's not even a quibble . It's gripping , compelling , scary , action-packed , and suspenseful . It doesn't have the stark , bleak simplicity and sense of innovation that the first movie did - but boy is it cool . It does take a while to get going as the events of the movie are set up , but once it kicks into high gear . . . Excellent cast ; Weaver is wonderful and ably supported by a cast including two actors who worked for director James Cameron in " The Terminator " : Michael Biehn ( Cpl . Hicks ) and Lance Henriksen ( the android Bishop ) . The quiet stoicism of several characters , including spunky young survivor ' Newt ' ( Carrie Henn ) is a little too impressive to be believed ; for my money , the film's funniest / best performance is by Bill Paxton ( Lt . Hudson ) , who switches from obnoxious , swaggering overconfidence to flamboyant cowardice after his first run-in with the aliens . And how about selfish Company weasel Paul Reiser - in a good dramatic performance as Carter J . Burke - his lies ( " I work for the Company , but basically I'm an okay guy . " " That's the plan . You have our word on it . " ) are some of the biggest whoppers I've ever heard in this kind of film . But one of the best things about it is the creature effects , especially the design of the fearsome Queen Alien - which is truly a sight to behold when I first see it . The movie doesn't even lose anything after repeated viewings .
399786	1391795	71216	9.0	A supremely engaging 1970's exploitation classic .	Angie Dickinson is a delightful combination of gutsy determination and femininity in this raucous , sleazy good time from producer Roger Corman . She plays Wilma McClatchie , a mother of two teenage daughters during the Depression who makes up her mind that the three of them will survive despite the odds , and no matter what they have to do . They take to the road in a series of daring robberies , hooking up with hot-tempered bank robber Fred Diller ( a gloriously blustery Tom Skerritt ) and the more refined William J . Baxter ( William Shatner , as always a real hoot ) . Pursuing them the entire time are two constantly bumbling federal agents played for maximum silliness by Dick Miller and Tom Signorelli . This is one of those movies that has it both ways - it's exploitation and empowerment at the same time - and does it well . It's a bouncy , breezy , fast paced , action-packed film with not one dull moment . The entertaining script , credited to both William Norton and Frances Doel , gives Dickinson some great lines , and successfully balances hearty laughs with genuinely poignant moments . Director Steve Carver , who'd go on to do other fine action films as " Eye for an Eye " and " Lone Wolf McQuade " with Chuck Norris , handles it all in high style . Of course , no assessment of this film would be complete without words of appreciation for Dickinson's nude scenes ; she's simply exquisite . Susan Sennett ( " The Candy Snatchers " ) and Robbie Lee ( " Switchblade Sisters " ) add a lot of appeal as the wildly contrasting daughters ; Billy Jean ( Sennett ) is a free spirit and truly her mother's daughter , and Polly ( Lee ) is endearingly sweet , naive , and childish . The supporting cast plays it all with an equally impressive amount of gusto : Noble Willingham as the ill-fated " Uncle " Barney , Royal Dano as a flummoxed preacher , sexy Joan Prather as spoiled rich brat Jane Kingston , Sally Kirkland as Barney's woman , and Michael Talbott as the sheriff's son . Be sure to watch for the uncredited bit appearance by Paul Bartel , who was second unit director on this film . David Grisman's country-flavored music score is fantastic , and Carver and crew get pretty good production values out of their small budget . The use of old scene transitions such as " wipes " and " iris shots " just add to the sense of fun . The final shot of the film - at the conclusion of the end credits - is one of the brightest and funniest that I've ever seen . " Big Bad Mama " is one hell of a fine B-movie , and eventually got itself a sequel 13 years later . Two trivia notes : 1 . Bill Paxton was set dresser on this film , and 2 . Shatner , Skerritt , and Prather were all in the film " The Devil's Rain " a year later .
399359	1391795	119592	9.0	I think it's fantastic .	Dustin Hoffman plays a disgraced former newsman named Max Brackett , who inadvertently stumbles into the story that could rejuvenate his career : security guard Sam Baily ( John Travolta ) , who's miserable over being laid off , has tried to talk to his former boss ( Blythe Danner ) at gunpoint , and ended up taking hostages . Brackett proceeds to manipulate the course of events - and Baily himself - in order to ensure a major news spectacle . This is tops in my book ; I just thought it was so compelling , and even though I've seen it once before , I still got a charge out of it . It kept me interested , and it featured great performances by all the major actors - especially Hoffman , who really owns the movie . It certainly paints an ugly picture of the media - and although I'm sure there are a number of media types who really do glorify and magnify stories at the expense of facts , I'm not ignorant enough to believe they are all like that . This is a genuinely entertaining movie and I would recommend it to others .
399911	1391795	59170	10.0	My first Russ Meyer flick .	" Russ Meyer's ode to the violence in women " is a great camp and trash flick that posits the idea that sexual liberation and female empowerment does not always change women for the better . Our three antagonists - Varla ( Tura Satana ) , Rosie ( Haji ) , and Billie ( Lori Williams ) are go-go girls , hedonistic free spirits out for kicks . When Varla murders a young man , the three of them abduct his distraught girlfriend ( Sue Bernard ) . They then come to a remote homestead presided over by a lecherous father figure ( Stuart Lancaster ) with an animosity towards women . Varla's learned that he's got money stashed away somewhere , and is determined to get her hands on it . Sometimes comedic , sometimes melodramatic , the movie features three well-endowed main characters , especially Satana , who's practically busting out the entire time . These fine ladies sink their teeth into these juicy parts with reckless abandon . Satana dominates the entire film like a true force of nature . The film pounds along to an overbearing music score ( not to mention a groovy theme song ) ; it's flashy , trashy and at the least is certainly never boring . Highlights include the old man's brawny , mentally challenged son ( Dennis Busch ) , who's credited as " The Vegetable " , believe it or not , pinned against a wall by a car and successfully managing to keep it from crushing him ! It's as much a good story of male weakness as it is female aggression ; the old man is a great case in point as is his supposedly heroic son Kirk ( Paul Trinka ) ; even he is not immune to the wiles of the domineering Varla . It all takes place in some impressively desolate landscapes , with a strong sense of flair to the proceedings . It gets pretty brutal , too . It's full of some cool and memorable quotes . In addition to the leads , Bernard is especially enticing as the young , imperiled cutie who looks great in a bikini , and Lancaster is a hoot as the randy old man . " Faster , Pussycat ! Kill ! Kill ! " is a fun flick that serves up prime titillation and exploitation for 84 minutes of straight-up fun .
399254	1391795	83866	10.0	Truly memorable and moving science-fiction .	Friendly and timid alien botanist is stranded on planet Earth and is befriended by ten-year-old boy ( Henry Thomas ) who becomes so attached to the visitor that he begins to feel everything that the creature is feeling . While the alien is being sought out by stereotypically ignorant government agents , Elliott ( Thomas ) helps the little guy out by setting up an improvised communication device in the forest that will send a distress signal to his home planet . There's a reason why this movie is so enduringly popular and successful : you would have to be a very hard , unemotional person not to feel SOMETHING watching this movie . It tugs at the heartstrings effectively without doing so in an overly saccharine manner . Endearing and sympathetic performances by everybody , including E . T . " himself " . John Williams offers up yet another of his immediately unforgettable scores , and the creature effects team bring E . T . to convincing " life " . ( Incredibly enough , I've heard for the longest time that actress Debra Winger contributed to E . T . ' s vocal performance . ) Followed by an unnecessary re-release twenty years later with improved effects , additional scenes , and altered footage . I for one was impressed with the film as it was and didn't think it needed any re-tooling . Oh well , I guess you're always going to have instances where directors feel the need to " improve " their films , or turn it more into the kind of film they initially wanted to make . Universal released this around the same time that they released John Carpenter's " The Thing " and it's apparent from " E . T . " ' s success and " The Thing " ' s failure that audiences at the time preferred to see a family film with a friendly alien than an adult film with a hostile alien . This is definitely one blockbuster of a movie that DESERVED to be a blockbuster .
398784	1391795	72251	10.0	A winner of a movie , in every way .	Excellent thriller from 1974 about an incredibly prepared quartet of criminals , led by ' Mr . Blue ' ( Robert Shaw ) , who hijack a subway train and hold its conductor and 17 passengers hostage for $1 million in ransom money - to be delivered in just one hour . A phenomenal cast delivers the goods in a witty , clever , and thoroughly pumped up movie that never lets up . The pace is consistently intense , and the action is often loud and furious . Walter Matthau , as the heroic Lt . Garber , and Shaw as Blue , make for a classy and compulsively watchable pair of adversaries . Shaw's Mr . Blue is the kind of movie villain who always seems to have the upper hand , having thought everything out so well beforehand , and he's also the kind of guy who never is seen to lose his cool . Mr . Green's cohorts are played by the superb veterans Martin Balsam ( the ill-fated private detective from the original " Psycho " ) and Hector Elizondo . Earl Hindman , who would 17 years later catch my attention as the quirky yet wise neighbor Wilson on ' Home Improvement ' , is the fourth and youngest member of the team . An absolutely incredible lineup of familiar faces fills out the other roles : James Broderick ( Matthew's father ) as the motorman Doyle , Dick O'Neill as the hostile Frank Correll , as well as Jerry Stiller , Doris Roberts , Julius Harris , Tony Roberts , Lee Wallace , and Kenneth McMillan . In the tradition of other 1970's classics like " Serpico " and " Taxi Driver " , the movie captures the ambiance of 1970's era NYC very well . You just can't beat authentic location filming for this kind of story . Highlighted by an especially amusing ending , which ultimately pays off a running gag , present throughout , regarding one of the crooks . Exciting and well-made ; one of the high points of veteran director Joseph Sargent's career . Followed by a made-for-TV remake 24 years later .
399544	1391795	83739	10.0	A wonderfully visceral and gripping cult flick .	" Class of 1984 " is a highly memorable melodrama depicting a high school of the " future " overridden by violence and crime . Sadly , this premise , while far-out at the time , turned out to be all too prophetic . Perry King plays Andy Norris , the new music teacher at this high school . He's replacing a man named Goldstein who supposedly had an " accident " . Almost immediately , Andy is butting heads with the kingpin of this school , a snot-nosed and deranged under-age creep named Peter Stegman ( Timothy Van Patten ) . Andy refuses to be bullied by the young psychopath , and their war of wills reaches an inevitable breaking point when Stegman and his gang target Andy's pregnant wife ( Merrie Lynn Ross ) . Van Patten creates a very vivid villain who I had a lot of fun hating , but the real star of this movie is , for me , veteran Roddy McDowall . The " Planet of the Apes " series star is biology teacher Terry Corrigan , an embittered alcoholic despondent over the fact that he can't get his students to want to learn anything , and who is clearly just one step from a nervous breakdown . His highlight scene is the said breakdown , where he forces his students to answer biology questions at gunpoint . Canadian legend Al Waxman pops in from time to time as the detective who is basically powerless to appropriately punish these young miscreants . And Michael J . Fox ( billed here without the middle initial ) makes an early screen appearance as a dorky little wise-guy . Yes , this film is undeniably lurid and perverse trash . But it WORKS . The struggle between Andy and Stegman is too compelling to ignore , and the ultra-violent final battle had me on the edge of my seat , cheering on Andy as he handles things the Charles Bronson way . Co-star Ross has little to do . Essentially , she seems to function more as a plot device than as a character - as in the plot device that will conclusively drive Andy over the edge . The film is co-written with future film director Tom Holland , and features a song contribution by Alice Cooper ( " I Am The Future " ) . " Class of 1984 " is a great dose of 1980's trash with a nice side dish of social comment ; it's one of the finest films of its kind that I've ever seen . Note that if you check out the external reviews link , even Roger Ebert had to admit that he enjoyed it ! I certainly give it a hearty endorsement myself .
398904	1391795	87332	10.0	A genuinely good time .	Entertaining mix of laughs and scares in this memorable hit from the 1980's that became an addition to pop culture in the process . Three scientists / researchers ( Bill Murray , Dan Aykroyd , Harold Ramis ) are kicked out of a university and decide to start their own business : catching and incarcerating a variety of ghosts and demons that are haunting NYC . It doesn't get better than this , folks . It has all the right ingredients : good laughs ( many of them deadpan one-liners spoken by Murray ) , good cast , good special effects , and a good pace . Maybe not totally politically correct in its inclusion of a " token black Ghostbuster " ( Ernie Hudson ) , although the sequel is actually more politically incorrect - - watch the scene ( in the sequel ) with Winston ( Hudson ) and the phantom subway train and you'll see what I mean . Also launched veteran actor William Atherton on a long , endless streak of playing pompous , vain , white-collar jerks ; his character , EPA rep Walter Peck , has got to be the first instance of an environmentalist being portrayed as a villain that I've seen . One of the 1980's best comedies ; I give it .
399875	1391795	96071	10.0	Good work !	In this intense thriller inspired by a non-fiction book by Wade Davis , Bill Pullman plays Dr . Dennis Alan , who travels to Haiti in search of a mysterious white powder that is supposed to have powers of resurrection . While there , he hooks up with attractive local doctor Marielle Duchamp ( Cathy Tyson ) and locks horns with nasty , psychotic villain Dargent Peytraud ( Zakes Mokae ) . For me , " The Serpent and the Rainbow " is one of those rare scary movies that thoroughly engrossed me . It's a heart-pounding , solidly acted ( particularly by Mokae ) , elaborate movie with lots of local flavor since the film-makers had the good sense to film it on location in Haiti . The atmosphere is so heavy that it's palpable . I would consider it to be one of the better Wes Craven pictures which I have seen . It's probably not one of his better known films - I think that most of them get kind of over-shadowed by the original " Nightmare on Elm Street " and the " Scream " trilogy . But I would suggest that interested viewers seek it out . It takes Dr . Alan and the viewer on an interesting if morbid journey .
399900	1391795	84516	10.0	Excellent PG-rated horror thriller .	Young family in cozy suburban neighborhood is suddenly besieged by a hostile , dastardly spirit that drags the adorable youngest child into the netherworld . They call upon a para-psychological team , then a genuinely gifted clairvoyant , to help them get back the little girl . Admittedly , this ghost story may be technically directed by Tobe Hooper , but is clearly filtered through the sensibilities of writer / producer Steven Spielberg , making this more family friendly than it might have been otherwise . " Poltergeist " is a slick , mainstream movie with a heavy accent on flashy special effects , but it also presents us with a reasonably likable and sympathetic family . It's a long film but doesn't feel as long as it is , with segments that are consistent in holding my attention . Young Heather O'Rourke was a real find as the angelic little girl , and it's saddening to think that both she and co-star Dominique Dunne ( who plays the eldest child ) were lost at such young ages . The cast is very good , with standout work by JoBeth Williams as the wife and mother , Beatrice Straight as the head of the research team , and , of course , the one-of-a-kind Zelda Rubinstein as the clairvoyant . I'll also watch almost anything with James Karen in it - he's simply a great character actor . " Poltergeist " is decent entertainment that save for one ghoulish nightmare sequence should be acceptable fare for older children . I really liked it ; good work by all concerned .
399461	1391795	44954	10.0	A very enjoyable film noir gem .	Gravel-voiced tough guy Charles McGraw plays Det . Sgt . Walter Brown , assigned to escort a gangsters ' widow , Mrs . Neall ( the striking Marie Windsor ) on a train ride to the trial in which she will testify against a crime ring . They don't even get to the train before hit men start stalking them . The train ride itself proves to be very eventful as Brown has to keep dodging the killers . The picture gets off to a truly great start indicative of the noir style , with very stylish and sinister use of shadow . It's therefore too bad that the rest of the picture is rather brightly lit , but the picture still succeeds admirably due to snappy dialog , bright repartee , and a full-steam-ahead pace . The movie clocks in at a tight and breezy running time of 72 minutes ; there's no filler and the tension is undeniable . The train makes for a nicely claustrophobic setting . McGraw makes for a great " hard boiled " and edgy hero , and it's hard to take ones ' eyes off the gorgeous Windsor . Fine support is provided by David Clarke , Gordon Gebert , Jacqueline White , Queenie Leonard , Peter Virgo , Don Beddoe , Paul Maxey , and Peter Brocco . Attention-getting and riveting from the start , this little movie is quite simply a great deal of fun .
399378	1391795	71650	10.0	My first dose of Nazisploitation .	Ilsa ( Dyanne Thorne , in a deliciously wicked performance ) is the Kommandant at a concentration camp during WWII . She holds dominion over both male and female prisoners alike . Mostly , what she does is put them through torture - especially the females ; she aims to prove that females have a higher threshold for pain and will go to extreme lengths to prove her theory . Recommended to me as one of the defining movies of its genre , " Ilsa , She Wolf of the SS " is only for those who like their entertainment as vile and tasteless as ( in ) humanly possible . This movie wallows in sleaze , depravity and kinkiness for a hearty and hellish 96 minutes . It offers a non-stop and loving display of the female anatomy and liberal doses of sex are likewise included . The methods of torture are insidious and leave quite the impression . ( Joe Blasco contributes the very effective gore . ) A deeply committed cast plays this sadistic and nasty trash for all it's worth . The buxom Ms . Thorne makes for a memorable villainess , with able support from Gregory Knoph as Wolfe , the male prisoner who turns Ilsa on , Tony Mumolo as Mario , George " Buck " Flower ( billed as C . D . Lafleuer ) as Binz , and Richard Kennedy ( billed as Wolfgang Roehm ) as the visiting general whom , in an inspired bit of filth , is urinated on by Ilsa . With the generous servings of sex , violence , and general all-around brutality that it offers , this rates as one hell of an exploitation flick . I now pass on the recommendation for it to anyone with a healthy appetite for sleaze . It remains true to itself throughout and is a completely unpretentious good time , leading up to a reasonably rousing climax and a downbeat conclusion .
398620	1391795	58150	10.0	Classy , exciting , and definitive entry in the legendary Bond series .	Superagent James Bond ( Sean Connery , as charming as always ) is interrupted during a vacation for the task of keeping an eye on Auric Goldfinger ( German actor Gert Frobe , dubbed by Englishman Michael Collins ) . In time , Bond discovers Goldfinger's master plan to contaminate the gold supply in Fort Knox in order to maximize the value of his own gold supply . Assisting Goldfinger is supremely sexy pilot Honor Blackman , blessed with one of the singularly most memorable monikers for a Bond girl ever in " Pussy " Galore . " Goldfinger " is one of those films where everything comes together very well . It's fast paced and displays the kind of wit and humor that lets us know that none of this will ever be taken too seriously . It's grand escapist fare moving from one dazzling set piece to another . There's the sight of ill-fated early victim Jill ( Shirley Eaton ) completely covered in gold paint , the sight of Bond ( actually displaying a genuine and obvious nervousness for once ) in danger of being cut in half by a laser , the climactic raid on Fort Knox , and so much more . The film is certainly an important entry in the franchise for firmly establishing such elements as well staged action , impressive foreign locales , wonderfully elaborate villainous designs , awesome gadgets ( the Aston Martin makes its first appearance here ) , and colorful bad guys . Goldfinger and mostly mute sidekick / henchman Oddjob ( Harold Sakata ) became so iconic as to get spoofed many times since . Desmond Llewelyn as gadget designer Q makes his first substantial appearance in a Bond film and is delightful as always . In addition to series regulars Bernard Lee as M and Lois Maxwell as Moneypenny , the supporting cast includes Tania Mallett as Jill's revenge-seeking sister Tilly , Martin Benson as the mobster Solo , Cec Linder as Bond's CIA contact / friend Felix Leiter , Michael Mellinger as henchman Kisch , and Burt Kwouk ( Cato in the " Pink Panther " series ) as Mr . Ling . It gets off to a grand start with what is , for my money , one of the catchiest , most irresistible Bond theme songs ever , belted out with great gusto by Ms . Shirley Bassey . Production designer Ken Adam's set for the interior of Fort Knox is amazing . " Goldfinger " is as fun and engaging as any spy adventure could be . It's one of the all-time great films of its genre .
399426	1391795	49366	10.0	Superbly eerie and intelligent sci-fi / horror .	Based on Jack Finney's serialized novel , this much lauded classic contains themes that can still carry into today . Even if the subtext read into it is centered on the political / social turmoil of the times , the ideas of xenophobia , paranoia , and a low-key evil that gets under your skin as it tries to eliminate your free will can always be powerful . The loss of our individuality , in essence our souls , is maybe one of the scariest things that we can imagine , as each of us becomes just one part of a mass collective . Dr . Miles Bennell ( Kevin McCarthy ) returns to his small California town of Santa Mira and finds out that various citizens are complaining that their loved ones are no longer themselves . But this is just the beginning . Miles and his sweetheart Becky ( Dana Wynter ) become witness to carbon copies of their own bodies materializing ( and conveniently disappearing ) . Eventually , Miles finds out that " seed pods " are hatching these copies of the locals while they sleep . More and more of the locals succumb until Miles and Becky are running for their lives , hoping to make it out of town and warn the rest of the world . There are scenes in this movie that can indelibly etch themselves in viewers ' minds . Who that has ever seen Kevin McCarthy frantically standing among busy traffic and screaming , " They're here already ! YOU'RE NEXT ! " will ever forget this ? The scene in the town square is also positively chilling as it illustrates a multitude of citizens quietly coming together . The seed pods are also a memorable plot point . This was an interesting contrast to alien invasion stories of the time ; there's no spaceships coming down to Earth in this one . This time , the menace is already taking place . The effects are nicely done without us having to see all the details . Don Siegel offers very efficient , taut , no-nonsense direction , working from a script by Daniel Mainwaring . Carmen Dragon's score is very ominous and the use of the locations is impeccable . The actors all do a tremendous job of selling the material . McCarthy and Wynter are great leads , with fine support by Larry Gates , King Donovan , and Carolyn Jones and good contributions in small parts by Virginia Christine , Jean Willes , Ralph Dumke , and Dabbs Greer . Be sure to look out for future director Sam Peckinpah ( dialog director on this picture ) , as Charlie the gas man . The picture loses just a little something in its longer cut ; Allied Artists didn't like the overall bleakness of the picture , and insisted on adding a prologue and epilogue featuring Whit Bissell and Richard Deacon as doctors trying to assess Bennell . This is an attempt to inject some sort of hope for the outcome , and while the picture still works very well , this addition takes away some of the chilling impact . This cut would get nine out of 10 from me . But no matter what , this movie is a true classic that genre fans ought to catch at least once . Remade in 1978 , in 1993 ( as " Body Snatchers " ) , and 2007 ( as " The Invasion " ) .
399909	1391795	106308	10.0	" Hail to the king , baby ! "	Ash ( Bruce Campbell ) , the main character from the two " Evil Dead " movies , has ended up in medieval times where he ends up on a quest to find the Book of the Dead ( a . k . a . ' Necronomicon ' ) . He's so dense he only remembers two of the three words that he has to say before grabbing the book , and he ultimately resurrects a legion of skeletal warriors , led by an ' evil ' version of himself . " Army of Darkness " is not as rooted in the horror genre as its predecessors - although it has its horrific elements - but it seems to be first and foremost a comedy - with lots of one-liners and slapstick . It's kind of a delirious combination of horror , comedy , fantasy , action , and adventure . Campbell is hilarious as Ash , firing off his one-liners as obnoxiously as possible and dominating the screen . Embeth Davidtz makes an appealing movie debut as ' Sheila ' , and several of co-writer / director Sam Raimi's colleagues ( including his brothers Theodore and Ivan ) have roles . " Army of Darkness " is for the most part very well paced and does not take many breathers . It relies on special effects a lot , but the effects are often entertaining . It is a slick major studio effort from Raimi that concludes this trilogy on a high note . Incidentally , just how many times has this been released and re-released on DVD ? ! ?
