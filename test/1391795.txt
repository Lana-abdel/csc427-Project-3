398698	1391795	118708	1.0	Beverly Hills Nincompoop Is More Like It .	Haru ( Chris Farley ) is a white guy who washed up on the shores of Japan as a baby and is trained to be a ninja by the locals . As could be expected , he grows up to be an incompetent , clumsy bumbler . That doesn't stop him , however , from accepting an offer from California girl Allison ( Nicollette Sheridan ) to spy on her slimy English boyfriend ( Nathaniel Parker ) . I'm sorry , folks , but this is just plain AWFUL . I didn't like ANYTHING about this movie . It's full of standard Chris Farley comedy - tripping , crashing , breaking , flailing - all to no effect . Much of the cast doesn't look happy to be in the movie - and Chris Rock , funny guy that he is , is saddled with a STUPID role . Then again , I suppose if you do have an appreciation for what Farley does , you may be satisfied . Remember , this is just my opinion . ! ( My lowest rating ever since I started doing this ! )
399608	1391795	338325	3.0	The cameos are amusing , but there's not much to recommend here .	Supposed " nice " guy Bo Laramie ( Cole Hauser , in his first star turn ) is the hot new action star of the moment ; as his first big film vehicle is opening , he is hounded by repellent , monstrous celebrity photographers led by Tom Sizemore ( in an admittedly great " bad guy " performance ) who endanger the lives of his family . So what does Bo do ? He goes after them with a vengeance . I didn't think that it was such a " fun " movie . I hated the alleged " hero " as much as the villains . I truly didn't think there was anybody to root for . It was unpleasant , as revenge thrillers often tend to be , and the way that these self-righteous filmmakers hammered us over the head with their all-too-obvious agenda mitigated against whatever enjoyment there might have been . This film has some good actors in it , but there are no really good roles . Everything is in black and white here , with no middle ground . And the detective played by Dennis Farina ( himself a real-life cop once , as if I need to tell anybody ) comes off as a dubious character himself in the end result . This film was heavy-handed , annoying , and stupid . I know I will inevitably get many negative responses to this review , but this is just how I felt . I disliked this film , and probably would have hated it outright were it not for my automated response to visceral type thrills .
399385	1391795	309530	3.0	It was a hard film for me to easily enjoy . . .	Parody of and tribute to Rock Hudson / Doris Day romantic / sex comedies from the 1960's ; this movie tells the story of a celebrated feminist author ( Renee Zellweger ) and the womanizing , superstar columnist ( Ewan McGregor ) who is determined to prove that she is a phony . Well , it's a triumph of 1960's-style production and costume design , if nothing else . One may have to be familiar with the kind of movies that this movie is sending up in order to appreciate it . It didn't really charm me , however - I found it to be pretty annoying and silly throughout and none of the upbeat , likable performances of the primary performers could make enough of a difference . It had me thinking " Oh my God " and rolling my eyes more than once - and that is never a good thing . It's very light and " airy " and is pretty forgettable once it is over . Zellweger has a lengthy monologue about 75 minutes into the movie that pretty much sums up the whole picture ! I guess it could be charitably described as a " personal taste " kind of movie - you will either be charmed by it or as annoyed as I was . At least it had small roles for ' Saturday Night Live ' players Rachel Dratch and Chris Parnell .
399658	1391795	106449	3.0	Even worse than " Prince of Darkness " , this is the worst thing Carpenter's ever done .	Fatally dull horror anthology with " Tales From the Crypt " aspirations in which film-maker John Carpenter , playing a Crypt Keeper-type coroner host , tells three stories . 1 . " The Gas Station " : Alex Datcher plays a young woman who has an eventful , spooky first night at her new job as a graveyard shift gas station attendant . Has some good Carpenter touches , but mostly uninspired story has only the prospect of Robert Carradine playing a psycho to recommend it . Frequent Carpenter actor Buck Flower plays a bum for the umpteenth time in his career . 2 . " Hair " : Stacy Keach plays a guy whose hair loss is driving him crazy . He goes to a special clinic , run by David Warner ( there's your first clue that they're up to no good ) . EXTREMELY dull , and dragged further down by Keach's over-acting , but has a fairly decent pay-off . 3 . " Eye " ( which is actually directed by Tobe Hooper ) : Mark Hamill plays a star baseball player who loses his right eye in a car accident , and in a " Hands of Orlac " type plot twist , receives a new eye from a donor whose identity is not revealed to him at first . Hamill is actually pretty good . In short , it almost seems as if Carpenter were asleep at the wheel when he made this ( he may also send the viewer to sleep ) . He may make little bits and pieces of the film entertaining , but on the whole the film is a failure . I'm so disappointed . Carpenter himself is reasonably amusing , and has cameos for two of his contemporaries : Hooper appears at the end , and - what have we here ? - there's Wes Craven appearing in " The Gas Station " ! Even Roger Corman pops up . Otherwise , don't waste your time with this piece of waste .
398695	1391795	106453	3.0	Pretty Bad , Folks .	Rebecca Carlson ( Madonna ) is picked up by the cops and prosecuted for murdering her wealthy lover in order to get a portion of his money . The gimmick in this case is that she used her own body to kill him - their sex was so kinky that it put too great a strain on his already weak heart . Frank Dulaney ( Willem Dafoe ) is the stupid patsy of a lawyer who takes her case . Dull , sleazy , and stupid in equal measure , this film adds up to very little . Most of the cast is fine ; however , Madonna continues to supply evidence that if she wants to continue acting she should stick to supporting roles ( i . e . A League Of Their Own ) . She is just plain poor in this one . Not worth more than a rental on a slow night . Those hoping to be aroused may not even find it worth the effort ; it's not that sexy . .
399180	1391795	99697	3.0	" Best Be Punchin ' Out Your Timecard . . . "	Based on a short story by Stephen King . Routine , unmemorable horror entry in which the workers at a cotton mill in rural Maine are selected to clean out the mill's lower levels . The main problem is that the mill has an enormous rat problem . . . and an even uglier menace living deep underneath the earth . For starters , the short story of King's that this is based on is NOT one of King's better efforts . It's a brief , gory , pointless tale that I think was only written for shock effect . The movie looks tremendously ugly ; it's the filthiest , most unkempt movie I've seen since " C . H . U . D . " . It also turns out to be gory , mean-spirited , and laughable . The cast is game but they can't save this picture . As always , Brad Dourif , cast as a mangy , creepy exterminator , is entertaining to watch , and his scenes are the best in the movie . Veteran actor Stephen Macht ( father of current young actor Gabriel Macht ) does a decent job as the movie's slimy villain ( he also speaks in a hilarious attempt at a Maine drawl ) . Don't you wish that you could tell movie executives in Hollywood that just because Stephen King's name is bankable that doesn't mean that all of his stories will translate into good feature films ? These film-makers may have wanted to make a horror movie but I guess they didn't care about making it quality horror . For fans of " Wishmaster " parts one and two , and their star , Andrew Divoff , that actor turns up here in one of his earliest roles .
399387	1391795	95626	4.0	Another film from the Charles Bronson-J . Lee Thompson-Cannon Group assembly line .	Charles Bronson plays Denver newspaper reporter Garret Smith , who covers the story of the mind-boggling , evil murder of a whole Mormon family in the Colorado mountains . As the events unfold , Garret learns that the story involves two feuding brothers ( Jeff Corey , John Ireland ) AND a powerful water company . Watchable throughout , but it ultimately ends up below average because it's so mechanically handled ; it's a run-of-the-mill thriller that does not stimulate any emotional involvement , despite the horrific nature of the opening scene . Bronson is a little better than usual , and backed by a few good supporting actors ( Corey , Ireland , Trish Van Devere , Laurence Luckinbill , Daniel Benzali ) . There is one scene that the film kind of has going for it : we've all seen scenes in thrillers where vehicles try to force each other off the road ; this time , TWO big rigs sandwich the van Bronson and Van Devere are driving in between them . The film never goes into a deep exploration of the Mormon culture , just sort of superficially examining it at best . Interestingly , despite all the deaths by gunshot , not as much blood is shown as camera as I would expect . The film gets a better music score than it deserves . Gene Davis , who played the psycho-killer in the Bronson vehicle " 10 To Midnight " plays the ill-fated ' Junior Assassin ' here . Oh , a couple more things : 1 . The fight scenes are incompetently and boringly done . 2 . It's stupid what a wimp the ' Senior Assassin ' turns out to be . 3 . And finally , the films leads up to an unfortunately anticlimactic conclusion . Too bad .
399905	1391795	156413	4.0	All my life I've lived in Winnipeg ; never been inside this theater . . .	A stereotypically disparate group of high school students - all fitting into standardized roles ( the nerd , the jock , the bh , the best friend , etc . ) take their drama class to an old run-down theater ( the mother of one of the girls was an opera star who was murdered in one of that same theater's dressing rooms ) ; lurking in the darkness is a psycho dressed like Pagliacci's clown who disposes of them in short order . I would have liked to have more affection for this ultra-routine bore of a slasher movie , being that it was shot in my hometown - particularly the historic Walker Theater ( now known as the Burton Cummings Center for the Performing Arts ) . This theater makes for a fairly good setting but the script - and some of the performances - are annoyingly dumb . Young star Sarah Lassez - as the tormented heroine - does try hard . Some of you may rightly wonder what Christopher Plummer - in a special guest appearance - is doing in this movie . Talk about slumming . The presence of Margot Kidder - who speaks here with a noticeable lisp - is more understandable and I'm sure she was grateful for the work . All in all , it's too bad that it doesn't add up to much .
399086	1391795	99165	4.0	I can't say I like it but I don't exactly despise it either .	Regarded by many critics as one of the biggest stinkers of all time ( certainly the biggest stinker of director Brian De Palma's career ) . Sherman McCoy ( Tom Hanks ) is a smug rich boy whose life goes to pieces when he and his lover Maria Ruskin ( Melanie Griffith ) are involved in a hit-and-run . His story is chronicled by another smug guy , reporter Peter Fallow ( Bruce Willis ) . Well , as I said in my summary . . . What is this movie supposed to be ? It seems to combine comedy , drama , and satire , but it sure doesn't add up to much . It's undermined by unimaginably loathsome , one-dimensional characters who you'd never want to have the displeasure of meeting in real life . I'm no big fan of the novel ( I started reading it once , but couldn't finish it because it wasn't to my liking ) but it's obvious to me that those who did / do enjoy the novel consider this film to be a complete travesty . I've never seen so many talented actors strive to hard to give a below-average movie some semblance of quality and fail . What a waste . The problems start with casting nice guy Tom Hanks in a role that is clearly supposed to be UNsympathetic . And the role of Peter Fallow in the novel was that of a Brit . Bruce Willis is badly , BADLY miscast in the role . What was the thinking there . Alas , not even Morgan Freeman can escape the film with his dignity intact , being obliged to deliver a lame , heavy-handed lecture on ' decency ' after the climax . This movie ends up turning into an absurd farce . I liked the assemblage of talent ; for that I will give it , but I'm sure some people will say a MUCH better movie could have been made from the source material .
399384	1391795	91575	4.0	LeBrun's Law says don't watch . . .	Run-of-the-mill , less than energetic cop vs . psycho movie in which Jack Murphy ( Charles Bronson ) is a grumpy , alcoholic police detective who is framed for the murder of a few people , including his stripper ex-wife . The culprit is Joan Freeman ( Carrie Snodgress ) , a disturbed creep who is motivated by that old standby : revenge . Along the way , Murphy acquires a spunky , unwilling companion in small-time criminal Arabella McGee ( Kathleen Wilhoite ) , who he drags along when he pulls off a prison break . Nothing to set this apart from the dozens and dozens of other cop movies sitting on video store shelves - except Arabella's deliriously ( and yet enjoyably ) profane mouth . Bronson , as usual , doesn't do any more acting than he has to , leaving it up to the supporting cast to pick up the slack ( not that they all do a great job ) . Snodgress , at least , isn't bad as the villainess . It is sometimes funny in an unintentional way because it is pretty stupid . . . but I'll take my laughs any way that I can get them . Unfortunately , the lack of genuinely likable characters is a debit . Basically , it's just another addition to the 1980's Charles Bronson repertoire . Co-star Wilhoite also sings the title song over the closing credits .
398716	1391795	107659	4.0	Falls below expectations .	" National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon 1 " is a " Naked Gun " / " Hot Shots ! " style spoof of buddy-cop / action movies with lots of verbal and visual jokes . Veteran detective Wes Luger ( Samuel L . Jackson ) , a stable family man , is partnered with off-the-wall , crazed colleague Jack Colt ( Emilio Estevez ) and they investigate the case of a plot to turn cocaine into Wilderness Girl cookies ( ! ) . Maybe the movie needed better writers , I don't know . I used to laugh a little more at this movie , but viewing it critically for the first time ( I'm starting to demand a little more from what I watch ) I think that there is too much material in this movie that produces little to no laughs . There ARE some good laughs , of course , but it's really a rather flat comedy . The movie's comic performances are pretty much tolerable across the board ( except for Emilio Estevez - he proves that his brother Charlie Sheen ( who has a cameo ) is better at this sort of thing than he is ) , although Jackson is so good I wish he would think about doing more comedies . Frank McRae also gets some knowing laughs as the Stereotypically Angry Captain ( " I'm the captain . I'M supposed to do all the yelling ! " ) . Features uncredited cameos by two big time celebrity actors . Maybe we should be glad there's been no sequel ( that I know of ) despite the many jokes in the movie about an obligatory sequel to come .
398873	1391795	118661	5.0	Some Of You Will Obviously Prefer To Skip The Film And Just Have Tea .	Umpteenth big screen version " inspired " by a vintage TV series ; here , the titular spies John Steed ( Ralph Fiennes ) and Dr . Emma Peel ( Uma Thurman ) work to thwart the maniacal plans of Sir August De Wynter ( Sean Connery ) to control the Earth's weather . I actually didn't find it to be the monumental bomb that many believe it to be . It's a highly irreverent - I would even say silly - spy movie with too much reliance on visual gimmicks and special effects . It has a top-notch British supporting cast , Fiennes is OK but nothing special , Thurman is sleek , sexy and oh-so-appealing , but Connery is actually monotonous ( in a real teeth-gnashing kind of way ) as the nasty bad guy . Maybe I AM really too easy to please at times , but it actually started to get fun for me during the climax . I wasn't overly impressed with the script , though : the screenwriter was obviously working overtime to be as witty as possible . I don't know this for a fact , having never seen the TV series , but is it safe to assume this movie is NOTHING like it ? At least Patrick Macnee , star of the series , is around to contribute a much-needed voice-only cameo .
399880	1391795	83960	5.0	Look out , Chuck's on the warpath again . . .	Enjoyably , hilariously cruddy martial arts / action / revenge saga , ridiculously routine and predictable . Norris , who doesn't even bother TRYING to deliver an actual performance in the movie ( although his silly narration is a funny touch ) , plays a debt collector and security chief for a Hong Kong casino . The stupid son of the casino's father-figure boss gets in deep with mafia goons , led by Stan Raimondi ( Michael Cavanaugh ) , and because the mob boss is the kind of thug who " won't take no for an answer " , both the father and the son end up dead . So what does Chuck do ? Exactly what he's supposed to do in every other film of this kind . He travels the trail of corruption right up to the top ( even Raimondi is answering to someone higher ) ; in a series of repetitive scenes , he goes to see a shady criminal type , and invariably , the shady criminal type refers him to somebody else until finally Chuck finds out who's really in charge . Of course , the main purpose of any Chuck Norris film is to watch the guy in full martial artist mode , swiftly and brutally administering punishment to any half-wit thug stupid enough to take him on . ( One admittedly funny gag is similar to the " shooting the swordsman in the head " classic from " Raiders of the Lost Ark " . ) One thing I've noticed is that in some of his other films Chuck has at least had a good supporting cast to back him up . Here , however , some of the other actors are even worse actors than he is , and some of the non-English speaking performers are horribly dubbed . I really , truly believe that this is a stupid film , but at least it was stupid enough to give me plenty of laughs .
399020	1391795	384833	5.0	" Hey , you look good for a girl covered in giant fish brains . "	Ridiculous but amusing direct-to-video B-movie junk . An odd and patently dangerous new variety of fish appears in swamp country and proceeds to devour the locals . A medical examiner ( Tory Kittles ) and a biologist ( China Chow ) are probing the murder of a local and soon find out what it is that they are up against . As usual for this type of film , the monster itself is an animated creation , but it is wisely kept in the dark a good deal of the time , which helps it to be more menacing instead of just provoking laughs . " Frankenfish " ( an appropriate title for such a silly romp ) works for me on its simple little level because the filmmakers make the smart move of not taking themselves too seriously . It's fairly predictable , although there was at least one death that I was not expecting . The unexpected appearance of a few familiar faces ( Muse Watson ( the fisherman from the " I Know " and " I Still Know What You Did Last Summer " films ) , Richard Edson ( as a dread locked stoner white guy ) , Mark Boone Junior , Tomas Arana , and Marco St . John ) was sort of the drawing card for me , other than the chance to see Chow again , an actress who doesn't appear in film often enough to suit me . The comic highlight has to be the impromptu barbecue that sets up an important plot twist . Co-star Matthew Rauch is stuck in the obligatory role of " The Annoying Character " , i . e . the one character who we will NEED to see die before the final credits roll . When all was said and done , I can't deny that this stupid little film was kind of a hoot .
399776	1391795	305711	5.0	Speak Now , Or Forever Hold Your Peace .	Young couple Tom ( Ashton Kutcher ) and Sarah ( Brittany Murphy ) meet cute at the beach and , on an emotional high , get married soon after . The main premise of the movie is that their honeymoon turns out to be a disaster . . . There are a number of awkward and boring moments in the first half , but it gets a little better as it goes on . When all was said and done , however , I didn't laugh a whole lot . The movie manages to coast for much of its running time based on the very likeable young actors in the leads . It's Kutcher who manages to get most of the laughs ; he can get laughs with just a facial expression ! I don't think it's really that good but I also find it a hard picture to hate . At the very least , those who are so inclined can enjoy that beautiful European scenery . I feel bad for actress Veronica Cartwright . Appearing uncredited ( as Sarah's mother ) , she has to utter the movie's stupidest line . Are there any people in real life with the same nickname as her character ? Mainly noteworthy for the fact that Kutcher and Murphy were a couple in real life as well . . . for a bit . Now of course , his star's shot into the stratosphere because he's dating Demi Moore . Anyway , I gave this one . I heard that critics everywhere tore this movie to pieces , but come on , give me a break , what were they expecting ? " Roman Holiday Part Two ? "
398801	1391795	47898	5.0	Bela Lugosi is a treat to watch in this one .	Ed Wood strikes again with this silly creature feature about maniacal Dr . Vornoff ( Bela Lugosi , an absolute delight ) , who's created a " monster " , an octopus that he periodically lets loose into the local swamp . Of course , the monster snacks on a few hapless victims here and there , prompting stubborn , pushy , and super-obnoxious reporter Janet Lawton ( Loretta King ) to come up with fantastical stories about the disappearances . Janet herself is taken by Vornoff's lumbering manservant Lobo ( Tor Johnson ) , so that she may be the title character , but her detective boyfriend Dick Craig ( Tony McCoy ) comes to the rescue . What I like about " Bride of the Monster " and its brethren is that , even if it can be said that they're lacking in technical quality , they at least have a real sense of fun to them . They have that hard-to-resist " midnight movie " appeal and in fact would probably play best at that time of night . It's utter schlock , but is still undeniably amusing . Playing no small a part in my enjoyment is Bela Lugosi , looking so happy to be getting work that he gives his mad scientist role everything he's got , even delivering a touching moment when at one point he declares that he " has no home " . Both Johnson and Harvey B . Dunn , also looking like he's enjoying himself as Captain Robbins ( his lovably ridiculous gimmick is the pet bird often perched on his shoulder ) are a real gas as well . Paul Marco plays his signature role of Kelton the cop for the first time here . I can't say much for McCoy or King , although it must be said that she does play obnoxious well . Much of the unintentional humor here derives from whenever actors have to perform with the inert prop meant to be the monster . They basically have to do all the work while the octopus just sits there ! Frank Worth's music , an actually fairly tense moment involving Dick and an approaching alligator , and a reasonable stab at creating atmosphere all work in this film's favor . While I'm not going to argue that " Bride of the Monster " is particularly good , I don't think it's all that terrible either . It may not be made with that much skill , but it's made with heart , and sometimes that does in fact count for something .
398641	1391795	56875	5.0	Watch and truly be appalled !	The breakthrough film for Herschell Gordon Lewis , a crafter of shock / schlock cinema who held nothing back and didn't just imply violence , he showed it in all of its tacky , outrageous , gruesome glory . Mal Arnold is Fuad Ramses , a caterer preparing an Egyptian blood feast to appease his god Ishtar . His secret ingredients are not too hard to figure out . Suffice it to say , he gets right down to business , as does Lewis , diving head first into a scene of depravity right off the bat , as a sexy young lady is brutally mutilated in her own bathtub . The acting is pretty non-existent in this movie that is quite literally a mess : most of it is just plain old laughable , especially when characters are called upon to show grief . I can't remember the last time I saw such incompetent emoting . In the context of this kind of film , however , it just adds to the enjoyment . While this film is of course lacking in any sort of artistic merit , that is entirely the point . And I found it appealing - well , so to speak - on the level of the best / worst indefensible trash . Any viewer not encumbered by squeamishness , or prone to being easily offended , would be advised to check this vanguard splatter flick . I say check it out . You'll be glad you did .
399302	1391795	85224	5.0	" I don't want one word of this leaking out . . . "	A monster spawned by nuclear waste terrorizes a rural Idaho community . A detective ( William Osco ) and a dubious scientist ( Martin Landau , who couldn't possibly have sunk lower than this ) team up to stop it . Rock-bottom creature feature , not just a B movie but , as Leonard Maltin's movie and video guide so succinctly puts it , a Z movie . This would be the kind of movie you'd get together with friends and get drunk to while laughing your behind off . The veteran and esteemed performers in this fiasco ( Landau , Jose Ferrer , Dorothy Malone , Ruth Buzzi ) must have been embarrassed beyond belief , but then , those paychecks have to keep coming in , right ? They should have played this with more sarcasm and irony , but unfortunately make the mistake of taking themselves seriously . Too bad . Former porno movie maker William Osco , married to writer / director Jackie Kong at the time this was made , co-stars as the heroic detective Mortimer Lutz using the pseudonym " Rexx Coltrane " . As you can see , he's not really an actor , but does that really matter in a pile of junk like this ? It just adds to the ineptitude and enjoyment ! ( By the way , Osco goes through so much punishment while fighting the creature at the end , you'd think he and Kong were having a fight while they were making this ! ) The monster itself is pathetic . . . very pathetic . Instead of screaming when one sees it , you may be busting a gut laughing . Roxanne Cybelle Osco , presumably the offspring of the film-makers , is the cute little tyke who gets too close to the beast at one point . Other Jackie Kong misfires of the 1980's include " Night Patrol " , " Blood Diner " , and " The Underachievers " . Since it's so crummy that it's fun , it gets from me .
398947	1391795	113501	5.0	Looking For " Just Cause " To Watch This Movie ? Read On .	African-American death row inmate Bobby Earl Ferguson ( Blair Underwood ) appeals to Harvard law professor Paul Armstrong ( Sean Connery ) to get him released from prison because , after all , he didn't commit the murder he was convicted of - yeah , I know , that's what they all say . Armstrong does some investigating down in the Florida Everglades with Lt . Tanny Brown ( Laurence Fishburne ) , the lawman who coerced Bobby Earl into confessing . Paul finds that things are not as they seem with this case - sound familiar ? The biggest problem here is that this is NOT a faithful film adaptation - lots of changes are made from John Katzenbach's fine novel , starting with making the main character a law professor instead of an investigative journalist , as well as casting the 60-something Sean Connery in the lead when the character in the novel was considerably younger . One significant change is stupid and makes no sense . In that sense it IS a disappointment , but if you haven't read the novel and / or don't intend to , this may hold up as an acceptable albeit forgettable thriller . The cast gives exemplary performances , especially Fishburne and a riveting Ed Harris , that are better than the film really deserves . Co-star Christopher Murray , who plays J . T . Wilcox , is the real-life son of Hope Lange ( who has a small part here ) and Don Murray . Also , that's current " it " girl Scarlett Johansson ( " Eight Legged Freaks " , " Lost in Translation " ) as Connery's daughter . This is a routine movie without the same impact as the novel - it's not as compelling despite some upsetting subject matter . I don't think it's quite as slick as other , similar Hollywood films , either .
399640	1391795	203830	5.0	You might as well read a book instead .	Luke Sinclair ( Chris Sarandon ) is a novelist who specializes in serial killer stories ; despite his uncanny knack for getting into the heads of these degenerates , he claims he does no research ; he simply is good at seeing things from their point of view . Luke , suffering from a bad case of writer's block , retreats to rural Maine ( this film was actually shot in the Canadian province of New Brunswick , which is certainly close enough to Maine geographically ) . Instantaneously , a series of sex-related murders occur that seem to be patterned after the kills in " Reaper " , a previous Sinclair novel . Sexy state detective Catherine Mary Stewart and local sheriff Vlasta Vrana represent the law in this story that trods on awfully familiar thriller turf . I wouldn't consider it inept - it's made well enough - but it just seems too routine to work overall . The actors are good - veteran character actor Vrana gets a rare featured role here - but their roles are absolutely nothing special . All revelations made here are not exactly earth-shattering ; there's an obvious red herring and there's not a single story twist here that no-one could see coming . Just another paint-by-the-numbers B-grade thriller ; it might serve its purpose for less demanding viewers but if you want something original look elsewhere .
398782	1391795	94597	5.0	Maybe a cameo from Freddy himself could have redeemed it . . .	For a horror fan , the idea of watching something directed by genre icon Robert Englund might be too good to pass up , but this picture doesn't have much going for it besides novelty value . " 976-Evil " tells the story of much-abused , uber-nerdy outcast ' Hoax ' Wilmoth ( Stephen Geoffreys , who actually isn't as over-the-top weird as he was in " Fright Night " ) , and his ' cool ' , rebellious cousin Spike ( Patrick O'Bryan ) , both of whom dial this goofy , gimmicky service that dispenses advice on how to deal with one's problems . Spike is able to use it to his advantage , but ' Hoax ' is so impressionable that his repeated use of the service turns him into a demonic , freaky-looking imp that , while he is finally able to sadistically punish his tormentors ( incidentally , they're all part of Spike's circle of friends ! ) , we know that nothing good can come of this . Helping to firmly establish the obvious inspiration from " Carrie " , ' Hoax ' is saddled with an overly religious nut-job of a mother ( film veteran Sandy Dennis ) , who , much like Piper Laurie in that other movie , was probably encouraged to go for broke in her performance . Alas , as another reviewer pointed out , she's more annoying than anything else , and a viewer may grow impatient to see her get her comeuppance . Overall , the film doesn't have much intensity , or pizazz , with no memorable set pieces , although I liked the opening sequence , the scene near the end which visualizes well the concept of a literally ' h frozen over ' room , and ' Hoax''s makeup , which is a little inventive , not quite the usual demonic makeup . Some of the sets are also impressively disgusting and seedy . Some performances are acceptable , some of them inept , and the writing ( future Oscar winner Brian Helgeland , who also had contributed to " A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 : The Dream Master " prior to this , was one of the credited writers here ) has its share of flaws . The ending actually isn't that bad , but when all is said and done , the picture emerges as a little underwhelming . At least it has a great little cameo for Robert Picardo . ( Also worth noting is that Englund's wife at the time plays the diner waitress . ) Not bad , but it could have been better .

Elderly Pauline Christophe lives in a nice old mansion atop a mountain where , yes , there is a skull visible in the rock . She arranges for four strangers - her kin - to come to the mansion , and after she passes away , the four experience a series of strange , voodoo-related occurrences . Minor African-American themed horror movie has some atmosphere and an entertaining music score going for it . It also has some likable characters and performances . Victor French ( ' Little House on the Prairie ' , ' Highway to Heaven ' ) is an interesting lead , and the classy looking Janee Michelle definitely has some appeal . Also prominent in the cast is Mike Evans of ' All in the Family ' and ' The Jeffersons ' to provide some comic relief . The film moves along well enough although the climactic voodoo ceremony goes on a little too long . It also could have used a touch more mystery . As a 1970's era B movie , I didn't think it was too bad . It kept me interested enough , and , to be sure , one just doesn't see films like this nowadays .
399821	1391795	183766	5.0	Interesting as a curio , in any event .	Albert Rose ( Leslie Marlowe ) is a macho young dude who gets blackmailed by a kinky weirdo named Dominita ( Dorian Wayne ) into being Dominitas ' in-drag live-in maid . Turns out , Dominita does this to other folk as well , including her lesbian secretary Ruth ( Wendy Roberts ) , whom Albert finds himself falling for , even as he gets quite used to the charade . Determining to break free of Dominitas ' grip , he and Ruth work to expose their boss's not-too-subtle " secret " . This low-budget Miami-filmed trash marked the feature film directorial debut of Bob Clark , whose notable career would include such subsequent efforts as " Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things " , " Deathdream " , " Black Christmas " , " Porky's " , and " A Christmas Story " . As such , I felt I would check it out . Ultimately , it's highly amusing if not exactly " good " . It purports to be a " serious " examination of alternative lifestyles , in the hopes of obtaining greater understanding from the viewer and the world at large . This comes complete with the lead-in " factual exposition " from a supposed expert in these matters , which just makes the whole silly movie even more amusing . Of course the acting is not particularly good , and the movie is overall an uneventful and inauspicious debut for its late , celebrated director . The curious might want to try sitting through it ; all I advise is to keep expectations very low .
399450	1391795	84695	5.0	" What's the damage ? " " Six . . . so far . "	Escaped mass murderer Russ Thorn ( Michael Villella ) , with the aid of a portable power drill , slaughters the air-headed teenagers in a suburban neighborhood . That's all the plot there is . Unbelievably , this movie was directed and written by women ( Amy Jones and feminist author Rita Mae Brown respectively ) . I don't know what their intention was . Is this supposed to be a parody ? A horror comedy ? They didn't seem to have their tongues in their cheeks - I mean , the film seems to be taking itself seriously . All Jones and Brown have really done with " The Slumber Party Massacre " is to serve up the kind of ingredients that some fans of this stuff really salivate for : T & A and gore . That's ultimately the problem with " The Slumber Party Massacre " . It's virtually indistinguishable from other films of its kind , so whatever Jones and Brown had planned , the result is just another slasher film . Thorn's weapon of choice IS a little innovative - I mean , usually in slasher movies , all the killer ever uses is some sort of sharp object - a knife , an ax , what have you . And the sequence with the pizza boy ( played by co-producer Aaron Lipstadt ) is sort of memorable . The movie is quite gory , not very suspenseful ( despite all the darkness for the killer to lurk in ) , and very , very short . Acting is about what you would expect for a B-grade slasher : uninspired , although some of these ladies are good screamers ; features an early appearance by attractive B-movie veteran Brinke Stevens . Perhaps most surprisingly , the final showdown is better than I would have expected . " The Slumber Party Massacre " is ultimately silly , routine , and clichéd , and I'll be frank , it IS sleazy , exploitative trash - but that's what makes some of these films fun . It's light years removed from the more classy thrills of films like " Psycho " and " Halloween " , but it has something . Followed by two sequels .
399064	1391795	83690	6.0	Unexceptional , but basically watchable thriller .	As the film opens , a young woman is electrocuted in her bathtub . Shortly after that , another young woman , Kaylie Bedford ( Suzanna Love ) is struck by a car and receives brain damage . Thanks to the Frankenstein-like machinations of one Dr . Clavius ( a grumpy looking Tony Curtis ) , brain waves from the murdered woman are used to help restore Kaylies ' normal functions and allow her to rehabilitate . But now Kaylie's got some of this other womans ' memories in her head , and husband Julian ( Keir Dullea ) goes about solving the crime on his own to try to help out his wife . While not particularly good or memorable , " BrainWaves " ( from Ulli Lommel , director of " The Boogey Man " ) gets by thanks to some of the acting . Both Dullea and Love are appealing protagonists , although Curtis looks throughout as if he simply wants to get to the bank and cash his paycheque . The wonderful Vera Miles of " Psycho " fame ( whose name in this film is Marion , incidentally ) , character actor and trailer narrator supreme Percy Rodrigues and prominent ' Cheers ' barfly Paul Willson round out the main cast . The film has an excellent music score by Robert O . Ragland , and Lommel and crew pull off some great atmospheric shots of The Golden Gate Bridge just so we have no doubts as to where this film is taking place . The pacing is fairly good throughout , and the film wraps up pretty quickly ; one problem , though , is that the mystery to be solved here is a little too easy to figure out . All in all , not bad . It should provide some entertainment for non-discriminating viewers . I liked it well enough .
399507	1391795	95742	6.0	" You Shouldn't Have Buried Me . . . I'm Not Dead . "	Freddy is resurrected - by flaming dog urine , believe it or not - and in short order manages to kill the three remaining Elm Street children . He then turns his attention to a new group of teenaged bozos , but faces opposition from a girl ( Lisa Wilcox ) who turns out to be a formidable opponent . It was with this entry in the series that things changed , not necessarily for the better : Freddy Krueger , and the actor playing him ( Robert Englund ) became the full-fledged star instead of a supporting player . He became a lot less scary after being given too many lines ( including some groan-inducing one-liners ) and too many scenes ( including some well-lit ones ) . Reasonably entertaining ; not the least of the Elm Street movies but missing the element of fear needed to make it truly succeed . It really is a lot more amusing than frightening . Saved from being just average by excellent special effects - including a creative death scene for one poor girl ( Brooke Theiss ) as well as Freddy's " death " scene . The short-lived " Nightmare " TV series debuted somewhere around this time .
399756	1391795	91387	6.0	If this comedy doesn't scream " turn off your brain before watching " , I don't know what does .	Salesman George Lollar ( Charles Grodin ) loses an important account , and when his boss is understandably enraged , George figures it's about time to take the family on a Christmas vacation . And he picks an island resort named Club Sand , where obviously rampant obnoxiousness and decadence is the name of the game . The writers of " Revenge of the Nerds " concocted this light-hearted and overwhelmingly ridiculous if undeniably breezy affair that coasts as far as it can on the talents of its incredible cast . Don't look for a plot . . . there really isn't one at all , it's just more of a collection of comedy set pieces ( not to mention in-your-face stereotypes ) . The soundtrack of bouncy and cheesy pop tunes does add to the spirit of the thing . Overall , it's hard to completely resist despite its relentless silliness . The humor may not be very inspired , but the movies ' go-for-broke attitude and fast pace at least prevent it from being what I would consider boring . Grodin is in fine form in a typical Grodin role , as he finds himself unable to deal with such escalating lunacy . Robin Pearson Rose is his wife , Megan Mullally his oversexed daughter ( she does a very Karen Walker-like voice here ) , and John Ashton a strident fellow tourist . There's several familiar faces in small roles , including Ian Abercrombie , Brenda Bakke , Gerrit Graham , Phil Hartman , Jon Lovitz , and Mario Van Peebles . From Roger Cormans ' company Concorde , with comedy actress Zane Buzby making her directorial debut and last performance to date ( in a cameo as the slothful babysitter ) .
399067	1391795	275067	6.0	A fairly decent film - it has its flaws as well as assets .	Big city couple George ( Jake Weber ) and Kim ( Patricia Clarkson ) , with young son Miles ( Erik Per Sullivan ) in tow , travel to the snowy wilderness to stay at a friends ' place for the weekend . Their collision with a deer , and subsequent confrontation with some boorish local hunters , become the catalysts for the awfully strange events that are to follow . I'll get my concerns with the film out of the way so I can get on to the good stuff . I'll be honest ; it tried my patience for a while . Its pace was a little too leisurely . I also felt that the director , Larry Fessenden , got a little too fancy at times with his editing and camera movements . I felt that it was distracting , although , to be fair , it also lends the film a certain unnatural air . On the plus side , Fessenden ( who also wrote and edited ) maintains a powerfully ominous mood and incredible sense of foreboding . The actors , including young Sullivan , do a solid job , creating likable enough if not terribly interesting characters . Fessenden also gives the film a commendably ambiguous appeal - just what exactly in the film is real and what is imagined is never laid out for us . We're treated to some amusing if low-budget effects as the title Native American spirit plays a key role in the story . Michelle DiBuccis ' music is also quite excellent . Finally , it was refreshing as it always is for me to watch an unpredictable film where I couldn't be certain where it was going . Overall , it's pretty thoughtful and a fairly intriguing film if not completely satisfying . I'll give credit to Fessenden for crafting something that is definitely not a typical modern horror film .
399924	1391795	47966	6.0	Fun if forgettable .	Six members of the Air Force are on leave in Asia , during WWII , during which time one of them gets the bright idea to sneak into a ritual performed by local snake worshipers . As you can expect , they get found out , and a curse is placed upon them . When they finish their tour of duty and return to the States , they start dying off - each bitten by a cobra . I have to admit , the title was what drew me into this one . It sounds like fanciful , campy fun , and that's pretty much what the movie delivers . The mystery element is very unsuccessful , despite the filmmakers ' attempts to be subtle - it's very easy to figure out what's going on and what gorgeous stranger Lisas ' ( Faith Domergue , of other 50's genre fare like " It Came from Beneath the Sea " and " This Island Earth " ) big secret is . But at least it's a highly amusing variation on murder mysteries ( the " cobra vision " is an engaging little gimmick ) , played straight by its capable cast , including Richard Long , Marshall Thompson , Jack Kelly , and David Janssen . The idea that assorted animals in the movie - a dog , a cat , a horse - can sense the evil presence was another mildly amusing twist as well . The music , atmosphere , script , and direction are all perfectly adequate . Although the finale is ultimately underwhelming , it doesn't put too much of a damper on a fun minor Universal 50's genre flick . One may have to be partial to this sort of movie to begin with , but I'll come right out and say that I enjoyed it .
399564	1391795	105217	6.0	" Hickory , dickory , dock , Cain has picked his lock . . . "	The incredible work by star John Lithgow is the anchor of this psychological thriller from writer / director Brian De Palma . Lithgow plays multiple roles in this story about brothers who perform nefarious deeds for their demented father , and the wife ( Lolita Davidovich ) , who discovers the plot while simultaneously reigniting a sexual relationship with a former lover ( Steven Bauer ) . There are enough twists and turns in this elaborate movie that at first may have a viewer wondering just what is going on . De Palma's script is muddled , but writing isn't his greatest strength . ( I haven't seen all of his thrillers , but there are holes in the " Dressed to Kill " script that I would like to see addressed someday . ) Thankfully , he is still a good enough visual story teller and stylist and thanks to his skills and those of his actors ( that's not to mention the typically haunting music score by frequent collaborator Pino Donaggio ) , he reels me in . Although De Palma is already well known for referencing The Master ( a . k . a . Alfred Hitchcock ) in his works , there's actually a shot in here that I recognized from 1981's " Ghost Story " ( directed by John Irvin ) . One De Palma trademark that was , well , interesting , was the use of a " shocking " ending , which helps to end the picture well . Frequent De Palma actor Gregg Henry plays a detective . This is a fairly good - definitely not great - movie that would probably be best recommended to those who already are admirers of this particular filmmaker . If there's one thing that helps it to be more than just average , it's Lithgow's work .
399500	1391795	99044	6.0	Another gratuitous sequel is more like it .	Five years after the events of " 48 HRS . " , police detective Jack Cates ( Nick Nolte ) is in deep you-know-what after repeatedly failing to prove that a criminal mastermind known as " The Iceman " exists . When he learns that " The Iceman " happens to want his old ' pal ' Reggie Hammond ( Eddie Murphy ) dead , he forces Hammond ( who's just about to get out of jail ) to help him out so he can solve the case and hold on to his job . This film isn't bad , but it's unable to duplicate the success of the original . Basically , it's warmed-over , more-of-the-same sequel material . Nolte and Murphy don't even have quite as much chemistry as they did before ( that chemistry evolved out of the two characters ' hostility towards each other in the first movie , and while they still get quite angry with each other at times , the results aren't the same ) . At least , the writers do an interesting job in tying the events of this sequel to those in the first , and there's plenty of explosions , gunfire ( TONS of gunfire ) , and bodies flying through glass to maintain some level of interest . This is more of a standard action / comedy than the first , although I do have to admit that it DID make me laugh at times .
399594	1391795	265029	6.0	So-So .	Romantic comedy that combines a bunch of jokes about the process of promoting a movie , and a conventional romantic plot . Lee ( Billy Crystal ) is hired to persuade broken-up couple ( John Cusack and Catherine Zeta-Jones ) to appear together in order to generate audience goodwill . It seems the last film they did together is being kept hidden by the film's director ( a weird guy played by who else but Christopher Walken ) , and something has to be done to keep the potential viewers happy . This also involves Zeta-Jones's long-suffering sister / assistant ( Julia Roberts ) and her new lover ( Hank Azaria ) . People who appreciate all the Hollywood jokes might like this more than others , because , frankly , the romantic part of the film is rather predictable . The cast makes it worthwhile , at least . Although I was annoyed quickly by Hank Azaria's character ( and the actor's bad attempt at a Spanish accent ) . Alan Arkin is hilarious as Cusack's " wellness guide . " Not bad , not great either . My rating is .
399235	1391795	76630	6.0	Yet another fatal trek into the woods . . .	1970's era , Canadian-made horror / suspense yarn , in the tradition of " Deliverance " , in which five doctors go on a wilderness vacation and are stalked by a backwoods maniac . Shot in Ontario , the movie does have good shots of the Canadian countryside . For me , it never generated any real fear , just some moderate unease and tension . There are memorable images , like the hideous head-on-a-stick gag and the faraway silhouette of the killer on a hillside . The five doctors are not particularly worth rooting for , with the possible exception of Hal Holbrook's Harry ( he's good as always ) ; they spend too much time complaining and sniping at each other . The finale isn't bad but it also goes on a little too long . What kind of hurt it for me was the bad quality of the picture ; it's too hard to see much in the night-time scenes . This is probably an indicator of a low budget . It's surprisingly subtle in terms of violence ; there's not much gore to be seen despite such things as a leg caught in a bear trap and another leg slashed with a knife . This was the first film gig for Carl Fullerton , who went on to work on movies like " Friday the 13th " parts two and three , " Wolfen " , and " The Hunger " . Nice music by Hagood Hardy . Co-star Lawrence Dane , who plays Mitzi , was a producer . I will probably watch this again someday if it comes out on DVD in a better presentation than the bargain-basement version currently available . It may not be too original , or have a lot of depth , but it's an entertaining-enough little movie . Also known as " The Creeper " .
399269	1391795	82677	6.0	Odd , not entirely satisfying , but an interesting effort all the same .	Beverly Hills plastic surgeon Larry Roberts ( Albert Finney ) is losing his clients as of late . They're dying under mysterious circumstances , and Roberts makes it his mission to protect Cindy ( Susan Dey ) , whom he believes will be next . The nefarious plot afoot seems to have something to do with the Reston Corporation , headed by smooth , powerful John Reston ( a dapper James Coburn ) , which is using the medium of television to its utmost advantage . Perhaps what is most noteworthy for me is that Michael Crichtons ' premise was ambitious for its time , foretelling the kind of technology that has actually come to pass in more recent years . He also succeeds in crafting an offbeat mystery where the viewer is discovering things along with the hero , instead of always being two steps ahead . Some sequences have a decidedly strange effect , and these involve the use of a revolutionary weapon that causes people to blank out . These lend the film a surreal quality that adds to the overall unconventional feel of this thriller . The cast gives it a good effort , with the electronic score by Barry DeVorzon lending it a creepy feel . The title song is typical cheesy 80's stuff , but is undeniably catchy . Sets and computer graphics are also quite eye-catching ( not to mention the prospect of a naked Dey being scanned by a computer for an extended period of time ) . While suffering from some significant flaws , I can't just dismiss it either , as it espouses its ideas in a fairly slick and provocative manner , and delivers a fair dose of early 1980's sci-fi entertainment .
399783	1391795	81383	6.0	Fairly good slasher .	A group of children are playing a morbid version of hide and seek in an old run-down building . They corner one of their own , Robin Hammond , relentlessly taunting her , until she perishes in an accident . Unwilling to face any consequences , they each agree to clam up . Six years later , they're high school seniors anticipating their prom . But naturally somebody remembers what they did years ago , and targets them , taunting them with obscene phone calls and eventually escalating into violence . " Prom Night " probably won't completely satisfy some slasher aficionados , because of a low body count , and sparing uses of gore and nudity . ( There is , however , a decapitation near the end that is a memorable highlight . ) It starts out somewhat slowly , saving the horror elements for the latter portion of the picture . It does deliver some good atmosphere ( those darkened school hallways certainly look forbidding ) and suspense , however . There's also an effective series of chase sequences involving snooty character Wendy ( Eddie Benton ) . The story gives us not one but three red herrings , and the final twist allows for one of the sadder endings that I've seen in a slasher film . The repetitive disco sequences certainly help to firmly date this film , although it's still amusing to watch star Jamie Lee Curtis giving her all in those dancing scenes . She's fine as usual , even if we don't get to know her character all that well . Screen veteran Leslie Nielsen , in one of the last serious roles of his before comedy largely overtook his career , doesn't have too much to do , but it's fun to see him in this sort of thing . Benton ( in her last role before adopting the new moniker Anne-Marie Martin ) is perfect as Curtis's nemesis , with good supporting performances by Robert Silverman as off-putting janitor Mr . Sykes , David Mucci as thuggish troublemaker Lou , and George Touliatos as the detective . The actors playing the kids are likable enough , although it seems that Nick ( Casey Stevens ) is the only one harboring any guilt over what happened six years earlier . Overall , a decent , commendable effort by director Paul Lynch and crew , that delivers some standout moments , with a chilling music score by Carl Zittrer and Paul Zaza . Followed by " Hello Mary Lou : Prom Night II " in 1987 , " Prom Night III : The Last Kiss " in 1990 , " Prom Night IV : Deliver Us from Evil " in 1992 , and a remake in
398626	1391795	51570	6.0	Teenagers ! What WILL they think of next ? Giant spiders ? ? ? HA HA HA ! ! !	Two stupid teenagers , in search of the girl's missing father , enter a cave and find an enormous bird spider that inevitably causes a ruckus that forces the local authorities and experts to pursue it and " kill " it . They put it on display in a high school gym ( waiting for some university bigwigs to take it away for study ) , but it wakes up and escapes so all the heroes have to go after it again ! Enjoyable cheap 1950's era drive-in fodder from American International Pictures , silly enough to be fun , horribly and inevitably dated in some ways ( in particular , the lingo ) , but that's actually part of what makes these pictures fun in the present day . Some of the reviews that I've read say the same thing : that it's easier to endure than most of the " giant thing on a rampage " pictures churned out by legendary schlock master Bert I . Gordon . Well , there's still a number of his films that I haven't seen ( although I consider 1977's " Empire of the Ants " to be a real hoot in its ineptitude ) , so I can't say the same yet , but for this kind of film it ISN'T too bad . The teen-aged leads ( many of these teenagers , in the tradition of motion pictures for all time , really look to be in their twenties at the least ) are wholesome and dorky and the adults either macho , know-it-alls ( like the science teacher hero played by Ed Kemmer ) , or hilariously contemptuous and skeptical ( like the sheriff played by Gene Roth ) . The effects are also somewhat better than one might expect . All in all , it's an amusing way to spend ( or should I say kill ) a quick 73 minutes . Although made after some genuine " giant insect / arachnid " classics of the 1950's like " Them ! " and " Tarantula " , and naturally , not being in the same league as those films , there is at least one thing tying it to " Tarantula " : the presence of actor Hank Patterson , who played Josh in that film , and who plays Hugo here . By the way , there's a scene with a movie theater here that enables Gordon to shamelessly promote his other movies from this period , like " Attack of the Puppet People " and " War of the Colossal Beast " . Re-made for cable TV in 2001 , but using only the same title , with a much different plot line , as part of the " Creature Features " series , which did the same thing for other 1950's A . I . P . features , for example , " How to Make a Monster " .
399879	1391795	81259	6.0	Good action , not much else .	The third starring vehicle for former karate champion Chuck Norris from the soon-to-be defunct American Cinema company , " The Octagon " tells the story of Scott James ( Norris ) , whose adopted brother Seigura ( Tadashi Yamashita ) is running a terrorist training camp somewhere in Central America . Also involved is a spoiled-rotten heiress ( Karen Carlson ) who wants revenge against Seigura because of the death of her father at the hands of terrorists . Then there's the reliable , squinty-eyed legendary film villain Lee Van Cleef as the shady character McCarn , Canadian actor Art Hindle as Scott's hot-headed friend A . J . , and Carol Bagdasarian , daughter of singer-songwriter-actor Ross Bagdasarian , as a sexy terrorist-in-training who ultimately tries to redeem herself . " The Octagon " is clearly more ambitious and better produced than a number of similar martial arts thrillers , although its reliance on actual plot and character development tends to make it drag at times . Those who watch these kinds of films for the admittedly well-choreographed fights may have their patience tested at times . Norris basically just does what he usually does . Carlson is fairly awful . Van Cleef probably is the standout performer in this although " The Octagon " is noteworthy for some familiar faces in small parts : B-movie and martial arts veteran Richard Norton plays both " Kyo " and " Long Legs " and a number of the faceless ninjas as well ( he's joked that he must have died a total of eight times in this movie ) . Ernie Hudson , veteran comedian Jack Carter , Brian Libby ( whose next role was as Chuck's psycho nemesis in " Silent Rage " ) , and an unbilled Tracey Walter all turn up as well . " The Octagon " is really not bad for this kind of film , although since it's NOT wall-to-wall action , some folks may find it hard to sit through . This is another of those cases where you could do better and you could do worse .
399313	1391795	82498	6.0	Not Bad For A Slasher Movie .	Virginia " Ginny " Wainwright ( Melissa Sue Anderson ) is one of the " Top Ten " , an exclusive clique of rich kids at the Canadian institution of Crawford Academy . However , what is more noteworthy is the fact that her friends have begun to get killed off - and Ginny thinks that she might be responsible . She's been having blackouts and flashbacks that are linked to a tragic incident in her past . While Leonard Maltin and company consider this to be the absolute lowest point in actor Glenn Ford's career ( he plays Ginny's sympathetic psychiatrist ) the movie itself is fairly unique for the slasher genre . It plays almost as if it were based on a novel and not written directly for the screen - what I mean is that it is actually more dependent on plot and performances than many a slasher movie . It plods along ( it's probably also the longest slasher movie ever made at an hour and fifty-one minutes ) and not all of the murders are as gory as you might expect . In fact , until late in the movie , the goriest sequence is actually the one of the operation Ginny had after the accident . It takes some getting used to , and I wouldn't recommend it to rabid slasher fans - no sex , and , like I just said , not as much explicit violence as in other movies of its kind ( however , there is one funny moment near the end when a character is killed by a blow to the head with a fireplace poker and an obscenely ridiculous amount of blood splashes over the walls ) . Anderson is a reasonably sympathetic lead and there are a few familiar faces in the supporting cast . The writing has the usual fair assortment of flaws - although the movie's final twist is amusing enough to make it somewhat memorable . Other slasher movies filmed in Canada ( which I have reviewed , anyway ) include " Terror Train " , " Prom Night " , and " My Bloody Valentine " . Produced by Canadian producers John Dunning and Andre Link , who also ushered in the first major Canadian horror movie , David Cronenberg's movie " Shivers " ( a . k . a . " They Came From Within " ) .
398968	1391795	73820	7.0	An okay time filler , but finally comes to life in the last dozen minutes or so .	Here's a memorable TV anthology made in the days when the ' movie of the week ' was the big thing , back in the 1970's . It's based on a trio of Richard Matheson stories , with the first two scripted by William F . Nolan , and the third - the most effective - by Matheson himself . If nothing else , it serves as an exemplary showcase for the talented , offbeat veteran actress Karen Black , appearing in all three episodes in a variety of character roles . " Julie " has her playing a spinster-type teacher , taken advantage of by an impossibly creepy student ( Robert Burton ) , who comes on to her , takes her to a drive-in where he slips a drug into her soda , takes her to a hotel , and takes compromising photos of her . He's not done with her yet . . . but she has a surprise in store for him . " Millicent and Therese " features Black as two wildly different siblings at odds with each other . Millicent is a repressed type , similar to Julie in the first story , convinced that Therese ( a flamboyant sexpot ) is a Satanist and murderer and determined to put an end to her wicked ways . Finally , " Amelia " ( based on the Matheson story " Prey " ) stars Black as a lady who can't decide between spending time with her obviously clingy mother and her new boyfriend . The Zuni fetish doll she has purchased for the boyfriend comes to " life " and terrorizes her and attacks her in some highly stylized action scenes ( as has been said before , the makers of 1988's " Child's Play " may very well have been inspired by this tale ) . Each of the stories comes with a twist ending , although I have to say the second story's twist I saw coming pretty much from the start ( and if I saw it coming , you probably will too ) . The best , of course , is saved for last . It's just perfect . I gotta love that final image . It's fair entertainment until those final dozen minutes , and then it really grabs one's attention . In addition to Black , some familiar faces like John Karlen ( ' Cagney and Lacey ' , " Daughters of Darkness " ) , George Gaynes ( ' Punky Brewster ' , the entire " Police Academy " series ) , and Gregory Harrison ( ' Falcon Crest ' ) can be seen in supporting roles . Black , director Dan Curtis , and writer Nolan re-teamed for the theatrical effort " Burnt Offerings " the following year .
399140	1391795	734692	7.0	A good way to start .	This pilot episode for the now legendary series tells the story of Mike ( Earl Holliman ) , who has no memories of his past life and happens upon a small town where there isn't a soul in sight . As night falls , Mike sees one indication after another that there should be people around - yet he still sees nobody . As night falls he becomes increasingly desperate and unstable . Even almost 50 years after this episode first aired , the series holds up today . People who grew up watching it fondly remember it , and those new to checking it out ( such as I , who recently purchased the box set of the entire series ) discover its ability to tell interesting and offbeat stories with memorable revelations in half hour time slots . Holliman does a solid job , for the most part the only person on screen , engagingly delivering his dialog and believably portraying a man increasingly on the edge . His isolation is emphasized at all times ; the camera-work is quite good and Bernard Herrmanns ' score appropriately eerie . I didn't see that sort of revelation coming , either , which was a good bonus . It makes me quite excited to watch the series in its entirety and see some real imagination at work . It's also quite a gas to be able to recognize the " Back to the Future " set , this episode having been filmed on the same exact spot .
398666	1391795	105219	7.0	Good of its type .	Bruce Lee's son Brandon got his first starring vehicle with this routinely written but competently done martial arts / cop flick . Brandon clearly had the looks , physicality , and presence to have had an impressive acting career had it not been cut tragically short on the set of " The Crow " . Brandon is Jake Lo , college student who accidentally witnesses mafioso Antonio Serrano ( a very amusing Nick Mancuso ) blowing away one of his associates . Jake finds out that he can't trust the Feds assigned to the case , so ends up working alongside tough , maverick cop Mace Ryan ( Powers Boothe ) , a man with unrelenting stubborn tenacity . Director Dwight H . Little makes sure this slick action picture never stops moving . It's got all of the gunfire and martial arts choreography ( Brandon was also a fight choreographer on the show ) that a fan could want . It's exciting at times , very straightforward , and even works in a not so subtle message about people needing to live for something and that dying for what one believes in is an honorable thing . The supporting cast is equally fun to watch . Mancuso and Boothe are the real standouts , but also performing their roles well are Kate Hodge as Boothe's sexy female partner , Raymond J . Barry as crooked Fed Frank Stuart , Tzi Ma as nasty , ruthless villain Kinman Tau , Tony Longo as Serrano's imposing henchman , Basil Wallace ( the bad guy in director Little's previous martial arts picture " Marked for Death " with Steven Seagal ) as the hostile Agent Wesley , and ubiquitous action veteran Al Leong as a henchman . Richard Schiff of future ' West Wing ' fame can be seen as an art teacher . " Rapid Fire " is enjoyable action fare and worth watching for any fan of the genre .
399165	1391795	422401	7.0	Doesn't live up to the hype , but it will undeniably please some hardcore horror fans .	A deformed , monstrous , bayou-dwelling psychopath who survived a hatchet to the face as a child lives on to terrorize the really stupid chump victims taking a tour of his domain in the present day . While I wouldn't consider this the second coming of the genre , director Adam Green does show a bit of flair . Made as an obvious homage to the splatter flicks that him and many of us grew up watching , he does stage the various bloody attacks with considerable panache . Any gore hound watching is bound to be pleased to some degree . The picture also has a respectable amount of backwoods atmosphere . Taking place mostly at night , it settles into a pretty consistent groove once it kicks into gear . The characters are so moronic , standard-issue , and pathetic that the killer is the one most people will be likely to be rooting for - but that doesn't make this any different from many of the slasher films of yore . Green was able to get some genuine horror icons to participate in this ; fans will love seeing Robert Englund , Tony Todd ( although these two are relegated to brief , disappointing cameo roles ) and particularly Kane Hodder , portraying the horrific monster as well as its father in flashback scenes . The assorted , expendable victims are played by folks like Joel David Moore , Deon Richmond ( who has some good , funny moments ) , Joel Murray ( brother of Bill M . ) , Tamara Feldman ( she's the one required to give us much of the exposition ) , Mercedes McNab , Parry Shen , and others . Other than the various gruesome dispatches , what I did appreciate about it was its full-steam-ahead approach . It had an energy to it that was enjoyable . The incredibly predictable ending was an unsatisfying letdown , but overall it's an appropriate enough valentine to vintage slasher fare and I had a fairly good time watching it .
399607	1391795	76141	7.0	" I got it . . . I got it . . . I got it . . . I ain't got it . "	Pretty funny Mel Brooks tribute to and spoof of many of Alfred Hitchcock's classics . Brooks himself plays Dr . Richard Harpo Thorndyke , the new head of an insane asylum , who realizes that he is caught in a conspiracy engineered by the staff . Unfortunately , I haven't seen enough of The Master's classic works to identify all the jokes , although I recognized the " Vertigo " and " The Birds " parodies , and , of course , the " Psycho " one . The irrepressible cast of Brooks company regulars is great fun to watch , especially Cloris Leachman as the hideous , lisping Nurse Diesel . It is not always terribly funny , but there certainly are good moments . In one highlight , Brooks himself sings the title song , which he composed himself ; in the " Psycho " send-up , future filmmaker Barry Levinson ( who was one of the writers here ) plays the lazy , insolent hotel bellboy . Veteran Hitchcock collaborator Albert J . Whitlock ( who also did the matte shots for this picture ) has a cameo towards the end . It's likable and fun and definitely good for a number of laughs .
399046	1391795	264508	7.0	Good fun .	Paul Marsh ( Ezra Godden ) is thrust into a nightmare in a coastal Spanish village named Imboca , when a horrible storm does severe damage to a friends ' boat , anchored offshore . When he makes it to the village , he finds that the locals are a very off-putting sort , and of no help whatsoever . As the rain continues to fall , he gets the history of the place from " crazy drunk " , and seemingly the only normal person in the village , Ezequiel ( Francisco Rabal , who is great ) and discovers not only the incredible secrets of the locals , but the truth about himself . Stuart Gordon once again delivers decent B level horror taking its title from a very brief H . P . Lovecraft short story , but being based more closely on another tale titled " The Shadow Over Innsmouth " . The result is a nicely done tale with heavy atmosphere . Production design / art direction and cinematography are excellent ; this is definitely a film with good visuals . The music is quite suitably ominous and the film just builds in intensity as it goes along . It has quite a good feeling of mystery and a heavy accent on mythology and the ultimate revelations are interesting , to say the least . I haven't seen anything quite like " Dagon " , which is definitely a good thing . Godden makes for an enjoyable lead in the sense that he's not quite a conventional variety of hero . He's nerdy , jittery , and not really all that likable , but it's easy to share his befuddlement at his situation . Rabal is quite delightful as provider of some of the exposition ( this was one of his final roles , and the film is dedicated to him ) , and Macarena Gomez is lovely and bewitching as the character of Uxia . The effects are a decent combination of traditional makeup and CGI , and the film has a solidly grim and nasty tone that gives it an extra bit of kick . It's good and engaging outrageousness ; with the help of his old cohorts , producer Brian Yuzna and screenwriter Dennis Paoli , Gordon adds another fine H . P . Lovecraft adaptation to his filmography . Godden and Gordon , of course , would go on to work on another Lovecraft adaptation , the ' Masters of Horror ' entry ' Dreams in the Witch-House ' .
398924	1391795	69951	7.0	A very visceral and intense vengeance-driven Western .	Richard Harris is Sean Kilpatrick , the unlikely sheriff of a small Texas town who always tries to avoid violence . However , he undergoes a major change of heart once Frank Brand ( an excellent Rod Taylor ) , a cold-blooded outlaw , and his nasty gang , cause a ruckus in his town , and lead to the deaths of Kilpatrick's wife and son . Kilpatrick relentlessly tracks them down , even as they cross the border into Mexico , where Kilpatrick's progress is both helped and hindered by Mexican policeman Gutierrez ( Al Lettieri ) , who is also after Brand but wants to do things the legal way . While this Western ( from a story by Samuel Fuller , also the original director but fired after disputes with star Harris ) won't be for everybody because of its grim and sometimes ugly nature , there's no doubt that it hits a real nerve . It doesn't glorify vigilantism and instead works as an examination of how an obsession with " justice " can lead basically good people down a very dark path . As the movie goes on , Kilpatrick displays a newfound proclivity towards ruthlessness . ( Perhaps most interesting is having Brand display a touch of humanity late in the movie as he tries to reach out to his own daughter . ) It also serves as a good contrast between conflicting ideas as Kilpatrick and Gutierrez strike up their rather volatile relationship . Excellent widescreen photography is one asset ; a most amusing supporting cast is another . Neville Brand is great as " Choo Choo " , so named for a rail tie at the end of one limb where his hand used to be . William Smith is interesting as the thuggish but seemingly mentally challenged " Schoolboy " , and Paul Benjamin is fine as Jacob , the dapper black gentleman who for whatever unfathomable reason rides with these men and puts up with a lot of their nonsense . But Taylor is the most fun as the swaggering lowlife who puts the whole plot into motion . The movie is rather slowly paced , but offers a very adult story for Western fans . It packs a rather mean punch and while not particularly memorable , it's still pretty good entertainment .
398718	1391795	98627	7.0	The corpse is the " life " of the party !	Two young insurance company employees , Larry ( Andrew McCarthy ) and Richard ( Jonathan Silverman ) discover an instance of fraud and report it to their boss Bernie ( Terry Kiser ) . Unfortunately for them , Bernie is the one behind the fraud , and he asks his mobster associate to take them out . Unfortunately for Bernie , the mobster sends his hit man to eliminate Bernie instead . Larry and Richard arrive at Bernie's gorgeous beach house for the weekend and , after discovering that Bernie is dead , manage to make it look like he is still alive so that they can enjoy the rest of the weekend . An uncomplicated , very slightly plotted farce that is actually pretty fun if it hits you in the right frame of mind . The whole thing is extremely silly and yet extremely funny at times . McCarthy and Silverman are very lively , but Kiser completely steals the movie as the title corpse . I first noticed this amusing actor on a hilarious episode of ' Three's Company ' , and have remained amused by his performances ever since . However , I think that sad-eyed cult actor Don Calfa ( " Chopper Chicks in Zombietown " , " The Return of the Living Dead " is also worth mentioning , in a good comedy performance as the hit man who grows increasingly flustered in his attempts to kill Bernie once and for all . Catherine Mary Stewart is attractive and appealing enough as the girl Richard is interested in . It also seems to be part satire : a commentary on self-absorbed rich jerks who are so into what they themselves are doing that they can't notice ( or even sense ) that Bernie is dead . The movie's Canadian director , Ted Kotcheff , appears on screen as Richard's father . All in all , a good comedy . I give it .
399781	1391795	80754	7.0	Decent mystery / thriller with exemplary cast as its primary draw .	Detective Barney Caine ( George C . Scott ) gets involved in an increasingly twist-laden plot that begins when an old friend of his is found murdered . As it progresses , he travels to Germany , speaks to a variety of characters , and hooks up with a grieving young woman ( Marthe Keller ) . The story actually began back at the end of World War II and involves the creation of a synthetic fuel which , naturally , certain interests want to stifle no matter what has to be done . It's the actors that really make it worthwhile . The film itself , I thought , had a reasonably engrossing plot . I enjoyed the twists and turns that it took , even if not that many of them were actually surprising . The foreign locale certainly doesn't hurt . The film begins well , and moves slowly - some might feel too slowly for a film without truly effective revelations - towards a rather low-key showdown between the two adversaries . Scott and co-star Marlon Brando , in a typically amusing performance as an oil magnate , don't appear together very often in the film , but their scenes are very effective . Keller is alluring as Lisa , the young woman who knows more than she's letting on . G . D . Spradlin , Richard Lynch , John Van Dreelen , Calvin Jung , Alan North , David Byrd , and Ferdy Mayne all do fine work in supporting roles ; John Gielgud has only one scene but is superb in it . However , Beatrice Straight is wasted in a very minor role . Ike Eisenmann ( from the Disney " Witch Mountain " films of the ' 70's ) and Craig T . Nelson also turn up briefly . Giving this film some sense of relevance of course is its premise , as the film explores subjects still very much on people's minds . It's entertaining enough if not particularly memorable , but works as a meditation on corruption and greed and the machinations of people in certain positions of power .
399162	1391795	93996	7.0	Hot babes , lotsa gore , tons of laughs . . . what's not to love ?	Courtney , the youngest survivor of the original " Slumber Party Massacre " , is now played by Crystal Bernard of ' Wings ' fame . She's a member of an aspiring rock band also consisting of hottie friends Amy ( Kimberly McArthur ) , Sheila ( Juliette Cummins ) , and Sally ( Heidi Kozak ) . Courtney regularly has nightmares about her ordeal ( enabling the film-makers to use a fair bit of archive footage ) , yet is now re-imagining the driller killer as a leather clad rock star ( a hilariously campy Atanas Ilitch ) whose drill is attached to the end of his guitar . And her nightmares somehow start coming real , as the rocker comes after her and her friends . Coming from Roger Cormans ' company Concorde , this is the kind of stuff that you know just ain't that good , but it's definitely good for some entertainment . The girls get crazy , get drunk , have a good time , take off their clothes , their boyfriends show up and clown around - it's all par for the course . The gore is actually pretty good , and there's a lot of it . My favorite is an over-the-top zit gag . Most importantly , writer-director Deborah Brock and company don't take themselves seriously at all . This gets positively goofy at times - the climax is played tongue-in-cheek , with the psycho stopping to do an impromptu musical number in the middle of a pursuit . I have to admit . . . I enjoyed " Let's Buzz " . These silly , sleazy slasher shenanigans are a real hoot .
399595	1391795	24184	7.0	He could be right next to me , now , as I type .	Mad scientist Jack Griffin ( Claude Rains ) has discovered how to make himself invisible . Problem is , a drug included in the formula has also driven him mad , and soon he is terrorizing the English countryside . One of the all-time great Universal chillers , huh ? Well , I am reasonably impressed , even if I didn't find it particularly scary . It's fast-paced , well-acted ( especially by Rains ) and features special effects that are excellent especially when you consider that this film was made over seventy years ago . One of the best things about these Universal monster movies is that they're not long . They're over before you know it , and this movie is no different . Some people may even wish they were longer . Acting honors definitely go to Claude Rains ( this was his film debut ) . Jack Griffin certainly qualifies as one of the more memorable madmen I've " seen " in motion pictures . By the way , for those of you who don't know , a much younger Gloria Stuart , who was so good as the old version of Rose in James Camerons ' " Titanic " , is the leading lady here . For my tastes , this rates a .
399695	1391795	98350	7.0	Somewhat interesting sci-fi fare .	In a typically desolate vision of Earths ' future , there are intimidating winds that now dominate the planet - known as the " slipstream " . Affable , hard-luck dreamer Matt ( Bill Paxton , highly animated as always ) runs into thuggish cop Tasker ( Mark Hamill , clearly relishing the opportunity to be the baddie after being known mainly for playing Luke Skywalker ) . Matt learns that Taskers ' prisoner Byron ( the late , talented Bob Peck , giving the best performance in the movie ) has a hefty price tag attached to him , so snatches Byron away from Tasker and heads right into the slipstream in his little aircraft . This little movie clearly aspires to be something more than a standard sci-fi adventure . It doesn't offer us that many action scenes , or really try to dazzle us all that much . It's more of a story of the journeys , personal as well as physical , that our two main characters , Matt and Byron , are going on . Late in the game , when one would think that a movie of this type would ordinarily be building in intensity , it starts piling on social commentary with two different depictions - essentially , haves ( who are hording works of art ) and have nots ( who turn out to be flakes who worship the winds , or something to that effect ) who each live in seclusion , with the haves of course being able to live in relative comfort . This leads to a rather perfunctory and unmemorable finish . All of this makes for a very unusual and intriguing , if not entirely satisfying , experience . The movie boasts an interesting pedigree : it marked Hamills ' return to feature films ( " Return of the Jedi " had been released six years prior to this ) with Steven Lisberger of " Tron " fame as the director , and Gary Kurtz , producer of " Star Wars " episodes IV and V as the producer here . Elmer Bernstein contributes a soaring , majestic score and the locations are quite breathtaking . The sets have an impressively run-down look to them . One sequence where Byron needs to be rescued plays out as a great set piece ; with the forceful winds and the low light , it truly looks like hell on Earth . Hamill actually does a pretty good job portraying a jaded tough guy type . ( At least , with the peroxided hair and the full mustache and beard , he's certainly got a different look going on here ) . The striking Kitty Aldridge has got a lot of spunk as his equally tough female partner , and such folks as Robbie Coltrane , Roshan Seth , and Ricco Ross have small roles , with two Oscar-winning guest stars in very brief turns : Ben Kingsley and F . Murray Abraham . Peck really emerges as the star of this show , though ; as I've already said , he's obviously quite talented , and it's a shame we couldn't have gotten to see him in more films ( though anyone watching is bound to recognize him as the character Muldoon in " Jurassic Park " ) . An offbeat , reasonably entertaining movie with decent enough production values , " Slipstream " is worth catching for curious viewers .
399365	1391795	60548	7.0	Pretty good stuff .	On a British island , scientists diligently work on a cure for cancer . However , their idea - a creation of a new life form - is no cure . These beings - looking a little like land born versions of the Martian spaceships in " War of the Worlds " - devour bones and turn their victims into " jelly " . A dedicated team of doctors - Edward Judd , Peter Cushing , and Eddie Byrne - seek to find out how to destroy them . A fairly interesting and fanciful plot works for this overlooked little horror item . Even the monsters , as low tech as they may be , are creepy in their own way . Director Terence Fisher draws the viewer in with a sharp sense of mystery until the secrets are revealed , and , in appreciable fashion , maintains a steady pace until the final third when he allows the action to speed up . An effective plot detail - the monsters are capable of multiplying on a regular basis - allows for more tension as the imperiled villagers have time working against them . The island setting is another good touch . The movie leads towards a decent climax , in classic " Night of the Living Dead " fashion , involving a siege . The monsters congregate and swarm over the building where the frightened villagers are holed up . An effective sense of panic is created . Cushing is as solid as always , with likewise fine performances from Judd , Byrne , and Niall MacGinnis . " Island of Terror " is an entertaining little horror film that's worth a look .
399725	1391795	78474	7.0	An entertaining adventure .	Greg Collinson ( Doug McClure ) has devised an experimental diving craft and , along with British scientist Charles Aitken ( Peter Gilmore ) , uses it to explore the depths . They end up in the underwater city of Atlantis , whose citizens intend to have Aitken join them , hoping to exploit his superior intellect . In addition to fighting off assorted monsters , McClure , Aitken , and their associates set off on a daring escape . One could complain about the cheesiness of the whole affair , or the less than stellar special effects , but for me it still adds up to likable , undemanding fantasy escapism . It's quite colorful and interesting . Most importantly , I felt it was reasonably exciting , with decent direction by Kevin Connor and respectable pacing . The monsters may not be that high tech , but I'd still take these kinds of creations over CGI any day . It just adds to the true old-fashioned , Saturday matinée type appeal of the whole thing . Michael Vickers ' rousing score is simply wonderful . McClure is a stolid hero , and the supporting cast is fine . Special guest appearances are made by Cyd Charrisse and Daniel Massey as high-ranking Atlantians . Especially effective is under-rated character veteran Shane Rimmer as Captain Daniels , with Michael Gothard , gorgeous Lea Brodie , Robert Brown , and future ' Cheers ' mailman John Ratzenberger all enjoyable in smaller roles . The kind of picture that we unfortunately just don't see a lot of anymore , " Warlords of Atlantis " is not particularly memorable but is a definite pleasure to watch in any event .
399835	1391795	74768	7.0	Reasonably enjoyable .	Not bad Nazisploitation trash about experiments intended to create a superior race of Nazi soldiers . Young enemy women are brought in to copulate with the studliest young members of the Nazi ranks . It delivers some foul and repellent highlights , with a dedicated cast sinking their teeth into their depraved roles . It's got some graphic gore , and the eye candy quotient is satisfactory , with a respectable amount of nudity as well as some erotic sex scenes . Just to give you some examples of its cruder moments , the particularly virile Helmut ( Mircha Carven ) takes part in a testicle transplant ( against his knowledge ) when an impotent Colonel ( Giorgio Cerioni ) becomes envious . ( It turns out that the Colonel's own manhood was bitten off some time ago . ) One of the lovely young ladies is hung upside down and left to bleed to death , while another is left inside a tank of water ; the temperature is raised and she gets boiled , then it's lowered until she gets frozen solid . Now , I'll admit I found this movie rather slowly paced and talky so it requires some patience on the part of the viewer until it gets to the good stuff . In any event , it ends on a very downbeat final note and has some amusing performances ( particularly by Patrizia Melega as the dedicated Dr . Renke and Attilio Dottesio as the repentant Dr . Steiner ) , not to mention some good laughs . It's got its sillier moments , to be sure , and I can believe that it's not the best of its genre . But it does provide for some amusement for fans of such tasteless junk .
399027	1391795	62168	7.0	Nicely done sci-fi from Hammer Studios .	In modern-day London , a tunnel excavation intended to add extensions to the existing subway system unearths some strange finds . First , a series of skulls and skeletons neither ape nor man , but something in between , possibly dating as far back as five million years ( ! ) . Next , a strange object , possibly a spaceship , containing some locust-like creatures . Dr . Matthew Roney ( an engaging James Donald ) and stolid Professor Bernard Quatermass ( a truly excellent Andrew Keir ) , in between quarreling with stubborn military man Col . Breen ( the highly enjoyable Julian Glover ) , probe the mystery of these discoveries . While for me it took some getting used to the very slow and steady approach of this film , it still provided genuinely intriguing ideas in a thoughtful and intelligent matter . Most intriguing is that science and religion are linked in the concept of a spiritual evil that could be ready to cause destruction on Earth . The increasing sense of desperation and concern that our protagonists feel culminates in a slam-bang finale as the film-makers finally let spectacle take over and give us a doozy of an ending . Better known more for their series of period horror films , Britains ' Hammer Studios did a very respectable job with their foray into the realm of science-fiction . This is a chilling movie with an exemplary music score by Tristram Cary , good underground sets , a fine cast , solid direction by Roy Ward Baker , and an original and provocative script by Nigel Kneale . It's an entertaining movie worth seeking out for discriminating sci-fi / horror fans .
398960	1391795	115610	7.0	Not bad as werewolf movies go .	Country dwelling lawyer Janet ( Mariel Hemingway ) is thrilled when her globe-trotting brother Ted ( Michael Pare ) arrives stateside . However , good old Ted isn't telling her everything that she should know - what we in the audience already know thanks to the prologue . Only Thor ( Primo ) , the family dog , senses something is wrong about Ted . Clocking in at a surprisingly short 80 minutes , " Bad Moon " would never compare to fare such as " The Wolf Man " , " Curse of the Werewolf " , " The Howling " , or " An American Werewolf in London " . Or more recent fare such as " Ginger Snaps " and " Dog Soldiers " , for that matter . Writer / director Eric Red , whose noteworthy genre credits include " The Hitcher " , " Near Dark " , and " Body Parts " , takes his material seriously , and gets good performances out of Hemingway , Pare , and young Mason Gamble as Hemingways ' son . The movie is technically well made , with decent CGI effects and a ferocious looking werewolf . Slick cinematography of the forest setting is also a plus . It's basically fairly enjoyable , and moves along pretty well . It's just not particularly scary or suspenseful and is rather predictable . The best part is Primo , a beautiful and obviously well trained German Shepherd who ends up the main reason to watch the movie . It's not destined to become a classic , but is a watchable enough movie of its type .
398615	1391795	53344	7.0	Better than expected .	This is a fine , moody and stark little horror movie basically taking its plot from " Island of Lost Souls " . Shipwreck survivor William Fitzgerald ( likable enough Richard Derr ) is rescued and brought to the home of island-dwelling scientist Charles Girard ( the effective Francis Lederer ) . Fitzgerald meets Charles's hot young wife Frances ( stunning Greta Thyssen , Miss Denmark in 1951 ) and falls for her , while learning that what Charles is working on is defying the natural process of evolution and slowly turning an animal into a human being . Shot on location in the Philippines ( this was apparently the very first Filipino horror movie ) , director Gerry de Leon and company make the most of their environment . It's a wonderfully minimalist experience and a combination mad scientist and monster movie in the classic tradition . There's lots of shadow ( and therefore lots of atmosphere ) . De Leon goes for the subtle approach all the way through , holding off a reveal of the creature as long as possible . ( Flory Carlos does a commendable job in this role , making the creature both scary and pitiable . ) And the makeup job isn't too bad , either . The one scene of " graphic " on-screen violence most likely wouldn't affect the modern audience at all . It has a rather sedate pace at first but definitely picks up in its final third . Perhaps most interesting is the way that the low-key approach extends to the two male leads . Charles never acts that " mad " , but is quite warm and hospitable for a while and doesn't even mind talking about his work with his guest . Lederer never lets his performance slip too much into camp . And the moral outrage that we would expect from William isn't overdone , either ; rather , although he disagrees with his host , he remains somewhat fascinated in spite of himself . Thyssen does a decent enough job acting , but at the least does provide this movie with very enjoyable eye candy . Oscar Keesee is good as Walter , while Peyton Keesee is appealing as Tiago the boy and Lilia Duran very sexy as Selene . This would make for a fine choice of midnight movie viewing . It's definitely worth watching if you're into this sort of thing .
398789	1391795	115571	7.0	A pretty good small-scale sci-fi thriller .	Charlie Sheen , in a fine dramatic performance , is Zane Zaminsky ( you've gotta love that name ) , a radio astronomer who receives a signal from space . Instead of getting any sort of kudos from boss Phil Gordian ( Ron Silver ) , he gets fired instead . This is just the beginning of Zane's quest , as he tracks the source of a second signal to a remote Mexican location and discovers a nefarious plot concocted by very stealthy aliens that he has to stop - almost all by himself . For those people who do get tired of in-your-face , summer blockbuster type alien invasion movies where spectacle is priority number one ( " Independence Day " was released later the same year as this film ) , " The Arrival " may be your idea of an acceptable alternative . It's really rather subtle , deliberately paced , and even sort of thoughtful . Writer / director David Twohy ( " Pitch Black " ) , making his theatrical film-making debut , makes it clear that he is trying to put this kind of story in a " realistic " sort of mode , in other words , relying more on ' science fact ' than ' science fiction ' , as some people might say . Rarely have I seen Sheen give such an intense , committed performance . He really keeps it interesting . Silver is effectively understated as the vaguely dubious superior - even once he realizes that Sheen is on to him , he doesn't lose his cool , and Lindsay Crouse , Teri Polo , Richard Schiff , Tony T . Johnson , and Leon Rippy round out this cast . The visual and make-up effects are well done , and this is one of the rare cases where they don't take center stage , but are just assisting in telling the story . The creatures are animated creations , but look refreshingly believable as opposed to being patently two-dimensional . The look of the film - especially the underground lair that Zane eventually sneaks into - is worth noting also . It delivers some good suspense at times , aided by a great music score by Arthur Kempel that I definitely enjoyed . In keeping with the tone of the film , the finale is willfully low-key - and ominous in its own way . Followed by a direct-to-video sequel two years later .
399110	1391795	80934	7.0	" You never know what the sea will cough up . "	Indeed . Intriguing tale of modern-day pirates living on a Caribbean island who take journalist Blair Maynard ( Michael Caine ) prisoner - along with his son Justin ( Jeffrey Frank ) , whom they successfully manage to turn against him . These blokes are true leftovers from centuries past , are true primitives , and speak the strangest dialog . This is based on a novel by Peter Benchley , of " Jaws " fame . Benchley scripted himself , fashioning a sometimes nasty adventure that is impossible to take seriously 100 % of the time . Just check out the sequence where the pirates pillage the boat of some drug dealers and you'll see what I mean . In any event , I sure don't see movies like this everyday - or nowadays , for that matter . Surprisingly violent at times , and comical at others , it tells its odd little tale with the assistance of an able cast , all managing to maintain incredibly straight faces . David Warner , as the leader of the tribe , Angela Punch McGregor , Frank Middlemass , Brad Sullivan , and Zakes Mokae co-star , each delivering an amusing performance . Lush island cinematography , stirring Ennio Morricone music , and Albert Whitlock matte shots all qualify as assets as well . Although close to two hours in length , I didn't find it boring at any time , as it moves along rather well , moving towards a very bloody final showdown . Again , you will have to see this to believe it . Yes , I will reiterate that at times it is laughable , but give Benchley credit for his fanciful story . It's still a pretty entertaining piece of work .
399139	1391795	68230	8.0	Typically fine anthology work from Amicus .	Amicus serves up another of their deliciously , ghoulishly fun horror anthologies in this four-story chiller from " Psycho " author Robert Bloch . They each have their own twists , serving as enjoyable punctuation on these nifty little exercises in the macabre . The wraparound story ( which eventually turns into the fourth story , named " Mannequins of Horror " ) sees Dr . Martin ( Robert Powell ) arriving at an insane asylum to interview for a position . He's told by Dr . Rutherford ( Patrick Magee ) that the former head of the asylum , Dr . Star , has gone mad and become a patient . He proposes that Dr . Martin will visit with four of the particularly disturbed patients on the upper floor , and if he can deduce which one is Dr . Star , he will obtain the position . " Frozen Fear " stars sexy Barbara Parkins as Bonnie , having an affair with Walter ( Richard Todd ) . Walter proceeds to get wife Ruth ( Sylvia Syms ) out of the way , but she's been taking voodoo lessons and has a surprise in store for the two lovers . " The Weird Tailor " stars Barry Morse as Bruno , desperate to come up with rent money , who receives an offer from mysterious Mr . Smith ( Peter Cushing ) to make a very unique suit , with very specific instructions to follow . When Bruno goes to Smiths ' place to deliver the suit and collect his money , he discovers the horrific truth about both Smith and the suit . " Lucy Comes to Stay " stars two gorgeous ladies , Charlotte Rampling and Britt Ekland , as Barbara and Lucy respectively . Barbara has come home from a mental hospital stay , and her friend Lucy is now spurring her to escape , insistent that Barbaras ' brother George ( James Villiers ) does not have her best interests at heart . After an escape attempt turns bloody , the true nature of the Barbara-Lucy relationship comes to light . " Mannequins of Horror " prominently features Herbert Lom as Byron , who's fashioning some exquisitely detailed little toys , into one of which he intends to transfer his own soul . As the toy gets loose and goes about a deadly business , Dr . Martin finally thinks he's solved the mystery but turns out to be sorely mistaken . Fun from beginning to end , these neat and nasty little tales are told in tight and trim running times , and each revelation is no less than entertaining . Granted , some of the twists may come off as obvious , but getting to them is still enjoyable . The whole movie adopts a playful approach ; horror veteran Roy Ward Baker directs well and gets wonderful performances out of his star-laden cast . It's also a delightful guessing game for the viewer as well as Dr . Martin ; interactivity is always a nice hook for a movie , and " Asylum " is no exception . Nicely accentuated by Douglas Gamleys ' grandiose music score , it moves along efficiently towards a satisfyingly morbid conclusion . I definitely recommend " Asylum " to fans of the anthology format .
399150	1391795	63170	8.0	My first dose of J-horror .	During the latter part of the 19th century , when some parts of Japan were being Westernized , some parts were still deeply rooted in the past . The story here has a cruel land-owning family seizing the property of a deeply-in-debt farmer . In an ongoing series of tragedies , the farmer dies , his wife and daughter are enslaved , the wife dies when trying to prevent the killing of a snake ( it's considered bad luck to kill a snake ) , and the daughter is assaulted by the son of the landowner . Eventually , the spirits of the farmer and his family materialize in a quest for revenge . This Japanese shocker is equal parts devastating , surreal , and eerie . It's artfully and skillfully made , with lush , impressive , widescreen cinematography and excellent sets . Imagery is powerful and likely to provoke strong reactions from the viewer . The acting is impressive ; it's all too easy to deeply sympathize with this poor farming family and root for them to take their revenge , as well as hating the landlords . ( There's also a heavy dose of comedy relief , mostly in the form of the character Kame . ) Director Nobuo Nakagawa , considered the father of J-horror , and whose credits include the 1960 classic " Jigoku " , combines all the elements very well to create a memorable movie with elements of melodrama and the supernatural . The ghosts here don't directly cause the ruination of the villains , but are manifestations of their guilt , causing them to bring about their own ends , creating a strong psychological quality . The result is a pretty effective movie that is clearly not that well known and could use a little more exposure . Any horror fans fond of the Japanese takes on the genre would be advised to check it out .
398587	1391795	72325	8.0	A fun and funky blast of choice blaxploitation .	Cooler-than-cool Isaac Hayes essays the title role here , a slick former football pro turned skip tracer . He and partner Jerry ( amiable Alan Weeks ) go after thuggish pimp Gator ( Paul Harris ) and are forced to shoot and kill the cretin when he refuses to go quietly . This incurs the lethal wrath of Gators ' woman Dorinda ( Nichelle Nichols , a long , long way from Lt . Uhura of ' Star Trek ' and a lot of fun as a foul-mouthed and very nasty dragon lady villainess ) . She appeals to her fellow lowlifes to bump off Truck , not the least of which is super-smooth Harvard Blue ( Yaphet Kotto ) . " Truck Turner " is one of the livelier movies of its kind that I've seen . Director Jonathan Kaplan doles out energetic action sequences that unfold at a breakneck pace , including both car chases and fight scenes . It's also humorous at times ( check out the " funeral for a pimp " sequence ) and offers a smashing climax with one hilarious gag of a blood bag being shot during an operation ( ! ) . The music , naturally supplied by Mr . Hayes himself , is the perfect accompaniment . Kotto is solid as always and a fine presence on screen , while Annazette Chase is one very sexy lady and an appropriately spunky love interest for our lean and mean hero . There are plenty of familiar faces filling out small roles admirably , including Charles Cyphers , Dick Miller , " Scatman " Crothers , Stan Shaw , Henry Kingi , Don Megowan , Matthew ' Stymie ' Beard , and Kaplan film regular Johnny Ray McGhee . A no-foolin ' around , engaging dose of 70's grooviness , " Truck Turner " hits the spot for fans of the blaxploitation genre .
399430	1391795	106519	8.0	A great crime drama with a typically fine Al Pacino performance .	Pacino plays Carlito Brigante , a former criminal who gets out of prison after a five year stretch . He's vowed to go straight , and hooks up with old flame Gail ( Penelope Ann Miller ) while enjoying a new gig as the boss of a night club . However , his loyalty to his hopelessly corrupt attorney Dave Kleinfeld ( an excellent Sean Penn ) proves to be unwise . In addition , he finds that the code of honor that he lives by no longer counts for much in a world that's changed from the one he's used to . Even at two hours and 24 minutes , this gritty , downbeat , and ultimately very poignant crime drama is compelling every step of the way . The violence is in the service of the story instead of the other way around , which makes it all the more effective . Director Brian De Palma also does a fine job of immersing us in the environment . The mid-70's period is strongly and amusingly evoked using many of the popular songs from the period . Most importantly , Pacino creates a character that comes off as genuine , honorable , and one that a viewer can root for even as his situation begins spiraling out of control . Carlito may be out of touch and retain values that most other characters seem to reject , but that's just what makes him such a strong character , as he tries to distance himself from the corruption going on around him . The pace never flags ; rather , it moves very well from scene to scene with the kind of dialog where one is compelled to hear every word . It's overall remarkably affecting , eventually escalating into a heart-pumping climax where Carlito is running for his life . Penn does a tremendous job in the role of Kleinfeld ; along with the slightly different look he sports here , he truly becomes this shameless pile of slime , just as crooked if not more than the criminals that he represents . Miller is very endearing in what is far and away one of the most interesting parts that she's ever had . John Leguizamo , as the cocky young upstart Benny Blanco , Luis Guzman , as the increasingly dissatisfied associate Pachanga , Viggo Mortensen , in a heartfelt cameo as a pathetic , wheelchair-bound would-be rat , and James Rebhorn , as the uptight and hard-driving district attorney , comprise a solid supporting cast . Other performers in small parts include Richard Foronjy , Adrian Pasdar , Al Israel , Rick Aviles , film director Paul Mazursky ( in a cool cameo as a judge in the opening minutes ) , Jon Seda , John Finn , and Vincent Pastore . Marc Anthony performs with the Latin band at the disco . This film is a fine achievement for both the director and star . It's riveting all the way through .
399714	1391795	59127	8.0	Christopher Lee makes a triumphant return to one of his best-known roles .	Very entertaining belated sequel to " Horror of Dracula " in which two vacationing couples - Charles ( Francis Matthews ) & Dianna ( Suzan Farmer ) and Alan ( Charles Tingwell ) & Helen ( Barbara Shelley ) - are lured to Draculas ' castle . The good count is resurrected that very night by loyal servant Klove ( Philip Latham ) and proceeds to terrorize the locals all over again . Although it took some convincing to get Lee to reprise the role , it was worth the wait ( a sort-of sequel named " The Brides of Dracula " had been released in between ) . He plays Dracula with utter , mesmerizing menace and the silence of the character makes him much more animal-like ( although , in truth , Lee played the role silent because he thought Draculas ' dialog was abysmal ) . The other actors do fine in support ; as is always the case for Hammer shockers , the ladies present are quite lovely and bewitching , especially Farmer , who also had the additional task of dubbing Shelleys ' screams . Andrew Keir is a solid standout as the gruff , no-nonsense Father Sandor , who proves to be very helpful indeed . The film is quite atmospheric , with darkness effectively blanketing many shots . Nicely shot in Technovision by Michael Reed , with appropriate sets by Bernard Robinson . James Bernard supplies one of his many ominous , grandiose , and unsettling music scores . Genuinely spooky from beginning to end , there's some wonderful suspense to be enjoyed here , as well as some decent effects . The mood is always oppressive and grim , and the climax is incredibly rousing , with an unconventional demise this time for our villain . It's a very good entry in the series . Followed in 1968 by " Dracula Has Risen from the Grave " .
398954	1391795	72225	8.0	A good deal of fun .	Smooth , dapper gangster Morgan ( a most enjoyable Robert Quarry ) desires the nightclub of a man named Langston ( Larry D . Johnson ) . Morgan is yet another of those " I won't take no for an answer " types and has his thugs beat Langston to death . Langston's furious lover Diana " Sugar " Hill ( the impressively gorgeous Marki Bey ) determines that Morgan and his goons will be made to pay . So she hooks up with aged voodoo practitioner Mama Maitresse ( Zara Cully ) , who conjures up the demonic Baron Samedi ( Don Pedro Colley ) , who in turns resurrects a group of zombies that go after the bad guys . The PG rating would explain why this is never as violent or sexy as it could ( and should ) be , but it's still quite a bit of macabre fun . Veteran producer Paul Maslansky , in a rare directing credit , infuses the proceedings with atmosphere . The music is typically dazzling for a blaxploitation flick ; the song " Supernatural Voodoo Woman " is a blast . Bey is a great lead in the Pam Grier mold - just as tough , independent , and sassy as she is sexy . The supporting cast ( also including Richard Lawson and Charles Robinson , ' Mac ' of ' Night Court ' fame ) is entertaining as well . Colley in particular looks like he's having a great time . The zombies themselves , their heads covered in cobwebs , are a nicely spooky and threatening looking bunch . The deaths are successful for suggesting extreme violence without actually showing it . " Sugar Hill " can stand alongside such fare as " Abby " , " Blacula " , and " J . D . ' s Revenge " as a fine and funky blaxploitation / horror combo .
398693	1391795	43456	8.0	Peace And Understanding ? What A Novel Idea .	Klaatu ( Michael Rennie ) , a man from another planet , arrives on earth with a robot companion ( Lock Martin ) with the attention of addressing all the governments of Earth . He wants them to work towards peace and understanding , or Earth will be faced with the prospect of destruction . Forget about the cheesy effects and costumes , and concentrate instead on this movie's intelligence and still very potent message . Its intentions are certainly very honourable , and this will probably remain one of the highlights of director Robert Wise's lengthy career . Rennie plays his role with sincerity and is very believable - even if there's nothing even remotely alien-looking about him . There's also a decent music score by the legendary Bernard Herrmann ( the man who composed that infamous music score for Psycho ) . I think this is one of those films that is very much a product of its era ( this film , and The Thing From Another World , helped to usher in the science-fiction boom of the 1950's ) , but like I ( and many others , I'm sure ) agree , the message is timeless . I give it .
399826	1391795	98068	8.0	A bright and original horror comedy .	Michael Laemle ( Bryan Madorsky ) is an introverted child who's just moved to a new town with his parents . His parents are Nick ( Randy Quaid ) and Lily ( Mary Beth Hurt ) , two conformist types who are always eager to push leftover meat on him . Michael comes to wonder where the meat comes from , noting that all they ever seem to eat is leftovers . The revelation won't come as a surprise at all , but the fun of this movie is getting there . Marking the directorial debut of veteran actor Bob Balaban , it shows very striking visual treatment - there's a fine amount of surreal and disturbing sequences - and maintains a constant true sense of creeping unease throughout . It's as dark as a dark comedy can get , and does a marvelous job of putting a morbid spin on 1950's suburban Americana , and parenting in general as well . It's irreverent and grim and overall a real hoot . Balabans ' direction is great , and the acting is fine from the cast . Quaid is effectively restrained and he and Hurt make a good pair as the dubious parents . Madorsky offers a mature and low-key performance for a child actor , while Juno Mills-Cockell is appealing as his quirky , free-spirited new friend . Sandy Dennis also has a nice role as a concerned if a little kooky social worker . It's a refreshing and entertainingly sinister movie with a nice feel for the dark side that childhood can have . The whole idea of children wondering just how much or how little they know about their parents is explored for maximum shock value here , and the results are pretty effective .
399059	1391795	69897	8.0	Thoroughly entertaining revenge-driven blaxploitation classic .	Pam Grier had the biggest hit of her career with this tough and gritty blaxploitation film . Playing the title role , she shows incredible poise and conviction , in addition to her undeniable sex appeal . Coffy is a nurse seething after her kid sister has become a drug addict . Knowing full well that the cops are on the take , she determines to take out the villains responsible by herself . Right near the beginning , we know we're in for a good time as Coffy blows a hoodlum's head to a bloody pulp with a shotgun , then forces the man's driver to overdose . Coffy proceeds to infiltrate the criminal organization as a prostitute , making the acquaintance of such gentlemen as King George ( Robert DoQui , a . k . a . Sgt . Reed from the " RoboCop " series ) , a smooth pimp / pusher with his own theme song , Vitroni ( Allan Arbus ) , a gangster from Las Vegas , and Omar ( Pam's frequent co-star and Jack Hill favorite Sid Haig ) , a rather amiable thug . " Coffy " offers such standout sequences as a wild cat fight in which women's breasts are continuously and appreciably being exposed ( and in which food also plays an amusing part ) , and King George's punishment by Vitroni's goons when they believe that he has betrayed them . The film delivers good action scenes in addition to some comedy . It gets very visceral and exciting when Coffy makes a daring escape and the pace really picks up ; in short order she's striking right back at the bad guys , leading up to a brutal act of retribution performed on one man's manhood . The music is funky and fun ( " Coffy Baby " is a groovy theme song ) and the film is quite enjoyable . Furthermore , a great assortment of supporting actors add to the enjoyment : Haig as always is a blast to watch , Arbus is very amusing as the sleazy racist gangster , DoQui is solid as King George , and William Elliott and Booker Bradshaw are both good as the very different men after Coffy's affections . Barry Cahill ( as crooked policeman McHenry ) , Lee de Broux ( as Nick ) , Linda Haynes ( as Meg , the prostitute who resents Coffy's presence ) , and stunt coordinator Bob Minor ( as driver Studs ) , Carol Locatell ( as Priscilla , who provides Coffy with some critical information ) , voice over man Ron Gans ( as an unnamed stranger ) , and Lyman Ward ( as an orderly ) comprise an entertaining bunch of actors . It's going to be particularly interesting for horror fans who know Locatell from her role in " Friday the 13th : A New Beginning " to see her here . Coffy is a very engaging character who simply can't be stopped . She always manages to keep her cool and always has something up her sleeve and is good at thinking her way out of a sticky situation . ( It's priceless to see her hiding razor blades in her Afro , for one thing . ) It's easy to see why this has been hailed as a classic film of its genre . It delivers the goods from beginning to end .
398659	1391795	51150	8.0	A thoroughly enjoyable B horror movie .	Reliable small town doctor Paul Beecher ( John Beal ) gets a hold of some experimental regression pills extracted from vampire bats ; mistaking them for his migraine pills , he starts taking them and becomes addicted to taking them . Slowly it dawns on him that it's causing him to mutate into a hideous fiend that preys on both male and female victims at night . I'm always going to be partial to any film featuring Kenneth Tobey or Dabbs Greer , and since this likable little programmer has both of them , that's all the more reason to watch it . They're both solid , and Coleen Gray ( " Kiss of Death " ' 47 , " Red River " , " The Killing " ) is a beautiful and appealing female lead , but Beal does the standout job in a committed and sympathetic performance . The film has one good stalking sequence , and a good murder sequence . It's a compulsively watchable little genre item that is always interesting and reasonably chilling and offers a new twist on the vampire story . Beals ' makeup is rather different ; more to the point , he resembles a werewolf more than a vampire , and the film doesn't play out quite like what we're used to with vampire movies , so I found it quite intriguing . It's entertaining from scene to scene and doesn't waste time - once it's over , it's over . I thought it was a fun little movie , and enjoyed it very much .
398713	1391795	93870	8.0	" Dead or alive , you're coming with me . "	In the ultra-violent Detroit of the near future , nice-guy cop Alex Murphy ( Peter Weller ) is savagely executed by mean , brutal thugs . His body is used then to create a cyborg ( part man , part machine ) that is intended to be the ultimate law enforcement officer . The only problem is , he still retains his human memories and becomes consumed with striking back at the men who killed him . I call this the ultimate in visceral entertainment . Although it's not necessarily a stupid movie , you don't have to think about it , you can just enjoy it . It feels rather cathartic for me to watch such a repellent variety of worthless scum get their just desserts . It's hard-hitting , intense , and incredibly violent . It's also slick , well cast , and well acted . I like it right down to the music score by Basil Poledouris ( I can still hear that theme in my head ) . And veteran effects master Rob Bottin did a great job of supervising the creation and design of RoboCop . The appearance is impressive ( and I'm sure it must have a real pain for star Weller , getting in and out of that costume ) . But don't forget the stop-motion animation contribution by Phil Tippett . ' ED-209 ' is a good creation , too . A must for fans of macho science-fiction / action thrillers .
399130	1391795	80707	8.0	A nicely sleazy and sordid vigilante picture .	A memorably tough , nasty , and supremely gritty NYC vigilante action favorite obviously patterned after " Death Wish " , this flick stars Robert Ginty as John Eastland , Vietnam veteran working with his fellow former soldier Michael Jefferson ( Steve James ) in a market . Michael doesn't last long before he is targeted by gang members who attack him and paralyze him for life . This motivates John to do something about the level of crime in The City . He's not content , however , to stop with the gang members . He wages a full-scale war against the criminal element , while Detective James Dalton ( Christopher George ) is on his trail . This film really wastes no time . It starts with some very well-staged and hellish Vietnam scenes , the highlight of which is a brutal decapitation ( Tom Burman and Stan Winston supply the makeup effects ) . Writer / director James Glickenhaus compensates for a lack of originality by infusing his film with a relentless seediness and memorable set pieces . One of the absolute best moments has a mafioso getting fed into a meat grinder . A creepy sequence has John going after a " chicken pimp " whose primary business is supplying depraved johns with underage boys . But in the tradition of vigilante leads such as Charles Bronson's Paul Kersey in " Death Wish " , John will always turn up to punish criminal scum in the most visceral manner possible . Excellent location shooting ( as well as some great overhead shots of The City ) is a big plus , as well as some effectively melancholy songs on the soundtrack . Ginty is fine in the lead , with the ever engaging George a good choice for the role of the detective ; Samantha Eggar has a relatively minor role as an emerging love interest for George . The always charismatic James is fun to watch in his brief screen time , with some familiar faces such as Tony DiBenedetto , Dennis Boutsikaris , George Cheung , Irwin Keyes , and Tom Everett in bit parts . " The Exterminator " comes as a strong recommendation for fans of exploitation and action .
399813	1391795	87363	8.0	Memorable 1980's product still packs a mean punch .	Traveling inventor and salesman Rand Peltzer ( singer Hoyt Axton ) buys an unusual Christmas present for his bank employee son Billy ( Zach Galligan ) : a strange , never-before-seen animal called a " Mogwai " , whom Rand christens " Gizmo " . There are three extremely important rules to follow in order to take proper care of " Gizmo " : don't expose him to light , don't expose him to water , and above all else , never feed him after midnight . As you might expect , rule two is broken soon enough , and " Gizmo " spawns a quintet of new Mogwai . Then rule three is broken ( unknowingly ) and the new Mogwai metamorphose into little green devils called " Gremlins " that proceed to tear the little town of Kingston Falls apart . After all this time - it's been a while since I saw it - I still get a kick out of it . Equal parts scary and funny , with memorable music score ( and catchy central theme ) by Jerry Goldsmith , and the little monsters are inventively realized by Chris Walas and his effects team . ( The monsters range from being frightening to being absolutely hilarious . ) The main problem for some viewers will undeniably be an approach that can be seen as mean-spirited and ugly . I can understand why some people wouldn't be able to stomach this film , particularly when Kate ( Phoebe Cates ) tells the story of why she doesn't celebrate Christmas . Overall , this nasty horror / comedy emerges as one of my favorite 1980's pictures . This was the first film I saw legendary cult actor Dick Miller ( a favorite of director Joe Dante ) in , and he's remained an entertaining actor to watch . Actors William Schallert and Kenneth Tobey appear uncredited . Howie Mandel is the voice of " Gizmo " , and the ubiquitous Frank Welker is the voice of lead gremlin " Stripe " . Michael Winslow , the vocal sound effects guy from the " Police Academy " movies , was also one of the vocal effects artists here . Some of you might want to keep in mind that the original draft of the screenplay was even darker , with horrible fates intended for Mrs . Peltzer and Barney the dog . Before I go , I want to say that writer turned director Chris Columbus's script does beg questions such as : If the wrong time to feed " Gizmo " is after midnight , when does the right time begin ?
399326	1391795	85333	8.0	" Watch what you call my car . . . she's real sensitive . "	Back in 1983 , Stephen King was such a popular author that this film adaptation went into production before the book was even published . King had been satisfied enough with producer Richard Kobritz's TV miniseries adaptation of his novel " Salem's Lot " to send him a few manuscripts . One was " Cujo " , another was " Christine " . Kobritz decided he liked the latter more , and pursued it as a film project . Accomplished film-maker John Carpenter , who at the time was still suffering the effects of the critical and commercial failure of his previous film , " The Thing " , agreed to take the helm , and Bill Phillips was hired to write the screenplay . Phillips eliminated much of the material of the novel ( especially the central character of the malevolent spirit Roland D . LeBay ) and both he and Carpenter agreed to more or less focus the film on Christine herself . In the film , Christine is possessed with a murderous , vengeful personality , seemingly for no reason at all . She is simply as evil as an inanimate object can get . Before she even comes off the assembly line , she's injured one man and killed another . Eventually , she comes into the life of hopeless high school nerd Arnie Cunningham ( Keith Gordon , in his first top-billed role , and offering a dramatic tour de force ) and helps to transform him from pathetic dweeb to dangerous 1950's style rebel - complete with 1950's style wardrobe . As the car sets about methodically eliminating most of the characters who cause Arnie grief , Arnie's loyal , level-headed jock friend Dennis Guilder ( John Stockwell ) and beautiful , would-be girlfriend Leigh Cabot ( Alexandra Paul ) try their darnedest to save Arnie and get rid of the car once and for all . While I myself found this movie to be rather lacking in terms of scares , suspense , and atmosphere , it's still a pleasantly well-crafted and stylish film . Carpenter contributes another of his marvelous electronic scores , and the film is peppered with vintage rock ' n ' roll songs . Approximately 25 different cars were used for the film - many of them ended up completely destroyed - and the special effects are admirable , especially in all scenes where Christine is repairing herself . One standout scene has Christine pursuing pudgy thug Moochie Welch ( Malcolm Danare ) into an exceptionally narrow loading dock , and then SQUEEZING herself inside so she can annihilate him . The wonderful cast is a heavy asset . Stockwell and Paul were certainly okay , but even better are the familiar faces in the character parts - Roberts Blossom as George LeBay , Robert Prosky as Will Darnell , and Harry Dean Stanton as Detective Rudolph Junkins . Kelly Preston appears in an early role . Bill Ostrander , as lead bully Buddy Repperton , has always struck me as a great casting choice ( Gordon and Carpenter remark in the DVD commentary that he seems to be partly channeling John Travolta in his performance - appropriate , because the film takes place in 1978 , when Travolta was experiencing his original bout of stardom ) , because he looks EXACTLY like I'd always imagined Buddy Repperton would look when I visualized the action while reading the novel . Here's an interesting thing to take note of : the actors playing Arnie's rather unlikable parents are named CHRISTINE Belford and Robert DARNELL . Just coincidence ? I myself don't know . Like I said , I don't really find it to be all that scary but it certainly offers a fair amount of fun . It's not a top-drawer King adaptation but it's definitely not one of the worst ones either .
398978	1391795	100369	8.0	Very entertaining effort from Stuart Gordon .	Set during the Spanish Inquisition , this take on the Poe story features Grand Inquisitor Torquemada ( Lance Henriksen in a marvelously intense performance ) engaging in various acts of torture to get citizens to confess to witchcraft . He targets young baker Antonio ( Jonathan Fuller ) and his wife Maria ( the amazingly alluring Rona De Ricci , who looks great in and out of clothes ) , only to find himself lusting after her . He then proceeds to torture her , concluding that his lust can only be the result of her " bewitching " him . Putting aside anachronisms such as the lack of accents and the rather modern way much of the dialog is delivered , this is a solid effort from veteran genre director Gordon . It looks fantastic , with impressive sets and costumes . In his ever enjoyable fashion , Gordon spices it up with plenty of violence and his great touch for black humor . Granted , the broader comedy relief ( courtesy of Torquemadas ' clownish associates played amusingly by Jeffrey Combs , Stephen Lee , and William J . Norris ) I could have done without , but overall the film is commendably as intense as Henriksens ' central performance . It's very striking , involving ( De Ricci not only is very attractive , she really gets to the heart of her impassioned character ) , and lavish , with a typically fine music score by Richard Band . The strong supporting cast contributes equally vivid turns ; Frances Bay , Tom Towles , Mark Margolis are all excellent as well . Gordons ' actress wife Carolyn turns up , and as usual , there's a graphic demise in store for her . Oliver Reed pops up about halfway through the movie in a nice cameo as a Cardinal . It's a great Full Moon production and a film that any fan of Gordons ' " Re-Animator " or " From Beyond " ought to see .
398844	1391795	45546	8.0	The two Rays have a successful first collaboration .	Based on a Ray Bradbury story published in the Saturday Evening Post , this 1950's atomic age creature feature is about a giant rhedosaurus , freed from an icy tomb in the Arctic by an atomic bomb test ; it swims down the Arctic current and ends up on the rampage in NYC . A good , enjoyable cast , competent direction and script , and Ray Harryhausen's impressive stop-motion animation mingle in this little classic that delivered more for me after a second viewing . I have actually changed my opinion on some of these types of pictures . At first , I was a little impatient with the slowness of some scenes and the heavy emphasis on dialog , but now I'm better able to appreciate this film as well as " It Came From Beneath the Sea " , Harryhausen's giant-octopus-on-the-loose thriller . If I were rating ICFBtS today , I would give it . For low-budget pictures such as this , they actually deliver a fair amount of spectacle . So far I haven't seen many of the films that Harryhausen worked on ( 16 in total ) , but I'll get around to the rest of them sooner or later . Squinty-eyed Western veteran Lee Van Cleef is the soldier at the climax who fires the shot that kills the beast . James " Roscoe P . Coltrane " Best also has a tiny role .
398830	1391795	452781	8.0	Effective documentary about the making of " Freaks " .	Now regarded as a classic after many years of being reviled , Tod Brownings ' " Freaks " is given good documentary treatment . Film historian and author David Skal , who really knows his stuff about the horror films of the era , is just one of several amiable and informative interviewees . Real-life sideshow performers Johnny Meah , Todd Robbins , and Jennifer Miller ( Ms . Miller being a real-life bearded lady ) offer their own thoughts on their business , and Meah and Robbins provide their own compelling insight to and knowledge of the film . Running just a little longer than the actual film , this documentary covers the appropriate bases such as the genesis of the project , the casting , the production , the aftermath of the films ' release , and its subsequent re-discovery . Meah and midget actor Jerry Maren also talk about actually meeting and working with some of the films ' cast . In a nice touch , many of the freaks cast in the film get a brief summary of their lives and careers . Although the film and subject are worthy of even more discussion than what the documentary provides , there's still enough good information to go around here . It moves along quite well and is never less than absorbing . It's a good primer on the subject of sideshow attractions and a good companion piece to the film . It's definitely worth watching for fans .
398872	1391795	85407	8.0	Rock-Solid Stephen King Adaptation .	After a catastrophic car accident , schoolteacher Johnny Smith ( Christopher Walken ) spends five years in a coma . When he wakes up , he soon discovers he has acquired the ability to predict future events . This new ability provides him with a scary revelation involving loud , aggressive senatorial candidate Greg Stillson ( Martin Sheen ) . The second of three Stephen King adaptations that were released in 1983 ( the first was " Cujo " ; the third was " Christine " ) . This is an emotionally involving , intense , and gripping combination of drama and thriller . Well directed by David Cronenberg , and well acted by the cast ( it is Walken's believable performance in the lead that is the best of all ) . I would assess it as having no major flaws . There is a key suicide that is more graphically bloody than the one in the novel , but that's a minor complaint . Overall , the movie is made with conviction and respect for the source material ( always an important factor ) . It emerges as one of the better Stephen King adaptations . Followed by a cable-TV series two decades later , starring Anthony Michael Hall . I am curious to know if this series is any good .
399039	1391795	456398	8.0	Good companion piece to the film " The Entity " .	In this interview / featurette on the Anchor Bay DVD of the 1981 film " The Entity " , real-life parapsychologist Dr . Barry Taff discusses the real-life case that inspired a novel and the subsequent film adaptation . Taff is an engaging subject with plenty of interesting things to say . He talks about his history , and how his own psychic experiences led him to enter the field of parapsychology in university . Other topics include the following of the principle of " Occam's Razor " , which means that " all things being equal , the simplest explanation tends to be the correct one " , and that when he and his colleagues investigate an occurrence , they work through possible rational explanations first . He mentions working with Dr . Thelma Moss and Dr . Kerry Gaynor ; the three of them inspired characters in the film respectively played by Richard Brestoff , Jacqueline Brookes , and Raymond Singer . The majority of his cases ( thousands of them ! ) ultimately wouldn't amount to anything , but there was a small minority of occurrences where things happened that couldn't be easily explained away . The real-life " Entity " story involved a mother of four named Doris Byther , living in a very run-down house and a heavy drinker . However , consumption of alcohol couldn't adequately explain the phenomena that as many as 25 people were witness to . Taff brings up the fact that balls of light even appeared to take on the form of the head and upper torso of a very large man at one point . Supposedly poltergeist-related activity involved objects moving of their own volition . Taff and his colleagues ultimately lost contact with Byther but the case has still gone on record as one of the most memorable cases that they ever worked on . This makes for fascinating viewing for anyone with an open mind .
398596	1391795	71535	8.0	Enjoyable creature feature with a heavy touch of mysticism .	A savage , lizard-like beast that is tearing the hearts out of its victims is terrorizing a village . The staff at a nearby girls ' school hire hunky hunter Sigurd ( Tony Kendall ) to both guard them and kill the beast . While Sigurd finds himself attracted to the strict and aloof Elke ( Silvia Tortosa ) , he is also drawn to the mysterious beauty ( Helga Line , looking incredibly ravishing ) frequenting the area . Drawing inspiration from a real-life legend , director Amando de Ossorio ( also well known for the " Blind Dead " series ) knows how to keep this film entertaining and visually arresting . While never truly scary , it does have a haunting , fairly atmospheric quality , and does have a little bit of suspense to it . However , what some people may enjoy most about this likable little Euro exploitation horror flick is its non-stop bevy of scantily clad and delectable ladies and some very , very graphic gore . Anton Garcia Abrils ' music is lovely and ethereal at some times , and at others funky , jazzy , and upbeat , striking an unusual but interesting balance . Miguel Fernandez Milas ' cinematography is also quite impressive . The underwater lair is a nice bit of art direction . The monster itself is a fairly cheesy but undeniably ugly man-in-costume creation , but it never detracts too much from the overall appeal of the film , which has a very affecting , poetic sort of ending that I myself appreciated . It's an entertaining fright flick with enough going for it for me to give it a hearty recommendation .
398664	1391795	86984	8.0	Another solid thriller from Brian De Palma .	Craig Wasson plays Jake Scully , a hapless struggling actor needing a place to stay . New acquaintance Sam Bouchard ( Gregg Henry ) sets him up with an amazing house-sitting gig , the primary attraction of which is the ability to peep on a sexy neighbor , Gloria Revelle ( Deborah Shelton ) , who performs a nightly routine in front of her window . As Jake continues to leer night after night , he ultimately witnesses Gloria being murdered , and decides to investigate the matter on his own . Brian De Palma strikes again with a typically stylish murder mystery / thriller , with a healthy nod to Hitchcock's " Vertigo " and " Rear Window " . It's an enjoyable exercise in pure sleaze , with plenty of sordid details . The plot also involves the hardcore porn genre , with Jake determined to interrogate one of its stars , Holly Body ( an appealing Melanie Griffith ) , whom Jake figures out was involved . The film uses the whole idea of the " body double " concept to craft a twist-laden story about illusion and deception , with apt commentary on the human capacity for voyeurism . It does an amusing and respectful job of paying tribute to both B level horror flicks ( Jake is starring in a tacky flick titled " Vampire's Kiss " ) and the porn industry . And it's a riveting bit of entertainment as well ( one whole sequence , featuring Frankie Goes to Hollywood's hit song " Relax " , is akin to a music video ) as well . De Palma gets great use out of his L . A . locations , and injects his film with a healthy dose of humor as well . Especially effective is the typically haunting music score by Pino Donaggio . The likable Wasson , the enjoyably smarmy Henry , and the enticing Griffith are well supported by Shelton as the sexy yet unhappy Gloria , Guy Boyd in a scene-stealing turn as the detective on the case , and Dennis Franz as a director he modeled after De Palma himself . Turning up in small parts are Barbara Crampton ( " Re-Animator " ) , Brinke Stevens , and Slavitza Jovan ( Gozer in " Ghost Busters " ) . " Body Double " is a good deal of sleazy and tongue-in-cheek fun .
398849	1391795	51554	8.0	I like it ! Cushing and Lee at their finest .	Jonathan Harker ( John Van Eyssen ) goes to Count Dracula's ( Christopher Lee ) castle under the guise of being his librarian , but is really there to destroy the Count . When he becomes a victim , his smooth and efficient colleague Dr . Van Helsing ( Peter Cushing ) arrives on the scene and proceeds to go after the blood-sucker himself . Good-looking ( with nice sets and nice photography ) , this in-color adaptation of Bram Stoker's legendary novel tells the story somewhat differently , but it is entertaining . It's one of those horror films that , while failing to really scare me , is a fine piece of work nonetheless . Cushing and Lee excel as the two adversaries . I don't think that there's much I can say about this except that it's a great choice for fans of the Gothic horror that Britain's Hammer Studios served up for many years . I would recommend that you see it sometime .
399743	1391795	163651	8.0	It's not what it looks like , Dad !	Some folks might consider this " Porky's " for the nineties : four teen-aged guys , who seem to think about little else besides sex , make a pact to lose their virginity on prom night . While the main drawing card of this movie seems to be the assortment of raunchy gags ( and I'll admit they do make me laugh ) what really helps it is the likability and earnestness of the cast . You can't help but sympathize ( maybe even identify ) with these people . Plus , you can't go wrong with casting funny man Eugene Levy as Jim's dad ; the old man teaches Jim about masturbation and skin mags and these scenes are priceless . I'll say it : I like this movie , I'm not ashamed to say it , and I don't consider myself a moron for enjoying it . Interesting aside , though : I read that Spike Lee was so disgusted by this film that it motivated him to make his film " The Original Kings of Comedy " . To each his own , I say , and I give it .
399249	1391795	113858	8.0	Pretty good as B movies go .	The crashing of an alien spaceship in a forest results in enormous mosquitoes after the tiny blood suckers feast on the alien corpses . After the deadly creatures lay waste to a multitude of locals , a disparate group of survivors hooks up , realizing that they will have to take care of the problem themselves . Director Gary Jones and crew aren't exactly out to re-invent the wheel here . They're just delivering a humorous and low , low budget 90's spin on the giant insect classics of the 50's , and clearly having fun doing it . It delivers some welcome in-jokes , with the most noteworthy coming as Gunnar Hansen - none other than Leatherface of " Texas Chain Saw Massacre " fame - hefts a chain saw and proclaims " I haven't held one of these for 20 years . Feels good . " There are even shades of " Night of the Living Dead " and " Alien " , which made it especially fun for a genre fan like me . The pacing was very effective ; the movie does not waste time and keeps the tension going once it kicks into gear . The attack scenes are particularly , enjoyably brutal , as the mosquitoes jab their proboscis into eyeballs and posteriors . The special effects are agreeable enough - both the mosquitoes themselves and their desiccated victims . The engaging no-name cast fills out their roles well , and the movie in general is straightforward , unpretentious genre fare made with a certain amount of zeal . I had a good time watching it .
399122	1391795	69278	8.0	A good entry in the " disaster movie " genre .	The ever authoritative Charlton Heston is Henry O'Hara , pilot of a commercial airliner , who receives an unwelcome surprise on his latest flight . One of the passengers is demanding that their destination be rerouted from Minneapolis-St . Paul to Anchorage . It turns out to be Vietnam vet Jerome Weber ( James Brolin ) , who grows more and more unstable as the flight goes on . Released during the early years of the " disaster movie " boom of the 1970's , " Skyjacked " is based on a novel by David Harper . It's very watchable throughout , with director John Guillermin ( who went on to do " The Towering Inferno " with Irwin Allen ) creating a good amount of ever-increasing tension . Especially effective is the sequence where Heston is guided through a heavy storm by Claude Akins . Even if melodramatic at times , it always does a good job of getting right back to the business at hand . The cast plays the material for all it's worth . The expectantly broad range of characters includes a middle-aged couple ( gorgeous flame-haired Jeanne Crain and Ross Elliott ) , a sexy young hippie chick ( the appealing Susan Dey ) , a senator ( Walter Pidgeon ) and his son ( Nicholas Hammond ) , a genial cellist ( the engaging Roosevelt Grier ) , a pregnant young woman ( a lovely Mariette Hartley ) , and the stewardesses ( including Yvette Mimieux and Leslie Uggams ) and co-pilot Mike Henry . This solid ensemble helps to give the film a certain credibility . Although the mood does get very intense at times , a key to its effectiveness is that even though the threat that Brolin presents is very real , he's not entirely unsympathetic . And Heston anchors the whole thing very well with his cool , no-nonsense demeanor . O'Hara is the kind of low-key hero whose reliability is evident right from the start . Personally , I thought it was enjoyably sincere stuff , with just the right amount of suspense and excitement to keep it entertaining .
399248	1391795	49646	8.0	Good fun .	The introduction of Nigel Kneales ' Prof . Quatermass character to the screen results in this well done sci-fi / horror entry in which a spaceship returns to Earth with only one survivor out of three astronauts . Victor Carroon ( Richard Wordsworth ) , the only one left , is clearly not all right , however . Infested by an alien being , he's slowly mutating into a monster with quick reproductive capabilities . Prof . Quatermass ( Brian Donlevy ) must work with the London police to track him down when he escapes . It's very well directed by Val Guest , the man behind other genre fare such as " The Abominable Snowman " and " The Day the Earth Caught Fire " . It's rather imaginative in terms of its alien menace , and is full of tension . It hits the ground running and unfolds at a consistent pace , and maintains a genuinely creepy feeling , helped in no small part by the incredible performance of Wordsworth . The makeup effects are effective as well . A smart , efficient script and solid performances are major assets . Donlevy and Jack Warner work well together as the heroes with differing viewpoints and ways of doing things . David King-Wood and Harold Lang are excellent in supporting roles and Thora Hird has a comedic , scene-stealing role late in the picture . Both intelligent and fun at the same time , " The Quatermass Xperiment " emerges as a superb entry in the sci-fi / horror boom of the 1950's . It would lead to further cinematic Quatermass adventures that are also well worth checking out .
399045	1391795	458480	8.0	Simon says " Hope you enjoy this good blast of dumb , gory fun " .	We're back in traditional slasher territory for this one , folks : a group of attractive and obnoxious kids go for a camping trip , only to be victimized by Simon ( Crispin Glover , a true hammy delight ) . Writer / director William Dear ( the man behind such movies as " Harry and the Hendersons " ! ) makes this a very silly and over-the-top affair . Don't watch this for anything resembling scares or suspense . It's an irreverent movie fulfilling some requirements of the genre - gore and T & A ( although the T & A quotient is actually much too low ) . Yet , at the same time , it plays with the conventions of the genre as well . I won't deny that it's stupid , but it's a fun kind of stupid and hard to resist . The prospect of watching the almighty and refreshingly offbeat actor Glover playing a slasher villain is one good gimmick to draw someone in , but this is also noteworthy for being a true family affair . The producer is veteran actor Ernie Lively , who managed to get three of his acting offspring into the movie : Lori , Blake , and Robyn . Son Jason ( of " Night of the Creeps " fame ) is unfortunately not to be seen , however . Even the directors ' son , Oliver , gets into the act , by playing the hapless hitch-hiker , and also serving as production designer , second unit director , special effects artist , and storyboard artist ! One has to admire Simons ' ingenuity . It's obvious that he fills his ample spare time making weapons , and what vicious weapons they are . They seem to be able to cover the entire forest . ( While the movie comes up short in terms of nudity , the plentiful gore may keep some viewers interested . ) This is additionally an interesting throwback to the politically incorrect days of the slasher genre . It will definitely shock and either delight or disgust you depending on your sensibilities . I can understand why some people wouldn't like it , but I had a high old time watching this ridiculous and shameless no-brainer . It's a positively infectious dose of nonsense .
399018	1391795	48696	8.0	One of the great " giant bug " movies of the 1950's .	Scientist Gerald Deemer ( Leo G . Carroll ) has developed a formula that he hopes will solve the problem of a growing world population with not enough food to feed them all . The formula causes animals to grow at an accelerated rate , and wouldn't you know it , a giant tarantula escapes and scours the Southwestern desert , devouring some hapless victims and terrorizing all . I enjoyed this movie because it remains convincing instead of descending into laugh-ability as I'm sure some of the other " giant bug " movies of the period did . The special effects actually work , and the film is refreshingly serious when it could have turned into blatant camp . I thought it was genuinely chilling , with likable characters and good pacing . John Agar is an engaging hero , and Mara Corday fits the mold of other female leads from the period - brainy instead of being merely decorative . The added subplot that shows what the formula does to human beings is a decent bonus - the makeup effects turn out to be pretty good , especially as they relate to the character of Deemer . A certain gravely-voiced film legend , in one of his earliest feature film appearances , can be seen right at the end of the film , as the jet squadron leader . A good effort by all concerned ; an uncredited Henry Mancini was one of the composers of the effective music score .
399143	1391795	74954	8.0	Exploitation with heart .	Sweet-as-could-be Southern girl Jamie Barker ( lovely and adorable Monica Gayle ) wants very much to be a country and western star . Of course , anything would be preferable to being physically reprimanded by her father for listening to country music in church , or being the object of lust for horny young males . Unfortunately , she finds sex to be a recurring theme in her quest for the big time : she runs into one big male jerk after another , the kind of men who talk big but who , more often than not , seem to only want to get in her pants . Her friendship with session musician Kelly ( Roger Davis ) finally opens a door when he introduces her to a big shot in the business , Jeb ( Glenn Corbett ) . New World sure delivers the exploitative goodies ; their track record is as good as gold in this department . The picture delivers eye-catching dollops of female nudity , and men force themselves on poor Jamie on more than one occasion . ( Even a lesbian guard gets in on the action ! ) In essence , this is , however , part of what really drives the movie : the loss of innocence , and the often depressing pitfalls on the way to making a name for oneself . It's exploitative , sure , but it's also effectively dramatic . It's heartbreaking to see this naive , trusting girl become so cynical , but also heartening to see her ultimately stand up for herself and proclaim her independence . All of this is underscored by some mighty fine country music ( with real-life singer Johnny Rodriguez doing a brief cameo as himself ) . Gayle does a superb job in the title role ; she's an absolute delight . The other cast members each play their roles very well , from the likable Davis as the friend , the all-too-believable Corbett as a selfish control freak with a yen for young women , the feisty Marcie Barkin and engaging Shirley Jo Finney as the girlfriends , the late screen veteran Jesse White as a slippery music publisher , and Roger Corman regular Leo Gordon as a truck driver . This little picture is satisfying in a number of ways , being humorous , poignant , and nicely sleazy & sordid all at the same time . It's quite simply a fine example of the exploitation boom of the 1970's .
398974	1391795	96379	8.0	Enjoyable B comedy .	" Police Academy " inspired movie that kick started a series ( six in total ) ; a mostly female class of vice squad hopefuls go through training . The three leads are ever delightful Linnea Quigley , sexy Karen Russell , and affable Ken Abraham as pals who need to fill a quota of arrests before graduation . Before the movie is over , they'll take on both porno movie makers and a bevy of hookers . This cheerfully silly movie is hard to resist . Writer - producer - director - editor Rick Sloane keeps it so upbeat that I can forgive just how silly it is . It delivers some good laughs and a fine assortment of attractive female cast members ( Quigley and Russell also bare their breasts as a good bonus ) . Everyone looks like they're having a good time , which definitely helps . Ginger Lynn Allen provides a good foil for Quigley as her snooty competitor ( the daughter of the police chief ) , with standout supporting turns by Jayne Hamil as the demanding instructor Miss Devonshire , a campy Jeannie Carol as the villainous Queen Bee , and Stephanie Bishop as porno director Desiree . They're each quite amusing in their own way . Overall , it's an agreeable lowbrow comedy that I had a pretty good time watching .
399270	1391795	84854	8.0	Very entertaining thriller with top-notch cast .	A hostage situation in a London townhouse is made all the worse by an unexpected element : a deadly Black Mamba , a snake with particularly lethal venom . The snake was sent to the wrong customer , wouldn't you know it , and now it has the run of the place . Brought in to replace original director Tobe Hooper ( supposedly a casualty of the ever-popular excuse " creative differences " ) , Piers Haggard stepped in and did an admirable job . The snake doesn't actually play as big a part in the proceedings as one might think ; it's simply another wrinkle in the plan of the hostage takers . The movie is full of sharp , unrelenting tension ; it starts slowly as it sets up all of the plot developments , and then unfolds at a nerve-wracking pace . The cast is far and away the best component : an international collection of professionals including a typically intense and squirrelly Klaus Kinski , an edgy Oliver Reed , a high-strung Susan George , and a tired-looking but very solid Sterling Hayden brings life to the proceedings . It's just as interesting to watch the interplay between Kinski and Reed ( apparently , they could not get on in real life as well ) in addition to the other major players . Sarah Miles , Nicol Williamson , Cornelia Sharpe , Lance Holcomb , and Michael Gough all do a good job as well . David Ball , a real life London zoo keeper brought on board for technical advice , is actually played in the film by Gough . Excellent music by Michael Kamen and polished cinematography by ace veteran Gilbert Taylor are major assets ; the snakes ' point of view camera work works well and is a nice touch . Everybody involved combines their talents to craft a riveting movie that might have descended into silly schlock in less professional hands . The London setting was a nice locale , and the film is never at any time boring . It's fun from beginning to end .
398891	1391795	35937	8.0	Richard Dix is excellent in this Val Lewton production .	This film in the Lewton canon doesn't really qualify as horror , but it's still quite moody and atmospheric . Dix plays Will Stone , captain of a ship named the Altair . His new Third Officer is a young man named Tom Merriam ( Russell Wade ) . Stone is established as a lonely man with not much to live for but a belief in " authority " that he espouses at every turn . When Tom begins to suspect that Will will do anything to get his point across - including murdering his own men - he has a tough time convincing other people that the captain's motives aren't pure . " The Ghost Ship " is an effective psychological drama that gives its star a chance to subtly delineate a man slowly going over the edge . As I've said , it does exhibit the qualities of Lewton's best work by creating an eerie mood and atmosphere . As the plot unfolds , it's easy to sympathize with Tom and hope that Will can be exposed . Will still has the support of his crew and agent and Tom is at the disadvantage for not having solid enough evidence . The main cast all does creditable work ; Edith Barrett , Ben Bard and Edmund Glover are fine in support . Also noteworthy is the sharp-featured Skelton Knaggs as the mute Finn , a character seemingly taken for granted but far more observant and intelligent than others give him credit for . And it's cool to see Lawrence Tierney , still a few years away from his breakout role as the title character in " Dillinger " , as the ill-fated Louie Parker . " The Ghost Ship " is over pretty quickly ( running only an hour and ten minutes ) , with a resolution that does feel a little abrupt , but the film is still effectively creepy and enticing , with a straightforward story and a palpable sense of menace .
399189	1391795	62235	8.0	This playfully macabre movie is a real hoot .	In this combination of old-time movie serial and Gothic horror , inspired by Poes ' " Pit and the Pendulum " , evil Count Regula ( Christopher Lee , wonderful as always ) is drawn and quartered after having murdered a dozen virgins . 35 years later , two acquaintances , Roger Mont Elise ( former Tarzan performer Lex Barker , stoic and rugged but pretty darn stiff ) and Baroness Lilian von Brabant ( ravishing Karin Dor ) are invited to the castle where Regula performed his nefarious deeds . It seems that the Count has been consumed with the idea of vengeance all of this time and has figured how to cheat death . . . and he's out to punish Roger and Lilian mightily . This is a delightfully flamboyant horror movie that works because it has a not-too-serious approach that is quite amusing ( this whole idea was reinforced for me by the music , decidedly silly at times ) . It's lively , with director Harald Reinl maintaining a consistent pace and flair and delivering a solid climax full of tense moments . It's also pretty humorous : Vladimir Medar is the broad comedy relief as Pater Fabian , although Carl Lange does even better as henchman Anathol , stealing every scene that he's in . Atmosphere is also quite respectable ; no assessment of this picture would be complete without praise for the marvelous art direction-set decoration & cinematography and use of locations ; there's a real period feel at all times . The use of color is just great and the Hieronymous Bosch paintings are impressively twisted . All in all , the whole movie is a real visual treat . Entertaining from beginning to end , this is something I wouldn't hesitate to recommend to horror buffs everywhere .
398985	1391795	120082	9.0	Even better the second time around .	Sidney Prescott ( Neve Campbell ) is a university student a few years after the events of the original movie . As could be expected , a movie titled " Stab " , based on the events of the original film , is being released . Also , as could be expected , a copycat killer is on the loose , savagely killing everybody in sight , intent on creating a " real-life " sequel of sorts . I like " Scream 2 " even better than the first movie . I think it gave me even more for my money . More killings , more bloodshed . . . and more chase / suspense scenes . It goes on pretty long for a horror / thriller ( those kinds of films generally aren't much longer than an hour and a half , while this one runs about two hours long ) but it provides good entertainment throughout . The gimmick is that now the film-makers are attempting to poke fun at horror movie sequels , where the rules tend to change a little bit . Best of all , the movie has one smart African-American character who's actually smarter than most of the panic-stricken white folk in the film . You don't see that too often in horror movies . And one spectacular death scene for one extremely unfortunate police detective . OUCH ! Some folks may think that this is formula-driven stuff itself that has already become derivative . But at least for me , it's still exciting to watch . ; sometimes sequels really do deliver the goods .
399118	1391795	96754	9.0	This top-notch underwater saga is one of my favorite films .	Epic-scale , intensely emotional science-fiction / drama / thriller in which an underwater drilling crew , led by Virgil " Bud " Brigman ( Ed Harris ) is recruited by the Navy to assist in a dangerous rescue mission . Eventually they all discover they are not alone deep down there in the water . . . I love this movie , what more can I say ? Many underwater movies have got nothing on it . The only problem is the running time : 145 minutes , extended to 171 minutes for the special edition . Some people may therefore have a hard time sticking with it , especially those who can't stand material that they deem " sappy " . It is in any event an impressive , major undertaking for writer / director James Cameron that provides acting showcases not just for the leads ( Harris , Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio , Michael Biehn ) but a fine supporting cast filled with good character actors . I think it is a very slick , professionally handled movie with stunning special effects that had to have been state-of-the-art at the time . The drama is compelling ( there is no shortage of crises to overcome ) and the dialog is often good . I sure have to admire Cameron for having a successful track record . All of his movies have been good ( not to mention big money-makers ) , with the possible exception of his directing debut " Piranha Part II : The Spawning " , which I still haven't seen . And once again , an excellent score by Alan Silvestri .
399047	1391795	200546	10.0	An absolutely fine and worthy horror film .	This 44 minute long movie is a respectful and remarkable H . P . Lovecraft adaptation . It centers on a Dr . Munoz ( veteran actor Jack Donner , in a tour-de-force performance ) , who is befriended by struggling writer Randolph Carter ( played by director Bryan Moore ) . Munoz , a gentle and wise type , has a tragedy in his past weighing heavily on his present and also a terminal affliction kept secret until the shattering conclusion . Moore went through a major struggle of his own getting his film made ( in time for an H . P . Lovecraft festival held in Portland ) but the end result is worth it . It's well realized on film : it's a somber and heartfelt tale and a worthwhile meditation on the human will to live . Its faithfulness to its source material is also well worth noting . Shot in grainy black and white ( which does suit the material ) and enhanced by excellent music , it's riveting throughout . It's also effectively restrained ; Lovecraft left the visuals to our imagination and the film-makers largely do the same here . I give this my strongest recommendation .
398784	1391795	72251	10.0	A winner of a movie , in every way .	Excellent thriller from 1974 about an incredibly prepared quartet of criminals , led by ' Mr . Blue ' ( Robert Shaw ) , who hijack a subway train and hold its conductor and 17 passengers hostage for $1 million in ransom money - to be delivered in just one hour . A phenomenal cast delivers the goods in a witty , clever , and thoroughly pumped up movie that never lets up . The pace is consistently intense , and the action is often loud and furious . Walter Matthau , as the heroic Lt . Garber , and Shaw as Blue , make for a classy and compulsively watchable pair of adversaries . Shaw's Mr . Blue is the kind of movie villain who always seems to have the upper hand , having thought everything out so well beforehand , and he's also the kind of guy who never is seen to lose his cool . Mr . Green's cohorts are played by the superb veterans Martin Balsam ( the ill-fated private detective from the original " Psycho " ) and Hector Elizondo . Earl Hindman , who would 17 years later catch my attention as the quirky yet wise neighbor Wilson on ' Home Improvement ' , is the fourth and youngest member of the team . An absolutely incredible lineup of familiar faces fills out the other roles : James Broderick ( Matthew's father ) as the motorman Doyle , Dick O'Neill as the hostile Frank Correll , as well as Jerry Stiller , Doris Roberts , Julius Harris , Tony Roberts , Lee Wallace , and Kenneth McMillan . In the tradition of other 1970's classics like " Serpico " and " Taxi Driver " , the movie captures the ambiance of 1970's era NYC very well . You just can't beat authentic location filming for this kind of story . Highlighted by an especially amusing ending , which ultimately pays off a running gag , present throughout , regarding one of the crooks . Exciting and well-made ; one of the high points of veteran director Joseph Sargent's career . Followed by a made-for-TV remake 24 years later .
399544	1391795	83739	10.0	A wonderfully visceral and gripping cult flick .	" Class of 1984 " is a highly memorable melodrama depicting a high school of the " future " overridden by violence and crime . Sadly , this premise , while far-out at the time , turned out to be all too prophetic . Perry King plays Andy Norris , the new music teacher at this high school . He's replacing a man named Goldstein who supposedly had an " accident " . Almost immediately , Andy is butting heads with the kingpin of this school , a snot-nosed and deranged under-age creep named Peter Stegman ( Timothy Van Patten ) . Andy refuses to be bullied by the young psychopath , and their war of wills reaches an inevitable breaking point when Stegman and his gang target Andy's pregnant wife ( Merrie Lynn Ross ) . Van Patten creates a very vivid villain who I had a lot of fun hating , but the real star of this movie is , for me , veteran Roddy McDowall . The " Planet of the Apes " series star is biology teacher Terry Corrigan , an embittered alcoholic despondent over the fact that he can't get his students to want to learn anything , and who is clearly just one step from a nervous breakdown . His highlight scene is the said breakdown , where he forces his students to answer biology questions at gunpoint . Canadian legend Al Waxman pops in from time to time as the detective who is basically powerless to appropriately punish these young miscreants . And Michael J . Fox ( billed here without the middle initial ) makes an early screen appearance as a dorky little wise-guy . Yes , this film is undeniably lurid and perverse trash . But it WORKS . The struggle between Andy and Stegman is too compelling to ignore , and the ultra-violent final battle had me on the edge of my seat , cheering on Andy as he handles things the Charles Bronson way . Co-star Ross has little to do . Essentially , she seems to function more as a plot device than as a character - as in the plot device that will conclusively drive Andy over the edge . The film is co-written with future film director Tom Holland , and features a song contribution by Alice Cooper ( " I Am The Future " ) . " Class of 1984 " is a great dose of 1980's trash with a nice side dish of social comment ; it's one of the finest films of its kind that I've ever seen . Note that if you check out the external reviews link , even Roger Ebert had to admit that he enjoyed it ! I certainly give it a hearty endorsement myself .
399152	1391795	55018	10.0	Superb period chiller .	Based on the novel " The Turn of the Screw " by Henry James ( and adapted for the screen by William Archibald and Truman Capote ) , " The Innocents " tells the story of Miss Giddens ( Deborah Kerr ) , the new governess at a country mansion , there to look after orphaned children Miles ( Martin Stephens ) and Flora ( Pamela Franklin ) . As Miss Giddens begins seeing mysterious apparitions , and puzzles over the increasingly bizarre behavior of the children , she tries to piece together this mystery while making sure that no harm comes to her young charges . An excellent example of a bygone era of film-making when terror could be derived from suggestion rather than anything implicit , " The Innocents " is a powerfully stark and forbidding movie . Director Jack Clayton and cinematographer Freddie Francis capture some great images on screen that go well with the ominous mood of the story . It might not appeal to some viewers with its steady and methodical pace , but it still has the ability to maintain a constant sense of unease and trepidation at what secrets may be revealed . Kerr sells it as well as anything else in the film . She delivers a wholly believable performance as a concerned and caring individual struggling to come to grips with inexplicable events , and definitely , successfully conveys a strong feeling of fear . Megs Jenkins is solid in support as the cagey housekeeper Ms . Grose , with Franklin and Stephens doing highly creditable work ( particularly for child actors ) as children who may not be as " innocent " as they certainly appear . There's also a very enjoyable cameo by Michael Redgrave at the outset as the uncle who freely admits to being too selfish to fulfill any sort of familial duties . Georges Aurics ' eerie music is used sparingly ; the soundtrack works just as well without music in creating tension . The house and countryside also convey a strong sense of keeping some sort of secret hidden . An emotionally effective character study as well as interesting psychological horror , " The Innocents " creeps along towards a memorable ending . It's the kind of film that gets under the skin and stays there .
399527	1391795	98415	10.0	An exciting and involving thriller from Don Coscarelli .	Sandwiched among his " Phantasm " series as well as " The Beastmaster " , Don Coscarelli crafted this nice little surprise that's worthy of either discovery or re-discovery . Six disparate people , either trying to better themselves or prove something to themselves , have signed up for a wilderness survival course taught by Hank ( Lance Henriksen , in a truly wonderful performance ) . At the same time , however , a different sort of survival school - leaning in a more militant direction - is underway , taught by gung-ho Jake ( Henriksens ' " Aliens " co-star Mark Rolston , well cast in his role and convincing ) . As Hanks ' students , including well-off bride-to-be Olivia ( Traci Lin ) , macho Jeff ( Dominic Hoffman ) , middle-aged Hal ( Ben Hammer ) , divorcée Cheryl ( Catherine Keener ) , comic relief Joey ( comedian Paul Provenza ) , and convict Gray ( Dermot Mulroney ) , trudge through the forest , they learn to rely on and respect one another , as they also learn to face and conquer their fears . Ultimately , the students in the other class take things too far and Hanks ' students have to face the most harrowing challenge of all . This is a stirring , involving , and exciting movie with characters one can actually like and root for . The actors are all believable and deliver very engaging performances . ( Even the antagonists in this movie are not merely one-dimensional , which I appreciated . ) The movie is well directed and has some fine sequences ; the scenes on the river are particularly well done . The scenery is beautiful and photographed very well , and the music by Fred Myrow and Christopher L . Stone is very effective . The movie takes time building but at no time is it ever less than interesting . I liked it a lot and I would definitely recommend it to others .
398936	1391795	115641	10.0	" Huh , huh , huh , you said ' butt ' . . . "	Feature-length expansion of the popular 1990's animated MTV series . Beavis and Butt-head ( both voiced by series creator Mike Judge ) are two intelligence-impaired , hormone-crazed teenagers who embark on a cross-country trek after their beloved television set is stolen . They end up being hired by grubby criminal Muddy ( voice of Bruce Willis ) , who wants them to " do " his wife Dallas ( voice of Demi Moore ) . They accept , after misinterpreting the word " do " . This is a fine viewing experience for anybody who is already a B & B fan ( like me ) . Lots of laughs throughout , with inspired casting of legendary television lawman Robert Stack as ' Agent Flemming ' , who is determined to catch Beavis and Butt-head , thinking they are notorious criminals ( and who is also obsessed with body cavity searches ) . I love it , and I give it .
399461	1391795	44954	10.0	A very enjoyable film noir gem .	Gravel-voiced tough guy Charles McGraw plays Det . Sgt . Walter Brown , assigned to escort a gangsters ' widow , Mrs . Neall ( the striking Marie Windsor ) on a train ride to the trial in which she will testify against a crime ring . They don't even get to the train before hit men start stalking them . The train ride itself proves to be very eventful as Brown has to keep dodging the killers . The picture gets off to a truly great start indicative of the noir style , with very stylish and sinister use of shadow . It's therefore too bad that the rest of the picture is rather brightly lit , but the picture still succeeds admirably due to snappy dialog , bright repartee , and a full-steam-ahead pace . The movie clocks in at a tight and breezy running time of 72 minutes ; there's no filler and the tension is undeniable . The train makes for a nicely claustrophobic setting . McGraw makes for a great " hard boiled " and edgy hero , and it's hard to take ones ' eyes off the gorgeous Windsor . Fine support is provided by David Clarke , Gordon Gebert , Jacqueline White , Queenie Leonard , Peter Virgo , Don Beddoe , Paul Maxey , and Peter Brocco . Attention-getting and riveting from the start , this little movie is quite simply a great deal of fun .
