398698	1391795	118708	1.0	Beverly Hills Nincompoop Is More Like It .	Haru ( Chris Farley ) is a white guy who washed up on the shores of Japan as a baby and is trained to be a ninja by the locals . As could be expected , he grows up to be an incompetent , clumsy bumbler . That doesn't stop him , however , from accepting an offer from California girl Allison ( Nicollette Sheridan ) to spy on her slimy English boyfriend ( Nathaniel Parker ) . I'm sorry , folks , but this is just plain AWFUL . I didn't like ANYTHING about this movie . It's full of standard Chris Farley comedy - tripping , crashing , breaking , flailing - all to no effect . Much of the cast doesn't look happy to be in the movie - and Chris Rock , funny guy that he is , is saddled with a STUPID role . Then again , I suppose if you do have an appreciation for what Farley does , you may be satisfied . Remember , this is just my opinion . ! ( My lowest rating ever since I started doing this ! )
398637	1391795	110189	2.0	Unless you're a fan of these guys , DON'T WATCH .	Real-life comics Johnny Brennan and Kamal ( Ahmed ) , basically playing themselves , are two worthless , lazy chums who seemingly spend all their time making crank phone calls . They get in trouble when they get mixed up with mobsters Lazzaro ( Alan Arkin ) , Tony ( Vincent " Big Py " Pastore ) , and their crew . This flat , lazy , stupid , and boring " comedy " is not worth watching at all unless you like your laughs as immature as possible ( and get off on hearing epithets and expletives ad nauseum ) . I did not find these guys funny at one time during the movie . This movie gets old VERY quickly . Not to mention the fact that the " funny " voices that they use are dopey and unoriginal . No , the only thing worth mentioning about " The Jerky Boys " is the assortment of special appearances : musical performances by Tom Jones and Helmet , and cameo appearances by Ozzy Osbourne ( as Helmet's manager ! ) and Paul Bartel . There are some familiar old character actors in the supporting roles , but they are so poorly used it's sad . What possessed Arkin to appear in this ? Executive produced by Tony Danza and Emilio Estevez !
399540	1391795	295289	3.0	Tiresome and predictable .	Oh-so-familiar comedy story about low-key nice-guy Paul ( Jason Lee ) , who after the night of his bachelor party , wakes up in bed with Becky ( Julia Stiles ) , an attractive blonde he met just the night before . After lying about it to his fiancée Karen ( Selma Blair ) , he's forced to tell more and more lies to cover his tracks . I'm sure most of us have been witness to a story like this at least once before . . . on film or on TV . The movie is formulaic and EXTREMELY predictable , with an ending you may see coming a mile away . At least the cast provides some interest and keeps it watchable . Lee is just right in the lead , and Stiles is a lot of fun in a light-hearted comedic role different from the very serious roles she usually plays . Becky is a free spirit who seems to change jobs as often as other people change their clothes . But you know , this isn't exactly well-written . At least one question is left unanswered : for WHAT , exactly , is Ray ( Lochlyn Munro ) , Becky's brutal ex-boyfriend , being investigated by the I . A . ? And I didn't like the character of Buck ( David Koechner ) , Paul's stepfather ; he's a super-obnoxious moron who got on my nerves so quickly I was begging for somebody to punch him . Add another debit : a gratuitous , uncredited cameo by comic / actor Larry Miller , once again playing a grouch ( in this case , it's a little justified - his character is an ultra-conservative minister ) . Not good at all , but as usual for me , I give it a based on the efforts of the cast alone .
399608	1391795	338325	3.0	The cameos are amusing , but there's not much to recommend here .	Supposed " nice " guy Bo Laramie ( Cole Hauser , in his first star turn ) is the hot new action star of the moment ; as his first big film vehicle is opening , he is hounded by repellent , monstrous celebrity photographers led by Tom Sizemore ( in an admittedly great " bad guy " performance ) who endanger the lives of his family . So what does Bo do ? He goes after them with a vengeance . I didn't think that it was such a " fun " movie . I hated the alleged " hero " as much as the villains . I truly didn't think there was anybody to root for . It was unpleasant , as revenge thrillers often tend to be , and the way that these self-righteous filmmakers hammered us over the head with their all-too-obvious agenda mitigated against whatever enjoyment there might have been . This film has some good actors in it , but there are no really good roles . Everything is in black and white here , with no middle ground . And the detective played by Dennis Farina ( himself a real-life cop once , as if I need to tell anybody ) comes off as a dubious character himself in the end result . This film was heavy-handed , annoying , and stupid . I know I will inevitably get many negative responses to this review , but this is just how I felt . I disliked this film , and probably would have hated it outright were it not for my automated response to visceral type thrills .
399385	1391795	309530	3.0	It was a hard film for me to easily enjoy . . .	Parody of and tribute to Rock Hudson / Doris Day romantic / sex comedies from the 1960's ; this movie tells the story of a celebrated feminist author ( Renee Zellweger ) and the womanizing , superstar columnist ( Ewan McGregor ) who is determined to prove that she is a phony . Well , it's a triumph of 1960's-style production and costume design , if nothing else . One may have to be familiar with the kind of movies that this movie is sending up in order to appreciate it . It didn't really charm me , however - I found it to be pretty annoying and silly throughout and none of the upbeat , likable performances of the primary performers could make enough of a difference . It had me thinking " Oh my God " and rolling my eyes more than once - and that is never a good thing . It's very light and " airy " and is pretty forgettable once it is over . Zellweger has a lengthy monologue about 75 minutes into the movie that pretty much sums up the whole picture ! I guess it could be charitably described as a " personal taste " kind of movie - you will either be charmed by it or as annoyed as I was . At least it had small roles for ' Saturday Night Live ' players Rachel Dratch and Chris Parnell .
399658	1391795	106449	3.0	Even worse than " Prince of Darkness " , this is the worst thing Carpenter's ever done .	Fatally dull horror anthology with " Tales From the Crypt " aspirations in which film-maker John Carpenter , playing a Crypt Keeper-type coroner host , tells three stories . 1 . " The Gas Station " : Alex Datcher plays a young woman who has an eventful , spooky first night at her new job as a graveyard shift gas station attendant . Has some good Carpenter touches , but mostly uninspired story has only the prospect of Robert Carradine playing a psycho to recommend it . Frequent Carpenter actor Buck Flower plays a bum for the umpteenth time in his career . 2 . " Hair " : Stacy Keach plays a guy whose hair loss is driving him crazy . He goes to a special clinic , run by David Warner ( there's your first clue that they're up to no good ) . EXTREMELY dull , and dragged further down by Keach's over-acting , but has a fairly decent pay-off . 3 . " Eye " ( which is actually directed by Tobe Hooper ) : Mark Hamill plays a star baseball player who loses his right eye in a car accident , and in a " Hands of Orlac " type plot twist , receives a new eye from a donor whose identity is not revealed to him at first . Hamill is actually pretty good . In short , it almost seems as if Carpenter were asleep at the wheel when he made this ( he may also send the viewer to sleep ) . He may make little bits and pieces of the film entertaining , but on the whole the film is a failure . I'm so disappointed . Carpenter himself is reasonably amusing , and has cameos for two of his contemporaries : Hooper appears at the end , and - what have we here ? - there's Wes Craven appearing in " The Gas Station " ! Even Roger Corman pops up . Otherwise , don't waste your time with this piece of waste .
398961	1391795	82806	3.0	At least you get to see a victim yanked into a dumpster .	A killer goes on a spree during New Year's Eve celebrations , claiming a victim each time the clock strikes midnight in each time zone , directing all of his rage at a popular DJ hosting a night-long concert in L . A . Uninspired slasher movie , made with little to no talent or imagination , with zero scares , awful music , an unsympathetic lead , bad performances ( especially the psychiatrist ) , and very little of the elements ( namely , sex and violence ) that make hardcore slasher fans want to check these movies out in the first place . The rock music is actually fairly catchy ( in particular , the title theme song , which we get to hear repeatedly ) but some user comments have commented on an inaccurate depiction of the early 1980's new wave / club scene . ( To that end , the extras are often laughably crummy . ) The familiar faces give it some novelty value - Roz Kelly ( ' Happy Days ' ) as the diva-like DJ Blaze , Kip Niven - one of the motorcycle cops from the Dirty Harry sequel " Magnum Force " as the killer ( " No , not bad . Just EEEEEEEEvil ! ! ! " ) , whose true identity may be too easily figured out by some viewers early on , and Grant Cramer ( " Killer Klowns from Outer Space " ) as the too-obviously disturbed son . A very small victim role is played by veteran performer Louisa Moritz - often typecast in bimbo roles - whom you may have also seen in " One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest " or " The Last American Virgin " . Dedicated slasher fans could do better than this ; despite the fact that clearly more money was spent on this film than others of its ilk , it doesn't produce any better-than-average results . An early effort for Cannon Films , which went on to produce a large number of action films - often Charles Bronson and Chuck Norris vehicles , thrillers , as well as some genre efforts , throughout the 1980's . Good for some ( probably unintentional ) laughs , but not much more .
399217	1391795	97781	4.0	Your time could be better spent than watching this .	Legendary B producer and director Roger Corman has always been one to capitalize on mainstream successes . For " Jaws " , he had " Piranha " , and for " Jurassic Park " , he had " Carnosaur " . In 1989 , when underwater monster movies were a recurring idea ( there was also " The Abyss " , " Leviathan " , and " DeepStar Six " ) , his studio Concorde came up with this blatant clone of " The Abyss " . It has an undersea base coming into contact with too-cute manta ray shaped creatures with slowly blinking red eyes . Sexy researcher Clare ( ' Three's Company ' hottie Priscilla Barnes , looking too uncomfortable ) develops a connection to the creatures , while everything starts going bad due to the increasing instability of base commander Dobler ( Bradford Dillman ) . This dull , routine , unimaginative genre entry is just barely watchable . Mary Ann Fisher here has her only directorial credit to date , coming as no surprise . This could have benefited from more humor or flair but it's given a flat and too serious presentation . With the possible exception of Dillman , who's amusingly squirrelly , the cast generates no interest ( with Corman making an uncredited appearance as a corporate bigwig on a monitor ) . This is definitely one you can skip . You'd be better off just re-visiting " The Abyss " .
399484	1391795	87336	4.0	I didn't really care for this one too much . . .	Less-than-thrilling , routine slasher entry about demented sadist who butchers the mascot of a college basketball team and uses the costume as a disguise while reducing the amount of student bodies on campus with home made " claws " , while a night-long scavenger hunt takes place . A warning to the unfamiliar : you have to sit through a first half mostly consisting of obnoxious , asinine characters goofing off and providing comedy relief that is sometimes funny but mostly irritating . Then the hacking and slashing begins . The film provides the viewer with some atmospheric , suspenseful moments but mostly the film is a 97-ode to deja vu . The gore is amateurish , there's no sex quotient , and there's maybe one good scare in total . Some familiar faces can be seen : the top-billed Julie Montgomery was , of course , Betty Childs in " Revenge of the Nerds " , and co-star Lauren-Marie Taylor also fell victim to a killer in " Friday the 13th Part 2 " . Character players like Rutanya Alda ( " Mommie Dearest " , " Amityville II : The Possession " ) and Richard Bright ( " The Godfather " , " Red Heat " ) have small roles , and a slumming Hal Holbrook turns up presumably because his own son David also has a role in the film . I assume people who wanted to make slashers back in the early 1980's were exhausting themselves trying to come up with different costumes for their killers , but a bear costume ? That just comes off as looking silly . I wouldn't really recommend it - it's mostly for die hard slasher completists who aren't very demanding . I myself found the film to be silly and not very satisfying ( chalk up another underwhelming ending ) , and found my patience tested a little too much at times .
399891	1391795	73697	4.0	Not a complete waste of time , but doesn't measure up to Pam's classics .	Below average blaxpoitation action / melodrama in which the lovely Ms . Grier plays a private eye who comes to the aid of her father ( Rudy Challenger ) and his partner ( Austin Stoker of the original " Assault on Precinct 13 " ) whose loan business is being threatened . I'll be frank - I agree with the few other user comments for this movie . " Sheba , Baby " has a less than satisfying script , direction that isn't particularly distinguished , action scenes that are moderately entertaining at best , and one of Ms . Grier's more nondescript supporting casts ( although there's an important supporting role for D'Urville Martin , also a familiar name in blaxpoitation ) . I get the feeling that this routine movie may have been put together quickly merely to cash in on her then enormous popularity . It sure was cool seeing Stoker again , although Ms . Grier doesn't have as good a role - or dialog - as she has had in other films , although she is doing what she does best , and that's playing a sassy , sexy sister on a mission of vengeance . Non-stop soul / funk soundtrack is enjoyable , at the very least . Mostly recommended to those who wish to see everything in the Pam Grier film repertoire .
399462	1391795	77238	4.0	Disappointing effort from a proved comedy talent .	Ever lovable Tim Conway plays Vernon Praiseworthy , a perpetual screw-up who can't seem to hold on to a job . Then he receives news that floors him : he's the last living relative ( a nephew ) of a former hobo turned billionaire , Mr . Trayne ( a delightful Will Geer ) . Trayne is ready to leave his fortune and business to Vernon but wants Vernon to pass a test : live as a hobo and embark on a cross-country journey . I was expecting more of a series of vignettes , or slices of Americana , as the Praiseworthy character rode the trains . Instead , what happens is that this movie gets bogged down in an unfunny major plot about a dog-napping . The movie ends up plodding and not putting its star to good enough comedic use . On the plus side , " Bo " , the faithful canine companion , is wonderful , and the movie makes for fairly likable if rather uninspired family viewing . Conway is able to mine some scenes for laughs , but the movie is overall on the flat side . Co-star Eric Weston also appeared with Conway in the same years ' " They Went That-A-Way and That-A-Way " ; the movie also features Frank Sivero , John Myhers , and the late , great character actor Sydney Lassick . " The Billion Dollar Hobo " has its moments , just not enough of them .
399146	1391795	180274	5.0	Silly slasher movie ; has a somewhat creepy quality to it .	Low , low budget Oregon-filmed slasher about three attractive young girls who undertake a long road trip to attend a rock festival . A storm causes them to have an accident deep in the woods , and they end up in the mansion of the local eccentrics . The old lady living there has a passionate hatred of men , and rags on her daughter something fierce . And there seems to be a mysterious presence around , breathing heavily while leering through peepholes . Producer / director Don Gronquist knows , at least , what fans of these movies enjoy , so he obliges : there's tasty servings of full frontal female nudity , and some effectively graphic murders . The acting is just atrocious , with Virginia Settle as the old lady as far and away the worst offender ( bad acting is most often to be expected in this sort of fare , but it reached a new low for me here ) . Unfortunately , impatience was aroused rather than tension created ; the movie plods along and made me wait long stretches for the really interesting stuff to happen . The music is hilariously , perfectly dreadful . . . or should I say dreadfully perfect ? Gronquist gives the movie a decidedly odd quality ( very " Psycho " inspired ) and delivers a decent twist ending with a high kink factor , where it all becomes a matter of sexual repression and identity . It's also decidedly downbeat , which I wasn't expecting , so I can say that the movie did do a good job of keeping me off balance . Slasher fans who like to root out the more obscure stuff may want to give it a try . Personally , I found myself laughing more than anything else ; I wasn't entertained all that much . It has its moments , just not a lot of them .
399278	1391795	98184	5.0	Where have we heard this one before ?	Young boy who could never please his policeman father grows up to be a stone-faced , disturbed young psycho ( Judd Nelson ) who decides to start killing people when his plans to become a cop don't pan out . He is tracked by veteran Hollywood detective ( Robert Loggia ) who is saddled with new partner ( Leo Rossi ) who wants to show the older cop a thing or two about tracking down killers . The script , and the movie in general , are so routine and paint-by-the-numbers as to be laughable . The movie fails to provide a whole lot of entertainment value , but many of the actors ( including Nelson , offering a surprisingly decent performance ) manage to keep it watchable . Rossi is good and it's a shame this guy is rarely seen ( at least these days ) in mainstream movies . Loggia as always is excellent although his character comes off as a bit of a prick at first . And I always like it when I see Meg Foster ( as Rossi's wife ) in an ordinary role , given her tendency to be typecast as villainesses in B-movies . Lots of familiar faces here : George " Buck " Flower , Frank Pesce , Roy Brocksmith , Beau Starr , Ken Lerner , criminal-turned-author Edward Bunker ( as a cop ! ) , Angel Tompkins , et al . F . Y . I . Ken Lerner and Leo Rossi were also in " Hit List " , director William Lustig's previous movie released earlier the same year . They were also featured in scenes added to Lustig's 1988 movie " Maniac Cop " . Lustig himself appears as a cop .
398950	1391795	269095	5.0	Why Couldn't It Have Been Better ?	Inspired by a true story , and officially based on a magazine article , this movie makes the usual move of changing characters and events for the purpose of dramatic license . In the once glorious and now decrepit community of Long Beach , young junkie Joey LaMarca ( James Franco ) kills a dealer in the act of self-defense . His long-estranged father Vincent ( Robert DeNiro ) , who's a police detective , comes back into his life after walking out on him and his mother ( Patti LuPone ) years earlier . What seems like good material - sad and poignant and bitter , it charts the endless cycle of misery affecting each new generation of LaMarca men - is used to make a movie that somehow ends up unmemorable and not as moving as it ought to be . The cast is good , although DeNiro towers over all of them with a typically strong performance . This is another one of those cases where the skills of the film-makers and cast can only carry the picture so far . An OK but uneventful drama with some questions left unanswered at the end . There is an unfortunate disclaimer at the end of the closing credits - those scenes set in Long Beach were not even filmed there - where were they filmed , then ?
399088	1391795	74593	5.0	Not bad .	Landlocked version - some may rip-off - of " Jaws " as three heroes ( Christopher George , Andrew Prine , Richard Jaeckel ) unite to find and eliminate an enormous , ferocious grizzly bear that has been slaughtering and eating mostly female victims . Although pretty routine , I didn't hate it . It may pale next to " Jaws " , but it's a passable example of " nature-run-amok " thrillers . I mean , at least it wasn't boring . The acting and the music score were decent . I have watched 90-minute long movies that were worse wastes of my time . Kudos , anyway , to the actual bear used in the attack scenes ; he was very convincing . The kills are pretty gruesome . Speaking of " Jaws " , the most interesting bit of trivia from my standpoint is that the actress who played the memorable first victim in that other movie is also playing a victim in THIS movie .
399824	1391795	126527	5.0	A stupefyingly messed up movie .	This certifiably silly slasher entry is basically about a family struck by a series of murders . One family member in particular ( played by hardcore porno actress Samantha Fox ) has just gotten out of a mental hospital and is having a hard time dealing with the outside world . I just read one of the user comments here that said if one is new to the works of Doris Wishman , this is not the picture to start with . Uh-oh . If , like me , you are largely unfamiliar with this lady , she was one of the rare female film-makers to work in exploitation features . She was a true independent operator who did things her own way . She passed on in 2002 but left behind a large body of work spanning four decades . This attempt by Ms . Wishman to add to the slasher genre is largely bungled by the apparent loss of half of her rushes by the lab . The result is a disjointed movie that makes little sense from scene to scene , with mind-boggling changes in music and soundtrack that couldn't possibly be less appropriate to the scenes . The omnipresent narrator , a device which needed to be brought in to explain the whole " plot " , is good for some laughs , and Ms . Wishman does provide the viewer with two of the mandatory staples of the genre : gratuitous female nudity and plenty of juicy graphic violence . ( Gore fans are sure to get a kick out of this if they can put up with the balance of the movie . ) Pretty much everything about this is on the inept side , but it's so bizarre it's fascinating . I can't say that I actually enjoyed it , but it's such a demented curio that it kept me watching . A must for the curious . . . others , BEWARE .
399233	1391795	117611	5.0	Darn that company and their useless Canadian electricity . . . ( I can't remember the exact quote )	First off , I purchased this film because it was listed in a book created by Fangoria magazine that was dedicated to unknown , forgotten , and under-rated genre films . I saw it just this week in a bargain bin . I figured , what the heck , I'll pick it up , I won't be losing much , right ? Just a few bucks . Ultimately , the movie stumbles because it seems to exist for no other reason than to give an accomplished , veteran digital effects artist the chance to really indulge himself . That man is Jamie Dixon , here making his directorial debut . The film is based on what is probably one of Dracula creator Bram Stokers ' less popular stories . The title being is a sort of demon , conjured up by a stereotypical sect of renegade , darkness-embracing priests . The demon , who looks like a very poor imitation of Darth Vader with a VERY cheesy mask , speaks like The Djinn ( i . e . the villain of the " Wishmaster " series ) and is never remotely scary . The demon claims various unlucky morons in a small upstate New York town ( however , as it most often seems to be the case for these B-grade genre movies , the film was shot in Canada ) while on his way to snatching himself a supposedly " pure " child ( an early film credit for Kevin Zegers , whose other genre credits include " Wrong Turn " and the " Dawn of the Dead " remake ) for the purposes of vanquishing mankind . The actors are okay - they ARE professionals , after all - but don't really give this material better performances than it deserves . The exception to this , of course , is Tony Todd , who seems to be having fun playing the local recluse / nut job . Michael Rooker's character , a gun-toting priest who is afraid of the darkness in his own heart , is mildly interesting but it's not as if I've never seen a character like this before . That brings us to the digital effects , which get trotted out pretty frequently . Some of them are actually reasonably impressive , with standout moments involving transitions from live performers to puppets , dummies , or CGI ( just check out the scene where the young deputy gets a light thrown on him and perishes instantly ) . I'll be darned if they weren't more convincing than I would have expected . This is certainly a more lengthy analysis than such a routine , forgettable genre entry ( steeped deep in religious themes as many horror movies are ) should get . I'm just trying to get all my thoughts out . Was it worth a couple of bucks ? Yeah , it was okay . But I wouldn't be able to call it an unsung , overlooked little gem with a straight face .
398606	1391795	88961	5.0	" I see you like guns . What else do you like ? "	Another of the " Alien " clones - or should I say rip-offs ? - of the 1980's , in which a team of astronauts are pursued by a deadly beast that has made mincemeat of a previous mission . I know , this is not particularly GOOD , but it is made with some degree of competence - with special effects by the L . A . Effects Group , Inc . , who also worked on " Explorers " and " Aliens " . I thought that this group of film-makers stretched their minimal budget a fair bit and were able to deliver a fairly suspenseful and gory , if painfully derivative and formulaic , science-fiction / horror thriller . The cast is pretty unremarkable , with the only familiar faces being Lyman Ward - who played the clueless father in " Ferris Bueller's Day Off " - and the legendary Klaus Kinski , he of well over a hundred feature film appearances . In fact , Kinski is pretty funny at times , actually making the film worth seeing for some stretch of its running time . It might have helped if the creature weren't so obviously patterned after " Alien " ' s infamous killer . I admit once again that I may be too easy to please at times but I didn't consider " Creature " ( originally titled " Titan Find " ) to be an inordinate waste of my time . If you're a Kinski fan , you might want to check it out .
399561	1391795	127045	5.0	Let me ruin your evening . . .	Well , this goofy , gimmick heavy cult monster movie didn't ruin my evening . It's silly enough to be somewhat amusing . A dozen assorted creatures , each with its own style of dress and murder , emerge from inside the Golden Gate Bridge at night and slaughter people . They kill all of Natalie's ( Leilani Sarelle ) friends , and , of course , when she tells the cops what she saw , they refuse to believe her outlandish story . She makes friends with " nice guy " Steven ( Allan Hayes of " Friday the 13th : The Final Chapter " ) as well as spunky kid Paula ( Donna Locke ) , an avid horror buff who tries to get proof of the creatures ' existence and inadvertently discovers that their weakness is contact with good old fashioned H2O . This little known movie is so 1980's that it hurts , with an all-too-typical electronic music score that is really the crowning touch . The effects are not spectacular but they are acceptable . The picture might have been more fun if it were more stylish or energetic but the director Joseph Mangine is clearly not in his element - usually he's a cinematographer of B movies like " Squirm " , " Alligator " and " Alone in the Dark " ( 1982 ) . The film suffered some production problems , resulting in recasting of some of the creature performers as well as Mangine handling cinematography as well as direction after the original DP ( Oliver Wood ) left the production . Sarelle went on to play Roxy in " Basic Instinct " , and debuting actor Andrew Divoff , playing the role of " Doc " here , is now best known as the star of the " Wishmaster " series . " Neon Maniacs " is okay for what it is but that's about it .
399841	1391795	116731	6.0	" Come on , Mom , he's the big spaghetti-o . "	Annie Laird ( Demi Moore ) , a single mother and designer of rather unconventional art exhibits , agrees to serve on the jury for a mobster's ( Tony Lo Bianco ) trial , hoping for a little bit of excitement in her life . You know what ' they ' say , be careful what you wish for . Annie soon gets menaced by cunning , predatory mafia enforcer ' The Teacher ' ( Alec Baldwin ) , who threatens her that if the mobster does not walk free , then she and her son will die . It's probably been said enough how much this movie resembles the 1994 movie " Trial by Jury " . Regardless of who may have concocted the story first , this movie is okay . It's not really something special , but Moore convinces as a frightened and ultimately determined protagonist , and Baldwin oozes a great combination of charm and sleaze . Supporting them are folks who have since become highly familiar faces including Joseph Gordon-Levitt ( ' 3rd Rock From the Sun ' ) as the son Oliver , James Gandolfini ( a . k . a . ' Tony Soprano ' ) as a surprisingly reasonable and understanding mafia henchman , and Anne Heche as the best friend . Everybody is great in this , right down to the small parts , but it's really Moore's and Baldwin's show . The film itself is compelling enough . Annie is an easy person to sympathize with , and root for . It's a decent enough story with a good opening , some enjoyable twists and a satisfying denouement . I think it drags a little bit here and there , but it never becomes too hard to sit through . Basically , I liked it and felt that the acting made it a little better than average .
398876	1391795	295178	6.0	That's the way , uh-huh , uh-huh , he likes it . . . hey Goldmember . . .	Third Austin Powers has the titular super-spy / sex addict time traveling to 1975 , hooking up with old flame Foxxy Cleopatra ( R & B singer Beyonce Knowles ) in an attempt to apprehend Dr . Evil , who's aligned himself with a highly unattractive villain named ' Goldmember ' . Austin also has to rescue his legendary father Nigel ( guest star Michael Caine ) when Nigel is kidnapped by Goldmember's minions . An okay , decent comedy with enough laughs - and pizazz - to keep it watchable , although it wouldn't be an Austin Powers movie if there weren't some failed ( and some obvious ) jokes and a childish reliance on scatological humor . Knowles and Caine are the main attractions here , although there's an amusing role for former child star Fred Savage ( holey MOLEY ! ) Mini-Me returns - fortunately - and Fat Bastard returns - unfortunately . One thing you'll notice is that with each new entry in the series the quality of the star cameos keeps improving . The opening sequence is actually pretty good . Better than the first movie , but without the inspired moments of the second one .
398834	1391795	85750	6.0	The only ones I really wanted to root for were the dolphins !	Yet another product off the " Jaws " assembly line - this time , Michael Brody is played by Dennis Quaid and works at Florida's Sea World . His father , Police Chief Martin Brody , is nowhere in sight , yet Michael is visited by his boring and dopey kid brother Sean ( John Putch ) . Due to a faulty sea gate , a mammoth 35-foot shark slips inside the park , gives birth to a baby that dies when improperly handled by park personnel , and goes on a rampage . The theatrical version had the gimmick of 3-D effects , which this DVD does not . The 3-D is the only noteworthy aspect of a passable thriller that only really comes to life for the climax . The characters are bland and foolish and the dialog is sometimes just plain dumb . The absence of some of the original creative team behind the first two pictures is too apparent - " Jaws " was made with passion and skill , " Jaws 2 " with some skill but not so much passion , and this film with little of either . Of course , this picture is still better than the outrageously silly " Jaws : The Revenge " . Directing debut of Joe Alves , the production designer of the first two films , and it's not a great shock that he's directed nothing since , and since returned to what he does best . Just goes to show you the downward slope of this film series - the films got steadily less interesting with each new entry . Our new attraction at Sea World - floating , phony-looking corpses !
399015	1391795	83542	6.0	" Vengeance is mine , sayeth the Lord . . . HA HA HA HA HA ! "	Dr . Dan Potter ( Dwight Schultz ) is the new psychiatrist at " The Haven " , a mental institution with an unorthodox way of treating their patients . The guy in charge , Dr . Leo Bain ( Donald Pleasence ) is a touchy-feely , pot-smoking bloke who seems to be even more wacky than any of the people he's treating . The facility's security is run by electricity , and when a power outage takes place , the loosest screws in the institution - former P . O . W . Frank Hawkes ( Jack Palance ) , demented preacher turned arsonist Byron Sutcliff ( Martin Landau ) , overweight child molester Ronald Elster ( the late Erland Van Lidth ) , and a fourth guy whom I'd better not reveal anything about - escape , and terrorize Potter and his family ; somehow Hawkes has gotten it into his head that Potter murdered the group's former psychiatrist ! Serious , fairly effective horror thriller with the added element of familiar faces playing the villains . Landau overdoes it , but what the heck ? His campiness makes the character more fun than he might have been otherwise . The film as a whole is no great shakes but I think I was too hard on it the first time around . I realize now that there's more going on here than meets the eye , and that debuting writer / director Jack Sholder was somewhat ambitious with his script . I mean , it's no cookie-cutter , formula slasher film . The other performances are okay , but the plot twist involving the " fourth guy " is worth sticking around for , for it pays off in the end . Of course , there is a passing nod to the clichés of the era : a perky , attractive blond babysitter who is around long enough to start having sex and then pay a big price for it . At one point , the " fourth guy " dons a hockey mask ; while one may be tempted to think Sholder was ripping off " Friday the 13th Part III " , this movie was actually shot first . The music was nothing special but it was decent enough , and Tom Savini provides a very brief - maybe two seconds worth of screen time at most - makeup effect . New York " underground " group The Sic Fs - a gimmicky , macabre act that has to be seen to be believed - are around to play two songs . " Chop Up Your Mother " , anyone ? Overall , this is worth checking out if you're interested .
399279	1391795	314786	6.0	" Tell me more about ze ' wet bone ' . "	Modernized remake of memorable hit comedy from 1979 in which nerdy foot doctor Jerry Peyser ( Albert Brooks ) is plunged into international intrigue by reckless deep-undercover CIA agent Steve Tobias ( Michael Douglas ) , the father of the young man his daughter is marrying . Wow , I can't remember the last time a comedy was so hit-and-miss for me . I'd laugh , then I'd not laugh , then laugh , and so on . Overall , it's just supremely silly , but it's also refreshingly carefree - and hard to dislike . Works best as a vehicle for Brooks and Douglas , who are both great choices for their roles and play off each other very well . David Suchet is also very funny as the French bad guy Douglas is trying to broker a deal with ( he's the one who speaks the line that is the title of my review - and he does it hilariously ) . One good thing about it : it makes me curious to see the original Alan Arkin / Peter Falk movie . Filmed primarily in Toronto .
399111	1391795	70622	6.0	" 1 , 000 dollars to the person who can prove that the snake-man is not real ! "	Dr . Stoner ( Strother Martin ) , a prominent herpetologist , seems like a very nice , benevolent old gentleman , but he's really just your old-fashioned mad scientist . He hires a student named David ( Dirk Benedict ) supposedly for the purpose of research assistance , but David has in fact been selected to be the test subject for a revolutionary serum . 99-minute horror film that is actually rather serene until the effects of the serum on David go into overdrive . Once this starts , the film gets harrowing and one could get very sympathetic to David's plight . There are no real scares in " SSSSSSS " ( you don't say it , you hiss it ) but it has a certain something . I know I appreciated its subtlety , even though some may find it simply boring . The highlight has to be the makeup effects by John Chambers ( the man behind the special makeup design of the " Planet of the Apes " series ) and Nick Marcellino , and the final transformation scene . Performances are good , especially Strother Martin , who really does deserve more than just to be known as the " what we've got here is failure to communicate " guy from " Cool Hand Luke " . He does a great job of masking Stoner's insanity behind a veil of friendliness . However , I can see why some viewers may feel cheated by the ending . Not VERY good but a better-than-usual horror film for me .
399734	1391795	118689	6.0	Not as good as the TV skits .	Mr . Bean ( Rowan Atkinson ) is a slothful security guard at a London art gallery whose employers send him to America to accompany the painting " Whistler's Mother " , just so they can be rid of him for a couple of weeks . Bean wreaks havoc both in the American art gallery and in the lives of the family that he boards with . Although fairly well-paced , ninety minutes worth of Bean may be a little much . I have come to prefer the TV skits where Bean is nearly mute ; hearing him talk actually makes him less funny . Atkinson , who created the character with English comedy writer Richard Curtis , is clearly a talent to watch and the supporting cast serves as good foils for his manic silliness . Almost low-key at times , with some genuinely funny moments but none matching some of the more uproarious moments in the TV skits . The highlight is Bean's midnight trip to the art gallery , accompanied by an appropriate music score . The scenes in the hospital where Bean is mistaken for a doctor are also good . All in all , I like it - it's not great , but still above-average when I compare it to most comedies produced these days . ( By the way , my favorite Bean skit is when he goes to a public swimming pool - that episode rules . )
398622	1391795	105428	6.0	A man killed with corn-on-the-cob ! That's a first !	Original Stephen King screenplay about Mary and Charles Brady ( Alice Krige and Brian Krause ) who are , in reality , inhuman entities that get their nourishment from the essence of virginal girls , and are forced to constantly move from town to town in order to stay one step ahead of the law . In their current place of residence , Charles selects nice girl Tanya ( Madchen Amick ) as the latest meal , not realizing that his work is cut out for him this time . Overall , I look at it now and I believe that it's kind of lightweight fare . It's never remotely scary or intense - although there's enough gore , violence and profanity on hand to justify an " R " rating - with an awful lot of daytime material , and it's over pretty quickly and is eminently forgettable . That said , the screenplay has an enjoyable amount of offbeat humor , and Mick Garris directs just well enough . The acting is generally good , with the incredibly alluring Ms . Krige - who has yet to be really appreciated by a mainstream audience - in a standout performance . The special effects are very impressive , as well . In addition to our leads , the supporting cast features such familiar faces as Jim Haynie , Ron Perlman , Glenn Shadix , and as Tanya's parents , Cindy Pickett and Lyman Ward , whom any 1980's movie fan will realize also played husband and wife in " Ferris Buller's Day Off " . Bit parts are played by the likes of Rusty Schwimmer ( " Jason Goes to Hell : The Final Friday " ) , Ernie Lively ( " Simon Says " ) , Diane Delano ( " Jeepers Creepers 2 " ) and Stuart Charno ( horror fans will remember him as " Ted " from " Friday the 13th Part 2 " ) . Last but not least , there's an assortment of genre-favorite cameos by King himself ( of course ) , Tobe Hooper , Clive Barker , John Landis , and Joe Dante ; even an uncredited Mark Hamill makes an appearance . The director's wife Cynthia , a frequent performer in his projects , plays Laurie here . The film makes good use of a haunting , ominous earlier song by Enya called " Boadicea " , and , appropriately enough , an instrumental rock song called " Sleepwalk " gets played at least three times . Cat lovers may be pleased to see felines take on a proactive role in a horror film , but be warned that there are also repeated scenes of cruelty to cats ( Sleepwalkers have a critical aversion to them ) . This is fair horror entertainment . It's absolutely nothing special , but , like I said , it does have some things going for it , and it's certainly not among the worst examples of King-based cinema in existence . I think it deserves a little better than a 4 . 3 average .
399924	1391795	47966	6.0	Fun if forgettable .	Six members of the Air Force are on leave in Asia , during WWII , during which time one of them gets the bright idea to sneak into a ritual performed by local snake worshipers . As you can expect , they get found out , and a curse is placed upon them . When they finish their tour of duty and return to the States , they start dying off - each bitten by a cobra . I have to admit , the title was what drew me into this one . It sounds like fanciful , campy fun , and that's pretty much what the movie delivers . The mystery element is very unsuccessful , despite the filmmakers ' attempts to be subtle - it's very easy to figure out what's going on and what gorgeous stranger Lisas ' ( Faith Domergue , of other 50's genre fare like " It Came from Beneath the Sea " and " This Island Earth " ) big secret is . But at least it's a highly amusing variation on murder mysteries ( the " cobra vision " is an engaging little gimmick ) , played straight by its capable cast , including Richard Long , Marshall Thompson , Jack Kelly , and David Janssen . The idea that assorted animals in the movie - a dog , a cat , a horse - can sense the evil presence was another mildly amusing twist as well . The music , atmosphere , script , and direction are all perfectly adequate . Although the finale is ultimately underwhelming , it doesn't put too much of a damper on a fun minor Universal 50's genre flick . One may have to be partial to this sort of movie to begin with , but I'll come right out and say that I enjoyed it .
399925	1391795	72179	6.0	Flawed , dated , but somewhat appealing little drama .	College students Robert ( Peter Hooten ) and Jenny ( Kathrine Baumann ) travel to the Northern California wilderness to find old friend Michael ( Robert Englund ) , who's dropped out of sight . They arrive at his remote cabin , and while waiting an awfully long time for him to actually make an appearance , Jenny is raped by two local yokels ( James Keach and David Pritchard , who both also worked on the script ) in the now-familiar " Deliverance " tradition . A rather obscure character-driven drama , " Slashed Dreams " is not as exploitative or horrifying as some people will likely be hoping for . It's a most often slow and quiet meditation on such things as personal philosophy and identity , the idea of how to get over a personal trauma , the value of friendship , the way that times change , and the loss of innocence . I found it kind of appealing , once I realized that it wasn't going to be what I thought . Like some other folks , one thing I wanted to watch it for was Englund , but he doesn't appear until late in the film . It's still interesting to see him play a really drippy " nice guy " . The performances are likable and sensitive enough , and the two goons are not terribly frightening or intimidating ; as we can see , they're not very good at what they do . The relentless onslaught of wistful , maudlin folksy ballads gets to be way too much after a while ; I desperately wanted that stupid singer to just shut up . What little nudity this film has is fleeting and much too tastefully done ; even the climax where Robert confronts the rapists is not done in a go-for-the-throat fashion - it's anticlimactic and boring , and doesn't really resolve anything , despite what Englunds ' character says . Pretty scenery and the prettier Baumann help to break up the tedium . The cameo by legendary entertainer Rudy Vallee as a proprietor who practices a nightclub act in between waiting on customers is very nice , even if he's basically playing the time-honored role of the character in genre fare who utters a " Don't go in the woods " type of warning . Peter Brown of such flicks as " Foxy Brown " and " Rape Squad " has the other cameo as a college professor at the outset . It's not terribly well written , or very interesting overall , but it did have some appeal for me , at least as something of a curio .
399439	1391795	83111	6.0	Born on the bayou . . .	A variation on " Deliverance " in which the protagonists are a macho unit of the Louisiana National Guard , and the antagonists are nasty Cajuns who take exception when the Guardsmen borrow their canoes ( of course , it doesn't help that one of the Guardsmen fires his blanks at the swamp dudes ) . What results is a fight for survival in an oppressive setting . As a lean , mean action film , this is definitely alright . The protagonists are by and large unlikable and some viewers might feel that everything that they get they deserve . The Cajun hunters are largely kept off-screen and we don't even get to see their faces until near the end , which helps to keep their characters more intriguing and unnerving . The film moves at an acceptable pace and while the lead characters don't evoke a lot of sympathy , their plight makes for some entertaining tension and scenes of action . The cast is a big plus , and I do have to say that the Louisiana swamp setting is an inspired one . The Guardsmen have to find their way out by themselves , with the vegetation so thick that it would make rescue efforts difficult . The finish is actually more subdued than one might expect , although there is some great Cajun music to be heard in the final half hour . Composer / performer Ry Cooder , who has done other work with co-writer / director Walter Hill , has created a music score that is also effective . This film wasn't overtly impressive but it certainly had its assets and it was a reasonably entertaining experience .
399348	1391795	122070	6.0	A rather amusing obscure slasher item .	" The Forest " features two grown-up couples : Steve ( Dean Russell ) & Sharon ( Tomi Barrett ) and Charlie ( John Batis ) & Teddi ( Ann Wilkinson ) . Steve & Charlie decide that for some R & R they'll go on a camping trip and make the mistake of suggesting to Sharon & Teddi that they wouldn't be able to hack it on such an excursion . So Sharon & Teddi go off on their own camping trip , to be joined by Steve & Charlie later . But they'll all wish they had stayed at home . A demented man named John ( Gary Kent ) is living alone in the wilderness and prays on everyone he comes across . What's more , two children , Jennifer & John Jr . ( Becki Burke & Corky Pigeon ) appear to the victims to offer them assistance . The bad news : slasher fans who crave extreme violence and ample sex & nudity will be disappointed with this one . There's no sex or nudity , and while there is gore , it's used sparingly . The film gets off to a fairly good start with a reasonably well handled stalk ' n ' slash set piece , and delivers some creepy moments , as well as jump scares , but overall the film just isn't too spooky . The overbearing music score and songs also tend to distract from the effectiveness . At the least , writer Evan Jones and director Don Jones ( " Girls in Chains " ) inject a supernatural angle into the plot to keep it somewhat original among slasher fare . The film certainly doesn't play out like the standard slasher film . The forest locations are all used well and the photography is pretty good ( there's some especially good aerial shots ) . The acting is tolerable - for the most part - and some of the characters likable enough . There's one sequence involving the murder of a plumber that comes off as very comedic , but since it definitely feels like this was intentional , it's easy to enjoy . There's one brilliant moment of extreme dark humor wherein Charlie eats something that isn't a doe as John claims . And , finally , it's nice to see a slasher that doesn't revolve around horny , one-dimensional youngsters . It's more notable , I feel , for what it attempts than what it accomplishes . It's not particularly good , but not too bad , either .
399627	1391795	76798	6.0	Pretty routine made-for-TV horror , but watchable enough .	Two easygoing chaps played by Howard Hesseman and Tom Atkins purchase some coffee beans in Ecuador which they hope will make them lots of money back in the States . They unexpectedly get a little more in the bargain - some banana spiders ( not true tarantulas , as the later exposition will point out ) hitch a ride , and after putting the bite on the passengers , sink their fangs into pilot Atkins , causing the plane to crash near a tiny California town named Finleyville . Wouldn't you know it , the tarantulas survive the crash unharmed , and escape to the nearby orange processing plant , where many of the townsfolk - including fire chief Claude Akins , doctor Pat Hingle , and greedy , stupidly stubborn mayor / plant boss Bert Remsen - band together to stop the infestation . There isn't a whole lot of fun to be had watching this film , provided you aren't too demanding and haven't already had your fill of better arachnids-on-the-loose thrillers like " Kingdom of the Spiders " ( released to theaters the same year that this aired ) and " Arachnophobia " . It's not as if it's badly made or anything , but it's definitely lacking in any potent or memorable scares or suspense . A film of this kind should at least be squirm-inducing to some degree , but I didn't even find the spiders themselves that creepy . The film-makers get some credit for showing us how dead serious the situation is by taking the unexpected step of killing off a young boy , but otherwise this film is a little on the bland side , and even the climax isn't as exciting or suspenseful as it ought to be . Still watchable , thanks to some of the performances and the fairly steady pace , it entertains without really impressing . You could do worse , though .
398879	1391795	107050	6.0	I Didn't Feel Grumpy Watching This . . .	John Gustafson ( Jack Lemmon ) and Max Goldman ( Walter Matthau ) are lifelong neighbors and acquaintances who have been at each other's throats for a couple of decades . Their feud escalates when both show interest in the attractive , free-spirited widow ( Ann-Margret ) who has moved into the neighborhood . Not exactly spectacular , but likable and easy-to-take , comedy with some serious moments , this gets its points due mainly to an excellent cast - with longtime movie co-stars Lemmon and Matthau inhabiting their roles well , and being supported by some impressive co-stars . Movie's biggest draw is watching veteran Burgess Meredith ( as Lemmon's dad ) genially hamming it up as a randy old man who clearly loves sexual double entendres . The end-credits , which include out-takes , are worth sticking around for .
399709	1391795	45566	6.0	Decent murder mystery .	After his niece dies in the hospital , devoted Uncle Cam ( Joseph Cotten ) comes to learn that she was a victim of strychnine poisoning . The one person with the most motive and opportunity is the girls ' stepmother , Lynne ( Jean Peters ) , but proving her to be the guilty party is an arduous process to say the least . Although ultimately a rather forgettable thriller , it's reasonably engrossing and well-made with a solid cast also including Gary Merrill , Jack Kruschen , and a highly animated Catherine MacLeod . It does a good job of having us doubt the lead characters ' convictions as well as to whether Lynne is actually guilty . It's a tightly paced film clocking in at a mere 77 minutes , and while the plot may not be airtight , it's entertaining enough to maintain interest . The best sequence occurs near the end in a confrontation between Cotten and Peters , which doesn't quite pay off the way that we think it will . It throws more doubt at the viewer for a last-ditch touch of ambiguity . I liked this little picture well enough ; while not destined to be a classic in any way , shape , or form , it's just fine for what it is .
398770	1391795	234890	6.0	Five for the movie , an extra point for Kari Wuhrer .	Thoroughly average but basically watchable thriller about young wife Ann ( Kari Wuhrer ) , whose husband commits suicide after being passed over for a promotion that he badly needed . Ann decides to save the bulk of her wrath for the career woman , Nicole ( Barbara Crampton ) who inherited her late husband's job . She connives her way into Nicole's household by murdering their housekeeper , Karina ( Peggy Trentini ) and setting herself up to take Karina's place . She ingratiates herself with most of the family , even going so far as to seduce both husband and son ( at least she kept it in the family ) . Although it's got enough goofs to push credibility past the breaking point , I found it entertaining . Not good at all , but entertaining . It's at least a very sexy film ; the sex scenes and nudity are a prime asset . Director Jim Wynorski , using his pseudonym Jay Andrews , at least keeps that asset prominent and moves his trashy , melodramatic , ridiculous " The Hand That Rocks the Cradle " variation along at a respectable clip . The actors fill out their roles adequately enough , and it's all a fair bit of sleazy fun . That's provided one can turn off their brain before watching , granted , but it's possible to be amused by the whole thing . As a vehicle for the stunning Wuhrer , it's a success on that term . She's very easy to watch throughout . It's also nice to see Wynorski and Crampton working together several years after the film " Chopping Mall " . I had a good enough time watching this one .
399536	1391795	133046	6.0	Six Out Of Ten .	Black comedy about three high school students ( Katie Holmes , Marisa Coughlan , and Barry Watson ) who confront their icy , miserable history teacher ( Helen Mirren ) in her house and wind up in a series of events that snowball out of control . Supposedly , debuting film-maker Kevin Williamson ( the writer of " Scream " and " Scream 2 " ) based Mrs . Tingle on an actual teacher that he had in school . While I am amazed that any teacher could be as evil and heartless as this one is , I was generally amused by the picture . Make no mistake about it , though : don't rent or buy it thinking it's going to be some sort of thriller or suspense story ; it's basically goofy stuff that ought not to be taken seriously . The cast is fine , but none of them can quite match Mirren , who hits just the right note as Mrs . Tingle - she is completely convincing , although like I say , the source of her evil is dumbfounding and never really explained by Williamson . One source of amusement is a bit of casting that kind of comes full circle : Molly Ringwald , once a teenaged star of teen-oriented movies , plays a school employee in this film . I thought it was entertaining but nothing special ; " fairly good " is how I think I would put it .
399753	1391795	90184	6.0	A mildly amusing serving of 80's trash .	Betsy Russell is " Tommy " , the title character who enjoys tinkering with automobiles and is quite the good mechanic . She meets Randy Starr ( Gerard Christopher ) , a hunky racing champion whom she crushes on , but to whom she is determined to prove that anything he can do , she can do just as well . " Tomboy " is a likable enough comedy that , like many of its kind , strongly evokes the 80's era . Granted , I think it could have done without a subplot involving Tommy's uninhibited friend Seville ( Kristi Somers ) that isn't even resolved , and it gets too cute and sappy at times , but it's comfortably predictable . It's got lots of cheesy 80's pop tunes , and doses of sex , flesh , and sleaze are high enough . It's not terribly funny , although it has its moments . ( Seville's raunchy donut commercial is hilariously silly . ) It definitely takes its message of female empowerment pretty seriously . It does work as a vehicle for the charming and sexy Russell , who is certainly easy to watch . Standing out in support is veteran Richard Erdman , as her father-figure boss at the garage , with Eric Douglas ( son of Kirk and brother of Michael ) perfectly smarmy and sleazy as a spoiled rich kid . Basically , it's all pretty typical and unmemorable . It's bouncy , harmless , and hard to completely resist . At least it knows its audience and how to appeal to it .
399114	1391795	203425	6.0	It shouldn't have been any fun , but I actually kind of liked it !	Routine , predictable " B " monster movie - this one about a giant crocodile - in which the rampaging animal devours anyone and everyone in its path after someone has been foolish to mess with the things ' nest of eggs . Everything about this is obligatory - the attractive and incompetent cast , the gore , the frequent ( yet effective ! ) shock moments , the rock songs on the soundtrack . Tobe Hooper , the one-time master who gave the world the original " Texas Chain Saw Massacre " as well as one of the better haunted house movies ever made ( " Poltergeist " ) , continues a downward slide with this horror movie I imagine will only be seen by devoted aficionados of " B " movies . Too bad , for a director who's clearly had more failures in his career than successes . Of course , this is not his first crocodile movie - about a quarter century ago , he also made 1976's " Eaten Alive " ( which featured an early role for future horror icon Robert Englund ) . I was actually expecting to totally and completely despise this movie - I thought I would be able to revel in some genuinely , gloriously awful " B " movie trash ( sometimes , when a " B " movie is awful , that can actually be a good thing , to which I'm sure other people will agree ) . However , there is an occasional flash of quality in this movie - thanks to the K . N . B . effects team , there are times when the crocodile almost looks realistic ( please note , the croc was a combination of animatronics and CGI , not JUST CGI ) . The characters are so one-dimensional , and the cast so clueless as to how to make them sympathetic and likable , that the result is that - as is often the case in films of this kind - to root for the monster instead . Outside of Annabelle ( Julie Mintz ) and her dog , I didn't care about these people . I didn't want to see them survive . " Crocodile " is what it is . It's not exactly a good movie , but it was mildly , mildly enjoyable .
399053	1391795	758730	6.0	Entertaining to a degree .	AVPR picks up where its predecessor left off , and in short order a spacecraft carrying the new deadly menace of the " predalien " and a multitude of facehuggers has crash landed on Earth , outside a small Colorado town which is quickly infested . A sole Predator comes to clean house , while a small group of human survivors struggles to get to safety . This latest entry in the ongoing Alien and Predator franchises is long on action but short on sense and scares . It's got plenty of intense violence , slime , and gore ; at least I can say that it's not boring . The film-makers had cinematographer Daniel Pearl shoot everything very dark , which would have worked had they really been going for the traditional element of suspense , but in an action-oriented film of this kind , the result is to make things incoherent . The characters are hardly worth caring about , nor are their stories compelling or original in the slightest . I did appreciate seeing Reiko Aylesworth as a Ripley-style action babe ( a soldier who's just returned from Iraq ) , but the other performances are barely adequate . Its attitude of anything goes - children are not spared here , and there's one doozy of a creepy maternity ward sequence - does work in its favor . It's got some interesting details here and there - a fleeting glimpse at the Predators ' home world , or the ending that brings everything full circle - but overall it's pretty simple , straightforward popcorn fare , no matter how nasty or visceral it is . Folks hoping for more substance really ought to just re-visit the earlier entries in both the " Alien " and " Predator " series .
399274	1391795	249478	6.0	I thought that this one was pretty good .	Frank Morrison ( John Travolta ) is a hard-working boat builder and devoted dad who is naturally wary of the new man ( Vince Vaughn ) in his ex-wife's ( Teri Polo ) life . His wariness turns into outright distrust when his son ( Matt O'Leary ) says that he saw this guy commit a murder . The problem is , nobody will believe the kid because he has a history of lying and getting into trouble . Frank becomes the only one who will believe the kid's story . Enjoyable thriller is maybe a little bit better than most because it's actually mostly believable instead of contrived . It's a modest little movie , predictable as many thrillers are , but not unbearably so . It is also helped by genuinely good acting , especially by Travolta and Steve Buscemi , who plays the murdered man ; refreshingly , Buscemi's character is not as quirky as others he's played before . Even O'Leary as the kid delivers an acceptable performance . The only thing that I had a problem with was that Polo looks a little too young to be playing the mother of a 12-year-old . " Domestic Disturbance " is a good vehicle for Travolta and a good directorial effort for Harold Becker .
399541	1391795	75263	6.0	" Cops ! JS ! Screw ! "	The delivery of these three words by Dana Elcar gave me a big laugh , and probably more entertainment than the balance of the film ! That's not to say that it's a bad film . While the plethora of twists and turns require one to pay close attention , it's a slick and quick-paced mystery / thriller that provides Charles Bronson with one of his better roles ( he also happens to give one of his better performances ) . Bronson also gets a truly excellent supporting cast . John Houseman seems to be relishing his role as a devious rich man who hires Bronson's ex-newspaper columnist / would-be novelist as a " go-between " ; that is , his job is to exchange a hefty sum of money for a set of ledgers that had been stolen from Houseman . Nothing is quite what it seems in this movie in which Bronson has to figure out what is going on , and who is what , while extricating himself from the mess he's gotten himself into . People start dropping off left and right until a showdown at Houseman's estate . A decent film that should deliver the goods for Bronson fans . However , the biggest attraction for me remains , as it was the first time that I saw it a number of years ago , the chance to see a much younger Robert Englund and Jeff Goldblum as two of the three punks who attack Bronson at one point . Jacqueline Bisset , Maximilian Schell , Harry Guardino , and Harris Yulin round out the main cast ; other players include Michael Lerner , Elisha Cook Jr . , Dick O'Neill , and Daniel J . Travanti . The late , legendary stuntman Dar Robinson plays a guy falling to his death . Composer Lalo Schifrin contributes a typical 1970's style jazz score that instantly reminded me of his " Dirty Harry " work . It's nothing special although I would definitely consider it superior to some of the films Bronson headlined in the 1980's .
399072	1391795	325214	7.0	Decent slasher hijinks for those who don't take their horror too seriously .	This fairly amusing bit of junky nonsense involves an undead miner , Jeremiah Stone , who long ago made a deal with the devil and placed a curse - fairly typical stuff for a horror movie villain . What he really aims to do is keep other peoples ' mitts off his precious gold - by any means necessary , of course . When an all-too-typical troupe of 20-something idiots decides to play treasure hunt , they buy themselves a whole lot of trouble . " Silly " would be the easiest way for me to describe this . It sure isn't scary in the slightest ; right off the bat it shows the villain being resurrected and wastes no time in giving him victims to messily dispatch . It does have a feeling of " let's just have fun " to it and therefore is kind of hard to resist . Slashers fans need to be warned in advance , however , that it's pretty low in the sex department , and that , despite some decent splatter and makeup effects , may not be as gory as some viewers would prefer . Those interested ( such as I was ) by the presence of veterans such as John Phillip Law , Richard Lynch , Vernon Wells , Martin Kove , Jeff Conaway , and Karen Black should also know that most of their roles are rather small ( Law , Wells , and Kove were also associate producers ) . The inimitable Black makes the biggest impression , playing a nicely kooky ( if clichéd ) role , although Wells ( probably best known by most people as Wez in " The Road Warrior " and Bennett in " Commando " ) has fun as the human incarnation of the mad killer . As could be expected , not much can be said about the younger cast members , although I found Carrie Bradac really cute and appealing and Alexandra Ford is an undeniable hottie . If you don't mind a horror movie that makes you laugh rather than scaring you , you might find this up your alley . Even if it's standard-issue , disposable stuff , it's possible to derive some fun out of it .
398687	1391795	77889	7.0	Good job by all concerned .	Adapted by veteran writer William Goldman from his own novel , this tale would almost certainly fall under the " psychological thriller " description common to a number of todays ' films . Sir Anthony Hopkins is Corky , an awkward , timid type who tries his hand at magic but doesn't become a success until he adds a distraction / sidekick in the form of his crude , outrageous dummy , Fats ( voiced by Hopkins himself ) . Corkys ' agent , Ben Greene ( a typically grandiose , wonderful Burgess Meredith ) gets for him a deal for a TV pilot ; however , Corky is afraid to fail the required medical exam , and hightails it to a lakeside cabin where he reconnects with high school crush Peggy Ann Snow ( Ann-Margret ) . As the film progresses , Corky becomes more hopelessly dependent on Fats and less and less stable . It's all about the acting in this intriguing , subtle , somber , and reasonably creepy little thriller : the endearingly humble and soft-spoken veteran thespian Hopkins offers proof that he's always at his best when playing characters who are , if not outright villainous , at least damaged or off-putting in some way . Yet , for all his inner anguish and antagonistic tendencies , Hopkins makes Corky sympathetic , helping what is essentially a deliberately paced film over its slower portions . Ann-Margret is definitely appealing as the wistful Peggy , and Ed Lauter does a bang-up job in the role of a boozing , distant , inadequate husband that is fortunately more than just one-dimensional . A little more blood is shown than one might expect for veteran actor-director Richard Attenborough , who agreed to direct this picture basically for the purposes of raising money for his Oscar-winning biopic " Gandhi " . Here he directs with a sure hand , making " Magic " a rather classy , rather than merely exploitive , affair . The cloudy skies throughout help to set the dour mood of this tragic story , and Jerry Goldsmith's truly excellent music score is perfect accompaniment . Fats himself becomes an appropriately uncomfortable presence ; there's just something inherently creepy about dummies and this film certainly makes that point clear , if nothing else . These are all good reasons for watching " Magic " , but the bottom line is to see it for Hopkins's performance . He is definitely the star attraction here .
399681	1391795	85811	7.0	Corny , cheesy , not particularly imaginative , but still good fun .	Riding the wave of other genre pictures from the late 70's to the early 80's , Columbia Pictures gave us this contribution . A mixture of science-fiction , fantasy , and adventure , it sees an all-powerful " Beast " landing on a planet inside a " Black Fortress " that can disappear and re-materialize on a 24 hour basis . With the help of thuggish " Slayers " , this evil creature starts decimating the population and abducts young princess Lyssa ( Lysette Anthony ) , while she's in the process of marrying young warrior Colwyn ( Ken Marshall ) . Colwyn , spurred on by feisty Ynyr ( Freddie Jones , delivering the standout performance of the picture ) , hooks up with a motley gang of thieves who become his steadfast allies . All of this while he's managed to obtain a magical flying weapon dubbed " The Glaive " . The $27 million production can be easily seen in a number of impressive sets shot at the renowned Pinewood Studios . These range from a massive chamber full of cobwebs , presided over by " The Widow of the Web " ( Francesca Annis ) , to forests , canyons , & swamps and the stylized lair of The Beast . Coupled with the generous array of special effects , this picture certainly delivers the goods in visual terms . Veteran director Peter Yates , who's shown an impressive ability to work within a variety of genres in the course of a distinguished career , does good work at creating some enjoyable set pieces . The whole sequence with Jones and Annis is rather poignant and for me was the highlight of the movie ; in fact , the supporting cast tends to outshine leads Marshall ( who is a very likable sort with a resemblance to Dennis Quaid ) and Anthony ( very pretty and enticing ) . Future stars Liam Neeson and Robbie Coltrane are among the thieves . Alun Armstrong , whom you may have seen in one thing or another , is fun as Torquil and David Battley supplies the movie with its silly comedy relief as he changes into one animal form - goose , pig , basset hound - after another . Nice exterior location shooting and a nicely rousing early score by James Horner also help in the enjoyment of this amiable movie .
399713	1391795	68370	7.0	A most amusing zombie romp .	Bossy theater group leader Alan ( Alan Ormsby , in a memorably and deliciously smarmy performance ) brings his hapless troupe to an island cemetery . Here he involves them in rites intended to raise the dead . Little does he know how well this will pay off . While the accent on the ( admittedly very funny at times ) dialog gives me an indication of how low the budget must have been on this one , the rawness of the whole thing actually adds to the appeal for me . Assisted by Carl Zittrers ' appropriately weird ( and I do mean weird ) music score , writer / director Bob Clark ( billed here as Benjamin Clark ) establishes reasonably good atmosphere as well as a sense of claustrophobia later on , as the zombies lay siege to the actors as they cower inside an empty building . The zombies themselves are mighty impressive ; Ormsby , who also gets a screenplay collaboration credit , even did the makeup himself , and for low budget stuff , it's really very well done . The picture is rather slow for the most part , focusing more on interaction with the characters . Then , about 20 minutes from the end , it finally kicks into gear in a well-executed post - " Night of the Living Dead " onslaught of the living dead . However flawed , I can't deny that " Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things " ( a great title , indeed ) does have its charms . Fans of living dead films should get a bit of a kick out of it . Ormsby and Clark would go on to collaborate on " Deathdream " ( a . k . a . " Dead of Night " ) ; co-star Anya Ormsby ( as the delightfully spacey Anya ) was Alans ' then-wife .
399190	1391795	50294	7.0	Good for fans of the giant monster movies of the 50's .	An enormous prehistoric preying mantis is unearthed in the Arctic and proceeds to go on the expected rampage until our heroes find out what they're up against and try to stop it . Said heroes include a paleontologist , Dr . Jackson ( William Hopper ) , his associate , Marge Blaine ( Alix Talton ) , and stoic Col . Parkman ( Craig Stevens ) . It might not rank right up there with two of my favorite classics from the period - " Them ! " and " Tarantula " - but " The Deadly Mantis " is really not a bad movie at all . It has the same reliance on dialog ( full of exposition ) as many of the other movies from the period , and isn't as interesting when the monster isn't doing its thing , but it holds up fairly well . The special effects are rather decent ( this monster is at the least more convincing than that Muppet-like alien buzzard in " The Giant Claw " ) , maybe not so much when the monster is seen in long shot , but they're good enough , and the movie is well done and , for me , anyway , not in the least laughable . Some sequences late in the movie work particularly well , when the monster is on the loose in the fog , and the climax in the Manhattan Tunnel , when it's easy to start feeling some pity for the monster . Director Nathan Juran , one of the prolific genre directors of the period , does a good job , especially when it comes to the action sequences . The little bit of humor there is - particularly , military men acting like little boys when meeting Marge because they so rarely see women - definitely gave me some chuckles . The acting is perfectly acceptable , as well . If you're like me and are partial to these movies to begin with , " The Deadly Mantis " may do just fine for a dose of giant killer insect mayhem .
398624	1391795	68458	7.0	Everybody , say it with me . . . " Mind the doors ! "	In 19th century London , tunnel workers were buried in a cave in , but managed to survive for many years , and in 1970's era London , the last living descendant of these underground dwellers is about to make his presence known to the outside world . This isn't really your standard issue horror movie . It's quiet , slowly paced ( VERY slowly paced at times ) , and never builds to a frenetic pace or melodramatic finish . It's a moody , interesting , offbeat thriller ( with touches of graphic horror here and there ) with a highly amusing Donald Pleasence as the surly Inspector Calhoun - he's not really in Dr . Loomis territory here , but the character is kind of a hoot in his attitude . This little film is actually most effective when going for pathos : the cave-dwelling " Man " ( Hugh Armstrong ) is a tragic figure who is clearly not doing anything out of genuine malice . His grief and loneliness play out very well ; he's the kind of antagonist that can arouse genuine pity from a viewer , giving the movie additional resonance . The cast does good work , particularly Pleasence , Armstrong , Norman Rossington , and an all-too-briefly seen Christopher Lee ( who has only one scene , but makes it count ) . David Ladd , as the young American student in a relationship with a local girl , plays a seemingly heartless individual , and he doesn't really make this character likable or interesting in any way . Sharon Gurney , as the girl , is more appealing , although it's unfortunate that she's pretty much destined to be the film's damsel-in-distress . The film has a good look to it , at least in the underground locations , which look quite impressively disgusting . The music is somewhat offbeat , again , this is a touch that seems to be going more for mood than generating fear or tension . On the whole , this is an intriguing picture worthy of some respect . Also known as " Raw Meat " , this marked the directing debut of Gary Sherman , who , after a long absence from film-making , returned to the States to make movies like " Dead and Buried " , " Vice Squad " , " Wanted : Dead or Alive " and " Poltergeist III " .
398972	1391795	83146	7.0	Fairly good slasher flick .	This rural slasher centers around Melissa ( Aleisa Shirley ) , a supposed 15-year-old beauty who figures prominently in a rash of killings ; the victims are young guys with the fatal tendency to lust after her . The local good ol ' boy sheriff ( Bo Hopkins , in the kind of role that he was seemingly born to play ) not only has to try to solve this baffling mystery , he has to deal with a detective junkie daughter ( " Friday the 13th Part III " cutie Dana Kimmell ) who keeps sticking her nose into the case , as well as local racist toughs ( particularly hulking Don Stroud as Billy ) who want to believe that the local Indians are responsible . The whole element of adding racism to a standard slasher story is one factor that makes this something unusual . Also , it's amusing to see a slasher with such a high mystery quotient . The movie follows one path most of the way through the movie , only for it to be revealed as a red herring with a last minute revelation that's unexpected since it comes from out of nowhere . Those expecting more of a typical slasher could very well be disappointed . Voyeurs will love seeing a protracted shower sequence no less than two minutes into the movie . The body count is awfully low , and although the murders are very violent , they may not be shown in enough detail to satisfy gore hounds . The cast is way above average for this sort of thing . The strong list of actors includes Patrick Macnee , Susan Strasberg , Don Shanks ( portrayor of The Shape in the fifth " Halloween " movie ) , Sharon Farrell , Michael Pataki , Henry Wilcoxon , and Larry Storch . My major beef is that drippy ballad that got to be way too much for me way too soon . Otherwise , this is a decent enough movie of its type and slasher enthusiasts / completists may want to check it out .
399033	1391795	93777	7.0	One of John Carpenter's more ambitious and provocative films .	" Prince of Darkness " is the second film in what Carpenter calls his " Apocalypse Trilogy " . It began with " The Thing " , and concluded with " In the Mouth of Madness " . We basically deal with the possible end of the world here . A cannister of green liquid is discovered in the basement of a run-down church . It's surmised that , after deciphering of a nearby text , that the liquid represents the son of Satan , soon to take form and bring his father into the world . All that stands between them and their goal are a group of graduate students , led by a professor named Birack ( the always wonderfully eccentric Victor Wong ) and an hysterical priest ( Donald Pleasence ) . " Prince of Darkness " is notable for the way it attempts to develop a link between science and religion . Our characters are using modern technology to determine the reality of concepts rooted in faith . Carpenter wrote the screenplay himself , using the pseudonym " Martin Quatermass " , and uses this little horror film to explore metaphysical beliefs . While its intellectual approach will not appeal to everyone , Carpenter does manage to create some creepy moments and atmosphere . His music score here is among the best that he's done - he certainly knows how to set a mood right up front - and creates a fairly intimate feel to his plot , with a limited amount of characters confined to a single location , and setting up a situation where escape is next to impossible . It has some decent enough jolts involving various manner of insects , passable makeup effects , and a scenario similar to that of zombie pictures with the students succumbing one by one and attacking each other with mindless determination . Now , granted , it's not without its sillier moments - such as a minor character making little effort to avoid getting killed - but it has its assets , as well . The dream sequences are a particularly intriguing plot point . While some of the cast members are rather nondescript , others come off reasonably well . Pleasence and Wong are entertaining leads , with Jameson Parker of ' Simon & Simon ' fame and gorgeous , underrated Lisa Blount likable enough in key supporting parts . Character actor Peter Jason , in his first film for Carpenter ( he went on to appear in " They Live " , ' Body Bags ' , " In the Mouth of Madness " , " Village of the Damned " , " Escape from L . A . " , and " Ghosts of Mars " as well ) is fun as Dr . Leahy , Dennis Dun ( who played Wang in " Big Trouble in Little China " ) is amusing as the skeptical Walter , and it's cool to see the legendary rocker Alice Cooper in a non-speaking bit as a nasty-looking " street schizo " . Overall , " Prince of Darkness " is not without its merits , and is a Carpenter film worth checking out or re-discovering .
399482	1391795	74455	7.0	Look out , Norman Bates . . . you've got competition !	In this freakish , outlandish follow-up to his memorable debut , " The Texas Chain Saw Massacre " , Tobe Hooper gives us this silly - yet still shocking and highly amusing - horror film that if nothing else gives us a good dose of cinematic insanity . Neville Brand plays Judd , a decrepit old fool who operates the Starlight , a back-of-the-beyond hotel , who for one thing can't seem to let his guests live long enough to be able to check out . For another , his pet crocodile , living in an enclosure right next to the hotel , just adds to the menace . Often in scenes just mumbling incoherently to himself , Brand is one of the highlights of this film . As is a very young looking Robert Englund , in one of his earliest film appearances , playing a sleazy and kinky lowlife and genially hamming it up in his time on-screen ( his first line proved to be so memorable that it got recycled by Quentin Tarantino many years later ) . Also along on this macabre journey are Carolyn ' Morticia Addams ' Jones in an unattractive character part , original " Texas Chain Saw Massacre " victim Carolyn Jones , obliged to go through more torture here , as well as Mel Ferrer , Stuart Whitman , William Finley ( his performance is as " out there " as Brands ' ! ) , and - providing impressive eye candy for those interested - Janus Blythe of the original " The Hills Have Eyes " , Roberta Collins , and Crystin Sinclaire . Child actress Kyle Richards , shortly before " Halloween " , got introduced to the genre here as a screaming tyke forced to spend much of her on-screen time crawling through filth . Also worth noting : the crocodile is the work of Bob Mattey , known for creating the giant squid in " 20000 Leagues Under the Sea " and Bruce the Shark in " Jaws " . While this won't stand up as the best of his work , it's not all that bad either . Omnipresent country and western songs are supplemented by a genuinely weird electronic music score concocted partly by director Hooper . Another thing I liked was the stylish - sometimes atmospheric - look of a number of shots , which is always a good thing in my book . Basically , this is not bad as these films go . It's fun for what it is .
399409	1391795	85121	7.0	Bronson once again does a great job of ridding the world of human scum .	Charles Bronson plays no-nonsense detective Leo Kessler , up against a cunning adversary . Warren Stacey ( Gene Davis ) is a good-looking guy who has one major thing working against him : he's a depraved creep . Whenever young women spurn his sleazy advances , he goes out and kills them ( in the nude , no less ! ) . However , even when Leo has established Warren as his killer , a serious lack of hard evidence practically guarantees that Warren will walk . So Leo crosses the line , and plants evidence , but when he's forced to admit to this , Warren does indeed go free . Leo begins harassing Warren until the jerk can take it no more and strikes back by targeting Leo's feisty daughter Laurie ( Lisa Eilbacher ) , a student nurse . " 10 to Midnight " was the first of six 1980's collaborations between Bronson and director J . Lee Thompson . It's not quite the standard cop vs . killer picture ; it's certainly kinkier and sleazier than some . There are copious amounts of both female and male nudity , the killer's victims are all attractive young ladies , and it even dares to be quite mean-spirited ( one girl is killed after having attended the funeral of a previous victim ) . It's trash , plain and simple , and enjoyable on that level ( although it's got a very clearly stated message about the inadequacies of the " justice " system ) . Bronson is in fine form as the kind of dedicated cop willing to do anything to get his man . The gorgeous Eilbacher has a great amount of spunk as the daughter . The cast is rounded out by Andrew Stevens as the young and much more by-the-book partner , Wilford Brimley as Bronson's superior , Geoffrey Lewis as a savvy lawyer , and Robert F . Lyons as the district attorney . They're all good , but Davis tends to steal the show , offering a real marvel of a performance as the clever creep . Kelly Preston has one of her earliest roles ( billed as Kelly Palzis ) as one of Laurie's fellow student nurses . It's not without some humor ( Bronson discovering Davis's sex toy is a priceless moment ) and it's all pleasantly easy enough to predict . Bronson and Davis make for a great pair of adversaries and while it's amusing to watch Warren as he carefully puts his plans into motion there's no denying the satisfaction in awaiting the eventual final showdown . And it culminates in an appropriate final line from Leo , letting us know that for every human monster in this type of film there will always be a hard-nosed relentless cop to track him down and put him in his place .
399073	1391795	58700	7.0	A good apocalyptic tale .	Robert Morgan ( Vincent Price ) is the title character , left all alone after a germ turns all other people into shambling creatures exhibiting both vampire and zombie traits . Eking out a precarious day-to-day existence , he spends his time either searching for these creatures and destroying them , or searching for other survivors . Taking an appropriately grim , despairing , and downbeat tone , this was the first adaptation of Richard Mathesons ' novel " I am Legend " to reach the screen . Matheson himself co-wrote the screenplay , using the pseudonym " Logan Swanson " . It captures a sense of isolation and loneliness - the sometimes deserted , sometimes corpse-strewn locations are utilized frequently to great effect . One memorable plot device is the dispatching of the creatures in a blazing pit that creates a nicely hellish image . Comparisons to George Romeros ' " Night of the Living Dead " are certainly apt ; one can look at a number of films from the era and see where the director might have gotten some inspiration for his later horror film . Refraining from ever getting really hammy , Price delivers an engaging performance and is a solid anchor for the film . This film being shot in Rome , the rest of the cast is made up of Italian actors , including Giacomo Rossi-Stuart ( " Kill , Baby . . . Kill ! " ) and ravishing beauties Franca Bettoia and Emma Danieli . Fine set decoration ( note the look of Prices ' house ) by Brunello Serena Ulloa and cinematography by Franco Delli Colli give the picture a good look . " The Last Man on Earth " is an entertaining little film even if the creatures themselves don't come off as very threatening or scary . It makes for an interesting comparison to the later cinematic adaptations , namely " The Omega Man " ( 1971 , starring Charlton Heston ) and " I am Legend " ( 2007 , starring Will Smith ) .
399162	1391795	93996	7.0	Hot babes , lotsa gore , tons of laughs . . . what's not to love ?	Courtney , the youngest survivor of the original " Slumber Party Massacre " , is now played by Crystal Bernard of ' Wings ' fame . She's a member of an aspiring rock band also consisting of hottie friends Amy ( Kimberly McArthur ) , Sheila ( Juliette Cummins ) , and Sally ( Heidi Kozak ) . Courtney regularly has nightmares about her ordeal ( enabling the film-makers to use a fair bit of archive footage ) , yet is now re-imagining the driller killer as a leather clad rock star ( a hilariously campy Atanas Ilitch ) whose drill is attached to the end of his guitar . And her nightmares somehow start coming real , as the rocker comes after her and her friends . Coming from Roger Cormans ' company Concorde , this is the kind of stuff that you know just ain't that good , but it's definitely good for some entertainment . The girls get crazy , get drunk , have a good time , take off their clothes , their boyfriends show up and clown around - it's all par for the course . The gore is actually pretty good , and there's a lot of it . My favorite is an over-the-top zit gag . Most importantly , writer-director Deborah Brock and company don't take themselves seriously at all . This gets positively goofy at times - the climax is played tongue-in-cheek , with the psycho stopping to do an impromptu musical number in the middle of a pursuit . I have to admit . . . I enjoyed " Let's Buzz " . These silly , sleazy slasher shenanigans are a real hoot .
399304	1391795	95963	7.0	Routine 1980's era buddy-cop movie enlivened by good cast .	The Governator plays Captain Ivan Danko , a humorless and utterly stiff Russian cop who tracks ultra-sleazy / nasty Georgian drug dealer Viktor Rosta ( Ed O'Ross ) to Chicago , where local detective Art Ridzik ( James Belushi ) , a crass , wisecracking jerk is stuck with the job of playing babysitter to Danko while he attempts to escort Rosta back to Russia . There are enough elements here that are too familiar to make the film itself more than ordinary . There's the fish-out-of-water concept , the mismatched-partners concept , the culture clash concept , and so on . It's true that the two protagonists are not terribly likable , but at least they do manage to get some laughs , and Schwarzenegger and Belushi do have an adequate amount of odd-couple chemistry . It's all entertaining enough ; director Walter Hill has been an action expert for about three decades now and at least he creates some competently staged fights and chase scenes . The supporting cast includes Peter Boyle , Belushi's gruff boss who isn't quite the stereotypical angry , yelling boss common to action films . Larry Fishburne is good as a co-worker of Belushi's who dislikes him intensely . Gina Gershon has one of her earliest roles as the hapless dance instructor who gets in over her head by agreeing to marry Rosta . Other familiar faces include some Walter Hill regulars ( like Brion James and Peter Jason ) , as well as Brent Jennings ( great in a brief cameo as a drug kingpin determined to strike back at white men by getting them all hooked on drugs ) , Pruitt Taylor Vince , Kurt Fuller , etc . This film does have the distinction of having scenes that were actually filmed on location in Russia , which is a little bit of a bonus . Mostly , I felt it was rather standard action fare , despite the assets it did have . One lasting impact was the fact that O'Ross's performance as the villain would often get him typecast as Russian characters from that point on .
399769	1391795	83336	7.0	Thus concludes the threesome of " Wolf " movies of 1981 .	In addition to " The Howling " and " An American Werewolf in London " , this picture came out , based on the novel by Whitley Streiber . Surly NYC police detective Dewey Wilson ( Albert Finney ) investigates savage murders that look like animal attacks , teaming with his coroner friend Whittington ( Gregory Hines ) and terrorism expert Rebecca Neff ( Diane Venora ) . A horror movie with a social and cultural conscience , this intelligent movie is well crafted and doesn't go for cheap thrills . Although the deaths are in fact gory , very little of the gore is actually shown on camera . Venora and Hines were just fine , although Finney seems half asleep and mutters a lot of his dialog . I know he's supposed to be ordinarily a fine actor , but this film could have benefited more from a more dynamic lead . There's a number of familiar faces in the cast , including Reginald VelJohnson of " Die Hard " 1 & 2 and ' Family Matters ' . Another thing I must say is that Edward James Olmos , cast as a Native American , at least seems like a better choice for his role than Armand Assante was for a similar role in " Prophecy " , which I watched last night . The film's strongest asset is its inventive photography , even if the prospect of showing things from the predators ' perspective is not exactly original . Also , one good move is to not give the audience a good look at the beasts until late in the film . How odd that this film and the 1970 documentary " Woodstock " are the only feature-film directorial credits for Michael Wadleigh to date . The recently deceased , legendary comic Alan King ( R . I . P . Mr . King ) was the executive producer .
398963	1391795	85450	7.0	It can send a viewer out with a smile on their face !	In this amiable , outrageous 1980's vehicle , star Dan Aykroyd plays Clifford Skridlow , a meek and mild type college professor who is roped into the prostitution business by a cowardly pimp ( Howard Hesseman ) who has contrived a new partner that Skridlow is ultimately obliged to bring to life - the titular character , whom in full garb looks like a punk version of Elton John at his most flamboyant . Hard to miss with this upbeat , infectiously goofy comedy , a true product of its decade which gets off to a true time-warp start with a catchy title-tune ditty by Devo . Aykroyd is well supported by a fabulous cast including his four gorgeous high-class prostitutes ( Donna Dixon - the soon-to-be Mrs . Aykroyd , Fran Drescher , Lynn Whitfield , Lydia Lei ) , T . K . Carter ( " The Thing " , " Runaway Train " ) who is lots of fun as his sort-of sidekick , Kate Murtagh ( the lady on the cover of the Supertramp album " Breakfast in America " ) in a humorously nasty crime kingpin role that would be ordinarily be played by a male , Nan Martin ( Mrs . Louder from ' The Drew Carey Show ' ) in a wonderful turn as a stereotypically dotty mother , and others . The dance sequence , supplemented by a musical performance by James Brown , has got to be the major highlight of the film for me ; it's just lots of fun to watch . Besides this sequence , other silly / amusing comic highlights include Aykroyd's extended introduction to the night life , his nightmare sequence , and his impersonation of a loud , obnoxious rube lawyer . The movie on the whole is certainly a great showcase for its star . You should definitely catch this if you haven't seen it yet . I wholeheartedly recommend it . It's unfortunate that this was a box office bomb back in its day . . . just too unfortunate . But hey , nothing can stop " The Doctor ! "
399365	1391795	60548	7.0	Pretty good stuff .	On a British island , scientists diligently work on a cure for cancer . However , their idea - a creation of a new life form - is no cure . These beings - looking a little like land born versions of the Martian spaceships in " War of the Worlds " - devour bones and turn their victims into " jelly " . A dedicated team of doctors - Edward Judd , Peter Cushing , and Eddie Byrne - seek to find out how to destroy them . A fairly interesting and fanciful plot works for this overlooked little horror item . Even the monsters , as low tech as they may be , are creepy in their own way . Director Terence Fisher draws the viewer in with a sharp sense of mystery until the secrets are revealed , and , in appreciable fashion , maintains a steady pace until the final third when he allows the action to speed up . An effective plot detail - the monsters are capable of multiplying on a regular basis - allows for more tension as the imperiled villagers have time working against them . The island setting is another good touch . The movie leads towards a decent climax , in classic " Night of the Living Dead " fashion , involving a siege . The monsters congregate and swarm over the building where the frightened villagers are holed up . An effective sense of panic is created . Cushing is as solid as always , with likewise fine performances from Judd , Byrne , and Niall MacGinnis . " Island of Terror " is an entertaining little horror film that's worth a look .
399553	1391795	74703	7.0	Very nice combo of blaxploitation and horror .	" J . D . ' s Revenge " is an Exorcist variation , set in New Orleans , in which a nice guy cab driver and law student ( affable Glynn Turman ) participates in a hypnotism session , which somehow allows the spirit of a deceased gangster , J . D . Walker ( David McKnight , oozing oily menace ) , who desires revenge on those who killed him . It's a reasonably engrossing and interesting picture , worth catching for the performance of Turman , who manages to convey two different personalities . It's also quite a showcase for Louis Gossett , Jr . , as a flamboyant preacher implicated in the plot . I've never seen him quite so lively , and he even cries at the end ! Joan Pringle is quite cute and appealing as the befuddled love interest , and in a small dual role , Alice Jubert is quite alluring . Carl Crudup , James Louis Watkins , and Fred Pinkard co-star ; veteran of blaxploitation and many other films , Bob Minor , also has a small role as an angry husband . Directed quite capably by Arthur Marks , also in the directors ' chair for other blaxploitation favorites like " Detroit 9000 " , " Bucktown " , and " Friday Foster " , this is another worthy addition to his resume , as he keeps the film intriguing and moving along nicely . He also deserves mention for the visual treatment ( a deep red tint ) of the flashbacks . The music is also fun - sometimes ominous , sometimes funky , sometimes even both ! This is an entertaining little film that can be shown along with the " Blacula " films for a heck of a fun evening . Recommended .

Ordered by a judge to undergo anger management training , he ends up getting the most unorthodox and wildest instructor in NYC , Dr . Buddy Rydell ( Jack Nicholson ) . Sometimes flat , but mostly funny and entertaining comedy that works reasonably well even if it pretty much revolves around one joke . The cast is the best part , including uncredited cameos by the likes of John C . Reilly , Heather Graham ( looking very ravishing ) and Harry Dean Stanton . Also recommended if you want to see Woody Harrelson in drag . Sandler , instead of doing his usual silly and infantile routine , basically plays it straight while Nicholson genially hams it up . Final film for actress Lynne Thigpen ( who plays the judge ) . It's not a great movie but I thought it was reasonably good .
399402	1391795	84745	7.0	A spirited comic book adaptation .	Dedicated scientist Alec Holland ( Ray Wise ) is working on a revolutionary formula when sexy government agent Alice Cable ( Adrienne Barbeau ) is sent to watch over him . When arrogant megalomaniac Arcane ( Louis Jourdan ) and his bevy of henchmen step in , poor Alec is doused with his own formula , set on fire , and runs outside to plummet into the swamp . Soon , Alec is reborn as the title character ( now played by stuntman Dick Durock ) . Still in love with Barbeau , he sets out to rescue her from the bad guys ( and she needs a lot of rescuing throughout ) and takes them on . " Swamp Thing " , an adaptation of the cult DC comic , may very well be cheesy stuff , but it's still very likable entertainment . Key to its success is that it's got a lot of heart to go with its goofier moments . The relationship between Alec and Alice is handled very sensitively . However , that's not to say that writer / director Wes Craven ever takes the whole thing too seriously . It also has plenty of very amusing moments . ( For one thing , young Reggie Batts as Jude displays a nice aptitude for deadpan delivery of his lines . ) The monster suits - both Swamp Thing himself and the abomination that Arcane turns into - are a real hoot to look at . On-location filming in South Carolina really helps ; the local atmosphere is very potent . Craven even goes so far as to use comic book style scene transitions , including frequent " wipes " . Harry Manfredini supplies the music score , which sounds awfully close to his compositions for the " Friday the 13th " series at times . It all adds up to a good time . Both Wise and Barbeau are very sincere and very appealing . David Hess , " Krug " in Craven's " The Last House on the Left " , is a gas as Arcane's headband-wearing primary goon , as is Nicholas Worth as the bumbling Bruno . Durock does a fine job of acting under his makeup and suit . But Jourdan is definitely the most fun with his flamboyant portrayal of the villainous Arcane . " Swamp Thing " may not be one of the most notable pictures of Craven's career , but it shouldn't be forgotten , either . It may be lighter in tone than the horror pictures that he has given us , but that's part of its charm . Trivia note : the cut on the original DVD was in actuality the European cut of the film , featuring topless shots of not just Barbeau but some bit players as well . It got pulled from the market , to be replaced by a true PG cut on DVD years later .
399075	1391795	38387	7.0	Decent B picture with good work by Rondo Hatton .	The distinctively featured character star Rondo Hatton - his face disfigured by the disease acromegaly - gets a starring role as a revenge-crazed murderer dubbed " The Creeper " by the press . Once a handsome if hot-tempered football star by the name of Hal Moffat , a lab accident happened to mar his appearance . Now he's out to strike back at those he blames for his situation , while forming a tender friendship with a blind girl , Helen Paige ( the wonderfully beautiful Jane Adams ) , who is therefore not bound by any fear of his appearance . Were it not for Hattons ' presence ( sadly , this was his last picture ) , this would still be watchable but pretty forgettable . The plot is pretty standard . Supporting performances are acceptable , and the music has a familiar ring to it . There are also points , such as the gin rummy sequence , where the picture ought not to be taken too seriously . It's well paced ( running just under an hour long ) and reasonably entertaining , but Hattons ' poignant presence makes it something different . This is no one-dimensionally evil boogeyman , but a man blinded by the same temper that afflicted him in better days . One can get the sense of the kind and sensitive person that Hatton was . While it may have been unfortunate that the movie business was too quick to exploit Hattons ' appearance , there's no doubt that he made his mark in cinema . People continue to remember him today , right down to the naming of an award - marking achievement in horror research - after him . Rest in peace , Rondo Hatton .
398835	1391795	281686	8.0	Fabulous and original ; inspired lunacy .	After trading places with an Elvis impersonator 20 years ago , the King himself ( Bruce Campbell ) is a bitter and lonely old man living out his life in a rural East Texas nursing home . His confidante is an elderly African-American ( Ossie Davis ) who genuinely believes himself to be JFK . Together they learn that one of the lesser-known Egyptian mummies is prowling the hallways of their nursing home at night and sucking the souls out of their fellow patients . This film never takes itself seriously and well it shouldn't . Enjoyably silly - - it's far , far out premise is handled just right by the film-makers , who turn their film into what could promise to be a memorable cult item . I dare say , this amusing blend of horror and comedy is one of the best things that I've seen lately . I need to see these kinds of films sometimes - they help to shake me out of a certain seen-it-all complacency . Campbell and Davis offer incredible , right-on-the-money performances and the script offers some genuine laugh-out-loud moments . I had fun watching it and I will recommend it to others .
399581	1391795	75930	8.0	Another highly original piece of work from Larry Cohen .	Deeply religious police detective Peter Nicholas ( Tony Lo Bianco ) investigates bizarre incidents in which seemingly normal people embark on violent rampages , after which they always make the same dying confession of " God told me to " . The investigation leads Nicholas on an increasingly odd journey , not only towards probing the mystery , but learning something about himself . Similar to Alfred Soles ' much-acclaimed shocker " Alice , Sweet Alice " in its heavy accent on Catholic imagery , I can certainly say that any Larry Cohen film is going to be an entertaining , intriguing , thought-provoking film no matter what its flaws may be . I haven't seen anything quite like " God Told Me To " , and don't expect I will again . Not limiting itself to any one genre , whether it be cop drama , science-fiction , or thriller , the film maintains a suitably ominous mood , helped considerably by Frank Cordell's eerie music . The excellent cast was a big asset , with Sandy Dennis and Sylvia Sidney contributing standout moments , although Lo Bianco does a respectable job in the lead . Other familiar faces like Mike Kellin , Richard Lynch ( whose two scenes are a fantastic study in stylish , surreal strangeness ) , Deborah Raffin , Al Fann , and Cohen film regular James Dixon can be seen , with the late , enigmatic , eccentric comedian Andy Kaufman in a rare dramatic turn as an NYC cop . I definitely enjoy this film , and I can genuinely say that I won't be likely to forget it . Worth catching , not just for a Cohen fan like myself , but anyone looking for something very atmospheric ( Cohen once again infuses a movie with great NYC flavor ) and strikingly offbeat .
398567	1391795	120484	8.0	Premium-Quality H2O .	Bobby Boucher ( Adam Sandler ) is a slow-witted mama's boy who loves his work : he's the waterboy for a college football team . After taking tons of abuse from the players , he is fired by the coach ( Jerry Reed ) , and he ends up connecting with Coach Klein ( Henry Winkler ) who discovers Bobby's hidden talent : if you get Bobby mad enough , he can run and tackle like nobody's business . I don't mind saying this : this movie may be silly , but it's hard to resist . I think it's genuinely likeable and funny ; Kathy Bates ( as Bobby's mama ) and Winkler are right-on-target , and Fairuza Balk ( as the bad-girl love interest , Vicki ) is definitely sexy . Also : Sandler's one-time Saturday Night Live colleague Rob Schneider has a recurring cameo that falls into the stupid-but-hilarious category . I do have to say that doesn't really sound like a Cajun accent that Sandler is doing , just a funny voice . And I think anybody who can figure out what Farmer Fran ( Blake Clark ) is saying most of the time deserves some sort of prize ! I will give it !
399029	1391795	95379	8.0	Grim and grisly grocery store slaughter .	The staff of a grocery store , on the night that they're told that they will soon have to find new jobs , are lined up for slaughter by a nasty and most sadistic maniac , in this very enjoyable late entry in the slasher film cycle . Director Scott Spiegel goes a little overboard in the early going with his crazy ideas of where to place the camera , but eventually settles down and crafts a fine and entertaining film of its kind . He stages his many stalking and slashing sequences with considerable flair ; the K . N . B . group , in one of their earlier gigs , supply him with some eye-popping splatter . It's pretty good for a low budget flick . Suffice it to say that our killer here really makes excellent use of all the tools at hand . The grocery store makes for a rather effective setting . Decent pacing , plenty of darker-than-dark humor ( it was a real kick seeing a guy get beat down by a severed head ! ) , spooky music , a good final act , and a downer of a finish add to the surprising effectiveness of this little picture . The acting from the likable cast is variable ; Dan Hicks is an undeniable standout as Bill , although it's really cool to see director Sam Raimi and his actor brother Ted among the assorted victims . Very brief cameos by the likes of Bruce Campbell and Alvy Moore certainly don't hurt . The cute Renee Estevez ( " Sleepaway Camp II : Unhappy Campers " ) is an appealing presence for the duration of her role . Concocted by genre veteran Spiegel along with future film producer Lawrence Bender ( whose noteworthy credits include his association with Quentin Tarantino ) , this is a real fun hoot of a slasher film certain to appeal to fans of the genre .
399721	1391795	95444	8.0	Instant cult stuff .	Inventive , silly-as-can-be B movie that has simple , no-brainer fun with a ridiculous premise . Nasty alien beings that look like clowns arrive in the woods outside a small town . They have a variety of ingenious methods of disposing of their dumber-than-dumb human victims ( popcorn guns , anyone ? ) . Amiable goofball Mike ( Grant Cramer ) is an unlikely hero who teams up with his sweet girlfriend Debbies ' ( Suzanne Snyder ) policeman ex-boyfriend Dave ( John Allen Nelson ) to save the day . Of course , that's not to let out Mikes ' even goofier buddies the Terenzi brothers ( Peter Licassi and Michael Siegel ) who use an ice cream truck to pick up girls . The Chiodo brothers ( creators of effects for movies such as " Critters " ) hit upon as many circus-related gimmicks as they can . What other movie is going to give you a death by pies-to-the-face ? This movie is such spirited and tongue-in-cheek stuff that it's hard to resist . Genuinely gnarly looking clowns , excellent visual design , an efficient pace , and great gags add to the mix . And let's not forget a delightful title tune by The Dickies . Even in light of enjoyable performances by the leads , the show is stolen by the too briefly seen Royal Dano in a scenery-chewing part as an ill-fated farmer , and the great John Vernon who delivers his lines in a hilarious way . One fine moment has his line " you're not gonna make a dummy out of me " coming back to haunt him . While this is inevitably just going to come off as stupid to some viewers , I see it as a fun and easygoing kind of stupid . I have a good time watching it . Look for comedian Christopher Titus in a small part .
399044	1391795	72285	8.0	A compelling saga of revenge .	Madeleine ( Christina Lindberg ) is rendered mute after a horrible childhood rape . 15 years later , her life takes a new turn for the worse when , after missing a bus , she accepts a ride from Tony ( Heinz Hopf ) , who unsurprisingly turns out to be a real monster , getting her hooked on heroin and forcing her into working as a prostitute . Her spirit - she badly scratches a customers ' face - enrages Tony to the point where he gouges out her eye as punishment , obliging her to wear a patch from that point on . Madeline eventually can take no more . Targeting both her kinky customers ( including one lesbian ) and her boss , she uses her down time to plan revenge , receiving lessons in firearms , driving , and martial arts . She then goes about seeking retribution for everything that she has suffered . Although heavily exploitative - the full-length cut has violence aplenty and some especially graphic sex shot in close-up , this film has its arty and expressive side to it as well . It's often just as quiet as its main character , opting for a slow - very slow - and steady approach ( even the final action scenes are shot this way ) . However , its sense of grim inevitability and somber mood are quite affecting , and Madeleine is quite sympathetic and appealing as played by Lindberg . The incredibly winsome performer accomplishes just as much with facial expressions alone as she could with dialog . There are , in addition , shots from Madeleines ' P . O . V . to allow us to see through her eye ( s ) , and experience things from her perspective . We truly get a sense of a life irreparably shattered in " Thriller : A Cruel Picture " . Although sticking with it may require patience on the part of some viewers , it does offer its rewards .
398783	1391795	74156	8.0	" Two cops , wishing me luck . . . I'm doomed . "	Veteran director John Carpenter created a great , classic B thriller with this witty , stylish little piece - although it went virtually unnoticed at the time of its release , taking a while to develop a " cult " reputation . A small group of cops , secretaries and convicts are forced to band together in order to protect themselves from a street gang which has vowed to destroy them no matter what the cost . Confined to a single location - an isolated , nearly empty police station - they are attacked repeatedly throughout the night , with little to no chance of any cavalry riding to their rescue . Acknowledged as a modern , urban reworking of the 1959 Howard Hawks western " Rio Bravo " ( Carpenter even edited the picture himself , using the pseudonym ' John T . Chance ' , which was John Waynes ' character name in that movie ) , Carpenter creates a classic " Hawksian " woman in Laurie Zimmer's deliberately tough-as-nails and deadpan Leigh . He also gives great roles to two under-appreciated actors , Austin Stoker and Darwin Joston , as , respectively , the ambitious and practical Lieutenant Ethan Bishop and the cheerfully enigmatic Napoleon Wilson . It's a shame these actors never became more " mainstream " , as they delivered captivating , career-high performances here ( sadly , Joston has since passed on ) . Carpenter proves here , as he did so impressively in the early years of his career , that a film-maker does not need a great big budget to deliver potent thrills that really grab a viewer's attention . This is a picture that moves well , has some great dialog , and has some impressive atmosphere . It's fast , furious , and never boring . ( It must set some sort of record for the most squibs ever used in a low-budget picture . ) What really puts it over is one of his most memorable music scores ever , haunting and ominous - in my own opinion , just as good as the classic " Halloween " theme if not as commonly heard . Also included in the cast are future " Halloween " sheriff Charles Cyphers , in the first of six projects that he did with Carpenter , Nancy Loomis from " Halloween " and " The Fog " , former boxer Tony Burton - better known as the corner-man ' Duke ' from the entire " Rocky " series , Kim Richards from the " Witch Mountain " movies ( interesting that Carpenter would then work with Kim's sister Kyle in " Halloween " ! ) , veteran actor Henry Brandon , and an actor named Alan Koss , who any fan of ' Cheers ' will recognize as one of that series ' prominent background barflies . Beginning her association with Carpenter here , Debra Hill worked on this picture as the script supervisor and assistant editor , with Carpenter's longtime associate Tommy Lee Wallace working behind the scenes as well . If you are a fan of Carpenter , and actually have yet to see the original " Assault on Precinct 13 " , I advise you not to pass it up . It's simply , in my own humble opinion , one of the best things that he's ever done . Only " Halloween " and " The Thing " rank even higher in my books .
398800	1391795	1251206	8.0	I've always enjoyed this particular Stephen King short story .	So to see it come to life is especially fun . William Hurt plays Jason Renshaw , a coldly efficient hit man who bumps off a toy company CEO in the opening minutes . Shortly after arriving back at his own apartment , he receives an unexpected package : an assortment of toy soldiers , weapons , and helicopters . As one might expect , these are no ordinary toys , and they wage war on the hit man . Hurt delivers a game performance in this entertaining debut episode of the ' Nightmares and Dreamscapes ' mini-series . Brian Henson ( son of legendary entertainer Jim H . ) directs with efficiency ; the episode moves along quite well . It has some good suspense and the special effects are quite good . The story doesn't waste any time trying to explain the far-fetched premise , it merely goes straight to the action . Also worth noting is an almost complete lack of dialog ; here the actions really do speak louder than the words . Jeff Beals ' music was another fine asset . Bruce Spence ( the Gyro Captain from two of the " Mad Max " pictures ) and the beautiful Mia Sara ( Sloane in the 80's favorite " Ferris Bueller's Day Off " ) also appear . The teleplay is by another second-generation talent , Richard Christian Matheson . This was a good way to kick off the mini-series .
399220	1391795	91836	8.0	An enjoyably outrageous W . I . P . parody .	Unlucky Jennifer ( Linda Carol ) is busted after assisting her boyfriend in an armed robbery , and sent to Pridemore , a juvenile detention facility . The usual sleazy shenanigans ensue , including the struggle against the obese and flamboyant matron ( Pat Ast , a delight in a deliberately over-the-top performance ) and the uptight warden ( an enjoyable but under-utilized Sybil Danning ) . Writer / director Tom DeSimone had already had the films " Prison Girls " and " The Concrete Jungle " under his belt , so his attempt to send up the genre is especially noteworthy . Everything is exaggerated for comedic effect , with Carol necessarily playing her part straight so that there will be at least some sympathy for her character . But the usual clichés get lampooned effectively , and it's a nicely tawdry serving of T & A and sleaze . Some of the biggest criticisms arise out of the casting of tough-as-nails rocker Wendy O . Williams as a teenager , when she was already well into her thirties , but it fits into the whole irreverent approach to the material . It's never less than a fun , entertaining ride that offers a great climax and plenty of rock songs to underscore the action . It's appreciable that a number of the girls are lookers ; it makes them so much fun to watch . I found it rousing and had a high old time hoping that those nasty villains would get what they had coming . It's 94 minutes of straight-up lowbrow B-movie entertainment . I had a blast watching it .
398713	1391795	93870	8.0	" Dead or alive , you're coming with me . "	In the ultra-violent Detroit of the near future , nice-guy cop Alex Murphy ( Peter Weller ) is savagely executed by mean , brutal thugs . His body is used then to create a cyborg ( part man , part machine ) that is intended to be the ultimate law enforcement officer . The only problem is , he still retains his human memories and becomes consumed with striking back at the men who killed him . I call this the ultimate in visceral entertainment . Although it's not necessarily a stupid movie , you don't have to think about it , you can just enjoy it . It feels rather cathartic for me to watch such a repellent variety of worthless scum get their just desserts . It's hard-hitting , intense , and incredibly violent . It's also slick , well cast , and well acted . I like it right down to the music score by Basil Poledouris ( I can still hear that theme in my head ) . And veteran effects master Rob Bottin did a great job of supervising the creation and design of RoboCop . The appearance is impressive ( and I'm sure it must have a real pain for star Weller , getting in and out of that costume ) . But don't forget the stop-motion animation contribution by Phil Tippett . ' ED-209 ' is a good creation , too . A must for fans of macho science-fiction / action thrillers .
399130	1391795	80707	8.0	A nicely sleazy and sordid vigilante picture .	A memorably tough , nasty , and supremely gritty NYC vigilante action favorite obviously patterned after " Death Wish " , this flick stars Robert Ginty as John Eastland , Vietnam veteran working with his fellow former soldier Michael Jefferson ( Steve James ) in a market . Michael doesn't last long before he is targeted by gang members who attack him and paralyze him for life . This motivates John to do something about the level of crime in The City . He's not content , however , to stop with the gang members . He wages a full-scale war against the criminal element , while Detective James Dalton ( Christopher George ) is on his trail . This film really wastes no time . It starts with some very well-staged and hellish Vietnam scenes , the highlight of which is a brutal decapitation ( Tom Burman and Stan Winston supply the makeup effects ) . Writer / director James Glickenhaus compensates for a lack of originality by infusing his film with a relentless seediness and memorable set pieces . One of the absolute best moments has a mafioso getting fed into a meat grinder . A creepy sequence has John going after a " chicken pimp " whose primary business is supplying depraved johns with underage boys . But in the tradition of vigilante leads such as Charles Bronson's Paul Kersey in " Death Wish " , John will always turn up to punish criminal scum in the most visceral manner possible . Excellent location shooting ( as well as some great overhead shots of The City ) is a big plus , as well as some effectively melancholy songs on the soundtrack . Ginty is fine in the lead , with the ever engaging George a good choice for the role of the detective ; Samantha Eggar has a relatively minor role as an emerging love interest for George . The always charismatic James is fun to watch in his brief screen time , with some familiar faces such as Tony DiBenedetto , Dennis Boutsikaris , George Cheung , Irwin Keyes , and Tom Everett in bit parts . " The Exterminator " comes as a strong recommendation for fans of exploitation and action .
399089	1391795	80661	8.0	A career highlight for Brian De Palma .	Psychotic transsexual Bobbi murders the patient ( Angie Dickinson ) of a prominent doctor ( Michael Caine ) and then pursues the high-priced prostitute ( Nancy Allen ) who caught a glimpse of Bobbi in the elevator . Liz ( Allen ) comes under suspicion of the crime and teams up with the patient's son ( Keith Gordon ) to catch the killer . It can be summed up in a couple of words : it's very sexy ( Dickinson and Allen look great ) , it's very bloody - with the kind of gore usually reserved for splatter movies , and boy is it well crafted . Writer / director De Palma's script is OK but it really takes a backseat to the man's film-making abilities . It is highly successful on a visceral level and I actually get involved / interested with these characters . I can notice the standard De Palma homages to / ripoffs of Hitchcock - at least from one of the Master's pictures . And to top it all off , it has a professional and believable cast . This was De Palma's third movie with ex-wife Nancy Allen ( after " Carrie " and " Home Movies " . ) By the way , dancer-turned-actress Rachel Ticotin was one of the production assistants . There's a bit of trivia for you . I wouldn't think a thriller could be classy and bloody at the same time but this picture pulls it off . One of the best things about it is a typically striking Pino Donaggio music score .
399433	1391795	98320	8.0	" Any last words ? " " Yeah . . . no more Mr . nice guy . "	Innovative Wes Craven horror thriller in which football jock Jonathan Parker ( Peter Berg ) discovers his own psychic link to barbaric mass murderer Horace Pinker ( Mitch Pileggi ) , a devil worshiper who enters homes under the cover of his occupation , a TV repairman . When Pinker is captured and executed , things actually take a turn for the worse when it is revealed that he can now move from body to body . Unfairly dismissed by Leonard Maltin as a " misbegotten farrago " , this film has a decent sense of humor and an ingenious climax where killer and hero run amok through TV land . The film-makers have fun with their gimmick , delivering a movie that is hip , clever and stylish ( even satiric ) , if a little long . The cast performs well , with special kudos for Pileggi for his intensity and physical presence . Look for cameos by such diverse faces as guitarist Kane Roberts , drug guru Dr . Timothy Leary , and even " Nightmare on Elm Street " heroine Heather Langenkamp as a victim . Craven's children have bit parts , and the director himself appears as a neighbor at the film's conclusion . I enjoyed the hard rock songs , especially Megadeth's cover of Alice Cooper's " No More Mr . Nice Guy " . The plot device of a homicidal killer being able to possess human victims at will may not be original , but in a film as solidly entertaining as this one , it's not a major quibble .
398594	1391795	78405	8.0	Not entirely what I expected , but still pretty good stuff .	A ski-mask wearing , barbaric psychopath butchers the lovely young ladies in an L . A . apartment building utilizing the various implements to be found in his trusty toolbox . Now , this unquestionably trashy , nasty , and flashy slasher flick doesn't exactly end there . If you think that's all the plot that the movie has , think again . After a couple of murders are out of the way , the killer kidnaps an adorable teenager ( Pamelyn Ferdin ) , intending for her to replace the daughter that he lost in a car crash . The incredibly extended sequence where he is revealed ( most people will probably be able to figure out who he is before they even watch this ) and soothes the bound and gagged girl turns out to be rather heartfelt , completely taking the movie out of slasher flick territory . It's a jarring but , I have to say , interesting turn of events . It ultimately resolves itself in a fascinatingly ugly , melodramatic and disturbing finish . Veteran actor Cameron Mitchell , who after a very prestigious start to his career , would start to turn up in more and more low-budget junk as his career went on , is a marvelously scuzzy lead . Ferdin projects the appropriate amount of childhood innocence and naiveté , while other youthful actors from the period , Wesley Eure ( ' Land of the Lost ' ) and Nicholas Beauvy ( " The Cowboys " ) play good friends , one with a deadly secret ; veteran Aneta Corsaut ( ' The Andy Griffith Show ' , " The Blob " ' 58 ) and Tim Donnelly as one hell of an incompetent detective round out the cast . The film has a wonderfully disgusting opening act , as the blood is piled on and the scantily clad victims scream their hearts out . Most unusual is that , despite the beautiful eeriness of George Deatons ' music score , what actually accompanies these great murder set pieces are a couple of slow and soft country songs ! ( The killer , obviously a music lover himself , is often heard humming along ! ) The best moment occurs when Marianne Walter , a . k . a . 80's porn actress Kelly Nichols , is seen pleasuring herself in a bubble bath before the toolbox murderer comes calling . Overall , it's a fetid piece of celluloid junk that hits just the right spot , a raw and depraved vintage example of prime 1970's exploitation horror fare .
399632	1391795	416315	8.0	Good work by this talented film-making team .	Despite having the familiar horror movie element of youngsters stranded in a remote rural setting and being preyed upon by a homicidal lunatic , the Ozzie import " Wolf Creek " is supposed to be based on real events . Three travelers - Brit girls Liz ( Cassandra Magrath ) and Krista ( Kestie Morassi ) and Ozzie stud Ben ( Nathan Phillips ) have car trouble after exploring a tourist attraction ( an enormous crater caused by a meteor landing ) and run into jovial Outback resident Mick ( John Jarratt ) . However , since this is a horror thriller , it's a safe bet that Mick will be revealed to something more than just some lovable Outback-dwelling bloke . " Wolf Creek " is a slow-moving movie at first , taking its time to hit its stride , although , it's true , this does help us to get to know these characters more and therefore genuinely reel at the horrible tortures that they endure . The film , naturally enough , really kicks into gear once Mick makes his appearance . It's a tour de force performance by Jarratt , and hopefully we can see more of him in the years to come . I know that this had been said before ( probably many times ) , but this character truly does seem like " Crocodile " Dundee if he had the personality of , say , Freddy Krueger , or Leatherface , for that matter . Once the film starts to delve into its horror content , it becomes a pretty harrowing , intense , and sadistic story . I found it very easy to sympathize with these characters , especially since they are portrayed as likable , down-to-earth kids and not the troupe of sex-obsessed morons that you would see in many an American slasher picture . The unrated cut that I watched has some gruesome set pieces that really bring it home ( like other films of its kind , it's safe to say this movie is not for everybody ) . Despite the " grainy " , low-budget nature of the film , it has one ace of a cinematographer , Will Gibson , who captures on high definition video some absolutely gorgeous shots of the Australian countryside . It's as much fun to look at as it is to watch ( production designer Robert Webb also does a decent job at creating Mick's back-of-the-beyond lair ) . The acting , directing , script ( by the director , Greg McLean , also the producer ) , and music are all impressive . It's darn good entertainment of its kind .
399677	1391795	94056	8.0	Morgan Freeman really makes this a must-see .	The late Christopher Reeve stars as Jonathan Fisher , an investigative reporter who tries to tackle the story of a pimp's day-to-day life . Caving in to the pressure of an impending deadline , he comes up with a fictional story . The unfortunate side effect of this fabrication is that the assistant district attorney ( Jay Patterson ) is convinced that he's telling the story of a real-life pimp , " Fast Black " ( Morgan Freeman , in his breakout , Academy Award-nominated performance ) , who's being prosecuted for murder . The Cannon Group made its fair share of entertaining thrillers , and action , horror , and sci-fi movies during the 1980's , but this has to stand as one of their more interesting efforts . It's a pretty good story ( written by David Freeman ) , consistently entertaining and easy to watch . Ultimately , it does a good job of portraying a seamy side of life , while contrasting that with the kind of high society that wouldn't ordinarily connect with it . And the fact that Fisher is not so different from " Fast Black " certainly comes across ; the movie does have something to say about the way that certain types in the news business conduct themselves , and the potential repercussions of their actions . I think that Reeve does a decent enough job in the lead , although it's definitely true that his co-stars fare much better . Kathy Baker is wonderfully appealing ( and sexy ) as Punchy , one of " Fast Black " ' s girls ; she shines in all of her scenes , especially when she's relating to Fisher the comedic account of her first ever trick . But Freeman emerges as the real star of the movie . In a role far removed from the calm , authoritative , and wise persona that has been his stock in trade in the years since , he shows his true range , portraying a cunning , ruthless and also intelligent criminal who can come off as genial and welcoming and then turn on a dime and reveal the ugly side lying underneath the smooth exterior . Mimi Rogers , Andre Gregory , Anna Maria Horsford , and Erik King co-star , with each of them delivering good performances as well . " Street Smart " is a solid movie with a good premise and presentation , enjoyable soundtrack , and some mighty fine moments , especially one involving Freeman , Baker , and a pair of scissors .
399809	1391795	37761	8.0	Laird Cregar makes this a must-see .	Ill-fated film star of the 1940's , Laird Cregar , gives an intense , committed , and sympathetic performance in this turn-of-the-century period piece about talented London composer George Harvey Bone ( Cregar ) , who suffers blackouts after which he has no memory of what may have happened . Although proved innocent of one murder committed at the beginning of the film , he turns out to have murderous impulses after all , as he begins to lash out at those in his life . Based on the novel by Patrick Hamilton , " Hangover Square " ( the title refers to an address ) is a meticulously made film with an engrossing story , well directed by John Brahm . As photographed by Joseph LaShelle , it looks great . The particularly striking sequences are the bonfire sequence and the final fire at the concert hall . Bernard Herrmann once again proves his worth by composing not only the score , but the moody and beautiful concerto as well . The imposing Cregar , sporting an affecting look of sadness throughout , delivers a wonderful performance as the increasingly obsessed Bone , who in his most sober moments is heartbreaking in his fear of losing control . It's a perfect swan song for the actor , who didn't even get to see the film hit theaters , passing away just months earlier - at the way-too-young age of 28 - most likely suffering from the effects of a crash diet that caused him to lose approximately 100 pounds . That adds an even greater sense of tragedy to the film itself . Linda Darnell offers a juicy supporting performance as the scheming and selfish singer who only likes Bone for what he can do for her ; George Sanders is solid as a doctor working for Scotland Yard , and Faye Marlowe is very appealing as the loyal friend who's quite rightly concerned about Bones ' dilemma . It's an entertaining , poignant melodrama / thriller ( I would not call it horror , even if it might be promoted as such ) that really works as well as it does thanks to the efforts of its leading man .
399654	1391795	104815	8.0	A smashing debut for Robert Rodriguez . . .	In director Rodriguez's first feature-length movie , Carlos Gallardo plays a " mariachi " , or singing guitar player , who is mistaken for a vengeful criminal in a small Mexico town and is chased around by thugs who are supposed to eliminate the other guy . The first film in the " El Mariachi " trilogy shows that an enormous budget is not always necessary in order to create decent entertainment . Made for a sum of only about $7 , 000 , the film was financed by the proceeds the director made from his time spent in a research facility . Obviously a labor of love , and made with genuine talent , the film is often incredibly violent , but very potent . The cast gives no indication of being amateurs ; they are all very good . Rodriguez , as he has done with his other pictures , handled several duties , and star Gallardo worked behind the scenes as well . The music , composed by several people , was enjoyable and really helped to set the mood at times . Followed by " Desperado " ( 1995 ) and " Once Upon a Time in Mexico " ( 2003 ) .
399862	1391795	74806	8.0	What's in the cellar ? ! ?	Very , very low-key drama / mystery in which a very poised and believable young Jodie Foster plays Rynn , who seems to live all alone in a nice home in a peaceful little town . In addition to fending off the advances of her disgusting neighbor Frank Hallet ( Martin Sheen ) she has to go about keeping a very big secret . This is a well acted and well told story , with decent twists and turns . It's watchable throughout . The intriguing little plot was concocted by Laird Koenig , first as a novel , then adapted by Koenig for the screen . What impressed me was that even when the revelation is made ( sooner than I expected , actually ) , there's still no need to show the audience anything . The dialog is good enough to tell us all we need to know . The music is by Christian Gaubert , and a composition by Frederic Chopin is prominently featured . It's all very good , and is supervised by co-star Mort Shuman , who plays the friendly policeman Mr . Miglioritti . In addition to its mystery , the whole idea of Rynn struggling to live a life of complete self-reliance but realizing that it is important to be with people that care about you is very well realized . It's a nice little story with a memorable denouement . It definitely does deserve to be better known .
399249	1391795	113858	8.0	Pretty good as B movies go .	The crashing of an alien spaceship in a forest results in enormous mosquitoes after the tiny blood suckers feast on the alien corpses . After the deadly creatures lay waste to a multitude of locals , a disparate group of survivors hooks up , realizing that they will have to take care of the problem themselves . Director Gary Jones and crew aren't exactly out to re-invent the wheel here . They're just delivering a humorous and low , low budget 90's spin on the giant insect classics of the 50's , and clearly having fun doing it . It delivers some welcome in-jokes , with the most noteworthy coming as Gunnar Hansen - none other than Leatherface of " Texas Chain Saw Massacre " fame - hefts a chain saw and proclaims " I haven't held one of these for 20 years . Feels good . " There are even shades of " Night of the Living Dead " and " Alien " , which made it especially fun for a genre fan like me . The pacing was very effective ; the movie does not waste time and keeps the tension going once it kicks into gear . The attack scenes are particularly , enjoyably brutal , as the mosquitoes jab their proboscis into eyeballs and posteriors . The special effects are agreeable enough - both the mosquitoes themselves and their desiccated victims . The engaging no-name cast fills out their roles well , and the movie in general is straightforward , unpretentious genre fare made with a certain amount of zeal . I had a good time watching it .
399248	1391795	49646	8.0	Good fun .	The introduction of Nigel Kneales ' Prof . Quatermass character to the screen results in this well done sci-fi / horror entry in which a spaceship returns to Earth with only one survivor out of three astronauts . Victor Carroon ( Richard Wordsworth ) , the only one left , is clearly not all right , however . Infested by an alien being , he's slowly mutating into a monster with quick reproductive capabilities . Prof . Quatermass ( Brian Donlevy ) must work with the London police to track him down when he escapes . It's very well directed by Val Guest , the man behind other genre fare such as " The Abominable Snowman " and " The Day the Earth Caught Fire " . It's rather imaginative in terms of its alien menace , and is full of tension . It hits the ground running and unfolds at a consistent pace , and maintains a genuinely creepy feeling , helped in no small part by the incredible performance of Wordsworth . The makeup effects are effective as well . A smart , efficient script and solid performances are major assets . Donlevy and Jack Warner work well together as the heroes with differing viewpoints and ways of doing things . David King-Wood and Harold Lang are excellent in supporting roles and Thora Hird has a comedic , scene-stealing role late in the picture . Both intelligent and fun at the same time , " The Quatermass Xperiment " emerges as a superb entry in the sci-fi / horror boom of the 1950's . It would lead to further cinematic Quatermass adventures that are also well worth checking out .
399623	1391795	89034	8.0	An excellent throwback to the Gothic horror movies of decades past .	Dr . Thomas Rock ( Timothy Dalton ) needs cadavers for medical study , and he prefers not to worry too much about morals and ethics ; whatever the locals can obtain for him , he accepts . ( The deciding factor is that the " fresher " the bodies , the better . ) Scurrilous , creepy barflies Fallon ( Jonathan Pryce ) and Broom ( Stephen Rea ) get wind of this and figure to profit substantially . The problem is , these two don't hesitate to resort to outright murder to obtain bodies . As news of this breaks to the community , it threatens to destroy everything that Dr . Rock has worked for . The story of real-life Victorian era fiends William Burke and William Hare has also been fodder for other film adaptations ; one such example is the 1945 Val Lewton thriller " The Body Snatcher " , starring Boris Karloff . The script , by Dylan Thomas , was completed back in the 1950's , yet remained unfilmed until the mid-80's , when old-style Gothic horror movies were no longer in vogue . Although American-produced ( comedy legend Mel Brooks , who is in actuality a big fan of old horror movies , presents it through his company ) , the very British feel of this movie is palpable . Old pro and Hammer Studios horror veteran Freddie Francis , with a long and distinguished career as both a director and cinematographer , guides this material with a very capable eye for detail and the visuals of this movie are , quite simply , extraordinarily stylish . The predominant color scheme of reds and browns gives it a great look ; the re-creation of the time and place is equally strong . John Morris's score is magnificent and the pace is steady , with some striking images and sequences . The top-notch British cast is compulsively watchable . Dalton has some wonderfully florid dialog to deliver and his performance is intense . Pryce is perhaps the standout of the movie as the morally bankrupt Fallon , who as accomplice Broom eventually points out , seems to be enjoying the act of murder too much . Both he and Rea make for a marvelous pair of scuzzy and greedy cretins . Julian Sands , Twiggy , Lewis Fiander , Phyllis Logan , Patrick Stewart , and Sian Phillips round out the cast . The ethical dilemma posed here is interesting enough to provide some food for thought . Just what should be permissible in the name of study and progress ? The other intriguing aspect of this story is the fact that Dr . Rock actually cares more for the impoverished and destitute people of his city than his colleagues . ( The film-makers spare us nothing in depicting poverty on film . ) The end result is that although we can admire Dr . Rock to a certain extent , ultimately his good intentions cannot justify his actions , although his own philosophy is that the ends always justify the means . An unjustly overlooked and fine horror film , " The Doctor and the Devils " was a real change of pace in a decade known more for its excesses . It's worth checking out .
398575	1391795	40416	8.0	Well Done .	40's version of Shakespeare's classic has Laurence Olivier as the " melancholy Dane " , the prince of Denmark whose father has recently died and whose mother has re-married . . . to his father's brother , a man whom Hamlet cannot stand . Eventually the truth behind his father's death emerges , and Hamlet pretends to have lost his mind while formulating a revenge plan . I'm not really a fan of Shakespeare or the theatre , but I have to be objective and admit that this is a film of distinction , and has the utmost respect for the source material . Cast is certainly great . The night scenes are creepy , and the duelling scene is not bad . I do miss the presence of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern , who are absent from this version . . . they provided welcome comedy relief in the play . Peter Cushing , in his pre-Hammer horror days , is funny in the role of the iffeminate Osric . Good enough to rate an , I think . It is pretty long , though .
398671	1391795	53677	8.0	Very entertaining entry in Hammers ' Dracula series .	On her way to a teaching job , Marianne Danielle ( Yvonne Monlaur ) is persuaded to spend the night at the mansion of Baroness Meinster ( Martita Hunt ) . There she finds that the Baroness's son ( David Peel ) is kept chained up . She takes pity on him , and frees him . Little does she know what a mistake she is making . Fortunately for her , the indomitable Dr . Van Helsing ( the always wonderful Peter Cushing ) arrives on the scene . . . but will he be able to save her ? This enjoyable shocker , sandwiched in between " The Horror of Dracula " and " Dracula : Prince of Darkness " , goes to show that the Count himself need not be present for the sake of a good show . The story here is interesting in its own right , and the performances are quite good . The handsome Peel makes for a charismatic bloodsucker , the striking Freda Jackson a real scene stealer as old crone housekeeper Greta , and stalwart old genre pros such as Miles Malleson and Michael Ripper are fun as usual . It's colorful , with typically fine mood and atmosphere , a superb score by Malcolm Williamson , and efficient pacing and meticulous direction by Terence Fisher ; standout scenes include a shot of Greta on top of a grave urging the victim to rise , and especially Van Helsings ' impromptu healing of a neck wound . It all leads to a nicely rousing conclusion . Another solid outing from the fine folks at Hammer Studios .
399025	1391795	84861	8.0	A choice exploitation action flick !	Basically decent " outlaw " prostitute named " Princess " ( Season Hubley ) , who answers to no-one but herself , agrees to help the cops nab a particularly lethal and monumentally slimy pimp named " Ramrod " ( the incredible Wings Hauser , who ultimately walks away with the movie ) after he molests , mutilates and murders one of her friends . As you can see , there's not an over-abundance of plot here , but this flashy and trashy B movie delivers the goods in an always entertaining way . It's a wholly visceral crime picture that pulls no punches in portraying the seamy side of life . Director Gary Sherman , breaking out of the horror mold after giving us the excellent fright features " Raw Meat " ( a . k . a . " Deathline " ) and " Dead & Buried " , immerses us deeply in this sad and sordid underworld . There's no shortage of depraved , freaky , or destitute folks to fill up the screen . Hubley plays her tough , independent , good-hearted character with a strong degree of integrity and conviction and Gary Swanson ratchets up the intensity as a determined , not-all-that-likable detective , while the supporting cast is littered with familiar faces like Pepe Serna , Beverly Todd , future MTV VJ Nina Blackwood ( as the ill-fated friend ) , Lydia Lei , Fred " Rerun " Berry ( as a sugar pimp who has the horrible misfortune to get in Ramrods ' way , and pays a big price for it ) , Grand L . Bush , Michael Ensign , Jonathan Haze , Stack Pierce , and Cheryl " Rainbeaux " Smith . But this emerges as Wings Hausers ' show all the way . The boyish-faced , curly-haired actor brings true tenacity and ferocity to the role of Ramrod . Not only that , but Wings further entertains us by growling and belting out the gritty rock theme " Neon Slime " over the opening and closing credits . A tough , hard-hitting , and potent film of its type ( yet not without a real sense of humor ) , " Vice Squad " steadily moves along to its inevitable final confrontation . Shot with typical style by ace cinematographer John Alcott , best known for his association with Stanley Kubrick , it oozes prime seedy atmosphere and menace . It's a grand old time , recommended viewing for anyone interested in the great sleazy B pictures of yesteryear .
399472	1391795	144120	8.0	" If this story were a movie , it would take three or four sequels to do it justice . "	Chucky's one-time girlfriend , Tiffany ( Jennifer Tilly ) tracks his remains down and resurrects the savage miniature psycho - only to end up the same way herself , trapped inside a doll . Together , they set out for New Jersey where Chucky's human remains were buried so that Chucky can retrieve an all-important amulet , involving two young lovers ( Katherine Heigl and Nick Stabile ) in their plans . Fourth " Child's Play " movie takes off in a new direction , opting not to truly scare the viewer and instead turning into more of a savage black comedy , with a number of good lines and dialog between Chucky and Tiffany . It actually works , and the film is pretty entertaining , with amusing supporting work by Alexis Arquette , Gordon Michael Woolvett ( T . V . ' s ' Andromeda ' ) , and John Ritter , of all people . It's bloody , nasty , fairly slick , and amusingly scripted . . . although I have to wonder why Chucky is only now recalling that ( do I have to say SPOILER here ? ) HE HAS TO HAVE THAT AMULET in order for a successful transition of his soul to a host , human or otherwise . Then again , he didn't seem to need it when transferring Tiffany's soul to a doll , did he ? The film's best line is a good in-joke for horror buffs , spoken after Ritter's character has been disposed of . Actress Janet Kidder , who has a small role , is Margot Kidder's niece .
398921	1391795	443453	8.0	An absolutely great comedy .	Sacha Baron Cohen keeps character comedy alive with this feature film vehicle for his irrepressible Kazakhstani reporter . Borat is sent to The U . S . and A . to examine its culture in the hopes of solving his own country's problems . He discovers actress Pamela Anderson through his first viewing of ' Baywatch ' , and , now obsessed with her , he travels cross country to meet her . As he travels with producer Azamat ( Ken Davitian , a great foil for the star ) , he is exposed to a wide variety of Americans , each with their own clearly defined views . It's so easy to guffaw long and hard at Cohen's flair for outrageous lowbrow humor . The fight scene is far and away the most hysterical set piece . The character of Borat is engaging and watching him stumble his way through understanding various lessons - whether he's getting coaching in humor , etiquette , or driving - is hard to resist . Cohen plays this role for all he's worth . It's also quite interesting to see a comedy that so vividly captures various prejudices and perceptions and makes them such an integral part of its presentation . It also works in the classic tradition of a foreigner struggling to come to grips with American society , in many of its variations . Borat interacts with country folk , the gay community , frat boys , and Christian churchgoers and makes these situations all rather fresh . Director Larry Charles keeps it all moving along very nicely , with a satisfying wrap-up . The documentary style approach works well , and seeing ordinary people as opposed to actors is also highly welcome . I haven't seen anything quite like this before . Unpredictable , wild , and undeniably hilarious , it's one of the best comedies that I've seen in the last several years .
398571	1391795	103064	9.0	He said he'd be back .	Once again , the machines of the future are determined to get rid of their nemesis , John Connor . This time , they send a killer cyborg back to 1991 L . A . , to kill the young John . As before , the resistance is able to send a protector back in time as well . . . Doesn't have quite the same impact as the first film , but as a no-holds-barred science-fiction / action film , it's definitely above average , with great chases , an incredible amount of gunfire , a fine cast , and some very impressive special effects . Does go on pretty long ( I watched a special edition of the film that runs over two hours and a half ) but that's a minor quibble . Once again , it's a pleasure to watch the work of a film-maker who clearly knows what he's doing . Some directors are just hacks who don't have the style or talent to bring any sort of quality to their films . . . at least James Cameron isn't like that . You also get new Arnold one-liners for your amusement . . . . and hasta la vista , baby !
399243	1391795	70295	9.0	A magical Southern fantasy .	This movie deals with characters who make a serious business of " defying the devil " , or standing up to evil in any form that it might take . One such person is John ( Hedges Capers ) , who picks up where his beloved grandpappy ( Denver Pyle ) left off . He embarks on an incredible journey full of offbeat and sometimes horrific encounters , often playing his guitar as he walks on . This was derived from a book titled " Who Fears the Devil ? " by Manly Wade Wellman , who adapted several real life folk tales that he heard . It's a highly intriguing story the likes of which I haven't quite seen on film before . It's refreshingly unpredictable from one moment to the next . It gets a lot out of its Appalachian locale ; the atmosphere is quite heavy and the settings are extremely well shot . The very colorful cast of characters are brought to life by a marvelous cast also including Severn Darden ( playing a truly interesting part ) , Harris Yulin , R . G . Armstrong , Sidney Clute , Val Avery , Percy Rodrigues , Susan Strasberg , and Sharon Henesy . Capers also composed some of the songs , as did the late , great Hoyt Axton ; these songs are spirited and infectious . The special effects are crude but tolerable , the pacing consistently slow but steady , and the movie overall rates as a uniquely strange and flavorful experience that I would say deserves its cult following . It's certainly motivated me to check out the authors ' works , which is a good thing for any adaptation .
399701	1391795	104511	9.0	When you're undead , you're family . . .	Clever , original movie from screenwriter Michael Wolk and director John Landis in which sexy French vampire Marie ( an alluring and highly appealing Anne Parillaud of " La Femme Nikita " fame ) feeds only on the scum of society . Not only that , but she always makes sure to finish her victims off so they don't become vampires themselves . However , after sinking her fangs into mob boss Sal " The Shark " Macelli ( a marvelously grandiose turn by veteran Robert Loggia ) , she fails to finish him off , and the result is uproarious , as the newly minted vampire revels in his newfound powers and ultimately turns his minions into the undead as well . Good cop Joe Gennaro ( Anthony LaPaglia , solid and likable ) , who'd been working undercover as part of Sals ' gang , tries to put a stop to things . Overlength may be the only problem with this very , very fun and engaging movie that's a lot of things rolled into one efficient package : mob movie , comedy , vampire horror , done with great style . It's full of the red stuff ( naturally ) ; it's energetic and violent and the special effects are really quite superb . Landis , who endeared himself to horror fans with his highly humorous 1981 werewolf classic , " An American Werewolf in London " , once again proves adept at balancing outright horror - delivering some great shocks - with a truly appreciable sense of humor . Landis also takes the time to occasionally slow down the action by establishing the budding relationship between Marie and Joe ; in fact , Maries ' dialog / narration and Parillauds ' performance take on a kind of poignancy . Fortunately , Landis never forgets that this is essentially a " fun " picture , and always has another great scene for us right around the corner . The stars are capably supported by a top-notch cast including David Proval , Chazz Palminteri , Don Rickles ( doing good work as Macellis ' attorney ) , Tony " Paulie Walnuts " Sirico , Luis Guzman , Angela Bassett , Leo Burmester , and Marshall Bell . Adhering to his tradition of numerous gag cameos , director Landis also dots the landscape with extremely welcome appearances by such fellow directors as Sam Raimi , Dario Argento , Michael Ritchie , and Frank Oz ( Oz's scenes as the coroner are particularly hysterical ) , as well as other fine folk as Tom Savini , Forrest J . Ackerman , and Linnea Quigley . Numerous references to vampire films of the past also make it fun - look for clips from films ranging all the way from the ' 31 " Dracula " to " Strangers on a Train " . The city of Pittsburgh makes a great setting for the film ; great wintry settings are well photographed by genre pro Mac Ahlberg . It's always a pleasure , as a horror fan , to watch a picture made by a true horror fan . It's an under-rated and over-looked picture in Landis's career .
399855	1391795	74589	9.0	Appealing combination of drama and comedy ; a real find .	American icon Henry Fonda portrays " Elegant " John Howard , an aging trucker who has had his beloved big rig " Eleanor " repossessed after a lengthy hospital stay has forced him to miss his payments . Deciding that he would like to make just one more perfect run , he breaks out of the hospital , steals back Eleanor , and hooks up with old friend Penelope Pearson ( Eileen Brennan ) , who is in need of relocating her troupe of prostitutes . Fondas ' wonderful performance is a natural anchor for a film that tugs at the heartstrings as effectively as it tickles the funny bone in the more comedic scenes . A superb cast including Robert Englund , as a reluctant young sidekick , Susan Sarandon ( who also gets co-producer credit ) , and Dub Taylor ( a delightful ham , as always , in the most blatantly comedic portion of the picture ) helps immeasurably . The ultimately life-affirming nature of the picture and the poignancy of the journey carry incredible weight ; this is a picture , that provided you get into it , you can remember long after it's over . The promise of the open road is vividly displayed here ; the countryside just looks beautiful . Set to Craig Safans ' wonderful music score , it's a remarkable picture in terms of aesthetics . It loses a little something in its final act ( the characters played by John Byner and Austin Pendleton are little more than intrusions ) , but it still maintains its good vibes thanks to the appeal of its central characters . Not at all the exploitation / drive-in schlock picture one might expect from the title ( especially its alternate title , " The Great Smokey Roadblock " ) , it's a rewarding movie experience that I can recommend without qualms .
399035	1391795	82533	9.0	" You can't tame what's meant to be wild , Doc . It ain't natural . "	The werewolf genre had been dormant for a while , to be revived quite impressively in 1981 by Joe Dante's " The Howling " and John Landis's " An American Werewolf in London " . This still stands tall as a fine horror film with many elements coming together to create one of the best films of its kind . Officially basing their script on Gary Brandner's novel , credited screenwriters John Sayles and Terrence H . Winkless came up with a plot of TV anchorwoman Karen White ( Dee Wallace , lovable as always ) , who helps the cops to nab ultra-creepy killer Eddie Quist ( Robert Picardo , soon to become a fixture in Dante's films ) , but is severely traumatized by the event . To help her come to grips with her experience , eminent psychiatrist Dr . George Waggner ( Patrick Macnee ) invites her to his experimental encounter-group community " The Colony " , located deep in the California woods . What Karen doesn't know is that the entire population is made up of werewolves - very frightening and vicious ones at that . For me , this highly entertaining fright flick continues to hold up . It's all done with lots of wit and style . It's filled with a delightful array of wolf-related in-jokes : a copy of Allen Ginsburg's " Howl " , a tin of Wolf Chili , footage taken from the 1941 werewolf classic " The Wolf Man " , and several of the main characters are named after men who directed werewolf films ( George Waggner , Terry ( Terence ) Fisher , ( Roy ) William Neill , Charles Barton , etc . ) . It's fun to take all of it in . But even with a strong and appreciable sense of humor , it works as a genuinely scary horror movie , with impressive bipedal werewolves that , unlike , past cinematic interpretations of the creatures , are much more wolf than man . Rob Bottin made a real name for himself with his eye-popping makeup effects and transformations ; Picardo's effectively drawn-out metamorphosis is an undeniable highlight . Night scenes are creepy and suspenseful , and the film delivers some good jolts as well . The cast is excellent right down the line . Dennis Dugan , Kevin McCarthy , lovely Belinda Balaski , alluring Elisabeth Brooks , James Murtaugh , Noble Willingham , Kenneth Tobey , ever affable Slim Pickens , a typically extravagant John Carradine , and Meshach Taylor all do fine supporting work . But the show is stolen by Dante regular Dick Miller ( re-using his old character name Walter Paisley once again ) as a bookstore owner and Sayles himself as a morgue attendant ; these are both wonderful cameo performances . Sayles did a fine job of putting a new spin on werewolf tales . While many past leads of werewolf films were tragic victims , the werewolves in this film rather enjoy themselves and more than anything would rather be adhering to werewolf tradition and feeding on their human counterparts . The script even takes time to gently poke fun at the various therapy crazes of the time period . Art director Robert A . Burns of " Texas Chain Saw Massacre " fame does typically impressive work , Pino Donaggio contributes another of his eerie music scores , and the film ends on a very amusing final note . Followed by six sequels .
398983	1391795	167404	10.0	" I see dead people ! "	Cole Sear ( Haley Joel Osment , in his breakthrough performance ) is a VERY troubled child who is surrounded by ghosts - actual ghosts - day in and day out . Into this mess steps acclaimed child psychiatrist Malcolm Crowe ( Bruce Willis ) who makes it his life's mission to help Cole come to terms with this existence . What else can I say but FANTASTIC ? I'm not surprised this would end up on a top 250 list . This is an intelligent , brilliantly subtle piece of work that demands more than one viewing ( for some people , anyway ) . It's spooky without resorting to special effects for its impact , and the four ( five , actually - don't forget Donnie Wahlberg's compelling and upsetting cameo ) lead performances are top-notch . Osment is particularly noteworthy , delivering quite a mature performance for a child his age . If you're like me , you'll want to watch it again just to note the clues left throughout the film that indicate what the film's ultimate surprise will be ( I wouldn't DREAM of giving it away - I'm not stupid ! ) . Writer-director M . Night Shyamalan certainly succeeded in his goal - he did create a " cultural phenomenon " that does " get under the skin " . This is the kind of film I think people would definitely remember . Worthy of a rating . ( If you like this film , I would also recommend Stir of Echoes ( starring Kevin Bacon ) , which does share some similarities in plot . )
399228	1391795	89907	10.0	Delicious blend of humor and horror .	Gas from an ancient Army canister leaks into a medical supply warehouse and a nearby cemetery and unleashes a legion of living-dead ghouls . Originally conceived as a straight sequel to George Romero's original zombie movies , then re-worked with more humor , " The Return of the Living Dead " is great entertainment for the die-hard horror fan . It has an infectious , ghoulish spirit . An interesting cast is called upon to portray a variety of characters - more than the typical garden-variety teenage morons common to the 1980's horror film . The intriguing trio of reliable veterans in the three leads - Clu Gulager , James Karen , and Don Calfa - under-rated actors , all three of them - and the amusing young troupe of actors playing the fringe-dwelling punks / victims all work well together . The late Mark Venturini - as the character " Suicide " has a funny moment where he defends his get-up ( " This isn't a costume . It's a way of life . " ) Departing from usual zombie clichés , the creatures in this movie don't awkwardly lumber along - they run , they work together , and they ambush their victims . This makes for a more threatening situation for our heroes . " The Return of the Living Dead " is pure escapism and often hysterical farce . Watch as three characters try to dispatch a troublesome " yellow man " corpse . Whacking it in the head with a pick-ax doesn't work . Sawing off its head doesn't work . Cutting the rest of the body into pieces doesn't work . It's truly funny to watch this troupe of characters try to deal with a situation that ultimately snowballs way out of control . We even get a scene where a conversation with a zombie torso takes place . Yes , the zombie actually talks . This puts another new spin on the same old zombie formula . We actually find out why the zombies are so compelled to eat human brains . My favorite zombie of the movie is the foul , dripping " Tar Man " . Played by a performer named Allan Trautman , this thing is both hideous and hilarious . He walks ( or should I say shambles ) away with all of his scenes . This stylish and funny spoof is rollicking and entertaining throughout , although it does after a while start taking itself seriously instead of keeping up the jokes . I still love it - there are truly inspired moments , and it's a worthy addition to your DVD library if you enjoy zombie pictures . All in all , it's a fun picture to watch if you've got the stomach for this sort of movie . Interestingly enough , this was the film-making debut for top science-fiction screenwriter Dan O'Bannon ( of " Alien " fame ) , although he wouldn't direct again until 1992's " The Resurrected " .
399669	1391795	21814	10.0	An all-time horror classic .	In this legendary 1931 picture , the immortal Count Dracula ( played by the equally immortal Bela Lugosi ) travels to London to lease Carfax Abbey , right next to the insane asylum run by Dr . Seward ( Herbert Bunston ) . In short order , he is haunting his new neighbors and biting the pretty young female ones on the neck . It is a pleasure to watch this horror film - it is spooky for one major reason : it has tons of atmosphere , which is further enhanced by the Philip Glass music score , newly added to the film after over 60 years . Just check out the shots where Dracula's face is in shadows and light is only falling on his eyes . Lugosi , at the peak of his career and years away from the tailspin it would ultimately take , plays the role with subtle charm and menace . Dwight Frye , as his human puppet Renfield , is also very entertaining . That look of goofy madness on Frye's face is priceless ! I often burst out laughing when he came on screen . Furthermore , a good showcase for Edward Van Sloan , as well , as the cool , calm and collected Professor Van Helsing , who is on to Dracula before anybody else in the film . If there is a weak leak in this chain of actors , I would have to say it is David Manners as John Harker - he's simply dull . Once seen , never forgotten .
398909	1391795	120660	10.0	Can you imagine not having any privacy at all ?	Will Smith plays Robert Dean , a successful Washington , D . C . attorney who is passed a tape by an old friend ( Jason Lee ) on the run ; it turns out that the tape secretly recorded a politically motivated murder and now the psychos who committed the crime start methodically ruining Dean's life in an effort to discredit him should he come forward with the evidence . Dean is ultimately forced to team up with Brill ( Gene Hackman ) , a lone-wolf operative who's helped him with some of his cases in the past . I love this movie , for one main reason : Once it gets going , it moves a mile a minute , with truly breathtaking chase scenes . It's reasonably intelligent , well-cast ( and well-acted , needless to say ) , and the central dilemma of the film - the complete invasion of our privacy by the government jerks who are supposed to be protecting us - is too scary to ignore . Try it and see if you like it ! It's a long movie , but it was made by skilled veterans who know how to create big-budget thrills and therefore doesn't seem as long as it is .
399252	1391795	97889	10.0	Manages to be very entertaining despite its flaws .	After years of searching , musician Harry Washello ( Anthony Edwards ) thinks he's found his dream girl in waitress Julie Peters ( Mare Winningham ) . However , one night he arrives at her diner at four in the morning after missing a date , and decides to pick up a ringing pay phone and hears a frightened rant by a hysterical missile silo worker who says that nuclear war has begun . As time runs out , and the streets fill up with insane , panicky mobs , Harry races to find Julie and get the hell out of L . A . While this movie gets a little too silly at times ( at one point Harry just walks into the street just randomly searching for a helicopter pilot ) I found " Miracle Mile " to be a harrowing , chilling , and at the same time fairly poignant ( in terms of the love story ) tale . I thought that it was well made and involving and I genuinely liked some of those performances ( Edwards and Winningham make for an appealing couple ) . One sequence that is particularly distressing is when Wilson ( Mykel T . Williamson ) , a young man who Harry runs into , sprays some cops with gasoline in order to make a getaway . . . and the female cop actually FIRES HER GUN , setting herself on fire - and then her partner , when he jumps on her in a misguided attempt to save her . Now that's bleak . Then again , the whole film is bleak . Like I said in my summary , there are some flaws , but I was so entertained that I felt I couldn't miss a second of it . Definitely compelling . Kelly Minter gets prominent billing in the opening credits but she's actually barely in the film , leading me to think that if she shot any other scenes than the ones seen in the film then they must have been scrapped . Same goes for her " role " in " The Lost Boys " : she's listed in the opening credits but never shows up on screen ( at least , not that I noticed ) . Film has a nice role for B-movie veteran John Agar , as Julie's grandfather . Lots of familiar faces in the supporting cast , including Denise Crosby , Kurt Fuller , Robert DoQui , Brian Thompson , Jenette Goldstein , Earl Boen , Alan Rosenberg , etc . Look quickly for Peter Berg as a musician in a concert scene .
399726	1391795	255121	10.0	Priceless !	Provided it takes a lot to offend you , you may get a real kick out of this delightfully ribald parody song / commercial . It's sung to the tune of the jingle for Slinky toys that many of us are familiar with . The family friendly lyrics , of course , are now replaced with some really choice , hilarious off-color lyrics that rhyme quite nicely . Viewable in both black & white and color , the video features this upbeat lady named Koralee Nickarz who really sells the whole thing quite well . It comes complete with the standard spoofing of those disclaimers common to so many commercials , spoken at a rapid-fire pace . It made me laugh heartily and does indeed have a high rewatchability factor . And the tune is as catchy as ever and may have a viewer humming it in their heads long after it's over . And hey , they're not just for women anymore .
399314	1391795	92654	10.0	I love this movie !	Cheerful , mildly corrupt New Orleans detective Remy McSwain ( Dennis Quaid ) butts heads with uptight prosecutor Anne Osbourne ( Ellen Barkin ) while they both get involved in the case of two warring criminal families . Even though they have conflicting views of the law , they can't ignore the passion that they develop for each other . Stylish , steamy , sexy , suspenseful ( how's that for alliteration ? ) thriller with an irresistible cast ( Quaid is charm personified ) and some really great New Orleans flavor . . . the Cajun music is non-stop and helps immensely . This is a film that I watched a couple of times many years ago and while I watched it tonight it all came back to me . Even back then , I guess I recognized a good film when I saw one . The impressive supporting cast includes John Goodman , Lisa Jane Persky ( who did some other films for director Jim McBride ) , Charles Ludlam , Grace Zabriskie , Solomon Burke , Gailard Sartain , Marc Lawrence , and Judge Jim Garrison ( whose story was told in the movie " JFK " ) as himself . For me , it works on every level . If there are flaws to be found in this film , I didn't notice them .
