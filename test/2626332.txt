559573	2626332	273041	1.0	Putrid .	One of the worst movies I've ever seen . Poor Robert Guillaume . Whose sister did he anger to end up in this stinker ? This was AWFUL ! I should have known , when I saw Christopher Atkins listed in the credits . Remember him ? Richard from the Blue Lagoon with Brooke Shields all those years ago ? This was so slow , boring , uneventful , and just plain ignorant . The story was nonexistent and the execution was worse . They took something with potential like The Jersey Devil and did . . . nothing with it . They could have done so much more with this . The cinematography makes you want to hurl , the dialog belongs in a . . . no . This dialog belongs nowhere . It was demeaning to the audience to have to listen to it . And the acting . There are no words . This was pure emotionless , uninspired drivel , from the script to the delivery . I can not express how bad this movie was . The words fail me , so I will allow the rating to do it for me . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
559420	2626332	277296	1.0	A Horrible Disappointment .	After the blockbuster hits of the Mummy and the Mummy Returns , I thought , " They at least have an idea of what to do with the Scorpion King . " I was wrong . The reason this movie is pretty well universally disliked is because of the lone , simple fact that the story did not detail the legend itself that was highlighted in the Mummy Returns . That was THE element of disappointment . Personally , when I went to the cinema to see this movie , I expected the same cohesion of story that we got from the Mummy and the Mummy Returns . It wasn't there . Instead , we got some crap about the guy before he WAS the Scorpion King . We got nothing of the story to which the Mummy Returns eluded . I was bitterly disappointed , and in writing this , I realize I STILL am disappointed in this movie . I don't care if it was well done , or well enacted . It was not what it should have been and therefore is a complete waste of film , in my opinion . It gets a from . . . the Fiend : .
558648	2626332	85636	1.0	Dismally ignorant wannabe	This is more a " true " sequel to the idea behind the Halloween line than it is to Michael Meyers . However . . . Carpenter's intent was to have a fresh new movie each Halloween , each bearing the Halloween name and each with a new story and a new director . So based on his intent , this movie is the only " real " Halloween sequel . Unfortunately , that does not make it GOOD ! ! That having been said , this attempt is rather puerile and attempts to execute a plot line which could have been written by an eight-year-old . It is mediocre at best , bearing huge plot holes , major annoying contrivances and only a half decent story line . The song , " 8 More Days " is both memorable and possibly the most annoying commercial jingle ever created . The musical score is an odd blend of theater and church organry and in some places it's an almost unbearable combination of both . SPOILERSThe premise : An evil toy company has hatched a plot to kill all the children via some really freaky little Halloween masks , subliminals , and magick used with evil intent . This same company is the " largest in the world , " yet seemingly only manufactures three cheaply made masks , while it also manufactures androids and the AI to run them ? ! And they have aspirations of world domination . Of course they do . Plot holes and contrivances . The movie is riddled with them . The acting quality is laughable and the character development is non-existent . Not that either of these elements could have saved this attempt . It bears a distinct 80's " Children of the Corn " type feeling in that it involves the entire town , is horribly dated , and frankly , does not bear a remake . The story here simply does not rate it . Some critics have praised this story as " original , clever , inspired " work . Honestly , the reason why it had the advantage of never having been seen before is because it is about the most inane piece of garbage on film . I personally don't see anything " inspired " about it . It lacks intelligence on even the most base levels , utilizes cheap thrills ( not that there ARE any " thrills " ) and goes for that gag reflex , three unattractive elements for ANY movie . Unfortunately , those were the good points . Michael Myers or no Michael Myers , this movie reeked , all by itself . Other critics say this is a fine stand alone movie . Compared to what ? This does not stand , it lays there , so flaccid and weak it cannot even hold up its head . It rates a on the " B " scale . That's somewhere like a on the " A " scale , from . . . the Fiend : .
558588	2626332	54777	1.0	Boring , ignorant , lackluster affair	NOT to be confused with Universal's " Wolf Man " starring Lon Chaney , Jr . This was My first ( that I know of ) exposure to the Hammer Horrors . This has been billed as " the best of the Hammers . " If that's the case , I'm stunned at their popularity . I was not impressed with this movie at all . I was disappointed with the story , the performances , the direction , and the sets . Don't get Me wrong . It wasn't all THAT bad , but to be billed their " best , " just put Me off going out of My way to see any of the rest of the Hammers because frankly , it was not good . It was not entertaining . It was not intelligent . It was not fun to watch . If you're an avid werewolf fan , you may be able to find at least one enjoyable aspect in this work , but I ( an avid werewolf fan ) could not . It did have one interesting element which I won't name here , because it's about the only element which makes this movie worth watching . If you're just a casual viewer of horrors and / or werewolf movies , then do yourself a favor and go for that vasectomy / hysterectomy instead . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
559605	2626332	118460	1.0	The Fall of a Masterpiece ; The Death of a God	. : Major Spoilers : . The " Authorized " Version of The Shining : . Was a " Made-For-TV " movie done in 1997 to appease Stephen King's wounded ego over Stanley Kubrick's " unauthorized " movie version of his book , also entitled , " The Shining . " While faithful to the book , the remake was puerile and under-dramatized . It lacked . . . everything . Compared to Kubrick's adaptation , this remake had about as many " scare you " and " edge of the seat " moments as an episode of " Welcome Back Kotter . " Don't get me wrong . I have been an ardent Stephen King fan most of my life . I was the 9-year old with the t-shirt that read , " Stephen King Rules . " But that fact does not redeem this movie as the WORST piece of drivel ever made ! ! ! Other than to have an " official , authorized " version of his work , I cannot see any reason whatsoever for remaking this movie . It was a tremendous waste of time and resources , if you ask me . Ah , the movie review . Where do I begin ? Let's start with the casting . Although Rebecca DeMornay was a believable Wendy , her portrayal was as anorexic as the bare bones skeltal remains of Queen Nefertiti . But in all fairness , that's in comparison to Shelly Duvall's brilliant performance in the Kubrick adaptation . Steve Webber . Steve Webber vs . Jack Nicholson . Steve Webber ? ! I don't think I need to go here . I mean . . . have you seen " Wings ? " He's NOT my idea of an even . . . competent screen presence in a movie like . . . well , in ANY movie . His acting . . . " talents . . . ? " are much better geared for the " small screen " where he can enjoy the juvenile humor and poor emotional control ; be given short , easily remembered lines , with two weeks to film a 24-minute / 4-segment sit-com episode . Danny Lloyd ( now a mid-western school teacher without the slightest of aspirations towards an acting career what a loss to the movie industry ! ) was so very good in the role of Danny Torrence that I don't know who they could have hired to take his place and stand in his little shoes . However , Courtland Mead ( - " Young and the Restless , The " ( 1973 ) TV Series . . . . Phillip Chancellor IV ( 1993-1995 ) - ) CERTAINLY wasn't it . This child is a capable actor who probably followed the direction he was given , but his performance was sadly lacking . His character was hollow and as whiny as was Ms . DeMornay's but on a much more annoying scale . We'll blame that on the director . Who was the director ? Mick Garris . The same Mick Garris who also directed Stephen King's The Stand , Sleepwalkers , Tales From the Crypt and Amazing Stories , among others . So now that we know he CAN do good work , we have to stop and ask , " What happened here ? " Sorry Stephen King fans everywhere , but that leads us to Mr . King's teleplay . It was faithful to his original work and sanctioned by Mr . King , himself ; therefore was dubbed the " Authorized " version . There now . I do hope you feel better , Mr . King . I , as a fan , do not . We had the book . We read the book . We knew the book , and loved Kubrick's adaptation anyway . The Setting and the Scenes : A Comparison of the AuthorizedVersion Against The Kubrick Adaptation . . . Kubrick's version : the motel was an impressive piece of architecture and staging . It lent to the atmosphere , by having atmosphere itself . The furnishings and furniture was all period , and while the Torrences were becoming acquainted on that first day , they were told the motel was on an ancient Indian burial ground . The Authorized Version : the motel was a modernized prefabricated-looking piece of crap . The front lawn was small-ish and not very scenic . Also , there is no mention of a burial ground . There is mention - at great length - of a form of croquet which was developed by the man who built the hotel . Who CARES ? It had NOTHING to do with the story and nothing whatSOever to do with the plot . It was best left out , as in the Kubrick Adaptation . K : The maze was a magnificent touch , reminiscent of the Labyrinth in which the Minotaur of Crete was Guardian . When Jack Nicholson stands at the scaled model of the maze and stares into the center , seeing Wendy and Danny entering , it's a magickal moment ; one that tells you right away , there are heavy energies i that house ; there's something seriously wrong , already starting . A : Instead of the magickal maze , we got topiary beasties who wouldn't ( couldn't ? ) move if you were looking at them . This was NOT scary , either . The only feeling of " wrongness " achieved from these scenes , was in the writing of them . K : The several pan scans of the hotel itself , with the mountains looming behind , the cold air swirling about , mist coming up from the warm roof of the hotel , all adds so MUCH to the atmosphere of the movie . A : We got very little feel for the actual hotel itself from Garris's version . It appears as though he tried to not show the full hotel . Did they even HAVE an actual building ? or just a series of set-built rooms ? It felt as though the whole episodic monstrosity was filmed in a row of badly positioned office cubicles . K : The ghosts of the two butchered daughters of Delbert Grady were icons with which Danny could identify , and at the same time , be afraid of . They were hauntingly beautiful , and showed Danny how they were killed , in a rather graphic and material way . A : There were no little girls . K : The visions Danny had concerning the house gave you a feeling for what he was feeling and the things that had happened previously there . A : Danny's visions weren't enough to scare us . They didn't give us the history of the place . They didn't give us . . . anything . K : Tony was an attendant spirit , like a spirit guide which he acquired as a result of his arm nearly being wrenched off his body by his own father . He was . . . " the little boy who lives in my mouth . " He would manifest in the end of Danny's finger and physically spoke through Danny in order to speak TO Danny . A : Tony , Tony , Tony . Wow . To go from being an attendant spirit that Danny could not see , to a rather sloppy form of CGI , imposed over the landscape ; from " little boy " to teenaged-almost-man-boy . . . what a metamorphosis ! A disappointing one . While loyal to the book , in that King's Tony was the projection of an older Danny , sent back in a vain attempt to save his father , the idea of Danny going back in time to his younger self wasn't . . . scary . Instead , it seemed a bulimic attempt to bestow the tale with a haunting new-agey quality . It didn't work . K : The " Woman in the Shower " scene . It was dramatic , and frightening . Disgusting and scary . This is the pivotal moment when Jack . . . cracks . When Nicholson looks into the mirror and sees her decomposing flesh beneath his hands ; the look of sheer terror on his face was so complete and REAL ! A : The " Woman in the Shower " scene . . . didn't exist . That , too , was Kubrick's genius at work . K : When Wendy find's Jack's " screenplay " is nothing more than page after page of the same line typed over and over . . . when he asks from the shadows , " How do you like it ? " and Wendy whirls and screams , the baseball bat in her hands . . . is so poignant . It's the point where she realizes how messed up the whole situation is . . . how messed up Jack is . It's very scary , dramatic and delivers a strong presence . That coupled with Danny's visions of the hotel lobby filling with blood , imposed over the scene between Jack and Wendy make that the strongest and most telling scene in Kubrick's version . A : Webber's Jack Torrence talked about a screenplay , but never wrote a word . K : The " REDRUM " scene . Wow . What do I say ? What mother would not be totally freaked to awaken finding their young , troubled son standing over them with a huge knife , talking in that freaky little voice , saying REDRUM over and over ? It was something everyone could and has remembered . A : The REDRUM scene . What REDRUM scene ? There wasn't one . There wasn't even a sorry REPLACEMENT scene for it , and if there was , it was SO sorry that I missed it . Wait ! Could it POSSIBLY Have been that lame scene where Danny was attacked by the " dead " wasps ? Not possible . No WAY ! Talk about creative impairment ! K : Speaking of memorable scenes . . . Nicholson's final assault on his family with an axe was perhaps one of the scariest scenes of movie history . His ad-libbed line , " Heeeeere's Johnny ! " was a stroke of brilliance and is one of the most memorable scenes in the history of horror . A : Webber's final assault was confused , weak and NOT SCARY ! The weapon Webber uses ( a CROQUET MALLET ? ! ? ) was NOT scary ! I wasn't scared . l It IS however a memorable scene . I'll always remember it as the lamest climaxial scene in horror history . K : The ending . . The ending . . ? Kubrick's ending was perfection . I felt it ended beautifully . No smarm , no platitudinous whining , no tearfully idiotic ending for THIS movie . Just epitomized perfection . That's all I'll say on the subject of the ending . A : The ending was just as lame as the rest of the movie . It doesn't even deserve being commented upon , further , so I won't . I have two questions , Mr . King . Did you completely fail to notice that the TV version was NOT scary ? Do you fail to realize it is the most puerile piece of garbage I've seen on film ! " Howard the Duck " was " Casablanca " compared to this movie ! The Kubrick version , while unauthorized , was and IS about the scariest thing ever put on film , in the name of King and yet , because it wasn't YOUR version , you bastardized one of he greatest masterpieces of horror on film to date ! ! Was it worth disappointing your millions of fans just to uplift your own ego ? Frankly , had I the money to invest , I would back a multi-million-dollar budgeted Dean Koontz film . Perhaps " Dark Rivers of the Heart , " " Night Chills , " or " Darkfall . " But NOT a toned-down weak-ass version of one of the greatest movies ever made . Remakes are supposed to BETTER the attempt , not lessen it . This movie rates a - 0 - from the Fiend because it is the most grotesque , atrocious , despicable piece of garbage EVER MADE ! ! : .
558805	2626332	120029	1.0	Painful To Watch	I'm in the minority on this , but I really disliked this film . I generally like to watch Harland Williams . Typically , he's a fine straight man , but sometimes , his dry wit shows through . In Rocketman , however , he has allowed himself to be reduced to sophomoric antics worthy of any SNL reject ( and I say that with all due respect ) and appears to belong in a Rob Schneider movie . Quite frankly , this was too painful to watch . The character wasn't funny . He was pathetically moronic . . . sad . . . not funny . This has been heralded as awesome , and hilarious , but neither is this funny , nor is it awe inspiring . It's just stupid , with no redeeming qualities whatsoever .

Instead of leaving things as they were perfectly ended , they went on to generate this ; the first installment of this franchise to fall sorely short of the mark . This movie should never have happened . It was not intended for there to have been a fourth movie in this line , and it sure shows . The premise is idiotic and the portrayals were the same . After the wonderful experience which was The Omen , this was a major disappointment which stank of 70's cheese and horrible acting . It was reminiscent of the Amityville Horror in those aspects , and left a terrible , lingering stench long after it was over . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
559603	2626332	94074	1.0	Sorry , slip-shod final act . sighs How . . . sad .	Where are the effects ? Nuclear Man has to be the lamest bad guy in a long sad history of comic strip bad guys , to grace the silver screen . And Jon Cryer ? Lenny should have been in a cage , not acting in a movie . Mariel Hemingway ? I admire her acting talents and truly believe she is a very under-rated and under-appreciated actress , but she belonged less in this movie than Arnold Schwarzenegger at a baby shower . What was she thinking ? And what happened to the budget ? Where are those effects ? Why does Superman fly like he no longer knows how ? They couldn't afford another wire for his feet ? And speaking of wires , when he lands on the moon , WHY didn't they edit out the wires ? ! Appalling ! And what happened to Clark Kent ? He was bumbling , but lovable . Now he's this dork who trips over his own two feet and can't carry on a coherent or half-way intelligent conversation ? What happened ? This has every aspect of a poorly-made " B " movie . How very disappointing . Did they put everything they had into " Masters of the Universe " and just say to h3LL with Superman ? What ? I do not know what anyone who was involved with this was thinking , but everyone should have just taken a breather , found a reality check , and done something else for 8 months instead . Margot Kidder , though still and always a bright beacon in every performance which I have ever had the pleasure to witness , looks drawn and tired ; as though she is still in shock at having been drawn into yet another of these movies . And Mark Pillow ? ! WTF ? ! Look him up here on IMDb . He's done a grand total of . . . . TWO things ! ! Nuclear Man in this and an appearance in some obscure TV show . Go figure . Again , with the low budget . The budget for this movie was obviously a paltry sum compared to the other three installments . A cheap and petty thing to do to Reeve . He deserved so much more from the producers of this travesty . And so did the fans . Do yourself a favor and just forget they made this one . Love 1 , 3 , and yes , even 2 , but skip this one . Keep your love of Reeve and Superman intact . Premise In the face of the end of the cold war , America has decided to strive to be " second to none " in their stockpiling of nuclear arms . Superman has been enlisted to help save the world from itself , by a young student . Meanwhile , the Daily Planet has been taken over by the tabloid king from H3LL , and Editor Perry White ( veteran actor Jackie Cooper ) is chomping at the bit to knock the new owner cold . Furthermore , Lacy Warfield ( Hemingway ) , the new owner's daughter , is after Clark , or Superman . . or Clark ? . . or Superman ? . . so on a double date with Lois , Lacy and Clark and Superman . . . all have a really tragic time . Confused yet ? So were the actors , apparently , as this scene was about the most ludicrous thing I've ever had to witness . This is where Clark Kent becomes an incoherent boob , instead of the lovable absent-minded , mild-mannered man we all admired . / PremiseThis production attempts to be political , but it just does not manage to pull it off . The whole lack of budget and lack of quality throughout does not manage to do anything but damage the franchise , in my opinion , and was a bitter disappointment . However , do let me state , that the flaw was not in the writing , but in the direction . The premise was a good one . It could have worked . They just had their minds on " MotU , " rather than on Superman , where it belonged . MotU , while it does carry with it some cult following , was a total bomb in the mainstream audience . Not even Billy Barty could save it . I LOVE Margot Kidder's acting . But WHY has she never grown accustomed to those dentures ? Or is that some kind of anomaly ? Just a question . Additionally , there are a number of irregularities in this film . Did anyone notice the fact that they had it daytime in the US , Italy , and in China at the same time ? Or that the capes billow even with no atmosphere on the moon ? Or that the whole fight scene on the moon was slow motion to imply 0 gravity , even though gravity would affect neither Superman nor Nuclear Man ? Or that the flag pole was irreparably bent when Superman was knocked onto it and yet it's straight as an arrow after the fight ? Or that Mark Pillow was about the worst excuse for an actor since Arnold Schwarzenegger in Conan ? Or that by moving the moon as he did , Superman would have destroyed Earth and everyone on it ? Or that Lacy would not have survived outside our atmosphere with or without Nuclear Man's being conscious ? Or that she would have burned up on re-entry , regardless of Superman's having her in his arms ? Or that Superman now has the ability to hover in the air , rather than fly ? When did that happen ? Or that Superman can move fast as a speeding bullet , yet when he's fighting or trying to save someone , he's about as slow as an 80 year old Alzheimer's patient on gin ? Wow what a disgrace .

" Bruce is a schmuck reporter who has blown every chance he's ever had , until he finally cracks and starts yelling at his deity of choice to do a better job . Since he feels he's got a good bead on what " god " should do to make things better , he is given the chance to do it for himself . I found this movie to be entertaining . . . if you are of mainstreamchristianity . If you are not , then it will be a colossal waste of your time as most of the movie shows what NOT to do with supposed God-like powers , and the remainder shows what you should . . . again , from a mainstreamchristian standpoint . There IS however , a very strong " New Age-y " message in the theme of this movie , in spite of the obvious proselytization ; to look to yourself for your own miracles . Other than that , if you are not mainstreamchristian , I suggest you absquatulate to the action section of your video rental store and pick up Laura Croft : Tomb Raider 2 ; the Cradle of Life . It is far superior to the first installment , and a fun adventure . Or . . . X-MEN United ( X2 ) . Again , better than the original , which was not a bad endeavor to begin with . The sequel gives you much more character development and a much better adventure than the first . There are a few new additions to the Mutant fold , as well . So have fun , and avoid this almost-reverent look at neochristianity at all costs . However . . . if you are of that persuasion , then you'll either love it or hate it . It promotes prayer , piety , and attempts to generate pity for an overworked , under-appreciated deity . It didn't work for me , but it may work for you . I would have rather rearranged my garage , frankly . If you are a die-hard Carrey fan , it rates a for Carrey's great performance . If you are nonchristian , it rates a only because Carrey IS good in this movie , but the content is 100 % christianoriented and is an impudent promotion of those religious theologies . If you are a comedy fan , it rates a for a couple of good laughs ( don't miss Carrey's parting of the " Red Sea .

John Malkovich is a scientist who creates a look-alike android to precede him into space . Ann Magnuson is the assistant who is in love with her boss and ends up spending time with the android . Complications ensue . Well , duh ! The suspension of belief required is pretty hard to achieve . In fact , it was impossible to achieve such an extreme level of dim awareness .

This is a good attempt by Jean LeClerc and Chris Sarandon , and an even better attempt by Victoria Tennant , but everything else is pure unadulterated garbage . The screenwriter should be shot for bastardizing Koontz's work this way and the director . . . please . The story is a well-written story , but the screenplay is quite dull , unbelievable and horribly executed . The only elements which work are the performances by LeClerc , Sarandon , and Tennant . On a personal note , I really wanted this to work . I adore Koontz's novels , but they have never given them the attention , backing , and talent they deserve . If they put the same money into Koontz's work that they shovel by the barrels-full into King's , Koontz would quickly rise above . But alas ! Without powerful people who believe in his work , I fear he will never get the chance . As an adaptation to the novel , this movie was a total suck-fest . As a stand alone movie , it wasn't that bad , though extremely weak in many places with huge plot holes and terrible , stiff , unprofessional dialog which never should have made it to the final cut . This movie failed miserably to live up to its potential . Had they followed the original work by Koontz , a bit more closely , and invested a decent amount of production money , this could have been a far better endeavor .

Danny Bonaduce's childhood was far worse , David Cassidy's ability to handle the fame was much less , and Shirley Jones's love of those kids was vastly greater than portrayed here in this cotton candy version of the Partridge Family's behind-the-scenes episodic lives . While the individual components are touched upon , the exponential elements of this hit-and-miss attempt are more miss than hit ; not only because of the writing ( which was lame as all heck ) , but also because of the horribly flaccid performances by the child " talent " in this candy-coated reenactment . There was one exception : Shawn Pyfrom . He demonstrated more than a small amount of talent . All in all ? I found this lacked the realism to stand as an actual documentary , but rather came off as a lame , candy-coated , made for TV version of reality , and as such , it lessened the effectiveness it otherwise could have demonstrated .

Kathy Bates is exceptional in her role as Annie Wilkes , a fan of ( James Caan ) Paul Sheldon's novels . Finding him stranded and unconscious in a snowdrift , she takes him home and attends to his needs until he regains consciousness . That's when the weirdness begins ; in the movie's story , as well as the wide angle shots perpetrated upon the actors in their close ups . The deviations from the principal storyline really took away from this movie a great deal . That having been said , the feeling of discorporation you experience from the cinematography of the movie leaves you feeling disturbed and unsettled . Classic King . But again , the deviations just left me saying within the first 15 minutes . . . WTF ? ! It was commonly predictable , horribly off-kilter , and widely uneven . The performances were perfect , but the adaptation left too much to be desired for this to be even moderately enjoyable . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
559094	2626332	38056	4.0	Holds Some Enjoyment , But Definitely Not The Best Chan .	I LOVE a good " who-dun-it ! " I also love a well-stylized character . Give him quirks to personalize him , and make the audience sympathetic with his cause ( whatever they are , it almost doesn't matter ) , and let the audience identify with him , and you've got a hit on your hands . Especially if the detective persona can be respected for his intellect . I love Sherlock Holmes , but always considered him too arrogant to be likable . I loved Kojak , but always considered him to be too gritty . I loved Steve McGarrett , but always compared him to Captain Kirk for some reason . I loved Caanon , but oof ! that weight would have killed ANYone ! I loved Columbo , but considered him too aloof to be personable . Chan is stoically affectionate , and teaches by example the adage that if the mouth is moving , the ears can't hear . He's adopted his children , which demonstrates the desire to be a parent ; and he is a professional , which denotes stability and a higher learning . This particular chapter of the " Chanthology " is not among my favorites of ANY Chan movie , however , as he ( Chan ) is working for the governments against the Germans of WWII . Not my cup of tea . I'm a baby-boomer last generation hippie , not a depression-era beatnik . The clues which Chan picks up on are laid out so blatantly that a child could have guessed it . It was all too easy . This installment was nothing like some of the better Chan mysteries which require a degree of intelligence to decipher . Also , there is far too much wasted screen time . This was more like , " The Birmingham Show , " than a Chan movie . Birmingham and Chan's Number Three Son got far too much time on the screen for my satisfaction . All in all , this one is somewhat of a disappointment . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
559155	2626332	311429	4.0	Wasted Potential , Wasted All-Star Cast , No Redemption in Sight	Whenever I watch this movie , I find myself reconstructing the plot and reconfiguring the graphics in my mind . I watched it several times before I realized the movie was NOT what I enjoyed , but rather the foundation for what it should have been . My imagination is what made this movie enjoyable . While it has some innovations , an ingenious conceptual script , and a few pleasant surprises , for the most part , it is an awkward blend of uneven story , poor CGI , and completely plastic portrayals . I expected more from this cast and the characters they portrayed . I expected better quality CGI for the immense budget awarded this work . I expected better from those helming this project . And in all those expectations , all I really expected was a good movie , and the finished product did sorely disappoint . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .

Aside from the child lead Zach , and what appears to be the same dog from Dr . Doolittle ( probably isn't ) , Michael Winslow , and an appearance by Angie ( Brazilian wannabe Britney Spears ) , this movie is pretty ambiguous . Craig Ferguson is great in a cheeky , idiotic , and totally inane kind of way . His performance is nothing you don't see on his stage act on the Late , Late Show every week night . I love Craig's performance herein , although he IS somewhat of an acquired taste , and this movie does stink up the place . Sammy Kahn ( Zach ) hasn't been credited with anything since 2006 . I can only hope he went on to find a good life . He would be 17 at the time of this writing . His performance is rather good , considering the dialog is written as tritely as the worst of the worst soap opera . I didn't mind this as much as I thought I would , but it's really quite bad , overall . It's okay if you're nine , but if you're ten , it may be too lame for you to stomach .

The dialog is the worst kind of cheese , and the whole execution is completely idiotic . However , the premise is rather cute and amusing , and Kyla Pratt is cute and amusing DOING it . Although suspension of belief is nearly impossible when faced with the horrible dialog and implausible plot elements , contrived story devices , and horrible production quality . . . and in the face of all that , somehow I don't hate it . That's mainly because of the " cuteness " factor and Kyla Pratt's growing abilities as an actress in spite of the horrible parts she has been shoe-horned into . I liked it . . . oddly enough .

On the one hand , you have a great creative , if non-PC , idea coupled with a capable director , pitted against a horrendously low budget , and the director's insistence that you subscribe to the premise that deformity equates monstrosity . While to some , this may be true , to others the act of denigrating the deformed as a form of amusement , would descend mankind back to the primal and sometimes homicidal mobs who would crowd into the carnival tents to view the " freaks . " I don't know about anyone else , but this one didn't amuse me .

I understand the premise , that for each Superhero , there is a Villain , and for each Villain , there is a Superhero . Okay , we get that . This , however , was not entertaining , nor was it as clever as it thought it was . It takes itself far too seriously to allow suspension of disbelief required to enjoy this kind of work . It indicated that to be the villain , requires mental deficiencies , while at the same time , contradicting that concept by showing the humanity of the villain and attempting to endear him to the audience .

I support Carrey's attempt to jump into another genre , and the work itself is awesome . Carrey's performance clearly rocks . But the whole premise was affronting . I , frankly , hated this movie . Carrey's performance makes it worth the hype , but the story itself was a cold , calculating , cashing-in of the talent , and I can not find anything enjoyable about that . This work was clearly intended to make you think . It endears you to the main character ( Carrey ) , introduces its premise ( which was refreshingly new ) , and then lowers the boom . It was the boom I couldn't swallow . I found this work horribly disturbing , and just plain sad . Frankly , in spite of the glowing reviews and excellent numbers this work received , I believe this is the pinpoint of the decline of Carrey's career . I hope he pulls out of it , or soon he'll just be another washed-up comedian . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
558613	2626332	375210	5.0	Did anyone besides Michael Keaton even try ?	Where do I begin ? This movie was intended to be sharp , edgy , fresh , and innovative . The idea was good . The cast had potential . The CGI was actually passable . The screenplay was imaginative . But the execution was poor . I won't bother attempting to lay blame except to say that it did not appear to us ( my crew and myself ) as if anyone even attempted to contribute a " job well done " here , except Michael Keaton . He is a formidable presence on the big screen , and his performance here was nothing less than pure professionalism . But unfortunately , that wasn't enough to pull this mess out of the mire . The creative flow was stymied somewhere along the road . The CGI effects were done well , but what they DID seemed superficial to the story . I understood the idea of the three " shades ; " the Beings which were neither spirit , nor Shadow who were evil personified . I " get " things like that . But the way this was told , and the way it was played out , left a lot to be desired in way of a real story line . Most of the audience was confused . " Who are they ? " " What do they have to do with it ? " were common questions being whispered around . I don't think they made any kind of a valid attempt to make this story anything to which the viewer could relate . Pity . It could have been much better than it was .

Golden II is so preciously precocious as to wax reminiscent of Shirley Temple's early performances . Burt is great here , though his character is quite irascible and curmudgeonly , but he plays those parts very well . This film features some decent action , a story and plot line which is quite cliché , and some good elemental twists , which balance out the many clichés throughout . It was muddled in that you had to suspend belief to an extreme level in order to embrace the work , but once done , there is a lot of heart and entertainment to be had . I'm not saying this is " great " or even " compelling , " but I did derive some level of enjoyment from Norman D . Golden II's performance . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
558750	2626332	204313	5.0	Darkly atmospheric , but not scary .	Is it because American audiences are so jaded , or was this work truly inferior to the original ? I don't know if I know the answer to that question , but the end result is the same , regardless : I was not scared . The " Behind the Scenes " story to the making of this movie is torrid and tumultuous . Director firing , screenplay rewrites , more rewrites , and more problems ; this production was replete with troubles from the beginning . " Writer-director Paul Schrader ( Raging Bull , Taxi Driver , Auto Focus ) has been fired from Exorcist IV : The Beginning after turning in a completed film , when producers concluded that the film did not contain enough violence . " 25 August 2003 ( StudioBriefing ) " Exorcist : The Beginning , the bedeviled prequel to the 1973 horror hit The Exorcist , has run into new problems , with Morgan Creek Prods . and director Paul Schrader jointly announcing Monday that Schrader , who completed principal photography in February , is no longer working on the film . Schrader took over the project in preproduction when the late director John Frankenheimer became ill , but he and producers James G . Robinson and Guy McElwaine ran up against creative issues in post production . " 16 September 2003 ( The Hollywood Reporter ) " Alexi Hawley has been tapped to do a rewrite on Exorcist : The Beginning for Morgan Creek . Hawley steps into the project to do a production polish for director Renny Harlin , who signed on to direct six weeks of reshoots after helmer Paul Schrader exited the prequel over creative differences . American Gigolo film-maker Schrader - who also scripted Taxi Driver and Raging Bull - had completed shooting his version of Exorcist : The Beginning when studio Morgan Creek insisted it needed more gore . Schrader , who saw the story as a " character-driven period drama " , was sacked and replaced by Nightmare On Elm Street 4 : The Dream Master director Renny Harlin to give it a more bloody look . Harlin then started shooting the $54 million prequel from scratch . " 19 November 2003 ( The Hollywood Reporter ) " Veteran director Paul Schrader is furious his axed prequel to 1973 horror classic The Exorcist will be released on DVD at the same time as its replacement - because he wants it to receive a theatrical release . " 16 April 2004 ( WENN ) So now , there are effectively two totally different takes of this movie . Two totally different movies ; not just versions , or adaptational changes done to a second copy , but two completely independent movies which are supposed to be released at the same time on 15 March , 2005 . That is just one week before the blanket release of Star Wars : Episodes I & II , two months before the theatrical debut of the much anticipated Star Wars : Episode III . While I call myself keeping up with the biz at least more than any casual fan , I must say that I've heard no publicity on this " lost " edition . We'll just have to wait and see . As far as the movie itself is concerned , the Renny Harlin version I saw in the theaters was dark and atmospheric . It was well written and decently enacted . It bore an appropriate musical score and it did effectively tell the story . But it was lacking . It was a bit limp and slow in places and just could not seem to muster the appropriate energy to achieve the buzz level it needed to do more than mildly entertain . I was waiting for the DVD release in hopes of a second viewing , but unfortunately , it made no difference . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : . Normally , I don't do this but . . .

While informative , this documentary is more a reenactment of historical volcano eruptions with a prolific use of computer graphics , condescending narrative , and over-simplification of easy-to-grasp concepts with an almost alarmist flavor .

559435	2626332	46906	5.0	Shows That Remakes ARE Sometimes Necessary And CAN Be Successful !	Remakes are sometimes necessary . At least Audie Murphy was the perfect casting choice for a continuation of the Destry line . At least this new Destry line is modernized in that he engages the other cast members with a little knowledge of forensics , which came as a ( nice ) surprise . Lyle Bettger is every bit as devilish as the bad guy of the original work ( Brian Donlevy ) , and will do anything to make a buck and maintain his hold over a small western town . The town drunk is made sheriff after the former sheriff is murdered when he attempts to stop the bad guy from a land-grabbing deal via a bad hand of poker . The new sheriff ( again , the town drunk ) pulls a surprise on the bad guys by sending for Tom Destry's son as his deputy . When Audie Murphy joins his boss ( as little Destry ) , he comes without benefit of a firearm , and bearing a bird cage and a parasol ! However , his mild demeanor does achieve some surprising results , and when he is pushed , the firearms come to bear . Mari Blanchard can't hold a candle to Marlene Dietrich ( of the original ) , but who could ? And while Audie Murphy isn't Jimmy Stewart , the final gun battle is a good bit more tense and somber than the original , which I highly enjoyed . This is one of the best of the B western line put out by Audie Murphy , and in my opinion proves that remakes CAN be done well , with the proper casting and direction . I HOPE modern film makers can find that groove . This is one of my favorite old westerns , and rates an on the B Scale . That's about a on the A Scale from . . . the Fiend : .

However , there is practically none of his rousing trademark aikido style , and by the time the movie does deliver , it's too little too late . This was , on the other hand , a compelling story with focused directing and talented acting . It just held virtually none of the bone-crunching , neck-snapping action you expect from a Seagal film . Seagal's voice was on again , off again throughout the entire film . It is a rumor that Seagal has enlisted a vow of silence and therefore cannot speak during certain hours of the day . If this is true , he needs to bow out of further film makiing efforts . I was not amused . All in all , it was a good story .

In spite of that , the story is interesting . . . intriguing even , but the supporting character , the professor , is a detriment to this work . His interpretation of the character , or maybe even the character itself , is too brash and harsh to fall into the usual Ernest formula , thereby derailing what should have been the best Ernest movie of the line .

559361	2626332	120755	6.0	Rides the coattails of MI1	It's an odd phenomenon , that of the box office . I'm finding as I have reviewed literally hundreds of movies here at IMDb , that those which gross highest at the box office aren't necessarily the highest rated films . That in itself is peculiar , in my opinion . Take for example , Mission Impossible 2 . It had an increased budget ( $125M as compared to MI1 which had a budget of $75M ) and took in $545M ( as opposed to MI1's $452M worldwide estimate ) , yet MI2 rates a 5 . 7 while MI1 rated a 6 . 6 among users here at IMDb . Isn't that interesting ? It made more money , sold more tickets , yet was an inferior movie . " Sequels , by definition alone , are inferior films . " Randy , Scream 2I found this work playful , innovative , and fun . It was not , however , as edgy or fresh as the first . MI2 tried too hard to be " hip , " or cool , and it just came off as another ghetto flick in spite of the stellar performances , well choreographed and executed action sequences , and interesting plot turns . This sequel obviously rode the coattails of its original in the hopes that MI1 was strong enough to carry a weaker installment . Obviously that tactic worked .

There have been so many of this type of films released since the new millennium became a consideration , and after a time , they all start sounding , looking , and feeling alike . This one felt like Escape From New York meets Resident Evil with a little smattering of Mad Max thrown in here and there . That's not a bad mix , if you ask me , and Malcolm McDowell's involvement does not hurt one bit . So many here have detailed the story ad nauseum , so I won't do that , nor will I spoil the story . I will suffice it to say that I enjoyed this far more than I expected . The acting quality was a pleasant surprise . The villains were villainous without the usual restraint .

559239	2626332	373889	6.0	What Was Done , Was Done Well , But HP5 Does Not Even BEGIN To Live Up To Its Potential ! !	I wanted to love it . I have anticipated this movie for several years , now , but I have to say I was terribly disappointed by this installment of the blockbuster Harry Potter franchise . This was one rich novel , and one horribly chopped-up film ! It's almost as if the director was handed a few sequences and told , " Make a movie , " and the remaining of the book were left unattended . If you have no emotional investment in the franchise , and are simply a fan of the movies and not the novels , then this movie will be adequate in propelling the story into the next installment . If you ARE a fan of the books ; however , you will discover that of the work is left to the book ! This work is nothing more than a shadow of its literary self . While the children are growing into fine young adults , and their performances are growing with them , the peripheral characters in this chapter are nothing better than lackluster , at best . As far as the kids go , I do have to interject that Dan Radcliffe has grown exponentially as an actor . He will have a brilliant career ahead of him , should he decide to follow this course . I can't wait to see where life leads him once the HP series is done and done . Emma's performances have grown over the years , as well . She seems more comfortable within her own skin , as Hermione , and Rup is growing up nicely . Dan , the world is your plum . . . just reach out and pluck it . Bonnie Wright just can't seem to get a handle on Ginny Weasley . Her weak portrayal seems to make Ginny's character more and more superfluous , installment by installment . If it weren't for the known storyline and her momentary importance therein , I would say the movies would be better without her . Her performances when she was younger , were more convincing and felt more real . Matthew Lewis is adequate as Neville . Frankly , I can't imagine anyone else who could portray the vacant look , wordless emoting , and complete lack of charisma any better than Matthew Lewis . If he didn't have at least SOME bearing on the outcome of Book 7 , we don't seem to need his character , either . His character's presence and on screen time seem to be dwindling , rather than building ; contrary to the books . Hopefully , if / when the time comes , he will be able to draw upon his experience as a child actor and enunciate around those prosthetic teeth ! You can barely make out what he says ! I'm also hoping he gets a grip on those bug eyes , and finds the ability to rise to the occasion , because in my opinion , he was much better an actor , when he was a younger boy . The " actor " he is now seems to be utterly out of place on the screen . Regrettably , Tom Felton had VERY little screen time , and I can't say I remember a single line , if he even had one . Evanna Lynch , on the other hand , had plenty of lines , lots of charm , and nailed Luna Lovegood's character quite well . Here's hoping she can keep up the pretense , long enough to finish out the necessity of her character . The Phelps twins got their shining moment , though not AS shining as one might expect due to the plethora of huge plot elements , etc . which were omitted , but it was adequate in its portrayal of the general feeling in Hogwarts at the time , though it did lack something , merely due to the writing , and in no way due to the twins themselves . They were awesome , as usual . I hope the next screenplay includes their presence , as the book did . Maggie Smith's screen time ( as compared to her character's word time in the novel ) was significantly less than what I felt it should have been . The best scene of the SERIES involving Minerva McGonagal was LEFT OUT / CUT ! But okay . They " had " to do that due to screen time obligations and contractual stipulations . I know . I know . All in all , it was the hatchet job done on this work that brings it down in my opinion . Performance - wise , you'll get about what we've come to expect from most everyone but the trio who are improved , installment by installment . Otherwise , the enjoyment factor was lessened by a lack of continuity , and the adaptational quality was zilch . Inconceivably , this installment enjoys a box office gross second only to the initial installment ! Just goes to show you how few people read , and how there's no accounting for taste .

With endearing characters , heart-felt sentiments , and clever stories which were executed with laid back passion ( if you can dig it ) , this was one of those family shows for which many families would gather ' round the TV after dinner , to watch together . The series ran for only 9 years , but they were my formative years , so it kind of stuck with me . The lessons were every day social niceties , and sometimes the larger societal issues of the day would be raised and " Tigger'ed " to the floor , usually by way of either " Half-Pint , " or Michael Landon's character jumping into the fray with whatever nemesis there was to tackle . This was a wholesome show , which taught moral lessons through entertainment . We need more of these , today , I think . This was a period run , set in the settler and post-settler days of these here United States L , so I don't know if it is even possible for this series to become dated . Like the Waltons , anytime I catch an episode , it looks and feels just like it always did . This series rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
558832	2626332	83598	7.0	Well , at least now we know what happened to Eddie Murphy's Career !	Apparently , many movie-goers were unhappy with this production featuring Al Pacino as a father , step-father , and foster-father to 5 children , only two of which he sired . Most actors stretch their wings and experiment with different roles throughout their career . Johnny Depp has been a religious experimental actor , seeking his niche , trying on new ( and widely versatile ) characters until he earned his stardom with the Pirates of the Caribbean series . Here , Pacino has spread his wings and , some have said , fell flat on his face . I must disagree . He plays comedy / drama quite well . This work features some dynamic elements , which helped support his role , namely the beautiful performances by the ( then ) child actors . This is , by all accounts , a feel-good family movie , complete with fairy tale ending , but the path to that magical ending is strewn with pit-falls , stumbling blocks , and other problems . It is far from realistic , but does not break the contract wherein we , the audience , agree to suspend belief and attempt to subscribe to the premise . Although I can't say this is one of my favorites , I do enjoy this work , and have found that Pacino is quite aptly cast herein . This work does , however , explain by what template Eddie Murphy seemingly molded his failing career . As one can tell by the reviews , action star / comedian cum family man doesn't play well with the fan boys . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
558961	2626332	120654	7.0	Beautiful introduction to Norm Macdonald's talents	Most casual movie-goers do not appreciate the dry , sarcastic wit of Norm Macdonald . Many do not understand that his blunt , sometimes bombastic delivery is his trademark comedic style . While I would never call his style , " genius , " he is certainly a master entertainer , in his own right . This style of his is an acquired taste . If you've managed to live your life without becoming the least bit jaded or cynical of anything , you may not understand Mr . Mcdonald's talent for humor . His coloring of even the most innocent scene with a dark innuendo or low-brow blurb is just so outrageous that we have no choice but to laugh . But those who do not understand , will find him abrasive or crass . It's true ; he IS abrasive and crass , and in the most unfortunate situations he lets loose his abrasively crass innuendos and utters the most outrageous statements as facts only to correct himself by posing it as a question after he's already blurted out the first silly , obnoxious thing which comes to his mind . All this is assembled together with his honest expressions , common-everyday-Joe appearance , and expert comedic timing . Packaged within unlikely settings and a professional production , Norm Macdonald's comedic style is in the perfect element . Dirty Work enlists the largest range of Norm Macdonald's skills of any one work I have seen . It is virtually a showcase for his talent . Unfortunately , it is commonly viewed as " mindless , low-brow , Hollywood fluff " and will therefore never receive the full appreciation of the audiences it deserves . The casual movie-goer will not be " in " on some of his one-liners , and the hard core comedic fans will be too busy critiquing his innovative comedic style to appreciate it . This work involves Chevy Chase as an unscrupulous in-debt gambler who is willing to help our star out of his latest pickle in exchange for a load of money . I was a tad disappointed with Chevy's role in this vehicle . It could have afforded Mr . Chase's legendary talents a bit more respect by way of screen time . I found his talents were sorely under used although the drivers were pistoned after his specific flair . I did not quite agree with this decision . All in all , this is a beautiful introduction to Norm Macdonald's talents and I highly suggest its viewing . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .

Let's face it , he's a bit uncomfortable within his own skin , and nothing he can do will alleviate his discomfort . This is great fun , a bit dramatic , but exhibits that beautiful Spirit of Yule many of us experience once the weather turns frosty and the fireplaces are lit .

559174	2626332	62512	7.0	Probably my favorite Connery installment	With Akiko Wakabayashi and Mie Hama borrowed from TOHO Studios ( yeah , the guys who made Godzilla so famous ) , away we go . Bond pretends to marry a beautiful Japanese gal and entrenches himself deeply inside the culture in another effort to thwart SPECTRE . This is a competent entry in the franchise , and takes itself far less seriously than previous installments , making for a much lighter , more fun event . However , with the lighter feelings , also comes a dialed-in performance by Connery . I can understand why he tried to retire the franchise , but he should have given it his all as long as he was cashing and spending Broccoli's paycheck . . . and THIS is my FAVORITE of Connery's Bond flicks . Frankly , I was happy he was not to be in the next Bond , and still believe today that Lazenby got a raw deal . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
559079	2626332	241527	7.0	I like it very much , but there are good reasons why I can't love it	There were many plot changes to accommodate the adaptation of this literary work to film . But what bothered me more were the obvious comparisons to the 1986 TV movie " The Worst Witch , " in which many of the main characters of this work seem to have appeared . Professor Snape and Professor McGonagall are obviously different sides / aspects of Diana Rigg's Hardbroom . Professor Dumbledore , an obvious male version of Miss Cackle . Harry is Mildred , and Ronald Weasley is Maud . Furthermore , Draco Malfoy can be found in the Worst Witch , in the form of Ethel Hallow . Hardbroom gives Mildred nothing but a hard time in potions class , Miss Spellbinder ( Madam Hooch to the HP fans ) is trying to teach the first years how to fly , and they're all getting ready for a visit from Tim Curry's Grand Wizard ( the HP's Minister of Magic ) . And , while this group of young witches plays " terror tag " rather than Quittich , and it is an all girl school instead of going co-ed , the obvious comparisons are still staggering . But ah , well . No one has sued , so what are we to do ? Harry Potter is a young survivor of a dark crusade to silence those in opposition to an ancient evil . As a baby in his crib , he was spared by the Grace of his mother's love . Although of " Wizarding " blood , the attack on young Harry has left him with certain gifts and abilities he otherwise would not have had . As puberty strikes , so does Hogwarts in the guise of multiple invitations to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry . Harry's subsequent shopping trip to Diagon Alley is very entertaining , and rich with detail to which you otherwise would not be privy , concerning the back-story and succeeds in accomplishing character depth and setting the mood for the rest of the story . The direction by Chris Columbus is creatively wonderful . The cinematography is outstanding as great attention has been paid to detail . Details , no matter how small or inconsequential , enrich any creative work , regardless of the medium . I just hate the fact that Columbus ( as Exec . Producer of this and subsequent HP films ) could not find the time to read ahead through the second book to determine that there was a pumpkin patch , rocky crags , and a second room on Hagrid's hut ! How much more beautiful would the PoA have been without having to stomach the sudden changes to accommodate the " TRUE " layout of Hogwarts grounds ? ! ) The train ride to Hogwarts introduces the main supporting characters ; Ronald Weasley ( Rupert Grint ) and Hermione Granger ( Emma Watson ) . As the " first years " ( new students ) arrive by boat to Hogwarts Castle , the look of wonder on all their faces is absolutely believable . When I first saw this production , I was a bit full of wonder myself . Hogwarts is beautifully done , every little component of architecture and design was perpetrated with an intense caring , and great eye for detail . The acting by these young thespians is honest and genuine ; truly professional performances by all involved . Let me also add here that the casting was top row . They got just the right people for just the right parts . In my opinion , there was not a single character that was mis-cast . ( I absolutely detest Tom Felton's character , Draco Malfoy . . . his acting is brilliant , to elicit such a gut reaction towards his character . ) Maggie Smith is a joy as the hard-lined Professor McGonagall . I've always loved watching her demonstrate her talents , and her performance in this production was no exception . Her character is like a roasted marshmallow . . . hard and tough on the outside , but with a heart that can be soft and sweet on the inside . Her treatment of young Harry demonstrates the love her character felt for his parents , now deceased ; murdered in the dark crusade waged by Voldemort , one of the darkest wizards ever produced by the House of Slytherin ( one of the four Houses at Hogwarts ) , and his many followers . Emma Watson positively shines as Hermione Granger . Her performance is quite believable and lends so MUCH to the movie . Her character was one of my favorites from the book , and her personification lives up to my every expectation . She plays the well - ( self - ) educated neophyte Witchling VERY well . I cannot wait to see where life leads her in the future . Robbie Coltrain's character ; however , was my favorite among the teachers . Rubius Hagrid , who says repeatedly , " I shouldn't have said that , " has a heart of pure gold , and the demeanor of a true gentle giant . No one could've portrayed Hagrid , like Robbie Coltrain . The scenery and mountain footage shot and shown in abundance is absolutely breath-taking , the direction giving this effort the professional quality for which I had hoped it would possess . The effects were stunningly clever and extremely well perpetrated , brilliantly demonstrating Rowling's extraordinary imagination and creativity , and perpetuating the magic of her original literary work . I was pleased with this movie ; though not as pleased as I was in reading the book . Jim Henson's Creature Shop did a marvelous job with the " monsters " in this movie . Better than I would have expected from Brian ( Jim's son ) when you compare his " Muppets From Space " to the earlier Muppet films done by his dad . Impressive work on Fluffy and Norbert , Brian . Jolly good show ! " There is no good and evil . There is only power , and those too weak to seek it . " Voldemort . The ending is both satisfying and heartwarming . I truly enjoyed this movie , its characters and its message : you can succeed , no matter your beginnings or misgivings about yourself . However , while it did not fail utterly in capturing the atmosphere and overall " feeling " of the spirit of the first book , it did fall short . This effort earns a large from . . . the Fiend : .
559263	2626332	39853	7.0	This is great for an afternoon , or rainy day movie .	This was another excuse to showcase the wonderful chemistry between Loy and Powell . Thankfully , I cannot say that there is no attention to detail , story , plot , or execution , because there is . It does somehow seem to be secondary , however , to the marvelous on screen relationship the principles enjoy . I like this in spite of the comparatively weak production style , plot , etc . and more for the quirky , sweet element and less for the tremendously compelling story or plot .

558994	2626332	117979	7.0	This work holds much charm , some great performances , and not a small amount of charisma .	This is another rom / com based on the Cyrano Hercule Savinien de Bergerac premise . Like Roxanne , this work holds much charm , some great performances , and not a small amount of charisma . I do find it amusing that many male reviewers of this work find it " disgusting , " and " deceitful , " where the women in the movie are the antagonists , yet men did not find Roxanne ( where the men were the antagonists ) anything but entertaining . Noelle is a model / would be news caster . Abby has her own radio show about pets and how to care for them . Abby chose radio because she is intelligent , yet by standards set in today's society , she finds herself unattractive . Noelle is her polar opposite . She is beautiful and thin , yet can barely hold her own against a fifth grader , conversationally and intellectually . " You know ? Between the two of us , we make the perfect woman ! " Uma Thurman as Noelle With the comparison to Cyrano de Bergerac in my opening statement , I'm sure you can deduce what happens when a handsome photographer is introduced into their lives . This is not exactly sweet , as are most rom / coms . But it is enigmatic and holds a strong draw to see how it finishes out .

Upon the discovery , the child offers his mother as a bribe to the officer to prevent the guard reporting the transgression . The premise is creative , to say the least , and the performances by Sarandon and Dreyfus are heartwarming and real . I liked this , but as usual , I'm in the minority . This film is vastly underrated , by virtue of the quality of performance and presentation involved . The dialog between those two is natural and believable .

558762	2626332	185371	7.0	ALMOST As Good As The Original . Not Quite , But Almost .	The first third runs slowly , with no exposition , successfully building the required atmosphere to pull off the twisted tale herein . Exposition does come , but well after the second third of this work kicks into high gear and begins to seemingly run on its own . The final third leaves a great deal to be desired , in that it offers a flaccid ending to what was otherwise a monumental cinematic undertaking . In spite of that weakness , if you are a fan of the original work , you may still enjoy this modern attempt , as it provides a creepy 2 hours ' viewing , delivers some good performances and good story , and does manage to entertain through the somewhat edge of your seat atmosphere . All in all , it isn't as bad as some say . On the other hand , it has also been overrated by some fans of the genre . I must say that I didn't love it , but I DID enjoy it .

559222	2626332	477071	7.0	Some Insecure Men May Be Made Uncomforable By It , But I Like It	This should be rated higher , frankly . Sandra Bullock delivers an honest performance . The story is quite gripping and Bullock's execution of her character is insightful and intelligent with a beautiful heart . The choices she faces are unique , but I think nearly all women can identify with her character on some level , which renders this film a near must-see for any woman in love . I won't spoil the movie as many have , so this review will not contain any details of the plot . I WILL say , however , that it has been compared to the Butterfly Effect , although I enjoyed this far more . The story is enigmatic and compelling throughout , which is more than previous reviewers led me to expect . All in all ? I like it .

558909	2626332	428251	7.0	Cliché , Yes , But More Enjoyable Than The Ratings Would Indicate	This starts out interestingly . The set up is quite interesting , and the story is better than the reviews would lead you to believe . Okay , yes , the story does begin with a bunch of college-age kids , and you know from the beginning that most of them will not survive , I'm not spoiling anything with that disclosure . But the action is quite good , mixed with a nice little bit of Vodoun , some competent performances , and a solid story line , this was highly enjoyable . This film works hard to deliver some excellent suspense , and it succeeds , leaving you on the edge of your seat here and there . I must also add that the effects , and killing devices were very well done , and while the clichés were present , they did not detract or lessen the work .

Well , at least with this installment , the camp is back . This was the more gruesome of this series , so far . It has some good twists and some good action scenes .

This is so sweet . . . sickeningly so if you're not into the romance comedy scene . If you are , this is one innovative RomCom . Every performance ( including that of Skippy the Dog ) was beautiful , without much more than a trace of the irreverence found in " Dogma . " ( Although , as movies go , I loved Dogma ! ) Travolta is not nearly as brash in his performance as the previews would lead you to believe . He is an angel and if you consider yourself to be well read , then you understand that angels were far from perfect . You will not , therefore , be insulted by this film . Even those who are overly sensitive to such things shouldn't be insulted by this work , as Nora went to great lengths to see to it that it was the least abrasive as possible , given the subject matter .

558854	2626332	279112	7.0	Has panache	Wow . What a wonderful experience , to see them update Godzilla yet stay true to form ! The first thing I noticed , and I noticed this right away , was that this was not the Godzilla of my childhood . Thankfully , this also was not Roland Emmerick's " Jurassiczilla , " either . I was stunned and ( at first ) in denial . This was so much better than the Godzilla of my childhood ! It starts out pretty much like any of the older ones . ( The DVD , however , comes with two choices . You can get English-speaking voices with English subtitles , or you can choose Japanese-speaking voices with English subtitles . Personally , I prefer to understand what I'm hearing , but it's cool the other way too . ) But it quickly becomes something more substantial and much better written , produced , directed , and executed . All that having been said , what actually impressed me so with this movie is the effects quality and their treatment of the monsters . Considering they only spent 1 , 200 , 000 , 000 Yen ( approximately $10 , 955 , 902 . 92 US ) , the effects were extremely well executed . I was enthralled with the treatment they gave King Ghidorah . What a spectacular sight ! Not at first , but . . . later on in the movie . The story was easily followed , though not so much so as to put you to sleep . The action sequences were not the kung fu styled cheese of the 60's and 70's . They were strategically orchestrated and executed with that certain Godzilla-like panache . Some Big G purists , however , will tout this as the one we've all been dreading . OH , the movie's great , but this is the TOHO installment which validates Emmerich's Jurassiczilla by including a New York sighting of past Godzilla sightings in the opening , and then later on in the movie a commanding military officer asks , " Why Japan , again ? ! Couldn't he have picked on some other country ? " to much laughter all around the table . The cabinet members ask repeatedly , " Why here ? " as if they have forgotten that Japan is home to the Kaiju , and further cannot seem to recall that Godzilla was their protector for decades . He wasn't always the bad guy . Also , Godzilla is now said to hold the souls of the thousands killed in Japan in WWII , which drags this off the Creature Feature shelf of my DVD collection , and slips it into the Supernatural / Monsters section with the 1930's Universal Mummy and other such collections ; a movie about which I am somewhat conflicted . The set models are as bad ( or as good ) as ever , the field reporters sound like ring-side boxing commentators , and the Big G looks mahvellous in his new makeover . This is obviously due to Emmerick's Western Dragon / Jurassiczilla interpretation , but don't worry Big G fans ; he's bigger , he's better , but most importantly , he's still our Big G , although Emmerich's influence is seen throughout this work in everything from a more complex story , through plot execution , monster concepts , to the superior effects . I previously thought allowing Emmerich to influence this line would be a bad move , but oddly enough , this is the only Godzilla movie in the franchise to receive the same rating as the original here at IMDb ! This venture is as implausible as the rest , but that's one of the things that makes this line so darned fun . The bad dubbing , the cheesy dialog , the obvious models all add to the campy monster fun , but this time , there were some GREAT effects ! They were much better than any previous installment , in my opinion , although the score was enough to drive you buggy ! This time the Big G relies heavily on his laser breath , to devastating affect ! and with the appearance of some of our other Kaiju favorites , this installment is one of the absolute best ! In my opinion , this is by far the best Godzilla movie made ( and I love them ALL ) ! I highly recommend it ! At a Fiendish rating of ( on the B scale ) .

558979	2626332	77402	7.0	Doesn't Have the Classic Feeling of Night , But Is Somehow Superior	This installment contains a few additional elements not seen before in the line : A stinging social commentary , an overall look at the fall of our civilization ( often misinterpreted as societal collapse ) , and some of the best splatter of the franchise . You must realize that Romero meant these to have the feeling of a horror comic . It's supposed to be fun , but funny at the same time . It's supposed to have an element of suspense , but only just , often relieved by some out of place comedic element and then BAM ! you've been punked by some horror element while you're enjoying your laugh . Dawn is the epitome of what Romero intended all along for his franchise . It is a horror comic on film , and one of the more enjoyable of this line .

In my opinion , this is the most fun of the series , and grants a fond farewell to the franchise . Our favorite characters are back and are dealing with the problems of time travel once more . While the first installment had the virtue of being " fresh and new , " and the second was " dark and atmospheric , " this third chapter is just downright fun . The story here was developed as a way of saying , " Goodbye " to the series . From start to finish , you feel it . While it is bittersweet for some , it plays out to a rousing and satisfying end . It is my favorite , though it is not considered to be the best of this run . Perhaps it is the flying locomotive , or maybe it's getting to see Doc Brown's sons , or suppose it's getting to watch Doc fall in love .

558649	2626332	95271	8.0	A perfect continuation of the original .	Picking up where Halloween 2 left off , ( as though 3 never existed , thankfully ) this sequel goes a long way in living up to the first two Halloweens . First of all , Danielle Harris is pure talent ! Secondly , Donald Pleasence is as excellent as he ever was ! Regardless of what some critics will say , this critic says this sequel is very worthy of the Halloween line . Michael has been transferred out of the institute and Loomis's care . Of course , he escapes and is on the rampage once again . Our trusty Dr . Loomis is hot on his trail . Michael has to get back to Haddenfield so he can play slice n dice with Laurie Strode's daughter , Jamie ( a completely professional performance by Danielle Harris ) . One thing of note in this installment of the franchise is that director Little used some interesting lighting in many sequences here . I enjoyed the photographic perspective employed here . It lent to a much better endeavor . I must say that this bore a compelling story which ran well with the Halloween time line . It is solid and well done all around . The portrayals were decent , the direction was wonderful and the editing was fluid , leaving no choppy spots . I also must say that I found the change in Michael's mask to be a bad change . I realize that at some point they had to get rid of the William Shatner mask , but the new mask is rather stark and detracts just the tiniest bit from the atmosphere . That having been said , the atmosphere is GREAT ! This is a prime demonstration of suspenseful , edge of your seat fare . This particular vein of the Michael Myers story is really a quite interesting take on the whole affair and Danielle Harris is the freshest innovation to come to the series so far . I can't wait to see what she does with her career in the future . That little girl is fantastic ! ! While the Carpenter / Hill idea to have a different story every Halloween was a grand idea , they should have done it with the first sequel . That would have made it much more acceptable from the fans . But either way , welcome back , Michael . Just like the original , this rates a solid from . . . the Fiend : .

My first introduction to Casey Affleck was in Drowning Mona featuring Bette Midler and William Fitchner , Neve Campbell , and Danny DeVito . His performance was less than impressive , but he did catch my attention . This is the first honest shot I have given his talents , and I must say I was completely surprised . Casey Affleck is simply stunning in this role , co-written and directed by his brother , and upheld by a fabulous supporting cast . Although this is based on Dennis Lehane's novel , this runs in the beginning like it could have been inspired rather by Caylee Anthony's disappearance , but the story quickly turns around and takes control of itself as its own work . This is really amazing , and is highly underrated , in my opinion . One thing is for sure , I'll not dismiss Casey Affleck's work ever again . That's for sure . This is fabulous .

559378	2626332	104765	8.0	Deserving of Accolades and A Broader Audience	An obsessed beautician heads for DC when JFK is assassinated . Along the way , she loses her husband , but finds something within herself she never knew was there ; courage and fortitude . Fraught with dangers only our parents remember , this film shows you what the US was like back in the late 50's , early 60's . It also teaches us that we haven't changed that much , as a nation , in the last 50 years . Michelle Pfeiffer , Dennis Haysbert , and Stephanie McFadden endear with their honesty in this gripping drama by Jonathan Kaplan ( Project X , the Firm , and Bad Girls ) . The performances are heartening and lends us hope that things genuinely CAN improve in the future . Not necessarily that they will , but that it is possible , should we apply our hearts to the problem . This is a great film , though you have to be in the right mood for it .

559335	2626332	322330	8.0	Excellent modernized remake of an old Disney classic .	With the HORRID Made for TV remake of Freaky Friday starring ( get this ) Shelly Long ( ! ? ! ? ) , I had believed we had just about seen the end of Disney's Family Films . Let's face it , they lost sight of the target years ago , and even their animations are getting worse and worse , except for a few . The sequels to these animations are about the worst things I've ever seen , of late , with no attention whatsoever to detail , or scenery , background , or character development . When this movie was originally made , it was with Jodie Foster as the daughter , and while it was a fun Disney Family Film , it lacked something . Having been made following the formula of " The Parent Trap , " you would think it would have fared better , but honestly , Freaky Friday just was not that kind of movie . In this endeavor , they actually pulled it off . It is difficult being a teenager these days . It is nothing like it was when we were young and in school . There is so much pressure now , whereas before , it was much easier to get through the school years . But it is also more difficult being an adult . Every moment of our time is spent and accounted for , scheduled and planned and even the simplest mishap can throw off the entire day , and thereby affect the next and the next . All this is captured without spoiling the fun of the film . I found Jamie Lee Curtis to be delightful . I have never seen a single portrayal by this consummate actress that I did not enjoy , and this film is no exception . I found Lindsay Lohan to be an absolute joy , and look forward to her upcoming 3 movies . Regardless of the many movies of this type to spring up in the last decade or so ( Dream a Little Dream , Hot Chick , Like Father Like Son , and so on ) , Disney was the first ( and only ) company to get it right . I adore this remake and will add it straight into my very selective Disney collection . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
559623	2626332	443649	8.0	Not a Masterpiece , But Loads of Fun	As usual , I must say I'm in the minority with my critique , but I really enjoyed this one . My local hometown theater Movies on the Parkway in Sevierville , TN , actually experienced a decent turnout for a Monday matinée . We expected to be the only two in the audience . We were surprised . I can't say Roland Emmerich has found his way back to the beginning , because it is rather unclear what the beginning would consist of , but he HAS found his way back to favored and familiar ground . This ran , for me , like a secret prequel to Stargate . Honestly , the only thing lacking was a Stargate standing 3 mounds away in the distant background . For some , this may seem like a bad thing , but for me , it was delightful . While anthropologically ridiculous it IS a lot of fun , and the use of the word " demon ? " That word wasn't invented for another 11 , 000 years . While I will not even try to point to any specific historical data to substantiate Emmerich's vision of woolly mammoths assisting in the building of the great pyramids , the Shakara texts ( though written eight thousand years later ) DO indicate the presence of " great beasts of burden " at that time . Not that I would attack or defend this element . I found it beautiful , whether accurate , or not . So regardless of the probability that one should not learn from this film , one can still derive some level of entertainment from it . But there are many elements here I found common with Stargate . Here are the ones that rise a bit above commonality , which is shared with many other movies . The cultures appear nearly identical between the boy in the mountains and the people the Stargate travelers found . Baku and the mentally challenged boy in Stargate obviously acted as the movie " mascots . " The battle scenes had a stand off in front of the pyramid with guards between the hero ( es ) and the God . Sha'uri's brother's hair and that of the boy from the mountains ( D'Leh ) were done in nearly identical fashion . They both used children ( Stargate ) and a blinded child-like people ( 10KBC ) as attendants of the God . There are more , but that's enough . I loved it . It had the look and feel of a wonderful period piece . It felt like a period romance , actually , though brutal in places , and downright gritty here and there . I was pleased overall . Although I was expecting more mammoth and saber-tooth scenes , I enjoyed it immensely . All in all ? This is going to work hard to find its niche . The guys may not care for the smarmy romance elements and the girls may not care for the " women as property " elements , but truthfully , there is something there for most everyone . We really enjoyed it , and rate is as a for Friday / Saturday night viewing . It rates an from . . . the Fiend : .
559371	2626332	92632	8.0	A delightful surprise .	I read the box . I saw the previews . I was unimpressed . But in viewing this production , I must say I was delightfully surprised . Martin Sheen delivers an honest and genuine performance as a recently-widowed father who must battle the forces of evil to keep a grip on his son . This was a very close depiction of Santeria , a South American belief system similar to voodoo , and the darker aspects of its flip-side . It also is a very realistic representation concerning the bigotry found between religious groups , but that is SO not what the movie is about . Caught in a web of deceit and ritualistic murder , Cal ( Sheen ) must puzzle his way through this intricate maze of dark riddles to save his son from the clutches of an ancient evil . If it sounds dramatic by that description , then just wait until you see the movie . It is edgy , suspenseful , and bears some downright scary moments . This is good cinema . I personally think this is one of the best of its sub-genre , second only ( and not by much ) to Rosemary's Baby , but superior to the Servants of Twilight adaptation ( though not superior to the book by Dean R . Koontz ) . It rates an from . . . the Fiend : .

This film is quite disturbing , but in intended ways , and delivers a strong story filled with tragically beautiful renditions of post-war Japan , the preservation of its ways , and the perseverance of its people . I found this work absolutely lovely in its triumph , but the real triumph is in the performances of the three beautiful stars .

The story didn't flesh with the characters , and the creatures were just plain out of place . Upon the second viewing , however , the whole thing made sense . I can't say this was a " good " video game adaptation , but the movie itself is awesome as a stand alone . It's better than the norm in the way of adaptations from a video game , but it may take a viewing or two to realize it . Check out the first person sequence during the walk through .

559575	2626332	119654	8.0	Dark fun .	From the director of " Addams Family " and " Addams Family Values , " comes a dark comedy / sci-fi featuring two of America's most loved actors . This movie is anything but a let down . The intelligent darkly comedic aspects of this movie are both clever and witty . While the science in this movie is a little lacking , the action and comedic elements are highly effective . I found the performances to be solid and well-delivered . Tommy Lee Jones could not give a bad performance , even if his director was Mick Garris ! It simply is not IN him to do so . Will Smith . . . well , I'm not really a fan of Mr . Smith . In my opinion , he is the single-most over-rated , ego-inflated figure in the industry . I'm neither a fan of his work , nor his over-inflated pay checks . That not withstanding , his performance in this movie was quite good , and even I could enjoy it . The direction was wonderful , the creativity of the aliens was imaginative and astounding , and the plot was quite inspired . We found the finished product to be an instant and welcome addition to our " comic book " collection . PLOT : A new " bug " has come to town , and it's terrorizing Manhattan in a brand new Edgar suit . It is up to K and his unseasoned partner J to determine why he is here on Earth , and to foil his evil plan . It sounds far more campy than it is . The superior direction and ultimate polished execution never allowed this work to cross that line . And while it is delivered with tongue-in-cheek humor , the darker aspects cloak the levity in a fine darkling gossamer shroud . I highly enjoy this production , from all angles of a critical eye .

559097	2626332	158811	8.0	Muppet Evolution	The Muppets we loved so much , have changed . Is it for the better , or the worse ? You decide . While this movie was more like the sequel to the original " The Muppet Movie , " in that it tries to explain Gonzo's origins , as the first did Kermit's , there is a definitive difference between Brian Henson's Muppets and those of his father : it's not as zany . The plot is wonderfully written , and acted well by the human actors and lovingly portrayed by the muppeteers . However , the Muppets have lost their edge ; the crisp delivery of the zany but witty one-liners is gone . Forever ? Gods , I hope not . I hope Brian is just warming up to those incredible shoes he has to fill , and isn't planning on changing the magic his father created all those years ago with a simple sock puppet and the creativity of a genius . The soundtrack , while not usual Muppet fare , is excellent ' 70's giants like Hot Chocolate , James Brown , etc . Wonderful music . I loved that change ! Don't worry , the Muppets sing along and dance , as usual and the adult innuendo is properly guarded and camouflaged , in classic Jim Henson style . - MAJOR SPOILER ! ! - I had one problem with this movie . Even after you go through the whole ordeal with Gonzo , you never know WTF he is ! They don't tell you ! Okay , he's not from this planet , but what IS he ? WHY leave that out ? It exasperates me to no END . Good Movie . I own it . It gets a solid from . . . the Fiend : .
559145	2626332	120903	8.0	Dazzling depth for a comic book movie	I love this series of comic books , and I was not disappointed with the movie , although the character development I had hoped would be rich , was almost nonexistent , and there wasn't enough movie here to satisfy . It is 104 minutes long and needed to be at least two hours to enable some decent character development . While they tried , they fell short of what I would deem acceptable in this area . Other than that , this movie was very well done . The action sequences were rousing , the portrayals given were a good start in the right direction . The direction itself proved to be inspired , and the sets were creative . This whole production was executed in a manner which lent the darkling feel of mystery captured in the comic book , and some awe-inspiring CG-Eye Candy sequences made this film appear to be more than it should have been . The casting is one element which gave this movie its incredible success , but the effects and story were the products of a great and loving care devoted to the production of this movie , and it shows with each and every scene . This is a classic good vs . evil story with some romance , loads of action , a great story , and wonderful creative characters . It is pure sci-fi / action fan-boy delight . Let me also say that I highly recommend the X-Men 1 . 5 Edition . With over 5 hours of features , interviews and exclusive new extras , it is a bargain at the asking price !

558701	2626332	423294	8.0	Great Fun , Wonderful Innovatives for an Animation , and a Great Cast .	Okay , I like this . I mean I really like this . Yes , this IS another " coming of age " family tale told via penguins . Yes , this IS another animated kid's movie with a " message " told via penguins . Yes , this IS one movie's attempt to defeat a similar movie with its " awesomeness " at the box office . Sony could have actually pulled that one off , had it extended the budget to include some kind of ad promo that would have worked , but as it is , Warner Brothers is the clear winner with a near $400MUS take a solid year after the release of Happy Feet . But Warner Brother's budget was four times that of Sony's , and while Warner Brother's movie is fun , it does not quite have the heart of " Surf's Up . " Cody Maverick wants to learn how to surf . He learns , and finds himself along the way . That is the synopsis in a nutshell . The work seems a little full of itself , but only on the surface . The message is that being the center of things is not what's important . Family , friends , and spending quality time with those you love , is what's important . I think with Paris Hilton out there plaguing the world , this lesson is not insignificant . A beautifully stylized presentation is backed up by some awesome talent for the voice parts , a unique story vehicle whereby the message is delivered , and some great innovative ideas for actual delivery of the movie itself . The style is smooth , if not slick , and the finished product is more than a fun movie . The total sum of its parts is heightened by the blending , rendering this as one of my new favorites ( with Cars , Ratatouille , and Open Season ) . It rates an from . . . the Fiend : .
559141	2626332	216216	8.0	Intelligent action / mystery in the cloning genre	Impersonated by " Impostor , " 2002 , this production is far superior in many ways . The casting was excellent ; many of the main players having had only obscure parts until now , lent a crisp freshness to the production . Even with a few of them lacking in experience , these performances were completely professional and the characters were developed along the way well enough to enable the audience to care about what events occur . The mental turns this production takes are quite clever and intelligent , and demonstrates a superior directing ability . The scenery , sets , and background content are all quite well done ; as if real thought went into each detail and scene , rather than just throwing a house together , decorating it like a mobile home and a hearty , " . . . send those actors in there ! " Very nice . The story itself is quite disturbing down on a deeper level where people seldom reach you . It was both thought provoking and compelling . I found this movie hauntingly disturbing . We - are - in the age of cloning , after all . This is one of Schwarzenegger's best films , in my opinion ; one of many very entertaining , intellectual action films in which he has starred . While there was not much science to this science fiction , it was still extremely entertaining . If you liked Terminator 1 or 2 , Total Recall , or True Lies , you will thoroughly enjoy this wonderfully-written , ( almost ) directional ( ly art-house ) work of art .

559571	2626332	172156	8.0	Inferior but enjoyable BB sequel	Okay , I agree with the " professional " critics on this one . It is not the same caliber as the first installment of this would-be franchise . The first was more along the lines of Lethal Weapon & Tango and Cash . This one was a more serious action , rather than the comedy most of us expected . Not meeting the expectations of the fan base is solely why this movie was rated so badly . This is NOT a bad attempt , by any measure . The car chases were not obligatory car chases , they were well written and believably executed , rather than mindless crashes and explosions . The gun fights were not just the typical Saturday afternoon at the matinée fare , there was a reason behind it . The one liners were used less , and the meaningful dialog was used more . This film has been dogged for being racially prejudiced , homophobic , and just plain bad . I disagree . I found Betty White's lines in Bringing Down the House to be far more offensive than this . The porcine woman with the tremendous breasts telling Smith and Lawrence , " Y'all mofo's need to find Jesus ! " is the typical kind of closed-minded bigoted harassment most gay men are subjected to by the Christian masses . Many times by their own families ! That was nothing new . That does not in any way excuse that horrible behavior , but for the most part , the homosexual community at large does possess the ability to laugh at themselves , and those who are ignorant enough to say such things . So get over yourselves . The " bad guys " were all of other national origins than American . Is that racist ? Not when most of the police officers were of origins other than American , as well . I suppose that was racist , too ? You can't have it both ways . This attempt was fun , with quality action , a creative dialog , and a very entertaining fast-paced story which moved right along to a satisfying ending . It rates an from . . . the Fiend : .
558614	2626332	368933	9.0	Surpasses the first !	Mia is grown now , but she is still learning what being a Princess is all about . I found this endeavor to be far more grounded than the first . Even with Raven's sudden appearance as a childhood friend of Mia's that we've never seen before , and the fact that she gets to sing with Julie Andrews ; a lifelong dream of millions of girls from all over the globe , and a few contrivances to help move the story along ; this was a top notch Disney work . As a company not known for its quality sequels ( neither in live action family movies , nor their animated works ) , I'm personally hoping this bodes well for Pirates of the Caribbean 2 . That's a movie I can sink my teeth into ! But back to this one . The relationship between Joe and Clarisse was precious . They were the couple in which I was most interested . I found their hitherto bittersweet romance rather endearing . As I stated in the review for the first installment of this apparent " run , " these movies are not usual Fiendish fare , but I must say I was enchanted .

The return of all the original cast members , the increased character development , the beautiful character development of Nightcrawler , and the addition of the newer characters , all contributed to the absolute success of this amazingly directed and executed production . The portrayals were pure talent , as was the writing of this story , the direction , the editing , the filmography , the sets and designs , the innovations surrounding the talents of the mutants , and everything else involved with this movie . I was stunned at the pure quality and creativity contained within this film . I am both inspired and delighted by this movie . It was twice as good as the first , and I can only look forward to the Special Edition of this chapter , and the third installment ( the Phoenix line and a better interpretation of Rogue's coming into womanhood and her full powers ) with a great anticipation .

558672	2626332	266697	9.0	Disturbing but entertaining	This movie has been criticized for having no substance ; no meat , as it were . Now , I'm no great fan of Tarrantino ( in fact , I hadn't liked a single of his productions before this one ) , so there are no feelings to be hurt on his behalf . There is no other reason for me to defend this film , than the very real fact that I loved it ! The second issue is the " violence against women " issue . It's been said that this movie is like " A Clockwork Orange " in its demonstration of everything that is wrong with our society . Okay , as true as that may be , this film covers MANY societies , not just American . It also shows that the woman does NOT have to be the victim . She can ( and should ) stand on her own two feet and do something about her problems rather then waiting for some Prince Charming to come do it for her . This plot and story has been detailed so many times on IMDb , that I won't even bother laying out the plot except to say that this plot was so well-conceived and executed as to win it 10 awards and gross nearly 4 times its original budget . Every single artist involved in this attempt has surrendered a very compelling finished product in that it is a dark and lovely story ( yes , it has a great story ) , that is embedded with some of the most synergistically graphic brutality I've ever witnessed on film . The action is unbelievable , the narrative is instrumental in moving the story along from scene to scene , and the score is as inspired as the screenplay . The choreography by Sonny Chiba ( who also portrayed Hattori Hanzo ) was excellent and , when viewing the final work , looked natural and brilliant . And I must say that the soundtrack of this work was inspired and more than competently highlighted each scene in which the chosen music was featured . If you haven't seen this , I highly recommend it . It's action , not horror or even drama . It's NOT for the squeamish . It rates an from . . . the Fiend : .
559095	2626332	90021	9.0	Best King Movie EVER ! !	Silver Bullet , adapted from Stephen King's " Cycle of the Werewolf , " is THE best Stephen King adaptation so far . Not only that , it's a great movie ! While faithful to the original book , Silver Bullet is also a great movie with a great cast , focused directing and ( believe it or not ) coherent storyline . . . no holes ! If you've read my other reviews of King's movie adaptations , you'll realize this is a rare review for me to make . I love King's literary style . I own every book he's done , in hardback . I see all his movies and visit his website often . But the adaptations of his works , even when he is the screenwriter , usually fall short . No , sorry . They usually fall flat on their faces . This is the exception . Not the only exception , but the best one . It takes the innocence of the novel and translates it beautifully onto the screen . The characters haven't been plasticized , the writing genius of King isn't lost in the translation and the sense of small-town , middle / lower to upper / lower class life is portrayed as it truly is ; just as in King's novel . Corey Haim ( of all people ) takes the starring role as Marty Coslaw , an early-teen who is a paraplegic being stalked by a heinous creature of the moon . Megan Follows is wonderful in her role as his older sister , Jane , while Gary Busey brilliantly portrays their " Uncle Red , " who loves Marty enough to invest the time , money and talent into motorized " cycle chairs " for Marty . It is a valiant attempt to help him fit in with the other kids ; to not feel so different . Uncle Red also wants to believe Marty's stories . He wants to have and demonstrate faith in his nephew . In my opinion , this is one of Gary Busey's best roles ; not his most action-packed , not his most popular , but his best . His performance is pure drama ; no effects to help him out , no explosions , chase scenes , car crashes , no extreme make-up . . . nothing . Just Gary Busey in pure and rare form . Narrated by Tovah Feldshuh as an older Jane , it is told from her perspective . Marty is the " cross " she " has to bear . " As his older sister , she is responsible for keeping up with him , making sure he isn't lost , isn't in trouble and isn't hurt . She's Marty's reluctant and sometimes insubordinate protector . " Marty's such a boogar ! " Jane Coslaw . As you listen to her words , outlining the story and laying it out , you learn there is a shadow over Tarkington Mills . Within this shadow lurks an ancient terror ; called a curse by some , a monster by others . Within this shadow exists an evil in the guise of goodness , making martyrs of those who are damned . As the town searches out this unknown horror , it takes them one-by-one into its misty , hellish nightmare world . Will Marty survive the cycle of the werewolf ? Will Uncle Red be able to believe the wild stories Marty has to tell ? Will Jane kill Marty before the werewolf does ? Well , that's the rest of the movie . And it's too good to spoil . Watch the movie , buy the movie . Excellent ! One of the best werewolf movies ! Only slightly under the first and second Howling movies , the rest just got stupid . One of the BEST Stephen King adaptations ! ! THE most entertaining movie of 1985 . If you liked this one , you might like " The Lost Boys , " also starring Corey Haim .

While I realize this is old news , the story's been done and done , and the Royal family has been implicated by more than a dozen sources in the Ripper run , but I still found this movie highly enjoyable . The depiction of the working class in turn of the century London adequately depicts the use of absinthe , opium , and wanton harlotry ; from both angles of the later . I found this movie to be beautifully filmed , creatively directed and written from an inspired angle . And , while I do have a problem with the depiction of London streets as clean , freshly-washed cobblestones , I still thought the rendition of the city was quite remarkable and had great bearing on this almost Burton / Ridley Scott-esquire feature film . This story is believably portrayed by all involved , and is a brilliant introduction to those with little knowledge of the Jack the Ripper story . For those of us who have had some knowledge of this time-honored walking human disease , it was a beautiful and compelling work of art . The costumes and sets were all lavishly done , and the details were beautifully attended , with a care that is rare in the industry , of late . I rate it with an from . . . the Fiend : .
558782	2626332	100802	9.0	Action-filled sci-fi thinker	In my honest opinion , this is the most intellectual of Arnold Schwarzenegger's movies .

The performances of these stellar actors are absolutely professional , quality and believably portrayed . PLOTWhile his wife teasingly steers him clear of his obsession , Doug Quaid is obsessed with Mars and Earth's colonization of the Red Planet . In an attempt to realize his obsession without damaging his marriage , he goes to the much-touted " Recall , " a memory implants vacation team to have at least the memory of having been to Mars . But something goes wrong , and before they can implant the " secret agent " portion of his mental " vacation , " they hit a memory cap which was already installed by an anonymous governmental bureau known only as " the agency . " He freaks and begins screaming at the techies , " YOU BLEW MY COVER ! ! " END PLOTFrom that point on , the action does not stop . But this is not your typical Schwarzenegger fare . This action is underlined and surrounded by intelligence , thoughtfulness and a main plot riddled with complicated sub-plots which are cleverly written and beautifully executed . The sets are creatively designed , the scenes are wonderfully constructed , and the landscapes of Mars are pure sci-fi / effects genius . The visual effects are some of the best I've ever seen ANYwhere , and the finished product leaves you feeling more enlightened and thoroughly entertained . For these reasons I say , this is one of the best of AS's movies . It tops T1 & T2 . These three , are his absolute best in the genre of sci-fi / action . A definite " Must See , " even if you are a fan of sci-fi alone and do not really care about the Schwarzenegger element . As a PS , I would like to add that the Special Edition DVD version of this movie is much more enjoyable with advanced digital sound , remastered Widescreen visuals and a commentary with AS and the director Paul Verhoeven . There is also a behind the scenes special that shows you why this movie won the Academy Awards for special achievement in visual effects . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .

This is a " B " quality production , but this Tony Jaa is far superior to the vehicle which displays his talents . Tony bears a strong resemblance to Jai of Ron Ely / Tarzan fame ( Manuel Padilla Jr . ) , and is noted at least once as being " pretty . " He definitely carries a fantastic on-screen presence , although he doesn't seem to have a singular style , but rather demonstrates proficiency in a myriad of techniques and martial arts styles . Muay Thai seems to be his base , but I believe it is more Bokutor , mixed with Prodalserey ( a more modern form of the ancient Muay Boran or Bokutor ) . From that ancient and diverse base , he draws from Jeet-kun-do , Ninjitsu , Jujitsu , Judo , and a plethora of other styles , including full on Akido at the end ! This kid looks like Jackie Chan one minute , Bruce Lee the next , and then Stephen Seagal back when he was young and still rock and rolled ! You see a strong Jet Li-esquire style , with Chow Yun Fat undertones , with the mastery of fury of Bolo Yeung . He demonstrates some amazing skill ! It's like he ( Jaa ) has studied every possible style and has mastered each one ! Aside from giving the viewer a total appreciation for this " new " talent ( Jaa ) , this film an emotionally strong , well-developed story involving the Protectors who train and then protect the Imperial Elephants of Thai Royalty . All in all ? If you are a fan of the martial arts venue , I would highly recommend this film , though it is a " B " flick , with a " C " budget and film quality . Tony Jaa is a name to remember !

Unlike many of these documentaries , you actually get good screen time with Spielberg as he explains the many components which make up the much loved fantasy world of Jurassic Park . Interestingly enough , Jurassic Park and Jackson's Lord of the Rings saga have something uniquely key in common ; they were both inspired by King Kong . Had it not been for wanting to make King Kong , Jackson would not have tackled the LotR movies , and by Spielberg's own words , had it not been for the inspiration brought him by King Kong , Jurassic Park may never have been put to film ( by him , at any rate ) .

As a non-Christian , I had a problem with the whole " Quest for God " premise , but upon watching this movie , I was absolutely delighted . While Star Trek oftentimes addresses political and religious issues , it was always done under the guise of another society , unlike this one . This movie directly asks , " Is there a God ? " The answer is in the viewing of the movie . I won't spoil it , regardless of the warning . I always say SPOILERS , just in case I do say too much . But this movie was classic Star Trek fare , with great effects , a wonderful story line , and a coherent , easily followed plot . The sub-plots were very well done , and brilliantly worked into the story . I found this movie to be highly entertaining and extremely enjoyable . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
558661	2626332	104940	9.0	Runs a Close Second With The Great Muppet Caper	As others have noted ad nauseum , this is a Muppet retelling of the Charles Dickens classic A Christmas Carol . As such , it is my personal favorite of the entire line for its reformation of classic characters , innovative casting choices ( in reference to which Muppet landed which role ) , and heartwarming Yule time cheer . Yule is my favorite time of the year , my favorite celebration , and contains my favorite sentiments . . . give to others , help your fellow man ( dog , frog , pig , or whatever ) , and love both yourself and life . This Muppet production embodies those sentiments and makes them an integral part of the overall feeling of the work , without being preachy , or mentioning any one religion even once . It's heartwarming and genuinely sweet . It rates an from . . . the Fiend : .
559468	2626332	76933	9.0	Beautiful Love Story , Gene Wilder Stylized Perfection	This production was built around the search for the next Rudolph Valentino . While this work has become dated , it was filmed as a pseudo-retrospective at the time , so it was already " dated " the day it was filmed . This is a total Gene Wilder vehicle . He wrote the screenplay , directed the movie , and was the movie's sole credited producer . He is also THE star of the movie . He does share the limelight with Carol Kane ( a pure delight , as usual ) , but this was one of Wilder's brightest moments . By this time , the world realized they had a comedic genius on their hands and after this work Wilder pretty much had the Midas Touch for a while . Kane plays Annie Hickman , the world's greatest Valentino fan . Wilder portrays a Milwaukean baker who is at the end of his rope . His idiosyncrasies are so severe , he finds it impossible to maintain employment . Upon learning of a contest held by Rainbow Studios ( NOT the # 1 studio ) to find the next Rudolph Valentino , Rudy Hickman just " knows " this is his ticket to a better life . His wife leaves him to go find Mr . Valentino . But once Hickman is in the middle of it all , he realizes his wife is what is most important to him and he sets the works in motion to woo her away from Rudolph Valentino . The formula makes for some of the best heart-warming entertainment that's hit the big screen . It's endearing and funny in its bittersweet malaise . It also goes a long way towards showing what CAN be done with no effects and no locations beyond the Studio Backlot and a few , cheap but decent sets . While it is frayed about the edges , this classic favorite is one ripe for a DVD restoration . . . perhaps even a 2-disk director's cut for those of us fans who have BEEN fans since the beginning .

558964	2626332	111686	9.0	Breathing new life into a masterful creation	I was expecting very little in the way of this sequel . The others grew tired and lifeless , with on again , off again , decent performances turned in by Robert Englund as Freddy , and some decent , not so decent script writing . Frankly , you just never know what TO expect with long-running franchises such as this . But what I got was NOT what I expected . Nothing close . I had to view this three times . At my first viewing , I was so surprised , I immediately said , " I need to watch this again . " Upon my third viewing , I realized that what I was watching was the resurrection of one of my favorite franchises ! I was ( if only momentarily ) struck speechless . I'm trying not to " gush " here , or exaggerate , so do not take it lightly when I say that I believe this is possibly the most creative work Craven has ever directed . Don't get me wrong , aside from " Last House on the Left , " I've enjoyed everything Craven's put out , including those annoyingly clichéd " Scream " movies . ( Just for your info though , I only didn't like Last House on the Left because I do not find entertainment in exploitation , it IS a fine low budget , independent exploitation film , just not my cup of tea . ) But " New Nightmare " is just not a recycling of the same tired old story with a new kick . It's a new take on a long-standing favorite BY the creator . For what more could you ask ? It rates an easy from . . . the Fiend : .
559060	2626332	84649	9.0	Well-written , almost Tolkien tale .	While the story line is a bit complex for younger children , this movie is quite well done ; well written , beautifully animated , and is far greater than the sum of its parts . The story surrounds a small group of experimental lab rats who were treated in NIMH ( National Institute for Mental Health ) for intelligence . They did such a good job , that the rats soon plotted and executed their escape , found a nice , desolate farmhouse from which to steal electricity , and begin their lives anew . As with many other socially responsive movies , the Secret of NIMH appears to have been centered around WWII , with the animals classed in castes representative of the groups within the nationalities involved . The scientists performing the experiments were those German scientists responsible for the most heinous atrocities . The rats themselves can be compared to the Boys of Brazil types churned out by the Third Reich , and so on , all the way down to the smallest creatures of the field fleeing for their lives , as did anyone with any sense or opportunity fled from Germany during those dark times . Hence My comparison to Tolkien's works . That not withstanding , this is still a very entertaining endeavor , and the kiddies need never know , until they are older , the implications of such events in this classic adaptation by Bluth . It rates a solid from . . . the Fiend : .
559581	2626332	42546	9.0	This movie is pure joy .	Harvey is a pookha who has befriended Elwood P . Dowd . Now according to legend , Pookhas are legendary celtic creatures . Yes , it can be found spelled differently . Not as well known as the miserly leprechaun . . but , of more generous and mischievous of heart . Jimmy Stewart's tall white hare friend in this movie was a pookha ( spelled in the movie poohka ) Poohkas are nearer to the Brownie or Hobgoblin . Pooka have a reputation for tomfoolery and hijinks . Their playful natures make them both beloved and hated among the other fae . Somewhat childlike throughout their lives , the pooka never outgrow their penchant for pranks . However , despite the outward playfulness of the pooka , they hide a lingering sadness deep within . The clown of the changelings , pooka laugh on the outside to hide their suffering on the inside . At times , pooka fall into wrenching periods of depression that last for weeks on end . Whenever this happens , they tend to disappear , returning once their spirits have lifted . Most other changelings do not understand this dual nature of the pooka , and few ever take them seriously . This stems perhaps from the fact that every pooka has an animal affinity that effects his looks as well as his personality . Most pooka tend toward the terminally cute , with fuzzy ears and big eyes . Most have tails similar to those of their animal cousins . Elwood takes you throughout the movie , on this wonderful roller-coaster ride of sanity and insanity . Is Elwood insane , or is his Poohka real ? Well , at the end of the movie , you see ( finally ) what Elwood sees . His Poohka has had a slip of the veil , and you realize that Elwood is not just an insane little spreader of joy who was " pixilated " by a fairy , but the harbinger of a greater entity ; that of the Poohka . Lovely , sweet , and melancholy story , and one of my 2 favorite Jimmy Stewart movies . This is also the last in which he played simple benign parts . After this his roles become much more complicated and dark . In case you are interested , my other favorite movie of his is " Bell , Book and Candle . " It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
559059	2626332	304711	9.0	Original premise and stellar performances	Do not believe the reviews ! This is an excellent addition to any horror collection ! This is a dark , well-blended horror / thriller / suspense . The use of religiochristian dogma and theologies throughout the horror genre is common and proliferate , and surely nothing new . neochristians will , for the most part , hate this movie , as it shows the darker side of the catholic church . Pagans will also dog this movie due to its erroneous use of the title " pagan " to one who is viewed as a sinner by the catholic church . So either way , there is not going to be a strong fan base for this movie . Not even a strong percentage of horror fans ( those for whom this movie was created ) , are pagan or eclectic enough to fully understand the implications given here , or educated enough to " get " the symbolism . If you fall into the select few who can truly appreciate this movie , then by all means , DO SO ! It is a beautifully written , well enacted tale . The Order , boasting the " Knight's Tale " cast ( for the most part ) , carries a natural camaraderie which stems from their having worked together previously . The story is an old one , quite creatively selected , and seldom used . This movie has elements which were expertly utilized such as the sparrows as the harbingers of the souls of the demons ; sparrows are known to be escorts of departed souls to whatever afterlife they belong . The concept of demons taking the form of children is also quite good . I realize this is not a new idea , and has been used heavily , but here , it was done WELL . The use of nightingales ' song as a signature for death , as the nightingales sang over the grave of Orpheus as in no where else in the world , was inspired and a knowledgeable touch . There are many more elements such as these , but you will have to watch the movie for yourself to find out what they are . The designs of the sets and the architecture are done with a specialized style . The dialog is articulate , witty and well delivered . I honestly have not enjoyed a judeochristian-oriented horror as much as this one , since my first viewing of the Exorcist . This was extremely well written , professionally portrayed , lovingly assembled and expertly presented . While it is nowhere nearly as horrific as the Exorcist , and indeed , the story line has nothing to do with that movie , the tale is quite well told , compelling , and very thought-provoking . There have been many films , literary works , etc . which have eluded to the idea that the catholic church has , hidden within its many orders , specialists as it were , in the fields of exorcism , ancient mysteries , holy relics / magickal items , and the like . Anne Rice , for example , has used a " fictitious " organization known as the Talimasca in her Witching Hour series which kept track of magickal bloodlines , most people are aware of the true nature of the Masons , the Knights of the Columbus , the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn , the Illuminati , and countless others . It is practically common knowledge that the Vatican warehouses thousands of magickal texts , items , relics , and keeps the human population of sheep " safe from their own devices . " " The Order " is a most excellent example of that premise , along with the moral that it is no sin to love , and if it is , screw it because love is your key to emotional freedom . It was a darkly sinister almost-Gothic tale which I found to be highly enjoyable . If you liked this movie you may also enjoy " Revelations . " It rates an from . . . the Fiend : .
559650	2626332	339291	9.0	Darkly delightful	It seems to me that once a film of a specific genre / subject hits , the rights of every like-minded literary work on the book shelves of Books-A-Million ( in this case , the children's section ) is snapped up in a whirl-wind of studio shopping sprees . One such series was the enigmatic Lemony Snicket's Series of Unfortunate Events . The books are easily and quickly read , but they are not your customary children's books with the average children's story . These are much darker , and do not provide the happy ending most children's books insist upon . Having lost their parents in a horrible fire , the Baudelaire orphans must fend for their lives when sent to live with the nefarious Count Olaf , their murderous uncle . Olaf is a cold , calculating , quirky would-be actor who will stop at nothing to seize the Baudelaire fortune but he discovers he can not touch it until the oldest of the orphans turns 18 . Olaf is over the top in the books , and is not above murdering the orphans to achieve his goal . This movie confused some movie goers as it was not based on one book alone , but rather the first three of the run . This film succeeds where some other recent children's book adaptations have failed . It is portrayed exactly as the author intended , thanks to dream casting , and solid adaptational screen writing . These literary works are very descriptive from scene to scene , and it transferred perfectly to the screen , thereby surpassing the aforementioned " other children's book adaptations " we have seen lately . Barry Sonnenfield brought the beautifully Gothic comedy " The Addams Family " with him as he created the look for the sets and homes which the Baudelaire children would visit , thereby giving it that same numinous feel we all loved so much . It is as if this film were exorcised straight from the Lemony Snicket literary works themselves . As I have already mentioned , this movie was an exhibition of dream casting . The Baudelaire children were perfectly cast and portrayed . Meryl Streep is beautiful and tragic as a Baudelaire relative , and Billy Connelly is a delight . Some critics have said that Jim Carrey was " over the top . " I agree . He was as over the top as was the character he portrayed . Count Olaf , if you dare read the actual literary work , was as much an over the top character as anyone could imagine . Jim Carrey was perfect as the vituperative Count Olaf and is just as he is in the books . All this dark and lovely perfect casting and performances , direction , and writing , is encased in a gossamer but nebulous cloak which conceals the enigmatic Lemony Snicket who tells us of these Unfortunate Events , by way of Jude Law . He cautions us time and time again to leave , if we have come for a happy story with a happy ending , thereby making us want to stay all the more . Nice device which works well . Another such device which is developed from the series is providing a dialog for the baby Sunny by way of subtitles . That was brought straight from the books , as Sunny's occasional outbursts of a language only babies understand , often prompts Snicket to offer translations . I've enjoyed the books over the years , and although the story is a bit out of sequence and order , this film was absolutely 100 % successful in capturing the feel and the pace of the books it attempts to document to film . Lemony Snicket's Series of Unfortunate Events is every bit as quirky and beautifully dark as the Addams Family movies . I found this completely delightful and far superior to most works of this genre . I'm a die-hard Harry Potter fan , so it almost hurts my feelings to rate this where it deserves . But in all honesty , it rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
559166	2626332	371746	9.0	VERY well done ! This is even GRITTY ! Wow !	I have to ask . . . Who better to play a middle-aged , wrung-out , loser than Robert Downey , Jr . ? I say that with the utmost fondness , however , as I loved the IronMan comics as a kid , and I've never minded Robert Downey , Jr . as an actor . But in this role , he seems to have found his niche . I hope this run lasts for YEARS and gives Downey the inner Zen he needs to finish out his career with some pride . Going back to the origins , as in " Batman Begins , " and a plethora of other comic book-to-movie lines ( Check out upcoming X-Men " Origins " movies , " Wolverine , " and " Magneto . " ) , seems to be the best formula for launching a new franchise , or breathing new life into a dead one . It certainly worked for Batman and Spiderman , and I'm sure it will work with audiences this time , even though IronMan is a " lesser " character who usually stands in the background vying for his 15 seconds of screen time . I am happy to say that Downey and a respectable budget resolves that condition and elevates this franchise to something more desirable and far more reverent than many other comic book attempts on film . Downey really seems to connect with this character , and Gwyneth Paltrow is so funny as Pepper Potts . Yes , she's sexy , too , but she's FUNNY and so is Downey . I do believe audiences the world over will subscribe to this newly resurrected Marvel superhero in that he is completely human . You get Tony Stark , warts and all , and Downey plays him that way . He comes off so at ease in this part that it seems he was engineered specifically for this role . All in all ? It may be a little too risquÃ© ( in places ) and violent ( in others ) for the kiddies , but the rest of humanity should LOVE it . It is gritty and holds some thread of reality , which weaves itself throughout , although I must say that the finale is a bit tepid . It left something to be desired in the big finish and felt a tad anticlimactic . Still awesome , though . And the toys . . . there are loads of gadgets , toys , and comfortably spun one-liners . This is a story-driven , blockbuster-y , KABOOM flick with very little popcorn-ery to be had , although this IS an effects BLOW OUT of a comic book flick ! It features a slick production style , top notch film quality , and a superb screen play . This superhero endeavor seems to be the birth of a new ( and great ) franchise , and I certainly hope it will not be the last . Indeed , there are hints as to another story line for a possible sequel . Did you notice ? It rates an from . . . the Fiend : .
558585	2626332	108358	9.0	Cinema rarely gets any better than this !	I found this movie moving , exciting , rousing , and imaginative . This is , in my opinion , the best modern western ever . The research done into the Wild , Wild Western days of the old United States simply blows One away . This was by far the best western of the " Western Revival " era . Historically and on the level of the saga , this was the superior film . There are no better performances , anywhere . The direction is superb , the action is perfectly choreographed , the script is gritty yet touching , and the dialog demonstrates some of the best talent in Hollywood . There is something for everyone . If you're after pure action ; however , this is not the movie for you . This is an action / drama ; which documents love , life , friendship , and death . If you've come for nothing but the " shoot-em-up factor , " then move on down to " Young Guns , " which features loads of action and very little else . If you're after excellent cinema ; wonderful direction , inspired performances , genuine costumes and creative set designs , then by all means . . . grab a smoke and pull up a Tombstone ; have a seat and prepare to be entertained .

559622	2626332	489327	9.0	O'Toole : Still the Master of his Art .	Venus is a loving ( albeit irreverent ) look into a May / December romance involving Maurice and " Venus , " the ne'er-do-well grandniece of Maurice's best friend , Ian . Maurice's latent submissive personality results in a volatile end when he continues the slow and nearly-successful seduction of his precious Venus in spite of the fact that she's found herself a beau . . . a younger , angry , bruiser of a beau . This character study culminates a beautiful comedy drama wherein Sir Peter O'Toole rediscovers his inner lad , in the eyes of a ( very ) young girl who openly does not love him . The audience sees , from the very beginning that this girl will use him , abuse him , and leave him to die a slow , painful , miserably lonely death . But Venus surprises us by accepting responsibility for her treachery . I have to say that this is possibly the best performance of Sir Peter O'Toole's career . He is brilliant . THIS was an Oscar-worthy performance , and the Academy made a large mistake , by not bestowing the coveted award to Sir Peter . " Venus , " as you may know , is the eighth nomination for Sir O'Toole , who has unfortunately never been awarded a competitive Oscar . Instead , the Academy slipped an " honorary " award upon the veteran actor , although he has earned many . It is my opinion that Sir Peter O'Toole far out-shined not only Whitaker ( the Oscar-winner ) , but Smith , DiCapprio , AND Gosling ( his fellow nominees ) ! All in all ? This is a rather serious comedy / drama with some bracing language and liberal ideas , which some may find offensive . It serves to remind us that one man's perversion is another man's lifestyle , while also allowing for the beauty of love , at any age . The love is demonstrated not only between the characters of Maurice and Venus , but also between Maurice and Ian , though not romantically between the latter . This is not what most would wish for a Friday / Saturday night's viewing , but I did find it delightful , nonetheless . There are no explosions , no escapes , no pirates , no swashbuckling , no chases , no effects , no bank robberies , terrorists , or spies . . . the are only great characters , an awesomely progressive and entertaining screenplay , and quite possibly the best performance of O'Toole's illustrious career .

The all-star cast comes together in a startling way to present this well-written script in such a way as to thoroughly entertain . The resulting final product is s solidly executed , vividly presented , well written , brilliantly directed retro-actioner , which is both story AND character driven .

558715	2626332	370263	9.0	I had issues . . . but most of them were resolved with the UNRATED EDITION's release .	I went into the theater with little in the way of expectations . I love both franchises and I frankly did not believe they could do this one properly . The performances were quite good , the effects were great ( although they did something weird to the mandibles on the Predators that I found to be a poor incarnative device ) , and the sets and story were quite well done . The story . That's what blows you away in AvP . SPOILERS . This movie was rich in story without going back and explaining all the redundant boring trivial little details from both franchises . It depends on your subscribing to the theories of each franchise and is more a " carrying on " endeavor than a " win new viewers " one . I found that to be endearing in these days of repetition . Considering that this was an extension of two successful franchise components , why compound the repetition factor . The premise of ice after having said the Predators only come when it is unseasonably hot left me feeling a bit disturbed as to why they chose Antarctica . However . Given the theories concerning the shifting of the poles , the Ice Age theorems , and so on , I have accepted that the pyramid was built when what is now the North Pole / Antarctica , was in the deserts of what was the Old World's " middle east . " I was disturbed that the Predators were less . . . predatory , and more " touchy-feely " this time around . I seriously missed the action ! Action ! ACTION ! of these franchises . So if it is action you are after , this movie is - not - the first choice . There were practically no hand-to-hand episodes , and what you did get was a bit weak probably due to the PG-13 component . Bah ! Hopefully there will be an American " R " release in the next year or so . I think I'll hold off on buying the " theatrical release " when it comes out and wait a bit to see . I can't imagine there weren't more fight scenes shot and then extracted as a marketing ploy for later use . By " touchy-feely , " I mean the love / team interest forged between Sanaa Lathan's character Alexa Woods and the surviving underground Predator . That was completely out of character for the Predators , in my opinion . Okay , I realize it is a carry-over from Predator 2 where the Predators acquire a respect for Danny Glover's character in the end . However , to quote " Howard the Duck " . . . " This relationship defies all the laws of Nature ! " Though it's hardly a romance , there are far too many cutesy moments in this endeavor to suit my Predator / Alien tastes . In fact , this feature alone lent a feeling of " this is stupid " to this whole movie ; a thought I had to keep pushing back during my theatrical viewing and detracted immensely from the final product . The premise , however , was quite well done , in spite of the obvious flaws . In Bishop's endeavor to live what is left of his extended " life " to the fullest , he embarks upon this journey in the hopes of surviving one last grand adventure . Not a new element to the cinematic world , but still effective . I - wanted - him to go , and I - wanted - him to succeed . Perhaps , that is only because he was the only character from the original franchise to make this attempt . This attempt bore no other original members from either franchise , by the way . The idea of the pyramid bearing the three types of ancient civilizational writings , thoughts and designs was outstanding . Quite clever interpretation of the placement of the great pyramids on the Earth , and the origins of the Gods of mankind . Perhaps it was a Predator bomb that caused the Tunguska blast of 1908 . The effects were well done , and the makeup artists surrendered their best , as expected . As I said before , the mandible adjustments on the Predator were a bit off-putting , but then again , they were never beautiful creatures to begin with . The pyramid was well done , the glyphs were realistic , the adornments were creatively and historically presented , and the aliens were expertly done . Just another small question . . . In all the years the Predators have been fighting the Aliens , - why - is their armor not acid-proofed ? Just a thought . In an attempt to make this more attractive to " arthouse " fans rather than fans of the original franchises , the story line was given more screen time than the action one would expect from a movie which carries these two franchises . Even with this distraction AVP was very watchable . The Unrated Director's Cut ( which Anderson promised fans from the beginning , IF you will remember ) , is as the movie should have been . You are given eight more minutes . Now , I can already hear the cries of malcontent . " Eight MINUTES ? ! " But I can tell you that 8 seconds added here , and 5 seconds added there , really do serve well to flesh out the story , give you the details previously missed , and extend the Alien / Predator fight adequately enough so that fans are , at last , appeased . The story is in the UNRATED EDITION . The action is in the UNRATED EDITION . The version which makes sense is the UNRATED EDITION . The PG-13 edition is the chopped up , convoluted crap-fest we saw at the theaters . Thanks to the studio for letting Anderson have this UNRATED EDITION . It goes a long way towards salvaging what we KNEW was NOT an inferior film . The PG-13 version just made it seem inferior . The Theatrical Version rates a .

558642	2626332	382625	10.0	Solid , faithful adaptation , which presents some beautiful portrayals , a little gritty action , and a compelling story .	WARNING : SPOILERS AT THE BOTTOM ! First off , this review is concerning the movie , not the book itself . I will begin with the casting . There has been a lot said over the past year or so since the casting list was unveiled , expressing misgivings concerning what has been called the " miscasting " of Tom Hanks in the role as Robert Langdon . I am happy to report that earlier misgivings were completely unfounded . Tom Hanks delivers a performance reminiscent of his earlier days when he was more relaxed in his execution , and seems to have rediscovered his remarkable talents . Ian McKellen contributes a believability to his performance , which is so strong , as to make you consider ( if only for a brief while ) whether or not he has personal interest in the Grail . He was remarkable as Leigh Teabing , but would you really expect anything less of him ? Certainly not ! Audrey Tautou gave a refreshingly capable performance as Agent Sophie Neveu . She portrayed her character with a polished professionalism one might not expect from a relative newcomer to the world of American films . Of course , people who think like that are in for a rude awakening , and Audrey Tautou is just the one to give it to them . Jean Reno enacted a character which goes through some heart-felt changes . He does so with a style and grace amid the action sequences involving French Police Captain Fache in a portrayal which is reminiscent of his riveting spot lit performance as the Professional . The principle difference between the two characters , and Reno's enactment of them , is that there is much more time for character development in the Professional wherein the audience may get to " know " the character . In the DaVinci Code , Fache's ( pronounced Fash , by the way ) character was one of peripheral standing and , therefore , there was very little in the way of opening character development where his character was concerned . He manages quite succinctly , however , to give you enough of the back-story of his motivations and motives to allow you a brief window into the many-faceted man who is Captain Fache . His performance was possibly one of his best , to date . And that leaves Paul Bettany . I was concerned , never having seen him portray such a complex character as Silas . I am here to apologize for my earlier misgivings . He portrayed Silas dead on . The raw ( and sometimes confused and clouded ) emotion he exhibited was spot on and we , the audience , found a certain reality in his portrayal . He was brilliant . And after all that , I still feel the need to say that Ron Howard was the real star of this work . His choices of camera angles , filming techniques , effects , and overall direction shine through it all in such a way as to solidly cement his name into the list of top directors . Some would argue that he was already there , and he was . But he is affirmed , confirmed , and reaffirmed as one of the best directors in the world . The work itself was an extremely faithful adaptation . It was gritty , and had us completely involved in the story , even though we were all fans of the book , and already knew what to expect . The execution of the action was shockingly realistic . I would not take children under 16 to see this , personally , and would have to think a bit before subjecting a 16-year-old to it . Silas's use of the cilice ( which , according to my dictionary , is a hair-coat much like Robbie Coltrane wears while filming Harry Potter ) and self flagellation is quite graphic . However , if they have seen the Passion of the Christ , then they can most definitely handle this . As far as the subject matter goes , this is neither the time , nor the place for that discussion . I will say that this work of fiction fully utilizes the potential presented by the prior historical research upon which it was based ; namely , " Holy Blood , Holy Grail . " It is a work of fiction lovingly interwoven throughout some compelling historical hypotheses presented by Michael Baigent , Richard Leigh , and Henry Lincoln in their aforementioned published historical work . The Catholic Church has issued condemnation after condemnation of this work . They should know better than to condemn a movie , by now . All it does is raise the box office sales , by piquing the interest in people who normally would have no desire to see the work . It bestowed such a high level of exposure that many people who never would have even heard of it , are now going to see it . Opus Dei has also wrongly condemned the movie for portraying them in a less than favorable light . That is not the case . It is made quite clear that Silas's mental stability is not only in question , but is doubtful . I was obviously just an opportunistic grab for their fifteen minutes of fame , than any true objection they may have had to the film at large . SPOILERSBook fans may be interested in knowing that there were four scenes omitted from the cinematic version . These scenes had no determination or bearing to the outcome of the story , and were therefore not missed . . . merely noticed . Namely , Sophie never puts it together that her grandmother was the woman who was with her grandfather during the rite . And she is not told ( at least not in our presence ) that the gap-toothed boy who attends Roslyn Chapel is her brother . You are shown the photo of the boy as a child , and you realize ( if you've read the book ) that it is her brother , but they never say it . The Madonna on the Rocks sequences were omitted for time . The ending is different than the novelized version , but more enjoyable . END SPOILERS ! ! That not withstanding , The DaVinci Code is highly enjoyable , regardless of your religious views . It is a work of FICTION , and as such , was entertainingly engrossing . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
559084	2626332	320691	10.0	Underworld . A new legend is born .	Let me start this review by saying that , while this work is NOT scary , it was not MEANT to be scary . This production was classed into the genre of " Horror , " strictly due to the " monster " factor . There are " tense " moments , to be sure , but this is not a " boo ! " kind of movie . There is ; however , plenty of action , lots of well enacted drama and wonderful realistic effects . I was actually amazed with the apparent lack of high-dollar effects , the almost Rice-ian Vampire clans lounging in the well designed lush and lavish " mansion , " the gritty tension held throughout the movie , and the stunningly clever costume designs . But what held me mostly in thrall were the effects . The effects were so well done , they were believable . They explain that the older Lycan can change at will , regardless of the moon's cycle . . . with that in mind , the way the werewolves ' mandible bones FORCED themselves out and into place was dead ON . Changing at will would BE like that , especially in times of anger or great stress . Someone ( possibly Wiseman ? ) had heard ( and correctly believed ) that " less is more , " because the effects were done in such a way as to appear REAL and not . . . simply more Hollywood " Matrix " flash . These scenes were so well done ; so well directed , filmed and portrayed that we could , even if for a short time , believe the things we were watching . . . were possible . The wonderfully unique bullets used by both sides are absolutely brilliant . It reminded me if the horribly campy western / vampire movie made about 10 or 15 years ago entitled , " Sundown , " where the vampire hunters used wooden bullets . I am simply stunned to discover that this is Len Wiseman's first attempt in the field as Director . I eagerly look forward to more brilliance from this man . ( He was also one of the writers of the original literary work . ) If this is his first attempt , we may have just been introduced to the next Spielberg . Personally , I'm hoping he leans more towards being the next Hitchcock . The weaponry Selene ( Kate Beckinsale ) utilized was quite unique and completely interested the small audience in my hometown theater . When she drew her stars and threw them simultaneously at the Lycan ; when the scene slowed to an almost stop just long enough to allow you to SEE the throwing stars as they CHANGED into much more deadly projectiles , was absolutely excellent . AND was also the ONLY scene in this entire movie which even remotely reminded me of " The Matrix . " The other critics keep droning on and on with comparisons between these two movies , and frankly , I just don't see it . Also , " Blade " has been used as a source of comparison . The only similarities between " Blade " and " Underworld " are that Viktor , the oldest and strongest of the Vampiric race of " Pure Bloods , " uses a sword . Oh , and there are Vampires . Those were the ONLY common points , as far as I could tell . This is an original work ; not a petty rip-off or a " jumble of other movies . " This is a very creative and unique attempt ; a successful one , if you ask me . While guns were used more than I would have liked , the additional weaponry chosen for this endeavor was not your standard action-flick fare . One of the vampire " Death Dealers " uses a pair of 10 ' whips quite well . And don't forget about the bullets I mentioned . . . what an extraordinary intellectual and creative power . The costumes were kept simple , yet served the purpose of helping to set the mood . Two words . . . understated elegance . Absolutely brilliant . Some have said that the story line is hard to follow , or that there is no discernible plot . Let me be frank . This is not a movie for the squeamish , nor is it a movie for those who like to be able to NOT concentrate on the plot . Sure , there is enough visual eye candy to keep most casual fans of the genre entertained , but there is also a very complicated and beautifully sinister plot and subplots going on beneath the flying bullets and shots of Kate Beckinsale's butt in latex and leather . The Shakespearean relationship between Selene and Michael ( Scott Speedman ) is well written and pleasantly portrayed , in the midst of all that darkness and drama . A bit of candle-light to shine hope into the darkness of despair , as it were . The story is an upgraded spin on a timeless classic , with enough additional plot and sub-plot to keep even the most common movie-goer interested . The war between the Vampires and the Lycan has raged for more than a thousand years . The Lycan , once the serving class to the Vampire , had risen against their masters and won their freedom . But was that the real story ? Was their freedom truly the motivating force which stoked the fires of this war for this long ? In the center of this war are Selene ( Vampire ) and Michael ( Lycan ) . Their love of one another is forbidden by every Vampire Covenant written , but will that be enough to stop them from falling in love ? As one of the chosen " Death Dealers , " an organization within the Vampire Clans trained and equipped to hunt and kill Lycans , Selene is faced with a decision most dire : sell out and live ? or be true to herself and die ? Will her loyalty to her ancient maker keep her from making the right choice ? And that is where the sub-plot kicks into overdrive and makes you sit back and say , " Oh wow ! No kidding ? ! " at the darkling twists in the plot . I was thoroughly entertained by this work , and cannot wait to add the DVD to the Vampire section of my horror collection . Superb acting ; rich depth of character ; talented , creative directing ; and realistic effects put this movie at the top of all other Vampyre movies , for me . It earns an ambitious from . . . the Fiend : .
559550	2626332	70917	10.0	Dated , atmospheric shocker still inspires	Gruesome and not all together accurate , depiction of the Old Pagan Ways , but beautiful in some ways , nonetheless . As a Pagan , I must say that I was not surprised to find that Pagans were depicted as the villains here . Such is the way of man , to fear what he does not understand , and to seek to destroy that which he fears . Other than that one gripe , I found the whole human sacrifice ploy to be indicative of the condition about which I first spoke . All religions of old practiced human sacrifice at one time or another , including the religion of choice of mainstream America ; Christianity . I found it a convenient and contrived device to use here , after such beauty was displayed . But perhaps that was the intent of the director ; to lull us with the wonders of Pagan revelry and then murder that lulled sense of placation with the horrors that follow . Whichever the case , it worked . This movie is a beautiful glimpse into the world which was , and then you are plunged into the darker side of that same world . As Satanists / Luciferians are considered to be a Christian heresy , so is the type of rite featured at the end of this movie , to the Pagan community at large . The burning of the " stuffy guy , " " corn man , " " wicker man , " or " John Barleycorn " is a beautiful and sacred tradition among many in the Pagan fold , as there are as many denominations of Paganism as there are in Christianity . The corn man was filled with animals raised as sacrament to the God of the Hunt . Fresh fruits and grains ( the best of the previous year's harvest ) were placed into the corn man's extremities , he was erected and burned as a burnt offering to the Goddess as a wedding present . She marries the God on Beltane , or May Day if you prefer . Macy's still has a beautiful May Day parade , and many schools still celebrate May Day with festivals ; some still featuring the May Pole . Just as there are fall festivals , there are still spring festivals the world over . Most do not remember why , but some of us do . I found the duplicity of this particular group of Pagans to be delightfully dark and highly enjoyable ; sneaky , underhanded and just wrong , but enjoyable to watch . But if you are not of the Pagan Folds , never fear . This movie does not glamorize Paganism . To the contrary , it drags us back to the Dark Ages when human sacrifice was an acceptable means of offering , and human life was not yet considered sacred . So it will sit well with your fine sensibilities and not compromise your self-righteous indignations . Watch it for yourself to witness one of the most beautifully dark movies to ever be committed to film . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
559200	2626332	82348	10.0	Simply Magickal	I saw this movie in the theater 127 times . Paid for it 127 times . It was a very moving piece of cinema . Well told , beautifully portrayed and brilliantly captured . While it is beginning to show signs of wear about the edges , this movie is the epitome of the King Aurhur legend . It has every element , every character , every nuance one would expect to find . But it also has some beneficial extras which allow you to become involved in this beautiful , treacherous web of intrigue , magick , love , and death . Each scene was shot with a creative eye and love for the craft of film making . The set designs were awesomely executed , leaving one with a rock-solid sense of realism . The symbolism used is astounding considering the amount of research which had to have been done . The Quest for the Holy Grail within this telling is metaphorically representative of each man's search for immortality , a sense of self , and inner enlightenment . It shows we must go on our own journeys , make our own mistakes , and pass our own tests in order to gain the insights one needs to feel whole and complete as an adult and a person . This work bears some of the best musical score I've ever heard . Trevor Jones ' score set the entire mood of this film , carried it through the few spots , and uplifted it to a level it otherwise may not have found . While the various versions of Arthur were excellently portrayed and artfully executed , Nicol Williamson's portrayal of Merlin was pure silk . The beautiful cinematography and Nicol Williamson's performance allow you to believe you are a part of the actual events surrounding the King Arthur legend . Nicol Williamson was the shining star of this work . He made it real , for me . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
