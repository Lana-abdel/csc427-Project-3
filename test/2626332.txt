559573	2626332	273041	1.0	Putrid .	One of the worst movies I've ever seen . Poor Robert Guillaume . Whose sister did he anger to end up in this stinker ? This was AWFUL ! I should have known , when I saw Christopher Atkins listed in the credits . Remember him ? Richard from the Blue Lagoon with Brooke Shields all those years ago ? This was so slow , boring , uneventful , and just plain ignorant . The story was nonexistent and the execution was worse . They took something with potential like The Jersey Devil and did . . . nothing with it . They could have done so much more with this . The cinematography makes you want to hurl , the dialog belongs in a . . . no . This dialog belongs nowhere . It was demeaning to the audience to have to listen to it . And the acting .

558588	2626332	54777	1.0	Boring , ignorant , lackluster affair	NOT to be confused with Universal's " Wolf Man " starring Lon Chaney , Jr . This was My first ( that I know of ) exposure to the Hammer Horrors . This has been billed as " the best of the Hammers . " If that's the case , I'm stunned at their popularity . I was not impressed with this movie at all . I was disappointed with the story , the performances , the direction , and the sets . Don't get Me wrong . It wasn't all THAT bad , but to be billed their " best , " just put Me off going out of My way to see any of the rest of the Hammers because frankly , it was not good . It was not entertaining . It was not intelligent . It was not fun to watch . If you're an avid werewolf fan , you may be able to find at least one enjoyable aspect in this work , but I ( an avid werewolf fan ) could not . It did have one interesting element which I won't name here , because it's about the only element which makes this movie worth watching . If you're just a casual viewer of horrors and / or werewolf movies , then do yourself a favor and go for that vasectomy / hysterectomy instead . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
559605	2626332	118460	1.0	The Fall of a Masterpiece ; The Death of a God	. : Major Spoilers : . The " Authorized " Version of The Shining : . Was a " Made-For-TV " movie done in 1997 to appease Stephen King's wounded ego over Stanley Kubrick's " unauthorized " movie version of his book , also entitled , " The Shining . " While faithful to the book , the remake was puerile and under-dramatized . It lacked . . . everything . Compared to Kubrick's adaptation , this remake had about as many " scare you " and " edge of the seat " moments as an episode of " Welcome Back Kotter . " Don't get me wrong . I have been an ardent Stephen King fan most of my life . I was the 9-year old with the t-shirt that read , " Stephen King Rules . " But that fact does not redeem this movie as the WORST piece of drivel ever made ! ! ! Other than to have an " official , authorized " version of his work , I cannot see any reason whatsoever for remaking this movie . It was a tremendous waste of time and resources , if you ask me . Ah , the movie review . Where do I begin ? Let's start with the casting . Although Rebecca DeMornay was a believable Wendy , her portrayal was as anorexic as the bare bones skeltal remains of Queen Nefertiti . But in all fairness , that's in comparison to Shelly Duvall's brilliant performance in the Kubrick adaptation . Steve Webber . Steve Webber vs . Jack Nicholson . Steve Webber ? ! I don't think I need to go here . I mean . . . have you seen " Wings ? " He's NOT my idea of an even . . . competent screen presence in a movie like . . . well , in ANY movie . His acting . . . " talents . . . ? " are much better geared for the " small screen " where he can enjoy the juvenile humor and poor emotional control ; be given short , easily remembered lines , with two weeks to film a 24-minute / 4-segment sit-com episode . Danny Lloyd ( now a mid-western school teacher without the slightest of aspirations towards an acting career what a loss to the movie industry ! ) was so very good in the role of Danny Torrence that I don't know who they could have hired to take his place and stand in his little shoes . However , Courtland Mead ( - " Young and the Restless , The " ( 1973 ) TV Series . . . . Phillip Chancellor IV ( 1993-1995 ) - ) CERTAINLY wasn't it . This child is a capable actor who probably followed the direction he was given , but his performance was sadly lacking . His character was hollow and as whiny as was Ms . DeMornay's but on a much more annoying scale . We'll blame that on the director . Who was the director ? Mick Garris . The same Mick Garris who also directed Stephen King's The Stand , Sleepwalkers , Tales From the Crypt and Amazing Stories , among others . So now that we know he CAN do good work , we have to stop and ask , " What happened here ? " Sorry Stephen King fans everywhere , but that leads us to Mr . King's teleplay . It was faithful to his original work and sanctioned by Mr . King , himself ; therefore was dubbed the " Authorized " version . There now . I do hope you feel better , Mr . King . I , as a fan , do not . We had the book . We read the book . We knew the book , and loved Kubrick's adaptation anyway . The Setting and the Scenes : A Comparison of the AuthorizedVersion Against The Kubrick Adaptation . . . Kubrick's version : the motel was an impressive piece of architecture and staging . It lent to the atmosphere , by having atmosphere itself . The furnishings and furniture was all period , and while the Torrences were becoming acquainted on that first day , they were told the motel was on an ancient Indian burial ground . The Authorized Version : the motel was a modernized prefabricated-looking piece of crap . The front lawn was small-ish and not very scenic . Also , there is no mention of a burial ground . There is mention - at great length - of a form of croquet which was developed by the man who built the hotel . Who CARES ? It had NOTHING to do with the story and nothing whatSOever to do with the plot . It was best left out , as in the Kubrick Adaptation . K : The maze was a magnificent touch , reminiscent of the Labyrinth in which the Minotaur of Crete was Guardian . When Jack Nicholson stands at the scaled model of the maze and stares into the center , seeing Wendy and Danny entering , it's a magickal moment ; one that tells you right away , there are heavy energies i that house ; there's something seriously wrong , already starting . A : Instead of the magickal maze , we got topiary beasties who wouldn't ( couldn't ? ) move if you were looking at them . This was NOT scary , either . The only feeling of " wrongness " achieved from these scenes , was in the writing of them . K : The several pan scans of the hotel itself , with the mountains looming behind , the cold air swirling about , mist coming up from the warm roof of the hotel , all adds so MUCH to the atmosphere of the movie . A : We got very little feel for the actual hotel itself from Garris's version . It appears as though he tried to not show the full hotel . Did they even HAVE an actual building ? or just a series of set-built rooms ? It felt as though the whole episodic monstrosity was filmed in a row of badly positioned office cubicles . K : The ghosts of the two butchered daughters of Delbert Grady were icons with which Danny could identify , and at the same time , be afraid of . They were hauntingly beautiful , and showed Danny how they were killed , in a rather graphic and material way . A : There were no little girls . K : The visions Danny had concerning the house gave you a feeling for what he was feeling and the things that had happened previously there . A : Danny's visions weren't enough to scare us . They didn't give us the history of the place . They didn't give us . . . anything . K : Tony was an attendant spirit , like a spirit guide which he acquired as a result of his arm nearly being wrenched off his body by his own father . He was . . . " the little boy who lives in my mouth . " He would manifest in the end of Danny's finger and physically spoke through Danny in order to speak TO Danny . A : Tony , Tony , Tony . Wow . To go from being an attendant spirit that Danny could not see , to a rather sloppy form of CGI , imposed over the landscape ; from " little boy " to teenaged-almost-man-boy . . . what a metamorphosis ! A disappointing one . While loyal to the book , in that King's Tony was the projection of an older Danny , sent back in a vain attempt to save his father , the idea of Danny going back in time to his younger self wasn't . . . scary . Instead , it seemed a bulimic attempt to bestow the tale with a haunting new-agey quality . It didn't work . K : The " Woman in the Shower " scene . It was dramatic , and frightening . Disgusting and scary . This is the pivotal moment when Jack . . . cracks . When Nicholson looks into the mirror and sees her decomposing flesh beneath his hands ; the look of sheer terror on his face was so complete and REAL ! A : The " Woman in the Shower " scene . . . didn't exist . That , too , was Kubrick's genius at work . K : When Wendy find's Jack's " screenplay " is nothing more than page after page of the same line typed over and over . . . when he asks from the shadows , " How do you like it ? " and Wendy whirls and screams , the baseball bat in her hands . . . is so poignant . It's the point where she realizes how messed up the whole situation is . . . how messed up Jack is . It's very scary , dramatic and delivers a strong presence . That coupled with Danny's visions of the hotel lobby filling with blood , imposed over the scene between Jack and Wendy make that the strongest and most telling scene in Kubrick's version . A : Webber's Jack Torrence talked about a screenplay , but never wrote a word . K : The " REDRUM " scene . Wow . What do I say ? What mother would not be totally freaked to awaken finding their young , troubled son standing over them with a huge knife , talking in that freaky little voice , saying REDRUM over and over ? It was something everyone could and has remembered . A : The REDRUM scene . What REDRUM scene ? There wasn't one . There wasn't even a sorry REPLACEMENT scene for it , and if there was , it was SO sorry that I missed it . Wait ! Could it POSSIBLY Have been that lame scene where Danny was attacked by the " dead " wasps ? Not possible . No WAY ! Talk about creative impairment ! K : Speaking of memorable scenes . . . Nicholson's final assault on his family with an axe was perhaps one of the scariest scenes of movie history . His ad-libbed line , " Heeeeere's Johnny ! " was a stroke of brilliance and is one of the most memorable scenes in the history of horror . A : Webber's final assault was confused , weak and NOT SCARY ! The weapon Webber uses ( a CROQUET MALLET ? ! ? ) was NOT scary ! I wasn't scared . l It IS however a memorable scene . I'll always remember it as the lamest climaxial scene in horror history . K : The ending . . The ending . . ? Kubrick's ending was perfection . I felt it ended beautifully . No smarm , no platitudinous whining , no tearfully idiotic ending for THIS movie . Just epitomized perfection . That's all I'll say on the subject of the ending . A : The ending was just as lame as the rest of the movie . It doesn't even deserve being commented upon , further , so I won't . I have two questions , Mr . King . Did you completely fail to notice that the TV version was NOT scary ? Do you fail to realize it is the most puerile piece of garbage I've seen on film ! " Howard the Duck " was " Casablanca " compared to this movie ! The Kubrick version , while unauthorized , was and IS about the scariest thing ever put on film , in the name of King and yet , because it wasn't YOUR version , you bastardized one of he greatest masterpieces of horror on film to date ! ! Was it worth disappointing your millions of fans just to uplift your own ego ? Frankly , had I the money to invest , I would back a multi-million-dollar budgeted Dean Koontz film . Perhaps " Dark Rivers of the Heart , " " Night Chills , " or " Darkfall . " But NOT a toned-down weak-ass version of one of the greatest movies ever made . Remakes are supposed to BETTER the attempt , not lessen it . This movie rates a - 0 - from the Fiend because it is the most grotesque , atrocious , despicable piece of garbage EVER MADE ! ! : .
558805	2626332	120029	1.0	Painful To Watch	I'm in the minority on this , but I really disliked this film . I generally like to watch Harland Williams . Typically , he's a fine straight man , but sometimes , his dry wit shows through . In Rocketman , however , he has allowed himself to be reduced to sophomoric antics worthy of any SNL reject ( and I say that with all due respect ) and appears to belong in a Rob Schneider movie . Quite frankly , this was too painful to watch . The character wasn't funny . He was pathetically moronic . . . sad . . . not funny . This has been heralded as awesome , and hilarious , but neither is this funny , nor is it awe inspiring . It's just stupid , with no redeeming qualities whatsoever .

I'm virtually in shock that this movie has received a 7 . 1 ( for now ) rating here at IMDb , making it the most over-rated piece of detritus in the Disney vaults . I must say it is THE single worst Disney presentation I've ever seen . I'd come to expect bad animation and horribly neglectful illustrations from Disney sequels , but this was no sequel ; it was a feature film ! We saw what could be done through CGI with Monsters , Inc . , A Bug's Life , Finding Nemo , etc . This is more the quality I would have expected at the very beginning of the CGI age , not presently .

558845	2626332	70122	1.0	Oh My Gods this is dismal !	This travesty of a movie opens with a gay couple ( ? ) ( Don't get me wrong . I'm not anti-gay . I'm anti-bad movies . ) watching the most annoying kid in the whole world while he rides some idiotic-looking dolphin shaped paddle thingy on a lake ( ? ) . When the water begins to shimmer and drain , thereby endangering this horrid little demon spawn of a kid , the couple can't think of anything better to do to save him than shoot a spring loaded harpoon at him ( the kid ) ! ! ! Unfortunately for the audience , they missed killing him and saved him from being sucked into the lake ( ? ) . Meanwhile , Megalon , a giant flying roach ( ? ! ) is sent up to the surface to discipline those naughty humans who insist on firing their nuclear testing warheads into the water and thereby screwing up their kingdom so cleverly named " Seatopia . " major eye rollings ensueThe final bout features the Big G and his pal , the inflatable robot Ultraman . ( No , due to international copyright , he's NOT Ultraman . He's Jet Jaguar . But we must RUN like he's Ultraman ! - - thanks Austin Powers 3 ! ) versus Megalon ( the cockroach thingy ) and Gigan . I rate this as the most IRRITATING Big G flick . The plot is an annoying attempt at an action / adventure story that has little ( if anything ) to do with the monsters , the Big G gets a wall-eyed cartoony costume , the annoying brat's dubbed-in voice is a nerve-wracking fanny-smacking whine , the monsters ' fight scenes look like a gang of schoolyard dorks picking on each other , and the music is some gawdawful cacophony that sounds like it was performed by the director's tone deaf ADHD-suffering " help me I'm on meth-amphetamine and I can't help myself " nephew . The budget for this one was obviously just a bit of left-over cash from some other project , as the sets were minimal . They actually reused city destruction footage originally used for Ghidrah ( ! ) and some of the fight footage , if you can BELIEVE IT , was recycled from Godzilla vs Gigan . Next to Godzilla's Revenge , this is the nadir of the series . All that having been said ; however , this was a fun movie . Its target audience was obviously 8-12 year old boys and that shows ; boy does it show . This is one of those fun movies where the Big G jumps around like a crack-addicted butt-monkey and acts like he's got some martial arts abilities but is too afraid he'll show up his tag team partner , to demonstrate his talents . The cockroach-thing made Me laugh when I first saw this ages ago , and I found that it still makes Me laugh . As do the sheet-wearing Seatopians who were decidedly NOT Japanese . LOL Crazy stuff . Just crazy stuff . on the " B " Scale . I don't know if that even registers on the " A " scale . If it does , it's certainly not over a from . . . the Fiend : .

Having studied this period well , I was shocked to see the historical inaccuracies and fictionalized events this work attempted to tout as " true . " It is alarming to think that people actually attempt to learn their history from any religions or cinematic source ! What happened to the age when we all read and studied for ourselves , rather than listening to the corner gossips , which is all this " work " amounts to . This is so over-christianized that it takes itself so seriously as to attempt to beat their ugly lies into anyone who would dare watch . This was a complete lie .

559149	2626332	78767	1.0	Because We Believed . . .	When this movie was first released in 1979 , I saw it in the theaters . It is not a bad little slice of the entertainment cheese , but it was unfortunate that they had to lie to make it hit . On the big screen , and at home ( alone hiding under the covers in my bed reading the book late at night ) , it was an immensely scary venture into the world of the vengeful poltergeist . The main element which made this attempt more frightening than it really was , was the ( then accepted ) fact that this work centered around true events . It was sold to the world as a " True Story . " As it turned out , the only events which were true were the gruesome murders which were perpetrated before the Lutz's had ever heard of the house ; and that the Lutz's , the house , and Amityville all exist . The events which happened to the Lutz's described both in the book and the film , were lies . It was proved in court that the writer , " took ( generous ) liberties , " with the truth . Had this movie been released as fiction , it would not have left those of us who were truly frightened by the implications of this work , feeling betrayed and would still have a somewhat decent following today . We were able to overlook the horrid cinematography , the cheesy dialog , the plastic acting , and the obvious bad timing of delivery throughout this movie because we BELIEVED . We forgave it all because we were told it was a true story . It couldn't be the writer's or the director's fault because it wasn't a contrived plot ; it was real ! Now , we know it's all just a lie , and I ( frankly ) have no stomach left for it . Now , they're doing a remake . Frankly , I can understand a remake . It is horribly dated , and awful . It NEEDS a remake . But to perpetuate a lie ? I think not . There are far more worthy films in the studio vaults than this . Perhaps this newest generation of " young adults " will buy into the lie just like we did but for their sakes , I hope not . This rates a from . . . the Fiend : .

Not even a toad ; just a frog . He's reminiscent of about a hundred other no-talent hacks who churn out one useless crap-fest after another . This movie ? Is a crap-fest . Slater's talent is only minimally utilized leading one to believe he's got other things ( like his failed relationship ) on his mind . Reid performs as if she has either forgotten her acting lessons , been severely hit on the head and MADE to forget her acting lessons , or has one of the worst directors in the history of film . I'm voting on the third choice , myself , although the other two are always possible . Uwe Boll has never done a single thing from which I've derived even the slightest pleasure . Frankly , I'm satisfied that he made this stinker . I was concerned with Bloodrayne competing with " Underworld : Evolution " for ticket sales . Now , I'm confident that Len Wiseman has nothing , and I mean NOTHING , to worry about . This rates a rating for this messy , convoluted crap-fest , from . . . the Fiend : .

After this dreck , I can only hope he has spent the last 10 years concentrating on his education , and perhaps he can arrange a come back in his late twenties . Otherwise , this film still offers few redeeming qualities , and little to no entertainment value . Three brothers journey into the wilderness to help Marty initiate his nature film-making career . Sounds mildly interesting , doesn't it ? Let me be the one to warn you , it is not . The " fun " scenes herein are the most idiotic form of popular tripe , and the suspension of belief required here is wholly impossible . This is just terrible .

559102	2626332	106156	2.0	Deplorable attempt	Yet Another Prime Example Of What NOT To Do To A Stephen King NovelThis was not the best Stephen King novel to begin with , but I enjoyed the depth of character and the intricate detailing of small town life in Maine . The character development was exemplary and the writing of this novel was very well done . The premise behind the whole story was that we , Human Beings , are the aliens . Wonderful , thought-provoking and disturbing . What they DID to this story with this , another Made For TV Adaptation of the book , was rob the story of the depth of the character development and eradicate the small town feeling of community and family that you got from the book . Which left . . . absolutely NOTHING . The effects are of the pre-Star Wars days , the cast is the most miss-matched combination of miss-cast actors you've ever seen and the performance of the key characters ( Bobbi and " Gard " ) is sadly mis-directed , plasticly hollow and miserably lacking .

559154	2626332	329717	2.0	Obvious , blatant info-mercial for Indiana Jones 4 ! ! !	Okay . So Harrison Ford , who is now in his early 60's as of this writing , is planning on doing another Indiana Jones sequel . Indiana Jones 4 , which is replete with problems , postponements , and a problematic script . But is he still capable of pulling off the lead in an action / adventure ? If " Hollywood Homicide " is any indication , I would have to vote a resounding , " NO ! " Ford portrays a cop / real estate agent who is partnered with Josh Hartnett who is a cop / actor . Now , with a supporting cast like that , what could go wrong ? Well , I'm not a fan of Hartnett's work . H20 was awesome , but frankly , that's the only thing he has ever done which even remotely caught my attention , although he has enjoyed a smattering of successes ( The Faculty , Black Hawk Down , The Virgin Suicides , etc ) . The movies were decent , but I've never liked him IN them . But I digress . This was supposed to sell the target movie audience on Ford's ability to still believably portray an action hero . Well , it did just the opposite , in my opinion . In this movie , Ford falls down ( ! ) SIX times , is slower than usual ( face it , he's never been a fast mover ) , and actually manages to behave like he is older than his early sixties . His lines are poorly delivered , and he appears distracted from the already distracted character he attempts to portray , as if he is trying to read cue cards while wearing bad glasses . I had hopes for the newest installment of Indiana Jones , but this has dashed them into oblivion . This movie , in itself , is simply detestable . I liked the plot and the dialog , but the acting here was far below par . The " action " was more like watching geriatrics play kick-ball out on the back lawn of the nursing home .

This has been touted as " delightful , " but I found the horrible events which occur , pretty sad . I can laugh at another's misfortune but this just wasn't funny .

They are both quite wonderful in this film . The story was decent , but the execution of the story was convoluted . In spite of that , the main problem is casting . I mean . . . Heather Graham ? She's good for some things , but her presence in this production is NOT a plus . And Lacey Chabert ? Not only did she make the character aggravating , but her performance was horrid . I normally would not trash a child's performance , but like Courtland Mead in Stephen King's authorized version of The Shining , Lacey Chabert is whiny , superfluous , and inept . The effects of Spider / Smith are cheesy and obvious CGI . I don't mind even a heavy use of CGI , but it MUST be done with skill , or it destroys much of the work . But here , it barely even mattered . The casting , the story , and the execution were pretty awful . So what was good here ? Believe it or not , Matt LaBlanc . He was a surprising wild card who contributed something actually noticeable . . . in a good way . Gary Oldman did the best he could with the dismal elements surrounding him , and again , Jack Johnson stole the show . He was a sheer delight . The sappy ending will no doubt touch you , but it feels more like a molestation than the warm fuzzy hug it is intended to be . This was set up so that it could have been great , but in the end it is a total failure in the way of execution ; the insane casting choices , and pointless meandering story line killed it .

While Vincent Price's performance is nothing less than his usual brilliance , this movie just didn't make the cut . Night of the Living Dead , an obvious rip off of this movie , while much better done , had the obvious advantage of having this work from which to spring board itself . If it did nothing more than spawn the Romero run of Zombie flicks , it did its part in the field of horror .

This was billed as a comedy , but this is NOT a comedy . It is more a character study than anything else , and as such , I cannot say it was even well made , despite my understanding of the marketing problems , which occurred . Murray is way off his game here . They say he tried something new and did well at it . I say , regardless of his trying something new , he stunk UP the place , and should have been pulled from this project . I LIKE Murray , but his dialed-in performance did nothing to further endear , and did a lot in the way of putting me off him . There ARE a few elements which make this worth watching . Owen Wilson is great , and comes off more like the Bill Murray that Murray fans grew to love and have become disgruntled with in the past decade or so . Scarlett Johanssen was another element which made this viewable . She is a delight as a neglected newlywed who forms a weird bond with an egocentric aging actor ( well , at least the typecasting worked for Murray ) . Anna Farris is also present , but you only see her for a few moments . All in all ? I can not for the LIFE of me understand how this won an Oscar ! I was bored , bored , bored . The performances were stilted , the dialog delivery was halting and unconnected , and the overall feeling of the film itself was like something out of the late 1970's , but perhaps that last item was the catalyst int hat Baby Boomers bought into it . I am not sure what happened to boost the overall appreciation for this crap , but I cannot say I enjoyed anything about it beyond Scarlett Johanssen and Owen Wilson , and then only marginally , as neither the script , nor the execution , was anything to crow about .

Jennifer Lopez frankly reeked , as did Ice Cube . John Voight was good , but not up to par , in my opinion . There are some excellent action sequences , and some decent and funny dialog , and the story flows with an adequate pace . The effects , especially those of the snake itself , are really quite good , and show an inspired use of that $35M budget . My favorite scene ? There is a shot from the ground , of a guy jumping from an extreme height . Just as you think , " Yeah ! He's gotten away ! " the anaconda comes out of nowhere and snatches him right out of mid-air . That was impressively shot and executed , and was ( in my opinion ) the highlight of the whole movie . It is considered a " B " movie , yet carried a $35M budget ? ! How , by any consideration , does that qualify this movie as a " B " flick ? That's an " A " budget , and so it will be rated as such . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
559092	2626332	349683	4.0	Interesting But Superfluous and Unimaginative .	I realize I am in the minority here at IMDb ( on many occasions ) , but it behooves me to say that . . . While this film was adventurous and gritty , I had several problems with it . . . there is little chance Knightly's character would have been given the opportunity to demonstrate her fighting skills by all accounts , Merlin ( Merwyn , M . . . there are too many variations for me to list them ) was a force to be reckoned with when it comes to the Arthur of legend ( not to be confused with the Arthur of historical significance ) , he was the Constantine of his little corner of the world in that he had to decide whether or not his people , for all time , would be Christian or Pagan they left out every trace of Magick and ShamanismNow , I personally want a little magick in my myth , as that is the way they were written . What does it matter whether it is historically accurate to say that Mherline ( just another spelling of , " Merlin " ) was a Magick User of great global significance , or not ? ! Why tamper with the story so severely that it completely changes the very essence of that myth / legend ? Because it was NOT done with a loving care to the legend , this movie utterly fails to capture the imagination and lift the viewer out of the daily routine . I found myself going over the grocery list in my head during this movie ! Some have touted this work to be " historically accurate . " Feh ! There is not enough history to support ANY version of the King Arthur legend . We know he existed , but beyond that , there is not enough substantiating evidence to go one way or the other . MY King Arthur was surrounded in Pagan beliefs and Traditions . I don't care for THEIR King Arthur , who was written and portrayed to have been a low-life robber-knight rather than a King of great legend and heart . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
559048	2626332	113492	4.0	Cheesy and Glib , But Still Fun If You Like Blockbustery Popcorners	Judge Dredd was a terrible attempt at a comic book movie . Superman fared well for the first couple of movies , and the Burton Batman line did okay for the first couple of installments , and Judge Dredd does hold potential for a successful franchise line . However , this was done well before the current technological CG age , and it shows something awful . The dialog is trite and glib , delivered with about as much reality as plastic , and comes off like they were trying SO hard to have fun that they couldn't actually have any , if you can understand that . Coupled with the fact that this work takes itself far too seriously , Stallone in particular considering he was the ONLY serious thing about the work , Stallone comes off as an over-dramatized ego maniacal schmuck . A . Asanti does portray a competent villain , and Stallone contributes a decent performance , all things considered . I think it was more . . . everything else , that went wrong with this production . . . Rob Schneider , for one . Whose idea WAS it to cast that moronic imbecile in a Judge Dredd movie ? Is it possible that some idiot considered him the comic relief ? ! Not possible when one realizes that Rob Schneider is about as funny as a bad case of syphilis . He drug it down , if that is possible . The set designs were another thing . The budget existed to have built good sets , but these looked worse than some of the original Star Trek episodes ' sets and props ! In places , it looked good , but for the most part , they were pretty cheesy . Blend that with Stallone's over-acting , and trite dialog , Rob Schneider's presence , and everyone else just milling about as if there was no point to the plot , and you've got a pretty bad movie . Fun , but still pretty bad . The sound track and the plot ( when it is discernible ) are the only enjoyable elements of this work . Unless you're a die hard Stallone fan , I'd suggest you pass on this one . If you're a fan of the comic book series , do yourself a favor and reread the books . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .

The performances are . . . okay , but was it really necessary to use 30 minutes ' of screen time to show the woman bouncing on the horse , trying to smile , in slow motion ( notice I said " trying to smile " ) ? ! Some may have been enchanted by this work , but frankly , I found it anything but . I was bored , and checking my watch less than halfway through this one , which is unusual for me .

ONLY a bit , but a bit , nonetheless . Now that I've said that , let me get on with my review . . . We'll start with the animation . . . no , I don't have the strength . We'll temporarily skip over that aspect and move on the the creation of the characters . Oy . I don't think I have the heart . The direction . . . we'll talk about the direction . It was . . . sighs . . . nonexistent ? I'm a Star Wars fan , and have been since I first saw Luca$'s epic on the big screen back in " the day , " but this acorn has fallen FAR FAR from the tree . The animation . I expected something of quality . This is ILM . . . Luca$film . . . for crying out loud ! But what we were subjected to in theaters was nothing short of ghastly . The work was so far from the quality fans have come to expect ( and rightfully so ) from Luca$ that I had to check into whether or not he farmed this project out to another production company . Nope . It was Luca$film Animation . So it's in stone . . . There's no excuse for this . I wanted to love the story , but I couldn't . It is so riddled with the pockmarks of " gearing up for the Cartoon Network series , " that it bore no qualities above that of the cheapest , most shoddily done , children's Saturday Morning cartoon . The subsequent series to follow may serve to give Star Wars fans more story between Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith , but frankly , I'm not ready to say that the payoff is worth the price . It was painful to watch , considering some of the less desirable elements including ( but in no way limited to ) horrible animation , choppy ( at best ) direction , no flow of story whatsoever , a young female padewan we've never seen before ( other than in fan fic garbage ) , a storyline which strays radically from the formula , characters cut directly from cardboard with a cookie cutter , and . . . did I mention this is some really BAD animation ? All in all ? This was a muddled mess , and I feel dumber for having watched it . Do something else . This wasn't worth my time , and chances are , unless you have no discrimination whatsoever where Star Wars is concerned , it won't be worth yours , either .

If this is a slump , I hope he pulls out of it SOON , and stops remaking his own works ! OY Vey ! After the Scream trilogy , wherein Craven insists that we fans of the slasher genre completely abandon the " slasher rules " and embrace his 3 part series , we find Craven asking us to embrace them , once again and accept Cursed , as is . Unfortunately , Cursed is itself Cursed . This work is utterly devoid of heart . There is nothing about the characters which emotionally invests the movie goer . I've found little or no character development , and very little in the way of an attempt to rectify that situation through development of story , execution , or anything else . It was dismally disappointing , after all the press this work received leading up to it . Even now , in 2007 , well after the initial release , even when viewing the Unrated Edition with more footage and a better score , I cannot fully enjoy this work .

This work does make the attempt to be suspenseful and entertaining . But it could have ( should have ) been so much more . One of the most popular of the " come-back kids , " John Travolta has exhibited extraordinary talents as a thespian , and has made some of the most unfortunate choices concerning what projects with which he associates himself . An actor ( among other staff members ) has to have complete faith in his / her director to produce a better than adequate finished product . It would seem as though Mr . Travolta has faith in just anyone . This director has a " spotty " reputation , at best . But in a field where the " hit and miss " ploy works more often than not , it appears that this just was not Mr . Travolta's turn . While his performance is stellar , he appears to be the only participant who has any idea what is going on . There is some element of suspense , but that element is broken too many times ; the spell is shattered , leaving the viewer disillusioned with no atmospheric redemption and this work as nothing more than average .

558726	2626332	116778	4.0	Not Much Of Anything , And Too Arrogant In What It Is .	Woody Harrelson and Randy Quaid are tragically funny in this vehicle wherein a washed up , one-handed participant of the national bowling circuit recruits an Amish farm-boy nobody to help him pull various scams to get to a bowling tournament in Reno with a million dollar payoff , all unbeknownst to the Amish nobody . Harrelson is the star , with Bill Murray taking the part of his competitional nemesis . Harrelson actually surprised me with his performance herein . I do not know what I expected really , but his performance surpassed those unknown expectations . Randy Quaid is so not Amish that it was amusing watching him as a man who is not Amish , trying to pretend to be Amish , convincingly , and not . But he did not mean to be convincing . It's merely the tenor of his performance which makes you half buy into his Amishness ( if you can dig it ) . The weakest element here was Bill Murray . I hate to say that , as I have been a fan for thirty years , or so , but he is not nearly as great as his ego makes him believe , and his arrogance in this vehicle lost its humor when the character's megalomania too closely approached his own , thereby rendering the character a non-character in my book , and negating his performance as a performance . All in all , this is amusing , but not highly so , and is seriously overrated by the users here at IMDb . " The greatest comedy of the 90's " it isn't ! It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .

Yeah , sure , okay she died in the first movie , but c'mon ! Rename the movie or something . Jeez ! They could have , at least , allowed her more screen time in the capacity in which she - was - utilized . This was dark and edgy ; as much so as the first . Emily Perkins carries her role as Brigitte quite well and with some beautiful style . Most of the major plot elements still intact , this attempt runs seamlessly . Once you discover what Ghost really IS and what she has been up to with her Aunt , you begin to see the movie in a totally different light . On the second viewing , you see the treachery and the beguiling in those cunning little eyes , but on the first viewing , we knew there was something up with Ghost and her aunt . This was not quite as clever nor was it as fresh as the first , but then again , it was as good as it could have been without Katharine Isabelle . That is in no way saying that Emily Perkins isn't delightful . She is bright , beautiful and capable . I look forward to her future endeavors with great anticipation . This just should have been entitled something with " Ghost " in it , as she was the main character in this attempt , rather than Ginger OR her sister Brigitte . As a stand alone movie , it was really quite entertaining . There were some nice plot twists and strong characterization . However , as a sequel to Ginger Snaps , I found it was somewhat lacking .

559255	2626332	97659	5.0	Responsible Martial Arts Flick Receives Bad Marks	Van Damme wrote this story to demonstrate that it takes a long long time to achieve the level of expertise that one needs in order to compete in a contest such as featured herein . The lion's share of film time is devoted to the rigorous training Kurt ( Van Damme ) receives in preparation of the upcoming bout with Tong Po . The story begins in the beginning , takes a hiatus to demonstrate the instruction necessary to get to the climax , and then runs straight into the climax . The problem is that most casual martial arts fans don't CARE about the training or character development . They just want action action action and then in the ending finale , they want action , with maybe a little story thrown in . If that is what you're after , this isn't that kind of film . This also isn't an intelligent film or anything Oscar-worthy , but if you want your teenager to see what is required to hone those tai kwan do classes into something real and formidable , plug this one in and explain the level of dedication one must invest to achieve that goal . If for no other reason , watch it for that . I don't know . I can't really say this is the most enjoyable of Van Damme's work . Frankly , I liked Cyborg and Bloodsport much more .

558922	2626332	74258	5.0	Although The Title Is A Misnomer , The Elements Are Greater Than Apparent On First Viewing	This work is horribly outdated , and that seems to be a prevalent feeling throughout the duration of the film , however , when one views this production , one realizes that many modern ( or at least newer ) horrors have borrowed heavily from this attempt . I have to include spoilers to demonstrate my point . Sorry . The isolation of the house and the rambling size , and the fact that the family arrives in a station wagon with a young son named Danny in tow , were all used again in 1980 by Kubrick in his adaptation of Stephen King's The Shining . The element of the father driven insane by the spirit of / in the house is seen again in Kugbrick's The Shining and The Amityville Horror . The Celtic TriQuetra trim around the doorway , the atrium full of dead plants which come back to life when new people come to live , and the fact that the house repairs / builds itself were heavily borrowed by King's later work , Rose Red . and . . . This work quotes other horror movies much like Craven's 1996 Scream trilogy . This also feels somewhat like Hitchcock's Psycho , in the end , although there is little to NO suspense generated , and the principal character is NOT a serial killer , possessed or not . The title is a misnomer in that the story is not that which the title would indicate . Oh , it is , but only symbolically . The family members are the " burnt offerings " made to the house , in order for the house to maintain and renew itself periodically , although they aren't burned , they ARE offered as sacrifice to the house . For so many elements to have been cannibalized over the years , one may be tricked into thinking there must be something here not visible upon first viewing . However poignant these independent elements are , however , when combined in THIS work , they simply are not as effective as they should have been . Some of the later attempts named herein were more effective , and more fun . This was one of the less dramatic portrayals in Bette Davis's repertoire , however there was one scene in which she grows confused concerning the heater in Danny's room , which demonstrated a glimmer of the Bette Davis we all love so well . All in all ? If you're interested in seeing where many of the more modern movies came from , this is definitely one you'll want to see . If not , then it offers little in the way of genuine entertainment , unless you'd like to see Oliver Reed in one of the most overblown ( over the top ) performances of his career . His portrayal belies his lack of classical training , as he comes off as a disgruntled Shakespearean actor . This wasn't that great , but contributed to some greatness along the way .

For whatever reason , I have always enjoyed a great fascination with the world's volcanoes . I have studied Strombolli , Pompeii , Vesuvius , Herculanium , Hawaii , Yellowstone , and Mt . St .

559062	2626332	85333	5.0	Sub-standard King adaptation	While this - is - a good movie , it qualifies as one of the many truly bad King adaptations . Mainly , there is no mention whatsoever of Lebay , focusing rather , on Christine . While , in my opinion Carpenter did about the best he could have with that book , I guess . . . it is definitely worth a mini-series remake . The book was so much more in-depth , so much richer , fuller , and had so much more substance than this movie , even though this is still a very enjoyable and creepy film . But with another director's name in the title ( or even in the subtitle ) , such as " Kubrick's The Shining , " and so on , it's ripe for being remade . Mr . King doesn't seem to particularly appreciate sharing the by-line , even if he has to ruin a superior film , as in the same production I just referenced , to correct that condition . The premise of this story is good : a nerdy , unlovable , moronic dweeb buys a car which is a rolling piece of junk , invests far too much time and money into it for lack of a life , and feeds so much of his energies into the car , that he causes the dark spirit of the car to become reanimated , even as the entity contained within the car , possesses him . This is a pretty good plot line which , unfortunately , was far superior on paper than this endeavor on film . However , without comparing the movie to the book , the movie is quite enjoyable . I've recently watched this one again , keeping in mind not to do the comparing thing , and the movie does stand alone quite well . My suggestion is , as always with King , watch the movie first .

The acting quality was a bit better here , as was the production quality and story line , but the finished product left me wondering why they bothered ? This played like a series of random scenes with the same actors , spliced together with no obvious intent , while at other times , it promised you a good story , but lost its way after a few lines . All in all , it was quite disappointing . What was so disappointing is that it had the potential to be a great movie and a superior sequel . SPOILERS HERE ! ! The premise of a cult of Lycan Magick Users is an awesome idea , which was utilized here , but the execution was slow , and just died somewhere after the first opening scenes . And there were immense blocks of dead film ; scene after scene where there was no action , no character development , no continuity of story . . . nothing . There was too much T & A here , and it in no way enhanced this endeavor , nor did it help hide the fact that the director had little to no idea what he wanted to do with this script . That was a shame , and it shows with the complete lack of continuity between the scenes . Either that , or the editor needs to be shot .

Well , the producers of the original obviously had no interest in a sequel to their masterpiece , as they rid the world of the magickal scroll , and disintegrated the Mummy himself . How selfish . Now the producers had to start all over again , this time , using tana leaves to resurrect the ancient evil ( Tom Tyler ) , in place of the destroyed scroll . This is not a remake , but rather , a deserving sequel , even without Karloff's presence , though I missed him here immensely . Mr . Tyler's portrayal was . . . well , not Karloff's , and it really shows . However , this was a good strong story which generates an eerie , creepy atmosphere with solid portrayals , a well-paced story and well-placed dialog . The soundtrack contributes to the atmospheric qualities in a way that heightens the suspenseful feel of the whole production . Wallace Ford lends to this work the comedic relief as the perfect balance to the dark , horrific atmosphere generated by the Mummy and those awesome sets . For 1940 , these sets are highly detailed and truly awe-inspiring if one can but look beyond the black and white , and see the richness beneath . Very nicely done .

RATATOULLE lacks soul , heart , and frivolities , which normally draw children and adults alike by the droves . This film is a romantic sort , as are most Disney animated features , with the Comedy factor omitted from the formula this time , and the movie suffers for it . It was only moderately interesting and somehow managed to be quaint without endearing itself to its target audience . Some adults will particularly like this due to the adult themes and elements , but the age group who are out there attempting to make it on their own like the lead character in this work , will not be attracted to this venue . This sad fact is negated ; however , by the fact that this film did only marginally less at the box office , than the widely loved ( and vastly superior ) Cars . It is further negated by the fact that RATATOULLE receives a user rating here at IMDb . com , which surpasses Cars by laps . Deservedly so , in my opinion . RATATOULLE is a wonderful film , but it lacked the magic of the rest of its line . All in all ? I sincerely hope this does not turn out to be the beginning of a trend into decline .

Okay , I liked this movie , but like Roland Emmerich's Godzilla , it shouldn't have been a namesake movie . As a great kid's movie empowering young ladies with the desire to become more intelligent and capable , this is a fantastic step . BUT . . . as a Nancy Drew movie , I can't endorse this endeavor .

I'm not into dramas so I can't say I enjoyed this as much as most who would bother to review it . Aside from that , however , I find this well written , affectionate , and in possession of heart and soul . Helen Hunt is sweet and natural in her portrayal , but then again , I usually DO like her . This work is entirely story driven , and , as a result , spends a lot of time on character development , story enriching sub-plots , and an elevated overall execution of the dramatic element . Nicholson is as good in the dramatic roles as he ever was . His adroit dramatic talents are what make his horror / action attempts so good . This movie is supposed to teach you that love and matters of the heart should rule the day . For me , though , it seems to have missed its mark . It seems to me that without money , the " miracles " of this film could not have taken place . So rather than teaching that heart is the answer , it teaches that money is the answer , for without money , nothing Nicholson's character wanted to do for ANYone would have been possible .

558607	2626332	327162	6.0	The Stepford Wives Remix .	This review contains spoilers for both this movie , and the original , " The Stepford Wives . " Even a horror comedy can have a cohesive story line . This story is more than convoluted . It's bastardized . It's completely lost . Don't get me wrong , I LOVE this movie . It's fun and it's funny , and there are some strong moments between Kidman and Broderick . Everyone put in good performances . But the direction was non-existent . I mean , come on . They didn't transplant the brains into robotic bodies . They simply couldn't make up their minds as to what they wanted to DO . So we ended up with a horrible mess . A fun mess , but still a mess . I totally believe that whole transplant device was invented after the fact and was never a part of the original storyline . I read the reviews and movie news and this movie was plagued with problems . Script problems , personality problems , emotional problems , set problems ; you name it . And it definitely shows . In the original movie ( don't know , don't care who saw it ) , the wives were murdered in pure cold blood , and replaced by robots . In the remake , they wanted a lighter theme than the cold-blooded murder of these women , so after filming the women like they were going to be robots , they began shooting them like they were altered , rather than replaced . In the remake , they wanted desperately for the women to be able to be " changed back , " to be given their minds again . They wanted to redeem the male species of these atrocities of the original work , and thereby , they ruined their whole effort . The story got more than lost between all the arguing between producers and staff , etc . and this hodge-podge is what we got stuck with . They cut the Bette Middler / lawnmower scene because they changed their story line half way through the movie and no longer wanted to portray her as THAT robotic , but more " altered " instead . It didn't work . Once they gave us a human ATM machine who was controlled with her own personal remote , it was too late to turn around and sell the audience on the whole watered-down chips-in-the-brain premise ( which was lame as all H3LL anyway ) , and expect us to buy it . So basically , they just said screw it , slapped it together and handed it to the fans . The movie made no sense because the movie was the first half of one movie , and the second half of a totally different movie . They should have sacrificed some of the low-brow humor for a more intelligent pass on this film , IMO . Had they had the cajones to actually " ring the bell " ( by killing off the wives as in the original ) with this attempt , the Bette Middler / Lawnmower scene could have been left in and this movie would have made a lot more fans happy . The one thing I did find refreshing was the inclusion of the first gay Stepford couple . It's about time Hollywood moved in to include everyone and not just the purely redneck , white bread , mainstream , over-christianized Americans . Nice touch . Too bad the rest of the movie wasn't as progressive . Although I highly recommend watching the original over this one , it's still a fun endeavor , however , and rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
558850	2626332	253556	6.0	Inept screen writing drags Reign into the mud	Frankly , For $95M , I Expected More . . . Like Perhaps Some Resemblance of a Script ? ? I really do not know what these people were thinking . I looked and I read a $95 M budget for this movie ? ! Obviously , this immense budget was directed towards the effects , because the acting lessons and screen play were terribly neglected . The premise has mankind involved an " Independence Day " type conflict . It's them or us . This time , " They " are the denizens of Dragon Kind . The dragons featured in this movie are fire-breathers who feed on humans for sport . They are also " western " dragons , for those of you who know the difference , and extremely well done . I was so impressed with the DRAGONS ! Mankind vs Dragons in an all-out war for the world . The possibilities were endless and I was very excited about seeing this on the big screen . The dragons featured are Black Dragons . Fire-breathers , as I mentioned before ; meat-eaters . Black Dragons were the perfect choice for this scenario , as this is how they are portrayed through legend to have behaved . Good thing for us there never were more than a few in existence at a time , or this could very well have been a history lesson . sighs So much for the studio hype . Unfortunately , the wonderful black dragons featured here are all there is to be impressed - with - in this attempt . The story is riddled with huge plot holes and the worst kind of contrivances . That , and the utterly infantile dialog were enough to send me home even though I had read the critic reviews concerning the serious lack of action . Because of those reviews , I was really looking forward to an ? intelligent ? thought-provoking film . I thought that finally there has been a great movie done with realistic Dragons and no comic book feeling to it ( by that comment , I refer to Dungeons and Dragons ) , when in reality this was a total waste of $95 M and nearly 2 hours of my life . Another minor problem I had with this movie was in the musical score . It sounded to me like it was written for an original episode of Cannon or Barnaby Jones . Then there was the gratuitous socio-phallic American-bashing . I'm sick of hearing that crap . The contradictions and plot holes are blatantly obvious to anyone who's seen the movie , so I won't bore you with them . To say that the plot was weak would be a gross understatement . The direction was seemingly adequate , when they remembered there were supposed to be Dragons in this movie , that is . There were some almost-creative anachronisms and a few innovations , but nothing worth bothering to mention . If you're looking for a couple hours ' mindless fun , this is it . But for goodness sake , don't go into it expecting anything more than good Black Dragons and just ignore the rest of the trash filling in the time around their scenes . The best story element ; that of the Dragons coming into power , was completely ignored for a non-existent plot line . It rates a , and that's only because the Dragons are great . the Fiend : .
559396	2626332	103956	6.0	Darker , but more hollow .	Did anyone else notice that Chucky has taken on a somewhat Jack Nicholson-esquire-ality about him these days , and perhaps because of that element , we learn right off that we must not fck with the Chuck ! This time , in a military prep school , Andy is the hero , instead of the victim . What I like most about these movies is that they do not attempt to recreate one another . They play like one , long movie , when played back to back . This installment is no exception , and a deserving sequel . However , I somehow did not care for this movie as much as the first two . It is modernized , and they tried a bit bigger budget here , which spoiled the camp of the first two . They tried to add more of the suspenseful aspects of the originals to this one , and in My opinion , they fell a bit short in doing so . It does , however , have a darker feel and there is more gore ( one of the sequel rules ) , but somehow it just falls a little beneath the others . I think perhaps that it is due to the vulgar language used by Chucky . It makes him come of as an obnoxious bad little child , rather than the serial killer / voodoo bocur he was in the first two . It degrades his character's worth and makes it appear superficial , rather than the deeply disturbed psychopath who is trapped in the body of a doll , and is slowly going insane from the frustration given to him by Andy in the first two installments . I mean . . . what guy wouldn't go insane from the total lack of their wedding tackle ? The added darker elements should have made this one a better endeavor , but for Me , there's something missing . But it's still enjoyable , suspenseful , and even tense at times , with a darker atmosphere . from . . . the Fiend : .
558656	2626332	95107	6.0	High Energy Endearing Christmas Fluff .	Fourth best of the Ernest Line . This is just plain silly fun . This isn't the smartest Ernest movie , but then again , none of them are exactly brilliant . They ARE fun , entertaining , and enjoyable , however , and this one is no exception . Something I do find interesting about this work , is the fact that Ernest's Jack Russell Terrier , and many other aspects of this film , seem to return in a wildly successful Carrey vehicle known as The Mask . Ineresting , that . Aside from that , this is a sweet , high energy , endearing bit of Christmas fluff . It isn't my favorite of this category of films , but it is among them .

This ( released in April of 1997 ) was 20th Century / Fox's answer to Universal's Dante's Peak ( released in February of 1997 ) , a superior movie in all ways except one . . . It doesn't have Tommy Lee Jones . I have to say that Jones makes Volcano . Without him , this work would be nothing than an overblown , over-written piece of popcorn trash . As it is , this is a delightful " Mother Nature Gone Awry " flick , with totally kick butt effects . I found it riveting , but liked Dante's Peak more . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
558867	2626332	74285	7.0	One of the few classics to be topped by its remake .	As a Pagan , it's nice to see the christians portrayed as they sometimes are ; pontificating zealots who believe no one is right but themselves ; judgmental nose in the air types who have nothing for anyone outside their own closed-minded views ; even their own family . The abuse Carrie suffers at her pious mother's hands is known throughout the country as rather a common occurrence , and it forever horribly altered poor little Carrie's persona . As a gifted teen in an oppressively religious setting , she doesn't stand a chance . Her mother's failings placed directly on the child's head ; everything the mother went through ; every failure , every weakness , blamed on the child . " Satan will take you away just like he took your father ! " " Oh , Mama ! Everybody KNOWS he left with another woman ! " The scene where Carrie is dragged into the closet and locked inside by her mother is quite dramatic . It actually looks as though Carrie is being PULLED by her hair ! It is also typical of a household in that precarious situation ; living on donations made by those who'd rather pay money than listen to the zealot drone on . The effects were quite nice , but the religious connotations of the movie really just bash you in the head until you're in danger of a coma . Other than Sissy ( Carrie ) ' s performance , the acting was stiff , the teenagers were portrayed by people closer to 30 and the movie really wasn't all that . For a compelling and faithful version of this movie , see the Made4TV remake with Angela Bettis . It's a subtly better work ! This movie gets a from . . . the Fiend : .
559287	2626332	104511	7.0	Darkly fun .	Not the best Vampyre movie ever made , still a fun , humorously dark ride ! I want to start by saying that there are many cameos here worth mentioning . Check the movie's details page for an impressive list of cameo appearances including Frank Oz , Dario Argento ( blah ) , and others . This was a nice combination of mob action and the supernatural . Frank Loggia played Salvatore , a primo mob boss . When he awoke from being bitten , it took a few changes but he quickly caught on to what was happening with him . He understood what his powers should do for him , which made him all the more dangerous . Marie ( played by Anne Parrilaud ) had innocently created him without intent of doing so but still realized that he would become a most powerful menace and that it was her place to put a stop to it . She never intended the romance with Joe ( the lead police officer here ) but once she surrendered to it , it was treated on camera as something almost precious . Very nice . Frank Loggia was excellent in spite of the moments of camp and stiff delivery . He managed to give a talented performance through entire scenes of mafia stereo-types and almost tongue-in-cheek camp . I found the entire production to be a highly entertaining endeavor . I own it . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
558725	2626332	96101	7.0	Lacks the Charm of the First , And Adds in the Area of Superficiality , But It Is Fun , Nonetheless .	" That's what I said , ' Derf ! ' " This installment has Johnny Five in the big city to help Ben get his electronics business off the ground , but since Ben's not around , Johnny Five is left to his own devices , which lead him into the hands of big city bad guys who want to turn Johnny into personal profits . While this work is charming , it lacks the charm of the original . While there seems to be more story , there's really only more dialog , less story , and more superficial fluff . In spite of that , however , this film is marginally entertaining , with some humorous ( if not outright funny ) moments , and serves as a decent distraction . This makes for a decent Sunday afternoon diversion for the kiddies , but the ' rents may wish to find something better to do with their time . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
559140	2626332	122151	7.0	The honest truth about one of the most beloved action / comedy series in the movie industry .	THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR ALL FOUR MOVIES ! ! 1 - was fresh , innovative , edgy and hard . It had everything a good action movie needs to make it successful ; excellent character development , imaginative direction , professional performances by the cast and crew , a clever and witty screenplay with intelligent dialog , and action . . . lots of good fast-paced , well-delivered action . It had a fresh comedic element without ever turning to camp or juvenile antics to solicit a chuckle from us . The comedy was educated , intelligent and expertly-delivered . The characters were lovable , and we got the feeling that we " knew " them , cared about them , wanted them to succeed . Riggs's character felt less like a character and more like a person , due to the high-level of development his character received . True , the " gun handling " left a lot to be desired , but the vast majority of audiences would not realize that you can not get 20 shots from a 16 shot clip . Nor would they realize that you can't just leave those empty clips on the ground ; they cost MONEY and no CoP would do that because law enforcement officers are typically not highly paid . That aside , this was an excellent movie with wonderful entertainment value . One of the best of its kind . 2 - gave us Joe Pesci's character , Leo Getz . Because of Getz , I honestly found this film to be rather endearing . Getz is one of the best characters to have been introduced to this series . Unfortunately , the edge and freshness is toned down way too much , and the action is really rather predictable . I thoroughly enjoyed bearing witness to the further development of the relationship between Riggs and Murtaugh , and was not in the least bored with that aspect . It is still a good movie , even though its edge is shelved for a more " marketable " product . 3 - is just as good as 2 . Riggs now has a new love interest and it seems as though all will be well and all manner of things will be well . It is still a few months away from the press release concerning the Glover / Gibson signing for 4 & 5 , so it seems the series has wound down , rather than up . The action is still quality , though there are fewer and fewer unpredictable moments . The comedic aspect which was enlightened and intelligent is now a bit puerile and tired . And while the performances are still professional , it seems as though Riggs and Murtaugh both are well on their way out . 4 - is the perfect ending to this series . Honestly . The characters have developed as far as I can bear to witness ; Murtaugh misfires his gun in the locker room of the precinct , Riggs gets his butt kicked by a rookie cop in the boxing ring , and Riggs and Murtaugh are both just too old for this action thing anymore . ( Gods help us with 60-something-year-old Harrison Ford in the upcoming " Indiana Jones 4 . " ) Their CHARACTERS speak constantly of being too old , and I'm not talking about Murtaugh's well used line , " I'm getting too old for this sht . " It is far beyond that . And now , with Riggs's marriage to Lorna , Murtaugh's daughter's marriage to Butters , the new babies and all the smarmy crap at the ending . . . enough is just enough . 5 - should never happen . I don't think I can bear to see anymore smarm from these two . The characters we all loved are already gone . Like in " Invasion of the Bodysnatchers , " they've been stolen from us . The edge from Riggs's character is gone . He's a bit hapless now , and sad rather than the lunatic mayhem we want and NEED from his character . The only way to pull off a 5th installment would be to kill off Lorna's character , the baby AND Butters . Either put Riggs back where his character was in 1 & 2 , or don't bring him out of the moth balls . PLEASE . I loved these movies , but for the love of Mike ! NO MORE ! If you liked any of these movies , I highly recommend " Tango & Cash , " an excellent , much-overlooked , highly under-rated " Buddy-Cop " movie . 1 . . . . from . . . the Fiend : .
559221	2626332	102798	7.0	Rickman and Wincott Steal The Show	I don't really like Keven Costner but I like him a far sight better than I do Russel Crowe , and while his movies do tend towards the " revisionist " style , there is something to be said for this version of Robin Hood . I will freely admit the Errol Flynn version is superior in story but this movie has style where it may lack substance . Apparently , Kevin Costner does not know how to pull off a character with such depth and range as Robin Hood . Whether he lacks the ability to interpret the character or just lacks as an actor I have never cared enough to determine but his failings are upheld widely by the team of Alan Rickman and Michael Wincott who absolutely steal the show . This is not to say that this version of the story is without merit . It is worth seeing if only for Morgan Freeman , Wincott , and Rickman . And I'll guarantee you that this version will absolutely SHINE in comparison to Crowe's Nottingham ( due out 2010 ) . Honestly , the only actor MORE wrong for Robin Hood than Kevin Costner is Russell Crowe . Oy . All in all ? This is dark and sweeping . It is fun and entertaining and I LIKE IT !

" Does that mean this is a true story ? Hardly . It says it in plain English . " BASED ON . " That means it contains actual elements , but these elements have been adapted to fit the producers ' ideas of what sells . BASED ON . Not that this movie depicts true occurrences ; but that this screen play contains elements which actually happened . Remember " Amityville Horror ? " BASED ON , not that the entire story is fact . Like . . . the Lutz's , the house in Amityville , and Amityville itself actually exists , and nothing else was real . Get it ? Got it ? Good . moves on to the review . My opinion ? This would have been OH so much better with Harrison Ford in the lead . This is the kind of movie he needs to be doing now that he's just too " mature " for action . Gods help and forfend when he stars in Indiana Jones 4 . Richard Gere was good , even believable , as the " Times " reporter who ends up in West Virginia to do an investigative piece on mysterious happenings there , but Harrison Ford would've been brilliant in this one . Some horror fans are of the mistaken impression that the creature element in this movie is a " new monster . " In fact , this is a very old monster , which has received very little press , so to speak . While this is a very good story which is nicely done and contains some good suspense elements and a lovely plot , it is not a wholly true story , by all accounts , but I enjoyed it , and that's what good entertainment is all about .

558579	2626332	1331335	7.0	Not bad at all !	This is far superior to what I have come to expect from the Sci Fi Channel Originals .

This is superb as far as the Sci Fi Channel movies go , and if this is what we can expect this next generation of SFOs to be like , this should be an enjoyable decade of M4TV Creature Features . Also , it was nice to see Elaine Miles ( Northern Exposure ) again . She always was one of my favorites . This film is a real surprise in the actual film quality , sure , but more so in the quality of performances , dialog , screenplay , and actual plot . . . but what surprises me most ( as if that weren't enough ) is the CGI of the Wyvern .

559467	2626332	80917	7.0	Probably one of the most underrated comedies of its age .	This Feldman production is not the greatest comedy ever made , but Feldman co-wrote , directed , and starred in this Feldman-at-the-Helm vehicle . It truly showcases his talents as no other movie before it had . While it does attempt to do too much , the attempt is not a waste . Feldman merely aimed his sights at Blazing Saddles and made the attempt . It pokes fun at Christians and all organized religion , the pop-culture of the time , contemporary ideologies , the action-driven cop shows of the age , and itself . This is one of those wonderful movies which knows it's a movie and never takes itself too seriously . Feldman is Father Ambrose is the outcast of the monastery . When the archdiocese decides they must have more money from the outside world , or shut its doors , Father Ambrose is chosen to leave the familiar world of hard benches and stone floors , and venture out in search of their salvation . Ironic in that " salvation " is supposed to be their specialty . There are some wonderful cameos by Richard Pryor as God , Andy Kauffman , and Peter Boyle . Along the way , Ambrose discovers what he's been missing out on all those years cloistered in a hermetic order , and processes new information which enables him to rethink his choice from an informed perspective . He finds laughter ; he finds that while men are corrupt , MAN is decent at heart ; and he finds himself . All in all a very endearing , if dated , work . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
559047	2626332	469641	7.0	Not What It Should Have Been	I knew what to expect . I read the reviews before buying this , but it's Cage , so it goes in the collection , regardless . I have to say that this was not what it should have been . While this is a fantastic dramatization of what happens with four rescuers , it fails to tell anything about the actual event itself . Many movie goers were looking for an Oliver Stone's JFK-stylized World Trade Center type drama , and instead we got a look through the microscope rather than a look at the larger picture , as told by the evidence . I think that's what disappointed most audience members with this work . But it's not bad for what it is . It's well written , tense , and triumphant . Cage is completely believable . . . I wouldn't expect any less from him . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
558854	2626332	279112	7.0	Has panache	Wow . What a wonderful experience , to see them update Godzilla yet stay true to form ! The first thing I noticed , and I noticed this right away , was that this was not the Godzilla of my childhood . Thankfully , this also was not Roland Emmerick's " Jurassiczilla , " either . I was stunned and ( at first ) in denial . This was so much better than the Godzilla of my childhood ! It starts out pretty much like any of the older ones . ( The DVD , however , comes with two choices . You can get English-speaking voices with English subtitles , or you can choose Japanese-speaking voices with English subtitles . Personally , I prefer to understand what I'm hearing , but it's cool the other way too . ) But it quickly becomes something more substantial and much better written , produced , directed , and executed . All that having been said , what actually impressed me so with this movie is the effects quality and their treatment of the monsters . Considering they only spent 1 , 200 , 000 , 000 Yen ( approximately $10 , 955 , 902 . 92 US ) , the effects were extremely well executed . I was enthralled with the treatment they gave King Ghidorah . What a spectacular sight ! Not at first , but . . . later on in the movie . The story was easily followed , though not so much so as to put you to sleep . The action sequences were not the kung fu styled cheese of the 60's and 70's . They were strategically orchestrated and executed with that certain Godzilla-like panache . Some Big G purists , however , will tout this as the one we've all been dreading . OH , the movie's great , but this is the TOHO installment which validates Emmerich's Jurassiczilla by including a New York sighting of past Godzilla sightings in the opening , and then later on in the movie a commanding military officer asks , " Why Japan , again ? ! Couldn't he have picked on some other country ? " to much laughter all around the table . The cabinet members ask repeatedly , " Why here ? " as if they have forgotten that Japan is home to the Kaiju , and further cannot seem to recall that Godzilla was their protector for decades . He wasn't always the bad guy . Also , Godzilla is now said to hold the souls of the thousands killed in Japan in WWII , which drags this off the Creature Feature shelf of my DVD collection , and slips it into the Supernatural / Monsters section with the 1930's Universal Mummy and other such collections ; a movie about which I am somewhat conflicted . The set models are as bad ( or as good ) as ever , the field reporters sound like ring-side boxing commentators , and the Big G looks mahvellous in his new makeover . This is obviously due to Emmerick's Western Dragon / Jurassiczilla interpretation , but don't worry Big G fans ; he's bigger , he's better , but most importantly , he's still our Big G , although Emmerich's influence is seen throughout this work in everything from a more complex story , through plot execution , monster concepts , to the superior effects . I previously thought allowing Emmerich to influence this line would be a bad move , but oddly enough , this is the only Godzilla movie in the franchise to receive the same rating as the original here at IMDb ! This venture is as implausible as the rest , but that's one of the things that makes this line so darned fun . The bad dubbing , the cheesy dialog , the obvious models all add to the campy monster fun , but this time , there were some GREAT effects ! They were much better than any previous installment , in my opinion , although the score was enough to drive you buggy ! This time the Big G relies heavily on his laser breath , to devastating affect ! and with the appearance of some of our other Kaiju favorites , this installment is one of the absolute best ! In my opinion , this is by far the best Godzilla movie made ( and I love them ALL ) ! I highly recommend it ! At a Fiendish rating of ( on the B scale ) . That's a solid ( on the A scale ) from . . . the Fiend : .
559363	2626332	316654	8.0	Superior sequel that lacks vitality	Before I start , let me say that I thought Spider-Man 2 was superior in every way to Spider-Man 1 , but one . Honestly , I don't know what it was about Spider-Man 2 that I found lacking . While it was a better movie with excellent effects , great performances , well-conceived plot elements , and beautiful film shots , it still felt " flat " in comparison to Spider-Man 1 . Perhaps it was the fact that Peter had to surrender the mask this time . Or maybe it's that he wants to be with MJ so badly , but can't find the intestinal fortitude to be happy AND a super hero . Or it could be that I expected much more with a $61M budget increase . Whatever the dilemma , apparently it was felt by other movie-goers , since the return for that increased budget was down $23M from the first installment . This was like Superman 2 in that our hero chooses to be an earth-bound human to be with the gal he loves , discovers there's a new menace and immediately regrets his decision . Perhaps that was why it felt " flat . " It's been done . But then again , what hasn't ? This was a superior story with superior effects and action sequences that looked realistically played out rather than the CGI mess that was the first installment . Peter coming clean with Aune Mae was a difficult scene to watch . It was a courageous step on the character's part , and Aunt Mae reacted much the way I expected she would which lent a believable tone to the scene . The villain this time around is done extremely well . Gone is the camp of the first installment's treatment of the nemesis , and enters an age of superior CGI . After Spider-Man 1's Green Goblin , I was frankly reluctant in seeing this chapter . I'm glad , now , that I have . Doc Ock is malevolently beautiful in both design and execution . I thoroughly enjoyed his character . While the first Spider-Man rates a 7 . 4 ( at IMDb ) and received two Oscar nominations and Spider-Man 2 received none ( but strangely , receives a 7 . 9 rating here at IMDb ) the second installment was definitely above the original in every noticeable way . Yet it grossed less with a bigger budget and received no special effects Oscar nominations like the inferior Spider-Man 1 did , which leads me to believe that the lacking element , whatever that may be , affected more than just this movie Fiend .

559261	2626332	118571	8.0	Now HERE is a president I can get behind !	Harrison Ford portrays the true American ideal . He is brave . He is loyal . He is true . Aside from the way Andrew Marlowe wrote the character of James Marshall , Harrison Ford portrays this president with a level of honor and dignity this country has not seen in many , many years . It moves me and touches my patriot heart in ways most other flag-waving flicks can only hope to do . This story is riveting and action-filled , while retaining its quality of a story-driven work with honest and believable dialog . Wolfgang Peterson is a talented director , and his gift shows herein . The element of humanity one finds in the overall execution of the work is inspiring , to say the least . The overall style is not slick , it is gritty . The sentiment is not polished , it is raw . The humanity is not made for public viewing , it is meant for personal consumption . . . for we are people . Do I sound dramatic ? Perhaps because this movie affects me in a way that IS dramatic . I want a James Marshallesque president . Oh yes . I do . This is not for casual viewing . . . at least not for people like me . But regardless of your patriotism , location , or citizenship , this is an excellent action film , even if it does not invoke the same response from everyone that it does from me .

558640	2626332	466909	8.0	Well Done , Effective Remake	You know , when it comes to remakes , directors just can't win . When the change one little thing , fans of the original go nuts . Yet when they fail to make those changes , fans still go nuts and state there wasn't a reason to make a remake , because they didn't change anything . Honestly , in the venue of contemporary remakes , Hollywood just can't win . But let me tell you now . . . This IS a faithful and effective remake . As far as this movie goes , it was far above par and highly exceeded my personal expectations where it was concerned . I have to say that Liev Shreiber is no Robert Mitchem , but he was well above adequate as Damien's Father . Mia Farrow is a darkling joy , and Sir Michael Gambon turns in a brilliant performance . Frankly , Mia and Gambon were the only reasons I bothered with seeing a remake of this worn out old gas station dog of a franchise in the theaters . Otherwise , I would have waited for the extended edition DVD release . This line ( if you don't already know , crawl out from beneath your rock ! ) is based on the Mark of the Beast of biblical myth . I am genuinely tired of the Christian heresy angle . I would much rather see something based on the older systems . But that is neither here , nor there . If you're a fan of the franchise , you won't be disappointed . The action is well paced , the effects are NEVER over the top , and the performances are astounding . That's all I have to say . It rates an from . . . the Fiend : .
559294	2626332	365265	8.0	Stands alone well , but misses the prequel mark .	Obviously , this movie had a little bit bigger budget than the original two . It is better filmed , as the quality of film itself seems to also be better , while it carries with it a fantastic and creative story surrounding the girls ' origins and also their curse . This tale is beautifully told and is well enacted . And there IS a story here . Imaginative , creative , and well written , this production far surpasses the quality of the first two . While it lacks the charm of the first movie , it is successful in capturing at least some of that charisma between the two sisters ; Black and Red . This was an excellent addition to the series , although there was one issue I had trouble with in this installment . I'm having trouble with the fact that Ginger and Brigitte , in the original movie to which this work is a prequel , have no idea with is happening to themselves in the original work . Had they actually lived through the events in the prequel , they would know perfectly well what was going on in the original movie . There would not have been a problem , had they used a continuity editor in the writing / production process of this movie . How is it that Brigitte is no longer a " sister of the blood " in the original movie , and that the original work shows Ginger being bitten for the first time in the park ? It makes no sense . What also makes no sense , is how Ginger and Brigitte could live over 100 years if they weren't Immortal Beings . Other critics have stated that the Ginger and Brigitte of the original story were descendants of THIS Ginger and Brigitte . I don't buy that , as they made no distinction between the two sets of sisters . They used the same expressions and sayings and were , indeed , identical in every way . Therefore , the viewer has to assume that these are the same sisters that were featured in the first movie , who will live from the late 1800's until present time . However , unless their parents were also werewolves , that doesn't wash , either . The Ginger and Brigitte in the original work had parents . Natural parents . Ginger , at one point in " Ginger Snaps , " says , " God , I hate our gene pool , " in reference to their mother thereby negating the " adoption theory " readily believed by some of the franchise fans . So we are left with a huge continuity rift between the prequel and the first movie which fans of this line do not seem to care to notice . That having been said , the effects in this installment were much better than in the first two . The werewolves themselves looked fantastic ; however , the points above left a rather odd aftertaste in the mouth of a true fan of the first two , and did not balance the questions it created with the answers it gave . It lacked the sinister feel the first movie captured . It was dark , yes , just not dark enough to figure in with the rest of the franchise although there were some really nice killing scenes there in the end . Especially nice for splatter fans . Not as good as the other two , but definitely an enjoyable experience . As a prequel to this franchise however , it rates a as it never really explains . . . anything . Though it is slightly better than the first installment . As a stand alone movie , it rates an aggressive on the " B " scale . That's a on the " A " scale from . . . the Fiend : .
559310	2626332	120804	8.0	Resident Evil : A Project in Terror .	To be honest , the first time I saw this , I didn't care for it . It did not follow the story line of the game , and that made me very unhappy with this endeavor . Upon realization that a video game is " dumbed down " for the players to be able to concentrate , however , I opted for a second viewing and came to realize that this was not the waste of time I first believed . I was disappointed with how it played out because there were no cures along the way , they made little notice of records and files lying about , no matter how relevant they were or were not , and the sequence of things was not on par with that of the game . I realize that to do things that way would have severely hampered the flow of the movie itself and would have made it far less active . Considering this is first and foremost , an action movie ( with horror elements ) , that would not be considered a good thing . The truth is that Milla Jovovich contributes a very capable and entertaining presence and performance to this work . Her supporting cast ( every one ) gave nothing but the best they had . The story itself flows quite well and was creatively written and executed . There is nothing wrong with this attempt . It just didn't live up to a fanboy's expectations . Unfortunately , that was their major principal audience ; game fans , and that explains the lackluster box office payoff and the low IMDb user ratings for this attempt . The fanboys were disappointed ; the casual fans casually attended this event ; and the mainstream didn't understand the big deal , either way and so did not participate to a profitable level . With the release of the second installment and all the advertisement and hype Apocalypse received , it drew the mainstream fans a bit harder ; the casual fans were less casual ; and the fanboys were still disappointed , but resigned to the fact that this was just how it was going to be ; take it or leave it . We took it and , in retrospect , embraced the first attempt , as well . It rates an from . . . the Fiend : .
559072	2626332	151738	8.0	Under-rated Barrymore Love Story	I can't say that I embrace this as a Romantic Comedy , as I found little funny about it . I did find it endearing , entertaining , heartwarming , and terminally sweet , and while there were some witty moments , I found them more bittersweet than outright comedic . I liked this one . Barrymore has grown so much as an actress , and it's always wonderful to catch her on the big screen , but this translates well to the small screen , too . In fact , on subsequent viewings , I like this one more and more . If you're a fan of the Romantic Comedy , then you may be a bit put off by lack of comedic effect with this one , but if you're in it for the romance , it's definitely here to be found .

558781	2626332	120587	8.0	Fun family film featuring Woody Allen and Sharon Stone .	I thoroughly enjoy this animation / CGI production , although the quality is not up to par with what we have , today . The main characters are well developed and easy to adopt as focal interest points . The story is quite well-written and delivered , the colors are bright and crisp , and helped to sell the DVD media to the average civilian . Even today , the content is still better than that of , " A Bug's Life , " which just basically has a few characters bouncing one-liners off each other . At least this movie has a STORY ! Woody Allen's character is the star . . . and an Ant . He was classified " worker " as larvae and he's having a few problems with that classification . He feels inadequately judged and pigeon-holed by this assignment , and lets the whole world know it via Allen's nasal whining . There is something better in the world for him , and he is sure he could find and attain it , if only he had the chance . Finally , he realizes that he has to take the chance ; opportunity doesn't come on its own to the normal people . There is a nice sub-plot and a strong main plot ; well developed characters and a star-studded cast of voice and likeness donors in this adventurous and entertaining story . All in all it earns an from . . . the Fiend : .
559254	2626332	102598	8.0	Quirky rom-com manages to entertain .	A cut above " Armed and Dangerous , " A line or two below " When Harry Met Sally . " Romantic comedies will always be a popular medium of expression . Let's face it . It is human nature to share our joys , and our sorrows , and the vehicle of romantic comedy lends to us the ability to do just that . This is , in my opinion , one of the better examples of that vehicle . This one , stars John Candy , Maureen O'Hara , and Ally Sheedy . Ms . Sheedy is really quite good in this attempt ( one of her best performances , in my opinion ) , having been made in the tumultuous post-St . Elmo's Fire and Short Circuit years during which many of the " Brat Pack " faltered and ultimately fell . The premise involves a brow-beaten police officer who is struck by Cupid's arrow the instant he captures the painfully shy funeral home cosmetologist in his sights . But will he be able to overcome the life-long emotional and mental manipulations cast upon him by his overbearing , outspokenly racist , socially retarded mother ? Maureen O'Hara plays Rose , Danny's mother . Her character has the social skills of a leper and the temperament of a rattlesnake with a toothache . I HATE her character , which indicates that it is played extremely well , as I LOVE Maureen O'Hara . This is one of Candy's better films , reminiscent of both " Armed and Dangerous " in the fact that Candy is the straight man here , and " The Great Outdoors , " in that his character is the epitome of the family man , doing everything he can for his family , and looking out for himself last . I enjoy this film , though it is a trifle sad at times . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
559045	2626332	462322	8.0	Grindhouse Tribute Pays Off	Tarantino's films are a bit of an acquired taste . Frankly , most casual movie goers either love him or hate him . I'm one of the few who can take or leave him , but when Grindhouse was announced , I knew I would have to see it . As a tribute to the " B " flicks of the 1970's , this " Grindhouse " feature has been worked until the quality digital media closely resembled the scratched , hair-laden , ill-cut films of the era . I would imagine with today's technology , it took more work to rough it up that badly , than it would have to present a quality modern-day actioner . The idea of the Grindhouse Double Feature is not new , but this work stands as Tarantino's revivalist attempt , and both films were great fun . Planet Terror is a sci-fi horror gore-fest I found delightful . The story was prominent , but did take a back seat to the gore effects , which were mostly make up effects . This was great in that " B " movie kind of way , and even serious movie goers can view this one comfortably as a guilty pleasure and rates a on the " B " scale . Death Proof was the one I was waiting for , personally . Kurt Russell again on the big screen as the tough-guy / bad boy ? Yes ! The stunts here were true stunts , without the use of CGI . The girls in this work were awesome , and it was heartwarming to see Russell back in the role in which the nation came to love him . This one was just plain good , in spite of the " B " movie factor and rates an on the " B " scale . I'd say this attempt was a " HIT . " Here's hoping for Grindhouse 2 . Together , they rate an on the " B " Scale from . . . the Fiend : .
559511	2626332	484562	8.0	Completely Fun	We viewed this work at Movies on the Parkway in Sevierville , TN ; our hometown theater . This film begins with a " folded " feeling not unlike the first Neverending Story in that the boy discovers he is in the story . . . that , indeed , he IS the story . From that point on , it runs like a younger version of The Covenant , with some Harry Potter thrown in . That is not to say this movie felt in any way like a rip-off or a clone of those other movies , but a definite kinship exists - in a good way . This movie stands alone and does not borrow too heavily from any of the aforementioned works . In fact , we found it refreshingly warm and well-written , while managing to demonstrate a tense and edgy element of suspense , but not enough to necessitate strong parental monitoring . I , personally , love the character development in this production via Will's siblings . The family home felt natural and real , as did the children . Especially " Guen . " These child actors will do well if they continue to pursue their careers . All in all ? We found this movie completely fun , well written , and expertly executed . This is a great viewing , regardless of age , but probably not a good choice as a Friday night movie for " the guys , " unless the guys are into young-adult fantasies . It rates a solid from . . . the Fiend : .
559306	2626332	183790	8.0	An odd but satisfying blend	I was doubtful as to the quality of this endeavor , when it first hit the rags . Rock Music featured along with a medieval tale . Hmm . . . Frankly , it didn't sound like a good idea , but I attempted to keep an open mind . The first scene where this phenomenon was displayed , I was still doubtful . We Will Rock You is a great song , and one of my favorites from my youth , but it just did not feel right , considering the setting . But still , I attempted to keep an open mind . The cast was found to be above average in way of performance and the quality of energy they gave to the movie . I will have to stop here to add that Paul Bettany's performance alone ( even had he been the sole actor in this work ) was enough to salvage a botched attempt . He stole the show with a near brilliant performance . The story was a bit over that line of believability , but it was well written and executed well , so I won't fault it for that . There was this small ( but fitting ) quality of suspense where Ledger and his " foxy lady " were concerned , and it added a nice atmosphere to this love story which blended very well with the " Run " scene , later . All in all , it was very enjoyable . Some were disappointed , as they expected an action flick , rather than a love story with action elements . But it wasn't good . Not until the " show us a dance from Gelderland " scene . When David Bowie starts playing , it sealed the moment and framed it forever in my mind . I was thoroughly sold on this device . Now , true enough , it will fail with other scripts . The work has to be written for the music ; centered around the music , without allowing the music itself to interrupt the atmosphere and / or pace of the film . All this , they accomplished . The finished product was a great deal more than the mere sum of its parts , and shows itself to be an enjoyable and entertaining endeavor which played out to a satisfying end .

558604	2626332	82495	8.0	Just as scary , dramatic and entertaining as the original !	This marvelous sequel picks up right where the first one left off , and delivers an end product that is just as scary , dramatic and entertaining as the original ! This sequel is just as good to " Halloween " as " The Godfather , Part 2 " was to " The Godfather . " Debra Hill and John Carpenter have produced another fine production in this sequel which strives hard to justice to the original . . . and succeeds with flying colors . On watching these movies again for this review , I have really come to appreciate just how well this movie follows the original . The acting is quite enjoyable , the scenes are well thought-out out and executed and the plot is firmly in place and congruent with the first movie . These movies , the Halloween " series , " were meant to be more than just your run of the mill slasher flix , and these first two were just that . After this one , they go off the storyline and venture off into the Land of Stupid . . . all the way to Halloween H20 . That's where you get a free pass from Insipid-land for a beautiful sequel made 20 years after the original . Great movie ! And then we slip back into the World of Idiotic Movies with Halloween-Resurrection . And I understand that they are in production with Halloween 9 Why ? ! In my opinion , just get H 1 , 2 and H20 and run them back to back . You honestly never EVER miss the other movies which had nothing whatSOever to do with the original movie or its storyline . H2 and H20 bring it back into line and perpetuate the horror that is Michael Myers . Excellent sequel to an excellent movie . Wonderfully scary slasher with a good plot . This is also the movie where you discover why Laurie Strode is being pursued by psycho / stalker / slasher Michael A . Myers . You get a few good , but uncomfortable , laughs as well . Laughing at our fears is healthy for us . I'm not in ANY way saying this movie is campy because it's far from it . It is definitely one of the few truly GOOD horror movies out there . But like the scene where the watchman at the hospital investigates the phone outages , looks into the dumpster and gets the living begeezes scared out of him makes you jump and then laugh due to the source of his fright . If you like these movies , you may like the " Scream " trilogy , though I do hesitate to put them in the same category with " Halloween .

559120	2626332	298148	8.0	Less Cynical , More Endearing .	The second installment of the Shrek franchise was less cynical , but more in your face than the first . The snide comments are still present , but they are presented this time in a family atmosphere , for the most part , and therefore were less sexual in nature . Mostly . The characters this time are more extravagant , less adventuresome , but at the same time , they cast a creative spin on older , more familiar storybook characters and reintroduced them into the Shrekiverse . I thought that was a smart move , considering the content and execution of this particular story line . I ultimately found this endeavor more enjoyable than the first .

( Kathleen Turner ) this was a beautiful and rare collaboration between Disney and Warner Brothers ; something I wish they would repeat . This film is hard to describe to those who have yet to see it . I hope I do it justice . First off , this is not mere animation . It is a combination of animation and live acting , which works wonderfully together here to weave a gritty , touching story . Also , this is not for younger audiences . There is quite a bit of harsh language , sexual referencing , and adult innuendo , not to mention some gruesome murders . While there is a total lack of gore , the implications are still there . There are murders , mysteries , twists , and some really strong performances . It is a really gritty story , yet sweet and endearing at the same time .

558634	2626332	122933	8.0	Sweet and Smart	This film is delightful . It's also sad and disrespectful , while maintaining a nice level of dark comedy . The dynamic between Crystal and DeNiro is the machinery that makes this work . Crystal is the quasi-neurotic psychiatrist while DeNiro portrays the panic-ridden , anxiety-prone psychotic with severe abandonment issues , and a strong need to maintain the Alpha Dog posture . Thus you have the grist for the mill . Joe Viterelli delivers a fantastic performance as Jelly , DeNiro's right hand man , but even Joe's marvelous performance is upstaged by an emotional DeNiro and the shrink who is trying to help keep him alive . The surreal feeling throws off those male viewers who cannot see the humor in an alpha dog losing his nerve ; those viewers will undoubtedly dog DeNiro's choice to take on this role , saying he's gone soft , etc . It took great courage and security in his own masculinity to take on a part like this , and I applaud it , and him for having the nerve to do it . I found myself laughing from start to finish . This is a fine comedy , and I have shared it with many friends . It rates an from . . . the Fiend : .
559544	2626332	120891	8.0	If This Hadn't Been Associated Wtih The Television Series , It Would Have Done Well !	Honestly , what most people didn't like about this film is that they cast Will Smith in a part previously carried by a white guy , a popular actor , and the lead of another popular television show , Ba Ba Black Sheep . It insensed many people , and others felt outright insulted . If they had named this ANYthing else , it would have been MUCH more successful . But alas ! No one listens to me . LOL It made its money back , barely , but has a horrible rating here at IMDb . I personally think it deserves better than the 4 . whatever rating it holds today , but there is further cause for this phenomenon . The South was depicted as insanely ignorant , and the north was given victory only by virtue of Southern capability gone awry . Neither the North NOR the South liked THAT one , I can guarantee it . Me ? I don't take sides . The Civil War stops here , with my family line . I had kin who fought on both sides , so I don't share the same prejudices , even though I'm from the South .

Okay , I have to start by saying I really do enjoy 50 First Dates better , in spite of Rob Schneider , but The Wedding Singer is a very good Romantic Comedy . In fact , this is one of the best since the Meg Ryan RomCom run ended . I'm not typically one for romantic comedies , or at least I wasn't , but I still found this exceptional , especially for an Adam Sandler movie . But having said that , I must interject that Drew Barrymore is a dream . She brings joy to almost anything she's in .

559097	2626332	158811	8.0	Muppet Evolution	The Muppets we loved so much , have changed . Is it for the better , or the worse ? You decide . While this movie was more like the sequel to the original " The Muppet Movie , " in that it tries to explain Gonzo's origins , as the first did Kermit's , there is a definitive difference between Brian Henson's Muppets and those of his father : it's not as zany . The plot is wonderfully written , and acted well by the human actors and lovingly portrayed by the muppeteers . However , the Muppets have lost their edge ; the crisp delivery of the zany but witty one-liners is gone . Forever ? Gods , I hope not . I hope Brian is just warming up to those incredible shoes he has to fill , and isn't planning on changing the magic his father created all those years ago with a simple sock puppet and the creativity of a genius . The soundtrack , while not usual Muppet fare , is excellent ' 70's giants like Hot Chocolate , James Brown , etc . Wonderful music . I loved that change ! Don't worry , the Muppets sing along and dance , as usual and the adult innuendo is properly guarded and camouflaged , in classic Jim Henson style . - MAJOR SPOILER ! ! - I had one problem with this movie . Even after you go through the whole ordeal with Gonzo , you never know WTF he is ! They don't tell you ! Okay , he's not from this planet , but what IS he ? WHY leave that out ?

559145	2626332	120903	8.0	Dazzling depth for a comic book movie	I love this series of comic books , and I was not disappointed with the movie , although the character development I had hoped would be rich , was almost nonexistent , and there wasn't enough movie here to satisfy . It is 104 minutes long and needed to be at least two hours to enable some decent character development . While they tried , they fell short of what I would deem acceptable in this area . Other than that , this movie was very well done . The action sequences were rousing , the portrayals given were a good start in the right direction . The direction itself proved to be inspired , and the sets were creative . This whole production was executed in a manner which lent the darkling feel of mystery captured in the comic book , and some awe-inspiring CG-Eye Candy sequences made this film appear to be more than it should have been . The casting is one element which gave this movie its incredible success , but the effects and story were the products of a great and loving care devoted to the production of this movie , and it shows with each and every scene . This is a classic good vs . evil story with some romance , loads of action , a great story , and wonderful creative characters . It is pure sci-fi / action fan-boy delight . Let me also say that I highly recommend the X-Men 1 . 5 Edition . With over 5 hours of features , interviews and exclusive new extras , it is a bargain at the asking price !

558947	2626332	120915	8.0	Watch it for what it is , rather than what others expect it to be . . .	It seems to be " trendy " to have bad things to say about this work , but I found it largely captivating . As the first ( or rather , the fourth , but we won't go into that ) installment of the Star Wars saga , this was meant not as a climactic piece of cinematic art , but more as an introduction to the series . This chapter of the Star Wars space opera had no " real " climactic center , no true " ending . " This is why the studios chose chapter 4 , the central climactic center of the story , to finance first . Of course , Lucas financed the rest , and 20th Century / Fox lost all rights to their share of the Lucas / Star Wars money machine when they lost their studio head , years ago . It was only due to Lucas's " generosity " that they still retain distribution rights . This work was an opening chapter only and had it been the first to have been made , the audiences would have been left to say , " WTF ? ! was that ? " So chapter 4 was rewritten to contain a definite beginning , climactic center , and ending so that it more resembled a " stand alone " feature . You know . . . just in case . But Lucas knew what he was doing , and Star Wars 1 ( as it was known then ) quickly became Star Wars : Episode 4 - A New Hope , and the progenitor of the Star Wars run . The action most critics seem to have missed , is covert . Duplicitious characters surreptitiously bargain behind closed doors , thereby setting up the story and the beautifully rich darkling sub-plots . And there IS actual action enough to keep even the die-hards entertained . But suspense , rather than action , is the element which fuels this fire . Action comes from the climactic build up , and is prevalent in Episodes 4-6 because they were the climax of the series . So don't be too disappointed if there is more story to these prequel installments , than action . The story is designed to bring about the action in the later episodes . Another issue with this work is the CGI . Fans are so accustomed to hearing the purists complain about the CGI from the Original Trilogy , that they've forgotten why there's an issue . That having been said , the CGI in this installment ultimately makes the final product as adventurous , exciting , and cohesive in story as it was . Lucas's Star Wars Universe is beautifully conceived , and wondrously executed as to be a treasure which is the fourth highest grossing film ever . Apparently , someone liked it . His characters are beautifully conceived and executed , and competently paint the world of Lucas in such a way as to endear , not repulse . All characters but one : Jar Jar Binks . He is more annoying than the Ewoks , and not half as amusing . He seems to be lacking cultural identity , but if you listen closely , his language and pronunciation closely resembles Mush Mouth from the Fat Albert show . He also , at times , sounds Jamaican . But it's on again , off again . I think this installment could have done well without him . Yes , he serves a purpose ; that of comic relief . You can't help but laugh at his ineptitude , regardless of how you feel about his presence . Yes , he is key to the plot elements , but Lucas could have created a much better , more PC little guy than this Ebonics-speaking , long-eared , spotty-lipped , blunderbuss . Much has been said concerning " stiff " performances . I can't help but laugh at that . Liam Neeson was characterized as a high-level Jedi , and he portrayed his part , as such , with dignity and sense of propriety . He was perfect as Qui-Gon Jinn and his bearing commanded respect . That was not stiff acting . That was an extraordinarily competent show of character acting . If that means he comes off as " stiff , " so be it . We get to see the beginnings of C3PO and R2D2 at the very beginning of his involvement with the progenitors of the Rebellion . Anakin Skywalker is young ( very young ) , and as good a child actor as you could ask . He is impressively portrayed by Jake Lloyd . I cannot wait to see where his life takes him . He is an incredible actor already . Natalie Portman was a complete surprise as Queen Amadala . She , too , has been described as " stiff " by many critics . But I must interject that , as Queen , she presents a stately presence . If that's considered " stiff , " fine . But I saw it as an incredibly accurate and apt characterization . Royalty can BE a bit " stiff " at times . Ewan McGregor is perfectly cast as Obi-Wan Kenobi , as he represents the " go get'em " attitude Sir Alec Guiness shows in his undertaking as Obi-Wan in Episodes 4 and 5 . It is this Fiend's opinion that he was the epitome of a young Obi-Wan , and effectuated his role with a quality of poise for which I hadn't dared hope . This is an excellent introduction to the Star Wars Universe . It rates an in appreciation for what it was , rather than what other critics expected it to be , from . . . the Fiend : .
559421	2626332	103776	8.0	Disappointing but not dismal Burton sequel	The campy , carnival-like atmosphere above ground , while utter insanity in the guise of the Penguin stalks the city , beneath . Sounds intriguing to watch , doesn't it ? But Gotham City just isn't what it used to be . Gone , are the beautifully designed Gothic structures , replaced by gadgetry and standard , disappointing Hollywood fluff . There is plenty of eye candy , but that does not distract you from the fact that so much else is lacking . Has Burton lost his edge ? I wouldn't think so . But in this attempt , he resorts to obvious fifth-grader tactics to amuse us ; ie : the Penguin drooling black filth from his mouth throughout most of his scenes ( what WAS that crap , anyway ? ) , and killer clowns ( which were oh so reminiscent of the detrital film , " Killer Klowns from Outer Space " and the 60's camp of Adam West ) . While this production was still quite entertaining , it held none of the wondrous edge from the original masterpiece . I did , however , love the performances of the principal actors ; Michael Keaton as Batman ( Bruce Wayne ) , Danny DeVito as The Penguin / Oswald Cobblepot , Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman / Selina Kyle , Christopher Walken as Max Shreck , and that wonderful Michael Gough as Alfred Pennyworth . Their portrayals were quite professional ; the character depth was well developed and everyone contributed what I feel was their very best . What lacked here , in my opinion , was that lovely darkling nightmarish feel from the first . The Dark Knight having been turned into the Light Grey Knight , Gotham ( Gothic ) City was dismayingly morphed into a Carnival Midway , and the allowance of the horrid 60's camp at which we all groaned and rolled our eyes to creep into this otherwise darkly amusing production was just purely wrong . Sorry , but I fail to find having my gag reflex triggered to be entertaining . Honestly , I was still amused by this flick . DiVito's talent for acting is above reproach , though I found his constant black drool to be completely repulsive and it turned me off of his character totally . Again , that falls into the area of directing , and in no way cheapens his performance . Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman was mildly reminiscent of Eartha Kitt's portrayal and thus endeared the character . While she delivered her own style and talents to the characters of Seline and Catwoman , she portrayed Catwoman beautifully as a witty , intelligent seductress . Hers was a wonderful performance and I loved the perpetuation of the romance between Batman and Catwoman . " It's the so-called normal guys who always let you down . Sickos never scare me . At least they're committed . " Seline to Bruce Wayne . The attempt to humanize Bruce Wayne was a serious mistake . Gone is the edgy , almost sinister feel to the Gothic hero , the " Dark Knight . " Enter , instead , the comedic equivalent ; this reincarnation of a masterpiece . It didn't work for me on any level . Bruce Wayne , cracking jokes , forgetting his coat over some piece of fluff girl , and snapping off one-liners to the bad guys as he pretends to kick their butts . What a disappointment after the last Burton attempt . I found the change to be sad , rather than fresh or edgy . There were several points of this production that I found to be quite unoriginal . Penguin's plan to kidnap / kill the first born sons of Gotham was rather Biblesque and lame . The James Bondesque music during Shreck's party was rather tasteless . As I mentioned before , the whole movie had a " Killer Klowns from Outer Space " feel to it beneath the failed attempt to be Gothic and dark as the original from which this spawned . The voice designated to Penguin's computer alert system at the climax of the movie was very V'ger-like ( Star Trek : the Motion Picture ) , bordering on identical . And I've got one question . If the Penguin's army is penguins , and he himself identifies with penguins . . . WHY is he driving around in something as infantile as a rubber duck ? Just another contrived and trashy element I found disturbing and unattractive . " How outstanding ! You're Beauty AND the Beast , in one luscious Christmas gift-pack . " Penguin . While this production fell short of the first , it was still a fun and enjoyable movie , if only for the performances of the main players . I am frankly glad that Burton will not be directing the next installment of this , the " modern " Batman series . I am looking forward to Jim Carey and Tommy Lee Jones's performances . But Val Kilmer in the leading role ? We'll just have to wait and see . This one rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
559402	2626332	52722	9.0	Enchanting , But Dated , and A Bit Scary For The Tots	A wonderfully enchanting live-action Disney fantasy with ( oddly enough ) some strong horror elements . This is a lovely fantasy featuring , among other well-known at the time thespians , Janet Murro and Sean Connery . The cast is peopled almost entirely of Irish-born talent , lending a certain sense of reality to this charming faerie-tale which would otherwise have been absent . The sets and scenery are really quite lovely , as is the story itself , the music , the atmosphere , the cast , and the finished product . This movie was fine example of premium vintage Disney live entertainment . The cinematography was strong , with lovely shots of the tor and the countryside . The sound effects were realistic as were the visual effects ; haunting and darkly beautiful . The horror elements mentioned include , among other things , the family banshee ( all of the " best " of Irish clans had their own , you see ) , the Celtic Grim Reaper , a Pookha ( click My name above and read My review of " Harvey " starring Jimmy Stewart for more on Pookhas ) , a village witch ( not a nice one ) , and of course , the Leprechauns . This is one of the best of the old classics , and while it is enchanting just as it is , I would love to see it receive a good modernized CGI treatment . I mean why not ? They're emptying out the vaults and remaking everything else . This one is far more deserving than most . This movie was great fun , and is an excellent addition to any Disney collection of an older child ( There is more than a lot of alcohol use and a nice bar-room brawl featuring Sean Connery's character , which may be a bit too intense and / or disturbing for younger children ) . This was a fantastic movie which is now dated and warrants a modern remake . It also belongs in any fantasy collection or horror collection .

This movie presents excellent direction , a cleverly-written screenplay and possibly some of the best acting of Sigourney Weaver's career . This is another movie I've watched over and over for the sheer entertainment quality . I highly enjoy its marvelous character development and the tense feeling this whole production generates . Sigourney Weaver portrays a criminologist who specializes in serial homicide . After years of lecture tours on the subject and the serial killers themselves , she is attacked and traumatized so badly that agoraphobia takes a firm grip on her psyche . As time goes on , the intensity of her condition increases to its worst degree . Now , more than a year later , she comes face to face with her worst nightmare : a new incarnation of Daryll Lee ' Killer ' Cullum . Ripped away from everyone she can trust , everyone she has allowed even nominally close to her , she is totally alone and at the mercy of her greatest fear . As her tormentor's plot develops , you will find yourself literally on the edge of your seat . Killer Cullum is portrayed in a startling manner by Harry Connick , Jr . His follower ' Peter Curtain Foley ' is convincingly portrayed by William McNamara . While the cinematography of this production was little more than average , the settings and scenery were creatively executed . You never get the feeling that they shot this movie in five rooms that they kept redecorating , as you do in many films of this type . The direction was very well done , and Sigourney Weaver is absolutely convincing as the ' pill-popping , juice-head , hyperventilating , agoraphobic @ sshøle . ' ( Inspector M . J . Monahan , played by Holly Hunter ) This is a great movie , and one of my favorites . It rates an from . . . the Fiend : .
559584	2626332	91225	9.0	Wonderfully funny and sweet comic book fare .	This film was recently ( as of 10-2003 ) featured in MSN's 10 Worst Movies of all Time , and bears a paltry ( or . . . poultry ) here at IMDb . And , with a 30M budget and a $16 , 295 , 774 ( USA ) gross return , I have to admit , it did bomb . That not withstanding , I LOVE this movie . It's campy , funny ( if not witty ) , heart-warming , and has some good elements . The sound track itself is excellent , the story is cute and easy to follow , the performances are solid tongue-in-cheek deliveries , and the movie as a whole still bears that George Lucas style . I watch this movie about once a month , and enjoy it each and every time . The effects are realistic , the monsters are not badly done , and the characters are developed well enough to allow them to be likable and to enable us to care about what happens . And yes , while I found the bestiality scene to be quite distasteful , it was still sweet , and fuzzy-feeling provoking , regardless of the moral / ethical implications . It's a fun fantasy , with some good elements , decent action , and strong comic-book overtones to match the original from which this was adapted . Sorry , Lucas . It deserved better than it got . I rate it from . . . The Fiend : .
558945	2626332	75807	9.0	One of the BEST Disney Live Action Family Movies Of Its Time	Before this vehicle became contrived , Disney did it while it was still fresh . A group of orphans must save the castle in which their adoptive " grandmother " has housed them . This work involves some intrigue and a very young Jodi Foster as a nearly incorrigible ruffian girl . This is a lot of fun , but it also bears some touching moments , endearing characters , and a great script . Honestly , this is one of my favorites of the Disney Family series . It offers you hope , love , and a promise of better things to come . This is truly good . It rates an from . . . the Fiend : .

Had I remembered this , I would not have been concerned over Jackson's King Kong ( 2005 ) . Enemy of the State delivers intrigue , suspense , action , intelligence , and actually generates some tense atmosphere . The dialog is never trite , the story line is well developed , not contrived . The performances are top notch . And the action is superb . This is one good movie . It rates an from . . . the Fiend : .
559493	2626332	380599	9.0	Keeping Up With the Dickens	Over the years , Oliver Twist has been made and remade many times over . There are countless tales intended as adaptations , re-imaginings , and direct translations of the original Charles Dickens work . Everyone from Broadway to the Disney has a version with their stamp on it , including Disney's " Oliver " about a set of dogs under the same circumstances as the original Dickens characters . The performances herein are darkly beautiful , retaining the dark beauty of the original work . Actually , cinematically speaking , this is probably the best straight remake of the original classic I've ever seen . I found this version to be the best , so far due to filming styles , and maintaining a competent update without losing the atmosphere of the original . This production bears the perfect feeling of despair , drudgery , and betrayal as the original work , and as such , rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
558639	2626332	348150	9.0	Highly Enjoyable , In Spite of Its Flaws	Complete with a " Marlow and Me " hound , our hero is thoroughly American in spite of the claim that he belongs to the world . Frank Langella's Perry White asks , " Does he still stand for truth . . . justice ? " without completing the question by adding , " . . . the American Way . " I found it offensive that this was left as it is . Superman is an American hero . Where is " the American Way ? " I was NOT amused . Also , there is NO American Flag anywhere in this movie . What is UP with this ? Again , I was NOT amused . However . . . Kevin Spacey is probably the best Lex Luthor ever ! As the Ralph Finnes of this series , his presence is subsequently dark and fiendishly clever . Spacey is awesome as the arch-nemesis of Superman . Simply awesome . This movie features several original tracks from Superman with Christopher Reeve , of Marlon Brando's voice and image . That is the most fitting homage which could have been paid . Nice touch , Singer . What did disappoint slightly is seeing Brian Singer's name approximately 8 times in the opening credits . Singer is a faithless lover . He has " done it again " with Superman Returns , but can we trust him to remain true this time ? Will he ditch this franchise for the next one like he did X-Men , when the mood ( and the paycheck ) strikes him ? He is listed as being in negotiations to write and direct the next installment , but he was also listed with X-Men 3 before he bailed , so the jury's still out on that one . Thankfully , this is a sequel and NOT a remake , as was first announced . I am personally very happy that this work uplifts Reeve's prior work , rather than negates it . Also present were dedications to Reeve and his now deceased wife . Without it , we fans of the Reeve movies would have risen up in rebellion . Also , there is a nice cameo mention of Gotham City ! Again , nice touches . Well , that is not entirely accurate . It IS a remake , but it is a remake of Superman 3 . The studios decided to ignore the 3rd ( boo ! ! ! ) and 4th ( good move ! ) installments of Superman's 70's-80's run , and begin again , but not all the way back to the beginning . I have mixed feelings about this , as I LOVE the 3rd installment with Rich , but they didn't take that away from the Ultimate Superman Collection , so I won't fuss too much . When watching Superman 2 , the Donner Cut and then Superman Returns , this movie flows seamlessly . Parker Posey . I can only say I did not hate her performance this time around . This is the first time , by the way , that her voice did not create the " fingernails on the chalkboard " phenomena for me . I have to admit that this was also the first time I drew some enjoyment from a Parker Posey character . I hope this portends her future performances . Kate Bosworth is a huge disappointment for this reviewer . Of course , I never expected much , as her work has never appealed to me , but here , she is simply lifeless . She dialed in her weak performance which was so barely adequate , that it left Routh and Huntington to take up her slack . Sam Huntington , on the other hand , is a convincing Jimmy Olsen . His bright , fresh face and " golly , gee-whiz " persona is fresh and pure , and straight from the 1950's . He is most excellent as Olsen . Which leads us to Brandon Routh . I had doubts . He is not Christopher Reeve , and frankly , I was not interested in a Superman movie without Christopher Reeve . I am happy to report that I was misgiven in my disdain of such a proposition . It is downright eerie how much Routh resembles Christopher Reeve . It is just spooky . He is every bit as good as Superman , as Bale is as Batman . No doubts . There are nice twists , clever story , and awesome effects , which are nearly overridden by a complete lack of color and life . Even Superman's newly redesigned costume is almost totally lacking in color . Other than that , the costume rethinking is extremely clever , with only tasteful changes , which do not alter his appearance or our perceptions of him beyond a glaring lack of an American Flag anywhere in sight . Fortunately , there were no extreme costume changes to put off the average movie-goer ; much unlike Schumacher's addition of nipples to the Bat-Suit . Oy Vey . As previously mentioned , the principal photography and color scheme is too dark for my tastes . Not in mood or atmosphere , but in contrast , depth , and color . It takes something of the " life " which would have otherwise been adherent to this work , away . Because of this over-thinking ( or just bad choices on Singer's part ) , I found the visuals to be unremarkable . It is clearly a shame , as the work itself is beautifully executed . The color choices were obvious , glaring , and detracting . I do have to state that this work is much too violent for younger children , unless you do not consider a realistic and graphic portrayal of the bad guys beating the living daylights out of Superman and ultimately stabbing him to death with a Kryptonite shard , too violent . In that event , do not bother with listening to my admonitions . Otherwise , I would view the movie before allowing small children to . My favorite part ? The cannibalistic canine scene . " Weren't there two of those ? " What a HOOT ! In summation , this work features great action , clever story with nice twists , and stellar performances ( for the most part ) . It just needed some freaking color and a better , more enthusiastic score . It was highly enjoyable , in spite of its flaws . It rates an from . . . the Fiend : .
559160	2626332	360717	9.0	Good Movie , Horrid Editing . I Expected Better Out Of Jackson .	The characterization of 1930's depression-era New York was hauntingly beautiful , authentic , and inspired . The recreation of the shanty town on the city outskirts was beautifully morose . 1930's NYC's careful reconstruction included the Pepsodent commercial billboards and the famous AlHambre Theater ( in which Kong is later displayed ) . Naomi Watts was brilliant as Ann Darrow , an excellent casting choice who turned in a stunning performance , which added new dimensions to the character . It is obvious that Jack Black was miscast in this role , but he certainly rose to the occasion ! He was a wonderful Carl Denham . In character or out , Black is convincing as a bllsht artist . Adrian Brody is NOT a romantic lead ! He is a capable actor who contributed a compelling performance , but his nose was in Naomi's EAR ! when they kissed ! They had to film him at a - profile to get a straight shot on his nose ! Miles of superfluous footage was shot and left IN the film ; art-house dreck which did not belong , resulting in a major loss of atmosphere . The arrival upon Skull Island was quite dramatic ; the structures were immense and spectacularly filmed , and the huge legendary wall was reminiscent of Helm's Deep . Their landing and approach to the deserted city began with a nice voice-over by Evan Parke ( Hayes ) , and it lent a nice eerie feeling to the work-up of the Island sequence . This was backed up by loads of wonderful set design and prop details which did more than just " back up " the intro , they helped create the whole atmosphere he tried to generate on the boat-trip to the island in the first place , IF you can force yourself to let go of the hour and fifteen minutes ' set up time . It does seem that Jackson's contractual screen-time obligations are what made the audience sit through a dragging hour-long introduction to the island . The CGI native pole-vaulting from rock to rock to the U . S . S . Venture looked like a lesser video-game character . I've seen Video Games which were better illustrated . Kong's entrance was extremely unremarkable . The wonderful lead into the scene offered little in the way of immediate pay off ; however . . . Kong himself is now a giant silver-back . He is magnificent and it is obvious Jackson developed him with the same love and care as he did the LotR saga . THIS is an awesome Kong ! Unfortunately , the dino pile-up scene demonstrated staggering CGI . CGI so ill-used and poorly edited that it was sloppy ! The scene was quite intense , but the CGI was just plain nasty . You could make out the blue screen lines around some of the characters where they were placed in front of the dinos . BAD ! The shrunken heads found everywhere really reminded me of Gollum . The skulls were shrunken , but every one had huge eye sockets which immediately reminded me of baby Gollums . I wonder if that was Jackson's attempt at a self-homage . . . ? ? If so , it failed . The dinosaurs were excellent . Jackson didn't rely on previous interpretations of these predators , he designed his own . All of Jacksons dinosaurs were top row . Their design was different from what we've come to expect from the movies we've previously enjoyed , and that did change the feel of the film . . . in a positive way . His premise that the dinos would look different , having evolved in an utterly isolated habitat , far from any other dinosaur-populated area ; that was the basis for his restructuring the head ridges and hides . The raptors got a whole new design altogether , and the T-Rexes were darkly sinister . I also loved the saber-toothed were-bats . They were excellent ! However , the giant bug scene was a bit much . It was totally unnecessary and lent nothing to the story . Naomi's neck and spine should have snapped in two at least 30 times , while Kong was whipping her around . There is no WAY anyone would have survived that ! Unfortunately , the first time Kong scoops her up , she would have been a paraplegic ( at best , but probably a quadriplegic ) ! Also , the CGI in that scene was horrid . You could tell that was most certainly NOT a human being in Kong's hand . Thankfully , the natives were not depicted as retro south side Chicagoites with huge afros and Geri curls this time . Instead Jackson went for cannibals sporting exotic body modifications and extreme facial piercings ! One stereotypical cliché after another . The " beautiful " scene on the Island bears a bad spot on the film located at the top right quarter of the screen . I couldn't believe the sloppy editing ! I mean . . . for $207M , WETA could have afforded a decent editor ! Please don't misunderstand . Although there are CGI disappointments , this is one of the most visually stunning films I've ever seen ! The cinematography is beautiful and inspired , and the Kong graveyard was a very nice , sentimental touch which gave you some insight into the haunting sadness visible in Kong's eyes . In spite of the high level of entertainment , the ending was flaccid . No matter what the other problems are , or what they do to the DVD " fix " later , the ending is still gonna be weak , IMO . When Jackson's Kong dies at the end , Watts just watches him slip off the Empire State Building ! ! It was like . . . " Well , he's dead . How sad . Let's go . " It was far too subdued for my tastes . I enjoyed it , but it was NOT the $207M masterpiece it should have been . It rates a ( HP4 Scored Higher ) from . . . a somewhat disappointed Fiend : . EDIT : I have to say that the Director's Cut DVD has fixed the problems , and the addition of just 2 seconds of exposition at the ending has cleared away that problem , too . The Director's Cut Edition rates an from . . . the Fiend : .
558797	2626332	87469	9.0	Amazing , fun , darker second adventure	After seeing the original Indiana Jones movie , Raiders of the Lost Ark , I did not think it was possible to do any better than that , but this " sequel " is every bit as good as the original work . With the addition of " Short Round , " a small boy new to the company of Indiana Jones , the producers have given children a new connection with this franchise . It turned out to be a brilliant move , and a wonderful addition which , unfortunately , they did not carry through to the third installment . What struck me most with this work was the depth of research done concerning the Sankara Stones . According to legend , there were five of these stones , taken from what is now referred to as the Sankara Complex , in India . The legend has it just as it is represented in the movie . In the presence of three or more of the stones , you were given an increasingly higher level of power by the Deities . To possess all five , you would be invincible . The Thugee Murder Cult was , and is , real . They have been documented and even associated with the Zodiac killings of the 60-70's , and mentioned , however briefly , in the disappearance of Jon Benet Ramsey . These followers of the dark Goddess of Death , Kali , of the Hindu Pantheon of deities , were known for living dual lives , especially when in other countries where secrecy was an issue . They believe that by sending souls to Kali , their lives here will be uplifted by this dark Goddess , and therefore , they have been known to commit multiple murders , including the annihilation of entire villages throughout India . These practitioners of the Black Kabballah are very real , and were depicted quite well in this production . I was very impressed with the degree of research involved here . This is action from the beginning ; adventure through and through . A grand total of ONE slow spot was found here , and that was used to further the character development of Short Round , and show the depth of his relationship with Dr . Jones . I thoroughly enjoyed this movie . The costumes were wonderfully designed , and were quite authentic in the area of Indian style and dress . I pay attention to set designs and costuming . They can make or break a movie , for me . Rich architectural designs can add so much to a movie , just as unrealistic , plastic-looking " rock " surfaces in the background , can kill the whole mood of the scene . But you have none of those problems with these productions . It appears as though no expense was spared ; no scene overlooked . This is a true quality production . Furthermore , the performances were completely believable , even those of the Indian children who were originally cast as extras . Their performances were absolutely wonderful , the story was quite enthralling , and the time just sped by . The only problem I had with this movie is that it was over far too quickly . This attempt was professional in all ways , and is , in my opinion , the very best of this series . This is my favorite of the Indiana Jones run for its dark realism . It rates an from . . . the Fiend : .
558782	2626332	100802	9.0	Action-filled sci-fi thinker	In my honest opinion , this is the most intellectual of Arnold Schwarzenegger's movies . The screenplay and plot lines are so well written , coherent , imaginative and complex and cohesive . The performances of these stellar actors are absolutely professional , quality and believably portrayed . PLOTWhile his wife teasingly steers him clear of his obsession , Doug Quaid is obsessed with Mars and Earth's colonization of the Red Planet . In an attempt to realize his obsession without damaging his marriage , he goes to the much-touted " Recall , " a memory implants vacation team to have at least the memory of having been to Mars . But something goes wrong , and before they can implant the " secret agent " portion of his mental " vacation , " they hit a memory cap which was already installed by an anonymous governmental bureau known only as " the agency . " He freaks and begins screaming at the techies , " YOU BLEW MY COVER ! ! " END PLOTFrom that point on , the action does not stop . But this is not your typical Schwarzenegger fare . This action is underlined and surrounded by intelligence , thoughtfulness and a main plot riddled with complicated sub-plots which are cleverly written and beautifully executed . The sets are creatively designed , the scenes are wonderfully constructed , and the landscapes of Mars are pure sci-fi / effects genius . The visual effects are some of the best I've ever seen ANYwhere , and the finished product leaves you feeling more enlightened and thoroughly entertained . For these reasons I say , this is one of the best of AS's movies . It tops T1 & T2 . These three , are his absolute best in the genre of sci-fi / action . A definite " Must See , " even if you are a fan of sci-fi alone and do not really care about the Schwarzenegger element . As a PS , I would like to add that the Special Edition DVD version of this movie is much more enjoyable with advanced digital sound , remastered Widescreen visuals and a commentary with AS and the director Paul Verhoeven . There is also a behind the scenes special that shows you why this movie won the Academy Awards for special achievement in visual effects . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
558618	2626332	362841	9.0	Better than the movie	The third installment is the weakest link of the Jurassic chain . This documentary goes a long way toward explaining what happened with this installment , but did nothing in the way of changing my opinion of the movie . It explains everything from concept to post production , but fails to inspire even the smallest vein of dedication to this chapter . Let's compare . This documentary receives a 6 . 4 from regular users here at IMDb , while the movie it documents earns a 5 . 6 . ( blank stare ) However , I shall attempt to not throw the downfalls of Jurassic Park 3 onto this " making of " documentary . It explains that the " spinosaurus " was ( in its largest specimen ) 57 feet tall and the largest carnivorous dinosaur ever found , while the T-Rex was 45 feet tall . It does show that the movie was done with as many models and latex effects as it was CG . Full sized animatronics , and amazing attention to detail . I hate that it did not pay off on film , and do sincerely hope it does not impact on the upcoming JP4 . I give it a Documentary Scale from . . . the Fiend : .
559241	2626332	427954	9.0	AKA : The Protectors . . . Forget the Complainers ! Tony Jaa is Like A God !	This is a " B " quality production , but this Tony Jaa is far superior to the vehicle which displays his talents . Tony bears a strong resemblance to Jai of Ron Ely / Tarzan fame ( Manuel Padilla Jr . ) , and is noted at least once as being " pretty . " He definitely carries a fantastic on-screen presence , although he doesn't seem to have a singular style , but rather demonstrates proficiency in a myriad of techniques and martial arts styles . Muay Thai seems to be his base , but I believe it is more Bokutor , mixed with Prodalserey ( a more modern form of the ancient Muay Boran or Bokutor ) . From that ancient and diverse base , he draws from Jeet-kun-do , Ninjitsu , Jujitsu , Judo , and a plethora of other styles , including full on Akido at the end ! This kid looks like Jackie Chan one minute , Bruce Lee the next , and then Stephen Seagal back when he was young and still rock and rolled ! You see a strong Jet Li-esquire style , with Chow Yun Fat undertones , with the mastery of fury of Bolo Yeung . He demonstrates some amazing skill ! It's like he ( Jaa ) has studied every possible style and has mastered each one ! Aside from giving the viewer a total appreciation for this " new " talent ( Jaa ) , this film an emotionally strong , well-developed story involving the Protectors who train and then protect the Imperial Elephants of Thai Royalty . All in all ? If you are a fan of the martial arts venue , I would highly recommend this film , though it is a " B " flick , with a " C " budget and film quality . Tony Jaa is a name to remember ! We were highly entertained , and look forward to great things from this young Master . It rates a on the " B " Scale .

Among the many wonderful comedies starring Bill Murray , this one has to be one of my favorites . It's a rather irreverent remaking of the Dickinsian classic , " A Christmas Carol , " and is one of the best of Bill Murray's portrayals , in my opinion . This quirky , funny , and sometimes melancholy movie is quite entertaining , intelligently funny , and a must see for any fan of the original work which this movie parodies . Murray is a classic megalomaniac ; a sycophantic , narcissistic , egocentric fool who manages , through his bastardization of the human condition , to rate the " ghost of xmas past , present , and future " treatment from the Powers That Be .

559296	2626332	111280	9.0	Calculated treachery	Generations . For me , this is a sad movie . The movie itself was excellently done , and just as good as all the others , but the content just . . . saddens me . With Sulu's daughter at the helm of the Enterprise-B , the crew of " living legends " accompanies a skeleton crew of trainees on a press blow out of a short jaunt , which turns into a distress call / rescue mission which morphs into something very serious . Meet the Nexus ; a ribbon of the time / space continuum which has the ability to create and destroy anything in its path ; to take it / them to different " whens " and " wheres . " This is the unfortunate end of Kirk's reign as Captain of the Enterprise . He disappears into the Nexus and into an eternity of peace on his old Iowa farm . Or so it seems . I wanted him to die in battle . Be assassinated in his sleep . Anything noble . But instead , he was given a peaceful eternity . OK , fine . I have no choice but to deal with it . While I respect Piccard as Captain of the Enterprise , he will never be James Tiberius Kirk . But this is the end of the old series and the beginning of the new ; hence the name " Generations . " If you are a fan of these movies , a collector of anything Star Trek , this is a definite needful addition to the set . This is the movie which ties the two series together . Meet Captain Piccard and crew . I'll assume you're already familiar with them and I won't bore you with the details . Over the years , I have developed ( if somewhat begrudgingly ) an appreciation for this new crew and cast of players . . . and , while I still mourn the loss of the legends I loved , I look upon them as new neighbors , of sorts ; with a certain measured withdrawn fondness . With the addition of an " Emotion Chip , " DATA is now an emotion-ridden , diseased AI personage , but in light of his not being able to grasp the concept of humor , he is willing to stake it all in his attempt to be more human . Also , this is the movie that first realized the potential we all knew was in the Enterprise , to separate into a " saucer section " and the remaining half of the ship . You could always look at the Enterprise and just knew that , " Hey , there's kinda like a flying saucer on the top front half ! " But this movie actually did it . It marks a milestone in the series and in this line of movies . I also must say that the way they brought Kirk and Piccard together was sloppy and puerile . They both deserved better treatment and so did we , as fans . They did the best they could , I suppose , but in ignoring Nimoy's suggestions to counter the plot misconfigurations and obvious premise problems , I can honestly understand why Nimoy backed out of the director's chair and left it to someone else . Had they listened to him , this would have been a much better enterprise . . . pun intended . I love the movie , and enjoy it . . . now . But when I first saw it , it infuriated me with the off-handed disposal of Kirk and his illustrious career . Kirk is dead . Long live Captain James Tiberius Kirk !

559298	2626332	78346	9.0	Rousing patriotism at its best	Even though it is almost thirty years old , this is still the lovable movie I remember . Let's face it , folks . For millions upon millions of fans , there simply IS no Superman , other than Christopher Reeve . He is the epitome of this modern day hero . In the shadow of the genuine tragedy which has befallen Mr . Reeve , the entire world grieved for his loss , and even today , we applaud his accomplishments . In the wake of the upcoming new remake of this movie , I am simply stunned at the news of this project . While a bit dated , this movie was not poorly done , as to deserve a remake . Move ON to Superman 5 , for in the continuation of this series and ONLY in its continuation , will the majority of fans accept another actor wearing those tights ! Yes , I am irate about this , and rightfully so . This movie is an icon for truth , justice and , although Superman belongs to the world , he also stands for the American way of life . What about it , exactly , needs to be retold ? Why waste the time and resources remaking a lovable classic , when they should be working on a continuation of the line ? This movie was the very best attempt , and the most successful , in capturing the spirit of the comic book character . And while some may not care about the comic book character , this movie is BASED on the comic book character , so to not care if it was like the original work , is like not caring that Adam Sandler is cast as the lead in " The Godfather . " The direction was wonderful , the filmography was insightful , the dialog was campy , entertaining and witty ( as it was meant to be ) , and the portrayals were dead on for the comic book characters . The scenery and sets were professional , innovative , and added greatly to the enjoyment of this production . The very IDEA of a remake is downright offensive and a slap in the face to the true-to-life hero who made this original . I am offended . Do they think by remaking this original , that they can start a whole new line ? I say , " H3LL NO ! " At least , they will not get a dime of MY money for a ticket purchase , DVD rental , or pay per view fee . Not one dime . While I would be all for a continuation of this series , I am steadfastly against the remaking of it . They will not remake 2 , 3 , or 4 , either . They will pretend as though they were never made . While in the case of 4 , that would be a good thing , as I like to pretend they never made that one , as well , how do you just forget about an entire run of successful , universally loved movies ?

I mean , not directly , but in some ' Six-Degrees-of-Kevin-Bacon ' way . " With the return of Gail Weathers and Dewey Riley , it hits both Sidney and Randy that this is really happening , again . " Wow . Nothing like a funeral to bring the family together . " Randy . At the release of Cotton Weary from prison , Sidney is confronted with him face-to-face without warning or preparation . Needless to say , it doesn't go very well , and leaves Cotton standing there with his face hanging out , still waiting for his " 10 minutes of fame . " Meanwhile , Gail's book has defamed Dewey and he is none too happy about it . His pride is wounded and he has an axe to grind ; primarily over Gail's head . His role is expanded and he gets far more screen time in this installment , which I found refreshing and his character to be delightful . As hard as it is to make a good sequel , incredibly Wes Craven manages to surpass the original and manages to truly SCARE us without being repetitive , redundant , predictable or boring . Amazingly well done , highly entertaining and a classic in the genre of horror . The suspense element is never cheapened , the element of surprise is always present and the performances by all involved is completely professional , believable and creatively presented . This production has well earned its reputation as a masterpiece in the horror field . The first installment of this series got an . This one rates a from . . . the Fiend : .

558713	2626332	74937	9.0	Clever , Brave Wit .	Delightful Comedic Parodic Romp Through A Classic Who-Done-It ! Cleverly Witty ! I'm not saying this movie is for intellectuals . It's for anyone who loves the old 30's - 60's Mystery Theater-type movies . Neil Simon hits another home run with this genuinely clever parody of the Thin Man mysteries , Charlie Chan , Sam Spade of the Maltese Falcon and Jessica Marples and Sidney Parole of Agatha Christie creation . With Sir Alec Guiness as the blind butler and Nancy Walker as the deaf cook / mannequin , it starts out making you laugh and certainly doesn't stop there . " You mean suicide ? " " Oh no . Mrs . Twain hated herself . It was murder , alright . " Jamesir Bensonmum . With this star-studded production , this movie delivers a solid performance from the entire cast . Definitely not the least of which is Elsa Lanchester ( Queenie of Bell Book and Candle , 1958 ) as Jane Marbles . The jokes , even when obvious , still make you smile and the wit is truly ageless . As you greet the guests , five of the world's most famous detectives each with an assistant or companion , who have been invited to a mysterious mansion for a weekend of murder , you are introduced to each of the characters and each actor's marvelous ability to parody the original personality after which they have been modeled . The approach of Sidney Wang and his # 3 son ( Why did I have to drive the car , Pop ? . . . " Because I smart enough to get out first ! " Sidney Wang ) is hilarious and makes me laugh every time I watch it . Eileen Brennan as Sam Diamond ( Peter Falk ) ' s " personal secretary " just shines . She shows how marvelously diverse are her talents as an actress , in going from submissive , to highbrow to seductive in her performance and in the end , shows the pluck to save Sam's life while he stands there and cries . The direction is wonderful , the cast is the BEST , the script is classic Neil Simon and the production as a whole is very Mel Brooks-ish with its clever wit and adorable innuendo . Wonderful comedy . The twists and turns are clever , the dialog is witty and entertaining and the sets were lovely . I often comment on the setting of a movie . I find the background sets and props very enriching in a movie , when there is even the slightest attention to detail . The house they used or created in the making of this movie was beautiful ; artistically furnished / decorated and beautifully architected . The cornices and moldings are classic post WW2 architecture exhibiting an almost lost art in this , the post-modern United States . You just don't see that kind of lavish woodwork anymore . Quite lovely . " The Haunting " quality . Rent It , Watch It , Buy It .

559373	2626332	118928	9.0	Highly superior underdog	Excellent , creative use of the 104M budget here . This is the supreme example of Mother Nature when She has totally gone awry . Beautifully written , realistically executed , and professionally presented , this movie could not have delivered more bang for the buck . Released this same year , was Volcano . It featured a better known , more dynamic cast ; more eye candy ; and just a tiny bit smaller budget . However , if you're looking for realism , action , and fast-paced well written story , Dante's Peak is the movie for you ! Linda Hamilton and Pierce Brosnan deliver excellent top row performances here . The scenery is beautiful , the effects are stunningly believable , the direction was astounding , and the whole production is even better than the sum of its parts . Dante's Peak is far better than the sum of its wonderful parts ; it is a riveting visual experience and a compellingly executed premise . It rates an from . . . the Fiend : .
558997	2626332	430634	9.0	Brazenly Inspirational	This is far above average for the dramatic " feel-good " subgenre . This work shows a creativity and sense of what should be right with this world and society , which lends a credibility to the work , itself . The performances , direction , story , and execution were all exemplary . I have no complaints , whatsoever . The header is about Haley , a street-toughened and disillusioned young starlet who has made some tough decisions in her life , being sentenced to a gymnastics camp as punishment for a crime . When I first read that , I was in no hurry to see this film , but what the description doesn't tell you is that the backstory , and subplots are so compelling , they draw you in and hold you there , if you have half a heart , that is . These performances and dialog are utterly engrossing . I think this movie shines ! It rates an from . . . the Fiend : .
559161	2626332	204640	10.0	Inspiring , Amusing , and Enriching	I am usually one who loves effects and huge KABOOM flix . Gimme Eye Candy , or get off my screen ! But once in a great while , someone will bring out an Indy ( May , Ginger Snaps , Brotherhood of the Wolf ) which grabs me and won't let go . This is one of those jewels . Based on small town life in Texas , this wonderful story rings true all across the Deep South of the US . If you're not from the US ( at least ) , you probably won't understand the truthfulness of this work ; how true to life these characters are . I honestly felt like I was down home , visiting my family . No other movie ( Sweet Home Alabama , Under Siege , Stone Cold , Forrest Gump ) has made me feel more like I was sitting in Aunt Mary's parlor , enduring another day in the life , than this production . They wanted to catch the feel of the moment . They wanted to expose the way life really IS in the Deep South . They succeeded on a level I have never before experienced . It was brilliantly witty and heart touching . The story itself was wonderful , the dialog was brilliant , the sets and costuming were inspired , accents were beautiful and not forced ( Jessica Simpson's Daisy Duke ) , and the thespians submit dead on portrayals . This one is not for the kiddies ( unless they are FROM the Deep South in which case they've probably heard and seen worse ) , but is wonderful inspiration for anyone who is homesick . This movie will either break you down and make you buy that ticket home , or will give you the resolve to stay put by reminding you why you don't live there anymore ! I give it on the Indy Scale . That's a solid on the A Scale from . . . the Fiend : .
559337	2626332	167261	10.0	A Masterpiece !	The epic saga continues , picking up right where the first left off , complete with hand sewn banners hung throughout the Golden Hall of Rohan , hand-fashioned armor and elves ! These works are perhaps the best I have ever seen . In the genre of fantasy , this series is seriously in danger of having replaced Star Wars as my all-time favorite movies . The direction was of the very best quality . The sets , designs , props and backdrops were realistic and without flaw . I highly recommend the extended edition , released in November 2003 . The scenes fully restored to their original glory before having some of the detail and story line left on the cutting room floor , this production is as " epic " as they come ; far larger than life . A task this formidable requires dedication , staying focused - both on the task at hand and in the creativity department . Neither were lacking here . I honestly found not one moment of wasted film , not one single element which should have been edited out or omitted , not one performance which was lacking in any way . While there WERE adaptations made to Tolkien's original literary work , I stand behind the creative decisions made , allowing that there were contractual obligations to be met , and fully and thoroughly enjoyed this darkling fantasy-filled adventure . This work , with its story set at the edge of the fall of Man , was dark and twisted , yet leaving us with hope for Mankind's future . I thought Jackson's work to be frightfully clever and wholly engrossing . This movie ( especially the extended version ) is absolutely wonderful ; a true credit to the whole industry . Too bad for us that Hollywood is not as bold . As did the Fellowship of the Ring , the Two Towers rates a full from . . . the Fiend : .
559551	2626332	83791	10.0	Jim Henson's Masterpiece .	This has all the elements of brilliant horror / fantasy : an ancient evil , a damaged holy relic , a clan of wizards , a hero , and a prophecy . Additionally , it has elements so far above and beyond the " norm , " that I am simply amazed that this movie does not have a stronger following . These elements include a conceptual design by Brian Froud ( ! ) , a renowned fantasy artist , and the costume designer from " Labyrinth ; " the story , direction , and production of Jim Henson , himself ! ; a musical score by Trevor Jones , the composer who lovingly uplifted the beautiful movie , " Excalibur " so high above the other Arthurian productions ; and Muppet Show screenwriter David O'Dell . ( Yes , he also wrote the " Masters of the Universe " screenplay , but we will forgive him that transgression . ) The effects were done by our favorite Star Wars effects people at ILM , and while the characters were done by the puppeteers at Henson's Workshop , this is far from a Muppet Movie , believe Me . The story itself is creative , inspiring , and amazing , yet darkly sinister in its beauty in such a way as to completely hold you to it . If you share a love of fantasy , then you will surely love " The Dark Crystal . " I am wholly amazed with this production , even now , some 22 years after its release . The flora and fauna , the textures , the set designs , and costumes , the creature designs and distinction one from the other are all impeccably done , with full attention paid to the very last minor detail . The designs on the floors , walls , and trappings are meticulously designed , created , and manufactured , and this story was so wonderfully done that I am in absolute thrall with this movie , as if I have never seen it before ; indeed , this is My first viewing as an adult . This is a beautiful , darkling , compelling , and sinister tale , so professionally executed that it is , without question , the most creative and lovely fantasy I have ever seen . The narrative is compelling , and inspires a suspenseful beauty which begins with the opening scenes and continues throughout the Gelfling's quest for the crystal shard which is missing from the Dark Crystal , but once he has it , he realizes that no one has told him what he must do with it . Without his giving his all , making the hard choices and sacrifices , their lives will cease to exist . Will Jen the Gelfling save their world ? or will the evil Urskeks win dominion ? Watch this breathtakingly beautiful production , ride the spiral of Fate and Magick , and find out for yourself . IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS MOVIE , DO NOT READ PAST THIS POINT ! ! SPOILERS ABOUND ! ! But there is also another perspective on this film . . . The " evil " Urskeks and the " Wise Ones " are , of course , one and the same . This is highly symbolic of the world's leaders . We are all human beings , we all have the same emotions and we share the same capacity for caring as we do war . We all have wisdom and a " darker ' " side . This movie is a sub-promotion of the One-World Government ; the New World Order , mentioned in countless literary works across the globe . The Gelflings , who are creatures very reminiscent of elves , are those small people ; the common clay of the world's diverse societies - the survivors of the many man-made , world-wide holocausts which have been committed upon nearly every social group on the planet , at one time or another . The Dark Crystal itself is representative of many things : hope , greed , love . . . all those things which are the driving forces of those in power . The missing shard shows that when motivated by the wrong cause , part of the equation is missing , thereby leaving the person only partially filled , constantly needing more and more , never to be fully filled , nor their hunger for the power sated . This movie is also a caution against siding with one or the other of the forces , as they will one day come together in a kind of peace with which no one will be satisfied , due to their disliking and strong dissatisfaction with the other side . It shows us that homes can be confiscated by governments , land can be taken away , as can life , liberty , and all pursuit of happiness , at the whim of the governments . The most precious freedom we have , as humans , is the element of Free Will , which the Urskeks did remove from the Podlings by way of the darkest use of the Dark Crystal . Free Will can be removed , even if only in the mind . Brainwashing does occur , and it takes three times the amount of time and work to deprogram , than it does to set the brainwashing into place . This is a very deep , sociologically and psychologically thought-provoking endeavor , which I also found charming , brilliant , and lovely . . . on the surface . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .

558597	2626332	171363	10.0	As Good As The Original , But For Different Reasons .	The house itself is absolutely breathtaking , the cast of characters is completely wonderful and the performances are purely professional . The effects are superb and the finished product is way more than the sum of its mere parts . In this jaded , desensitized society in which we live , it is growing harder and harder to find a movie which can really make you JUMP . . . rare indeed are the moments when you actually utter a small shriek and snuggle down beneath a blanket . . . from a movie . This movie is one of those rare gems of the horror genre . The house itself is the most beautiful example of late Gothic design I've ever seen . This movie is an absolute masterpiece of scenery , settings , dialog and effects . The story line moves smoothly and the characters were perfectly cast in this shining example of superb directing . I have watched this movie many times and have never found it wanting in any area . Since the death of her mother after a long illness , and a harsh betrayal by her sister , Nel's life has taken a sudden turn . Understandably , Eleanor , " Nel , " is having trouble sleeping . Upon receiving a phone call from a leading psychiatrist , directing her to a newspaper ad calling for volunteer insomniacs , Nel finds herself homelessly standing at the gates of Hill House , bags in hand . She has come to participate in the psychiatrist's psychological study centered around sleeplessness . The cast members are then brought into the plot one by one , as the psychiatrist introduces the " experimental story " concerning the past history of the house , and the story line begins to move . The visual effects here are far more than mindless " industrial " eye candy . These effects are absolutely stunning . You have to SEE the movie in order to appreciate how beautiful the house and how breathtaking are the effects . " I can be a victim , or I can be a volunteer . I'll be a volunteer . " Nel . As events begin to occur and Nel begins to puzzle out the reasons for them , the pieces begin to fall seamlessly into their appropriate places . This movie contains a certain . . . Agatha Christieesque . . plot , in that you can figure it out with Nel . You are given all the information you need in order to make the determination for yourself as to why the house is haunted and why Nel was . . . " invited . " I know I've gone on and on about the house , but I can't accurately describe the beauty and grandeur of it . It's one of those things you simply HAVE to see for yourself . It's absolutely breathtaking , and so is the plot to this wonderfully SCARY movie . - I - wouldn't want to live there , even for a night . As the plot unfolds , so will your wits . This is one of those movies that still gets my blood pumping , no matter how many times I've seen it . Every scene is a veritable feast of visual effects and psychological stimulation . If you liked the " Amityville Horror , " or " House on Haunted Hill , " you will absolutely LOVE this movie . There are no hokey effects , no trite dialog , no sloppily delivered lines and no failures in setting , scenery or prop detail . This movie delivers a solid , professional and delightfully scary end product which will make an excellent addition to ANY movie library . If you've enjoyed this movie , I highly recommend House on Haunted Hill , Poltergeist 1 and 2 , Disney's Haunted Mansion , The Entity , The Bat , and the original The Haunting . It rates a solid from . . . the Fiend : .
558619	2626332	254542	10.0	Awesome	For a documentary short , this is quite informative . We are given quality screen time ( as in the Making of Jurassic Park ) with Steven Spielberg , explaining the conception , the inspirations , the designs , and the execution of these concepts . Crichton speaks up , and we are treated with some behind the scenes levity featuring Richard Attenborough , and a total and complete documentation of every aspect of the Lost World . I found this documentary particularly enjoyable in that it explains how American audiences became jaded . We went from , " Can they do the dinosaurs ? " to " Yeah , sure you can do dinosaurs . But what can you do - with - them ? " I found that attitude very refreshing . While most people found this the weakest installment of this line , this second installment is , by far , my favorite of the run . I , therefore , found this authoritative work to be highly informative and entertaining . My only gripe ? It could've ( should've ) been longer . 53 minutes just wasn't enough . It rates a Documentary Scale from . . . the Fiend : .
558697	2626332	865556	10.0	Wow ! What A Story !	The potential of this work holds so much for a fan of martial arts and the practitioners of such arts , that there is little room for the director and the screenwriters to go where they will . Many fans have put much stock and faith in this work , and have anticipated its coming with such great relish , as to leave themselves open to disappointment . I am happy to report that " The Forbidden Kingdom , " does not fail to satisfy even the most ardent of those anticipatory people , and those who are disappointed by this work may have had no idea concerning the elements of the legend of the Monkey King , or may have had unreasonable or impractical ideas concerning the forefront leaders of the Martial Arts entertainment world . We expected ( or wanted , at any rate ) a face-off . Jet vs . Jackie . Jackie vs . Jet . The fans are given that for which they have so vociferously insisted . The work never once fails to deliver . In spite of the predictability of the plot , there are a few twists most movie goers will not be expecting , and the predictability lends nothing negative . In fact , it lends comfort by giving its viewers an almost-familiar story , even if the story is completely new to audiences . The one negative aspect of this work is that it does lean over the line of cliché in utilizing a young boy who must mature quickly , learn great lessons , face loads of hardships , and save the world . It's been done . . . and done , and done . But the vehicle whereby he accomplishes all this is fresh , edgy , and fun to watch . I must admit that this is the first time the " kid must grow to be a warrior " bit got on my nerves . Also , this isn't like some of the 80's wushu where they train for 60 minutes of the movie and fight for 13 . It also isn't like the 1970's flicks where the wire work is so sloppy you can SEE the wires , and the guy doesn't just fly on a wire , but he kind of SWINGS there in place because they didn't have the proper funding for good editors . Don't get me wrong , there IS wire work , and in the beginning I couldn't help but sigh , and hope fervently it would get better . The wire work in the opening sequences had me worried . Homage to the old wushu movies , or not , I was worried . But it cleans up , and all wire work after is nearly flawless , so there is no room for concern . This movie took Jackie Chan back to his ( 1970's ) " Drunken Fists " days , by allowing him to reposition himself as a Drunken Fists Master , and an immortal , while simultaneously doing the same for Jet Li in taking him back to his roots , as well . It has been some time since we have seen Jet Li as a monk / priest . Indeed , this takes us back to his early 1980's " Shaolin " movies . Yet he assumes the mantle beautifully , and transitions himself into the setting and media as if he has been there all along . I must say their performances were in unison to one another , synchronized to one another , and complemented while highlighting the differences in one another's style . The backgrounds , props , and sets were epic and detailed , so much so that they became intricately interwoven into the fabric of the story , itself . The Jade Army bore full 3-D Celestial Dragons on either shoulder of their armor , Sparrow's jade sparrow , the ornately and closely detailed Golden Staff , the Jade Warlord's throne was so beautifully designed , the bridge abutment which connected the Jade Palace to the rest of the mountain chain was designed with an artful creativity . The set design paired with every shot bearing majestic views of ancient China ( the entire film was shot there ) , designed by those who love Her and want Her to be seen in the best possible light , contribute to an overall feeling of adventure . . . and wealth beyond the dreams of avarice . All in all , this film is wholly engaging , and the 113 minutes were over before I knew it . This is perfect viewing for Friday / Saturday night , or anytime you want a GOOD movie . There is enough of a feminine element herein that the girlfriends shouldn't lose interest or have any reason to have hated it . And for those of you with children , this movie is PG-13 for sequences of martial arts action and some violence . One last thing . . . I want you to know just how GOOD this story is , and how WELL it is told . This rivals any installment of Star Wars , or the Lord of the Rings ( just pick one ) , in my book . The CG is masterful , the story is rich , the acting , dialog , and delivery of said dialog are beautiful ( almost lyrical ) . This is one GOOD movie . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
559015	2626332	60028	10.0	The Show That Changed The World	I love the original Star Trek . I'm a fan of the whole Star Trek Universe , but there isn't anything like the original series . Gene Roddenberry was a man with a vision . In spite of what were cheap sets , uncomfortable uniforms , ridiculously low budgets , and backdrops which were used and reused so often that the audience became intimately familiar with them , the performances were brilliant television fare , the characters were cleverly and lovingly developed , and the stories were socially aware , cutting edge content . There has never been another show like Star Trek . They have tried , and some have come close , but nothing has ever replaced Star Trek in my heart . Star Trek gave us everything . In that one , low budget television show , we got a hero , a sraight-shooting friend , a lady's role model . We learned honesty , integrity , intelligence , and friendship . No other show has ever done that for an entire generation , like Star Trek has . It rates a solid from . . . the Fiend : .
