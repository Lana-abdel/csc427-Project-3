559567	2626332	325228	1.0	I've seen koolaid stands with better funding . . .	And that just makes this all the better . This movie was horribly low budget , blessed us with the worst acting I'd ever seen , and peppered with some really horrid sets . Honestly , this movie is not fit to watch . It is not scary . It is not eve a good attempt . The only decent factor about this attempt was the writing . The story itself was a decent fast-paced tale of zombies created by a virus . While not original by any means , it was a decent production considered it had no hopes of anything better than going straight to video . Some straight to video ventures are actually quite decent . Unfortunately , this movie is riddled with the low budget disease to the point of resembling a third-grade film project . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
559420	2626332	277296	1.0	A Horrible Disappointment .	After the blockbuster hits of the Mummy and the Mummy Returns , I thought , " They at least have an idea of what to do with the Scorpion King . " I was wrong . The reason this movie is pretty well universally disliked is because of the lone , simple fact that the story did not detail the legend itself that was highlighted in the Mummy Returns . That was THE element of disappointment . Personally , when I went to the cinema to see this movie , I expected the same cohesion of story that we got from the Mummy and the Mummy Returns . It wasn't there . Instead , we got some crap about the guy before he WAS the Scorpion King . We got nothing of the story to which the Mummy Returns eluded . I was bitterly disappointed , and in writing this , I realize I STILL am disappointed in this movie . I don't care if it was well done , or well enacted . It was not what it should have been and therefore is a complete waste of film , in my opinion . It gets a from . . . the Fiend : .
558711	2626332	120380	1.0	Weak , flaccid King remake	Trucks . Another faithful Stephen King adaptation that doesn't work . Compared to this work , Maximum Overdrive RAWKED ! ! It was a GREAT movie based on Stephen King's " Trucks . " Stephen King even wrote the screenplay for it which is a complete surprise to me , since I normally deTEST his screenplay translations / adaptations of his literary work . Not only did he write the original work , " Trucks , " but he directed the movie Maximum Overdrive , and had a bit part in it . This made for TV version , called . . . " Trucks , " is about as well done as a piece of Steak Tartare . The acting is shallow and campy , the characters possess about as much depth as a child's wading pool and I'm SO SORRY , but I needed to hear Yeardley Smith ( Connie ) screaming , " CURRRRRTIS ! ARE YOU DA-YED ? ? ? ! ! ! " Brian Taggert should be writing greeting cards and Chris Thomson should be directing TRAFFIC somewhere in the rain with no hat ! Trucks lost a lot in the translation . A LOT . While Maximum Overdrive was not billed as highly as it should have been , this remake makes Maximum Overdrive look like Stewart's " It's A Wonderful Life , " in comparison . Aaaand , I'm not even a casual fan of Emillio Estevez but Timothy Busfield ? ! Jeez , why not get Steve Webber ? Wait ! ! . . . you already DID that . coughs The 1997 Made 4 TV Shining Remake coughsThe cellphones are from the ' 80's as they attempted to " date " this piece to compete with Maximum Overdrive . Why , I'll never know . It's no where near the same level of excitement . Yeardley Smith MADE that movie . Without her , it's just some dumb truck movie . It's probably not as bad as all that . But compared to the movie it's supposed to " remake , " it ranks down there with Mom and Dad Saved the World . Sorry Timothy Busfield fans . . . wait . . . are there any ? , but it just reeks . Amy Stewart's and Brendan Fletcher's characters were the only ones which had any depth or believability to them , whatsoever . Their performances were rich as French Roast in comparison to the rest , and that ain't saying much . It has some good spots , but it just isn't much of anything . When the TonkaT truck is killing the Postal Guy , we laughed uproarously . It was campy and puerile and we couldn't help but laugh . We actually rented this movie , to write this review . Poor us . lol And tell me this . . . Just how many times can you chop someone with an axe in the SAME place without going more than 1 " deep ? C'MON ! lol The axe actually FLEXED in it's plasticity right there in front of our EYES ! WoW this movie was baaaad ! ! Okay , wow . And when the truck drove through the old man who'd been Ray's Father's service mate ? The CGI is so bad , you can literally SEE the truck drive straight through the old guy , and the guy's feet are still THERE IN THE SHOT ! ! lmao We laughed SO HARD . If you're bored and there's absolutely nothing else to do , clean your house , clean out the garage or worm your cat , but DON'T see this movie . " They're getting smart ! " " Well , we gotta stay smarter . " lmao Wow , with dialogue like this , no wonder it currently has stars with the IMDb . The pivotal moments are weak and as flaccid as overcooked pasta , as the cast embers are picked off one at a time for utter stupidity . And the ending ? WHAT ENDING ? ? ? WT . . . ? ! ? ! If you like this movie , see a shrink . Okay , okay , there's no accounting for taste . If you LIKE this movie , check out Maximum Overdrive . It's much , MUCH better . I was going to give it a half a point out of 10 . I don't know why it gets that much ; perhaps in memory of Maximum Overdrive , a MUCH BETTER MOVIE ! But because of the really botched ending , it gets absolutely NOTHING ( that's ) from . . . the Fiend : .
558645	2626332	312528	1.0	Dr . Evil In The Hat	Dog the Grinch if you must , but it was LIGHT YEARS ahead of this muddled mess ! ! They were so worried about Carrey coloring the role of the Cat in the Hat , that they hired an actor who has one basic personality which he dresses with different costumes . This was nothing more than Mike Meyer's " Dr . Evil " character in a cat suit . He uses the self same gimmicks in his shtick as the maniacally irresponsible Cat , as he did as the irresponsibly maniacal Dr . Evil . There's very little difference between the two and what difference there was , he comes off as a very poor comic this time around . The creation of the city was quite nice and Dakota Fanning was a joy . The boy who played her brother and the fish were decent characters , but Mike Meyers ' interpretation of Dr . Seuss's Cat was extremely sickening . He was very under dramatized ( and must have been cememted in " Dr . Evil " ) for Cat in the Hat . While Dr . Evil was a likable character in the Austin Powers movies , he had no place in this work . Hindsight being worthless , they should have hired Jim Carey and not been concerned with the " Grinch " comparisons . He , at least , would have played DR . SEUSS'S character and not Mike Meyers ' character . The Universal Studios ad right in the middle of the movie was the least tasteful thing in a virtual sea of tastelessness . I actually PAID to see a Universal advertisement . I have just been violated . No . Really . Ah well , this will be remade in a few years , anyway . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .

It was a shameless marketing ploy designed to shove a second copy of the original movie down the consumers ' throats , regardless of whether they had already purchased the original movie , or NOT . It was George Lucasesque in its gross thoughtlessness for the fans , and Dreamworks was considered to be above those shady tactics .

559605	2626332	118460	1.0	The Fall of a Masterpiece ; The Death of a God	. : Major Spoilers : . The " Authorized " Version of The Shining : . Was a " Made-For-TV " movie done in 1997 to appease Stephen King's wounded ego over Stanley Kubrick's " unauthorized " movie version of his book , also entitled , " The Shining . " While faithful to the book , the remake was puerile and under-dramatized . It lacked . . . everything . Compared to Kubrick's adaptation , this remake had about as many " scare you " and " edge of the seat " moments as an episode of " Welcome Back Kotter . " Don't get me wrong . I have been an ardent Stephen King fan most of my life . I was the 9-year old with the t-shirt that read , " Stephen King Rules . " But that fact does not redeem this movie as the WORST piece of drivel ever made ! ! ! Other than to have an " official , authorized " version of his work , I cannot see any reason whatsoever for remaking this movie . It was a tremendous waste of time and resources , if you ask me . Ah , the movie review . Where do I begin ? Let's start with the casting . Although Rebecca DeMornay was a believable Wendy , her portrayal was as anorexic as the bare bones skeltal remains of Queen Nefertiti . But in all fairness , that's in comparison to Shelly Duvall's brilliant performance in the Kubrick adaptation . Steve Webber . Steve Webber vs . Jack Nicholson . Steve Webber ? ! I don't think I need to go here . I mean . . . have you seen " Wings ? " He's NOT my idea of an even . . . competent screen presence in a movie like . . . well , in ANY movie . His acting . . . " talents . . . ? " are much better geared for the " small screen " where he can enjoy the juvenile humor and poor emotional control ; be given short , easily remembered lines , with two weeks to film a 24-minute / 4-segment sit-com episode . Danny Lloyd ( now a mid-western school teacher without the slightest of aspirations towards an acting career what a loss to the movie industry ! ) was so very good in the role of Danny Torrence that I don't know who they could have hired to take his place and stand in his little shoes . However , Courtland Mead ( - " Young and the Restless , The " ( 1973 ) TV Series . . . . Phillip Chancellor IV ( 1993-1995 ) - ) CERTAINLY wasn't it . This child is a capable actor who probably followed the direction he was given , but his performance was sadly lacking . His character was hollow and as whiny as was Ms . DeMornay's but on a much more annoying scale . We'll blame that on the director . Who was the director ? Mick Garris . The same Mick Garris who also directed Stephen King's The Stand , Sleepwalkers , Tales From the Crypt and Amazing Stories , among others . So now that we know he CAN do good work , we have to stop and ask , " What happened here ? " Sorry Stephen King fans everywhere , but that leads us to Mr . King's teleplay . It was faithful to his original work and sanctioned by Mr . King , himself ; therefore was dubbed the " Authorized " version . There now . I do hope you feel better , Mr . King . I , as a fan , do not . We had the book . We read the book . We knew the book , and loved Kubrick's adaptation anyway . The Setting and the Scenes : A Comparison of the AuthorizedVersion Against The Kubrick Adaptation . . . Kubrick's version : the motel was an impressive piece of architecture and staging . It lent to the atmosphere , by having atmosphere itself . The furnishings and furniture was all period , and while the Torrences were becoming acquainted on that first day , they were told the motel was on an ancient Indian burial ground . The Authorized Version : the motel was a modernized prefabricated-looking piece of crap . The front lawn was small-ish and not very scenic . Also , there is no mention of a burial ground . There is mention - at great length - of a form of croquet which was developed by the man who built the hotel . Who CARES ? It had NOTHING to do with the story and nothing whatSOever to do with the plot . It was best left out , as in the Kubrick Adaptation . K : The maze was a magnificent touch , reminiscent of the Labyrinth in which the Minotaur of Crete was Guardian . When Jack Nicholson stands at the scaled model of the maze and stares into the center , seeing Wendy and Danny entering , it's a magickal moment ; one that tells you right away , there are heavy energies i that house ; there's something seriously wrong , already starting . A : Instead of the magickal maze , we got topiary beasties who wouldn't ( couldn't ? ) move if you were looking at them . This was NOT scary , either . The only feeling of " wrongness " achieved from these scenes , was in the writing of them . K : The several pan scans of the hotel itself , with the mountains looming behind , the cold air swirling about , mist coming up from the warm roof of the hotel , all adds so MUCH to the atmosphere of the movie . A : We got very little feel for the actual hotel itself from Garris's version . It appears as though he tried to not show the full hotel . Did they even HAVE an actual building ? or just a series of set-built rooms ? It felt as though the whole episodic monstrosity was filmed in a row of badly positioned office cubicles . K : The ghosts of the two butchered daughters of Delbert Grady were icons with which Danny could identify , and at the same time , be afraid of . They were hauntingly beautiful , and showed Danny how they were killed , in a rather graphic and material way . A : There were no little girls . K : The visions Danny had concerning the house gave you a feeling for what he was feeling and the things that had happened previously there . A : Danny's visions weren't enough to scare us . They didn't give us the history of the place . They didn't give us . . . anything . K : Tony was an attendant spirit , like a spirit guide which he acquired as a result of his arm nearly being wrenched off his body by his own father . He was . . . " the little boy who lives in my mouth . " He would manifest in the end of Danny's finger and physically spoke through Danny in order to speak TO Danny . A : Tony , Tony , Tony . Wow . To go from being an attendant spirit that Danny could not see , to a rather sloppy form of CGI , imposed over the landscape ; from " little boy " to teenaged-almost-man-boy . . . what a metamorphosis ! A disappointing one . While loyal to the book , in that King's Tony was the projection of an older Danny , sent back in a vain attempt to save his father , the idea of Danny going back in time to his younger self wasn't . . . scary . Instead , it seemed a bulimic attempt to bestow the tale with a haunting new-agey quality . It didn't work . K : The " Woman in the Shower " scene . It was dramatic , and frightening . Disgusting and scary . This is the pivotal moment when Jack . . . cracks . When Nicholson looks into the mirror and sees her decomposing flesh beneath his hands ; the look of sheer terror on his face was so complete and REAL ! A : The " Woman in the Shower " scene . . . didn't exist . That , too , was Kubrick's genius at work . K : When Wendy find's Jack's " screenplay " is nothing more than page after page of the same line typed over and over . . . when he asks from the shadows , " How do you like it ? " and Wendy whirls and screams , the baseball bat in her hands . . . is so poignant . It's the point where she realizes how messed up the whole situation is . . . how messed up Jack is . It's very scary , dramatic and delivers a strong presence . That coupled with Danny's visions of the hotel lobby filling with blood , imposed over the scene between Jack and Wendy make that the strongest and most telling scene in Kubrick's version . A : Webber's Jack Torrence talked about a screenplay , but never wrote a word . K : The " REDRUM " scene . Wow . What do I say ? What mother would not be totally freaked to awaken finding their young , troubled son standing over them with a huge knife , talking in that freaky little voice , saying REDRUM over and over ? It was something everyone could and has remembered . A : The REDRUM scene . What REDRUM scene ? There wasn't one . There wasn't even a sorry REPLACEMENT scene for it , and if there was , it was SO sorry that I missed it . Wait ! Could it POSSIBLY Have been that lame scene where Danny was attacked by the " dead " wasps ? Not possible . No WAY ! Talk about creative impairment ! K : Speaking of memorable scenes . . . Nicholson's final assault on his family with an axe was perhaps one of the scariest scenes of movie history . His ad-libbed line , " Heeeeere's Johnny ! " was a stroke of brilliance and is one of the most memorable scenes in the history of horror . A : Webber's final assault was confused , weak and NOT SCARY ! The weapon Webber uses ( a CROQUET MALLET ? ! ? ) was NOT scary ! I wasn't scared . l It IS however a memorable scene . I'll always remember it as the lamest climaxial scene in horror history . K : The ending . . The ending . . ? Kubrick's ending was perfection . I felt it ended beautifully . No smarm , no platitudinous whining , no tearfully idiotic ending for THIS movie . Just epitomized perfection . That's all I'll say on the subject of the ending . A : The ending was just as lame as the rest of the movie . It doesn't even deserve being commented upon , further , so I won't . I have two questions , Mr . King . Did you completely fail to notice that the TV version was NOT scary ? Do you fail to realize it is the most puerile piece of garbage I've seen on film ! " Howard the Duck " was " Casablanca " compared to this movie ! The Kubrick version , while unauthorized , was and IS about the scariest thing ever put on film , in the name of King and yet , because it wasn't YOUR version , you bastardized one of he greatest masterpieces of horror on film to date ! ! Was it worth disappointing your millions of fans just to uplift your own ego ? Frankly , had I the money to invest , I would back a multi-million-dollar budgeted Dean Koontz film . Perhaps " Dark Rivers of the Heart , " " Night Chills , " or " Darkfall . " But NOT a toned-down weak-ass version of one of the greatest movies ever made . Remakes are supposed to BETTER the attempt , not lessen it . This movie rates a - 0 - from the Fiend because it is the most grotesque , atrocious , despicable piece of garbage EVER MADE ! ! : .
559653	2626332	369226	1.0	Not Scary , Not Intelligent , Not Entertaining , Not . . . Anything !	I know I'm in the minority , but . . . Uwe Boll is about as talented as a frog . Not even a toad ; just a frog . He's reminiscent of about a hundred other no-talent hacks who churn out one useless crap-fest after another . This movie ? Is a crap-fest . Slater's talent is only minimally utilized leading one to believe he's got other things ( like his failed relationship ) on his mind . Reid performs as if she has either forgotten her acting lessons , been severely hit on the head and MADE to forget her acting lessons , or has one of the worst directors in the history of film . I'm voting on the third choice , myself , although the other two are always possible . Uwe Boll has never done a single thing from which I've derived even the slightest pleasure . Frankly , I'm satisfied that he made this stinker . I was concerned with Bloodrayne competing with " Underworld : Evolution " for ticket sales . Now , I'm confident that Len Wiseman has nothing , and I mean NOTHING , to worry about . This rates a rating for this messy , convoluted crap-fest , from . . . the Fiend : .
559470	2626332	85384	2.0	Greed is no reason to make a mockery of a cherished icon !	For some reason , people seem to have a problem differentiating this movie from Trail of the Pink Panther . At any rate , this work does nothing but serve to remind us how sad the world is without Peter Sellers in it . They brought back the same old favorites from Trail ( Dreyfus , Cato , Litton , etc . ) , but they introduced a misdirected Pratt-fall humorist into a role which was designed to substitute for the missing Clouseau . Dreyfus devises a way to produce the perfect copy of Clouseau via a hard frame computer system which factors the variables and tosses out the name of the most inept idiot in the global law enforcement family . What we got was a poor guy who was obviously overwhelmed by the grand scale of what Blake Edwards proposed he should do , and boy does it show . Ted Wass was amiable as Sergeant Clifton Sleigh , but let's face it . . . he wasn't Clouseau in any way . I realize that Blake Edwards was losing his greatest cash cow , but to disrespect Sellers ' memory like this was just sacrilege . Frankly , I'm glad they have remade the original . I hope it runs a long line of successful ventures for Steve Martin . This dreck rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
559474	2626332	63135	3.0	Not Good . Not Because Sellers Isn't Clouseau , But Just Because It's Not Good !	Many reviewers claim this production stinks because Sellers isn't in it . Okay , those are the Sellers fans . But fans of the Pink Panther series ( rather than die-hard Sellers fans ) may not have minded so much that it wasn't Sellers in the driver's seat so much , had the movie not been a completely disgusting spectacle . This work holds NOTHING of the wit , the humor , or the heart of the others .

559191	2626332	105477	3.0	Dismally Unfunny .	I don't know what ANYONE was thinking , in doing this movie . Sylvester Stallone ( Sly ) had a pretty good career going in the action genre , when he let loose with this stinker . A tough detective's mother comes to visit him , and promptly starts trying to " fix " his life , much to his embarrassment . For his birthday she buys him a machine gun out of the back of a van , and begins to further interfere with his job and love life , eventually " helping " him with a current case . Estelle Getty is adorable as the irascible curmudgeonly mom , and Stallone is average as a detective on the edge , but this whole thing came off like a terrible idea , hence the horrid ratings it has received here at IMDb . Believe me , it's earned it . This is just terrible and SO not funny . It's just kind of sad that Estelle Getty was wasted on this crap . It rates a from . . . . the Fiend : .

As pure comedic entertainment , this film is mildly amusing amid its racial inferences and sociological strolls into such a severe state of instability as to cause one to question the mental and emotional health of the writers ! With an uplifting ending obviously designed to counter the prevalent insanity , this film comes off as having a wildly uneven pitch . Although somewhat endearing here and there , this was only mildly amusing , but certainly not one of Carrey's best . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
559404	2626332	265104	4.0	Not visually stunning , but a nice idea .	Quite frankly , anyone BUT Bookeem Woodbine would have been fine in this role , but his portrayal as Steve Grant left me more than a bit cold . His character is a one-dimensional , whining , cardboard-cutout wannabe gangsta , and he honestly just does not cut it as Grant , which was a serious detriment to this film , as Grant's was a key role . ( And what was WITH those short , tiny ties ? ! Was he wearing a kid's tie ? ) Additionally , Adrian Paul as Aaron Gray here was reminiscent of a young , uptight Gomez Addams look-alike . There was nothing wrong with his performance , but his costumer should definitely have gone in another direction with his wardrobe . The pencil-drawn-looking mustache did not help , and neither did the liberal abuse of hair goo . All these elements contributed a certain air of detachment between the audience and his character , which seriously brought down the film . His character was one of those principle characters which needed to enjoy a connection with the audience in order for this film to work . However , Ling Bai's performance was very compelling , provocative and professional here . You may remember her as Miss East from Wild , Wild West . Other than that , this was a rather entertaining venture into the future of the vampyric race , in spite of the vastly missed potential . There are certain rules one must follow when in production of a vampire film . Some argue that these rules were created by Universal Studios when they filmed the old 30's , 40's and 50's black and white horrors . Others say these rules come from the legends themselves . Whichever the case , this movie does not seem to be aware of the " vampire rules . " The effects were less than they could have been , but were otherwise passable . The flash-backs , however , were just annoying , and the visuals lacked in creativity . The musical score was strong and contributed a nice suspense to the production , and moved between action and suspense quite well , even if it was overly techno at times . There are some good elements , but they seem totally unconnected and even accidental . There is little flow and less continuity . Yet the good elements are enough to keep you watching to the end , which is satisfying . Unfortunately , it's also satisfying that it IS the end . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
559048	2626332	113492	4.0	Cheesy and Glib , But Still Fun If You Like Blockbustery Popcorners	Judge Dredd was a terrible attempt at a comic book movie . Superman fared well for the first couple of movies , and the Burton Batman line did okay for the first couple of installments , and Judge Dredd does hold potential for a successful franchise line . However , this was done well before the current technological CG age , and it shows something awful . The dialog is trite and glib , delivered with about as much reality as plastic , and comes off like they were trying SO hard to have fun that they couldn't actually have any , if you can understand that . Coupled with the fact that this work takes itself far too seriously , Stallone in particular considering he was the ONLY serious thing about the work , Stallone comes off as an over-dramatized ego maniacal schmuck . A . Asanti does portray a competent villain , and Stallone contributes a decent performance , all things considered . I think it was more . . . everything else , that went wrong with this production . . . Rob Schneider , for one . Whose idea WAS it to cast that moronic imbecile in a Judge Dredd movie ? Is it possible that some idiot considered him the comic relief ? ! Not possible when one realizes that Rob Schneider is about as funny as a bad case of syphilis . He drug it down , if that is possible . The set designs were another thing . The budget existed to have built good sets , but these looked worse than some of the original Star Trek episodes ' sets and props ! In places , it looked good , but for the most part , they were pretty cheesy . Blend that with Stallone's over-acting , and trite dialog , Rob Schneider's presence , and everyone else just milling about as if there was no point to the plot , and you've got a pretty bad movie . Fun , but still pretty bad . The sound track and the plot ( when it is discernible ) are the only enjoyable elements of this work . Unless you're a die hard Stallone fan , I'd suggest you pass on this one . If you're a fan of the comic book series , do yourself a favor and reread the books . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
558817	2626332	1185834	4.0	Nothing More Than A Star Wars Bandaid For The Hurt Luca$ Has Brought Us	Before we start , let me say that this film did serve to flesh out the story a bit . ONLY a bit , but a bit , nonetheless . Now that I've said that , let me get on with my review . . . We'll start with the animation . . . no , I don't have the strength . We'll temporarily skip over that aspect and move on the the creation of the characters . Oy . I don't think I have the heart . The direction . . . we'll talk about the direction . It was . . . sighs . . . nonexistent ? I'm a Star Wars fan , and have been since I first saw Luca$'s epic on the big screen back in " the day , " but this acorn has fallen FAR FAR from the tree . The animation . I expected something of quality . This is ILM . . . Luca$film . . . for crying out loud ! But what we were subjected to in theaters was nothing short of ghastly . The work was so far from the quality fans have come to expect ( and rightfully so ) from Luca$ that I had to check into whether or not he farmed this project out to another production company . Nope . It was Luca$film Animation . So it's in stone . . . There's no excuse for this . I wanted to love the story , but I couldn't . It is so riddled with the pockmarks of " gearing up for the Cartoon Network series , " that it bore no qualities above that of the cheapest , most shoddily done , children's Saturday Morning cartoon . The subsequent series to follow may serve to give Star Wars fans more story between Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith , but frankly , I'm not ready to say that the payoff is worth the price . It was painful to watch , considering some of the less desirable elements including ( but in no way limited to ) horrible animation , choppy ( at best ) direction , no flow of story whatsoever , a young female padewan we've never seen before ( other than in fan fic garbage ) , a storyline which strays radically from the formula , characters cut directly from cardboard with a cookie cutter , and . . . did I mention this is some really BAD animation ? All in all ? This was a muddled mess , and I feel dumber for having watched it . Do something else . This wasn't worth my time , and chances are , unless you have no discrimination whatsoever where Star Wars is concerned , it won't be worth yours , either .

558940	2626332	356634	4.0	A Big Disappointment For Comic Strip Fans , But The Kids Will Like It .	I read the comic strip my whole life , and I must say that when this was first announced , I was mildly interested . Bill Murray as Garfield ! Wow ! But I have to say now that Bill Murray was the principal bad element in a long list of reasons why this movie disappoints . He sounds AND feels like he couldn't WAIT to get out of that studio every day . As a result , the whole work bears the feeling of having been rushed into production , out of production , and onto the big screens . Even the DVD bears that feeling . The animation is only passable ; another element lending to the rushed feeling . It was as if the animators could not have cared less how Garfield looked , moved , or performed . It left me wondering why ANYone bothered to come to work on this production , outside a paycheck . The human stars are cardboard stiff , and the live animals selected were done so in a haphazard , seemingly blind-folded fashion . The humans prance about the sets with seemingly no purpose , and the animals do not fit their animated counterparts . The story itself is trite and contrived , and the moral lesson to stand by your friends no matter what , is not necessarily the right lesson . Fortunately , this work was not universally loved , so the message is somewhat diminished . The dialog is delivered in that same breathless , rushed way throughout , making you feel a bit claustrophobic as a result , and did I mention that the animation was horrible ? And finally , our spider-loathing lasagna-munching feline is no longer an intelligent and witty kitty , but a cynical , bitter , crotchety mean old feline who seems to have assumed too much of Bill Murray's personal self to be funny or lovable .

558920	2626332	94288	4.0	Sentimental Contrived Schlock Fails On All Levels , Though It Has Heart	Most movie goers who have bothered to rate this , express their chronic dislike of this work due to Howie Mandell's presence herein ; however , I must say that he is no more a harbinger of death to this film than anyone else . The performances found within this film are all adequate , with some better than others , but none were lacking such as to lessen the worth of this production . The dialog delivery was also adequate , but the dialog itself was trite , contrived , and slapstick in its execution . Mandell suffers more from poor direction than a lack of talent . Yes , he was an annoying element of his hey day , but he never outright bombed until this work . Christopher Lloyd is better than adequate , but his usual curmudgeonly charm is lost here . Cloris Leachman's performance is the only contributing factor which elevates this work , but she could not save it , alone . The story had a good basis which could have netted a great film , but the National Lampoonesque take on the whole premise is the leading contributing factor to this film's demise . The story was watered down and sentimentalized to the point of generating schlock instead of entertainment . There isn't one aspect herein which isn't contrived to suit the story line , including the domestication of the lead character and the time line wherein said domestication takes place . A young boy is abandoned by his bratling brother and left alone in the wilderness to be raised by wolves . After his rescue , his brother ( still a brat ) decides Bobo must learn to read and write . . . immediately ! Intrigue ensues . Had this been treated with more care and a bit more seriously in the right places , this could have been a great comedy , but as is , this one fails on all levels : It does not teach , it does not ponder , and it does not entertain . As it stands , this work does show some serious moments , but they are in the wrong places ; the timing is all wrong , and even those with no sense of cinematic timing can feel that the pace is out of step . All in all ? This is nothing but sentimental , contrived schlock , which fails on all levels . . . though it DOES have heart . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
559646	2626332	249478	4.0	Nothing more than average	This attempt had all the necessary elements for a good movie . So where's the good movie ? ? This work does make the attempt to be suspenseful and entertaining . But it could have ( should have ) been so much more . One of the most popular of the " come-back kids , " John Travolta has exhibited extraordinary talents as a thespian , and has made some of the most unfortunate choices concerning what projects with which he associates himself . An actor ( among other staff members ) has to have complete faith in his / her director to produce a better than adequate finished product . It would seem as though Mr . Travolta has faith in just anyone . This director has a " spotty " reputation , at best . But in a field where the " hit and miss " ploy works more often than not , it appears that this just was not Mr . Travolta's turn . While his performance is stellar , he appears to be the only participant who has any idea what is going on . There is some element of suspense , but that element is broken too many times ; the spell is shattered , leaving the viewer disillusioned with no atmospheric redemption and this work as nothing more than average .

Unperceived family ties drag a young man into the gangster life . Unfortunately , this is pretty lame , in spite of the fantastic cast . What a monumental waste of real talent ! Every possible stereotypical Sicilian mob element possible has been brought into this production , but instead of making the individual components work , it flooded the story line with unnecessary " Italianizations ; " most of them ineffectual and out of place , clashing with one another , and rendering scene after scene nearly unwatchable . Sorry , but I didn't derive much pleasure from this , at all . If you want a good mobster / comedy , please do yourself a favor and check out Corky Romano .

However , some of these older works also have a draw as entertainment , if not quality . This is based on Sandler's " Cajun Man " SNL skit , but the character is developed enough to allow you to decide for yourself if you will allow this work to endear itself to you , or not . At least Rob Schneider has a bit part in this one . The story is not unique , but it is cute . Actually , " cute " is about the best word to describe this film . It's not anything more than that .

559459	2626332	97523	5.0	Fun the first time , but not worth a second viewing .	Rick Moranis has done some interesting roles during the path of his career , and this was another of those , but unfortunately , it's one of those feel-good kid's movies that fail to make you feel good after the first viewing . It was fine at first , and actually entertaining , but once the story has played itself through to the end , there is really no need to watch it again . This is unusual for me to say , as I watch movies over and over , but for me , this one loses its charm after the initial viewing . Otherwise , the child stars were competent ; not talented , but competent , in their roles . This is not an example of talented child actors , beautiful sets , great story , etc . Basically , this is a modernized remake of the absent-minded professor , without Flubber , enigmatic characters , great writing , ingenious story , compelling dialog , or even benefit of talented thespians . The one great thing about this work was Rick Moranis , but you got too little of him and too much of the stiff , cardboard-cut-out kids . I was disappointed . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
558750	2626332	204313	5.0	Darkly atmospheric , but not scary .	Is it because American audiences are so jaded , or was this work truly inferior to the original ? I don't know if I know the answer to that question , but the end result is the same , regardless : I was not scared . The " Behind the Scenes " story to the making of this movie is torrid and tumultuous . Director firing , screenplay rewrites , more rewrites , and more problems ; this production was replete with troubles from the beginning . " Writer-director Paul Schrader ( Raging Bull , Taxi Driver , Auto Focus ) has been fired from Exorcist IV : The Beginning after turning in a completed film , when producers concluded that the film did not contain enough violence . " 25 August 2003 ( StudioBriefing ) " Exorcist : The Beginning , the bedeviled prequel to the 1973 horror hit The Exorcist , has run into new problems , with Morgan Creek Prods . and director Paul Schrader jointly announcing Monday that Schrader , who completed principal photography in February , is no longer working on the film . Schrader took over the project in preproduction when the late director John Frankenheimer became ill , but he and producers James G . Robinson and Guy McElwaine ran up against creative issues in post production . " 16 September 2003 ( The Hollywood Reporter ) " Alexi Hawley has been tapped to do a rewrite on Exorcist : The Beginning for Morgan Creek . Hawley steps into the project to do a production polish for director Renny Harlin , who signed on to direct six weeks of reshoots after helmer Paul Schrader exited the prequel over creative differences . American Gigolo film-maker Schrader - who also scripted Taxi Driver and Raging Bull - had completed shooting his version of Exorcist : The Beginning when studio Morgan Creek insisted it needed more gore . Schrader , who saw the story as a " character-driven period drama " , was sacked and replaced by Nightmare On Elm Street 4 : The Dream Master director Renny Harlin to give it a more bloody look . Harlin then started shooting the $54 million prequel from scratch . " 19 November 2003 ( The Hollywood Reporter ) " Veteran director Paul Schrader is furious his axed prequel to 1973 horror classic The Exorcist will be released on DVD at the same time as its replacement - because he wants it to receive a theatrical release . " 16 April 2004 ( WENN ) So now , there are effectively two totally different takes of this movie . Two totally different movies ; not just versions , or adaptational changes done to a second copy , but two completely independent movies which are supposed to be released at the same time on 15 March , 2005 . That is just one week before the blanket release of Star Wars : Episodes I & II , two months before the theatrical debut of the much anticipated Star Wars : Episode III . While I call myself keeping up with the biz at least more than any casual fan , I must say that I've heard no publicity on this " lost " edition . We'll just have to wait and see . As far as the movie itself is concerned , the Renny Harlin version I saw in the theaters was dark and atmospheric . It was well written and decently enacted . It bore an appropriate musical score and it did effectively tell the story . But it was lacking . It was a bit limp and slow in places and just could not seem to muster the appropriate energy to achieve the buzz level it needed to do more than mildly entertain . I was waiting for the DVD release in hopes of a second viewing , but unfortunately , it made no difference . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : . Normally , I don't do this but . . .

558846	2626332	54938	5.0	Not great ; not as bad as some say .	This is a British rip job version of Godzilla which was filmed off the coasts of Ireland , in London and in the MGM studios in Hertfordshire , England with British , Irish , and American actors . Yet , even with the rip-off factor firmly in my mind , this was still an enjoyable venture into the realm of really big monsters and their movies . SPOILERSThe story line involves a sea monster , Gorgo , who is caught and brought to London for exhibit . But hot on the trail , is the mother of Gorgo ( who is also much , MUCH larger ) , and she is anything but happy . The film is shot decently except for the underwater scenes which appear to have been shot through a blue lens which made some scenes nearly indiscernible . The acting quality is on par for that era and actually , a bit above par all things considered . And the effects and miniature work is somewhat decent , except for Gorgo / Gorgo's mum , who looked a bit like a hand puppet in some shots and like a plastic child's toy , in others . In some ways , this film is superior to those produced by Toho , and in others , it is vastly inferior . The acting quality is light years better , but the monster itself was not nearly as well done as the Big G . The gratuitous British Royal Air Force cameos were priceless and as ineffective as one might suspect , as she makes her way towards the infant . The trappings on the island are a well assembled hodge ? podge of " Viking " relics which were not entirely accurate in their labeling , but we'll forgive them considering the budget and the production dates . All in all , once the decidedly Pekingese-pug-looking Mama Gorgo arrives on the scene , this is a pretty good action / monster flick . Just remember , it's NOT a Toho production , and there is no Godzilla in this film . It rates a on the " B " scale . That's about a on the " A " scale from . . . the Fiend : .
558922	2626332	74258	5.0	Although The Title Is A Misnomer , The Elements Are Greater Than Apparent On First Viewing	This work is horribly outdated , and that seems to be a prevalent feeling throughout the duration of the film , however , when one views this production , one realizes that many modern ( or at least newer ) horrors have borrowed heavily from this attempt . I have to include spoilers to demonstrate my point . Sorry . The isolation of the house and the rambling size , and the fact that the family arrives in a station wagon with a young son named Danny in tow , were all used again in 1980 by Kubrick in his adaptation of Stephen King's The Shining . The element of the father driven insane by the spirit of / in the house is seen again in Kugbrick's The Shining and The Amityville Horror . The Celtic TriQuetra trim around the doorway , the atrium full of dead plants which come back to life when new people come to live , and the fact that the house repairs / builds itself were heavily borrowed by King's later work , Rose Red . and . . . This work quotes other horror movies much like Craven's 1996 Scream trilogy . This also feels somewhat like Hitchcock's Psycho , in the end , although there is little to NO suspense generated , and the principal character is NOT a serial killer , possessed or not . The title is a misnomer in that the story is not that which the title would indicate . Oh , it is , but only symbolically . The family members are the " burnt offerings " made to the house , in order for the house to maintain and renew itself periodically , although they aren't burned , they ARE offered as sacrifice to the house . For so many elements to have been cannibalized over the years , one may be tricked into thinking there must be something here not visible upon first viewing . However poignant these independent elements are , however , when combined in THIS work , they simply are not as effective as they should have been . Some of the later attempts named herein were more effective , and more fun . This was one of the less dramatic portrayals in Bette Davis's repertoire , however there was one scene in which she grows confused concerning the heater in Danny's room , which demonstrated a glimmer of the Bette Davis we all love so well . All in all ? If you're interested in seeing where many of the more modern movies came from , this is definitely one you'll want to see . If not , then it offers little in the way of genuine entertainment , unless you'd like to see Oliver Reed in one of the most overblown ( over the top ) performances of his career . His portrayal belies his lack of classical training , as he comes off as a disgruntled Shakespearean actor . This wasn't that great , but contributed to some greatness along the way .

558938	2626332	100240	5.0	Not As Bad As Critics Say , But Completely Unnecessary .	The first installment of this trilogy had a beginning , a middle , and a satisfying ending , making this sequel as unnecessary as many other critics have claimed . THIS sequel , however , does mandate the NEXT sequel , in that it left a bit to be explained . This is really a convoluted , contrived , uneven mess ; bearing none of the original talent , thereby losing all of the Magick of the original . These actors are capable , but failed to illicit the same feeling of wonder , creativity , and awe . All in all , this is an exercise in utter futility , and was completely unnecessary .

559028	2626332	275538	5.0	Mildly Entertaining , At Best , But Not Horrid .	Surprisingly . . . weird . As a kid , I grew up watching Italian Westerns , what they called a " spaghetti western , " many which boasted a star or two and featured weird , twisty , nonsensical endings . This ran like that , with some big names , off color characters , and cliché after cliché . The characters are hard to know in the beginning , and harder to like , but as the story progresses , the characters are ingratiated to the audience , and the story makes more sense the further in you get . I'm not saying that made the movie good because that would be a lie . This movie isn't good . It is mildly entertaining , at best , with little to no moral center , but for a movie about a gambler and a conman , it wasn't horrid . Although , if you've watched the Trinity movies ( which serve as prequels to this ) , you will enjoy it all the more . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
558960	2626332	357507	6.0	Atmospheric but misses the mark	While this is not the utter bomb that " Alone in the Dark " was , it still left a lot to be desired . This movie had the advantage of carrying elements of both the psychological AND supernatural thriller , giving the makers an even chance for pulling off at least one half of the equation . Should one half fail , the hopes were that the other half would still carry the weight of entertaining the audiences . They were half right . There is a good atmospheric build up of suspense here and there , and some actual " boo ! " moments . But they are cheap thrills as the atmosphere is broken with each cheap scare and it never allows it to really go anywhere . The psychological aspect is interesting , but only from the purest clinical perspectives . The common movie audience will find it boring and over-done . It's simply a case of trying too hard in one aspect , and giving up dismally in the other . The performances here were not terrible . They were a bit stiff ; almost hesitant . I couldn't understand that , as this happened mostly in the most poignant scenes , going a long way towards bringing this down from my previous expectations . During the " filler " scenes where character development is at least touched upon , they are natural with one another . I found myself wondering what had happened with the rapport they had JUST had ?

Jon Lovitz was quite enjoyable as the diabolical megalomaniac . Frankly , this isn't anything but a baseball-centric feel-good movie , which minimally delivers the warm fuzzies , but does kick in a few Luke warm moments , overall .

While the action was good , fluid , and well executed , the movie never once loses its main focus : that wonderful plot . The plot is extremely well written . While there are two major flaws to the credibility of the story line , I found this attempt to be at least as good as Lethal Weapon 2 . I found this production to be innovative , fun , and highly entertaining . It had everything a good action movie needs to make it successful ; excellent character development , imaginative direction , professional performances by the cast and crew , a clever and witty screenplay with intelligent dialog , and action . . . lots of good fast-paced , well-delivered action .

Did anyone else notice that Chucky has taken on a somewhat Jack Nicholson-esquire-ality about him these days , and perhaps because of that element , we learn right off that we must not fck with the Chuck ! This time , in a military prep school , Andy is the hero , instead of the victim . What I like most about these movies is that they do not attempt to recreate one another . They play like one , long movie , when played back to back . This installment is no exception , and a deserving sequel . However , I somehow did not care for this movie as much as the first two . It is modernized , and they tried a bit bigger budget here , which spoiled the camp of the first two . They tried to add more of the suspenseful aspects of the originals to this one , and in My opinion , they fell a bit short in doing so . It does , however , have a darker feel and there is more gore ( one of the sequel rules ) , but somehow it just falls a little beneath the others . I think perhaps that it is due to the vulgar language used by Chucky . It makes him come of as an obnoxious bad little child , rather than the serial killer / voodoo bocur he was in the first two . It degrades his character's worth and makes it appear superficial , rather than the deeply disturbed psychopath who is trapped in the body of a doll , and is slowly going insane from the frustration given to him by Andy in the first two installments . I mean . . . what guy wouldn't go insane from the total lack of their wedding tackle ? The added darker elements should have made this one a better endeavor , but for Me , there's something missing . But it's still enjoyable , suspenseful , and even tense at times , with a darker atmosphere . from . . . the Fiend : .

Something I do find interesting about this work , is the fact that Ernest's Jack Russell Terrier , and many other aspects of this film , seem to return in a wildly successful Carrey vehicle known as The Mask .

Eddie Murphy's declining career not withstanding , this is actually fun to watch . Although this work falls far from the Beverly Hills Cop tree , and does not quite match the quality of any of his pre-1995 films , it still holds some entertainment value , however mild it may be . It is a modernized version , of course , of Rex Harrison's 1967 classic , but without the charm , the sophistication , or the talent . Unfortunately , while this remake is fun , it is only mildly so , and really quite silly in a wholly unimaginative kind of way . Frankly , the best bit was Norm MacDonald's " Lucky " voice part . Eddie Murphy's best post-1995 roles have been voice parts , in my opinion ( Donkey & Mushu ) . The young actresses who play Murphy's daughters are great in their own rights ; Raven-Symone and Kyla Pratt , the latter of which continues on with this franchise long after the rest have bailed , creating a nice outlet for her own growing talents . Check them out . All in all , this is fun , if only mildly so , and totally silly . The kids will love it . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .

558832	2626332	83598	7.0	Well , at least now we know what happened to Eddie Murphy's Career !	Apparently , many movie-goers were unhappy with this production featuring Al Pacino as a father , step-father , and foster-father to 5 children , only two of which he sired . Most actors stretch their wings and experiment with different roles throughout their career . Johnny Depp has been a religious experimental actor , seeking his niche , trying on new ( and widely versatile ) characters until he earned his stardom with the Pirates of the Caribbean series . Here , Pacino has spread his wings and , some have said , fell flat on his face . I must disagree . He plays comedy / drama quite well . This work features some dynamic elements , which helped support his role , namely the beautiful performances by the ( then ) child actors . This is , by all accounts , a feel-good family movie , complete with fairy tale ending , but the path to that magical ending is strewn with pit-falls , stumbling blocks , and other problems . It is far from realistic , but does not break the contract wherein we , the audience , agree to suspend belief and attempt to subscribe to the premise . Although I can't say this is one of my favorites , I do enjoy this work , and have found that Pacino is quite aptly cast herein . This work does , however , explain by what template Eddie Murphy seemingly molded his failing career . As one can tell by the reviews , action star / comedian cum family man doesn't play well with the fan boys . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .

558961	2626332	120654	7.0	Beautiful introduction to Norm Macdonald's talents	Most casual movie-goers do not appreciate the dry , sarcastic wit of Norm Macdonald . Many do not understand that his blunt , sometimes bombastic delivery is his trademark comedic style . While I would never call his style , " genius , " he is certainly a master entertainer , in his own right . This style of his is an acquired taste . If you've managed to live your life without becoming the least bit jaded or cynical of anything , you may not understand Mr . Mcdonald's talent for humor . His coloring of even the most innocent scene with a dark innuendo or low-brow blurb is just so outrageous that we have no choice but to laugh . But those who do not understand , will find him abrasive or crass . It's true ; he IS abrasive and crass , and in the most unfortunate situations he lets loose his abrasively crass innuendos and utters the most outrageous statements as facts only to correct himself by posing it as a question after he's already blurted out the first silly , obnoxious thing which comes to his mind . All this is assembled together with his honest expressions , common-everyday-Joe appearance , and expert comedic timing . Packaged within unlikely settings and a professional production , Norm Macdonald's comedic style is in the perfect element . Dirty Work enlists the largest range of Norm Macdonald's skills of any one work I have seen . It is virtually a showcase for his talent . Unfortunately , it is commonly viewed as " mindless , low-brow , Hollywood fluff " and will therefore never receive the full appreciation of the audiences it deserves . The casual movie-goer will not be " in " on some of his one-liners , and the hard core comedic fans will be too busy critiquing his innovative comedic style to appreciate it . This work involves Chevy Chase as an unscrupulous in-debt gambler who is willing to help our star out of his latest pickle in exchange for a load of money . I was a tad disappointed with Chevy's role in this vehicle . It could have afforded Mr . Chase's legendary talents a bit more respect by way of screen time . I found his talents were sorely under used although the drivers were pistoned after his specific flair . I did not quite agree with this decision . All in all , this is a beautiful introduction to Norm Macdonald's talents and I highly suggest its viewing . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .

It pushes the envelope in generating appropriate suspense , but it pushes it too far , as it takes itself far too seriously , while trying to mix levity into the picture .

While this is a more faithful adaptation , the element of horror is all but gone and is , instead , replaced with a slow-building suspense which lessens itself with occasional scene breaks and slight humor . Unfortunately the suspense never quite gains any true momentum and the result is a muted climax . That having been said , the performances in this attempt are light-years ahead of those in the 1979 extended Made for TV movie , much less the watered down , cut to bits theatrical release . While some of the characters we all know and love ( or love to hate ) from the 1979 versions are gone from this variant , the characters given are quite well developed and very well portrayed . I thoroughly enjoyed this version , however , for a better horror , I must recommend the 1979 Made for TV edition . It is much more atmospheric and is the full movie . The theatrical version was cut to bits . I really like this M4TV work , and I love the updated effects and extended story , but for a real horror movie , check out the original . It rates an on the M4TV Scale . It rates a on the Movie Scale from . . . the Fiend : .
559285	2626332	274546	7.0	Another Hellraiser " thinker . "	Following the same formula as Hellraiser : Inferno , this movie delves deeply inside the lead character and poses some hard questions to which he must find the answers . In an age of sequels and prequels , remakes and remixes , the Hellraiser line has remained untarnished . They have gone in different directions , given you the story of Hell , the history of the magickal box and the lead Cenobite , Pinhead ; they have made you question the reality of Heaven and Hell . This time , they make you question your own sanity . Okay , that IS a bit dramatic perhaps , but these sojourns into the horror aspects of the psychological world were really very well done . Not well done considering they are all " B " horror flix , not well done considering a relatively low budget , not well done considering the straight-to-video factor , but well done all around . The characters are well developed , the story lines are fantastic , and the portrayals are above average for these types of movies and for the most part , on par with the " A " lines . This movie in particular did resort to the cheap plot device of triggering that old gag reflex and , for the first time in a movie of this particular franchise , there were a couple of contrivances . ( Tell me that if your loved one was trapped in a car at the bottom of a river you wouldn't find a rock to break that glass , and do it BEFORE screaming for help ? ) And I do not enjoy gratuitous sex in horror movies . I believe if you have to rely on the sex to sell the movie , the movie wasn't all that well done to begin with . However , that did not take away from my enjoyment of this installment , which is a strong psychological thriller and a most excellent addition to the Hellraiser saga .

As the Summary indicates , this work is a fantastic bonding work for fathers and sons , and some may find it uplifting or inspiring . For those people , I'm glad . I found it more or less depressingly disquieting . It left me , and those with me , wondering what was the point of the movie ? The point , I'm sure , was to tell the story of the lead character . However , I didn't find it uplifting , inspiring , or entertaining . I felt like I'd wasted my time and money .

Our beloved Turtles go back in time to visit Ancient Japan where they must , of course , save . . . something . Honestly , the story gets lost amid the cacophony of comedic exploitive attempts , but frankly , I was happy that those idiotic genetically-enhanced snapper turtle and wolf pup weren't back . This attempt was more fun than the second , which I found entirely puerile , and while this one wasn't aiming at any awards or accolades , it was far superior to the last , but not as good as the original . Unfortunately , I have to report that the turtles are still 4 feet thick , and are still campy crack-offs . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
559294	2626332	365265	8.0	Stands alone well , but misses the prequel mark .	Obviously , this movie had a little bit bigger budget than the original two . It is better filmed , as the quality of film itself seems to also be better , while it carries with it a fantastic and creative story surrounding the girls ' origins and also their curse . This tale is beautifully told and is well enacted . And there IS a story here . Imaginative , creative , and well written , this production far surpasses the quality of the first two . While it lacks the charm of the first movie , it is successful in capturing at least some of that charisma between the two sisters ; Black and Red . This was an excellent addition to the series , although there was one issue I had trouble with in this installment . I'm having trouble with the fact that Ginger and Brigitte , in the original movie to which this work is a prequel , have no idea with is happening to themselves in the original work . Had they actually lived through the events in the prequel , they would know perfectly well what was going on in the original movie . There would not have been a problem , had they used a continuity editor in the writing / production process of this movie . How is it that Brigitte is no longer a " sister of the blood " in the original movie , and that the original work shows Ginger being bitten for the first time in the park ? It makes no sense . What also makes no sense , is how Ginger and Brigitte could live over 100 years if they weren't Immortal Beings . Other critics have stated that the Ginger and Brigitte of the original story were descendants of THIS Ginger and Brigitte . I don't buy that , as they made no distinction between the two sets of sisters . They used the same expressions and sayings and were , indeed , identical in every way . Therefore , the viewer has to assume that these are the same sisters that were featured in the first movie , who will live from the late 1800's until present time . However , unless their parents were also werewolves , that doesn't wash , either . The Ginger and Brigitte in the original work had parents . Natural parents . Ginger , at one point in " Ginger Snaps , " says , " God , I hate our gene pool , " in reference to their mother thereby negating the " adoption theory " readily believed by some of the franchise fans . So we are left with a huge continuity rift between the prequel and the first movie which fans of this line do not seem to care to notice . That having been said , the effects in this installment were much better than in the first two . The werewolves themselves looked fantastic ; however , the points above left a rather odd aftertaste in the mouth of a true fan of the first two , and did not balance the questions it created with the answers it gave . It lacked the sinister feel the first movie captured . It was dark , yes , just not dark enough to figure in with the rest of the franchise although there were some really nice killing scenes there in the end . Especially nice for splatter fans . Not as good as the other two , but definitely an enjoyable experience . As a prequel to this franchise however , it rates a as it never really explains . . . anything . Though it is slightly better than the first installment . As a stand alone movie , it rates an aggressive on the " B " scale . That's a on the " A " scale from . . . the Fiend : .
559594	2626332	91149	8.0	Sweet and adventurous	This is by far one of the best Disney animations . The story gives you swash-buckling action and a genuine sweetness . Vincent Price as Ratigan was a stroke of genius . He puts so much of his dark personality into this part , as to exude the embodiment of treachery . He is by far my favorite Disney villain , because of Price . These characters were very well done , well developed , and endearing . This is one of those older productions in which the extras like backgrounds , furnishings , etc . are drawn with great attention to the styles and details . This adds so much to these animated productions , and are sadly forgotten in the newer ones and , unfortunately , the sequels . The use of a Disney-esquire Sherlock Holmes was brilliant , and the absence of those annoying songs was a definite plus . There is one . Just enough . I love Disney . I grew up on it , and have a rather decent collection of Disney animations and live action movies . I also understand that some people enjoy them , but those annoying songs are a factor which detracts from the enjoyability for me and I am glad they left them out , this time .

558572	2626332	103241	8.0	Superb comedy ! Bill Murray's best .	This is a beautiful , quirky , bittersweet comedic venture , directed by Frank Oz and starring Richard Dreyfus as the anal retentive , controlling but successful psychiatrist and Bill Murray as the " almost paralyzed multi-phobic personality with a strong need for family connections . " I prefer Murray as the comedian . As the straight-guy , I can't seem to buy into his performances . Bob Wiley ( Bill Murray ) has problems . Life in general is almost impossible and social interaction is all but impractical for him . He fears . . . everything . A divorced basket case who claims his wife left him for Neil Diamond , he has no prospects for work , love , friendships , or any of the human comfort we all need . . . except the attention of his diverse assortment and long string of psychiatrists . Dr . Leo Marvin ( Dreyfus ) is the unlucky psychiatrist who is next in line in the treatment of Bob's many severe phobias . But just as Bob begins to reach out , he discovers that his new " friend " is going on vacation . In a fit of depression and mania , he tricks Dr . Marvin's answering service into giving the location of his whereabouts and shows up in the center of town , screaming desperately for Dr . Marvin . Dr . Marvin arranges to contact Bob at the restaurant in town under the agreement that Bob will return to the city . The Marvin family is surprised by Bob's knock at the door , and they immediately fall in love with his quirky , lovable character . Dr . Marvin , who is none too happy about this development , starts driving a wedge between Bob and his family . Unfortunately for Leo , the family fails to understand his concern and dotes on Bob , creating an even stronger bond than the one Bob has already developed in his mind . In a last-ditch effort to rid himself of Bob for good , ( and because Leo feels betrayed by his family in favor of a mental patient ) Leo betrays Bob's trust in an attempt to have him committed . By this time , Leo is a definite candidate for Dr . Buddy Rydell's unorthodox intervention . ( See " Anger Management " for the low-down on Dr . Buddy Rydell . ) This effort backfires and the results are hilarious and snow-balls down hill for Leo from there . The wonderful , classic Bill Murray style colors this gently jaded comedic endeavor . I thoroughly enjoyed this work . Some have said that it mocks those experiencing mental problems , but if anything , it endears them to our hearts . Watch the movie and you , too , will love Bob . It gets an from . . . the Fiend : .

The horrific scenes are never over the top , the girls are so realistic , they reminded me of dear friends of My past , the direction was extraordinary , the wolf looked good , and the performances are nothing but professional . This is a brilliant little " B " movie which I highly enjoyed . Top row portrayal of sisters who have that close bond . Beautiful movie . This was a wonderful story , given above-par execution by all involved . Absolutely wonderful . Usually for Me , a lack of set design would totally ruin the movie . But the story and execution over-ruled My sense of graphic design and I never missed a good back-drop . The whole movie was filmed between a field at school , a couple of rooms at school , 3 or 4 rooms in the house which was under construction and bore no resemblance to a home , and the county greenhouse horticultural department . You'll never miss the background here . This was a very pleasant surprise . Excellent job , compelling story , and totally professional performances .

559064	2626332	91431	8.0	Operation Condor prequel	Okay , I'm thoroughly confused . The prequel was released in 1987 , but the movie it prequelled was released in 1991 ? How ? But okay , we must move on . This is a fairly good movie , considering you can't tell whether it's supposed to prequel Operation Condor , or sequel it . On the box , it's billed as a prequel , but I must say it did feel more like a sequel , even though Jackie appears to be . . . younger . . . ? I don't know , I'm still confused . But that not withstanding , this was a fun adventure with excellent martial arts , a good story , and some other nice elements . The dialog was a bit stiff and unprofessional , but the story and the great action / martial arts sequences more than make up for that . There were some very good landscape / skyline shots here , as well . The photography was well done , the copy I have is clean and clear , and the filmography was nicely done , giving you good , interesting angles and the like . All in all , I did enjoy this production . Not was well as I did Operation Condor , but it was still quite enjoyable .

There are a few exceptions , but most everything he has done has captured some part of my heart . " Leap of Faith " is another shining example of that quality . As a con artist / traveling evangelist who is in it for the money , Martin exposes what that business is all about . The mindset of the characters , the motivations behind the " business " of religion . He sets it out on the table and calls it what it is . A con . As an evangelist with all the right moves , and all the right words , he can make almost anyone believe . Almost . But he is a salesman , selling a product . That product is faith . And if you buy in , he'll promise you the moon and the stars , and all you'll get in return is an over-abundance of bus fumes as he tooles out of town on his way to his next gig . The ironic ending was perfect , and a bit more satisfying for those of us how know what the business of religion is all about , and I couldn't help but consider that perhaps it was his character's final sales pitch ; unspoken and left to bait the crowds for his next installment . Very enjoyable movie . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .

Geared towards the young ones ( rather than the baby-boomers who love him most ) , Curious George was animated in the now endangered form of hand drawing .

The man in the yellow hat turns out to be a loving caretaker of George who finds him first amusing then annoying and then discovers he absolutely loves his monkey . Show me the monkey !

Although , after Karloff's portrayal in Universal's Frankenstein , I really don't feel that he has much , if anything , to prove to the world , but if so , he comes through as a career grave robber who sells the cadavers for fun and profit .

559188	2626332	102744	8.0	Interesting and Memorable Blend	This is a different kind of Western , featuring Tom Selleck as an American cowboy in Australia , Laura San Giacomo as a mentally challenged and emotionally shattered woman Selleck must save , and Alan Rickman as the villain . This is a general crowd-pleaser as it paces the suspense and action slowly enough to make the movie enjoyable , yet with enough action to keep most people interested . The gentle romantic sub-plot helps smooth the rough edges , and Selleck's ironic wit acts as a cushion to those sometimes gritty scenes wherein the action can get a bit rough . This film also lends a hand at showing the world that the Australian Aboriginies were ( and still are ) treated pretty much the same as the Native Americans were . I enjoyed this one , though there are Westerns out there I like more , but this has a great deal of original creativity , which makes it a must see for fans of the American western , regardless of the fact that this is set in Australia .

He took another path to banality . That having been said , this is one witty , exciting flick which doesn't take itself too seriously . If it did , I missed it , at any rate , as this movie is just pure fun . The drama is not compelling , but interesting enough . The comedy is not in your face , but common and amusing . The action was entertaining if not exciting , but the cast turned in wonderful performances . Tom Arnold's best role to date is featured herein , as is Arnie's .

They merely lay out all the evidence , give you both sides of the ideology formulated from the evidence , and allow you to make up your own mind . I found that approach rather refreshing , after all the other preachy documentaries concerning Bigfoot I've been forced to sit through . They expose hoaxers , and present the evidence they consider plausible , tell you why they consider them as such , and then sit back and let you draw your own conclusions , but after you've seen this report , you'll feel that the conclusion you begin to formulate at least are now based on INFORMED opinions , rather than simple belief or disbelief .

The house is a beautiful , wonderful work of art ; set after set having been meticulously created and artistically designed . The atmosphere of the house was every bit as dark and real as that of the Hotel in the Kubrick's adaptation of " the Shining . " I would have liked to have seen more of it , actually , but what I got was enough . This , another of many Made-For-TV adaptations of King's work , stands alone . This is wonderful work with wonderful actors portraying close personalities to those created in the original work , without coming across as smarmy or hollow . Reardon's Department Head is dead set on booting her from the Psychology Department of their university . Parapsychology isn't his thing , you see , and he wants her and her co-spook hunters out of the university for good . This house , Rose Red , is the only chance she has to produce real , physical proof that the supernatural world exists and thereby save her career . She assembles a rather impressive group of psychics to go into that house and possibly " make it come back to life .

559297	2626332	117731	8.0	First Contact ; a quirky , odd , and sometimes weak best installment	While this is not as solid as its predecessors , this is the first of the series in which the Next Generation attempts to stand on its own . After the shaky start that was " Generations , " this looks great in comparison . Based on several episodes of the " Next Generation " television series in which Piccard was assimilated by the Borg , and fought his way free . You are not given the benefit of this knowledge or experience in this installment . They elude to it , and even mention it , but they fail to discuss it which in my opinion is a necessity for you to get a good bead on the events and Piccard's passions concerning the Borg . In the opening scene , they have DATA stealing Spock's lines and that really just did not sit well with me . It was a cheap , slip-shod attempt to endear him to the fans of the old series in Spock's place ; a place , which I may add , that he will never in a million years be able to fill . I can appreciate his character for what it is , but not as a replacement for any of the original crew members , let alone Spock . And . . . Enterprise E ? What happened to C and D ? It was B which was destroyed in 7 ( Generations ) . So . . . what happened ? Did someone just forget the alphabet ? Or did they not care enough about continuity to bother with it ? Above that , the Borg have found a way to create a rip in time , in order to go back to 20th century Earth , assimilate the planet , and prevent the human race from achieving warp speed ; an event which effectuates mankind's first contact with the Vulcan race , sent to welcome humans into the group of beings who heretofore have not enjoyed the capacity for interstellar travel . Meanwhile , the Borg have infested the Enterprise and are in the process of assimilating Star Fleet's top crew ; Jordi La Forge has a new set of eyes which are beautifully and creatively designed ; we learn a lot about the functionality of the holodeck , the Borg , and the way some features work aboard the Enterprise E ; DATA is given human skin by the Borg ( and then given something else which is much more effective in controlling even the mind of a machine ) ; the inventor of the warp drive takes off running for the hills after being overwhelmed by the Enterprise crew's hero worship and has to be captured and returned to the project ; the Borg devise a way to send for reinforcements after their ship is destroyed ; and Dr . Crusher kidnaps the warp drive project head in an attempt to save her life . All in all , the story itself is well written , and the acting on behalf of the thespians is good , solid and even rousing .

559426	2626332	113729	8.0	Seriously Underrated Drama , Two Outstanding Performances !	This is a love story , of sorts , which conflicts the viewer in that it tenderly presents this tragic heroine and then shocks the audience by eloquently demonstrating the ins and outs of the moderate-to-severe bi-polar disorder , with which the heroine attempts to live . ( The mother states her daughter suffers from depression , but Drew's depiction does NOT indicate depression alone . There are extreme highs and bottom-dipping lows , which would be more indicative of manic depression or bi-polar disorder than depression alone . Not to minimize the life-changing effects of clinical or chemical depression , because I'm not . ) Drew generates a stellar performance here , and fully sells the range of emotions her character experiences . Her portrayal is dead on perfect ; in not just the disease itself , but her depth and range here is nothing short of phenomenal . Chris O'Donnell is not as lacking as some would make one believe . He contributes an adequate performance as a young man without a clue ; therefore , his character is vastly disliked because he comes off as clueless , and movie-goers associated him with the character . Go figure . This work is seriously underrated , primarily due to the unsatisfactorily heart-wrenching ending , but also due to the audiences inability to conceive of Drew as anything but bubbly and intelligent . She customarily takes parts in which her character is put in a sweet ( if rose-colored ) light , whereas her role herein is quite edgy and tragic . The screenplay itself is not solid . The flux is very fluid within this story . The only solid thing here are the performances by Drew and Chris , and the profound sadness and sense of loss experienced by its viewers via the execution of the story line . I actually enjoyed this , though the ending IS unsettling and fails to satisfy . It rates an from . . . the Fiend : .
558668	2626332	135659	8.0	Beautiful atmospheric suspense behind a darkly Machiavellian story	Quite honestly , at first , I did not know what to make of this film . Upon first viewing , it seemed like an overly-long , over-dramatized , superficial piece of cinematic sludge . However , upon a second viewing , I've come to appreciate the fiendish wit , and slow building suspense which is comparable to the malevolent Hitchcock-ian style suspense fans will quickly recognize . However , it does lack the subtlety of said director's style but gives you in-your-face evil in its place . These performances are really quite indicative of America's New England accents , mind-sets , and coastal way of life . Everyone contributed above-average performances , so there is no need to single out anyone other than Colm Feore . Colm Feore takes on the character of Andre Linoge ; the personification of evil itself . As a Being of great power and extreme longevity , his quest for a prodigy is actually quite understandable . However , the way he goes about it , was psychologically sound in execution , and provides him the very end he desired . He divided . He terrorized . He manifested . He planted the seeds of apathy , and he conquered . Very cleverly written and portrayed with a marvelously Machiavellian execution . You never even notice that it was actually , Made for TV . There was one issue , I had with this film . You never discover what Linoge's race is . You are told he is neither a God , nor an Immortal . He has Vampyric teeth , and lives a long , long time , but he is obviously not a Vampyre . He demonstrates some of the elder Vampyric abilities , but I got the feeling there was much more there than mere Vampyrism . It would have been nice to have been told . I must also add that the DVD version contained about 30 minutes ' worth of snips of scenes which the 2-tape VHS edition I had for years did not possess . The DVD version , marked " the Complete Mini-Series " thereby gives the viewer a much greater understanding of the details surrounding the events .

559606	2626332	102070	8.0	Campy Humor at its best ! !	This movie was supposed to be a big blockbuster hit . but it ended up as almost the end to Bruce Willis's career . Fortunately , that wasn't the case . The whole world likes Willis's acting , action and the characters he portrays . Although this movie was recently rated among the 10 worst movies of all time at MSN , I found it quite refreshing , interestingly funny and downright campy . I laugh every time I see the movie . how many movies can you say that about ? " Bunny ! Ball Ball ! " Just precious . The storyline is as follows . A Dominatrix ( Sandra Bernhard ) and her megalomaniac husband ( Richard E Grant ) are setting in motion a plot to take over the world . Willis's character , Eddie Hawkins , is the only person who can stop them . The plot is a classic and the laughs just keep coming . Complete with Andie McDowell as Hawkins's love interest , this movie is very entertaining . What other movie has " the guy on the donkey " listed in its credits ?

559528	2626332	205214	8.0	Charming M4TV Faerie Tale .	Although this does begin slowly , it picks up nicely and proceeds at a fair pace . This is basically set as a commentary on the idiocy of war , having set the Leprechauns against the Faeries over nothing more consequential than race . Although forbidden by the Grand Banshee ( Whoopie Golodberg ) , the fighting continues , as the Troopoing Faeries are the " natural enemies " of the Solitary Faeries . They have no pause to battle one another , as Fae Folk cannot die . Having no consequence to war , war seems a trivial thing to these folks . It is discussed with great dramatics , for to these wee ones , it is but a game of acting and playing , regardless of the caustic cause of the war . Once war is taken seriously , they still engage one another to a surprising effect , via the Grand Banshee , who is attempting to teach them to value their lives via reward and punishment . Too bad humans do not learn from such drastic consequences . Actually , this was quite enjoyable ; featuring some great performances , an interesting story , and decent execution . The story is fashioned after a Romeo and Juliet setting , with good contrast between the two opposing sides , and a clearly defined relationship between the involved couple . Additionally , there is a simultaneous romance involving the humans Jack ( Randy Quaid ) and Kathleen ( Orla Brady ) . Endearing characters , enchanting story with solid morals , and magical execution make this a near-classic . If you like this , you should try Disney's " Darby O'Gill and the Little People , " " FairyTale , A True Story , " or " Legend : The Ultimate Edition . " This rates an from . . . the Fiend : .

While this is not my personal favorite , it is easily the best of the line . As an adaptation of a classic work , as was the Muppet Christmas Carol , this zany recreation holds some intrigue , some good tense moments , and great laughs , while managing to project a strong moral center . With the wild popularity of Disney's Pirates line , I can see why a reissue of this work was necessary . With Tim Curry as Long John Silver , HOW could you go wrong ?

559145	2626332	120903	8.0	Dazzling depth for a comic book movie	I love this series of comic books , and I was not disappointed with the movie , although the character development I had hoped would be rich , was almost nonexistent , and there wasn't enough movie here to satisfy . It is 104 minutes long and needed to be at least two hours to enable some decent character development . While they tried , they fell short of what I would deem acceptable in this area . Other than that , this movie was very well done . The action sequences were rousing , the portrayals given were a good start in the right direction . The direction itself proved to be inspired , and the sets were creative . This whole production was executed in a manner which lent the darkling feel of mystery captured in the comic book , and some awe-inspiring CG-Eye Candy sequences made this film appear to be more than it should have been . The casting is one element which gave this movie its incredible success , but the effects and story were the products of a great and loving care devoted to the production of this movie , and it shows with each and every scene . This is a classic good vs . evil story with some romance , loads of action , a great story , and wonderful creative characters . It is pure sci-fi / action fan-boy delight . Let me also say that I highly recommend the X-Men 1 . 5 Edition . With over 5 hours of features , interviews and exclusive new extras , it is a bargain at the asking price !

559119	2626332	203009	8.0	Beautiful , Tragic , and Entertaining , If Somewhat Overdone .	This production received SO much press and promotion that I almost passed on seeing it . In retrospect , I'm glad I didn't do that . This is one of those movies , which knows it's a movie . There are several scenes in which the characters look directly into the camera and pop off their one liner . It works well here , though . While this work is replete with clichés and the dialog is particularly trite in spots , the production itself is really quite lovely . As far as musicals go , this is one of my favorites , and this version of it is probably the best of the 6 versions I've seen . Nicole Kidman is , as usual , wonderful in this role . Even her movies I haven't liked , I've always thought she gave it her all , and the movie wasn't lacking because of her . All in all , this work was very enjoyable ; tragic , but lovely .

558701	2626332	423294	8.0	Great Fun , Wonderful Innovatives for an Animation , and a Great Cast .	Okay , I like this . I mean I really like this . Yes , this IS another " coming of age " family tale told via penguins . Yes , this IS another animated kid's movie with a " message " told via penguins . Yes , this IS one movie's attempt to defeat a similar movie with its " awesomeness " at the box office . Sony could have actually pulled that one off , had it extended the budget to include some kind of ad promo that would have worked , but as it is , Warner Brothers is the clear winner with a near $400MUS take a solid year after the release of Happy Feet . But Warner Brother's budget was four times that of Sony's , and while Warner Brother's movie is fun , it does not quite have the heart of " Surf's Up . " Cody Maverick wants to learn how to surf . He learns , and finds himself along the way . That is the synopsis in a nutshell . The work seems a little full of itself , but only on the surface . The message is that being the center of things is not what's important . Family , friends , and spending quality time with those you love , is what's important . I think with Paris Hilton out there plaguing the world , this lesson is not insignificant . A beautifully stylized presentation is backed up by some awesome talent for the voice parts , a unique story vehicle whereby the message is delivered , and some great innovative ideas for actual delivery of the movie itself . The style is smooth , if not slick , and the finished product is more than a fun movie . The total sum of its parts is heightened by the blending , rendering this as one of my new favorites ( with Cars , Ratatouille , and Open Season ) . It rates an from . . . the Fiend : .

Lifeforce , Nightmares , The Mangler , Dark Skies , The Others , and so many more ! Written for TV by Paul Monash , screenwriter who adapted the marvelous TV series , " V , " and directed by one of the Masters of Horror , Tobe Hooper , this movie ( in the extended version ) closely follows Stephen King's original literary work much better than expected . While there are campy moments , and the effects could have been much , MUCH better ( it WAS post-Star Wars , after all ) , there are edgy , frightening moments ; moments where you literally hold your breath , if you've allowed yourself to be drawn into the movie . Riddled with " scare you " and " edge of the seat " moments , this film , while a bit dated , is still scary . I previously owned the " cut " version which aired on cable in 1979 . In writing this review , I purchased the full-length version and I must say that I was delightfully surprised . This version was so much better , followed the original work more closely , and added the depth of character development which the " short " version completely obliterated . In the wake of the remake to be aired in 2004 , I thought a fresh viewing of this movie was in order , and so it was . If you have never seen " Salem's Lot " in its 184 minute presentation , please do . It's a classic in the horror genre and will enrich your perspective of the plot by 100 % . Suspenseful and actually scares you from time to time . It rates an from . . . the Fiend : .
559421	2626332	103776	8.0	Disappointing but not dismal Burton sequel	The campy , carnival-like atmosphere above ground , while utter insanity in the guise of the Penguin stalks the city , beneath . Sounds intriguing to watch , doesn't it ? But Gotham City just isn't what it used to be . Gone , are the beautifully designed Gothic structures , replaced by gadgetry and standard , disappointing Hollywood fluff . There is plenty of eye candy , but that does not distract you from the fact that so much else is lacking . Has Burton lost his edge ? I wouldn't think so . But in this attempt , he resorts to obvious fifth-grader tactics to amuse us ; ie : the Penguin drooling black filth from his mouth throughout most of his scenes ( what WAS that crap , anyway ? ) , and killer clowns ( which were oh so reminiscent of the detrital film , " Killer Klowns from Outer Space " and the 60's camp of Adam West ) . While this production was still quite entertaining , it held none of the wondrous edge from the original masterpiece . I did , however , love the performances of the principal actors ; Michael Keaton as Batman ( Bruce Wayne ) , Danny DeVito as The Penguin / Oswald Cobblepot , Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman / Selina Kyle , Christopher Walken as Max Shreck , and that wonderful Michael Gough as Alfred Pennyworth . Their portrayals were quite professional ; the character depth was well developed and everyone contributed what I feel was their very best . What lacked here , in my opinion , was that lovely darkling nightmarish feel from the first . The Dark Knight having been turned into the Light Grey Knight , Gotham ( Gothic ) City was dismayingly morphed into a Carnival Midway , and the allowance of the horrid 60's camp at which we all groaned and rolled our eyes to creep into this otherwise darkly amusing production was just purely wrong . Sorry , but I fail to find having my gag reflex triggered to be entertaining . Honestly , I was still amused by this flick . DiVito's talent for acting is above reproach , though I found his constant black drool to be completely repulsive and it turned me off of his character totally . Again , that falls into the area of directing , and in no way cheapens his performance . Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman was mildly reminiscent of Eartha Kitt's portrayal and thus endeared the character . While she delivered her own style and talents to the characters of Seline and Catwoman , she portrayed Catwoman beautifully as a witty , intelligent seductress . Hers was a wonderful performance and I loved the perpetuation of the romance between Batman and Catwoman . " It's the so-called normal guys who always let you down . Sickos never scare me . At least they're committed . " Seline to Bruce Wayne . The attempt to humanize Bruce Wayne was a serious mistake . Gone is the edgy , almost sinister feel to the Gothic hero , the " Dark Knight . " Enter , instead , the comedic equivalent ; this reincarnation of a masterpiece . It didn't work for me on any level . Bruce Wayne , cracking jokes , forgetting his coat over some piece of fluff girl , and snapping off one-liners to the bad guys as he pretends to kick their butts . What a disappointment after the last Burton attempt . I found the change to be sad , rather than fresh or edgy . There were several points of this production that I found to be quite unoriginal . Penguin's plan to kidnap / kill the first born sons of Gotham was rather Biblesque and lame . The James Bondesque music during Shreck's party was rather tasteless . As I mentioned before , the whole movie had a " Killer Klowns from Outer Space " feel to it beneath the failed attempt to be Gothic and dark as the original from which this spawned . The voice designated to Penguin's computer alert system at the climax of the movie was very V'ger-like ( Star Trek : the Motion Picture ) , bordering on identical . And I've got one question . If the Penguin's army is penguins , and he himself identifies with penguins . . . WHY is he driving around in something as infantile as a rubber duck ? Just another contrived and trashy element I found disturbing and unattractive . " How outstanding ! You're Beauty AND the Beast , in one luscious Christmas gift-pack . " Penguin . While this production fell short of the first , it was still a fun and enjoyable movie , if only for the performances of the main players . I am frankly glad that Burton will not be directing the next installment of this , the " modern " Batman series . I am looking forward to Jim Carey and Tommy Lee Jones's performances . But Val Kilmer in the leading role ? We'll just have to wait and see . This one rates a from . . . the Fiend : .

559546	2626332	52357	9.0	Hitchcock was the master of suspense .	Everything , the musical score , the performances , the story line , the dialog all felt right with this production . The attention to the finer details given by Hitchcock was what really set this movie to rights , but it did not hurt that there was real charisma there between Stewart and Novak . Stewart , who was Hitchcock's ideal for the " average American guy , " was nothing less than stellar in his Vertigo performance . His range of talent shows an outright absence of inhibitory characteristics . He goes from the warm yet aloof " Scotty " to the angry and downright mad " Scotty " in such a pure believability that his performance alone is one of the major factors in My assessment of this film as one of Hitchcock's very best . But where would Stewart's performance be without the full-figured and capable talents of his leading lady ? Kim Novak was arguably one of the best talents of this film era . She was perfectly cast in the role of the mysterious yet earthy type lady of wealth who had a slight . . . problem . But , while her performance here was nothing but pure perfection , I must say I liked her character more in " Bell , Book and Candle . " This story is one for the arm-chair psychiatrists out there ; fraught with twists and turns , switch-backs and double-meanings , you could easily find yourself lost if you look away only for a moment . This is definitely a movie for the thinkers , and not the busy-bodies who enjoy watching a movie while doing other things . This story deserves nothing less than your full attention . While not considered Hitchcock's best work , or even among his best work , while he was still working , this endeavor has come to be known as such since his demise . To look at this now , so many years after its making and see it for the brilliance it was takes only a couple of hours and an adult attention span . He was so far ahead of his time , that his audiences just did not " get " the cruel irony of this attempt and as such , we nearly lost for all time one of the greatest masterpieces of suspense ever made . Only through the hard work and great dedication of those involved was this brilliant work restored . We are , indeed , fortunate as a society that this was even possible . IF YOU HAVE NOT WATCHED THIS MOVIE , THERE ARE MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD ! ! I loved the cruel irony of the ending . The fact that she had played him so freaking well only to die as her predecessor had . I thought that Hitchcock tried his best to use a fear common to many people ; IE : the fear of heights , in order to draw his audience in . I enjoyed watching Hitchcock's demonstration of Scotty's slow mental spiral as everything began weighing on his subconscious ; all the little details , all the tiny pieces that were swimming around in his head . It really looked as though he would snap , when in reality , he was quietly placing each piece into the necessary slot to make the picture come together for him . I also must comment on the use of the gray suit used by Hitchcock and worn by Kovak . It was used , IMO to make her all the more stunning in the evening gown she wore when Scotty first laid eyes on her . Everything else she wore after that was black , white or grey , to heighten the beauty of her in that one scene . Grey is usually a bad color for blonds . It washes them out and makes them look like they're wearing green pan for a black and white oldie . But Hitchcock did that on purpose as effect . Speaking of effects , the camera work here is simply stunning . That and the whole movie was nothing more than a parable teaching us to face our fears rather than surrender to them . This was the best in his suspense line . I loved Psycho , too , but I always considered it more the first in the slasher sub-genre rather than suspense . This movie rates a solid from . . . the Fiend : .
559503	2626332	120616	9.0	Fun and entertaining modern rethinking of an old classic .	What a wonderful adventure ! This is one of my ( many ) favorite movies ! ! Let me start this by saying that badly done CGI , like bad acting , should be avoided at all costs and should NEVER be allowed to be included in the finished product of any production . Case and point : the Scorpion King from Mummy Returns . It was horrible ; deplorable ; and just downright nasty-looking . He was no better than the worst video game character ever drawn by an 8 year old in green crayon . Okay , that having been said , the argument in the industry is that CGI is taking jobs away from LIVE actors and giving them to computer nerds . That is simply NOT the case . Case and point : again , Mummy Returns . Do you honestly believe the producers would have paid two million extras the standard SAG fees and make up artists for these two million extras , or wardrobe for these two million extras to comprise the Army of Annubis ? The answer is a resounding HLL NO ! My point is that before the diversity of CGI became known , movies lacked SO MUCH in detail . You either had the omission of the army all together , or about 20 shots of the same fifteen guys , all in different costumes , trying in vain to make it SEEM as though there was an army . Either way , what you got was deplorable . CGI definitely has its place in cinema . Another prime example of excellent CGI in use is in this production , " The Mummy . " The opening sequence of the WORKING ancient Egyptian city of Thebes is one of the most awe-inspiring film sequences I've ever experienced , but Ancient History is a hobby of mine . The only time I have any problem at all with CGI is when it's badly done , as in the example I mentioned earlier . It greatly enhances our ability to enjoy the story when the eye-candy is well done and in place . Those shots of the Army of Annubis are simply staggering . They look realistic and they are so well done as to make you believe , if only for a moment , that they ARE real . The love story between Imhotep and Anck Su Namun is a classic , and is as historically correct as that of Isis and Osiris , and while this is classified as a " remake , " I simply do not care to compare this epic to the original hit . How can you compare a true masterpiece of horror from 1932 ; a time when there were NO believable effects , no mastered technology of CGI , and the standard SAG fees for extras was around $6 a day . ( It WAS the depression era , after all ) Since the development of the technology used in " Star Wars , Episode 4 , A New Hope , " computer effects have evolved into a true state of art . I have absolutely no beef with CGI , its use , nor the use of it over live actors . As I have already stated above , my only problem with CGI is when it is badly done . In this movie , it was NOT badly done . I loved the " Indiana Jones " adventure feel of this movie . I loved the fact that they took a dark and dreary ( badly done , in my opinion ) original campy old horror flick and turned it into an absolute feast for those of us who love the eye candy . I am also an Ancient History hobbyist , and this movie really sparked my imagination . As I've already stated , the opening scenes of Thebes were so inspiring , I was hooked from the very first moment this movie began to play on the big screen . Brendan Fraser , to me , demonstrates his acting abilities in this production , showing his agents and all those around him that he is SO much above frivolous drivel like " Monkey Bone " and " Encino Man . " I hope he never EVER has to resort to such a waste of his talents , again . Rachael Weisz is a sheer delight . Her character is totally believable , romantic , soft and lady-like while maintaining a tough interior personality . Not easily done . Bravo , Ms . Weisz ! What an excellent performance ! I will not detail the plot here , as there are hundreds of reviews already posted to this site about this movie , alone .

559454	2626332	65569	9.0	This Has To Be Lee's Best Role !	I've been a fan of horror throughout my entire life ; introduced to Dracula in the late 1960's , I've always been fascinated by the Vampire mythos itself , as much as the theatrical interpretations of those legends . While I believe Bela will always be the actor most commonly associated with the role , I also believe that Lee was the BEST Dracula . Unfortunately , this director considers himself to be an " arthouse " worthy stylist , when in actuality , he ends up wasting at least 15 minutes of every film with his " arthouse " shots , which are usually superfluous and lend nothing whatsoever to the plot he is supposed to be shooting . Fortunately , this time , he didn't bother with that mindless activity , and delivers an awesome bit of horror . Is this the best Dracula MOVIE ? Well , not in my opinion . I'm one of those " story+great effects over atmosphere " horror fans , so in my book the best Dracula movie so far has been John Carpenter's Vampires because the effects were mind blowing and the story was just plain GOOD . So why am I reviewing THIS movie ? Simply because Lee's performance more than rates your time . If you are a Lee fan , or if you're a Dracula fan , or if you're a horror fan in general , this movie is worth the 2 hours ' viewing time just to take in Lee's brilliance . As I've said , in my opinion , this is by far his best performance . ( Loved him as Sauron , but this is still his best . ) Check it out , if only for Lee's Performance . You won't be disappointed .

Instead of being handed over to the Klingons for their version of " justice , " Kirk faces charges of 9 violations of Star Fleet Regulations , which further enrages the Klingon President . With the return of Spock to his native planet , and the restoring of his soul to his body at the end of Star Trek 3 , Spock now trains to regain his knowledge and makes an asserted effort to regain his memories of those who love him so much . The Enterprise crew must now return to Earth to face the music , as it were , but the music that greets them belongs to the sea .

559104	2626332	51406	9.0	Bell Book & Candle ; a fun , sweet love story for all ages !	As a Pagan , I must say this movie has little if any Magickal significance . It's a " fun " witchcraft movie and not meant to teach us anything except that love is the strongest Magick of all , and never to use it in a controlling or vengeful way . That's a lesson everyone needs to learn , not just Pagans . That having been said , this movie is wonderfully written and sweetly executed by Kim Novak and the venerable Jimmy Stewart . Hermione Gingold delivers a stellar performance as Bianca , Elsa Lanchester ( with too many movie credits to mention except as Ms . Jane Marbles of " Murder By Death " ) was wonderful as Ms .

Cloaked deeply within the secret underworld of those of the Craft , they live among other New Yorkers as one of them , without so much as causing a raised eyebrow . But then , along comes Shepherd " Shep " Henderson ( Stewart ) , a steadfast , no-nonsense , dedicated businessman who is engaged to be married to Gillian's old college rival . By a quirky mishap of chance , he finds himself moving into Gillian's building and is instantly " bewitched " by her charm and grace . By the use of Magick , with a little help from Pyewacket ( Gillian's familiar , trained by Robert E . Blair ) and Queenie , Gillian begins to work on this handsome new dream man to get back at her old enemy . But Magick should never be used to control , nor to hurt , and Gillian learns that the hard way in the most bittersweet way . Not only does she have to face what she's done , but she has to face Shep in her guilt . From the critical perspective ; however , the movie takes a serious turn : The effects are very dated to the point of being pure camp . Some of the scenery was seemingly shot in the basement of someone's small home , but at least the characters were quirky and fun . On a personal note , Pyewacket steals the show . Great cat ! Great training by Robert E . Blair . As a Note of Trivia , this is the roots for the beloved Bewitched television sitcom . This introduces the original Samantha and Darrin . All the characters of note are present and accounted for . You have but to look , to see it for yourself . This is one of my favorites , and I watch it often .

558812	2626332	73195	9.0	Above Par Creature Feature	Jaws is legendary , as the epitome of classic-modern horror . It is so wildly popular , as to have thoroughly permeated into the heart of American pop-culture . And while it wasn't his first , it was certainly Steven Spielberg's first large budget , and his first hit , propelling his career into the mega-success he is today . . . and with good reason . This work captured the fear of every movie goer for a decade . The atmosphere generated herein is downright Hitchcockian in essence , while the story is compellingly dead on for how a small business-minded town would handle this situation . The dialog is superb , and the performances are above par for this type of movie . This work went a long way towards re-legitimizing the horror genre among the average movie-goer and critics , alike . Although it IS a bit dated now , it still ranks up there in the highest echelon of creature features , right alongside Alien , Predator , and the old Universal Horrors .

559266	2626332	413300	9.0	Clearly the Best . . . and Hopefully the End	When it comes to Spider-man , Raimi clearly knows his business ! I was a bit apprehensive when I saw the black suit . I already knew that the Green Goblin 2 would be involved , there was the back story and sub-plotted love triangle romance between Parker , MJ , and Osborne , Sandman was cast , and the black Spidey-suit clearly indicated the Venom storyline ( a fact highly debated here on the IMDb boards , but I KNEW ; ) ) Subsequently , I was afraid Sam was going to try to do too much with this film . My worry was for naught . This movie skillfully meshes the complete , intricately woven web of intrigue , suspense , action , drama , and romance into one beautiful gossamer masterpiece , with the exception of the dysfunctional relationship element . I know much of the lure to Spiderman is that he is a regular guy who makes mistakes in the relationship department , can't hold a job , has an awkward relationship with his only living relative , and makes other mistakes too many to mention , but the dysfunctional aspects were too heightened here to garner appreciation and sympathy towards the lead character . In fact , they were a put off to this work . There IS one other aspect I can't say I loved : The CGI treatment was discernible . I think when CGI is prolifically used , it should be used well , and not be blatantly obvious to the untrained eye . In several places in this film , it was just that . . . not used well , and blatantly obvious to anyone looking . . . but again , it was only in places . It wasn't enough to bring down the whole movie . It DID serve to distract , however . I won't detail the plot as so many have done . Suffice it to say that this was the perfect ending to this franchise . End it now , before it can suffer franchise sickness and bad installments . This was pure perfection . Let's leave it to graze majestically . There has been some buzz around Hollywood concerning Spider-man 4 . Frankly , this movie closes all the necessary gaps and winds things up in a satisfactory conclusion . I see no reason to continue this franchise . End it on a high note , and let it go in glory . Please . But , Raimi seems to have moved on to other projects . He has recently sold a M4TV movie idea to Terry Goodkind , concerning his widely popular series , " The Sword of Truth Novels , " namely " Wizard's First Rule . " And , if the rumors are true , Raimi has been approached by New Line's Bob Shaye concerning direction of the impending Peter Jacksonless Hobbit endeavor . Let's hope Raimi has the sense to pass on that one ! Half the world would hate him ! At least , Jackson fans would , and that equates many , many movie-goers to boycott that work .

559360	2626332	95159	9.0	The funniest rom-com ever	Four jewel thieves pull off the heist of a lifetime , and immediately begin screwing each other over for the loot . Full of twists and turns and some of truly wonderful performances combine to create one of the funniest farces to be put on screen . This movie won Kevin Kline the best supporting actor Oscar . It also enjoyed 6 other wins and 15 nominations , and deservedly so ! This is the funniest rom-com ever made . Totally wonderful performances from a star-studded comedic cast showcase this huge hit from 1988 . The sheer class of this production was perpetuated by the seeming comfort with one another exhibited by these actors . It appeared as though they really were fast friends , lovers , would-be lovers , and has-been lovers . While the production itself was suspenseful and witty , the relationships were relaxed and easy and played out just as if they were real . Kevin Kline was delightful as the psychotic , sex-crazed , boot-sniffing , insanely jealous lover . He was completely believable in this inventive role as Jamie Lee Curtis ' diabolical lover , pretending to be her brother , pretending to be interested in Ken . John Cleese's character was soft and sweet , and totally endearing , while Jamie Lee Curtis ( AKA : Wanda ) demonstrated pure talent as the obvious , borderline Machiavellian seductress . There wasn't one moment of wasted film , one mis-timed scene , or one lapse in performance quality . Every comedy should aim for the standards set in this work . These types of movies either have it , or they don't . There are no effects behind which to hide poor performances . There is no glitz to disguise a lack of talent or comedic timing . There is simply the actor and the camera . Nothing to color the performances but the director and the score . These types of vehicles are where you discover the true talent of the ages .

558647	2626332	315983	9.0	Bad timing for an otherwise worthy endeavor .	The timing was all wrong for a movie of this kind ; otherwise , it would have been a good endeavor . I really don't know how anyone else feels , but in the days of trials and tribulations , when hundreds of thousands of Americans have no idea from month to month if their children , husbands and wives , mothers and fathers on middle eastern soil are dead or alive , this was the wrong time to release an Iranian-sympathetic movie with an American police officer and a displaced homemaker as the " bad guys . " It struck a nerve with me , and I'm sure the same can be said by other millions who were not flocking to see this movie . With an estimated $16M-US budget and a $45 . 6K-US opening weekend , this movie has just barely come below its estimated budget at a $13M-US total return . That is not a fair estimation of this movie's power , as those who HAVE seen it have it rated at a decent 7 . 6 here at IMDb and , in fact , it IS well done . This work is powerful and compelling . It certainly isn't the fault of the movie itself that the subject matter is a poor choice for this time in American lives . I would be willing to bet that Sadowsky will more closely screen her projects from this attempt , on . As executive producer , it was her job to see that this movie was released in a more middle-eastern sympathetic time than tumultuous 2003 . It is a real tragedy , as this was a highly provocative endeavor which passes all the tests . You have characters with which you can sympathize ( on both sides of the equation ) , you have good direction , a rousing and eerily delivered score , good dialog , and a good story . Just horrible timing of its release . As I said , this should have waited several years for a more well received release . This is possibly some of Jennifer Connelly's best work . She delivers a very strong performance ; unfortunately , practically no one has seen it . And I have to say that Shohreh Aghdashloo gave a solid performance as the wife of the man you wanted to hate , but couldn't . Very nice ! I am curious as to where her career leads her . All in all this one rates an from . . . the Fiend : .
558949	2626332	86190	9.0	Good , But Not As Good As The First Two	This time , directed by Richard Marquand with Lawrence Kasdan writing the screenplay once more based on Luca$'s original work . Well here we are . I must say that this is my least favorite of the Original Trilogy . It is a wonderful story , the great original cast from the first two ( Episodes 4 & 5 ) , and the story is excellent . The execution is superb , and the entertainment value is every bit as good as those before it . That having been said , I'll also say from the start , that the reason I like this installment much less was the addition of the child-friendly Ewoks and their subsequent marketability . It was a cheap and obvious ploy to market yet another Star Wars toy . It worked , but it was still cheap and common . I am very dissatisfied with this practice . If a character " sells , " then fine . But do NOT create a character , or as in this case , a group of characters merely to up-sell the merchandise . Okay , I'm done with that . This third installment ( which works out to be the sixth of the series ) was fun , and spirited . The dark and suspenseful atmosphere built by the story is negated by too many " light " and warm , fuzzy moments , thereby lessening the worth of this attempt . It was not the deeply pondering , mystically oriented , action-fest as were the previous two blockbusters . It was still fun , however . Enjoyable and entertaining , it was . In the 2004 DVD edition , there are superfluous additional scenes designed to distract you from the realization that there was a blatant waste of film time present , but that ploy fails to work if you are like me , and own the original original on VHS . That smoke screen is not evident , and these contrivances are thereby more obvious . This installment is colored with beautiful vistas , rousing action , and a quiet sentimentality which permeates all . Yoda is old , and he is sick . Skywalker is done with his training as a Jedi , save for one small final test : He must face Vader once and for all . There are some added scenes and characters in the background of this installment ; edited in no doubt for the DVD release of the 2004 box set . These were undoubtedly designed to lead us into the third trilogy which Luca$ now says will never happen . If watching through that media , you will doubtless see clandestine meetings and furtive exchanges which lead no where in this work , leading one to only suppose that Luca$ intended something , we just were not supposed to know what . And yet , Luca$ neither directed , nor wrote this work , so we can only assume the writer was going off of the fact that there were three more Episodes for which to write tie ? ins . As much as I disliked the Ewoks , I must say that I was delighted to discover that Warwick Davis , beloved Willow , was Wicket the Ewok . That makes them almost bearable . " Ewoks . They blow .

559419	2626332	134084	9.0	Deserving concluding trilogy chapter	While fully exploited and mimicked by every hack writer / director throughout the movie industry , this is series stands alone . . . without peer . This last installment of the " Scream " trilogy perpetuates the wonderfully creative job Wes Craven did in the first two . I expected the typical campy , slip-shod third installment that we usually get from Hollywood . Typically , the third ones are the worst . ( Halloween 3 , for example , Batman 3 , Indiana Jones 3 , Jurassic Park 3 all fell short of the first two installments of their series . ) Again , the original cast is back . I admire that tremendously in any series , but in this one especially , as the acting quality and chemistry between these thespians is absolute magic . Randy ( Jamie Kennedy ) explains to his friends , his extended family , what a trilogy is all about . In doing so , he points out that this movie that is their life , is the " concluding chapter of . . . ( their ) . . . trilogy . " This touch added immensely to the understanding of the facts . This movie brings together the first two movies and effectively illuminates all the evidential pieces , drawing them into a solid , cohesive story . While this last installment was a bit less shocking and scary than the first two , it was only by an infinitesimal amount . Randy's explanation is one of the key factors in the " drawing together " process around which this movie centers . " If you find yourself dealing with an unexpected back-story and a preponderance of exposition , then the sequel rules do NOT apply . Because you are not dealing with the sequel . You are dealing with the concluding chapter of a trilogy . . . true trilogies are all about going back to the beginning , and discovering something that wasn't true from the get-go . Godfather , Jedi all revealed something that we thought was true , that wasn't true . So if it is a trilogy you are dealing with , here are some super trilogy rules . ( 1 ) You've got a killer who's going to be superhuman . Stabbing him won't work , shooting him won't work , basically you've got to cryogenically freeze his head , decapitate him , or blow him up . ( 2 ) Anyone , including the main character , can die . This means you , Sid . I'm sorry . It's the final chapter . It could be fkin ' Reservoir dogs by the time this thing is through . ( 3 ) The past will come back to bite you in the @ ss . Whatever you think you know about the past , forget it . The past is not at rest ! Any sins you think were committed in the past are about to break out and destroy you . " Randy . The new characters are just as well-developed as the originals , the plot is extremely well written and hugely effective in promoting the central purpose of this final film ; that of explaining everything and bringing all thoughts , ideas and facts together . In the beginning , I thought that the character of Jennifer Jolie , portrayed by Parker Posey , was hollow , shallow and ineffective . But upon further contemplation , I realized that was true only when she was in her role as Gale Weathers . Her interpretation of Gale's personality was that GALE was hollow , shallow and unprofessional . When she is out of that character , and in her own as Jennifer , her performance is extremely good . That original thought , alone , made me dislike the entire movie . Wes Craven's characters up until that point were all very professionally developed and portrayed . I could not understand his allowing a horrid performance to grace these movies . But in retrospect , it was not like that at all . The characters portraying actors , when in the roles the actors portray , all seem lacking , but I think perhaps that may be Craven's personal comment concerning the recent run of massively ill-done rip-off's of the " Scream " masterpieces , and not poor performances by these actors . The rip-off's , such as " Cut " and " Urban Legend : Final Cut , " are horrid , obvious attempts to mimic the brilliance Craven presents to us . I don't blame him one bit . I would have written in a few snide comments , myself . Probably quite a bit more bold than this . The guest star appearances of Jay and Silent Bob was a lovely touch , by the way . PLOT : Sidney is " living in the mountains like the UniBomber , " in an attempt to have some vestige of a life . " Killers can't kill what they can't find . " Sidney . She works as a counselor for a crisis call center , and can do this out of her home . Meanwhile , back in the city , the killings have resumed , and the case has been given to Det . Mark Kincaid of the LAPD ( Patrick Dempsey ) , a detective interested in Hollywood and its many celebrities . Dewey works for Jennifer as security and her personal adviser , confidante and friend . He also coaches her to help her more effectively portray her character's role as Gale Weathers . Who better for the job than Gale's ex-lover ? Pictures of Sidney's mother begin to turn up at each murder site ; a perplexing fact which keeps Dewey's mouth tightly shut concerning Sidney's location . But when Sidney's security is unquestioningly breached , she reaches out to Dewey for that sense of connection and the security that only Dewey can give her . Gale and Dewey begin to puzzle out the mystery of Maurine Prescott's pictures , and slowly begin to put the pieces of the final puzzle together . If you liked Scream and Scream 2 , this movie is a must see . It answers all the questions and throws you for a final spin that was never eluded to in the first two . Wonderful , triumphant , wildly successful conclusion to this trilogy . I highly recommend all three installments of " Scream . " It gets a full from . . . the Fiend : .
559337	2626332	167261	10.0	A Masterpiece !	The epic saga continues , picking up right where the first left off , complete with hand sewn banners hung throughout the Golden Hall of Rohan , hand-fashioned armor and elves ! These works are perhaps the best I have ever seen . In the genre of fantasy , this series is seriously in danger of having replaced Star Wars as my all-time favorite movies . The direction was of the very best quality . The sets , designs , props and backdrops were realistic and without flaw . I highly recommend the extended edition , released in November 2003 . The scenes fully restored to their original glory before having some of the detail and story line left on the cutting room floor , this production is as " epic " as they come ; far larger than life . A task this formidable requires dedication , staying focused - both on the task at hand and in the creativity department . Neither were lacking here . I honestly found not one moment of wasted film , not one single element which should have been edited out or omitted , not one performance which was lacking in any way . While there WERE adaptations made to Tolkien's original literary work , I stand behind the creative decisions made , allowing that there were contractual obligations to be met , and fully and thoroughly enjoyed this darkling fantasy-filled adventure . This work , with its story set at the edge of the fall of Man , was dark and twisted , yet leaving us with hope for Mankind's future . I thought Jackson's work to be frightfully clever and wholly engrossing . This movie ( especially the extended version ) is absolutely wonderful ; a true credit to the whole industry .

559551	2626332	83791	10.0	Jim Henson's Masterpiece .	This has all the elements of brilliant horror / fantasy : an ancient evil , a damaged holy relic , a clan of wizards , a hero , and a prophecy . Additionally , it has elements so far above and beyond the " norm , " that I am simply amazed that this movie does not have a stronger following . These elements include a conceptual design by Brian Froud ( ! ) , a renowned fantasy artist , and the costume designer from " Labyrinth ; " the story , direction , and production of Jim Henson , himself ! ; a musical score by Trevor Jones , the composer who lovingly uplifted the beautiful movie , " Excalibur " so high above the other Arthurian productions ; and Muppet Show screenwriter David O'Dell . ( Yes , he also wrote the " Masters of the Universe " screenplay , but we will forgive him that transgression . ) The effects were done by our favorite Star Wars effects people at ILM , and while the characters were done by the puppeteers at Henson's Workshop , this is far from a Muppet Movie , believe Me . The story itself is creative , inspiring , and amazing , yet darkly sinister in its beauty in such a way as to completely hold you to it . If you share a love of fantasy , then you will surely love " The Dark Crystal . " I am wholly amazed with this production , even now , some 22 years after its release . The flora and fauna , the textures , the set designs , and costumes , the creature designs and distinction one from the other are all impeccably done , with full attention paid to the very last minor detail . The designs on the floors , walls , and trappings are meticulously designed , created , and manufactured , and this story was so wonderfully done that I am in absolute thrall with this movie , as if I have never seen it before ; indeed , this is My first viewing as an adult . This is a beautiful , darkling , compelling , and sinister tale , so professionally executed that it is , without question , the most creative and lovely fantasy I have ever seen . The narrative is compelling , and inspires a suspenseful beauty which begins with the opening scenes and continues throughout the Gelfling's quest for the crystal shard which is missing from the Dark Crystal , but once he has it , he realizes that no one has told him what he must do with it . Without his giving his all , making the hard choices and sacrifices , their lives will cease to exist . Will Jen the Gelfling save their world ? or will the evil Urskeks win dominion ? Watch this breathtakingly beautiful production , ride the spiral of Fate and Magick , and find out for yourself . IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS MOVIE , DO NOT READ PAST THIS POINT ! ! SPOILERS ABOUND ! ! But there is also another perspective on this film . . . The " evil " Urskeks and the " Wise Ones " are , of course , one and the same . This is highly symbolic of the world's leaders . We are all human beings , we all have the same emotions and we share the same capacity for caring as we do war . We all have wisdom and a " darker ' " side . This movie is a sub-promotion of the One-World Government ; the New World Order , mentioned in countless literary works across the globe . The Gelflings , who are creatures very reminiscent of elves , are those small people ; the common clay of the world's diverse societies - the survivors of the many man-made , world-wide holocausts which have been committed upon nearly every social group on the planet , at one time or another . The Dark Crystal itself is representative of many things : hope , greed , love . . . all those things which are the driving forces of those in power . The missing shard shows that when motivated by the wrong cause , part of the equation is missing , thereby leaving the person only partially filled , constantly needing more and more , never to be fully filled , nor their hunger for the power sated . This movie is also a caution against siding with one or the other of the forces , as they will one day come together in a kind of peace with which no one will be satisfied , due to their disliking and strong dissatisfaction with the other side . It shows us that homes can be confiscated by governments , land can be taken away , as can life , liberty , and all pursuit of happiness , at the whim of the governments . The most precious freedom we have , as humans , is the element of Free Will , which the Urskeks did remove from the Podlings by way of the darkest use of the Dark Crystal . Free Will can be removed , even if only in the mind . Brainwashing does occur , and it takes three times the amount of time and work to deprogram , than it does to set the brainwashing into place . This is a very deep , sociologically and psychologically thought-provoking endeavor , which I also found charming , brilliant , and lovely . . . on the surface . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .

559595	2626332	76759	10.0	One of the most successful movies of all time ( and I'm not talking about the Box Office take )	What made this the hugely successful triumph it was ? Was it casting , music , imagination , ingenuity , or luck ? I remember opening day at the theaters . I was old enough to remember every scene , every character , every nuance of this film ; having committed it to memory forever , as if I would never again be able to see this beloved , instantly loved masterpiece . I also remember that the HIT factor of this movie was so unexpected that you had to wait literal MONTHS to get the action figures promised on the cereal boxes . The pieces were still in the manufacturing process and we had to settle for coupons promising our toys in a few months . I wound up seeing this in the theaters a grand total of 36 times ; much to my mother's dismay . She loved the movie as I did , but felt I was obsessed . Today , thirty years later , sitting here writing this review , I realize how right she was . I'm still obsessed with this movie , and with the subsequent movies which followed . I wait in great anticipation for Episode 3 . I'm a fan , and I don't care what other people say about Episodes 1 & 2 . I don't even mind the " prequel " factor , as the situation at the time , dictated to Lucas which movies he would do first . See , I remember the studios saying to him that he had to choose from the three central climactic books , and trash the rest , or just trash the whole idea . He didn't exactly " sell out , " he did what he had to do to get his movie . . . his vision . . . out there for us to see and experience . I admired his decision then , and I admire it now . Episodes 1-3 are being filmed now , because Lucas had the clout , the money , and the patience to give us his vision . . . his complete vision and not just the three center books of a 9-book series . I realize that now , there are dozens of books , but at the time , there were nine . And while most of us were happy with Episodes 4-6 and would not have missed 1-3 and 7-9 , I personally am so very glad he has taken it upon himself to give us his full vision . I have enjoyed each and every installment with the same sense of awe and joy as I did this one . The casting was the first triumph for this cinematic milestone . Ford is a charismatic and magnetic personality and portrayed Han with a professionalism that you'd expect from more seasoned actors . Sir Alec Guiness is an absolute joy as Obi Wan . His casting was precise and excellent in that part . Carrie Fisher portrayed Leia in a way that , up until then , had never been experienced . Most " princess " types before her were whining , whimpering , little snots who were incapable of anything beyond tripping and twisting their ankle in times of peril , while Fisher portrayed her character as a bold , brazen , yet sophisticated and educated woman who was aware of her surroundings and capable of defending herself and her realm with the utmost authority . And Mark Hamil . He was perfectly cast as the whining little boy who wanted more , but was afraid to reach for it . He grows up quite well on film in these three installments , and endears himself to the audience so much the more for it . But a cast member who is almost always left out of these reviews is Peter Mayhew . Chewbacca . His character , as a supporting character to Han's , was exemplary . It's not easy portraying a walking carpet , yet holding the attention , admiration , and love of virtual millions . I am VERY happy about his being cast as Chewy in Episode 3 . Couldn't happen to a more deserving . . . or capable . . . fellow . Bravo ! And James Earl Jones's voice being used as the voice of Darth Vader , was pure genius . His commanding voice haunted the dreams of countless thousands of star-struck children for generations to come . I also have to say that this movie would not have had the charm it does had it not been for Anthony Daniels ' C3P0 . He is a gift and a joy . The musical score by John Williams featured in this masterpiece was one of the contributing factors . But honestly , this movie's success was such a total surprise to everyone , including Lucas , that nothing could prepare the world for the aftermath of having witnessed this bona fide legend , first hand . The story itself ; replete with sub-plot after sub-plot , rich in dialog and detail , was beyond anyone's greatest expectations . Everyone , including Lucas , expected this movie to fail . It is a timeless classic , which I will not repeat here . There are too many movie reviews giving full details of the plot , and I won't be redundant beyond what I have already said . However , that being said , there are a few points I would like to make concerning the symbolism of this endeavor . The Force is a metaphor for the psychic abilities with which we are all born . It was also a metaphor for hope and faith , dedication and commitment to the greater state of being . The Empire is said to have been a metaphor for the Germanic Nazi " storm troopers . " While the Rebellion is said to have been symbolic of ( what would later become ) the NATO forces who defeated them . And then there are the effects . The effects were , in 1977 , so awesome ; so creative ; so ahead of their time , as to ensure this movie's vast success for the next forty years . George Lucas enjoys an almost god-like status among sci-fi / fantasy fans worldwide . This movie does not rate a rating . Usually , when I say that , it is because the movie is so bad , or disappointing that I don't have the heart to rate it . But in this case , it far surpasses any rating I could give it .

In spite of what were cheap sets , uncomfortable uniforms , ridiculously low budgets , and backdrops which were used and reused so often that the audience became intimately familiar with them , the performances were brilliant television fare , the characters were cleverly and lovingly developed , and the stories were socially aware , cutting edge content . There has never been another show like Star Trek . They have tried , and some have come close , but nothing has ever replaced Star Trek in my heart . Star Trek gave us everything . In that one , low budget television show , we got a hero , a sraight-shooting friend , a lady's role model . We learned honesty , integrity , intelligence , and friendship . No other show has ever done that for an entire generation , like Star Trek has . It rates a solid from . . . the Fiend : .
559040	2626332	397501	10.0	Beautiful .	The problem with the 1985 version of this movie is simple ; Indiana Jones was so closely modeled after Alan Quartermain ( or at least is an Alan Quartermain TYPE of character ) , that the ' 85 director made the mistake of plundering the IJ movies for dialog and story far too deeply . What you got as a finished product was a jumbled mess of the name Alan Quartermain , in an uneven hodge podge of a cheaply imitated IJ saga ( with a touch of Austin Powers-esquire cheese here and there ) . It was labeled by many critics to have been a " great parody , " or " unintentional comedy . " Unintentional is the word . This movie was never intended to be humorous ; witty , yes , but not humorous . Unfortunately , it's witless rather than witty . With this new M4TV mini-series , you get much more story , character development of your lead , solid portrayals , and a fine , even , entertaining blend . This story is a bit long ; much longer than its predecessors , but deservedly so as this version carries a real storyline and not just action and Eye Candy . While it features both action and Eye Candy , it also corrects the mistake made in the 1985 version by forgetting IJ all together and going back to the source materials for AQ , making for a fine , well - thought - out plot , and some nice complementing sub-plots . Now this attempt is not the all out action-extravaganza that is Indiana Jones . Nor is it a poor attempt to be so . This vehicle is plot and character driven and is a beautiful rendition of the AQ / KSM saga . Filmed on location in South Africa , the audience is granted beautiful ( if desolate ) vistas , SA aboriginal cultures , and some nice wildlife footage to blend smoothly with the performances and storyline here . Steve Boyum totally surprised me with this one , as I have never been one to subscribe to his vision . In fact , I have disliked most of his work as a director , until this attempt . I hope this is more a new vein of talent and less the fluke that it seems to be . This version rates a on the " TV " scale from . . . the Fiend : .
559565	2626332	118929	10.0	Wonderfully " dark " sci-fi / horror .	While this was based on Metropolis , this attempt is - much - more entertaining . This is also probably Jennifer Connely's best attempts to date ( this is being written after the Hulk and House of Sand and Fog , by the way ) , and William Hurt's most interesting role . This story is a beautiful , mysterious , darkling tale of deceit , intrigue , and murder . Even after the secrets are discovered , the whole story is not told until the very end . This movie is an ultimate ride on the mind twister train . Just sit back , and remember to employ your thinking cap as you enjoy the ride . I will not spoil this movie , as many others have . I will let my rating of this movie speak for itself . If you are a fan of dark tales , science-fiction , or psychological horror / thrillers , this is a definite must-see . It highlights stellar performances by Keifer Sutherland , William Hurt , Jennifer Connely , and Rufus Sewell ( Lord Adamar from A Knight's Tale ) . I highly recommend the Platinum Series Collection edition which includes the Widescreen and Fullscreen versions , commentaries by film critic Roger Ebert , another by the Director , writers , DoP and production designer , the Find Shell Beach interactive Game , Cast and crew biographies , filmographies and Star Highlights , Comparisons to Fritz Lang's Metropolis , Theatrical Trailer , Set Designs and fully animated menus . I enjoy this version of the DVD immensely . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
558706	2626332	77413	10.0	One of the best !	Peter Ustinov portrays Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot , traveling on board a steamer ship down the Nile on an interrupted vacation via the murder of a socialite who has offended the entire world it seems , and has been deemed a " leach on the edges of society , " to quote one of the characters in the movie . Assisted by David Niven , he must sleuth out the instigator of this interruption before all the ship's passengers end up dead . One by one , they are being knocked off to cover the evidences of the original murder . Fine performances by all involved , but hats off to Mia Farrow ! Possibly the most brilliant performance of her career . Stunning . Absolutely stunning . An all-star cast delivers an all-star performance in this top row production . The scenes were deliberate and well planned , the scripting was marvelous , the dialog was funny where it should be and intense where intended , the costuming was marvelously period , and the direction was without peer . But it was the scenery , the settings , the sets and the props that made me love this film . Set in Egypt of the 70's , you can see the Sphinx before it was blasted by 30 more years of sand , bombs and fighting . You get to climb to the top of the pyramid of Khufu in Giza , see the Karnak Temple in Luxor , the Dendara Temple is featured in the background shots of several scenes . You are shown parts of the Philae Temple ( temple of Isis ) , and the Abu Simbel near Aswan ( built by Ramses the Great to celebrate his victories and his beloved wife , Nefetari . Lovely images of the Nile , its people and the surrounding areas . Ustinov being one of my favorite Poirot's over the years , I rank this movie at least equal with the Murder On The Orient Express , though I think more money and time were wrongly dedicated to MotOE . Had Ustinov portrayed Poirot in MotOE , it would have been my favorite . There isn't a moment of wasted film in this movie . Every scene gives you some insight into these well-developed characters . Watch for the scene where Bette Davis is " mooned " by the local children ! The scene towards the very beginning of the movie , between Maggie Smith and her " Lady , " is hilarious . Absolutely side stitching , if you can appreciate the dry , British sense of humor . Top row movie , with top row casting , direction , screenplay and SCENERY . Take an Egyptian vacation in your living room . This masterpiece gets a solid ( a rarity ) from . . . the Fiend .
559585	2626332	387616	10.0	Superior film documentary	Every bit as informative and comprehensive as " The Beast Within : The Making of Alien . " As does the first , this continuation of the Making Of history of the Alien Quadrilogy takes you from conception to post production and marketing . This work is extremely well put together , completely inclusive , and very entertaining for fans of this venue . I especially enjoyed pre-production featurette , " Preparing for Battle , " and the production featurettes in particular . They show you the weapons designs , and detail every aspect of that portion of the prop elements involved . Every chapter of this documentary is inclusively in ? depth . Each portion carrying itself as a stand alone featurette , as if there are no more chapters , so they had best tell you all they know . I was quite impressed with every aspect of this documentary work . It is just amazing to me that every part , from the information included to the quality of the film upon which it is presented was just perfect . Every little piece ; every little detail . This is a fan-boy's dream come true . from . . . the Fiend : .
