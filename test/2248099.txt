422002	2248099	369226	1.0	Wow , it really is as bad as they say . . .	Having seen this and hated it is made even worse by the fact that it's all my fault . When most people hear comments about a film that are as bad as what's been said about Alone in the Dark , they'll avoid at all costs ; but for me , the bad comments really made me want to see it , just to see if it is really is as bad as they say - and surprise , surprise , it's just as bad ; if not worse . There are a number of things that can make a movie be the opposite of good , and Alone in the Dark manages to lampoon a surprising amount of them . First of all , this film is boring in a way not often seen outside of films that have the words ' Blair ' , ' Project ' and ' Witch ' in the title . It's based on a video game ( that I've never played , by the way ) , so you'd expect there to be lots of flashy and exciting scenes ; but there isn't . There are scenes that should be exciting , but it's all so downbeat that it's hard to care . Despite looking good , the film also suffers from really poor production elements , including really bad acting , a terrible script and lethargic direction , courtesy of everyone least favourite modern horror director ; the lamentable Uwe Boll . Actually ( and thankfully ) , this is the first film I've seen from Boll , and I'm not finding the idea of the rest being rubbish hard to handle . House of the Dead was lambasted upon release , so you'd expect movie producers to blacklist the director ; but instead , they gave him this film , which was also lambasted upon release . So what do they do ? They give him Bloodrayne , that gets lambasted and now I've noticed that his upcoming projects include adaptations of Postal and Fear Effect ! What's going on here ? ! I'm not a movie director , and other than what I've picked up through watching other people's films , I don't know anything about movie-making ; but I'd really like to think that even I could make a better movie than this one ( I'm available to make a video game movie , if any of Boll's producers are listening ) . This brings me to the acting . I actually rather like Christian Slater , so I really hope that he was well paid for appearing in this trash , because seeing him try to convince the audience that he's all action hero is really painful . No point in mentioning the rest of the cast . . . or anything else about this film . I wasted an hour and half on it , and it took me about ten minutes writing this . That's enough time down the drain , thanks .
421750	2248099	276626	2.0	Went the Wrong Way on ripping off The Last House on the Left	Usually , I love this sort of film . . . but Wrong Way just doesn't cut it . The influence from Wes Craven's classic The Last House on the Left is clear and obvious throughout , but the film doesn't do anything new with it and overall is really rather boring . The Last House on the Left inspired a number of rape and revenge films ; the majority of which hailed from Italy and are rather good if you're into this sort of stuff . That's what makes Wrong Way all the more disappointing ; it's not a bad thing to rip off Craven's film , but when all you've got is a series of sex scenes , you know that it hasn't been done well . The plot is virtually non-existent , and simply focuses on a couple of girls that end up being raped and abused by a few bored hippies . The film is notorious for its rape scenes that go on seemingly forever , but it gets old fast . I have no problem with sex in movies , and in fact actively seek out this sort of dirty , grisly film . . . but there really is no reason to bother seeking out Wrong Way . It's currently unavailable in Britain , and that certainly isn't a bad thing .
422251	2248099	73794	3.0	Boring vampire film	Peter Cushing in a vampire movie . Sound good ? Yes I thought so too . . . until I saw Tender Dracula . This is a French film and comes across as something like an arty Hammer Horror flick . The plot focuses on two writers . They go on a trip with their girlfriends ( who both look like men in drag ) and end up at the castle of an aging actor . He is famous for portraying vampires on screen ; but as the night progresses , the group begins to wonder if the man is really acting when he is on screen . The film basically consists of eighty five minutes of boring dialogue and as you can probably imagine ; it gets boring quickly . The copy I saw was of really poor quality ; but in spite of that it's clear that the film doesn't utilise any particularly interesting locations which helps to make it more of a dull experience . The title , ' Tender Dracula ' lead me to believe that it might be some sort of soft-core porn outing , but there's no sex or nudity in the film and the title is quite inappropriate . I'd hesitate even to call this a horror film really since there's no actual horror in it . Tender Dracula is a ' lost ' film , and really that is for good reason and I doubt it will be resurfacing any time soon !
423296	2248099	112854	3.0	The radio was only playing rubbish on the set of this stinker	You know those really stupid ideas you get sometimes when you wake up in the middle of the night ? Well , you can imagine the scene : the man who would later have the idea for Destiny Turns on the Radio is asleep in his bed . He wakes up in a cold sweat one night ; " A magic swimming pool ! " , he exclaims , " . . and a cool guy can come out , and this guy be the illusive one , who holds it all together " , he's really sweating now , " and we'll get Quentin Tarantino to play him ! " . After seeing the movie , it's safe to say that it was a extremely stupid idea . As mentioned , Quentin Tarantino plays a man that comes out a swimming pool . Yes , you heard me right ; in an absolutely ridiculous sequence , Tarantino actually rises from an electricity-ridden swimming pool . The only thing more ridiculous than that sequence in this movie is Quentin Tarantino's actual performance . Tarantino has proved , time and time again , that acting isn't his forte , but he puts it beyond a shadow of a doubt here . He tries to look cool with his swagger and slow moving voice , but he actually just looks pathetic . One good thing is that he doesn't get a lot of screen time ; but the mere fact that he's in it loses the movie some of it's credibility , and this is a movie that doesn't exactly have credibility to burn . It's a shame that this movie is so terrible really , as it does have quite a good cast . Dylan McDermott , one of stars of my guiltiest pleasure , 1999's rom-com ; Three to Tango takes the lead role , with Nancy Travis ( So I Married an Axe Murderer ) as his girlfriend , James LeGros as his friend and David Cross , who I actually like a lot , is in the movie as an agent of some sort . The stupid plot isn't helped at all by a lacklustre script . Modern crime movies have become known for snappy dialogue and offbeat characters , and this movie has both ; albeit both badly done . The dialogue has some truly ridiculous lines and most of the time they are delivered badly , too . This is most probably due to the fact that most of the cast were probably cursing their agents while making this film , and have probably spent the last ten years trying to forget that Destiny ever turned on the radio . As you , the viewer , will no doubt do ; but it certainly won't take ten years . My advice ? Watch something else .
421897	2248099	83585	3.0	Dull and boring Giallo from former master Sergio Martino	The Scorpion with Two Tails has all the makings of a great Giallo . Aside from the intriguing title , it's also directed by Sergio Martino ; the same man who made some of the best Giallo's of the seventies with films such as The Strange Vice of Mrs Wardh , it's written by Ernesto Gastaldi ; whose name will mean a lot to every Giallo fan worth their salt as he has written many of the best films that the genre has to offer , and on top of that - we've even got a performance from cult actor John Saxon . However , Martino clearly didn't have his penchant for directing by 1982 , Gastaldi was having an off day and John Saxon's character lasts all of about two minutes ! Like the earlier Giallo , The Dead Are Alive , this film focuses on the ancient ' Etruscan ' civilisation . Joan Barnard , the wife of Arthur Barnard ; a famous archaeologist is having problems . She's suffering from nightmares that focus around ancient tombs . Her woes increase when her husband calls from Italy and ends up getting his neck snapped mid-phone call ! She then travels to Italy to investigate . This film was apparently cut down from a television series , and I can only assume that they left the worst parts in ! There's barely any excitement to speak of whatsoever , and this ensures that the film is very hard to care about . Add in some extremely unenthusiastic performances ( unenthusiastic even by Italian horror standards ! ) and some silly fantasy crap and what we've ended up with here is one of the worst Giallo's ever made ! It's a real shame too as this film blends in a few different styles and if Martino could have just pulled it all together better , this could definitely have sat alongside his more esteemed film credits . One of the few saving graces in this film is the music ; but once you recognise it from The Beyond , the credibility soon dries up ! At least the film manages to limp through with a decent finale ; though once you've sat through the first eighty five minutes of the film , it could be the best ending of all time and most people would be unlikely to care . Overall , this is absolutely nothing to recommend this film for and I recommend that everyone skips it !
423886	2248099	95484	3.0	Extremely lame ghost story - nothing worth seeing here !	I went into this film expecting a horror film , as that's what my TV guide touted it as - but was disappointed ( to say the least ! ) when it turned out that this film is actually a childish fantasy , in the vein of that other load of rubbish ; Paperhouse ( also from 1988 ) . It took about twenty minutes for me to realise that I was in the wrong movie , but by then it was too late , as I hate making it half way through a film . I was turned off instantly by ' happy ' tone of the film , and further turned off by the irritating soundtrack ; which gives away the fact that the film is going to end sentimentally . The fact that it stars that irritating kid from Witness was the final straw , and I was only ever going to hate this film ( unless something really great happened in the last 90 minutes , of course . . . ) . The plot follows a kid who finds himself locked in the cloakroom on Halloween night . Cloakrooms aren't the best places to spend Halloween ; and this one in particular isn't , as our ' hero ' witnesses the death of a girl from years before . Naturally , he resolves to solve the mystery . . . blah blah blah . Aside from featuring an annoying kid , bad music and a ' fun ' tone ; Lady in White is also really , really boring . I was really struggling not to hit the fast forward button before long , and tears of boredom were cascading down my face by the time the final credits ( finally ! ) rolled . This is one of those films that you really have to see when you're a kid to appreciate it ; and even then , you shouldn't really appreciate it . It's like E . T . , in that it's a film where the only good point once you reach adulthood is a sense of nostalgia . Don't get me wrong ; I'm no fan of E . T . , but at least Spielberg's film gives the audience reason to like it ; you will find no such thing here . I've never been a big fan of ghost stories anyway , and it's films like this that are to blame for that . Ghosts simply don't make for entertaining horror ; especially not when they're the goody-goody ones seen here . It's really hard to find them frightening , too , as the leads are impossible to care about . On the whole , I'd rather throw a hammer at my TV set than watch this rubbish again ; and if your TV guide leads you to believe it's worth watching - take my word for it , it's not .
422646	2248099	61014	3.0	Bava and Price combine to make a double career worst !	Mario Bava is one of my all time favourite directors , and Vincent Price is one of my all time favourite actors ; so despite the fact that I didn't like Dr Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine at all , I still felt almost as if catching this needless sequel was a duty I had to fulfil . Before making this film , Bava had already directed a number of classics including Black Sabbath , Black Sunday and The Whip and The Body , while Vincent Price had completed his work on Roger Corman's Poe Anthology along with several other classic films . I can only assume , therefore , that the pair had decided to take a break from making good films as this is a million miles away from the best that the two men can do ! Well , either that or they both just wanted to spend some time with scantily clad ladies , and I can't really blame them if that was the case ! Anyway , the plot has something to do with dubious ' assassin ' Dr Goldfoot building an army of robot bombs that look like pretty girls ( will be familiar to Austin Powers fans ! ) , and he uses them to eliminate some of Nato's world leaders . . . or something . Mario Bava's best work was in the horror genre and as such a lot of what I like about his directorial style is relative to the genre ; but he has proved on many occasions that he's capable of delivering good films in other genres , but you'd be forgiven for thinking otherwise based on this film ! There is a lot of nonsense happening in the movie and this undoubtedly distracts from the directing ; but it's clear that Bava wasn't really trying . What a shame that this is the only film he and the great Vincent Price made together ! The film was obviously intended to be funny ; but all the humour if of the very goofy variety and I honestly did not laugh even once during the film . At a struggle , I could only really think of two good things to say about this film ; one is that Vincent Price is entertaining ( although he could read out a recipe book and it would be entertaining ) and the other is that some of the girls featured are nice to look at . The first Dr Goldfoot film was terrible , and this one is worse . They couldn't even think of a catchy jingle to go over the title sequence ! I wouldn't recommend this movie to even hardcore Bava and Price fans . . .
423846	2248099	61005	3.0	No good Gothic horror	On the face of it , this film would seem to have a lot going for it . First up we've got a role for the great Barbara Steele , and second of all the director is Michael Reeves ; the same man behind the horror classic Witchfinder General . However , The She-Beast can only be described as a colossal failure . Naturally , this movie is pure cheese ; but it's not enjoyable cheese as the film isn't merely crap - it's painfully crap . The story is sadly boring , the special effects are terrible ; the acting is rubbish , the direction is rubbish and there is very little in the way of redeeming elements . Not even Barbara Steele can save this film , as she only appears for a few minutes and Michael Reeves doesn't make the best use of her during this time . Interestingly , Reeves used a big horror star in every one of his four films ; Witchfinder General has Vincent Price , The Sorcerers featured Boris Karloff and Castle of the Living Dead has Christopher Lee ; but unfortunately , the female horror icon has been sold short as The She-Beast is absolute garbage , and I seriously see no good reason to waste your time with it . Not recommended .
423312	2248099	396938	3.0	Witchcraft has never been so boring	Every now and then , I see a film advertised in the TV guide that I'll see for no other reason than the title sounds interesting . Believe it or not , I thought that ' Witches of the Caribbean ' sounded interesting . I'm a fan of witch related films , as they often make for good horror and the Caribbean setting was leading me to believe that this might offer something in the way of originality . Any hopes I had for the movie were quickly dashed , however , when I found out that the film was directed by David DeCoteau ; a man that has made a whole host of straight-to-video rubbish , including the awesomely bad ' Wolves of Wall Street ' . Really , though , all I wanted from this film was some decent magic done by some hot Goth girls in a nice setting . It's safe to say , however , that I didn't even get that . What I did get is a severely under imaginative movie with a cast that is about as impressive as the film's setting - which looks more like a UK holiday resort on a bad day than the Caribbean . The plot stinks of " cant be bothered " and follows the dull and overly familiar idea of a witch being burnt at the stake , only to be reincarnated centuries later . Not that there's a big problem with this sort of plot ; several films , such as Mario Bava's Black Sunday and Roger Corman's The Haunted Palace have took that theme and made it work ; but both of those movies had something about them , whereas this one clearly does not . The cast of actors doesn't help the film in it's bid to be successful , as none of them stand out enough to make any kind of lasting impression . The only impression made on any level is just that the actors are irritating ; the lead witch , Nicole Marie Monica , being the foremost irritating member of the cast . The special effects are just as bad as the rest of the film , and once again feel like whoever was in charge had something more important on their mind . The awful ending tops off what is a bad movie on the whole and I can tell that if you ever see this film in your TV guide and think it might be worth a watch . . . think again .
422570	2248099	91707	3.0	Seeing this film wouldn't be one of my three wishes	I was worried that this film might be just an eighties version of the crappy nineties horror ' Wishmaster ' , but as it happens ; it would have been a better film if it were . The problem with this film , ironically considering it's a trashy eighties horror film , is simply that it's boring . It starts out slow , and even when the rudimentary bunch of dumb teens start to get picked off , the film never really picks up . It's a shame really as the idea of an evil genie wreaking havoc is actually quite a good one , but this film just doesn't do it justice . The plot focuses on a magic lamp which is stolen from an old woman's house . The lamp ends up in a museum when the thieves are killed . When the museum curator's daughter is possessed , she invites a bunch of friends for fun and games in the museum basement , and everyone ends up coming a cropper . I can live with bad acting and nauseating dialogue , even crappy special effects . . . but the story needs to be good to compensate , and this film is far too simple . The genie itself looks about as scary as your average lump of plasticine , and while the film features a few moments of gory horror ; overall , it's not good enough . The Lamp certainly doesn't come recommended .
423548	2248099	64369	3.0	As amateurish as they come , a shocking waste of film stock !	I saw this film purely based on the fact that it was on the DPP Video Nasty list , and while I'm glad I saw it because it's now ' another Video Nasty down ' - on its own merits , Andy Milligan's film really isn't worth bothering with . There are , of course , far worse films on the infamous list ; but that doesn't make the pain of viewing this one any easier . The film was obviously shot on an extremely low budget , and that has translated into the script ; as Blood Rites works on an idea often seen in horror cinema , and doesn't do anything new with it . Basically , the plot centres on three couples who find themselves at a house awaiting the results of a will . It's not long before they start getting picked off . . . blah blah blah . For most of the film , nothing happens ; and then when we finally get down to the scenes that justify the movie being banned , they're so amateurish and silly that they're impossible to take seriously on any level . It's a very good thing that this movie doesn't have a very long running time as otherwise it could have been used as a particularly nasty method of torture . It all boils down to a fittingly tedious ending , which also succeeds in being a non-event of epic proportions . Apparently , this movie is still banned here in the UK ; but somehow I doubt it's because of its shock value . Basically , Blood Rites isn't worth seeing and I personally can see no reason to recommend it . Unless , of course , you've made it your business to see everything on the Video Nasty list . . .
423552	2248099	77912	4.0	Blood Feast's seventies update	Blood Feast will always have cult value for the fact that it was directed by Herschell Gordon Lewis , and for the fact that it is the oldest film to be featured on the DPP Video Nasty list . Whether or not it needed a seventies update , however , is up for debate ; but it got one , so I guess someone thought it did . Mardi Gras Massacre puts more focus on nudity than HG's classic did , and the gore is a lot more realistic ; but despite the script which contains some real inept lines of dialogue , Jack Weis ' film just doesn't have the camp class of the earlier schlock-fest , and overall the film just isn't as good . The plot once again follows a deranged psycho who is going round killing various women in order to sacrifice them to some god or other . We follow the psychopath as he goes about his macabre business , and also a rather ineffective police investigation into the whole affair . The acting and dialogue are continually ridiculous . . . perhaps not quite to HG Lewis ' standards , but certainly below the level of most B-movie pictures . Many films on the DPP list didn't deserve to be there ; and there's nothing in this film that warranted it's banning either . The gore is fairly plentiful and is often fused with ' scenes of a sexual nature ' , but it's nothing that the average adult couldn't endure . The music is note for being particularly stupid , and also for featuring far too often . The music , like a lot of the scenes in the movie , seems a lot like filler . Blood Feast didn't have a lot of plot to go on either , but at least it didn't stretch its running time out to over ninety minutes . Mardi Gras Massacre could easily have been cut down by twenty minutes without losing a thing . There are certainly a few good scenes in this film ; the opening murder being a highlight , but even so ; it has to be said that Mardi Gras Massacre is severely lacking . There is a lot of rubbish on the Video Nasty list ; but despite that , if I were to line them all up in terms of quality - this would be nearer to the bottom . Not particularly recommended .
423161	2248099	294594	4.0	Dull , uninspired , unoriginal , dreary , messy , tedious little mystery flick	What we have here is another religion-themed mystery horror movie that is neither as successful as the films it's copying nor as inspired as it thinks it is . This film was released around four years ago , but I suspect that it has ran into some distribution problems as the film still doesn't have a wide release . This is no loss to anyone . The film ponders along a plot line of mystery mixed with horror elements , or rather tries to ; it actually comes out like a standard drama where someone is seeing ' visions ' . The plot is messy throughout , and even though it's not heavy going - getting confused is easy as several plot points just sort of spring up without much explanation . The plot follows a girl who gets hit by a car . After suffering only minor wounds , and amnesia , the woman who hit her takes the girl back to her place ; where she is given the job of nanny for the two children , despite the fact that not even the girl herself really knows who she is . This is lumped in with a religion themed plot about a ' gathering ' of people who watched Christ die on the cross . The main selling point of The Gathering is , of course , the fact that it stars Christina Ricci . Ricci tries to look enthusiastic about her role , but her performance only ever comes across as being forced ; and you don't get the idea that she was particularly fascinated by this film . I can't blame her . Personally , I think she should get a better agent , as she's not been getting the good roles in recent years . A saving grace for the film , for me anyway , is the fact that it's set in Britain and benefits from a distinctly Brit style . Many British films don't make proper use of the location , but at least this one mostly does . The horror is incredibly ineffective , with most of it stemming from the dull central character seeing things idea . I'd even go as far as to say that this isn't really a horror film , as the major focus is always on the plight of the lead character . But then again , it doesn't work as a drama either - the plot is too uninteresting , and it's clear that director Brian Gilbert didn't really know what he wanted his film to be . On the whole , The Gathering is a messy , aimless and dull ' mystery ' film that isn't worth seeing . Avoid , is my advice .
422948	2248099	87555	4.0	Kill an hour by doing something else !	Since this film is a thriller directed by someone with an Italian sounding name , I was expecting something like an American version of Italy's finest export - the Giallo . The film certainly has elements that resemble the Giallo , but it constantly falls down as everything in the film is just so DULL . The plot opens with the discovery of a dead body making its way down the Hudson River . We than follow the investigation into the crimes , which is a joint venture between a police detective and a TV talk show host . The story also gets an extra element of mystery through Virna Nightbourne ; a clairvoyant who draws the crimes before they happen . Obviously the idea of someone being able to draw crimes before they happen is more than a little bit preposterous , but to be honest I could live with that if the resulting film was entertaining . However , the film is not entertaining ; we've got a couple of decent murder scenes , and that really is the only point of interest . The way that the film plays out is far too serious given the silliness of it , and by the time it ended I was thoroughly bored ! Not recommended .
422290	2248099	74473	4.0	Porn nonsense from one of the sleaze masters	Ah , Italy . Back in the seventies ; if a certain type of film was successful , those crazy Italians would make their own version of it . The French Emmanuelle series must have been pretty popular , as it didn't take them long to knock a ' m ' out of the title and create their own version . This is my first Emanuelle film ( Italian or otherwise ) , and I'm not in a rush to see any more . If I had to describe this film in one word , I would use the word ' hollow ' . There is absolutely no substance , and no point , to Emanuelle in America ; not even a backhanded comment on ' sex in the media ' or something , and all the film really is , is a series of sex scenes dumped in between sections of irrelevance , which appear to be some attempt at forming a plot . Laura Gemser takes the lead role , as a woman who isn't too fussy when it comes to having sex . Tall , short ; fat , thin ; man , woman ; smoker , non-smoker - ten fingers or twelve - you'd have a chance with this woman . The first scene sets the right tone for the rest of the movie nicely ; we see a man about to kill Emanuelle in her own car . This sequence is silly , badly scripted , completely irrelevant and nothing comes of it - just like the rest of the movie . The film plays to its strengths , however ; and the fact that Laura Gemser stars in pretty much every scene shows this . I don't profess to be big fan myself , but I understand she has quite a cult following ; which has no doubt won this flick most of its fans . As you'd expect , sex sequences are in abundance ; which is sure to please most viewers as that'll be what most people are tuning in for . I , however , can't say I'm a massive fan of porn films . The sex here is never overly erotic anyway , and it's really easy to get bored as the plot is so non-existent . Joe D'Amato's name is synonymous with sleaze , and this film shows that nicely . Considering the type of film this is ( and the country it was made in ) , the production values here are surprisingly good ! The film is well photographed , while the locations are generally fairly lavish and colourful . The music fits nicely , and the way in which certain sex scenes take place - such as the one in front of an orchestra - show some imagination on the director's part . I can't say I enjoyed this film too much ; it has its moments , but one hundred minutes is too long for this sort of thing , and I reckon that unless you're a fan of films where people walk round talking nonsense while they're not screwing each other ; this one is best forgotten .
421894	2248099	477347	4.0	Somewhat amusing , but mostly a letdown .	I figured this film might be amusing after seeing the trailer , and while it has it's moments , overall I'd have to say that Night at the Museum reminded me far too much of that other poor kids film about inanimate objects coming to life , The Indian in the Cupboard . The film gets off to a good start , as we are introduced to Ben Stiller's ' loser ' character as he tries to get a job to provide stability for his son . It's obvious that it's just an excuse to get Stiller into the museum where everything comes alive , but he's a likable actor and the opening of the film does well at getting the audience into the film . However , once we finally get to the museum coming to life , it starts to become obvious what this movie is going to turn into . While it's somewhat amusing to see a dinosaur skeleton acting like a dog and a talking Easter Island head , I was let down by the way the film is so clearly made for children that I felt like I was being patronised while watching it , which makes the film much less fun . One of the major strongpoint's of this film is the cast . Ben Stiller is likable , as usual , in the lead role and he gets good back up from a range of stars . The trio of Dick Van Dyke , Mickey Rooney and Bill Cobbs provide a few laughs , while the film is fleshed out by comedians such as Robin Williams , Owen Wilson and Steve Coogan as museum exhibits . Ricky Gervais also makes an appearance ( as a favour to Stiller for appearing in Extras ) , but doesn't look comfortable in his role at all . To its credit , at least the film is never boring and the CGI is actually quite convincing too , which isn't always the case . The film really isn't all that funny , though , and a lot of the jokes just fall flat . There's also far too much sentiment for my liking and the film just ends up being irritating most of the time . It all boils down to a largely predictable conclusion that is unlikely to do anything for most viewers . The film does have its good points ; it's entertaining and kids will probably like it , but Night at the Museum is not very well put together and most older film viewers won't get much out of it .
422753	2248099	74845	4.0	Bad , even for a Jaws rip-off !	This film starts off by thanking the underwater directorial team for risking their lives for the making of it . I sincerely hope that this is just some sort of ploy and not actually the case , as Mako : The Jaws of Death is definitely not a film that anyone should even consider risking their life over . In 1975 , Steven Spielberg released what is probably the great shark movie of all time with Jaws , but he really has a lot to answer for as that film inspired a whole host of awful ( mostly Italian ) rip-offs . I've only seen a handful of Jaws rip-offs , but even among the few that I've seen ? Mako : The Jaws of Death surely ranks right down near the bottom , and that's actually a shame because it has a fairly decent plot idea going for it . Basically , we focus on a man with a bond for sharks . He keeps a few as ' friends ' but attracts interest from local entities - including a scientist and a nightclub . He ends up loaning out some of his sharks , but is not impressed with their treatment and so decides to take his revenge . . . The film does manage a true seventies exploitation style and while the film obviously shot on a very low budget , it still manages to be fairly good in that respect . The problem really is with the way that the plot is developed as it doesn't fulfil its potential and none of the characters are interesting enough to really care about , and that unfortunately includes the lead who really should have been a lot better considering his strange interest in sharks . There are a couple of familiar faces in the cast list - most notably Richard Jaeckel and Harold Sakata , who is credited in this film as Harold " Oddjob " Sakata . Unfortunately ( saying that a lot in this review . . . ) , considering that the film is about sharks , sharks actually don't feature all that often and when they do it's a bit of a let-down . The film also lacks a lot of humour , and while it's clear that the filmmakers were not making a serious horror film to the audience ; apparently they themselves were oblivious that fact ! Overall , Mako : The Jaws of Death is a silly and tepid film and should not really be viewed by anyone !
423103	2248099	300222	4.0	Misty Mundae , Darian Caine and a man wrapped in bog roll , in someone's garage	I can't say I'm all that experienced in misty Mundae flicks having seen only a handful , but it's obvious that this was made on a shoestring , and while it might have been respectable that the filmmakers were able to make a Tomb Raider rip-off inside a garage , it isn't because it's completely obvious that this is what they were doing . The film only runs for forty five minutes , and this is definitely a good thing as there isn't nearly enough plot here to stretch it out for any longer . It has something to do with an evil Nazi scientist ( who looks about as evil as a porn star playing a Nazi scientist ever could ) , a mummy , which is clearly a man wrapped up in toilet roll and Misty - this film's version of Tomb Raider , who keeps her top on for much less time than Angelina Jolie did in the big budget version . I have to say that even in spite of its shortcomings , this film could have been better . It's got Misty Mundae for a start , and even better than that if you ask me is the fact that it also stars the even hotter Darian Caine . The pair gets to engage in all the lesbian sex that you would expect from a Seduction Cinema film and this is at the expense of the nonexistent plot , although that isn't really a bad thing . Obviously , this is a rubbish film - but the fact that it's short is to its credit , and if you're after a bit of lesbian sex , you could do worse .
422234	2248099	118643	5.0	Walken is back ! . . . in a rather mundane sequel	The first Prophecy wasn't a bad film , but whether or not it deserved a sequel is debatable . So far , it has actually received four sequels - but this is the only one that I've seen . Overall , this film isn't good enough to warrant me bothering with any more follow-ups , but it provides a decent enough hour and twenty minutes of entertainment . Just like the original , this film fuses action with themes of biblical horror and once again follows the fortunes of the diabolical angel Gabriel during another plot to destroy the human race . Naturally , it's all very convoluted and silly ; doesn't make much sense and features several elements that are obviously thrown in to sell the film ; but hey , you can't expect anything else from a film like this . The film revolves around a child conceived by Gabriel's adversary , Danyael and a normal woman . Gabriel has taken it upon himself to get rid of this baby , which was prophesised by a monk ; and after his army of angels have been exterminated , he decides to employ the services of a suicidal girl named ' Izzy ' . . . The main reason I saw this film was , of course , because of the presence of its lead star ; Christopher Walken . Walken's role isn't very meaty , but he makes the best of it with a charged performance that steals every scene he's in . The original film benefited from a great star-studded cast to support Walken ; whereas this film doesn't . That being said , it does feature some decent actors . Jennifer Beals is good in support along with Russell Wong , while future star Brittany Murphy stands out as the suicide obsessed teen and cult horror fans will recognise Re-Animator's Bruce Abbott in a small role . The film features a plethora of action scenes , which are mostly well done ; but after a while it all gets rather dry as the plot isn't too interesting and it all seems to drone on . The film doesn't really fit much with any actual bible stories ; which is something of a disappointment as that was one of the best things about the original movie . Overall , Prophecy II is worth seeing for fans of the original , although it's not a particularly good movie .
423209	2248099	171089	5.0	Women's prisons in Brazil are sleazier than most !	Well I've got to say that I do enjoy a good slice of sleaze ; but I also like there to be some sort of narrative to keep my interest , and this film lacks that ; which leaves it feeling rather shallow and pointless . As the title suggests , Bare Behind Bars is another one of those ' women in prison ' films , and the fact that it hails from Brazil means that you can certainly count on gratuitous sex and nudity , which this film features in droves . There's all sorts of stuff going on , from lesbian sex to the use of dildo's and other implements , and everyone in the prison gets involved ; from the prisoners to the guards and everyone in-between . The only slight hint of plot revolves around a prison break , which happens towards the end . There's a fair amount of violence to go with the sex and general sleaze , which includes certain male body parts being removed and , on one occasion , being fed to the family dog ! However , while this film has everything you could want in terms of sleaze ; the lack of any plot at all really does harm it . Obviously this is not a genre that is well known for great stories , but this film is shallow even by genre standards ; and while I'm not an expert on sleazy women in prison flicks - Jess Franco has certainly done better .
423913	2248099	70222	5.0	Could have bee ( n ) better	Well , I wasn't expecting anything more than a ' fun B-movie thriller ' from Invasion of the Bee Girls , and I didn't get anything more . I can certainly think of more fun ways to spend ninety minutes of my time too , but on the plus side - as this sort of film goes , this one isn't a terrible example . Insects are some of Earth's most interesting creatures , and this film sets itself apart from many other flicks handling similar topics as it actually takes some time to make that point . . . not everything the film professes is true ( for example , the female praying mantis will only eat her mate if she is hungry ) , but you can't expect a proper lesson on the natural world from a B-movie thriller . The insects that the film focuses on , unsurprisingly , are bees , and we focus on the results of experiments conducted by Dr . Susan Harris , as a number of men are found dead - apparently from excessive exertion during sex ( hey , there's worse ways to die ! ) . The majority of the film is actually rather dull , however , and while some attempt is made at fusing insect life cycles with the human one - the idea behind the plot certainly could have been given a better story to work with . Overall , I can't really recommend Invasion of the Bee Girls - it's not as outlandish as the title suggests it is , nor is it as ' fun ' as you would expect ; but if you do end up watching this , it has to be said that you could do worse .
423729	2248099	105459	5.0	Awful British accents in a silly lost nineties flick	Split Second is one of those nineties films that was forgotten five minutes after it was released ; and upon discovering the film , I've got to say that I can understand why this film was forgotten . Split Second isn't a particularly ' bad ' film ; but it's not very good either . The plot and execution are reminiscent of a number of earlier films , and this one doesn't offer much , if anything at all , in the way of originality . The film also suffers from a series of nuisances that bring the film down . The first and most obvious of these irritations is the large amount of incredibly fake and silly British accents . Much of the cast is British , but the ' hard man ' accents don't bode well with the film . Chief among the rest of the flies in the ointment is the fact that the film takes place in a futuristic environment ; but doesn't make any use of it ! Split Second follows a tough guy copper in London 2008 , after global warming has ravaged the city and , presumably , the rest of the planet . He's on the case of the murder of his partner , which is supposed to have been perpetrated by some strange monster . . . It was the plot that attracted me to this film , and staying true to the rest of the movie ; it's a big disappointment . Rather than run with the idea of a monster on the loose in futuristic London , instead the director focuses on the dull relationship between his central characters ; which mostly revolves around Neil Duncan's student cop unsuccessfully trying to bring out a sensitive side in Rutger Hauer's stone faced policeman , only to be ' amusingly ' brushed away . Hauer's lead performance isn't very impressive , as the actor that stunned audiences in the likes of Blade Runner and The Hitcher looks uncomfortable delivering the painful script , and doesn't work well in the good guy role . Support comes from the likes of Kim Cattral , Pete Postlethwaite and Ian Dury ( of Blockheads fame ) . The action is sometimes well paced and exciting , but more often than not it isn't present ; as the film constantly revolves around the more boring elements of the plot . Don't get me wrong ; there's a lot worse forgotten nineties films out there - but Split Second isn't up to much , and is best left on the shelf in the ' ex-rentals ' section .
421973	2248099	91446	5.0	Dirty and nasty , but lacks staying power	Despite the fact that it was clearly shot on a micro-budget and received an incognito release , Johan Vandewoestijne's Lucker has received cult status thanks to its legendary gore sequences . However , the gore scenes are either lacking in blood and / or completely ridiculous in their execution , and by putting the focus on making the central character as sick as possible ; the director has forgotten to implement any horror with staying power into the movie , and it all feels a little bit flat . The central character - John Lucker - is presented as a man on a mission , and this is conveyed by the way he stays wordless for the majority of the movie , and by the fact that all his sick antics are leading up to one thing ; namely , revenge . We are introduced to Lucker while he's staying at a mental hospital . Naturally , it doesn't take him long to break out and after killing and raping a couple of nurses , he's back on the street where his crime spree continues . Lucker's sick objective revolves around a young girl that he raped and intended to murder - only he didn't get the last part right , and that's what he's aiming to sort out . The film only lasts for just over seventy minutes , which is a definite good thing as the plot is thinly applied even given that run time . A lot of the plot is concerned with watching the central character maraud around murdering people , and it's lucky that the director manages to introduce another sick sequence just about every time the film looks like it's getting a bit too boring . I have no idea what ' Necrophagous ' means , but I'm guessing it has something to do with the fact that the title character enjoys using the women he kills after death . The sequence towards the end where he licks gore from one of his dead victims from his hands is the sickest in the movie . . . but it didn't offend me too much . The style of the film is down and dirty throughout , which definitely does the movie a lot of favours and the only other positive in the film comes from the lead actor - Nick Van Suyt - who does well in providing the right kind of feel for a character as sick as this one . The role doesn't require much actual acting , but at least he looks the part . Overall , I have to say this film doesn't really look up to its reputation , and while I sort of enjoyed it ; I can't recommend it .
423863	2248099	60716	5.0	Mostly lacklustre Italian Gothic horror	I was really expecting something pretty good from The Embalmer . . . but unfortunately all I got was a dreary horror flick with a couple of good ideas and a complete lack of suspense . The film was apparently inspired by Edgar Wallace , who was the inspiration for a lot of the German " Krimi " style of film-making . Not being too familiar with Wallace's work , I can't say how true that is - but The Embalmer is certainly not the Giallo I was expecting . The film is set in Venice , and makes best use of the scenery . . . though it does get a bit boring as the film sets the scene without putting anything relevant to the story with it ! The film was possibly an inspiration on the brilliant Dutch " Giallo " Amsterdamned as it focuses on a killer who lives under the Venetian canals . The killer is selecting young women of Venice and dragging them to the depths of the canal , where he has his way with them - by filling them up with embalming fluid to keep them beautiful for all time ( etc etc ) . A journalist picks up the story , and soon ends up falling in love with the killer's next victim . The main problem with this film is that it's entirely lacklustre ! The cinematography , acting , direction , plot line etc all stink of a group of people that couldn't really be bothered to come up with something half decent . The film is not very suspenseful at all , and a lot of is made up of mind numbing diatribe , which means that when we actually get to watch the killer with his victims , most viewers will already be bored out of their brains . The killer himself looks cool - completed clad in black with a skull mask , but that's the only good thing about him . He makes long winded speeches to his dead victims that were obviously intended to be scary , but actually come as being rather silly . It does boil down to a fairly decent finale , which despite not justifying the rest of the film ; at least ensures that the movie doesn't just leave a bad taste in the viewer's mouths by the end of the film . Overall , this is a good film to track down because it's extremely rare and seen in some circles as a precursor to the Giallo genre - but trust me , it's not worth the time and effort !
422450	2248099	276816	5.0	Another ghost story	Below is a film of two halves . On the one hand , it's a very well directed movie , with some brilliant horror sequences , camera angles and a claustrophobic atmosphere that will make many horror fans foam at the mouth . However , on the other hand it's just another lame ghost story that unfortunately lacks both the invention and the intrigue that it needs to make it a complete horror package . The story is predictable , and basically follows the same path that a hundred ghost stories before it have followed - i . e . man is killed and comes back to haunt those who wronged him . There is an element of originality in the way that the film climaxes ambiguously , but the originality is strewn from it due to the fact that these sorts of twists have become very predictable of late . Cheers , M Night Shyamalan . The story takes place on a World War Two submarine . After finding survivors from another , less fortunate ship , the captain of our ship decides to let them board . We begin a voyage of discovery as certain events transpire and the crew begin to believe that their submarine is haunted . This is a film that needs to be followed in order to fully understand the story , and so people that are tired or just fancy seeing something easy should find something else to watch . The fact that the story is rather difficult to follow hampers the film in the end , however , as when we discover the mystery behind what's been going on , it's a disappointment to say the least . Below also suffers from a rather turgid script , which is riddled with clichés and dull one-liners to deliver the action . The characters are neither believable nor interesting , which doesn't do the film any favours either . It's saving grace is , as mentioned , the directing . David Twohy directs out attention through numerous angles , all of which help to instill the idea that we're on a submarine in the viewer's mind . The special effects are somewhat hokey , but numerous scenes impress ; most notably the part where our hero's find themselves in the middle of a bunch of Manta Rays . If you're a film fan that likes your ghost films to have an interesting story , try The Devil's Backbone instead . If you like technical prowess , you could do a lot worse .
423441	2248099	78405	5.0	If only the murderer had more tools . . .	I don't like slashers where the murderer only uses one murder weapon , so the premise behind The Toolbox Murders sounded great to me - a psychopath with a whole box full of weapons to do his slicing and dicing with ! The opening sequence , which sees a young woman butchered with a drill , gives way to an even better scene where we watch a hot naked chick killed with a nail gun . But for some reason , the film doesn't follow these scenes up with anything similar in quality , and after the good opening ; The Toolbox Murders becomes rather routine . The plot is supposedly based on a true story , which sort of makes the sickness more potent and benefits from a nice gritty atmosphere emanating from the block of apartments that make up the central location . The plot follows a butch man with a toolbox full of goodies who , for some reason , decides to use them for things other than DIY . When a young man's sister is kidnapped , he decides to track her down himself and after being asked for advice by the police ( ? ) , we get treated to the discovery of the identity of the not so helpful repair man . Considering the huge amount of potential this had to be one of the truly great slasher films , The Toolbox Murders is a huge letdown . Our killer has a nail gun and a drill in his toolbox , but that's about it . I was highly disappointed to find that a chainsaw wasn't present and the death scenes we do have , while shocking and gory , aren't what they could have been . The film was , rather unsurprisingly , banned during the eighties as a part of the DPP's " Video Nasty " list , and really that's the only reason to bother viewing it . Tobe Hooper remade this film in 2003 , and while I didn't like the remake much ; it is superior to this movie . The atmosphere is rather nice , as the cheap feel of the movie translates into a gritty and depressing feel that bodes well with the murders . However , the killer's motives are never really explained ; and the central idea of the kidnapped girl doesn't make a lot of sense . The murderer himself is suitably sick , but it's hard to believe that this guy would take it upon himself to begin butchering people with his array of tools . Naturally , the acting is rather crappy and overall , while The Toolbox Murders has its moments ; I can't say that I'm glad I saw it .
422304	2248099	113552	5.0	Nicholas Cage is hilarious in ridiculous crime caper	You want to know the best joke I've heard lately ? The Kiss of Death remake . Despite having great source material to work from ( that being Henry Hathaway's 1947 original ) , Barbet Schroeder's film might as well have been a comedy , as the level of incompetence on display really is mind blowing . The film features a whole range of well known stars , and almost every single one of them is heinously miscast . Nicholas Cage delivers the silliest role of his career as the babyish gangster ' Little Junior ' . Cage's character is this film's answer to Richard Widmark's Tommy Udo , but unlike Widmark ; Cage just can't do the extreme psychotic , and succeeds only in making a fool of himself . Samuel L . Jackson isn't given room to breathe , while Helen Hunt , Michael Rapaport and Ving Rhames are entirely wasted . Perhaps the biggest casting mistake was giving David Caruso the lead role . It's hard not to laugh while he's trying to look hard , and the ginger actor looks completely ridiculous throughout . The only actor in the entire film that has been well cast is Anthony Heald ( Silence of the Lambs ' Dr Chilton ) , who has a very small role as a lawyer . Kiss of the Death is one of the clearest examples of casting with the poster in mind that I've ever seen . The plot follows an unlucky guy who gets arrested after taking ' one last job ' as a favour to his friend . While on the inside , he is asked to rat out his accomplices , and but won't . However , he changes his mind when it comes to the end of his sentence ( oh yes ) . What made the original great was that the story was tight , and by concentrating on just a handful of characters ; the audience was able to care for their plight . This movie doesn't benefit from that , as the film needs a whole load of characters so that a load of big names can star , and it harms the film as the whole thing is far too convoluted . Not much thought has gone into any scene in this film either , and certain plot threads seem to come out of nowhere ; the lead character's relationship with the babysitter being a good example of an idea that the film simply throws at you . You really need to stretch your imagination with this movie , as several things don't make sense ; and the fact that all in all , this film is bad ensures that stretching the imagination isn't easy . The ending is similar to that of the original , but here we don't get the impression that it's come about as a result of the characters ; and Samuel L . Jackson's last moment on screen throws mud in the eye of the dark tone that a story like this should have . All I can say is that Kiss of Death is actually an apt name for this film , as Barbet Schroeder and co have embraced a good idea and killed it .
421913	2248099	36261	5.0	Not the best version of this classic tale	The Phantom of the Opera is one of the greatest horror stories ever written . No wait , scratch that understatement ; it's one of the greatest stories ever written , period . The Gothic setting of the story mixed with the tragedy of it's lead and the heartbreak of his lust for the young opera singer combine to make a very interesting and unique tale indeed , but when it comes to cinema ; it's never had a truly satisfying adaptation . Sure , the 1925 Lon Chaney version is excellent ; but it's dated . When you consider that it was made nearly 80 years ago , though , that is to be expected . This version isn't a truly satisfying version either ; it's not bad , but considering how amazing it's source story is ; it's certainly not great . The main problem with this film is that it's perspective is wrong . There's far too much emphasis on the music side of the story , and the much more interesting element of the tragedy of the phantom's fate and his resulting obsession with the opera singer are left by the wayside , almost a co-star in their own film . I'm really sorry , but I have an acute dislike for opera music . Quite frankly ; it's awful . Operatic vocals can be good if given the right music to go with ( e . g . Nightwish ) , but on their own or with classical music , they're more painful than pulling your toenails out with pliers ( not that I've ever pulled my toenails out with pliers , of course , but I'm imagining it is ) . Of course , in Phantom of the Opera , you have to expect SOME opera , but at the end of the day ; this is a horror film , and as it has more opera music than horror ; it's safe to say that it's got it's perspective wrong . The film also seems keen to have moments of comedy in it , which works sometimes ; but more often than not feels like an awkward addition to the film . Another disappointment is the ending ; gone is the lavish and expansive ending that we were treated to in the 1925 version , and we have to make do with a very small , unsatisfying climax . Which pretty much sums up the film's relationship with its title character , actually . On the good side , this film has some nice elements ; the sets are grand and lavish , and overall very refreshing and a treat for the eyes . The film also looks very nice on the whole , especially when you consider that it's over sixty years old . The direction is assured , if not overly brilliant and the performances range from good enough , to very good ; with the excellent Claude Rains being at the business end of that statement . Ten years prior to this film , Rains carried a movie with his voice alone in The Invisible Man , but here we get the voice and the screen presence of a man who is undoubtedly one of the finest actors to ever grace the screen . If you're a fan of Phantom of the Opera , then this adaptation may well be to your liking . If your not , but want to see a film version of it , then I recommend starting with Lon Chaney's version . It's better .
422145	2248099	839880	5.0	The 13th to Last Lakeside Massacre on the Left	Lake Dead is clearly a rip off of much better films such as The Last House on the Left and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre ; but to be honest some of my favourite films are rip offs of those films so I wasn't too worried going into it . That was until I realised that most of my favourite rip offs ( films like The House on the Edge of the Park and Death Weekend ) were made during the heyday of horror when even a talentless bunch of hacks could churn out something good with a decent location and a fistful of film stock . Unfortunately the makers of Lake Dead weren't able to follow suit ; but to the film's credit , it's entertaining enough stuff and I cant really criticise it too much considering the type of film it is . The plot focuses very simply on three sisters who go with their friends to check out a motel left to them by their grandfather ; who just so happened to have died a rather grisly death . The sisters have their eyes on a big sale price ; but get a surprise once they arrive at the motel when they discover that their long lost relatives are a bunch of psychos . . . Anyone with more than a passing interest in this type of film will have seen most of what happens here many times before , which is a bit of a shame because the director obviously had good intentions and the film might have been decent with just a little bit of originality . The characters are all very samey and clichéd and thus hard to care about , or follow . The three sisters are very nice looking at least . . . but this novelty wears off pretty quickly . The setting is good however and the cinematography is nice and crisp . . . although actually a gritty style would have suited the film better . The psychotic relatives are not all that interesting either and pale in comparison even to the family in the remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre . The gore is well used and fairly realistic and there's a fair few death scenes featuring including one that sees someone have his face caved in with the blunt end of a shotgun . However , it's the lack of originality that ultimately condemns the film and if you're looking for something you haven't seen before ; feel free to look elsewhere .
423656	2248099	408345	5.0	Nothing you haven't seen a million times before	In this film , Mary Lynn Rajskub plays exactly the same character that she came to fame with in the hit show 24 , and that is very fitting in a film that sees everyone in roles that they've been in before and a script that features a load of events that have happened in films many times before . The plot is the age-old ' family kidnapped , bad situation ' sort of thing , and unfortunately it isn't handled with any panache and anyone that has seen more than a handful of movies wont be dazzled by this one . However , films like this often provide a couple of hours worth of mindless entertainment despite being forgotten moments after the credits have rolled ; but alas , Firewall doesn't even manage that most basic of thriller elements . The plot takes in ideas of kidnapping and bank robbing and sees security specialist Harrison Ford being blackmailed into helping rob the bank that he's being paid to protect . His family are being held to ransom by a nasty ( British ) villain and they've put a whole load of things in place to ensure that the security guy can't get out of the sticky situation he's found himself in . . . This film is like a retirement home for actors that are past their best . Harrison Ford looks old and tired in the lead role and while he has gotten away with his lack of acting ability in previous , and better films ; he doesn't manage it here . This isn't helped by the fact that the usually talented Virginia Madsen is completely unbelievable as his wife . She might have convinced as his daughter , though . Cult actors Robert Patrick , Robert Forster and the great Alan Arkin appear in roles that don't allow them to make any kind of impression , which is a shame and only Paul Bettany , who worked with director Richard Loncraine on 2004's Wimbledon doesn't adhere to this trend ; but like the rest of the cast , isn't able to pull off a good performance , despite being one of the major protagonists . The way that the plot moves is extremely unimaginative , and basically follows Harrison Ford skipping from one clichéd scene to the next . The idea of the kidnappers and the central family having to share the same space isn't capitalised on at all , and the action sequences lack any real flair and come off like a bad TV movie . Overall , not only is this derivative and boring , it's not very well made either . Most of the cast have been better in the past and this plot has translated to the screen in better ways several times . This reviewer is unimpressed .
423897	2248099	106449	5.0	An omnibus without much merit	What we have here is a made for TV omnibus horror film . If that doesn't fill you full of confidence , the fact that the trio of tales are directed by highly successful horror directors John Carpenter and Tobe Hooper might , although I cant say it did for me as I don't rate either of these two as highly as many . The title of the film is ' Body Bags ' , and this is reflected in the wraparound story , which features egomaniac John Carpenter as a coroner inspecting dead bodies . His bit part in the film smacks of " look at me , I'm John Carpenter " ; and I dare say he added this in just so people would get to know his face . Anyway , the film takes off with the everyday ( in this sort of film ) story of a serial killer . We follow the tribulations of working at a gas station , as a young girl has to deal with someone trying to murder her as well as a bunch of difficult customers . This tale isn't bad , but it's not very good either . Carpenter builds the suspense , but it's all very empty and the fact that it's the first tale doesn't disguise the fact that it feels like an afterthought . Carpenter also directs tale number two , which is the best segment of the film . This part takes horror from human vanity , and we follow Stacy Keach as he worries about going bald and ends up at a hair replacement clinic , where he gets more than he bargained for when he applies for their treatment . Stories about someone's body rebelling against them are always more frightening than men with knives , and although tongue in cheek , Carpenter keeps the horror coming as we are drawn into the subject's plight . The ending is good , and shows a little bit of ingenuity in a film that seriously lacks it . The third and final tale is helmed by Tobe Hooper ( maybe Carpenter couldn't be bothered ) , and for me is the weakest of the bunch . We follow a baseball player who becomes the unfortunate victim of a car accident . After losing his right eye , he is given the chance for a new one ; but it means having the eye of a dead man transplanted into his eye socket . . . I'm sure you can guess what's coming , although it is worth noting that this film predates Jap horror , The Eye , by almost a decade . Hooper's section is just too dull to be an effective horror tale , and the way that he injects religion into the tale just doesn't work . Mark Hamill ( of Luke Skywalker fame ) takes the lead role , and watch out for Roger Corman as his doctor . The film features quite a few famous names , actually , including Wes Craven , Sam Raimi , Twiggy , Debbie Harry and Robert Carradine in bit parts . I can't really recommend it though . . . Body Parts is just too forgettable .
423635	2248099	87803	6.0	Cold and lifeless vision of the future	I have to admit that I've not read George Orwell's original novel ' 1984 ' ; but everyone knows the story and many elements of it have made their way into popular culture . Since I've not read the book ; I can't comment on whether or not this film version is faithful to the literature , but apparently this is one of the more faithful movie versions . Director Michael Radford takes the subject material and uses it to paint an incredibly bleak vision of the future ; one so bleak that all the warmth of the movie is thoroughly drained from it and we are left with is incredibly lifeless and hard to get on with . Our main character is a man named Smith . Smith works in a people intensive environment where he is charged with the task of rewriting history . This future society has been divided into three parts ; and we focus on Oceania , of which London is the capital . The state is ruled over by ' Big Brother ' and thinking outside of the box is against the law . Smith falls in love with a woman named Julia ; which is of course against the rules of the totalitarian society . The movie takes more time instilling the situation of the future than it does on the actual characters ; so while we get a chilling portrait of how this modern society is ran and the rules that govern it ; we are unfortunately not given much in the way of reasons to care about our main characters ' plights . The story itself has some very interesting points to make , however ; and depending on your stance , you may well believe that modern society is moving ever closer to the ' Big Brother ' of this film ; here in the UK we are already being threatened with the prospect of ID cards , security cameras and ISP's spying on our internet connections , so maybe Orwell's vision is not such a distant possibility . Going back to the film ; it does have to be said that it is well made . The acting is generally very good and the cinematography very much fits the style and atmosphere that the story demands . Some say that this film is terrifying ; though the disengagement from the lead characters made it less so for me , and this is definitely the main problem . I haven't seen any other versions of this story , however ( unless Brazil counts ) and while I'm not overly fussed with this film ; it is at least worth a look .
422600	2248099	1204979	6.0	Better than expected . . . but still rather silly and dull	The original Vacancy was a rather simple but also rather effective and well done little horror film ; and while it certainly wasn't brilliant , I did at least enjoy it . I do have to say that I never really thought the film needed a follow-up , and after finding out that Vacancy 2 would be a direct to video release , I did abandon all hope . . . but to my surprise , the film is better than I thought it would be an almost qualifies as being a decent horror film . Naturally I was expecting this film to be more or less the same as the original ; but actually it does take a ( slightly ) more unexpected route . This film is actually a prequel to the original . The plot begins with a seedy motel where the employees spy on couples having sex and then sells the tapes to a marketer who gets rid of them on the black market . Things are turned upside down one day when a man arrives with a prostitute , and kills her . The hotel owners then hatch a plan with the murderer to make snuff films instead of sex tapes . The film attempts to explain how exactly the staff of the motel in the original film got into the business of killing people ; but due to the bizarre plot decisions spread throughout the film , Vacancy 2 actually creates more questions than it answers . For a start , why set it a different motel all together ? Also , I don't remember seeing ANY of the characters of this film in the original . The saddest part is that most of these changes are put in place because of the ending , which could have been a lot neater if only the filmmakers were a bit braver ! Still , on its own merits ; the film is entertaining , if shallow and silly , entertainment . The victim characters are just your average horror film fodder and neither invokes any emotion towards them nor do they really provide any interest . The team of killers is slightly more interesting . . . though not much more . Still , it would be silly to go into this expecting anything more than just a throwaway ninety minutes and the film was at least more entertaining than I thought it would be . I'd say it's just about worth a look if you liked the original .
422777	2248099	83807	6.0	Debbie might have had fun , but I didn't .	The original Debbie Does Dallas is somewhat considered a classic in it's own right ; it's one of the entry level porn films , and I would assume that most teenage boys will have discussed it at some point or other in their school career ; but the same cant be said for Debbie Does Dallas 2 , or at least I don't think it can ; I'm not really sure because the version I saw was cut down to seventy minutes and had a big oval blob in the middle of the screen every time there was a sex scene ! I guess I got hold of a copy of the prudish version ( thanks , BBFC ) . Of course you may wonder what I was thinking watching a porn flick with all the good bits cut out . . . and to be honest , I struggle for an answer to that question . Anyway , the plot has a lot of room for plenty of sex , and focuses on a brothel . Debbie ( Bambi Woods reprising her role from the first film ) goes to stay with her aunt who runs this brothel , and naturally wants to become one of its employees . From there it's basically country music and sex scenes ; some of them looked like they may have been decent , I'm not really sure for the reasons already mentioned . I'll give the benefit of the doubt since the version I saw was chopped . . . but I probably won't bother tracking down an uncut version .
423566	2248099	74113	6.0	More hardcore than Lewis Carroll intended . . .	This film is a musical hardcore porn version of Lewis Carroll's classic story ' Alice in Wonderland ' , and so as you can probably imagine , it's a little bit strange ! That being said , Carroll's Wonderland is ripe for fusing with a ' sexual awakening ' plot line , and really I'm surprised it took until 1976 for someone to make a film like this ! Bud Townsend's film was obviously shot on a very low budget and the film has to rely on it's numerous distractions in order to stay interesting ; and these range from the silly costumes , even sillier songs , and of course ; a few hardcore sex scenes . The film is not too far removed from the original story really and naturally we focus a young girl named Alice . She's care-free and dresses below her age , much to the dismay of her boyfriend . It's not long before a rabbit turns up and she follows him down the rabbit hole ( after drinking a shrinking potion ) and ends up in Wonderland , where she meets the usual assortment of characters ; although in this film , they're all a bit more interested in sex than they were in the original story . The film really is very unprofessional and the effect is not too far removed from a school play . The costumes are ridiculous and the acting is terrible throughout . The film also features a plethora of songs that are very silly and helps to increase the ridiculousness of the film . However , despite all the problems ; this version of Alice in Wonderland does have a lot of charm and is at least a fun viewing . There's a fair few hardcore sex scenes ; but the focus of it actually seems to be more on the plot line , and all the sex is entwined in the story , with Lewis Carroll's characters the inspiration for most of it ! The film apparently underwent some cuts during its lifetime and the version I saw professed to have put everything that was cut back in ; although the film still only runs at about eighty minutes and fifteen of them are taken up by the final sex scene ! Overall , this is certainly an interesting film that will no doubt be a target for most fans of cult cinema ; but it is a very amateur production and even rated purely as a hardcore porn film ; it falls down compared to others in the genre . Still . . . I don't regret seeing it .
422526	2248099	83192	6.0	Marginally successful haunted house TV flick	Considering it's both a TV movie and a haunted house movie , it has to be said that This House Possessed really is rather good ; although only on its own terms . The plot follows the story of a burnt out writer and singer of awful pop songs as he moves into a modern computerised house with his live-in nurse and later girlfriend . It's not long before strange things start happening in the house and the nurse comes to believe she may have some connection with it . One problem this film has is the plotting ; the first half of the movie is basically a soap opera and while it's not especially uninteresting ; it's not really what I tuned in for and it takes a while for the movie to finally get going . The first half of the film does , however , set the characters up , which benefits the film well later on . Naturally , owing to the fact that this is a TV movie , there's no gore and little violence ; but there's a few death scenes and most of them are pretty decent . It all boils down to a twist that is made so obvious that I'm not really sure if it's actually supposed to be a twist at all . The idea of the house taking ' revenge ' on it's inhabitants is hardly original and even the computer idea had been done previously in ' Demon Seed ' , but the film generally plays on it's central ideas well and it is at least an interesting film . The film has apparently become quite rare and I wouldn't say it's worth a lot of trouble to track down but if you can find a copy , it is at least worth a look .
421933	2248099	56875	6.0	Some very weird religious rites in HG Lewis ' splatter " masterpiece " !	Herschell Gordon Lewis has a lot of things to be proud of himself for with regards to this film . Aside from being the oldest film on the BBFC's " Video Nasty " list , Blood Feast is also the film most often credited as " the first splatter flick ever made " . Technically , the movie doesn't have a lot in it's favour , as it's just as inept as most HG Lewis films ; but at least it proves once and for all the British Board of Film Classification doesn't have a sense of humour , as this movie is more likely to make you cry tears of laughter than deprave and / or corrupt . Seeing as this is the first splatter film , HG really deserves a lot of credit , as he was pretty much walking new ground with this film ; and the gore , as ever , is filthy and disgusting ; and would have took a lot of guts on the directors ' part to dare release this film back in 1963 . The plot takes in the classic idea of other society's codes of conduct , and follows an Egyptian caterer who offers to put on his own special ' Egyptian Feast ' at the Birthday party of a young girl . However , he forgot to mention that he's been murdering women and stealing their body parts in order to resurrect his goddess . . . It's clear that the Godfather of Gore isn't too concerned with realism . The murders and the reasons behind them are expected to be silly , but the director packs the film with further ridiculous details , and it all helps to make this film the fine piece of trash that it is . Things such as the policeman discussing the case details with his girlfriend , the newspaper headline that reads " Legs Cut Off ! " and my personal favourite ; the fact that the murderer is working from a book titled " Ancient WEIRD Religious Rites " make this the film that it is . Herschell would go on to make gorier films ( such as The Gore Gore Girls ) , but this one is still pretty gritty , especially for it's time . We see guts cut out , tongues pulled out and more . The actor in the role of the Egyptian psycho , Mal Arnold , really does look hilarious with his blue hair and polished appearance ; but perhaps best of all is the fact that he's doing a ( bad ) Christopher Lee impression ! Every scene in the film in almost completely inept , with atrocious acting featuring throughout . . . but hey , it's all in good fun and so long as you aren't too bothered about technical details , Blood Feast is a must see film .
423164	2248099	96046	6.0	Low key , but creepy little horror flick	Scarecrows shows what you can do with a very flimsy plot line and a low budget . Rather than concentrate on characters or story , the film leans more towards aesthetics ; as the tale is portrayed within a very creepy atmosphere , and the central monsters of the title capitalise well on their natural scare factor . Like clowns , scarecrows are eerie creations and it's clear that director William Wesley knows that , as their dark and foreboding image makes up the backbone of this tale of terror . The only real theme that is put on display in this film comes from the idea of greed , as it is that very thing that gets all the central protagonists into life-threatening danger . The film follows a bunch of soldiers that have stolen a lot of money . They take a pilot and his daughter hostage and force the pair to take them to Mexico ; but the ride has a hitch when one of the crooks decides that he doesn't want to share the money , and parachutes out of the plane with the loot . His partners in crime are soon on his tail , but the story has another twist when it turns out that the field they've jumped into is infested with scarecrows that want to do more than keep the birds off the crops ! This film isn't very well known and it's not hard to see why . Scarecrows is very short , running at about seventy minutes when you don't include the credit sequences . The film also feels very low-key , as the focus is more on the atmosphere than anything else , which can leave the film lacking at several intervals . Scarecrows is basically a glorified zombie movie , and pretty much plays out like one as the characters are picked off by their unworldly adversaries . The fact that the entire film takes place in what appears to be real time and in only one location ensures that it benefits from a claustrophobic tension , which benefits a film like this greatly . There isn't a lot of gore here , as the killings don't tend to be very bloodthirsty , and most of the violence takes place off-screen . The killings aren't bad , however , and I was impressed with the way that the film handled the scarecrows ' victims after they had been savaged . Overall , this film certainly won't win any awards , and you won't really be missing much by not seeing it ; but any horror fan that gets the chance to see Scarecrows probably won't be disappointed .
423884	2248099	95941	6.0	Absurd sick comedy	Lucio Fulci is one of the leading names in gore-soaked horror cinema , and Touch of Death certainly does that reputation proud ! Fulci's films started to get worse as his career progressed ( with the exception of the hilarious Cat in the Brain in 1990 ) , and as this film was released in 1988 ; you can count on it not being as good as his previous output . In fact , with films like Don't Torture a Duckling and The Beyond in mind ; Touch of Death is one of Fulci's weaker efforts , but even so - there's plenty here to delight the man's fans . The film is clearly meant to be something of comedy , but the comedy is more of the absurd , over the top variety than one that will have you in stitches . Fulci's use of music helps to instill the absurdity of the film , which sees lonely widower / gigolo Lester Parson taking women home and putting them to use . He likes to mutilate them in horrible ways , such as beating them with a stick and chopping them up with a chainsaw ; and just to add to the proceedings , he eats them too . Fulci also installs a subplot about the investigation into the murders , and the murderer's descent into madness . This film is something a prelude to Cat in the Brain , and it's obvious that Fulci had Touch of Death in mind when he made his self-starring vehicle , as many of the gore scenes from that film are taken from this one . The scenes of gore are really quite nasty , but their impact is lessened by the comic tone . The first scene of gore sees our ' hero ' going to work with a chainsaw ( surely horror cinema's finest weapon ) , and then putting the remains of his victim into a meat grinder . Then we are treated to a beating scene ( which features some of Fulci's trademark eye violence ) , a nasty sequence involving a car , a corpse having it's feet cut off and several other scenes along the same line . The film is really dirty ; with the poor cinematography adding brilliantly to the overall unclean feel of the movie . The acting is typically low level , but the actors portray their ( mostly silly ) characters with gusto , and the result is a film that people will like more it's fun value than its credibility . Being a Fulci fan , I am more susceptible to this sort of trash ; and I cant really say that non-Fulci fans will get much of a kick out of it .
421692	2248099	87050	6.0	Another so-so film based on one of Stephen King's books	Stephen King is often cited to be the father of modern horror , and this view isn't wholly unfounded . King's stories have had a large impact upon the horror genre , and many of them are very good stories in their own right also . However , when it comes to translating King's words onto the screen ; many filmmakers have proved that they are not up to the task . I haven't read the book , ' Children of the Corn ' , but I'm sure it's better than this movie . While the film isn't especially bad ; it's hardly a tour de-force of horror cinema either , and like many Stephen King films ; this one could have been a hell of a lot better . Actually , this story isn't one of King's better efforts ; it follows a small town whose children murder their parents on the instructions of a mysterious preacher ; a little kid calling himself Isaac . The story picks up three years after this terrible event when a young couple drive into town for some reason . They find the village completely devoid of adults and it isn't long until they discover what's happened and seek to put an end to it ! This film has missed several opportunities , the most glaring of which is the subterranean manifestation that dwells beneath the soil in the cornfields . We get several glimpses of this creature , but we never get to see it properly ; and because of this , the monster is about as threatening as a bunch of little kids . Oh wait . Anyway , the film draws parallels with other evil kids films such as Village of the Damned in the way it plays out , but it never really gets out of first gear . While the atmosphere of the town is foreboding and well done on the whole , the plotting isn't very exciting and there's very few moments of real tension or suspense , which ensures the film isn't as engaging as it could have been . The cornfields and the corn that inhabits said field's makes for an unlikely horror prop , and some scenes within the fields are genuinely creepy . The kids themselves are rather well done also , with both of the main ones having good screen presence . If you were to pigeonhole King's films into ' good ' and ' bad ' , this one would firmly be in the latter side . On it's own , however , it's not all that bad , and if you're a fan of King's work , you'll no doubt find something to like here . Or you might hate it for not living up to the book , one of the two .
423698	2248099	82812	6.0	Unfortunately rubbish , but not a complete dead loss	Overall , I have to rate Terror Eyes as a shame , as it has so much going for it ; but unfortunately , most of it is lost under terrible plotting , which often reduces the film to merely a lot of death scenes strung together . Terror Eyes appears to take a lot of influence from the popular Italian Giallo sub-genre , and that is never a bad thing ; although the film still fits firmly into the slasher sub-genre , which often is a bad thing . The modus operandi of the killer here is rather odd , but it works rather well as we follow a biker dressed all in black leathers who enjoys going round decapitating various members of a night school , before dumping their heads in the nearest container of water . Naturally , all this carnage prompts a police investigation ; but the officers on the case are more interested in spurting terrible lines of dialogue than finding the killer , and so the murders continue . We are introduced to several red herrings along the way , although suspicion often seems to fall on the school's anthropology professor . My only reason for seeing this film is due to the fact that it was included on the DPP Video Nasty list back in the eighties . However , it turns out that this is one of the many films that don't deserve their place on a list of notorious films , as there's very little blood and even macabre incidents such as severed heads being thrown into fish tanks etc never seem very shocking . The film is directed by Ken Hughes , the same man responsible for both the James Bond spoof Casino Royale and , rather more shockingly , children's classic Chitty Chitty Bang Bang ! It's seems obvious that one of the film's problems is that the director isn't experienced in directing horror films , and this is shown through the almost complete lack of suspense and blasé attitude when it comes to the plot . The film doesn't feature any big name stars , although Rachel Ward makes a mark and the rest of the support cast aren't too bad considering the material they were working with . Overall , I'd like to have liked this film more ; the Giallo influences are good and the film has potential , but this is not realised and Terror Eyes is merely a mundane slasher flick .
422541	2248099	64443	6.0	Surprisingly decent British horror flick	I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by this one ; I went in expecting nothing and actually found a more than decent horror movie . The film is directed by Michael Armstrong , a British man who would go on to direct the excellent ' Mark of the Devil ' a year later . The title is a bit misleading as it makes the film out to be a haunted house movie , when in fact it's closer to the slasher genre if anything . The film takes place in sixties ' swinging ' London and focuses on a group of young friends . They're out one night and looking for a party when one of them suggests that they go to an old house that is supposedly haunted . Their party turns sour when one of the friends gets sliced by an unseen killer and , believing they would be in trouble with the local bobby's if they come forward , they decide to dispose of the body themselves . I have to admit that the film is really quite predictable and even though it's a " whodunit " , there's never a great deal of mystery surrounding anything in the film . The film is very well shot , however , and the director does a good job of capturing the swinging sixties feel . It's also a very colourful film , which is nice . The acting is rubbish of course , but that's not too important and it all boils down to a nice little twist at the end . I can't say this is brilliant stuff ; but it's not bad and worth a look for horror fans .
422384	2248099	120841	6.0	Fun enough , for what it is	I've got to admit that I liked the original Species quite a lot , and even though this movie suffers from some terrible dialogue and an overall ridiculous plot ; for what it is , I've got to say that Species II is a decent sequel . Three stars from the first film return to their roles ; series pin-up Natasha Henstridge , Marg Helgenberger and , of course , the all-action hero Michael Madsen . A sequel to the original film really could have written itself as the door was left wide-open at the end , but instead of following on directly from the first film ; we've got a thread about a mission to mars thrown in to further things . Three astronauts go to mars , and one of them comes back infected by alien DNA . The supposed national hero lusts for the recreated ' Sil ' ( a clone , a bit like Ripley was in Alien 4 ) , who finds herself confined to a high security prison under the command of Dr . Laura Baker . However , when the astronaut begins killing women ; the government realise that some serious clean-up work is in order , and proceed to track down Press Lenox ; apparently the only man capable of helping to stop the alien . The film doesn't have a lot of depth as aside from letting us into the idea of the alien originating from mars ; it's pretty much just a spin-off from the original . Characters from the first film return in identical roles , while new blood such as Mykelti Williamson don't do much to make the film any more interesting on the character front . It's obvious that this film wasn't given big studio backing as it all feels very cheap , and this is mostly down to the rubbish CGI , which was also featured in the original film . In fairness , here it isn't used as often and the effects that don't use computers do look rather nice . There's not a lot of gore on display , but there's some inventive kill scenes and the alien , being based on a H . R . Giger creation , is suitably imaginative . It's a shame that original star Natasha Henstridge is so underused , as her role feels a lot like it's only in the film as a tie to the original ; and I'm sure that I'm not the only one who wouldn't have minded seeing more of her . Still , while this film really isn't very good ; you can't expect brilliance from a sequel to a minor mid-nineties hit , and I did enjoy watching it .
423063	2248099	75342	6.0	Good on the atmosphere , but lacking in action	Supposedly based on actual events that took place in Texarkana shortly after the end of the First World War . The film takes on a documentary style , which is shown through the rather corny voice-over and is mixed with footage of a man in a hood bumping various youngsters off . Given that the film is based on a true story , this actually turned out to be a good way to film it ; although those who are going into this film expecting a slasher along the lines of Halloween or Black Christmas are likely to be disappointed . The film plays out more like a profile of the serial killer , although since not much is known about the actual hooded maniac that terrorised Texas back in the forties , the film doesn't go too deep either . The film focuses more on the police and the local residents rather than the actual killer , and we follow the effect that the murder spree has had on the town , through both the residents ' actions and the baffled police investigation into the crimes . The main strongpoint of this movie definitely lies in its atmosphere , and director Charles B . Pierce does well at ensuring that the fear of the locals always shines through . These is shown by having the local people board up their windows and buy all the weapons from the local gun shops , which in turn ensures that the audience is aware of both the killer's actions and their implications on the local townspeople . The director also does well at presenting the southern style to the film , as all the people speak with thick accents and it gives the film an element of realism . However , all this is well and good ; but there's not enough action , and while this film stands out among real-life serial killer films thanks to the way that it shows the murders and their implications ; there's not enough action , and at times the film can feel rather flat . The film could definitely do with a decent release also , as the copy that I saw was too dark during the night scenes and at times it was difficult to see what was going on . There's an element of slapstick comedy in the film as well , which makes it more entertaining . . . but I can't help but think it's rather inappropriate . Overall , this film is definitely worth seeing for the cult horror fan ; but personally , I don't rate it as a classic .
422083	2248099	48254	6.0	Interesting early Kubrick	Stanley Kubrick's career really took off in 1956 , upon the release of his first masterpiece ; " The Killing " , after which he would go on to make many much loved cinema classics such as " Dr Strangelove " , " The Shining " and " A Clockwork Orange " , to name a few . This movie is , however , no masterpiece ; but that's not to say it's without it's plus points . First and foremost , this movie is admirable for it's directing , which is excellent . Of course Stanley Kubrick would go on to show himself as a genius behind the camera , and this movie is an early taste of that genius in the directorial department . Secondly , despite the B-grade cast , the acting is not bad at all . It's not marvelous , but considering the cast's accomplishments , previously and after this movie was made , it's better than one would expect . One of the movie's major flaws , however , is its lack of ideas . There are some nice ideas in the film , such as the part where Gloria tells her story to a backdrop of her sister doing ballet , and the Rear Window style way that the Gloria and Davy meet , but as the film is only 67 minutes long , it felt at times that Kubrick was spending too long on certain sequences , which is a problem if the movie is as short as this one is as it looked as though Kubrick was just dragging things out in order to meet an acceptable running time . That might be so bad in a longer film , but here it's not good . This movie is a nice , taut little thriller and is definitely recommended to people that want to see some early Kubrick and thereby see how he developed as a filmmaker , but it's not a great film and I don't recommend going into this movie expecting it to be one .
422415	2248099	94962	6.0	Poorly made and shabby , but fun , low budget zombie rubbish	If you don't like zombie movies , you'd be best off making sure that you never see The Dead Next Door . . . but if you do like zombie flicks , this might provide some amusement . While the film is never exceptional ( even in the low budget zombie sub-genre ) , it does have some positive aspects , which pull it out of the truly abysmal . Despite it's more than obvious low budget , it's clear that the producers of this flick wanted to do some things with the genre that haven't been done before . Of course , by 1988 ; zombie films had pretty much been explored to the max , but fairly original ideas such as the religious cult that want the zombies protected and the thing with half-human , half-zombie give this film some things to call it's own . The plot is a straight Romero-rip off , and it sees the world being plagued by zombies . We follow a team of government agents calling themselves ' Zombie Squad ' , whose task it is to , basically , kill zombies . Their job is made more difficult by a cult of religious weirdo's , who strangely think that the zombie is worth saving . . . On the technical side , everything about this film is rubbish . The script is ridiculous , and little gems like " I'm a zombie now " show this . The acting matches the script , and once again is a load of rubbish . Someone called Pete Ferry takes the lead role , and does his best impression of Bruce Campbell . He's not the king of B-movies , but his performance does ensure that it's obvious that this movie isn't to be taken seriously . The closing credit of ' you have just witnessed the awesome talents of : ' is a nice touch , and shows that the crew were only having a laugh while making this film . The special effects are gory and disgusting , but also very stupid and impossible to take seriously . Still , they beat lazy effects like those of Resident Evil ( the movie ) hands down . The way that a lot of the characters have been given horror director names , such as Raimi , shows that the makers are fans of this sort of film , and that fact might even be inspiring if this production wasn't so unprofessional . On the whole , there's no denying that this isn't very good ; but on the other hand , it's a decent waste of time and there's definitely something here for zombie fans .
422119	2248099	52602	7.0	Entertaining Vincent Price ' haunted house ' movie	This film is a lot better than you might expect . It follows the story of a wayward million dollars that is believed to be hidden within the walls of an old house . The inhabitants of the house are a female writer and her crew of servants . . . . oh , and a prowler known as ' the bat ' , who evidently wants the fortune for himself . The Bat is notable for a great macabre atmosphere that creates a sense of claustrophobia , as the house is in the middle of nowhere . It's also notable for an early performance from Vincent Price , who appears as the doctor , Malcolm Wells . Price was better known in 1959 for the William Castle classic " House on Haunted Hill " , but ' The Bat ' is still an able entry in his list of acting credits . Price evidently grew as an actor throughout the 60's and 70's , but his early performances always have that x-factor that would go on to instill the man in the hearts of horror fans forever , and his performance here has that also . The story itself has lots of room for tension and intrigue , and it makes best use of it as the film is constantly intriguing , and many scenes , particularly the ones involving the menacing bad guy , are filled with suspense . The film is at it's best when ' the bat ' is on the prowl , and features several lovely shots of the fiend poking his arm through various crevices in the house . The house itself is riddled with various traps and secret passages in true haunted house style , and it adds to the inventiveness and effectiveness of the movie . The film gives the twist away far too early , however , and it kind of spoils the ending as it turns out that , logically , there's only one person who the bat could possibly be . It doesn't really matter though , as the film is always a lot of fun and if you're a fan of Vincent Price ( and who isn't ? ! ) , or just classic horror movies in general , I highly recommend this movie .
422884	2248099	65233	7.0	Surreal and bleak	As other reviewers have mentioned , it's difficult to know what to make of this film - and I suffered from the same problem ! Go Go Second Time Virgin is as surreal and strange as its title suggests it is . The basis behind the plot is relatively simple , but I have no idea what the film is trying to say and that's what enforces the weirdness of the film . Go Go Second Tim Virgin starts with a rape sequence and from there we focus on two teenagers ; one of which being the girl that was raped . The pair of them are depressed , and the girl insists that she wants to die and asks the boy to do it , but he refuses , preferring a different solution to the problem . The film is stylishly shot ; most of it is in black and white although certain sequences are portrayed in colour . The bleak atmosphere is the main point of the film ; this film is extremely bleak throughout and not a great deal of fun , which might not please anyone going into this film expecting something more fun , considering the film's ' pinku ' origins . There's not a great deal of sleaze in the film - the rape scenes are not overly graphic and there's not a great deal of gore either . I won't name this film as a favourite or anything like that , but it's an interesting little flick that is definitely worth seeing , and therefore comes recommended .
422799	2248099	66249	7.0	Fun , but doesn't work as a satire	I'm a big fan of Sherlock Holmes , especially the classic films starring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce - and I'm also a big fan of Billy Wilder , having rated all ten of his films that I saw prior to this one in the very top tier of rankings . However , I just could not click with this film ; I can see why others like it a lot , but there's just too much wrong with it for my liking . I go into Billy Wilder films with high expectations , because the man was a genius ; but I really don't know what happened here . I realise that this is supposed to be satire , and the idea behind the film is funny ; but at the same time , it's just not Sherlock Holmes . We are presented with a very camp and non-too clever character , which Wilder tells us is Sherlock Holmes . Ignoring the fact that Holmes would never ask Watson's permission to do anything , we are meant to believe that is the a ' funny version ' same character that Rathbone portrayed so well all those years earlier . Like I said , I know that this is satire and so you cant expect the film to play out seriously - but for satire to work , it needs a grounding in what it's making fun of ; and really , the detective in this film could be a completely original one , as he certainly isn't Sherlock Holmes ! Ignoring what I've just said , The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes still offers a solid two hours of fun . But this is what really annoys me - the film has got the plotting spot on . . . if only the satire had been concentrated on a bit more , this could have been really good . The film follows Watson's memoirs of some of the less successful missions he has accompanied Holmes on , and we see the duo travelling to Scotland and meeting up with all manner of things from dwarfs ( naturally ) , Christopher Lee and the Lock Ness Monster . The plot plays out well , and despite putting the focus on humour ; there's a fair amount of mystery here too . The acting really got on my nerves , as nearly everyone has been miscast . Robert Stephens makes a terrible Sherlock Holmes , and accounts for a lot of the reason the satire doesn't work . Colin Blakely is amusing as Watson , but he's not the actor I'd have cast - and the only really likable casting in the film is Christopher Lee , but that's more for the fact that he's Christopher Lee than because of inspired casting . You would be forgiven , having read this far , for thinking that I don't like this film . That's not true , it was a good time and I enjoyed it - but I wouldn't recommend going into it with the high hopes that usually come with Wilder films .
422140	2248099	52667	7.0	Interesting and inventive fifties monster movie	I'm not a big fan of fifties monster movies in general , but this one is pretty decent . The film was directed by Riccardo Freda , although he was going under the pseudonym ' Robert Hamton ' in order to fool audiences into thinking that the film was an American picture . The film does take obvious influence from the American monster movies and is similar in style , plot and execution ; and actually credit does have to go to Freda in that respect as if it wasn't for the awful dubbing , one would have no reason to think that this wasn't an American film . The plot is rather well worked and focuses on the demise of the Mayan civilisation . We focus on a team of archaeologists studying some ancient Mayan ruins when they come across a cave which houses a lake . After diving into the lake , they discover that it is full of gold ; although things go a bit awry when they also find out that the lake is inhabited by an ancient blob-like monster . They end up taking part of the creature back to the lab where upon studying it , they realise it could threaten the whole world . . . It was unveiled that many of the films which Riccardo Freda took credit for were actually directed by his young apprentice , Mario Bava - and Caltiki is one of those films . I have no idea how much of the film was directed by Bava , but I'd hesitantly say that I think it was mostly done by Freda as the film does not feature much in the way of Bava's trademark styling's ; although in truth the filming style is all very by the numbers and there's not a lot of room for stylish visuals . The plot is well done , however , and is certainly more inventive than I thought it might be . The special effects are not particularly spectacular ; though they certainly are serviceable for the type of film and are used well . There are a handful of good ideas on display - the fate that awaits a particularly greedy archaeologist being one of the best parts of it . The film tries to a bit spectacular towards the end , and it does work somewhat , although many of the American pictures did the spectacular ending better . Still , this is a decent little monster movie and I'm sure fans of this stuff will enjoy it .
422219	2248099	65481	7.0	Entertaining enough , but lacking .	Bonnie and Clyde was a big hit in 1967 , and I don't doubt that Hollywood's great money-spinner , Roger Corman , had that on his mind when he decided to direct a film based on another of America's great crime legends . The story of " Machine Gun Totting Ma Barker " is a well known one ; I won't profess to know the ins and outs of it , but the basics are common knowledge . The film would only appear to be loosely based on the classic story , however , and Corman seemed keener to put the focus on the situation within the group rather than actually telling a story . The plot focuses on Ma Barker ; a strong matriarch with four sons . The story takes place within depression era USA and Ma and her sons find themselves with little to live on and so turn to crime . The troupe carries out robberies , commits murder and does other such illegal acts and it soon gets dubbed as a ' crime spree ' . However , more interesting than that is how the group itself works ; perversion is rife as we get to witness things such as incest and homosexuality within the group . The film is rather entertaining throughout , but for me ; something about it just doesn't work . Corman's directing style is very cold and despite excellent performances from the cast - the film fails to be involving and nobody really steps up to take the ' antihero ' role effectively . It's a good job , therefore , that the film is entertaining for most of the duration as there isn't much in the way of distraction when it comes to the less entertaining parts . Corman has got himself together a good cast of actors ; chief among them obviously being Shelly Winters . Winters looks decidedly less glamorous than in previous performances - but fits into her role here very well indeed and really convincing that she is the character she is portraying . The rest of the cast is fine too , featuring good performances from the likes of Don Stroud and Bruce Dern , as well an early performance from the great Robert DeNiro . There's not a great deal of highlights in the film ; but Pat Hingle's role is entertaining and it all boils down to a very well working final shootout scene . Overall , this is decent enough ; but I'm not surprised that it hasn't gone down as a great film and would only recommend it to those who happen across a copy .
422736	2248099	454848	7.0	Would have been better if it wasn't so ' clever ' . . .	It's all too obvious that Inside Man is meant to be a lot more clever than it actually is ; director Spike Lee peppers his film with a light sprinkling of comments on race and society , but not many of them hold any weight and by the time the film ends , it's difficult to work out just what Lee is actually trying to say . Films that try to be intelligent and fail usually receive low ratings from me , but this one manages to claw some points back because it is entertaining , and the central bank robbery plot line is intricately handled with care and panache . It's a shame that Lee decided to try and make more of this than was necessary . I realise that a great deal of undemanding bank robbery films have already been made ; but this one could have been one of the best if the director had stuck to the strongpoints . The plot has two sides to it as we follow a bank robbery from inside the bank and out . Dalton is a smart bank robber who figures out a way to both rob a bank and bamboozle the police at the same time . Denzel Washington is the cop on the case , while the plot is given a third dimension from a scheming power broker . One of the principle problems with this film is that too much is made of it , and the plot sometimes doesn't come together very well as Lee analyses his plot from both a past and present perspective . This means that we have the police interviewing suspects at the same time as the robbery is going on , and this usually involves cutting back to the bank and seeing someone doing something memorable , before Denzel Washington and his partner try to crack the people they think could be responsible . It gets a bit repetitive too often , but there's usually just about enough going on to make the film interesting . The acting is good , with the wooden Clive Owen getting a role that suits him as the masked bank robber ; while the charismatic Denzel Washington provides more interest as the copper . Willem Dafoe doesn't make much of an impression , however , and Jodie Foster could have been better used . Scenes such as the one that sees a kid talking to Clive Owen about a video game involving some rapper are painful and unnecessary , however . The heist plot is well worked out , though , and seeing the plan come together at the end is the film's biggest highlight . Overall , I can't say I didn't enjoy this film as its entertaining and well worked ; but it's not the great film that the director obviously wanted it to be .
423514	2248099	65693	7.0	Over the top and ridiculous Italian trash classic !	Adrian Luther Smith , writer of the ' Giallo Bible ' Blood and Black Lace describes this film as a " trash masterpiece " - and I pretty much agree with him ! The film is sometimes labelled as a Giallo , although for me it fits more into the exploitation genre as although there is some murder mystery , it's clear that director Sergio Bergonzelli was much keen on delivering as much sleaze as possible ! The director also ensures that the film feels rather arty , and this makes In the Folds of Flesh even more of a gem , as the locations offset the frankly ridiculous story brilliantly ! The plot is overly convoluted ( to say the least ) , and focuses on the residents of an old castle . An escaped convict witnesses a woman burying her husband by a statue in the back garden . We then move to thirteen years later . A couple of unwelcome visitors stop by and are promptly killed by two of the younger castle residents . Then the escaped convict turns up and begins demanding money to stop him going to the police and reporting the body in the garden . . . another murder and a police investigation ensue . The film can be described as a hodgepodge of popular Italian exports . We've got a light Giallo tone , as well as an exploitation theme ; and then there are also mentions of Nazi's and ancient skeletons . Naturally , all the women are very nice to look at ; and while the acting from Eleonora Rossi Drago and Pier Angeli isn't great ; it hardly matters as they deliver the performances required of them . The best thing about this film is the way that Sergio Bergonzelli constantly chucks in another twist to make the already questionable plot more ridiculous at every opportunity . The film is also rather nasty , and features a whole host of gruesome morsels - including the aforementioned murders , an acid bath and a plethora of decapitations ! ( The director obviously loves them . . . ) . It has to be said that In the Folds of Flesh falls down in some areas - there's no sex or nudity , and by the time you get to the end ; it all feels rather pointless as it's impossible to care about the fates of any of the characters . Still , this is certainly a film worth seeing and I don't regret wasting ninety minutes of my life on it !
423387	2248099	53219	7.0	The fly returns , this time on a budget	Obviously , this sequel is nowhere near as good as the original 1958 film ' The Fly ' , but despite obviously being a cheap follow-up and working from a story that basically just rips off the first film , there are some good ideas here and the film is definitely worth watching . The only actor to return from the original movie is Vincent Price , but the story does lead directly on as in true horror sequel style , in this film we follow the fortunes of the original scientist's son , who naturally decides to follow on his father's experiments . Price isn't the only thing that was recycled for this film , however , as the film was apparently written to incorporate sets from the original , although this does make sense considering how the story follows on . The hapless scientist this time is Philippe Delambre , son of Andre Delambre , and a man who has decided to rebuild the transportation device . Along with his friend Alan Hinds and uncle Francois Delambre , they conduct a series of experiments in the hope of succeeding where Andre failed . . . but naturally , as nothing runs smoothly in a horror film , events take a turn for the macabre . . . I'm guessing that black and white film was cheap around 1959 as despite the fact that the original film was shot in colour , this one is in black and white . However , I actually prefer films like this in black and white , so this wasn't a problem for me . Vincent Price took a backseat in the original film , but as his star was rising by the release of this follow-up ; he gets a more central role , although he still doesn't appear enough if you ask me . His role here isn't one of his strongest , but anything that features a performance from the great Mr Price is well worth seeing if you ask me . It has to be said that most of the performances ( and dialogue ) in this film are pretty ridiculous , but among the rest of the cast Brett Halsey , an actor who would go on to make Italian films along with this likes of Mario Bava and Lucio Fulci , stands out as the unlucky scientist . The film obviously isn't very graphic ; although it's slightly more violent than the first film , and the transporter machine is put to much better use here . The special effects are inventive too , and work well despite obviously not costing much . Overall , this is at least a worthy follow-up , which while not as great as the original ; has its moments and is worth seeing .
423456	2248099	91671	7.0	Definitely one of the best horror omnibus films	Horror omnibuses have been around in one way or another pretty much since the great Mario Bava rejuvenated them in 1963 with the awesome Black Sabbath . They often vary in quality , and many are brought down by weak links ; this one , however , doesn't suffer from any weak stories . Obviously , some are better than others ; but all in all , I don't hesitate to call this one of the best horror omnibuses that I've seen . From a Whisper to a Scream is most notable for the fact that it is Vincent Price's last ever ' pure ' horror movie . It's a shame to see the great master during his swansong to the genre that made him ; but on the other hand , this role really shows Price's talent as , despite being only a small part , he really makes the best of it . The plot concerns a small town called Oldfield . After the electrocution of his niece , librarian Julian White ( Price ) tells a reporter about the horrible incidents that have occurred in the town . The first tale is the weakest of the bunch - but it still has it's moments . Clu Gulager is creepy throughout , and the themes that it handles are quite frightening . Speaking of frightening - check out that tale's climax ! Anyway , tale one is just a warm up , really . . . Tale two is the highlight for yours truly . I love it when an omnibus flick produces a tale worth remembering - and this tale certainly is ! It works from more than just visual horror , and when you think about the potency of the ending - this one really hits home . Nice message , too . Not far behind in terms of quality is tale three . This is the typical eighties story of the bunch , and a lot of the reason it works is courtesy of the gruesome special effects . This one also generates intrigue from it's story , however , and cant be seen as merely an excuse to show some blood and guts . The last tale of the quartet is the most psychological of the bunch , and it follows the fortunes of three civil war soldiers that are ' kidnapped ' by a bunch of children ! This one went on a little bit too long for my liking , but the ideas behind it are good and the way that we see the soldiers being dominated by the evil children is quite surreal . It's obvious that writer-director respects the fact that he's managed to get one of the all-time greatest horror actors in the film by the way that the wraparound story is handled . Usually , this part of the film lets it down because it hasn't been very well thought out - but the one in this film is completely the opposite and actually makes the movie ! On the whole , this isn't a must see horror movie , but it's very good and I highly recommend it !
423508	2248099	397065	7.0	It's a remake . . . and it's GOOD !	This film is never as great as the Vincent Price version - but it doesn't actually matter , as aside from sharing the same title - the two are hardly the same film . To be honest , I don't know why the makers couldn't just use a different title ( something like ' Nightmare in Wax ' or ' The House of Melted Candlesticks ' wouldn't have been bad ? ) - this would have made sure that the film is instantly going to be taken more seriously than most remakes ( as it would , in fact , be an ' original ' film ) and it would shut people like me who always moan about remakes , up . I see this film more as your classic madman slasher with something of a disturbing twist involving wax . The original film worked more from its creepy elements and the idea of wax figures mimicking people - this film is a heavy rock-laden excuse to pick off a few teens . And to be honest , I liked it a lot . The plot follows a group of ( mostly ) good looking young people that drive across the country to see ' the game ' . While on their way , they make an ill-fated stop in a field , and end up coming across a deserted little town . . . with a rather strange ' House of Wax ' . . . The gore is surprisingly more brutal than you would expect it to be . Mass releases tend to hold back with the gore - but this one seems happy to go all out for shocks - and scenes that see pipes go through heads , mouths glued together , decapitations and more show this aptly . House of Wax is slow to start , and the bits leading up to the gore are made up of lame ' character building ' and various banter . . . but it's never boring , and once the gore does start - the film really takes off . The best part of the film for me was definitely the ending , however - which is impressive , creepy and very apt all in one ! The acting definitely leaves a lot to be desired - but the central characters , played by Elisha Cuthbert and Chad Michael Murray - are well done . Paris Hilton is responsible for a lot of the flack that the film receives - and for good reason . She may have a lot of money , but she isn't good looking and she certainly can't act . Anyway , Hilton aside - this is really a lot better than you would expect a remake of a classic Vincent Price film to be . As mentioned , it's more of a slasher than anything else ; but unlike most films of its ilk , this is actually a good one . Recommended .
421748	2248099	117998	7.0	Could have been good	Twister was almost universally slammed upon it's release in 1996 . Jan De Bont came hot off the heels of a great success with ' Speed ' , but unfortunately he couldn't make it two hits in a row . It is a shame , because Twister features lots of brilliantly thrilling action set pieces . The tornado ( ' Tornado ' wasn't as striking a title as ' Twister ' ) is one of nature's most extreme expressions of itself , and the scenes with the humans battling against it really do get the adrenaline running . Cows and ' debris ' , which consists of things such as Combine Harvesters , Petrol trucks , and my personal favourite ; an entire house , which our hero's must drive straight through to get to safety , zip past the screen and cause our hero's all manner of trouble . This film has no problem with it's action side , so why doesn't it quite feel right ? It's not a problem with casting , as this movie features a fairly good cast . My favourite actor , Bill Paxton heads it . Bill doesn't put in one of his best performances in this movie . . . actually , some parts are painful to watch , but Bill is definitely a talent and he makes the movie worth seeing . ( He was my main reason for seeing it ) . Starring opposite Paxton is Helen Hunt . Helen would prove that she could act a year after this movie with the brilliant ; " As Good as it Gets " in 1997 , and she gives a decent performance here as the typical woman ; bitchy , controlling but ultimately lovable . The Dread Pirate Roberts is the villain of the piece , but he doesn't really get a lot of screentime and to be honest , I don't rate him anyway . Jami Gertz is equally unimpressive as Bill's prissy , yet uncharismatic girlfriend ; but those two are made up for by Phillip Seymour Hoffman , who , despite having an extremely irritating character to work with , puts in a great little turn and steals nearly every scene he's in . So it's not a problem with the casting , so what's the problem ? The human drama is the problem . Frankly , it's laughable . It isn't helped at all by a lacklustre script , which is cringe-worthy at times , but it's not even the script that really makes it falter ; it's the complete lack of feeling for any of the characters . Of course , the tornado's are the real star of the show , but if you're going to include a human element ; you have to at least make it work . The story behind the twisters is that Bill and Helen are married , but awaiting a divorce . Bill has found another woman in the form of Jami Gertz , and wants Helen to sign the divorce papers so he can remarry . However , life is never that simple and Bill and Helen are actually still in love ; a love rekindled by a mutual love for the weather condition of the title , of course . The chemistry between these characters is non-existent and it really spoils the movie . I recognise the fact that you can't have a movie without a human element for the audience to relate to ; but the one here is terrible . Just . . . awful . So , do I recommend Twister ? Yes , it's action sequences are fantastic and the film is , therefore , well worth 2 hours of anyone's time for those sequences alone . The movie is definitely good entertainment , but it would have been a lot better with a decent script and characters that you can feel for .
421872	2248099	71662	7.0	A little more depth than the average Italian sex comedy	Director Massimo Dallamano is undoubtedly best known among cult film fans for his excellent Giallo ' What Have They Done to Solange ' and considering the brilliance of that film , it would seem on first glance that he made this little sex comedy merely as an excuse to work with the beautiful and talented Edwige Fenech . While that may well be true ( and who could possibly blame him ? ) , this film is actually a little more than merely a vehicle for the stunning actress and has some hidden depths beneath its often goofy exterior . The film focuses on a young man named Tonino Niscemi . He wants to pursue a career as a priest and as such has never had sex with a woman , nor does he have any desire to . However , upon returning home to his father ( who supports his son in becoming a priest ) and his grandfather ( who does not ) , Tonino finds himself at odds after meeting his father's new wife Carmela ; a teasing wench who keeps him fawning after her . The film is billed as a sex comedy ; and indeed several antics reinforce that fact ( mostly stemming from the randy grandfather ) but much of the film undertakes a serious tone and its clear that the director was keen to explore the sexual awakening of his central character ; and it is that which gives the film most of its depth . It has to be said that Roberto Cenci does not exactly cut a likable figure in the central role ; he looks a bit too ' green ' for my liking and is often unconvincing in the role . This , however , is made up for by the presence of Edwige Fenech who despite not giving her best performance provides a regular distraction whether clothed , unclothed or somewhere between the two . Edwige is at her sultry best while teasing her co-star , as happens often . There's more than enough to keep the proceedings interesting and the side show of over the top characters helps to ensure that . The ending can be seen coming a mile away and provides no surprises ; but it wraps things up nicely and while this isn't a ' great ' film by any stretch of the imagination , it's certainly well worth a look for Edwige Fenech fans or collectors of Italian sex comedies .
422996	2248099	79082	7.0	A hit for Abel Ferrara	It has been said of Abel Ferrara that you will either be turned on by his artistic vision , or be left cold by it . I'm split down the middle when it come to his films , I've liked half the ones I've seen but disliked the other half ; this one fits firmly in the ' like ' side of the equation . The Driller Killer is another entry into the ' shock ' cinema repertoire , which is topped by such classics as The Last House on the Left and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre . The Driller Killer hasn't gained itself as much fame or notoriety as those two , but don't let that fool you ; it is still a very good movie . The story follows an artist , who , through the pressures of his work and various things going on around him , is slowly driven insane . His insanity is brought about by lack of money and a punk rock band that has moved in upstairs . We are able to see the frustrations of our ' hero ' increase throughout the movie , especially when the plot thickens and several other things in his life go awry . Because of this , we can see that there is a reason for the brutality that is later shown in the film , and therefore this movie can take credit for having a story behind it's violence , and not just having brutality for the sake of it . The Driller Killer was originally banned as a " video nasty " because of the notoriety it gained for it's cover art , as opposed to it's content . This can be seen clearly by the fact that The Driller Killer isn't actually that gory . Of course , as the title suggests ; this film features a drill being inserted into various places on the human anatomy ; but unlike a lot of other movies of this ilk , the horror doesn't come as a result of the huge amounts of gore spurting from the wounds , but rather from the noise that the drill makes while being used , and the insanity of the main character . However , gorehounds will still find lots to like about this movie and the people without a strong stomach are probably best staying clear . Overall , the Driller Killer is a creative and inventive insight into insanity . It's not a masterpiece like some movies that deal with a similar theme , such as Taxi Driver , but it a very good movie and recommended to fans of shock cinema .
423550	2248099	55864	7.0	Completely bizarre cult oddity !	If it's a completely bizarre horror flick you're after , then you can go wrong with Confessions of an Opium Eater as there is NOTHING typical about this flick , and overall it is just as much an oddity as its title suggests it is ! I actually saw this film under the alternative title ' Souls for Sale ' , but ' Confessions of an Opium Eater ' does the film far more justice . My main reason for seeing the film was because it's a Vincent Price film that I'd never come across before , and anyone seeing Confessions of an Opium Eater for the same reason won't be disappointed as this is Vincent Price as you've never seen him ! Indeed , not even the usually distinctive master of the macabre can deliver the usual in this film . The plot is often confusing and doesn't always flow well , but the themes of opium induced hallucinations , Chinese human auctions and odd little midgets are usually enough to see it through and ensure that it's hard to care about the shortcomings with the plot . The dialogue is surprisingly lyrical , and it's a huge benefit to the film that Vincent Price is on hand to deliver it . Price's voice always bodes well with dialogue like this , and that doesn't change here . Confessions of an Opium Eater was filmed in black and white , and while the cinematography looks rather cheap ; it does fit the feel of the film . Vincent Price takes centre stage at almost all times , and while there are some memorable characters among the supporting cast - it is always clear that this is Price's film . The film is directed by Albert Zugsmith ; and the fact that he is better known for his producing credits is hardly surprising as his direction isn't exactly inspiring . . . but then again , you can't expect brilliance in a B-movie picture like this one . There are a number of standout moments in the film , however , and chief among them is Price's hallucination sequence ; which somehow manages to blend well with the rest of the picture . Overall , Confessions of an Opium Eater is a film that is well worth tracking down despite not being one of price's out and out best efforts , and I highly recommend it .
422466	2248099	110265	7.0	Surprisingly decent , actually	Killing Zoe is the feature film debut from Quentin Tarantino's ex-friend and collaborator on Pulp Fiction , Roger Avery . Avery is less talented than his ex-friend , that's beyond question and it shows in this movie ; which despite not being bad at all , isn't brilliant either . The first thing you'll notice about it is it's European styling , which emancipates from the fact that it's set in Paris and it's cast of actors , who hail from across Europe ( and the world ) . We've got French , British , Japanese and most probably more . The plot is Reservoir Dogs-ish , with a bunch of men planning a bank heist . We follow Zed ( Erik Stoltz ) , an American that has just arrived in Paris and hooked himself with a hooker . He's in on the robbery of course , but before he gets there he's taken on a night out around Paris , for drugs , drinking and god only knows what else . Naturally , the film is cool as anything ; and this appears to be the entire point of the movie as the plot lacks bite , charm or anything resembling a point . Killing Zoe gains credibility for being very entertaining , and you'll wonder where the time has gone while watching this movie , which is never a bad thing . Of course , it is , in effect , a waste of time ; but if you enjoy watching it , it hardly matters . The film is continually unpleasant , with violence , gore , swearing , nudity and the rest of the gang featuring heavily , which will no doubt offend some - but certainly not me . Eric Stoltz takes the lead role , and does well with it ; even if he does never really impress , and at times even looks uncomfortable . Julie Delpy is the title character and she doesn't impress either ; she'd prove her worth a year later in Before Sunrise , of course , but here she doesn't really impress . Jean-Hugues Anglade , who does impress as the lead villain , steals the show . He's loud , brash and over the top ; making every scene he's in a delight . Avery's direction is solid for most of the movie , but he appears to get a little big headed towards the end when he throws in lots of little tricks that aren't all that good . However , this is certainly a decent movie and fans of Tarantino will probably think " it's awesome ! "
422798	2248099	734654	8.0	Perfection isn't always perfect	The Lateness of the Hour represents another sterling success for The Twilight Zone ! The plot idea behind this episode has been used many times since , and it follows the idea of perfection . We are acquainted with a family ; mother , father , daughter and servants . However , the daughter has become bored with their existence . The family lives in the perfect environment , with no contact with the outside world ; and she craves more . More than what her parents and the servants can give her ? The brains of this tale make up its backbone . I love the way that the writers can take twenty five minute of screen time and give you a tale that makes you think more than most feature films do ! The way that the story takes place in what seems like a whole other world ensures that it very much feels like a part of The Twilight Zone . All the trademarks of the show ; from the over the top music score , to Rod Serling making an appearance to add in important plot details every now again feature , and I've got to say that this is one of the most ingenious episodes of the classic TV show that I've seen yet ! Highly recommended like all the other episodes .
423888	2248099	47849	8.0	Excellent paranoid western	Based on a story by Howard Breslin , Bad Day at Black Rock is a story of paranoia , patriotism , secrets and justice in a small town . This story and others like it have been seen time and time again in cinema , but this one stands apart for it's great acting as well as the intricacies of the story . This film got off to a bit of a bad start with me , as I was expecting ( and hoping for ) a black and white picture , but it turns out that this film was filmed in Eastmancolor , which is a bit like Technicolor . Despite the fact that my favourite movie of all time ( The Good , The Bad and The Ugly ) is filmed in Technicolor ; I generally prefer classic westerns , especially pre-60's ones to be filmed in black and white . . . it just looks better . Anyway , the plot follows a one-armed ex-army man named Macreedy , who gets off a train at a small town as he has a medal for the father of the man who saved his life in world war 2 . The man gets more than he bargained for , however , when he stumbles upon the fact that this is a town with a secret . . . and it's one that they will withhold by any means necessary . . . Director John Sturges is quite a name within the western genre , having directed films such as Joe Kidd and , of course , The Magnificent Seven . Bad Day at Black Rock is a completely different kettle of fish from those two , however , as it's far more story based ; and substitutes the gun slinging that westerns are famous for , for more talking and story building . I would liken this film to the classic ' The Ox-Bow Incident ' before comparing it with the directors ' other films . Sturges directs his cast excellently , and it's their performances that bring out the best in the film . Spencer Tracy leads the ensemble with a great performance that really holds the movie together . There aren't too many big names here , but those belonging to Lee Marvin and Ernest Borgnine stand out . The story is one of those that has implications beyond the immediate goings on , and it's also one that will be relevant throughout history as it keeps repeating itself . Overall , this is a very good western-drama that is sure to please anyone with a mind to seek it out . Recommended .
421968	2248099	91142	8.0	Visually stunning hypnotic nightmare !	Despite it's uninspiring title , Ken Russell's " Gothic " is actually an intriguing , and uniquely inspiring piece of cinema . Mary Shelly's " Frankenstein " is one of the stories that has helped to shape horror cinema , and so the story behind it is guaranteed to interest horror fans . This film isn't exactly the story of how the story came to fruition ; but rather a compilation of ideas surrounding " what could have happened " ( but quite clearly didn't ) . The film takes influence from the enigmatic Lord Byron more than anything , and it's always him that springs to mind as we watch the small cast delve into their imaginations , culminating in an orgy of sex and violence . The story is simple , and focuses more on imagery and the ideas behind what is happening on screen . We follow Percy Shelly and his wife to be , Mary ; along with her sister Claire , who travel to the self-exiled home of Lord Byron . While there , the four of them ; along with Byron's biographer , decide to indulge in the art of making up ghost stories . However , the fun gets out of hand when the quintet begins to believe that they have actually created a monster . The film has a very ' intellectual ' flavour , but the fact is that there isn't a lot below the surface of this film . Gothic , to me at least , is a visual treat rather than food for thought - with Ken Russell's imagery providing more than any deep and complex substance . The imagery is stunning , and fits into the film very well . Russell's sets compliment the story excellently , and the atmosphere in which the film takes place is more important than the story itself . Lord Byron's house is almost a character within itself , and when combined with the actual characters ; Russell has provided horror fans with a very surreal film indeed . The cast is excellent . Films with a small cast rely more on their actors , and this film certainly doesn't fall down in that respect . Gabriel Byrne leads the cast , and does an excellent job of holding the film together . Julian Sands , Natasha Richardson , Myriam Cyr and Timothy Spall , who all portray their characters excellently , join him . On the whole ; I can easily see why people dislike this film ; as it's somewhat messy , and doesn't adhere to common horror standards - but if you like your horror different , this is highly recommended .
423474	2248099	74083	8.0	As over the top as an Italian rip-off can be !	Italian filmmakers are famous for ripping off successful American films ; but with this film director Alberto De Martino has taken it to a whole new level ; as he's collected just about everything that made films such as Dirty Harry successful and mashed it all together in this action packed and over the top cop flick . Most of the Italian Polizi flicks have things that were clearly taken from American films ; but usually they retain a sense of the Italian style . This is not the case here ; the film is Italian , but you can actually believe that it's an American film , and it was clearly made to appeal to American audience . As the title suggests , the film focuses on Tony Saitta ; the type of hard nosed cop that will punch you in the face and smash your car up before even thinking about asking any questions . The plot kicks off properly when Saitta's sister ( who is a good twenty years his junior ) dies in mysterious circumstances . The cop then sets out to find out who did it ; by forsaking the usual police methods . After following the clues . . . he eventually gets close to the killer . Despite taking influence from such great films , this one is a long way from being brilliant itself ; but it is at least great fun . The way that the central characters jumps in with both feet at every opportunity is great , and seeing him brutalise suspects at the drop of a hat does ensures that the film doesn't become boring on many occasions . Alberto De Martino is backed up by a good cast ; with Stuart Whitman in the lead role and receiving good support from cult star John Saxon as well as the A-lister Martin Landau . This film is not very seen ; but anyone who does see it will undoubtedly remember the car chase , which is peppered with clichés but is at least really well done ; not least for the fact that it all comes off as the result of a minor piece of plot development ! The film also borrows from other genres ; with the Giallo genre creeping in during some scenes . It soon becomes clear that the film is not going to deliver anything meaningful by the ending but the climax does at least wrap things up nicely and while this is not a great film on the whole ; it is lots of fun and well worth a look .
422233	2248099	39305	8.0	Classic example of film noir	This slice of film noir isn't one of the better known ones , and the reason for that is probably because it doesn't have any real stand out elements about it ; but the film does work excellently as a textbook example of the style of film-making . The most notable thing about the film is the fact that it features a leading performance from the great Humphrey Bogart . Bogart's personality has always been more than a little bit over the top , but it often isn't too noticeable . For some reason , however , it really sticks out in this film ; but it somehow fits the dialogue like a glove , and the feel of this film is very much in the true classic style of noir . The plot is pretty standard , and follows Bogart's character ; an ex-paratrooper , who is looking for a friend of his that disappeared after being accused of murder . However , he gets more than he bargained for when he hooks up with his friend's mistress , ' Dusty ' Chandler . The atmosphere of the movie is dark and mysterious , and this blends brilliantly with the brooding plot line . The film manages to pull in many of the standard noir elements ; best of which is the femme fatale ; excellently brought to life by Lizabeth Scott . Overall , Dead Reckoning is a very good example of the film noir style of film-making , and while it's not one of the ' must see ' films ; it's certainly well worth bothering with .
423049	2248099	240890	8.0	Nice little comedy that could have been better	This sweet romance is predictable and hinges on a rather unlikely scenario . I mean , if you'd just met someone that may well be your soul mate ; would you really let them go and leave it up to fate to bring you back together ? No , me neither ; but Kate Beckinsale and John Cusack decide to do just that and that's the springboard for this romantic comedy . However , to it's credit ; it does work and , for a change , here we have a romantic comedy with a definite point . Obviously it deals with fate ; but there are also elements of finding the right person and not being able to be happy with someone you know isn't that person . It's true that the film could have been a lot better , as on the whole it's rather poorly handled and spends too much time being sweet or trying to be funny , and not enough is spent on building up the characters so that we'll care for them enough for it to be effective ; but still , the film is a lot of fun and it's a damn sight more interesting than the vast majority of films in it's class . John Cusack is an actor that I rate . I don't think he's made anything poignantly brilliant at this time , but for many of his films ; he's the best thing in it . That is a comment towards the quality of many of his films , but also towards his talent as an actor , as I feel he has the ability to hold an audience's attention and deliver a fine performance while doing so . The beautiful Kate Beckinsale joins him . Kate isn't a brilliant actress , as she shows in this film , but she is absolutely beautiful and she and Cusack make a nice couple together on screen . However , due the plot ; they don't get to spend a lot of the running time together , with only one brief , if nice , spurt . The film is dogged by the usual romantic comedy hindrances , such as unlikely situations and a soundtrack of pre-recorded songs when a score would have worked much better ; but the film is a good time and seeing the two's lives intertwine while not actually meeting is a quirky , and somewhat genius . As I said , this could and by all accounts should have been better . Still , it is what it is and it is good escapism .
423407	2248099	342258	8.0	Surprisingly good , and one of the best films of 2005	The best martial arts films are always the ones that deliver the fight sequences along with an interesting story and characters , and that is exactly what Unleashed does . The fighting and the story exist in equal parts , and the film never feels like its delivering one side over another . The plotting , therefore , is extremely well done ; as the graceful action sequences deliver the adrenaline , while the story exists to give point to the movie and keep the viewer interested . The fact that the action sequences are some of the best I've seen from recent cinema doesn't hinder the film at all ; Jet Li's kicks , punches and head butts are all perfectly timed and realistically done - there's no over the top slow motion or gravity defying leaps here , and because of that ; massive credit has to go to the choreographers . The plot follows a loan shark named Bart , who keeps a man locked up in his basement . The man in his basement is a trained killer , and once the loan shark removes his collar ; woe betides anyone who gets on his wrong side . This life is all the collared man knows ; but when , by chance , he meets a blind piano tuner . . . he gets shown a new life , one that he never knew existed . Unleashed benefits from a trio of excellent performances . Bob Hoskins stands out most as the inherently evil Bart ; trainer and master . Bob Hoskins is a great actor who can deliver a range of emotions - but he's at his best when he gets to ham it up as the villain ! Morgan Freeman , whose intrinsically good Sam plays against Hoskins ' baddie , offsets his performance . These two characters represent two sides of the spectrum ; namely , good and evil , leaving Jet Li's character , Danny , in the middle - drawn to the good , yet constantly pulled towards the bad . Li's role doesn't require a great deal of acting ability , but Jet makes the best of his more emotional moments . His real role in this movie , however , is in the fighting sequences ; in which he is excellent . This man is the closest thing we have to Bruce Lee these days ; and he shows why here . The sequences themselves are typically violent , and every time there's a hint of a fight about to start ; it draws you towards the edge of your seat . The pivotal sequence , involving Jet Li fighting four opponents in a pit is a contender for the most exciting scene of the year . The ending is more than satisfying , and all characters are made to flourish in a way that is congruent with their roles in the film . On the whole ; this is a great little flick , and well worth seeing !
422905	2248099	47976	8.0	Obscure atmospheric horror gem !	Dementia is one weird film ! To sum it up in a nutshell , I'd say it's kind of like a longer and somewhat more macabre version of The Twilight Zone ! The film doesn't include any graphic scenes - although this didn't stop Dementia being banned upon its release in 1955 . The film creates it's horror through atmosphere rather than violence , and the result is rather effective . It has to be said that the narration courtesy of Ed McMahon is more than a little bit cheesy - some have even compared the film to the ' works ' of Ed Wood in that respect ( I personally wouldn't go that far ) - but his voice-over does have a horrific vibe to it , and it certainly benefits the film . Dementia is not exactly plot heavy , and we simply focus on a woman whom we are told is insane . We then follow this woman throughout the night as she gets involved in a series of activities - things such as encounters with various unsavoury characters and other happenings on the dark streets . The film contains no dialogue , and the only speaking part belongs to the narrator . This sets the film apart on it's own as very few films work in this way , and that only adds to its originality . The film achieves it's genuinely unsettling atmosphere via the way that every single character in the film is completely loathsome . It's not hard to see why this film offended the censors back in 1995 . There are a few macabre scenes , though most of the violence is implied rather than shown , and this serves Dementia rather well . The film is very surreal , and a lot of it feels like a nightmare - which is definitely to the film's credit . Watching the central character drift through John Parker's nightmarish dreamscape is entirely captivating , and this is of huge benefit to the film as it completely relies on this in order to succeed . Dementia is unlikely to appeal to everyone due to its frankly odd nature , but it's definitely a film worth seeing . Atmosphere is important in horror films , and this one is PURE atmosphere - highly recommended viewing !
423949	2248099	74226	8.0	Oddball seventies horror , and a rare success for Jeff Lieberman	I've learned not to go into Jeff Lieberman's films with high expectations , as although I liked his latest film ; horror-comedy ' Satan's Little Helper ' , both Squirm and Just Before Dawn did nothing for me , despite high expectations before seeing them . However , Blue Sunshine is surely the director's best film , as it works on both a visceral and psychological level . The film is something of a crossover between the zombie horror subgenre , and a drug fuelled mystery plot . The most effective side of the film , horror-wise , is definitely the idea of silly choices you made as a kid coming back to haunt you as an adult . The plot focuses on a batch of drugs called ' Blue Sunshine ' , which was distributed around a certain college ten years ago . Now the drug is coming back to haunt the users by way of hair-loss , headaches , nightmares and an insatiable desire to kill people . We follow Jerry Zipkin , a young man that ends up at the centre of the trouble and decides to get the bottom of the mystery , which centres on a politician trying to get elected by way of a publicity drive . I suppose the main reason why I'm not Jeff Lieberman's biggest fan is because his films often lack bite and don't move swiftly enough . This one is no different on that front , except this time ; instead of merely focusing on a bunch of worms , or yet another troupe of deformed , deranged backwoods killers ; Lieberman has the advantage of an intriguing mystery to base his film on . While it's always obvious where it's going , the director manages to get the audience to care about what's going to happen , and as drugs and their effects are intriguing subjects anyway ; there's always enough to keep things ticking over . Lieberman also injects sequences that see various characters lose their hair before trying to kill anyone and everyone in the vicinity , and these too make the final package more intriguing - the sequence that sees a nanny take out her lust for violence out on a couple of irritating kids being the highlight in that respect . Overall , it has to be said that the film isn't perfect - not everything is perfectly judged , and it could have been streamlined better . Furthermore , it ends prematurely and feels a bit lazy ; but even so , Blue Sunshine is an excellent little flick and comes highly recommended .
422468	2248099	83722	8.0	Tourneur's masterpiece gets a sleazy makeover	Let's face it ; this remake of Jacques Tourneur's 1942 masterpiece was doomed from the start . This is the sort of film that people will go into with zero expectations because of the brilliance of the original and dislike it because of the huge chasm of quality between this and Tourneur's film . However , in spite of the fact that this remake isn't nearly as good ; it still stands alone as a more than decent eighties horror flick . The thick and foreboding atmosphere of the original has been replaced by a more sleazy , erotic tone and the film is much more keen to focus on themes of lust and incest than the folklore behind the affliction of the central character , which the original portrayed so well . This offers a different take on the ' Cat People ' theme , and while it never works as well as the tone in the original ; it's still rather nice , and on a personal note ; I just love sleazy films ! Not to mention the fact that a frame for frame remake is never a good idea . The film features a number of corny moments , and the gore and nudity go over the top on several occasions , which won't go down well with many fans of the original , but it isn't a bad thing , as all these things add to the kitschy element of the film and all aid the sleaze , and are , therefore , more than welcome in my opinion . The theme of incest is capitalised upon , and director Paul Schrader doesn't seem all that bothered about making a film that crosses a boundary where taboos are concerned . Malcolm McDowell aids this film massively in this respect , and his performance in this movie is nothing short of fabulous . He's simultaneously malevolent and perverse , and every moment he's on screen is a highlight . The original worked by way of keeping the action simple , and ensuring the audience is always left guessing as to what's going to happen next . Schrader goes the other way with this movie , and he makes sure that we see EVERYTHING , and this is no bad thing in my book . The mystery is retained still , and Schrader manages to leave us on the edge of our seats . When it comes to movies featuring shape shifting , it's nearly always , if not always , werewolves that are the central focus ; so another thing I like about this film is that it offers a different animal for the characters to change into . It has no doubt taken influence from ' The Howling ' , with it's great little change sequence towards the end , and that marks one of the highlights of the movie . The movie is a little overlong , and the ending will leave many ( including yours truly ) cold , but on the whole , while this is disappointing because it's not as great as the original , it's still a damn fine horror film . And besides , at the end of the day ; how many films can you name that have reached the heights of the 1942 version of Cat People ?
423709	2248099	57076	8.0	Second only to Goldfinger !	To be honest , I'm not a massive fan of James Bond films . I do , however , tend to enjoy the ones starring Sean Connery ; and while it doesn't touch the masterpiece ' Goldfinger ' , From Russia With Love is definitely one of Bond's better adventures . It's also one of the few films that has managed to keep a solid reputation after it's release . While many of Bond's adventures are strictly cult flicks , or just not very well liked ; this one is often cited as great film by critics from all corners , and there's a reason for that . This is the Bond film that set the staples of the series , including the theme music and many of the regular characters . The story is typical of the sixties and fires James Bond straight into the thick of the Cold War . We follow the maverick secret agent as he attempts to foil a plot by the evil corporation S . P . E . C . T . R . E . to steal a Lektor ( Russian decoding device ) . As James Bond walks straight into their trap , he must thwart both their agents and the Russians , as the East faces the West a la the Cold War . My main problem with this plot is that it's not on a big enough scale . The only thing at stake is a decoding device which , while still not a bad prize , makes the film feel like a big song and dance for a very small payoff . Still , the plot is handled with great skill and while the film doesn't feature any stunts that rival some of the more recent Bond offerings ; the ones that do feature definitely work and succeed in getting the adrenaline flowing . The film is definitely a lot better as we get past the hour mark . The first hour features rather a lot of talking and not much action ; and while I don't really have a problem with this , most people tune into Bond flicks for smart wit and action sequences . The second hour makes up for the slow first , as we are treated to a climax that takes place on rail , road and water . Sean Connery is , without a doubt , the best man to ever play James Bond . His persona and mannerism fits the character brilliantly and , in my opinion , was never properly replaced . On the whole , this isn't as great as Goldfinger ; but it is a very good film . From Russia With Love is one of the few that will appeal to Bond and Non-Bond fans alike !
422630	2248099	100369	8.0	Much better than you would expect	Because it's a newer version of a classic horror movie ( and it went directly to video ) , I have been putting off watching Stuart Gordon's take on Edgar Allen Poe's classic story , but after finally catching it ; I can honestly say that I don't know why I didn't see it earlier ! While the Roger Corman / Vincent Price version of the tale is far better , this update still has a lot in store for the horror fan , most notably it's superb European styled atmosphere , and a fine performance by Lance Henriksen , which may even be the best of his career . While these elements are contributors to the film's success , the main reason why the film works is the story behind it . Of course , it's based ( albeit loosely ) on Poe's classic tale , so the story is bound to be solid ; but it doesn't take all of it's influence from Poe , and so Dennis Paoli can take a lot of credit for the screenplay he wrote for the movie . The idea of ' the pendulum ' , along with a ' pit ' can conjure up many feelings of dread and pain , and this film adequately capitalises on that with it's excellent torture filled finale ! As mentioned , Lance Henriksen gives what is maybe his best performance in this film . He is both powerful and frightening in his role as Torquemada , the head witchfinder of the Spanish Inquisition . When he says " I am the inquisition " , it's enough to make your hairs stand on end . Henriksen is a criminally underrated actor and one that certainly deserves more praise . . . it's just unfortunate that he tends to shine in movies that don't get noticed . Also in the cast is ' Re-Animator ' himself , Jeffrey Combs , who shines in a small role as someone in the inquisition . The film isn't wholly serious , and Stuart Gordon has seen fit to add some comic relief to the proceedings , which is OK but I feel that the movie would be better off without any ' relief ' . Certain elements from other Poe stories appear , such as a man being bricked in behind a wall , and this film seems to treat it's subject material with respect . The European horror style is a major plus factor in my opinion , and should please fans of movies from the sixties and seventies . On the whole ; surprisingly good !
422852	2248099	299977	8.0	One of the best films so far this decade	Some films are heavy on style and lack substance somewhat , other films have a lot of substance but lose out in the style department . Ying Xiong , however , doesn't lose out in either ; it is the perfect fusion of style and substance . The story of the film , is most definitely secondary to the amazing visuals and stunning direction , but it is not incidental ; the plot of the movie is also very important . The film is set in ancient China , which at that time was divided into seven kingdoms . The ruler of one of the kingdoms , Qin , has found himself under threat from assassins ; the three greatest of which are named Sky , Broken Sword and Falling Snow ; stupid names ? Indeed . When a young man claims to have defeated all three of these martial art masters , he is summoned to the palace in order to tell the king his story . The way that the plot pans out very much resembles the classic Japanese film , Rashômon ; in that several people end up giving their versions of events . The film switches back and fourth from past to present effortlessly , and manages to do it without being convoluted or confusing . The narrative of the film is very well structured in that way , and despite the relative complexity of the plot ; the film never becomes challenging for the viewer ; but that's not to say it isn't thought provoking either . If someone was to ask me what Ying Xiong was about , I would predominantly say sacrifice . All of the characters in the film sacrifice something , whether it be their love for another character , or their life for the cause that they believe in . Their actions are always explained , and nothing seems out of place or like it's happened by accident , which makes the story flow well and allows the film to be strong in the story department . The thing that will stick out in the viewer's mind once the credits role is without doubt the vibrant use of colour that Zhang Yimou delights in portraying . The fight scenes are spectacularly beautiful ; they're well choreographed and extremely aesthetically pleasing . I'm not a fan of the use of slow motion in fight sequences as it detracts attention away from the action , but Ying Xiong manages to use slow motion in a way that it ends up being of benefit to the movie . Most of the time it looks fake , and like the movie is trying to be overly arty ; but here it adds to the beauty . Ying Xiong is one a few films released so far this decade that is set to achieve classic status in years to come , and it demands that you see it , if only for that reason . This film is not one that you will want to miss .
422590	2248099	95801	8.0	Excellent character-lead drama	Films like this don't usually interest me , but it's hard not to be taken in by Bagdad Cafe's energy and brilliantly put together characters . This lushly shot film follows the fortunes of a family that runs a café in the middle of the desert , and their friends that live close by . The story really starts when German woman , Jasmin , has an argument with her husband and ends up staying at the motel owned by the café owners . It isn't long before she's interacting with the family , much to the dismay , at first , to the head of the family ; Brenda . The point of the film seems to be one about family and the importance of friendship . The film makes it's points well , and with a smile on it's face . The way that the story moves is not unlike some of John Luc-Godard's work , in that it works more through the vitality and energy of it's characters than actual plot . The crisp photography blends well with the tune that plays through a lot of the film , and this helps to instil the atmosphere that the story needs to flourish ; namely , a fun but brooding one . The cast is mostly made up on unknown / lesser known actors . Marianne Sägebrecht , a German actress takes the ' lead ' role as the German woman that finds herself at the café . She does a brilliant job in making sure that her character's ascent into being a member of the café's family is always believable . Films like this can sometimes get too over sentimental , but her downbeat performance ensures that if there is any sentiment to be detected ; it is realistic . CCH Pounder stars opposite her as the head of the family and gives a nice performance . She goes through a range of emotions , and every one of them is believable and well played out . The only real ' name ' on the cast list is Jack Palance . Again , he adds to the ensemble and helps to ensure that the film is strong in the acting department . The plotting isn't quite consistent throughout , with the nice start being followed up by a downturn for the middle . The film picks up again towards the end , however , and the completely uncharacteristic ( of the film ) dance turn at the climax helps to ensure that Bagdad café goes out with a bang .
423035	2248099	884328	8.0	Another big success for Stephen King and Frank Darabont !	Films based on the writing of Stephen King have a habit of not translating to the screen very well ; although director Frank Darabont made what is often considered the best of the Stephen King films in The Shawshank Redemption - and now with The Mist he's directed what is surely one of the major contenders for the title of best horror film to be based on a Stephen King story ! When I first heard the plot description , I was expecting the film to be a cross between John Carpenter's The Fog and modern horror disappointment Feast ; and while it does have elements of both those movies , it is thankfully much better than both . The film starts with a violent storm that leaves the Drayton family home in tatters . David Drayton sets off to the local store along with his son and a neighbour ; but the town is soon plummeted into trouble when it is surrounded by a malicious mist . It soon transpires that there are otherworldly creatures within the mist and the townsfolk in the local store find themselves battling against the creatures as well as themselves . . . The film takes on a real classic style horror feel and never tries to be exceedingly clever or overly gory and that is one of its main strengths . Frank Darabont puts his focus mainly on the tension between the characters and the atmosphere and this benefits the film as there's always enough to keep things interesting - and that is particularly impressive when you consider the thin plot and the fact that it's over two hours long . Thomas Jane takes the lead role and gives a great performance which is nicely pitched between family man and action hero . The rest of the ensemble perform well alongside the lead actor , with Marcia Gay Harden as a fanatical Christian and Toby Jones as the quiet shopkeeper stand out most . The special effects are used sparingly but are very well done and show some great imagination . The creatures that come out of the mist are varied and interesting . There is a lot of talk about the ending of this film and I have to say I'm not really surprised ; you'll either love it or hate but personally I found it to be a refreshing end to a commercial modern horror film . Overall , The Mist is an excellent horror film and can be considered a must see for anyone who is a fan of the genre !
423583	2248099	36341	8.0	A lovely little chiller from Val Lewton	Val Lewton made a name for himself within the horror genre by producing atmospheric chillers , and The Seventh Victim is one of the best of them . Although not as great as the likes of Cat People and The Body Snatcher , The Seventh Victim represents another successful fusion of intriguing mystery and atmospheric chiller . The plot revolves around a girl in a boarding school whose sister has gone missing . Upon travelling to New York in an attempt to find her , she learns all kinds of things about her sibling and the mystery increases until we eventually learn the truth about her disappearance . Like most of Lewton's films , this film is very short at just seventy minutes long but it certainly makes the most of it's running time as included in that seventy minutes is a compelling and entertaining mystery that gives many similar films that are on release today more than a run for their money . Nowadays films seem to want to be as long as they can possibly be , but a story can be adequately told with a lesser running time - and this movie proves it . The acting in the film ranges from good to not so good , with Kim Hunter being at the top end of the scale with a great debut performance , and Hugh Beaumont being at the other end with a not so great performance . It's far too over the top and gives the film a rather silly edge . However , there's a role for Lewton regular Tom Conway who plays the same character that he played in Cat People . The atmosphere in the film isn't as great as it was in The Body Snatcher or the Jacques Tourneur collaborations , but Mark Robson does a decent job with it , and the audience is always on the edge of their seats and believing that something bad is about to happen . My only taste of him before this film was his later collaboration with Lewton ( and Boris Karloff ) , ' Isle of the Dead ' and I was somewhat less than impressed so it's good to see that he didn't squander this film as well . One bad thing about this film , however , is the ending . It feels rushed and almost like it was tacked on at the last minute . It doesn't ruin it , but a more complete ending would have made this the classic it could have been .
423246	2248099	67140	8.0	Kind of like The Odd Couple , with explosions	A Fistful of Dynamite is often seen as the black sheep of Sergio Leone's commercial releases ; and there's a good reason for that , as despite the fact that it's still a spaghetti western ; it's a completely different kettle of fish to both the Dollars Trilogy and Once Upon a Time in the West . A Fistful of Dollars features common western themes such as bandits , guns and bank robberies - but , as he did with The Good , The Bad and The Ugly ; Sergio Leone has implanted war themes into the plot , and we've also got the bizarre idea of one of the major characters being an IRA bomber ! All this stuff doesn't quite come together cleanly , and as the tone of the movie changes often ; it seems obvious that Leone has bitten off a bit more than he can chew . . . but luckily enough , A Fistful of Dynamite remains a fun movie for most of its duration . The plot follows a bandit named Juan , who bumps into a dynamite-laded bomber one day in the desert . Spotting an opportunity for robbery , he manages to recruit the IRA man to his cause ; but he doesn't count on being dragged into the revolution that's going on at the same time . The first half of the movie features some very astute elements of tongue-in-cheek humour , and it seems obvious that the director isn't intending the plot to be completely serious . However , at around the halfway point ; the movie turns in completely the opposite direction , and the fun and silly first half gives way to a more deep and serious finale . For me , this is the movie's main problem ; I like a movie that's unpredictable , but this change in plot feels disjointed and doesn't go down well . The second half of the film isn't as enjoyable to watch either , which harms the fun . However , Sergio Leone's direction is as impressive as ever , with some lovely wide angle shots capturing the beautiful landscapes ; while , of course , Leone enjoys giving full focus to his actors for some extreme close-ups . Like the movie , the cast is a mixed bag . James Coburn looks the part , but his silly put-on accent makes him feel like he's having a laugh at times ; and similarly , Rod Steiger dons an arguably even sillier accent and doesn't quite get away with it . Overall , A Fistful of Dynamite is not a film to please all viewers . I found it to be enjoyable despite many niggles , but I can understand why a lot of people disagree .
423761	2248099	64208	8.0	Excellent revenge fuelled western !	Death Rides a Horse clearly follows on the tail of Sergio Leone's masterpiece Dollars Trilogy as both the style and execution of it are very similar ; but there is more than enough here to ensure that the film both stands on it's own and stands out as one of the better of the many , many Spaghetti Westerns to come out of Italy . The atmosphere of the film is very dark indeed and it's clear that director Giulio Petroni wanted to ensure that his film was as brutal and unforgiving as possible - which he succeeds in doing and that helps the plot immensely . The plot is not particularly original and focuses on the common theme of revenge . The plot focuses on a man named Bill . Fifteen years after witnessing the murder of his family , Bill sets out to track down and kill those that did it . This coincides with the release from prison of Ryan ; a bandit who was double crossed by the same men who killed Bill's family . Despite going after the gang for different ends , the two men settle their differences and form an alliance to rain justice down on those that wronged them . The main character is Diabolik star John Phillip Law , but clearly the real standout of this film is Sergio Leone veteran Lee Van Cleef who is the biggest standout of the film in his role as Ryan ; the experienced gunslinger . His Western credentials were already cemented before the release of this film ; but it's no surprise that Death Rides a Horse is one of his best known efforts . The pair gets on well together and the way that the film builds a contrast between the youth and inexperience of Law's characters with the opposite elements of Van Cleef's is remarkable . The film benefits from yet another great Ennio Morricone score and the way that the plot flows is always interesting . Giulio Petroni obviously also favours Sergio Leone's use of the extreme close-up and the film features several of those . There's a fair bit of violence which is sure to please and while this film is not as great as the Dollars Trilogy from which it takes its influence ; it's certainly a top end Spaghetti Western that fans of this genre will not want to miss . Recommended !
423173	2248099	74952	8.0	Plenty of violent action in Lenzi's masterpiece cop drama !	Umberto Lenzi tried his hand at just about every popular type of film in Italy during the sixties , seventies and eighties , and while he has some very nice entries on his list of directorial credits ; it has to be said that he isn't the best director to try his hand at the likes of Giallo , zombie and cannibal movies . However , when it comes to crime films ; Lenzi comes into his own , and just like Almost Human a couple of years earlier , Violent Naples is an entertaining and nasty little crime thriller . Like every film in this sub-genre , the major influence comes from the masterpiece American film ' Dirty Harry ' , and here we follow a copper not too far removed from Clint Eastwood's famous character . Commissario Betti is your typical disgruntled cop that favours violence over proper police procedure . He's fed up with the way that Naples is being run by the criminals , and so sets his sights on The Commandante . However , this man isn't easy to bring down , and since Betti is receiving no help from his fellow townsmen , the task of ending crime in Naples is left to our leading man . The title of the film leads the viewer to expect lots of violence , and Lenzi certainly doesn't disappoint in this respect . We've got bowling balls to the head , a young woman having her face scraped off on a moving train , a man impaled on a sharp fence and many other such delights . Overall , it has to be said that this film isn't very original , but Lenzi injects some freshness into it with a barrage of exciting chase scenes ( the best of which take a point of view shot from the front of a motorbike ) and violent shootouts . The good thing about these Polizia movies is that they are played out for pure entertainment value , meaning that Lenzi is free from trying to be arty , and can pack in as much violence as he likes ; a fact which is often capitalised on . The film benefits from a strong Italian cast , including Maurizio Merli ; who may be no Clint Eastwood , but still delivers a strong and entertaining lead performance . John Saxon gets to join in the fun also , and there's also a place for fellow American actor Barry Sullivan , in the role of the villain . Overall , if you're into Italian cop movies ; this isn't one to miss !
421835	2248099	64186	8.0	One of Lenzi's best Giallo's !	Umberto Lenzi Giallo's range in quality from sublime to trash , but his earlier genre entries tended to be the best ; and So Sweet . . . So Perverse is certainly at the higher end of Lenzi's Giallo achievements . One of the trademarks of Giallo is a high dosage of sex scenes ; but despite the fact that this film has the word ' perverse ' in it's title ; So Sweet . . . So Perverse is actually not all that perverse at all , especially not by Giallo standards . Rather , the film focuses more on the plot details than perversity , and it just about serves it well . Italian directors were famous for ripping of successful films from other countries , and the plot here is clearly lifted from the French classic ' Les Diaboliques ' . We focus on a couple with marital problems ; Jean and Danielle . When Jean hears a woman screaming in the upstairs apartment one day , he immediately decides to investigate . There he finds Nicole ; a woman frightened of her boyfriend Klaus . The pair soon begin to fall in love , but it later transpires that this was just a trap set to snare Jean . . . So Sweet . . . So Perverse is a classy little thriller and much unlike later Lenzi Giallo's such as Eyeball , almost everything about the film is well done . The film benefits from a good cast , which feature early Lenzi muse Carroll Baker in the central female . Baker's role here initially appears to be a lot like her role in the earlier ' Orgasmo ' , but she soon gets to switch to a more interesting character . Baker is joined by the sexy Erika Blanc , and like most Giallo's with two sexy leading women ; the pair do get to get it on , although you shouldn't go in expecting a full blown lesbian sex scene . Jean-Louis Trintignant rounds off the cast , but isn't given as much to do as the ladies . The plot does get a bit slow at times , but the film never slows down to the point of becoming boring . The second half is much more exciting than the first as that is when the plot gets into full flow . When the twists start to come into play , So Sweet . . . So Perverse really is an intriguing thriller and unlike many Giallo's , this one also features an ending that wraps most of the plot up nicely . This film is highly recommended to Giallo fans !
423926	2248099	44876	8.0	Classic Ealing Gem	The Man in the White Suit is one of those delightful comedies that Ealing studies made so well in the 40's and 50's . The plot of this one follows a man that invents a cloth that neither gets dirty nor breaks . Of course , this is a huge breakthrough in the world of textiles . However , things are not that simple as the cloth will threaten the way of life of many people , including cloth manufacturers , the cloth mill's workforces , and even an old lady that does her washing every week . The Man in the White Suit is a film about scientific advances , and the way that they don't always help ; as the old woman says at one point in the movie , " Why cant you scientists just leave things alone ? " Like a lot Ealing comedies , this one stars Sir Alec Guinness . Alec Guinness is a fantastic actor ; he has the ability to light up the screen with his presence ( and he does in this film , literally ) , but he also manages to portray his characters in a down to earth and believable way . He is suitably creepy in this film , and he captures just the right atmosphere for his character ; an intelligent and ambitious , but slightly naive scientist . Along with Guinness , The Man in the White Suit also features Joan Greenwood , the deep voiced actress that co-starred with Guinness in the simply divine " Kind Hearts and Coronets " and Michael Gough , a man that would go on to get himself the role of Alfred in the Batman films . The acting in the film isn't always great , but it is always decent , and it's fits with the film . The Man in the White Suit is an intelligent , thought-provoking and witty comedy with a moral . The comedy isn't always obvious , and it doesn't always work , but the film is not meant to be a film that provokes belly laughs , so that is forgivable . I recommend this movie , basically , to anyone that is a fan of movies .
421886	2248099	64323	8.0	An excellent showcase of suspense cinema !	Claude Chabrol is sometimes known as ' The French Hitchcock ' , and while the two didn't exactly make the same type of thriller ; it's easy to see where the comparisons come from , and both of these great directors are masters of their crafts ! This is only the third Chabrol film I've seen , but once again I'm extremely impressed and looking forward to seeing more ! Though I have limited experience of his films , Chabrol's thrillers to me are more brooding and personal than Hitchcock's ; and while they lack the brazen thriller element that made most of Hitchcock's oeuvre so good to watch , it's made up for in panache and intrigue ! The Unfaithful Wife puts its focus on an upper class French family in a big mansion somewhere just outside of a big city . We follow them for a short while until it becomes obvious to the husband that his wife's constant trips into town are a clue that she is having an affair . The husband then decides to hire a private detective to investigate his wife , and after having his fears concerned ; the husband turns up at the lover's house with murder in mind . . . The film appears to be so relaxed that at times you may wonder whether you are actually watching a thriller . But that is what makes this film so effective ; Chabrol often lets his film settle , but there is always tension bubbling beneath the surface and the film is always intriguing , even when there is little going on . I won't spend too long talking about the acting and production values as obviously both are thoroughly professional and give the film infinite amounts of credibility . Most of the action focuses on the couple inside their big house and this benefits the film greatly as we soon get to know the characters . The central scene is clearly the murder sequence , although again Chabrol focuses on the build up rather than the actual pay off and the murder is as cold and brutal as it was obviously intended to be . The Unfaithful Wife is clearly a lesson in how suspense cinema should be ; even more subtle than Hitchcock , this film manages to be constantly fascinating in spite of the fact that not a great deal transpires over the course of the film , and once again it's another great film on Chabrol's resume !
422839	2248099	71233	8.0	Great and very original take on the classic vampire tale	Blood for Dracula definitely takes the prize for the most odd take on the classic story that I've ever seen . Not that I'm saying that in a bad way , however ; not at all , it's most definitely a good thing ! Director Paul Morrissey has created a horror movie that is camp to the point that it pokes fun at the European style that it is a part of . Udo Kier stars as the title character , but he's not the Dracula that have horror fans have come to expect . . . not at all . It is with the character that this movie's main element of originality comes into play . We are used to seeing the count being all-powerful and drinking the blood of numerous victims , but here the king of vampires doesn't quite appear to be himself . The Dracula in this movie is a frail man , almost at the point of death . He needs the blood of virgins in order to maintain himself , but the girls in his native Romania are somewhat less than innocent . He therefore decides to travel to Italy , as it's a religious country and that is leading him to believe that the girls there will still have their innocence intact . The story picks up when Dracula is invited to stay at the home of a family with four daughters . Blood for Dracula is an extremely sleazy movie , and despite being primarily about vampirism ; there's far more nudity than gore in the film . In fact , the film isn't even all that gory for the most part , and it's only the ending that goes all out for sick gore . The story is well done and inventive , particularly during the moments when Dracula drinks the girls ' blood , only to find that she wasn't a virgin after all . Seeing the count writhe in pain after drinking the wrong blood isn't something you will see in many takes on the classic story ; so this version gets plaudits for that . It also gets plaudits for an outstanding performance from the great cult actor Udo Kier . His screen presence fits the role that Morrissey has given him like a glove , and Kier impresses throughout the film . The obscure element of humour is nice and gives the film a real cult movie feel . Because the film is so absurd , it wont be enjoyed by all viewers . But if you like your horror to be different and inventive , you could do a hell of a lot worse than this flick !
422735	2248099	67446	8.0	Slightly flawed - but only slightly !	Luciano Ercoli is famous for making three Giallo films ; two of which are among the best that the genre has to offer , and along with The Forbidden Photos of a Lady Above Suspicion , Death Walks on High Heels is among the best of the director's films . It would be fair to level criticism at this film , as it is slightly overlong and I guessed most of the major points before they happened ; but that doesn't change the fact that this is a fun film and well worth seeing . One common element of the Giallo is a convoluted plot - and this film delights in featuring one of the most convoluted of the whole genre . The story takes in a number of characters , all fuelled by desires of lust , revenge and / or greed . The plot picks up after the attack on Nicole Rochard . The attack seems to have something to do with a stash of diamonds , but when questioned ; she appears to know nothing about them . She decides to travel to England along with an eye doctor , and gets followed by her French boyfriend ; a man that she believes may be the attacker . They move to a quaint English seaside village , where all appears to be safe . . . Luciano Ercoli does a good job of setting the scene for this film , and the English village at the centre of the story provides a nice tranquil location for a murder fuelled film like this one . The vast amount of characters involved do bring the film down a little bit , but they also ensure that there's always something going on ; and most would agree that it's better to have an overcomplicated plot than an underdeveloped one . Unfortunately , however , there isn't a great deal of gore in the film . The ensemble cast do well , and once again Ercoli's then spouse Susan Scott heads the cast . Scott does well at delivering the seductive and sultry lead performance that we're used to from her ; although it's unfortunate that she doesn't get a great deal of screen time . The rest of the cast is good also , with Ercoli's other frequent collaborator Simón Andreu giving the best performance of the support . It's fairly easy to get confused during this film , but unlike many other Giallo's , at least almost everything here makes sense by the end . Ercoli tops the film off with a strong ending that sees all the characters get their comeuppance , and overall ; this is a strong film and comes highly recommended !
422623	2248099	40367	8.0	A typical Wilder film - one where everything works !	Nobody has an understanding of American cinema quite like the great Billy Wilder , and even though this isn't his strongest effort ; Wilder still makes sure it works . Billy Wilder is a name commonly associated with American cinema , but this film takes place in Germany . The film is both a romantic comedy and a nod towards post-world war 2 Germany , when the country was divided up between Britain , France , Russia and the United States . The way that the great writer-director combines these two elements is brilliant , and too much is never given to either one ; thus ensuring that the film works as a whole , rather than one that seems too caught up in delivering two sides - and that is testament to the talent of the main creative force behind the movie . The plot is typical for Wilder in that it doesn't focus on the mundane , and follows a congress officer investigating army morals in the US sector . While there , she stumbles on evidence that says ex-Nazi turned café singer , Erika , is being protected by an army captain . Captain John Pringle is on hand to help her out . . . only she doesn't realise that the man protecting the café singer and Captain John Pringle are the same man ! You can always count on Billy Wilder to pull great performances from his cast , and he's done that here . The central threesome of Jean Arthur , Marlene Dietrich and John Lund put in excellent performances , which create the right mood for the piece and ensure that their characters are believable . This was one of the last screen performances for Jean Arthur , and she certainly makes the best of it ; her character is the linchpin of the piece , so a lot of the movie's success is up to her . This film was released during a tentative period with regards to the rebuilding of Germany , so it's both a brave endeavour for a man who had to flee the country to escape becoming embroiled in Hitler's propaganda campaign , and a film that will always be interesting for its historical relevance . The comedy element does play second fiddle to the more important factors , but it doesn't matter too much ; as I wasn't watching this expecting to laugh my head off , and what humour there is , is generally quite funny . Overall ; this isn't one of Wilder's top quality movies , but it's definitely one his better secondary ones ; and well worth seeing for that reason .
421971	2248099	64300	8.0	Good western action	Five Man Army may not be as epic or as groundbreaking as other Spaghetti Western films , but it's a lot of fun to watch and overall , provides a good slice of western action . My main reason for tracking down and seeing this film is due to the fact that it was co-scripted by Italian horror maestro and one of the men behind Sergio Leone's masterpiece ' Once Upon a Time in the West ' , Dario Argento . Argento worked on scripts for a number of Spaghetti westerns , and while this is only the second that I've seen ( Leone's masterwork being the other one ) , it's the one that gets mentioned second most often , which leads to believe that it's one of his best . The plot centres on a man named ' The Dutchman ' , who hatches a plot to rob a train of $500 , 000 worth of gold . He can't do it on his own , however , and so recruits the services of four men with expertise in different areas . They all have something to prove , and the $1000 he's offering for their help gives them the initiative to try and prove it . The film then follows the makeshift ' Five Man Army ' , as they steal the gold . The film begins with a man going round asking the prospective members of the army to join the foolhardy scheme . This sort of plot device is common in the movie , as it's all rather simply told . However , if you ask me this is a good thing as some films like this tend to get a bit too complicated , and it can take something away from the enjoyment of watching . There's plenty else to enjoy too , as Argento and his fellow scriptwriter have managed to create a varied assortment of characters that play well off one another and , of course , there's all the explosions and shootouts that Spaghetti Western fans have come to expect . It does have to be said that there's not as much violence in this film as there is in similar movies , as much of the movie focuses on the train robbery at the end , which is pulled off with very little bloodshed . The acting is decent enough also , with veteran actor Peter Graves heading up a good versatile cast , which fit into their roles well . Ennio Morricone provides another good western score , and overall , this film is always going to be a target for fans of Argento's work . I won't recommend going into the film with high expectations , but it's a fun viewing and I enjoyed it .
421918	2248099	49006	8.0	Last but by no means least for Lang !	For his final Hollywood film , Fritz Lang decided to expose the pitfalls of capital punishment for circumstantial evidence . For this film , Lang has kept it simple ; with the entire movie focusing on the central premise and not a lot of anything else going on . Filmmakers can sometimes saturate a film with lots of sub-plots , and it can have a huge detrimental effect on what the film is trying to achieve . By keeping it simple , Lang gives himself time to fully explore the implications of his plot and the film is made more compelling because of this . The story follows Austin Spencer ; a person of stature that is continually campaigning against circumstantial evidence being used as a means to send someone to the electric chair . His efforts are unsuccessful , until he has the bright idea to have a man sent to death row on circumstantial evidence , only to be pardoned at the last minute by means of the evidence to prove his innocence being brought to light . Enter Tom Garrett ; Austin's son in law to be , and the man that agrees to frame himself for murder . . . This is perhaps Lang's best assault on the American justice system ; he has created a story that is interesting and very plausible and it works a treat in that it gets you thinking about the fact that with this kind of law ; someone really could be killed for something they didn't do . Of course , the chances of someone risking being put to death to expose this are unlikely , but then again ; it's only a movie , so you can expect to suspend your belief a little for a point to be made . Beyond a Reasonable Doubt also features one of the most finely tuned plot twists that I've seen in a movie . Lang shows us everything about the plot ; from the first ideas , to the setting up , all the way to the trial and because of this ; the final twist comes as a complete surprise . It's been done and done a million times since this film , but despite this ; Beyond a Reasonable Doubt still has the power to shock the viewer . Beyond a Reasonable Doubt is one of the highlights of Lang's illustrious filmography . It has an unfairly low IMDb rating , and I hope that you will not use that as a means of deciding whether or not to see this film . It is efficient story telling at it's best and this is one of the highlights of the film noir era .
422403	2248099	120888	8.0	Great entertainment with a lot of heart	A little known fact about me is that I'm a big fan of fluffy romantic comedies . Why wouldn't you want to spend 90 minutes or so watching a film ; laughing and ultimately feeling good at the end of it ? I don't consider fluffy romance films to be at the absolute top of cinema , but they're good fun , and therefore get a thumbs up from me . The Wedding Singer , however , gets not one thumb up ; but both thumbs , firmly , up . So , why does The Wedding Singer succeed more than most films in it's sub genre ? Is it the jokes ? The beautiful female lead ? The gratuitous helping of 80's pop songs ? No , it's that this movie has a lot of heart ; that's what makes it a winner . Adam Sandler stars as the quintessential ' loser ' . He's a wedding singer , and not a very good one either . He specialises in doing terrible covers of 80's songs . It's not the sort of act that I would want at my wedding . His life gets worse one day , his wedding day , to be exact , when someone doesn't turn up . The bride , that is . Now in a deep spiral of depression , our hero doesn't see any way forward . His next gig is a washout and there's love all around him ; even his newfound friend , the cute little waitress that works at the same place as him is getting married . And to a man who doesn't deserve her , I might add . I don't think I really need to tell you what comes next , but even though it's a predictable ride ; trust me , it's a ride you want to be on . Adam Sandler tends to be a very annoying actor ; and for that reason he is almost universally disliked , but it is undeniable that he is good in this movie . Nobody else could have given the character what Sandler gave him ; his performance is both entertaining and believable , and therefore is just right for the movie . Drew Barrymore was also perfectly cast . She is the perfect girl in this movie ; all smiles and sunshine , and it's impossible not to fall in love with her . The movie also features great little turn from Steve Buscemi , who provides the film with one of it's funniest moments towards the start . As mentioned ; The Wedding Singer has a lot of heart . From the way that the characters interact with each other , particularly Sandler and Barrymore , it is obvious that they are in love . The movie also has some points to make on the subject of love ; The Wedding Singer portrays that being in love is overall better than being a ' Fonz ' type , womanising character . The message at the movie's centre is also a worthwhile one ; the movie professes that it isn't important who you fall in love with ; it doesn't matter whether or not he's merely a wedding singer , all that matters is the love between two people . The movie says that love is all you need ; and that is a worthwhile message in any movie . The movie's message is lost somewhat under the barrage of jokes ; but it's most certainly there and I for one think that it's a shame that a movie that is entertaining and funny can't be considered in the same league as other , more serious movies with a similar message . Overall , The Wedding Singer is at the very top of the romantic comedy genre . It will make you laugh , and you will ultimately feel for the characters . The fact that this movie has something to say is only another reason to recommend it ; especially as it says it with a great big smile on it's face . The Wedding Singer is not a film that you will want to miss ; it's feel-good at it's best .
422023	2248099	734603	9.0	Fear of the unknown ; the most frightening of all	Every time I see The Twilight Zone , I become more and more impressed with it ! Nothing in the Dark is a story about the most frightening thing known to man ; the unknown . The themes of mortality and fear are well felt in a story of an old woman who forces herself to remain in her small tin shack . She remains there through fear ; fear that death may claim her . When she finds a young wounded policeman on her doorstep , she faces a dilemma - does she let him in , and risk letting death claim her - or does she let him die ? This episode is shot entirely inside one room , and yet never becomes dull or uninteresting . The claustrophobic feel bodes well with the dark plot , and the way that the program takes an age-old fear and spins a story out of it is fantastic . Gladys Cooper is excellent in the lead role ; delivering a performance that is both abstract , yet believable at the same time . The episode also features an early role for one Robert Redford , who gives an early glimpse of his charisma in his role as the policeman . The climax to the tale will probably be guessed way before the ending ; but The Twilight Zone is never completely predictable , and it still manages to pull something out of the bag at the end ! Nothing in the Dark is surely one of the best episodes of Rod Serling's " The Twilight Zone " and comes hugely recommended from me !
422431	2248099	70453	9.0	Another brooding and intriguing film from Claude Chabrol !	I was very surprised upon reading some of the comments for this film after having seen it - not only is this not a lesser Chabrol movie or a non-entertaining one , for my money its Chabrol at his subtle and intriguing best , and no doubt up there with the likes of The Unfaithful Wife and Le Boucher ! The plot is not particularly original , but it's not too important as it's Chabrol's style and attention to detail that really makes the film what it is anyway . The plot seems to take a lot of influence from the classic ' The Postman Always Rings Twice ' and focuses on murder due to an illicit love affair . Lucienne Delamare is not so happily married to town major Paul Delamare and , unbeknown to her husband , is currently engaged in an affair with her husband's assistant Pierre Maury . The two are able to spend time together because Paul is often away on business . Pierre's wife Clotilde is weak and sick and when she dies suddenly , the town suspect suicide ; but the truth is more sinister , as revealed by Pierre's confession to Lucienne . . . The film is kept interesting as Chabrol always focuses on the important elements and ensures that the chemistry between the leads is always engaging . The acting is once again superb with Chabrol's beautiful wife ( at the time ) Stéphane Audran being suitably brooding and mysterious in the lead role and receiving excellent support from Michel Piccoli and Claude Piéplu . The village in which the film takes place is also well thought out and Chabrol manages to create a foreboding atmosphere stemming from that . As usual with Chabrol films , this one is beautifully shot and realised and it's clear that the director put a lot of care and attention into the film . As usual , the suspense is generated through intrigue and the way that the characters are developed rather than through scenes of tension , though there are some brilliant sequences in the film - a pivotal scene towards the end involving a car accident being particularly noteworthy . I wouldn't recommend this film as a starting point for someone who has not previously seen a Claude Chabrol film , but I'd be surprised if fans of his don't enjoy it . Highly recommended !
422566	2248099	74287	9.0	Nightmarish and original - a Giallo masterpiece !	I'm a massive fan of Giallo , but it has to be said that a lot of Giallo's are rather similar to one another and while there are a few exceptions , there isn't a massive amount of diversity in the genre ; especially not when it comes to the lesser films . The House With the Windows That Laugh features the trademark wacky title , but other than that ; this really isn't anything like any other Giallo out there , which will certainly divide opinions ; but for me , this is also one of the best of the genre . The film is directed by Pupi Avati , a cult director most famous for his slow burning horror films with a nightmarish climax . The plot focuses on a man named Stefano , who is sent to a church to restore a fresco representing the suffering of St . Sebastiano , the last painting by an artist named Legnani ; a mentally disturbed man whose every painting represented someone in agony . The painting intrigues Stefano , as do a number of events surrounding his time with it , and he begins to investigate . . . but it's an investigation that turns into a nightmare as he discovers the horrible truth behind the painting . . . The main reason why this film works is down to the atmosphere . There isn't a great deal of action , which is bound to isolate some viewers ; but Avati keeps the foreboding atmosphere bubbling over , which ensures that the film is always interesting . The plot is highly original , and I don't believe I've ever seen another film with the same themes featured as this film . The opening sequence , which features a man being tortured in a sepia montage , will give you something of an idea of what to expect ; though I doubt anyone will guess how the tale will end , and that cant even be said of the some of the best Giallo's . Quite how writers Pupa and Antonio Avati came up with it is anyone's guess , but I'm certainly pleased that they did ! The film does touch on a few other Giallo trademarks ; there are a couple of murders and some red herrings thrown in , but it's not until the film finally reveals itself at the end that the bleak nightmare comes to the forefront ; and it's certainly a climax worth waiting for ! Overall , The House with the Windows That Laugh is an ingenious piece of cinema and one of the best Giallo's ever made !
421664	2248099	65677	9.0	Supremely sexy Giallo mystery !	The Forbidden Photos of a Lady above Suspicion is a Giallo that is different to what most fans will be used to , as the graphic , over the top murder scenes have been scrapped in favour of a sexually charged plot line . I was worried that this might not work out , as murders are a key element of this sort of film for me - but to my surprise , Luciano Ercoli has turned out another first rate Giallo that makes up for it's lack of blood with a constant stream of intrigue . The film works from a script by Giallo luminary Ernesto Gastaldi , who manages to keep every other Giallo trademark besides murder in the film . The atmosphere is charged with desire and frustration , and the central plot ; which features blackmail , sex and mystery makes best use of its array of amoral and perverse characters . The film focuses on Minou ; the attractive wife of a businessman named Peter . The story picks up when Minou is attacked by a stranger on a beach who informs her that her husband has committed murder and blackmails her into sleeping with him . The plot then takes another turn when the assailant furthers the blackmail with pictures of their rendezvous . . . Luciano Ercoli is never going to get huge respect from Giallo fans simply for the fact that he hasn't made a great deal of films ; but it seems that the ones he has made get rated down too often , and just like Death Walks at Midnight - Forbidden Photos is an underrated Giallo . The director does an excellent job of ensuring that Forbidden Photos fits the plot in terms of look and style . The lighting and scene setting is excellent , and the upper class locations bode well with the central cast of characters . The acting is also surprisingly high quality with Dagmar Lassander impressing in the lead role . She is joined by Pier Paolo Capponi who takes the sinister role of her husband , while the cast is rounded off by the talented Susan Scott , whose husband and director Luciano Ercoli allows her to steal every scene she's in . The bisexual element of Scott's character fits the film well , and provides more perversion to the already sleazy atmosphere . The plot is significantly less convoluted than most Giallo's , but if you ask me ; this is a good thing as it allows the director to put all the implications of the story across without being bogged down by plot details . Overall , this is a great Giallo film and while I know that it's high praise - I really wouldn't hesitate to list it alongside Gastaldi's collaborations with Sergio Martino in a list of premium Giallo films . Highly recommended !
422601	2248099	1020530	9.0	Grisly and upsetting - fantastic modern horror !	I don't think I'm the only one that has been less than impressed with the bulk of the horror films released in 2008 ; most of what's on offer could be categorised as either a useless Hostel / Saw clone or yet another remake , and it's disappointing considering the excellent releases earlier in the decade . Eden Lake may not score highly in the originality stakes , but the fact that it's so well done more than makes up for the fact that any serious genre fan is likely to have seen films just like this one before . The plot focuses on a young loved up couple ; a primary school teacher and her boyfriend Steve . They decide to go to an old disused quarry for a romantic weekend , but find their idyllic peace disrupted when a group of young thugs begin harassing them . Naturally , the couple won't allow their weekend to be spoiled by a bunch of kids , but as the situation escalates ; the couple begin to realise that the youngsters are rather more dangerous than first thought , and their trip soon turns into a nightmare . Eden Lake would be best described as ' survival horror ' and works mainly due to the realism . The two characters at the centre of the film are both likable and their actions are always understandable , which makes them easy enough to get on with . When the trouble first starts , it doesn't seem like anything too far out of the ordinary ; and the director does a good job of building up to the first problem , before letting things escalate at a steady and exciting pace . One of the things I liked most about the film is the setting . The disused quarry and woods where everything happens is really beautiful and this brilliantly offsets the grisly violence . The violence takes a while to kick in , but that makes it all the more shocking when it does . There's nothing over the top in this film ; everything is kept at a reasonable level , but the fact that the director has made us care about the characters and their fates makes the film hard to watch at times . The antagonists are a group of kids and while they at first seem like only a small threat ; they do become pretty formidable as the film moves on . Overall , this is a fantastic horror movie that fans of the genre won't want to miss , and it also stands tall as one of the best British films in years ! Highly recommended .
422186	2248099	324133	9.0	Anything but dull	Swimming Pool is a first rate film from French genius François Ozon . This thriller makes best use of everything that makes cinema great , and it is therefore a delight to view . Swimming Pool follows Sarah Morton , a British author that travels to her publisher's dream home in France in order to have a rest while she works on her new book . However , her tranquillity is soon disturbed when her publisher's daughter ; a sex-crazed , good time girl , turns up out of the blue and turns Morton's rest into something quite different . One criticism that could be , and has been , made of this film is that not a lot a lot happens . That , however , depends on your viewpoint ; the action is stretched , but the relaxed tone of the film blends magnificently with the beautiful French scenery , and Ozon's attention to detail with the characters ensures that , although slow , Swimming Pool never descends into boredom and there's always something on offer for it's audience to enjoy . I , personally , was completely entranced from start to finish . The casting of Charlotte Rampling as the uptight British novelist really was an inspired move . She's absolutely brilliant in the role , and you can't imagine anyone else playing that character to such a degree . Speaking of great casting choices , Ludivine Sagnier is similarly brilliant as Rampling's sexy co-star . She brings just the right amount of insecurity and lustfulness to her role , and it's not hard to see why Ozon continues to cast her in his movies . The film is very melodramatic , but never overacted ; and this is a testament to the quality of acting on display . Swimming Pool benefits implicitly from a haunting soundtrack , which perfectly accents the happenings on screen , and certain points in the movie where the soundtrack is used are truly electrifying . François Ozon is truly one of cinema's greatest assets at the moment . This is only my second taste of his work ( the hilariously fabulous ' Sitcom ' being the other ) , and if his backlog and future releases match the quality of the two films I've seen from him so far ; he may well become one of cinema's all time greats .
423477	2248099	74954	9.0	Fantastic seventies flick !	Nashville Girl falls somewhere between an exploitation flick and a drama , but I'm not surprised that this is often considered an exploitation classic ; as there are more than enough exploitative elements and the drama itself is interesting also . The film takes place in the Deep South and primarily focuses on the country music industry , although lots of other things come into play too . The main reason this film is so good is because of the way the narrative works ; so many things happen in this film and it really doesn't become boring even for a minute , which is definitely much to its credit . The main character is Jamie Barker ; a young country girl living in a no good town . She's out skinny dipping one day and attracts some unwanted attention from a no good hick type who proceeds to go ahead and rape her . The young girl is upset and confused and after an argument with her parents , decides to go to Nashville in order to find fame and fortune . So she sets off hitch hiking and gets a lift with two truckers before eventually reaching Nashville and finding that the way to the top is not always paved with gold . Monica Gayle takes the lead role and does excellently with it . She really convinces as the naive young girl at the film's centre and her likable persona is a real credit to the film . There's really nothing wrong with her performance and I'm surprised the actress didn't go on to make more films . Gus Trikonis ( who would go on to direct the low budget horror The Evil a couple of years later ) directs this film well ; creating just enough of a sleazy atmosphere to please exploitation fans . The way that Nashville is portrayed is gritty and sleazy and while there's not much actual sleaze in the film , the atmosphere is a benefit to it . I can't say I'm a fan of this sort of music ; but the songs featured are catchy enough and well sang . I don't know if Monica Gayle did her own singing ; I'd like to think so , but she probably didn't . Anyway , this film is engrossing for its entire ninety minute runtime and it all boils down to a satisfying conclusion . Overall , Nashville Girl is an excellent little film that could do to be better known . Fans of seventies thrillers will want to check this little flick out !
422395	2248099	55505	9.0	A major highlight for Hammer studios !	Whenever I think of Hammer Horror , I think of bright colourful camp films ; but Hammer also made a handful of black and white mysteries , and many of these stand up as some of their best films . Hysteria , Nightmare and Paranoiac are all very good films ; but Seth Holt's Taste of Fear tops the lot ! This suspenseful mystery draws the viewer in from the start and doesn't let go until the credits role . The film introduces the wheelchair bound character Penny Appleby ; an amiable young girl who strives for independence in spite of her disability . The story picks up upon her return home to the French Riviera for the first time in ten years at the request of her father . Her nightmare starts when she begins seeing the corpse of her father at random places around the house and grounds of the place where she's staying . The friendly chauffeur Bob decides to help the girl get to the bottom of the mystery , but everything is turned upside down when it becomes obvious that nobody in the film is what they appear . Initially , the film plays out like it's going to be quite predictable ; and indeed , my prediction for what is going to happen actually does happen . . . but director Seth Holt doesn't show his hand too early , and there is a major twist at the end that I certainly didn't see coming . Director Seth Holt does a really good job with this film , as he gets good performances out of all his cast , the twists are well worked ; and best of all , the atmosphere is scintillating ! Holt continually imposes an oppressive air of foreboding over the film , and the creepy house provides a fantastic location for a film like this to take place . The film features a relatively small role for Hammer regular , Christopher Lee , who gets to don a silly accent while remaining mysterious . Lead actress Susan Strasberg is the pick of the cast , however , as aside from being stunning ; she's not a bad actress either . The film works principally because it keeps the focus on the mystery , and this means that it retains its thriller intentions throughout . Overall , this might be a lesser known Hammer film ; but it's not lesser in quality , and I wouldn't hesitate to name this as one of the best films the studio ever produced .
421712	2248099	65143	10.0	Argento's debut Giallo is a fine one indeed !	Bird with the Crystal Plumage , the first and best of the " Animals " trilogy is an important film . First of all , it's the directorial debut of a man who is without doubt one of the finest and most important horror directors to ever pick up a camera , and secondly because this is a film that set a lot of the ground rules that Argento would abide by in his later movies ; such as the harassing phone calls , the protagonist that sees something that later turns out to be something else and , of course , the black gloved killer . The plot follows Sam Dalmas , an American writer , staying in Rome that witnesses the attempted murder of a young woman inside an art gallery . After initially helping the police by telling them as much as he knows , Sam decides to conduct an investigation into the murder on his own . However , as he delves deeper and deeper into the mystery , he becomes more and more intrigued and has to find out who the killer is - even though he might just end up the next victim . The principal reason that Bird With the Crystal Plumage succeeds is it's plotting . Italian horror has never been known for coherent plots , but with this film you'd be forgiven for forgetting that . Unlike with some of his other films , Argento clearly knows what he wants to do with this film and he does it . The plotting is efficient , and little time is wasted deviating away from the central premise , which allows Argento to connect with story and bring out the best from it . The film creates an almost constant sense of dread and tension , and we really feel like the killer is on our protagonist's tail all the time . This is done by all sorts of methods , such as the phone calls from the killer to things such as our hero being chased while out for a walk with his girlfriend . Argento constantly keeps his audience on the edge of their seat by throwing in these things , and also by the way that the murder investigation is conduced . Argento puts his audience at the centre of the riddle and via the various clues that Argento gives us , we are able to work the mystery out for ourselves . Bird With the Crystal Plumage also features an incredible soundtrack courtesy of a man that is probably the greatest composer of all time ? Ennio Morricone . Ennio's score doesn't rival the ones that he did for Sergio Leone ( what does ? ) , but it is a great score in it's own right and more than does the film proud . Even though this film is the first that Argento ever directed , it easily stands up to the rest of his oeuvre and surpasses most of it , mostly due to the fact that it's such an assured picture . With his later Giallo's , such as Profondo Rosso or Tenebre , Argento would become more ambitious and start adding more to his plots , and don't get me wrong ; I'm a big fan of those films , but with this one Argento has proved that a film doesn't need a big plot to create an enticing mystery . Bird With the Crystal Plumage is at the very top of the Giallo sub genre and easily ranks as one of the best films that Argento ever made . Highly recommended viewing .
422614	2248099	117883	10.0	Absolute first rate thriller !	Tesis is a film about a film student writing an assignment on violence on film , which is appropriate because Tesis is itself , an assignment written by Alejandro Amenábar on violence and the state of the Spanish film industry . Amenábar has packed the film with nods towards the industry , and the reasons why it isn't working and this ties in excellently with the central theme of violence . The director professes that Spain's film industry will not be a success until it gives the people what it wants - and that theory in it's purest form is snuff films . Snuff films don't have any production values and exist purely to please their audience on an aesthetic level - and the snuff industry in this film is in a boom period ! The idea of violence and why we find it is fascinating has made the base for many films , and it serves this one excellently too . The scene at the start sums all up ; we open in a train station where someone has committed suicide . The station guards are trying to ensure that nobody sees the horror , and yet there's scores of people surrounding the tracks and Amenábar makes sure that even you - the viewer - want to survey the horror for yourself . I don't know how successful Tesis was in it's native Spain , but it's certainly one of the best films to come out of the country in recent memory , and a lot of the reason for that is that the director has heeded his own advice and given the audience what they want . Rather than try and be deep and complex like many other foreign films , Tesis is a straight thriller , not unlike what would come out of America's thriving industry , and the fact that Amenábar has knowingly accepted what his film is and hasn't tried to make it any more than that does it no end of favours . The film follows a relaxed pace , and the basic structure follows a mystery , which is being unravelled by two students ; Angela , the one doing the thesis and Chema ; someone she met because of his infamous love for violent films . The way that Amenábar keeps the film flowing steadily ensures that we are really able to get into the mystery , and this makes the film far more thrilling overall . The film is about snuff films , but it shouldn't be mistaken for one itself . The focus is often kept away from violence , and the director only shows us just enough of the snuff to whet our appetites . The film's main point is to show us the mystery , but the characters are never made to take a backseat . The two central figures are given time to grow as people so that we can really get to know them , and even feel for them . In many thrillers , the characters and the mystery can't be weighed up evenly ; but despite the fact that he's only a young filmmaker , Amenábar has shown his brilliance by doing it to perfection . The characters actually compliment the mystery , in fact , because at times it flows because of who the characters are . This really allows the film to become compelling , and this is also where most of the true greatness lies . The characters are brought to life by a great cast of young actors . The beautiful Ana Torrent takes the lead role , and is joined by débutant Fele Martínez , who plays her opposite number . These two have an awkward chemistry , and this is capitalised on brilliantly . The third lead is played by Eduardo Noriega , who would go on to make a splash in Amenábar's Open Your Eyes a year later . Tesis doesn't get mentioned all that often in discussions about great horror / thrillers - and I really have no idea why . This is a first rate film , and really shows its cast and director's talent . The Spanish film industry may be on the decline - but it wont be if they can pump out a few more films like this one !
423529	2248099	64888	10.0	Dark and eerie Eurohorror gem !	Director Narciso Ibáñez Serrador is most famous for his under-seen cult gem , ' Who Can Kill a Child ? ' , but this Gothic horror treat is definitely well worth tracking down ! Perhaps not as original or thought provoking as Serrador's later film , The House That Screamed presents it's situation and characters well , and the atmosphere that the director bathes every scene in is a major highlight . The film works like a cross between a film about imprisoned women ( along the same lines as Pete Walker's masterpiece ' House of Whipcord ' ) and an Italian Giallo ; although it's clear that Serrador wanted to keep the focus on the girls ' and their plight , as the murder theme exists almost like an afterthought . The film focuses on a French boarding school for wayward girls . The owner and mistress of this establishment is the unforgiving Mme Fourneau , who sees fit to enforce a strict discipline upon her pupils , which has lead to widespread deviance among the girls . The mistress is never more strict with anyone than her own son , however , who has fallen in love with one of the girls , leading his mother to tell him that he should find a girl " just like her " . . . It's amazing that this film was made in 1969 , as the production values are amazing owing to the director's care and attention to detail , and it's also clear that this film was a major inspiration for a barrage of later Gothic horror films , including Dario Argento's most famous film ' Suspiria ' . Its own influence comes from Gothic horror the likes of which the great Mario Bava is famous for producing , and the dark and gloomy look of the school bodes excellently with the themes of the plot . Lilli Palmer is the pick of the cast , and delivers an excellent strong lead performance in the lead role . She receives decent feedback from the likes of Cristina Galbó and John Moulder-Brown who , along with the rest of the support players , help to ensure that this is above a lot of Euro-sleaze being released around the same time . The murders aren't the main point of the film , and while they're not overly gory or brutal ; they work well in the context of the movie , and succeed in being extremely stylish . The film ends on a definite high , as although the identity of the murderer isn't a shock ; the reason for the killings completely caught me out and the dark and shocking finale is a treat . Overall , this masterpiece comes HIGHLY recommended to fans of cult horror !
