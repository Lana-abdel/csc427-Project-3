422819	2248099	66434	2.0	Dull and disappointing science fiction flick	George Lucas will , of course , always be remembered for his masterpiece ; the Star Wars series , and for good reason ; as he hasn't done much else . While American Graffiti was a nice non-Star Wars film for the man , this one ; THX-1138 certainly isn't . For a man who made such a big impact on the Sci-Fi / Fantasy genres with Star Wars , you would expect his first foray into those territories to be at least an acceptable film ; but this isn't . Plodding along with an astute dullness , it's hard to be left anything but cold by this film . It's obvious that Lucas wanted to throw in as much Sci-Fi as possible into the film , and this has resulted in the movie resembling a mish-mash of science fiction orientated sequences , which comes very much at the expense of the story . The thin plot follows two people , living in the distant future where sex and love in general have been banned , who have found themselves in jail for breaking the laws of the place they live in . They then decide to breakout with the help of some guy they meet in there . Lucas has seen fit to give the film a style similar to that of Sci-Fi masterpiece 2001 : A Space Odyssey and this style-stealing is somewhat ironic considering that this is the same man that would go on to revitalise the genre six years later with his masterpiece . The people in the film all sport white uniforms and shaved heads and while this enables Lucas to present a regimented vision of the future that compliments the plot and style of the movie , it also means that none of the actors stand out , and since all of them , even the great Robert Duvall and the normally solid Donald Pleasance , find themselves with not a lot to do ; it can't be said that this is an actor's movie . The way that the plot meanders and never really allows the audience the plug into it , is the film's major downfall . Unlike Star Wars , which relied on storytelling to be a success ; this movie relies more on atmosphere and visuals and while Lucas can do these things , he's far too set on doing them and this kills the movie . The same thing happened with the first two Star Wars prequels . Overall - a major disappointment !
422672	2248099	65483	2.0	More utter crap from Andy Milligan	Andy Milligan has firmly established himself in my mind as probably the worst horror director of all time . Despite making decent sexploitation flick ' Seeds ' in 1968 , Milligan has succeeded only in boring me to death with the rest of his crappy oeuvre since then , and this film is certainly no exception . I really don't understand this director at all ; it seems like he's trying to make some sort of point as his films all have a similar style , but somehow nothing comes out of them but boredom . Take the plot pace of this film as an example ; it's painfully slow and the dialogues are delivered by actors who sound like they're close to death . Quite how Milligan made this film and didn't realise how dull it was is anyone's guess . . . my only thought on the matter is that perhaps it was the director's intention to torture his audience ? The plot supposedly revolves around vampires but for all I care they could have been clowns , postmen , FBI agents or French maids . . . it doesn't really matter . No film made with as little enthusiasm as this is ever going to be interesting , and after seeing five Milligan films ; I doubt I'll be seeing another .
423801	2248099	126527	2.0	An awful mess and complete waste of film stock	As I suspect is the case with most people who have seen this film , it was the title that attracted me to it . However , I actually wish that a less witty one had been selected , because then I might not have bothered with this silly little slasher flick . In fairness , the film has suffered a lot in production ; but somehow I suspect that A Night to Dismember was never going to be a masterpiece . The film differs from the majority of slashers as much of it is told from the point of view of a detective in the form of voice-over . However , this idea is squandered immediately because of the fact that his voice sounds ridiculous , thus giving the whole piece a jokey sort of feel , and it's squandered further because most of what he's saying is delivered in a very patronising manner . The ' plot ' follows a young woman and her release from a mental hospital . I'm sure you can guess where that idea is going , and we follow the guy from the voice over as he pieces the clues together and tries to get to the bottom of the brutal murder spree . To be honest , I'm glad that a lot of footage for this film was lost ; because I really don't think I could stomach much more of this film . Despite being just over an hour long , A Night to Dismember is really boring ; I had a headache before watching it , and it only got worse as A Night to Dismember droned on . And on . The disjointed approach to the plotting ensures that it's extremely difficult to get into the film , and this is made worse by the fact that the plot is extremely derivative , like most slashers . The violence is fairly extreme , but it's so inept that it generates more laughs than scares . There's a scene that sees someone put their hand through someone's chest and squeeze their heart . . . and it looks like it was put together by a below average team of five year olds . The final twist really puts the tin hat on the piece , as it's thrown in at the last minute without any build up , thus making it impossible to care or be shocked by it . Of course , I'd heard this film was bad going into it , but for some reason I didn't want to believe it . I believe it now and wish I hadn't bothered ; A Night to Dismember is not recommended .
421914	2248099	338763	2.0	Dull and uninteresting - a great shame	The original Battle Royale is one of my favourite films of all time . It's fusion of extreme violence and a thought provoking , complex substance made for a very different and refreshing movie . The sequel , unfortunately , is merely a stale variation on the events of the first film . It's ironic that this sequel is a complete disaster as making a sequel to ' Battle Royale ' should be one of the easiest tasks of all time . It's simple ; another battle royale , with all the uncompromising violence of the first , and to continue the story ; we'll have Nanahara , survivor of the first film , put back into the frey . Simple . But no ; for some reason , the writers have opted for some drivel involving Nanahara becoming an internationally wanted terrorists and an act known as ' BR 2 ' , whereby school children are ' hired ' to fight terrorist threats . . . or something . Now , you might be thinking along the lines of " well , as long as there's school kids with weapons , I'm happy ' ; but it's no again . The film plays out more like a feature length version of the start of Saving Private Ryan . That's it ; it's more or less a simple war film . Damn . One of the things that made the first film work was the underlying theme that the violence is coming from children that know each other , killing each other . This gave the film a soul-searching horrific edge ; " could you kill your best friend " was the tagline , and the film got it's depth from that . Here , that message is gone ; and it's replacement is a dull ' anti-war ' one . The film piles on the sentiment in an effort to get it's message across , but it never really succeeds . The film also seems keen to prioritise it's ' Requiem ' subtitle . Far too keen , in fact . The requiem sequences were the worst thing about the first film ; interrupting the adrenaline pumping action sequences all too regularly , I don't doubt that I'm the only person who feels this way . Battle Royale 2 is much like one long requiem sequence , with characters ' reflecting ' left and right and the film on the whole suffers because of this . If the film had focused more on character development , the reflecting parts might have worked because we would have cared ; but it doesn't , so we don't . Pretty stupid really . Battle Royale 2 isn't completely devoid of positive aspects , however ; the first half hour is definitely good . Going back to how it was in the first film , we see a group of unwitting school children kidnapped by the government and , of course , the hysteria that results in a couple of the kids ending up dead . Although this is almost a complete copy of the first film ( we've got knives being thrown , necklaces exploding etc ) , it works because the first film worked , and fans of the original masterpiece will no doubt enjoy it . However ; when I said that I'd have been happy with just ' another Battle Royale ' , I did mean one that's different from the first one , not just a remake of it . In fact , the sequel takes most of the ideas from the first film and reuses them ; from the danger zones to the maniacal teacher who delights in seeing his kids maimed and killed . The only real new idea in the movie is the idea of the ' tag game ' , which involves the detonators being linked to each other , so if your partner dies ; you go too . However , although this is a fairly good new idea , it doesn't make sense . . . . you see , the government want these kids to kill Nanahara , so why do they make it hard for them ? Why not send them in with an army of tanks and just have done with it ? Why not just bombard the island with napalm ? On that note : I deem this movie ridiculous and pointless , and therefore not worth your time . Even if you like the original as I do ; this film is one to miss .
423671	2248099	74769	2.0	Extremely poor Satanic horror	Peter Cushing and Donald Pleasance are legendary actors , and director Kostas Karagiannis was the man behind the successful Greek Giallo-esquire thriller Death Kiss in 1974 ; and yet when you combine the three talents , all you get is this complete load of drivel ! God only knows what drove the likes of Peter Cushing and Donald Pleasance to star in this cheapie devil worship flick , but I really do hope they were well paid as neither one deserves something as amateurish as this on their resumes . The story focuses on a group of devil worshippers that kidnap some kids , leading another group to go after them . The pace of the plot is very slow and this ensures that the film is very boring . The plot is also a long way from being original and anyone with even a passing interest in the horror genre will have seen something a bit like this , and no doubt done much better . The obvious lack of budget is felt throughout and the film doesn't manage to overcome this at any point . This really is a depressing and miserable watch and not even a slightly decent ending manages to up the ante enough to lift this film out of the very bottom of the barrel . Extremely poor stuff and definitely not recommended !
422251	2248099	73794	3.0	Boring vampire film	Peter Cushing in a vampire movie . Sound good ? Yes I thought so too . . . until I saw Tender Dracula . This is a French film and comes across as something like an arty Hammer Horror flick . The plot focuses on two writers . They go on a trip with their girlfriends ( who both look like men in drag ) and end up at the castle of an aging actor . He is famous for portraying vampires on screen ; but as the night progresses , the group begins to wonder if the man is really acting when he is on screen . The film basically consists of eighty five minutes of boring dialogue and as you can probably imagine ; it gets boring quickly . The copy I saw was of really poor quality ; but in spite of that it's clear that the film doesn't utilise any particularly interesting locations which helps to make it more of a dull experience . The title , ' Tender Dracula ' lead me to believe that it might be some sort of soft-core porn outing , but there's no sex or nudity in the film and the title is quite inappropriate . I'd hesitate even to call this a horror film really since there's no actual horror in it . Tender Dracula is a ' lost ' film , and really that is for good reason and I doubt it will be resurfacing any time soon !
422570	2248099	91707	3.0	Seeing this film wouldn't be one of my three wishes	I was worried that this film might be just an eighties version of the crappy nineties horror ' Wishmaster ' , but as it happens ; it would have been a better film if it were . The problem with this film , ironically considering it's a trashy eighties horror film , is simply that it's boring . It starts out slow , and even when the rudimentary bunch of dumb teens start to get picked off , the film never really picks up . It's a shame really as the idea of an evil genie wreaking havoc is actually quite a good one , but this film just doesn't do it justice . The plot focuses on a magic lamp which is stolen from an old woman's house . The lamp ends up in a museum when the thieves are killed . When the museum curator's daughter is possessed , she invites a bunch of friends for fun and games in the museum basement , and everyone ends up coming a cropper . I can live with bad acting and nauseating dialogue , even crappy special effects . . . but the story needs to be good to compensate , and this film is far too simple . The genie itself looks about as scary as your average lump of plasticine , and while the film features a few moments of gory horror ; overall , it's not good enough . The Lamp certainly doesn't come recommended .
422346	2248099	221633	4.0	Another insect related horror flick	I have to admit : I love films about rampaging bugs ! These flicks are often gruesome and gory , and the exaggerated insight into the insect world is often fascinating ; but They Nest is certainly not one of the best example of this type of film . In fact , for the first hour of the film ; practically nothing happens at all ! There are one or two deaths , but none of them are imaginative and really the film just goes through the motions for the first hour ; then things start to heat up and the excitement levels still fail to get off the ground . Obviously with this being a TV movie , you can't go into it expecting too much , but I've seen TV movies deliver much more than this . The films is set on an island , and the insect that it focuses on is giant cockroaches . They've become mutated somehow and now have a taste for flesh as well as some other new features . New in town doctor , Dr . Cahill , discovers these creatures and tries to warn the locals about them ; but since the townsfolk aren't keen on him , nobody will believe him . . . They Nest is wholly unoriginal as there are a lot of films different only for the fact that it's a different insect at the centre of the story . The plot surrounding these cockroaches is basically non-existent and the film gives you no real reason to care about anything or anybody in it . There isn't a great deal of atmosphere either ; the island setting is well used , but the director doesn't manage to enforce its presence and the location isn't really all that important to the storyline . Naturally , since it was made for TV , the film doesn't really feature any violence that will make gore fans want to take note ; there are a few nasty Alien style chest busting sequences , but that is about it . The insects themselves look like regular giant cockroaches to me , and the film just relies on the fact that there are a lot of them to create terror . It's not really very terrifying , however , unless of course you happen to have a fear of cockroaches . It all boils down to a predictable and dreary conclusion and finishes with the same ending that all these films finish with . Overall ; They Nest isn't really worth seeing .
421874	2248099	70368	4.0	Dull and boring period horror	The Hand That Feeds the Dead apparently is often confused with a film called Lover of the Monster . That's not at all surprising ; they're both directed by Sergio Garrone , feature basically the same cast ( both headed by Klaus Kinski ) , both were released in 1974 , they both feature similar plots and even some of the same footage . Unfortunately , they're also both rubbish . After seeing Lover of the Monster recently , I had it in my head that at least it couldn't be worse than The Hand That Feeds the Dead - but I was wrong , as despite a very nice title ; this film is utter dross . The film takes place in the nineteenth century and focuses on a doctor by the name of Prof Nijinski . He stumbles upon an old laboratory in his basement and begins experimenting with life and death ( yadda , yadda ) . Of course , the experiments go wrong and end up messing with the doctors head . I have to admit that the version I saw was sourced from a Turkish VHS and was cut down to about seventy eight minutes . I don't know exactly what was cut out , but I'm guessing it was all the good bits because we haven't been left with much . I'm sure that some of the gore was cut out because I didn't see much of it ; there were a few skin graft scenes but overall the film is very lacking on that front . The period setting and obvious low budget gives the film something of a gritty feel that works fairly well with the plot but is nowhere near enough to save the production on the whole . Klaus Kinski is undoubtedly one of the major stars of cult cinema , but even his presence is not enough to lift this production ; frankly he looked about as bored as I was . The pace is very slow and the editing is inept , which makes the film even harder to watch . I really didn't care what happened at the end and the climax was not interesting anyway . This film has vanished into obscurity since its release and I'm not at all surprised about that . The Hand That Feeds the Dead is nowhere as interesting as it sounds and is not recommended !
422965	2248099	78791	4.0	Tedium reigns supreme in a house on the outskirts of Madrid	Spain will be remembered by many film fans for a lot of very good horror movies and thrillers ; but unfortunately many Spanish directors go overboard with the idea of ' slow burn ' and tedium becomes the end result - and that unfortunately is the case with this film . That House in the Outskirts takes slow burn to the extreme and essentially nothing happens for the entire running time . The script is the main problem as it's trite and doesn't do much at all in the way of progressing the story or providing dialogue with enough about it to make any of the characters interesting . The story focuses on a husband and wife who rent an old isolated house outside of Madrid so the wife can relax while she is pregnant . However , luck would have it that the house they rent just happens to be the same house that was once a private clinic where the wife went for an illegal abortion years earlier . Naturally , the house brings back bad memories , and the upstairs neighbour just happens to have been the abortionist's assistant . . . The plot does not sound particularly interesting on its own ; but the idea of pregnancy and abortion has lead to horrifying films before ( most recently with French horror ' Inside ' ) and I was hoping that might create some interest . It really doesn't . The film can't even be called a thriller as it doesn't ' thrill ' in any way , shape or form and fails at being anything other than a cure for insomnia . It has to be said that it is rather well made ; director Eugenio Martín lays the atmosphere on thick and the acting is rather good ; but it means nothing when the film is so painful to sit through . Alida Valli ( whom cult fans will recognise as Suspiria's Miss Tanner ) is the pick of the performers and actually provides the film with one of its only plus points . It soon becomes clear that the ending is not going to provide anything of interest ; and indeed that is the case . I can only imagine the high ratings this film has received is down to the fact that it's an arty and obscure ; but don't be taken in by it . That House in the Outskirts is definitely not worth the trouble of tracking it down !
422099	2248099	74829	4.0	Tedious and dull exploitation nonsense	This film ends with a speech in which the narrator tells us the fates of two of the lead characters and that the names of people and places have been changed . . . before telling us that relation to actual people and events are purely coincidental . This ending line actually sums up everything that has gone before it ; as Rino Di Silvestro's messy film completely lacks vision , and if there is any point to the plot ; it wasn't put there on purpose . Werewolf Woman is often seen as a guilty pleasure or a ' so bad it's good ' film , but I completely disagree . Normally , I enjoy films like this ; but Werewolf Woman is indeed a bad film , and despite all the sex and savagery on display ; it doesn't even make for a fun watch , and that really is unforgivable . The film really doesn't have much plot , but the thin sliver we are given involves a young woman , who also happens to dream that she is a werewolf . She dreams of going out and finding men , having sex with them and eventually killing them . Back in the real world , she falls in love , but her lover is killed and she goes out for revenge . . . The film is made up of scenes of sex and gore , which are padded out with extremely dull talking sequences in which various characters mull over the recent events . These scenes are probably there to forward the plot and build characters ; but they really don't do that , and succeed only in turning what could have been a passable exploitation romp into an extremely underwhelming film . It would seem that the director was more interested in style and atmosphere than the plot , and this is shown by the fact that the film looks and sounds nice . The sex scenes are often overlong and not very erotic , but the gore works well . The premise is ripe for giving way to a very sexy slice of exploitation , as there's plenty of naked women , and the fact that the central character has a werewolf origin means that there could be plenty of erotica ; but this isn't capitalised on , and while I can stomach huge doses of bad acting and poorly done plot lines , I really can't stand watching films and being bored . Overall , I wouldn't even recommend this film to big exploitation fans . There's plenty of better stuff than this out there , and while the title may sound intriguing - the film isn't .
422040	2248099	235686	4.0	Overlong and dull porno !	Well , since it's called Porno Holocaust and directed by Joe D'Amato , I went into this film expecting sleaze . . . and while I somewhat got it , Porno Holocaust was a massive disappointment as it's just so damned BORING . The title suggests that the film will feature porn , and that's not wrong - Porno Holocaust is pretty much just porn , and most of it is just the same stuff over and over again , I was fast forwarding before the end . The first sex scene is between two women and it got my hopes up , but after that it just degenerates into normal porn , and the rest of the film ( for the first hour ! ) is made up of talking , and you can imagine how much fun that is to sit through ! The plot focuses on a deserted island where , believe it or not , something strange is going on . Naturally , it's not long before a group of people - made up of a few men and some scientists , who all happen to be sexy women , land on the island . They have sex a few times and some strange things happen , then over an hour later they're attacked by a mutant zombie creature with an eye for the ladies . . . This must have seemed like a good idea for an original porno - a zombie who likes to get it on , but unsurprisingly it doesn't work well at all . The film clocks in at just ten minutes short of the two hour mark , and that is far too long for a film like this . I have no idea why Porno Holocaust is as long as it is ; if they'd just snipped one minute out of every sex scene , the film would have been under ninety minutes , and that would have made it much more tolerable ! The zombie takes what seems like an eternity to appear ( it's quite a long time before there's a sex break long enough for them to actually travel to the island in the first place ) , and when it does finally appear , it's a huge disappointment ! I realise that this is low budget B-movie trash , but D'Amato surely could have tried a bit harder and come up with something better than this ! I'm not even going to bother mentioning the acting , atmosphere etc , there's no point . Porno Holocaust is basically just your average dull porn flick with a slight sprinkling of horror , and I can't recommend it !
423597	2248099	87998	5.0	Cheap and cheerful Alien rip-off	During the eighties there were more bona fide cult classics released than one could shake a stick at , and while this film has all the makings of being a cult classic ; for my money , it's just a cheap Alien rip-off that makes good use of a small budget in some ways , but didn't do much for me . The most notable thing about the film is obviously the monster itself , and it's an interesting creation and is brought to the screen in a manner that is boisterous and fun . It's clear that the film is meant to be a horror-comedy , but the comedy is not really funny and the film is not scary because of the focus on comedy . There's a fair bit of gore featured , but again it's cheap and cheerful and not really up to much . None of the characters are engaging and I couldn't really care less what happened to any of them . The focus is very small scale , focusing mostly on a farmhouse and it's good because it keeps the action contained and since the central monster is fairly big , it looks more impressive in the small surroundings . But there's not a great deal of invention and I felt like I've seen all this stuff before . You've got to give some respect to low budget stuff like this for the fact that it didn't have a lot of resources to draw on ; but it just didn't do much for me .
423209	2248099	171089	5.0	Women's prisons in Brazil are sleazier than most !	Well I've got to say that I do enjoy a good slice of sleaze ; but I also like there to be some sort of narrative to keep my interest , and this film lacks that ; which leaves it feeling rather shallow and pointless . As the title suggests , Bare Behind Bars is another one of those ' women in prison ' films , and the fact that it hails from Brazil means that you can certainly count on gratuitous sex and nudity , which this film features in droves . There's all sorts of stuff going on , from lesbian sex to the use of dildo's and other implements , and everyone in the prison gets involved ; from the prisoners to the guards and everyone in-between . The only slight hint of plot revolves around a prison break , which happens towards the end . There's a fair amount of violence to go with the sex and general sleaze , which includes certain male body parts being removed and , on one occasion , being fed to the family dog ! However , while this film has everything you could want in terms of sleaze ; the lack of any plot at all really does harm it . Obviously this is not a genre that is well known for great stories , but this film is shallow even by genre standards ; and while I'm not an expert on sleazy women in prison flicks - Jess Franco has certainly done better .
423729	2248099	105459	5.0	Awful British accents in a silly lost nineties flick	Split Second is one of those nineties films that was forgotten five minutes after it was released ; and upon discovering the film , I've got to say that I can understand why this film was forgotten . Split Second isn't a particularly ' bad ' film ; but it's not very good either . The plot and execution are reminiscent of a number of earlier films , and this one doesn't offer much , if anything at all , in the way of originality . The film also suffers from a series of nuisances that bring the film down . The first and most obvious of these irritations is the large amount of incredibly fake and silly British accents . Much of the cast is British , but the ' hard man ' accents don't bode well with the film . Chief among the rest of the flies in the ointment is the fact that the film takes place in a futuristic environment ; but doesn't make any use of it ! Split Second follows a tough guy copper in London 2008 , after global warming has ravaged the city and , presumably , the rest of the planet . He's on the case of the murder of his partner , which is supposed to have been perpetrated by some strange monster . . . It was the plot that attracted me to this film , and staying true to the rest of the movie ; it's a big disappointment . Rather than run with the idea of a monster on the loose in futuristic London , instead the director focuses on the dull relationship between his central characters ; which mostly revolves around Neil Duncan's student cop unsuccessfully trying to bring out a sensitive side in Rutger Hauer's stone faced policeman , only to be ' amusingly ' brushed away . Hauer's lead performance isn't very impressive , as the actor that stunned audiences in the likes of Blade Runner and The Hitcher looks uncomfortable delivering the painful script , and doesn't work well in the good guy role . Support comes from the likes of Kim Cattral , Pete Postlethwaite and Ian Dury ( of Blockheads fame ) . The action is sometimes well paced and exciting , but more often than not it isn't present ; as the film constantly revolves around the more boring elements of the plot . Don't get me wrong ; there's a lot worse forgotten nineties films out there - but Split Second isn't up to much , and is best left on the shelf in the ' ex-rentals ' section .
422359	2248099	78067	5.0	Lead character and audience in comas	Patrick gets off to a good start as we watch a young kid kill his mother and her lover ; but the influence of Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece Psycho ends there as the rest of the film is as dull as dishwater . The film's main gimmick stems from its central character ; obviously named Patrick . He's grown up from having caused his mother's death and has been in a coma all of his adult life . We pick up the story when a new nurse starts at the hospital and is put in charge of Patrick . Shortly thereafter , strange things start to happen and Patrick appears to have a telekinetic ability which he uses to kill people . It's a decent premise for a film , but in order for it to work ; the plot really needs some excitement . The film is sadly lacking in that department and I actually felt like I was slipping into a coma on several occasions . Obviously the killer doesn't have a personality to speak of , and so we are left only with the supporting cast of characters - which are all dull and don't manage to hold the audience's attention enough on their own . Unfortunately , director Richard Franklin doesn't even reward us with some interesting death scenes . Overall , this is a boring movie that isn't helped by its near two hour running time and one that I wouldn't recommend to anyone .
421809	2248099	289879	5.0	It's Not Such a Wonderful Life	I must say that I was surprised , after seeing this movie , to come to it's page on this website to be met with a barrage of largely positive reviews . While I can certainly see the attraction of this movie ; the fact is , it simply isn't very good . The version of The Butterfly Effect that I saw was the largely more liked ' Directors Cut ' version , so whether or not the theatre version is better , I don't know . The muddled plot follows Evan Treborn ; a young man that suffered from black outs as a child , and has found a way to not only remember these black outs as an adult , but go back in time and change them . Which is something that has a massive effect on his current life . As you might expect , this plot opens up a number of plot holes ; and that's the first thing that is wrong with this movie . If you want to make a movie about something confusing , at least make sure that everything makes sense . . . and if that's not possible , at least make some sort of story that could be used in conjunction with the audience's imagination to fill the plot holes . And that's only the start of The Butterfly Effect's woes . The film's main problem is simply that it's RIDICULOUS . The whole thing comes off as being very phoney and just about every event in the film can be described as either ' over the top ' or just far too convenient . The action , therefore , is just stupid and hard to fully connect with because of that . At several points in the movie , I asked myself how one guy could be so unlucky ; and you will too . When you cant believe in a film's plot , that film has failed and that is what has happened to this film . Before seeing it , I thought that Ashton Kutcher might have been the film's downfall ; but ironically , he's one of the best things about the movie . While his performance is far from brilliant , at least Kutcher has fun with the role and his verve helps the film to swing along . Another thing that can be credited to the film is that at least it doesn't get boring , which is something that it could well have done due to the muddled plot . However , the good aspects are sapped up by the terrible ending , which swallows both any point that the film may have had and also betrays all the confidence put into the film by the viewers up until that point . The film draws it's substance from the idea that we are products our memories and the effect that our actions can have on ours and others ' lives . As you will see at the end ; the movie never really knew what to do with it .
423863	2248099	60716	5.0	Mostly lacklustre Italian Gothic horror	I was really expecting something pretty good from The Embalmer . . . but unfortunately all I got was a dreary horror flick with a couple of good ideas and a complete lack of suspense . The film was apparently inspired by Edgar Wallace , who was the inspiration for a lot of the German " Krimi " style of film-making . Not being too familiar with Wallace's work , I can't say how true that is - but The Embalmer is certainly not the Giallo I was expecting . The film is set in Venice , and makes best use of the scenery . . . though it does get a bit boring as the film sets the scene without putting anything relevant to the story with it ! The film was possibly an inspiration on the brilliant Dutch " Giallo " Amsterdamned as it focuses on a killer who lives under the Venetian canals . The killer is selecting young women of Venice and dragging them to the depths of the canal , where he has his way with them - by filling them up with embalming fluid to keep them beautiful for all time ( etc etc ) . A journalist picks up the story , and soon ends up falling in love with the killer's next victim . The main problem with this film is that it's entirely lacklustre ! The cinematography , acting , direction , plot line etc all stink of a group of people that couldn't really be bothered to come up with something half decent . The film is not very suspenseful at all , and a lot of is made up of mind numbing diatribe , which means that when we actually get to watch the killer with his victims , most viewers will already be bored out of their brains . The killer himself looks cool - completed clad in black with a skull mask , but that's the only good thing about him . He makes long winded speeches to his dead victims that were obviously intended to be scary , but actually come as being rather silly . It does boil down to a fairly decent finale , which despite not justifying the rest of the film ; at least ensures that the movie doesn't just leave a bad taste in the viewer's mouths by the end of the film . Overall , this is a good film to track down because it's extremely rare and seen in some circles as a precursor to the Giallo genre - but trust me , it's not worth the time and effort !
421743	2248099	286594	5.0	I am feeling sleepy . . .	After a promising start that sees our hero look into a female patient's mind whilst she is under hypnosis , this psycho-drama quickly degenerates into the realms of familiarity and becomes a rather turgid and dull thriller . The story follows that of Michael Strother ( Goran Visnjic ) , a hypnotist that can also read minds . While treating a patient ( Shirley Henderson ) for smoking one day , he has a vision of a young girl drowning and we later find out that she is the only escaped victim from a serial killer known as ' The Tattoo killer ' . Naturally , Michael gets drawn in to help the police with their investigation . A film like this has no end of possibilities for imaginative and exciting sequences , but the movie features very little of them . The best scene . . . and only good scene , really , comes from the death of one of the central characters , which is one of the most disturbing and painful I have ever seen ; an incision is made in his chest and then , while he's still alive , a live rat is inserted into the hole . The thoughts you could have about that are endless ! The film does have a good aspect in that there is a lot of tension . Even though the characters are underdeveloped and we don't ever really feel the need to care for them ; the film piles on the tension and some scenes are literally nail-biting . Notice I said ' some scenes ' , though . . . for every time it works , there's another time where it didn't . Doctor Sleep is a film that was funded by the BBC , which is ironic as it feels very much like one of those drama series ' that the BBC puts out . The director , Nick Willing is also the genius behind two other made for TV outings ; remakes of Alice in Wonderland and Jason and the Argonauts . But it's not his direction that makes this feel like made-for-TV , it's the acting that does it . For the most part , it's awful ! The actors don't look or sound like they are putting in any effort at all , and most of their voices sound very put on . The ensemble of actors that have been put together is a mixed bag indeed . Goran Visnjic stars , and he's not bad . He's never brilliant , but at least he's believable . Starring opposite him is Shirley Henderson . Her performance is the worst in the movie , and maybe one of the worst ever . She's a good-looking lady , but she can't act . Paddy Considine , who you may remember from the overrated " In America " , appears for a little while and he's not bad , and Miranda Otto ; the most impressive lady in Lord of the Rings , is very much wasted . The script is also of note in this film . Of note for being really bad , that is . It feels , at times , like it has been written by a couple of eight year olds . No , that's unfair ; a couple of eight year olds and a monkey , a clever monkey even ( as stupid ones don't know how to write ) . Some of the things that the characters say are absolutely ridiculous and totally unrealistic , such as the exchange between Goran and the gasman , and the episode of about 5 minutes where , it seems , the scriptwriters have tried to give Shirley Henderson as many swear words as possible to say . It's a shame overall as this could have been a decent thriller to rival the big American ones , had they have chosen a better lead actress , hired a professional scriptwriter , been more imaginative and not had the whole thing feel like a poor made-for-TV movie . . . . oh well .
421902	2248099	360486	5.0	Don't expect this to be another A-quality comic book flick . . .	Much like the halfbreeds of it's plot , Constantine treacherously treads a thin line between a divide . The film isn't dark or deep enough to be considered along the same lines as the likes of Batman Begins , and at the same time it's not camp or over the top enough to be considered a ' fun ' comic book flick . This is one of the main pitfalls for the film , as with this strange placing of the film ; it has cut out both of the comic book audiences , and left itself with a film that is as muddled as it's lead actor's acting is weak . The plot seems to jump from one happening to another , often without any kind of explanation or logic . This makes viewing this film a very turgid experience , and the fact that the plotting is so carelessly done has also left the movie a good twenty minutes overlong ; which only serves in making the film more painful . It's a shame that this film isn't better , as it has a plot that could have lent itself to a very fun flick . The plot follows John Constantine ; a man that can see the demons that live among us . When policewoman Angela Dodson's sister apparently commits suicide , the two team up and discover a conspiracy beneath the surface of their native Los Angeles . Keanu Reeves often gets criticised for his acting , and for good reason - he's rubbish . He slinks his way through the film , giving the very same nonchalant emotion to every scene and event that he comes across . The good thing is that a downtrodden character like John Constantine suits him , so it's not as bad as it could have been . . . but on the other hand , if a talented actor were given the role ; the film would have been much better . Keanu's " Chain Reaction " co-star , Racheal Weisz joins him again here , and pretty much does the same thing that he does - i . e . just ' appear ' . You don't go into a movie like this expecting good acting really ; but this film doesn't have even have ' acting ' ! The only performance I really enjoyed was Peter Stormare in the role of Satan , and that only lasted about five minutes . The special effects are typically dazzling , and while it's not the best CGI of all time ; it's imaginatively used and provides the movie with it's main asset . It's a shame that this film is a flop , as the film noir elements of the plot could really have delivered something interesting , the subject of devils and demons always makes for fun viewing ; and the recent run of comic book films has been quite impressive . . . but impressive , this film is not , and on the whole I recommend giving it a miss .
424006	2248099	222368	5.0	Some good ideas , but dull plotting spoils it	Well , after reading all the good reviews ; some of which coming from reviewers that I often agree with , I was really looking forward to seeing The Nameless . After having sat down and watched it , however , I'm really disappointed . The film is not really ' bad ' , but it's not very good either and that's a shame considering that the film clearly so much wanted to be a great thriller . The plot is not very original , though that isn't the film's main problem . Many recycled plots have sprung great movies ; the main problem here is that the plot moves too slowly and it's never interesting enough to remain thrilling for the duration . The film does have a few nice ideas , though . The Nameless starts with an editor named Claudia , who goes to identify the mutilated body of her dead daughter . The body has had every trace of its identity removed and can only be identified by a bracelet and the fact that one leg was slightly shorter than the other . Five years later , however , Claudia receives a call . . . from her daughter , who is begging her mother to save her . Director Jaume Balagueró , who later went on to make the even more disappointing horror thriller ' Darkness ' does manage to create a nice atmosphere for the film . Everything looks slightly grey , which makes it depressing and in turn serves the film well . I would guess that the film's main influence was David Fincher's hit ' Seven ' as the two are very similar in tone . The film was made in Spain , and that is also disappointing . Spain , along with Italy , made some of the very best thrillers in the seventies , but the recent output of this genre from both countries has been disappointing - the Italian ' Occhi Di Cristallo ' is another example of this . The recent films have lost what made them great previously , presumably because they're attempting to copy recent American films . The plot sort of drones on for the first eighty minutes as the dull characters uncover various facts and clues , and finally the film becomes interesting in the last ten minutes - though by this time , of course , it's already too late . The film was based on a good idea and it does have a few nice moments ; but overall I would have to rate this as not much more than an interesting failure .
422127	2248099	79156	5.0	This lake ain't placid !	A year after The Mountain of the Cannibal God , Sergio Martino decided to go back into the jungle - although instead of bloodthirsty cannibals , this time he brought with him a ridiculous looking fake crocodile ! The influence from this film obviously came primarily from Steven Spielberg's Jaws ( which was a big hit among Italian film directors in the seventies ) , with a bit of the cannibal sub-genre thrown in for good measure . It's safe to say that this film isn't very good - and has nothing on Sergio Martino's more successful films ( his Giallo's in particular ) , but at least the film is fun enough for most of the duration . The plot revolves around a legendary crocodile that lives near a tourist resort in Africa . Unfortunately , the over-sized crocodile is not pleased about the tourists ' intrusion and so takes it upon itself to kill everyone ! On the land , the natives believe that they are being killed by the tourists and so they take to the lake in a boat . . . but in the lake , the hungry crocodile awaits them ! Of Martino's three jungle movies ( the other two being The Mountain of the Cannibal God and Island of the Fish Men ) , this one is definitely the weakest , although it's not all bad news as it's still entertaining enough . Naturally , the crocodile looks completely ridiculous but this adds charm to the film and I'd rather see a silly looking and obviously fake crocodile terrorising people than a CGI one . Unlike Martino's other films , this one doesn't feature much in the way of gore , nudity or sleaze which is a shame as I would have preferred more of all three . Like Island of the Fish Men , this film stars Barbara Bach and again she looks absolutely great . Her co-star is Claudio Cassinelli ( also from Island of the Fish Men , as well as Mountain of the Cannibal God ) and he looks the part as the rugged male lead . The scenery is good and the film is obviously shot on location , which helps Sergio Martino to build the atmosphere surrounding the " mythical " central monster . Overall , The Big Alligator River is silly and fairly poor quality , but it's a fun viewing and therefore isn't all bad .
422303	2248099	94597	5.0	The poor man's eighties horror film ( the same poor man who spent all his money phoning up silly horoscope lines )	Eighties horror tends to vary ; it can be either trashy and great or trashy and trash , and unfortunately this film belongs more in the latter category . But that's not to say it's all bad ! Freddy Krueger himself , Robert Englund directs a film about an outsider getting their revenge , in the style of films like Carrie and Evilspeak . The plot isn't very original , as we've got a rather common ' evil down the phone ' theme , and it also features some kid getting possessed . In fact , it's not even a world away from A Nightmare on Elm Street , in which Englund made his name ; but unfortunately , even some of the sequels to Craven's commercial hit are better than this film . The plot follows some kid who finds an advert for a ' horrorscope ' . Naturally , he can't resist phoning it up , and neither can his younger cousin ( it would have gone straight in the bin if I'd found it ) . Unfortunately , it turns out that whoever rings this number gets possessed by the devil and begins getting his revenge on all those who have wronged him . As you've probably guessed ; brains aren't a major strongpoint here . The relationship between the two cousins that the film centres on makes up its backbone , and it could have been good if Englund had spent a bit more time concentrating on it . Unsurprisingly , the kill scenes and gore seem to be Englund's main priority , and while I don't necessarily have a problem with this ; the final third is pretty much entirely about the younger cousin's ' revenge ' , and it doesn't take long to get really boring . Before that , however , the film seems to be mimicking the USA's other popular genre in the eighties ; teen comedy , and it's actually quite funny with it . It becomes rather annoying at the end when just about everything you've seen leading up to it amounts to nothing , though . The acting isn't too bad , with future gay porn star Stephen Geoffreys taking the lead role and convincing as a young kid despite actually being in his mid-twenties during filming . Patrick O'Bryan is his opposite number , and while it's not exactly a mystery as to why he hasn't made many films since , he puts in a decent performance overall . On the whole , this isn't a horror classic ; and it's not really all that good either , but if you're into eighties horror ; there's something here .
421913	2248099	36261	5.0	Not the best version of this classic tale	The Phantom of the Opera is one of the greatest horror stories ever written . No wait , scratch that understatement ; it's one of the greatest stories ever written , period . The Gothic setting of the story mixed with the tragedy of it's lead and the heartbreak of his lust for the young opera singer combine to make a very interesting and unique tale indeed , but when it comes to cinema ; it's never had a truly satisfying adaptation . Sure , the 1925 Lon Chaney version is excellent ; but it's dated . When you consider that it was made nearly 80 years ago , though , that is to be expected . This version isn't a truly satisfying version either ; it's not bad , but considering how amazing it's source story is ; it's certainly not great . The main problem with this film is that it's perspective is wrong . There's far too much emphasis on the music side of the story , and the much more interesting element of the tragedy of the phantom's fate and his resulting obsession with the opera singer are left by the wayside , almost a co-star in their own film . I'm really sorry , but I have an acute dislike for opera music . Quite frankly ; it's awful . Operatic vocals can be good if given the right music to go with ( e . g . Nightwish ) , but on their own or with classical music , they're more painful than pulling your toenails out with pliers ( not that I've ever pulled my toenails out with pliers , of course , but I'm imagining it is ) . Of course , in Phantom of the Opera , you have to expect SOME opera , but at the end of the day ; this is a horror film , and as it has more opera music than horror ; it's safe to say that it's got it's perspective wrong . The film also seems keen to have moments of comedy in it , which works sometimes ; but more often than not feels like an awkward addition to the film . Another disappointment is the ending ; gone is the lavish and expansive ending that we were treated to in the 1925 version , and we have to make do with a very small , unsatisfying climax . Which pretty much sums up the film's relationship with its title character , actually . On the good side , this film has some nice elements ; the sets are grand and lavish , and overall very refreshing and a treat for the eyes . The film also looks very nice on the whole , especially when you consider that it's over sixty years old . The direction is assured , if not overly brilliant and the performances range from good enough , to very good ; with the excellent Claude Rains being at the business end of that statement . Ten years prior to this film , Rains carried a movie with his voice alone in The Invisible Man , but here we get the voice and the screen presence of a man who is undoubtedly one of the finest actors to ever grace the screen . If you're a fan of Phantom of the Opera , then this adaptation may well be to your liking . If your not , but want to see a film version of it , then I recommend starting with Lon Chaney's version . It's better .
423867	2248099	109809	5.0	Dull zombie tedium	Well , you can't expect anything original from a film like this , so I didn't . I just wanted a fun zombie flick that would entertain me for its duration and nothing more . Did I get it ? No , because Flesheater features a serious lack of interesting scenes , and the way that it plays out with barely a lick of humour means that it isn't much fun either . Obviously the main inspirations for this film are George Romero's classic zombie flicks ; principally Dawn of the Dead , but there's clearly things lifted from other entries in the series ; not to give anything away , but the ending is a direct lift from Romero . As you can imagine , there is very little in the way of plot and the film is mostly made up of zombies eating people ; which is OK , but really it needs some sort of story to go with it , or at least something else to keep the audience interested . The film starts by focusing on a group of kids who comes across the grave of an old man . It's not long before he comes back as the flesh eating living dead , and after some of the kids are bitten , things start to get out of control . Considering there's not really a plot , you have to expect some decent gore . . . but Flesheaters even disappoints on that front . There's a fair amount of gore in this film , and it's not badly done ; but it's boring and unimaginative , which fits the rest of the film but doesn't do anything for Flesheaters ' credibility ! Many post-Romero zombie flicks feature some sort of tribute to the master , often ham fisted stuff like calling a character " Romero " , but this film goes a step further and not only does it cast Bill Hinzman - the first zombie from Night of the Living Dead - he's cast in a pivotal role ! They might as well have just slapped a big banner over the cover saying " Romero Rip-Off " and had done with it ! Most of the film takes place in a country setting , which is probably a result of the crew not being able to find a better place to film . . . still , it's one of the better things about this film . The film just kind of drones on for most of the duration - if you thought zombie flesh eating couldn't be boring , you'll reconsider after this . The ending is a real none-event too ; overall , I'd recommend skipping this one !
423403	2248099	337921	6.0	Aren't mobile phones BRILLIANT ?	Aren't mobile phones brilliant ? I mean , there's just so much you can do with them . You can ring people , text people , play games , connect to other devices via bluetooth , send pictures and videos to people , solve crimes . . . yes , that's right ! The latest mobile function is the ability to solve crimes . Not directly , of course , but as Cellular shows ; mobile phone technology can be adapted in all sorts of ways in order to thwart the bad guys . Aside from being an exciting , if really silly thriller ; Cellular is also a ninety minute mobile phone advert , with much of the action focusing on the problems with mobile phones ( battery , connection etc ) and the Nokia logo on the front of the most-used one . Mobile phones have pretty much become a part of modern society ; so I guess it's only fair that they get their own tribute movie . The plot follows a woman who is kidnapped , seemingly for no reason , by a bunch of nasty looking blokes . Not content to just sit there and wait to be rescued , our heroine decides to get her own back on the kidnappers by phoning mobiles and running them up a big bill . She connects to a fun-loving surfer type , who agrees to spend his afternoon trying to save her . Cellular is quite clearly aimed at the MTv , mobile phone-loving audience ; and this is shown by the huge amount of plot inconsistencies . These range from the small things , such as the gold fish that survives five minutes plus out of water , down to the bigger lapses of logic , like the fact that mobile phones cant get a connection if they're upstairs in the local police station . However , despite being really silly ; Cellular offers a good time to it's audience , and if you can turn off to the lack of logic ; I'm sure that you'll enjoy this film . Cellular benefits from a good cast that includes Kim Basinger as the hostage , and Chris Evens ( unfortunately not THE Chris Evens ) as the unfortunate mobile phone owner . Jason Statham joins in the fun and impresses in the role of the nasty leader of the kidnappers , and William H . Macey completes the line-up as the unlikely police hero . The cast all seem to know how silly the film is ; but like the audience , have a good time regardless . This is just the sort of film that will be forgotten quickly , but as far as forgettable , silly films go ; you could do a lot worse than Cellular .
423333	2248099	330691	6.0	Hugely disappointing thriller from Argento	Dario Argento is my all time favourite director . Upon the release of this film , I choose to try and ignore the negative comments surrounding it as much as possible , mostly because I didn't want them to be true . Although the film isn't as bad as I thought it could be judging from the comments I've heard , it's not very good either ; and it's a far cry from the director's best works , such as ' Profondo Rosso ' or ' Tenebre ' . The film primarily lacks the elements that make Argento great - there isn't a lot of inventiveness on display , the score isn't up to the high standard that Goblin set and , most notably , there's only one real death scene in the film . And when you consider the body count of the rest of Argento's oeuvre ; that's pretty meagre . It's a shame because the idea behind the plot isn't bad , and you can definitely see why Argento thought this would make a good movie . We follow policewoman Anna Mari , as she tries to stop the local madman ( who's calling himself ' TheCardPlayer ' ) murdering women by playing a game of poker with him for their lives . Oh , and Argento shows that he's moving with the times by placing the game online , and having the murders happen on webcam . The lead actress doesn't carry the film with the usual panache that we've come to expect from the Argento protagonist . Her acting is mostly terrible , and her character isn't much better . Furthermore , much of the violence isn't shown on screen and we're either given an obscure view , or simply nothing at all ; and considering that gore is Argento's trademark , this isn't good at all . There are two murders that are shown on screen , and although one of them is up there with Argento's best in terms of style , the other is really lacking . The film does feature several good ideas , but many of these are poorly executed and for every good idea in the film , there's at least two bad ones . In my opinion , this film would have been ten times better if Argento had discarded the webcam idea and gone for a standard game of poker . Although the webcam presents a degree of claustrophobia and it's good because we can clearly see the victim's suffering , it's a bad idea because we hardly get to see anything when they're murdered , and it looks very cheap indeed . The poker scenes themselves are suspenseful in spite of the fact that we don't care for the characters ; but most of the tension is diffused by the way that Argento loads the scenes with far too much screaming ! Giallo isn't well known for making complete sense , and this film certainly doesn't . When the murderer is finally unmasked , it's hugely disappointing and we don't really care anyway as we haven't been able to identify with him due to the fact that we never see him doing the murders . Argento has also taken more than a little bit of influence from his own film - Bird With the Crystal Plumage - regarding the way that the murderer is found out as well . And that pretty much sums this up - a weak retread of what used to make Argento great . After he followed up his disappointing 1990's with the magnificent ' Sleepless ' , this Argento fan thought the master director was finally back on track . Judging by this ; he isn't .
422357	2248099	122629	6.0	Some good ideas in a rather dull film	This film is often considered to be a rip off of The Omen and / or Rosemary's Baby ; however , I think it's unfair to label it as such as while it does focus on similar themes and both films may well have been an influence ; if you were to consider this film a rip off , then you'd pretty much have to consider every film about the birth of the anti-Christ to be a rip off of The Omen and / or Rosemary's Baby . That being said , I don't want to give Damned in Venice too much credit ; as while it has some ideas of it's own , they're mostly not very good ones ! As the title suggests , the film is set in Venice ; although this doesn't really have a lot of influence on the plot , but it is always a nice setting . The film focuses on Mark ; a blind boy who begins having strange visions that seem to point to a looming disaster . Naturally , nobody believes him ; including his sister who also happens to be his carer . Even when people start dying the kid is not believed , but things take a turn for the worse again when the man from his visions turns up and impregnates his sister . . . This film features a very odd brother and sister relationship , which is even worse considering the brother is blind . The brother is extremely vulnerable , and the sister ( his carer ) not only seems not to care , but it appears as if just spending time in the same room with this poor kid is a chore ! Not that I can blame her though . . . he is seriously irritating . Some of the acting actually isn't bad ; but the film does really suffer from some extremely poor dubbing . The brother and sister's voices especially are very irritating and it makes them difficult to care about . The main problem with the film is that it's rather boring . There certainly are some good ideas on display , but it's just too slow and the first hour especially is boring . Thankfully , the film starts to pick up a bit in the final third ; although by then it is just a tad too late . We do get treated to a few good death scenes , however ( one in particular that really stands out ) and the final twist is fairly clever . Overall , this is not a great film by any means ; it has a few good moments but not enough to warrant tracking it down .
423095	2248099	303397	6.0	An interesting idea	This film , that received an incognito release back in 2001 , isn't actually as good as it's minor cult following would suggest . That's not to say that it isn't good , however ; it's refreshing to see something a little different and although the film is flawed , it does succeed for that reason . The story follows a reclusive man that lives in the woods and witnesses a murder while searching for his cat . The film doesn't have any dialogue , and is told in chapters . This makes the film different from the outset as it leaves the audience with only their own thoughts as to what's going and nothing is ever really explained . Other films , such as the worst film ever made ; The Blair Witch Project , have tried similar ways of developing a plot and most have failed . This one doesn't really succeed , but it's probably the best example I've seen yet . The film is almost completely set in the woods , and there aren't many people other than our central character shown on screen . This gives the film an intense feeling of loneliness and isolation , which is always unsettling . The film also seems to have taken some influence from true cult classic ' The Evil Dead ' in the way it is shot . The way that the camera moves through the woods is reminiscent of the ' Raimi-cam ' that was introduced in said movie . In spite of having no dialogue , and moving relatively slowly ; Soft for Digging never becomes boring and the scenes where we are allowed to brood with the main character are kept alive by what the audience thinks as we see him trying to continue with his life . The film features some very unnerving nightmare sequences , which are the movie's best moments and also come as something as a surprise in a movie of this nature . Nothing , however , can prepare you for the ending , which is as ambiguous as it is disgraceful and I almost guarantee that it will shock , repulse and surprise you . There's not really enough of this film , and what there is isn't really good enough to call it ' good ' without lying . However , this is an impressive first feature from director J . T . Petty and I look forward to seeing better things from him in the future .
423164	2248099	96046	6.0	Low key , but creepy little horror flick	Scarecrows shows what you can do with a very flimsy plot line and a low budget . Rather than concentrate on characters or story , the film leans more towards aesthetics ; as the tale is portrayed within a very creepy atmosphere , and the central monsters of the title capitalise well on their natural scare factor . Like clowns , scarecrows are eerie creations and it's clear that director William Wesley knows that , as their dark and foreboding image makes up the backbone of this tale of terror . The only real theme that is put on display in this film comes from the idea of greed , as it is that very thing that gets all the central protagonists into life-threatening danger . The film follows a bunch of soldiers that have stolen a lot of money . They take a pilot and his daughter hostage and force the pair to take them to Mexico ; but the ride has a hitch when one of the crooks decides that he doesn't want to share the money , and parachutes out of the plane with the loot . His partners in crime are soon on his tail , but the story has another twist when it turns out that the field they've jumped into is infested with scarecrows that want to do more than keep the birds off the crops ! This film isn't very well known and it's not hard to see why . Scarecrows is very short , running at about seventy minutes when you don't include the credit sequences . The film also feels very low-key , as the focus is more on the atmosphere than anything else , which can leave the film lacking at several intervals . Scarecrows is basically a glorified zombie movie , and pretty much plays out like one as the characters are picked off by their unworldly adversaries . The fact that the entire film takes place in what appears to be real time and in only one location ensures that it benefits from a claustrophobic tension , which benefits a film like this greatly . There isn't a lot of gore here , as the killings don't tend to be very bloodthirsty , and most of the violence takes place off-screen . The killings aren't bad , however , and I was impressed with the way that the film handled the scarecrows ' victims after they had been savaged . Overall , this film certainly won't win any awards , and you won't really be missing much by not seeing it ; but any horror fan that gets the chance to see Scarecrows probably won't be disappointed .
423884	2248099	95941	6.0	Absurd sick comedy	Lucio Fulci is one of the leading names in gore-soaked horror cinema , and Touch of Death certainly does that reputation proud ! Fulci's films started to get worse as his career progressed ( with the exception of the hilarious Cat in the Brain in 1990 ) , and as this film was released in 1988 ; you can count on it not being as good as his previous output . In fact , with films like Don't Torture a Duckling and The Beyond in mind ; Touch of Death is one of Fulci's weaker efforts , but even so - there's plenty here to delight the man's fans . The film is clearly meant to be something of comedy , but the comedy is more of the absurd , over the top variety than one that will have you in stitches . Fulci's use of music helps to instill the absurdity of the film , which sees lonely widower / gigolo Lester Parson taking women home and putting them to use . He likes to mutilate them in horrible ways , such as beating them with a stick and chopping them up with a chainsaw ; and just to add to the proceedings , he eats them too . Fulci also installs a subplot about the investigation into the murders , and the murderer's descent into madness . This film is something a prelude to Cat in the Brain , and it's obvious that Fulci had Touch of Death in mind when he made his self-starring vehicle , as many of the gore scenes from that film are taken from this one . The scenes of gore are really quite nasty , but their impact is lessened by the comic tone . The first scene of gore sees our ' hero ' going to work with a chainsaw ( surely horror cinema's finest weapon ) , and then putting the remains of his victim into a meat grinder . Then we are treated to a beating scene ( which features some of Fulci's trademark eye violence ) , a nasty sequence involving a car , a corpse having it's feet cut off and several other scenes along the same line . The film is really dirty ; with the poor cinematography adding brilliantly to the overall unclean feel of the movie . The acting is typically low level , but the actors portray their ( mostly silly ) characters with gusto , and the result is a film that people will like more it's fun value than its credibility . Being a Fulci fan , I am more susceptible to this sort of trash ; and I cant really say that non-Fulci fans will get much of a kick out of it .
423438	2248099	69715	6.0	And it's a shame that this isn't very good !	This period horror movie has all the right ingredients to be a success . It's got atmosphere , nice sets , Peter Cushing , an experienced horror director , a severed hand with a mind of it's own . . . but despite all this , it just doesn't work as it should . The principle reason for this is the plotting . It's slow , very slow , and there aren't a lot of things going on in the film . In fact , the film is so slow that even when there is something going on ; it feels like there isn't , and this doesn't do the film any favours at all , as it feels like you're stuck in a time warp while watching it . It's a shame this isn't very good , as the cast and crew are experienced in the horror genre , and these guys together should have ensured a better film . I mean , we've got one of the legends of the genre ; Peter Cushing , along with two of the smaller stars ; Patrick Magee and Herbert Lom , and these guys are directed by one of Hammer Horror's big guns : Roy Ward Baker . How could the resulting movie end up so tragically miserable ? You wouldn't think it could , but it did . The plot follows a house that is under a curse due to some wrongdoing in the past . When the master of the house moves his virgin bride in , she starts experiencing various forms of horror . Like ghosts , severed hands , pregnancy . . . stuff like that . The first half of the movie is dismal ; hardly anything happens , and the stuff that does isn't very interesting . Thankfully for the movie - and the audience - things pick up in the second half when a silly haircut wearing Peter Cushing enters the fray . He doesn't inspire the plot to do anything exciting and / or interesting really , but his screen presence is vast and it's hard to be bored when he's on screen , even if the rest of the movie sucks . The atmosphere and the sets are nicely done however , and this ensures that the dull plot has a nice area to inhabit . It's something of a waste , though , as a better story could easily have moulded around this setting ; but at least the movie has some good points . None of the credible actors impress really , and it's more than evident that Cushing is on autopilot . But then again , that's all he needs to be on . If you have a desire to see every horror film ever made , I recommend this movie . Otherwise , it's maybe best to skip it .
423768	2248099	60616	6.0	As the title suggests , it's murders at a clinic !	Murder Clinic is one of the lesser known Giallo's that has yet to be brought into the spotlight like many of the better examples of the genre have been already . In my opinion , this is a film that will never get the shiny DVD release ; and the reason for that is simply that it's not all that good . That's not to say that it's a terrible film ; clearly director Elio Scardamaglia has an eye for Gothic visuals ; the sets and atmosphere bode well with the plot line and the film does emulate the classic Universal horror style very well . . . but there's really not enough of the film and what there is of the plot is very clichéd and since most people that bother to seek out this film will be hardened horror veterans ( like myself ) , no viewer of Murder Clinic is likely to find anything they haven't seen before . As the title suggests , the film focuses on murders at an English clinic and the story takes place in the 1870's . Basically , a bunch of the clinic's vulnerable residents are being picked off by a razor-wielding maniac and we get a handful of possible suspects . The plot actually doesn't play out too badly ; we get treated to a few murders before being introduced to the ' monster ' of the story and the back-story behind that monster ( which is actually fairly interesting but could and should have been handled in a much better way ) . However , the film does have a tendency to run into the melodramatic and while Elio Scardamaglia's direction is sound , the film was clearly shot on a low budget and he doesn't ever manage to make the film look anything more than a cheap affair ( although in fairness , the VHS copy I saw does the film no favours ) . The film only runs for about eighty minutes and that's a good thing to be honest as it definitely would have started to get boring if it were any longer ; although the runtime we do have only just keeps the film from becoming boring . The way that Murder Clinic handles red herrings is good and we get four main ones and to the film's credit , it's not immediately obvious who the killer is before it's revealed . Overall , this is not a great Giallo by any means and only hardcore genre fans should check it out ; but it's a decent watch at least .
422509	2248099	64096	6.0	Could have been interesting , but lacks focus	Death Knocks Twice is a somewhat interesting thriller that is often considered a part of the Giallo genre , despite putting much of its focus on other areas of the plot ; which shows in a nutshell just how meandering this film is considering that a murder plot makes up the backbone of it . The film was made in 1969 ; just before the Giallo genre would gain popularity and Italian directors would go into overdrive making them . This one was actually a co-production with West Germany ; thus further calling it's credibility with the genre into repute . The plot focuses on Francisco di Villaverde ; a talented artist who has a deadly hobby , which involves strangling girls after having sex with them . He strangles a girl on the beach and this is witnessed by a couple of body guards , who just so happen to work for a local gangster who just so happens to want to buy a piece of property owned by Francisco di Villaverde . This story is then fused with a love story between the artist and the gangster's wife as she can't resist his charms in spite of his murderous nature . The film gets off to a good start as we witness the central character murdering a woman on a beach . . . but from there it just peters out as we descend further into the plot . It loses focus as it goes on and the film quickly gets boring . In its favour , the film does have three of the best stars of Italian cinema in its cast list . A young Fabio Testi takes the lead role and hints at the kind of performance that the charismatic actor would go on to give . The beautiful Anita Ekberg also appears as does one of the most underrated actors of cult Italian cinema ; the excellent Adolfo Celi . The film is directed by Harald Philipp and while he does capture some nice looking locations ; his direction in general is nothing fascinating and certainly not a patch on the likes of Dario Argento who would go on to make some of the best films of the genre . It all boils down to a decent conclusion ; but by then I couldn't really care what happened to be honest which is a bit of a shame . This is not an easy film to come by and I don't see any reason why that would change as it's not a particularly memorable entry .
423738	2248099	79207	6.0	Grisly and sleazy - but not all that good	Anyone that knows anything about this film knows that it's grisly and sleazy - but to be honest , up until about the hour mark ; I feared that I may be in the wrong film . Don't get me wrong , I love a good slice of disgusting sleaze ; but not when the resulting film is boring . The first two thirds of the film focus mainly on sex and police procedure , with just a little blood thrown in for good measure . These sections of the film really drag , and don't give credence to the opening shot that sees a young man being repeatedly stabbed in the crotch . However , you've got to expect this sort of poor plot pacing from Eurotrash cinema , and to this film's credit - it gets a lot better as it goes on , as the death scenes get nastier and the plot gets more interesting . The first major plot point sees the police find the bodies of a young couple ; he has been stabbed to death , and she has drowned and then had her body taken out of the water . We then follow police inspector De Pol , as he questions several people , some of which turn up dead themselves . The two sides of the plot ; those being the murders and the resulting investigation , don't bode well at all - and Giallo a Venezia feels very disjointed as neither one compliments the other , meaning that the film isn't very thrilling overall . By keeping the focus on the unpleasantness and sleaze , however , director Mario Landi makes sure that it's always obvious exactly what the point of the film is . Indeed , even the usually beautiful Venetian canals look sordid in this film , and while that helps the look and feel of the film ; it doesn't do much for the aesthetics . Jeff Blynn is ineffective in the lead role , and looks like he accidentally stepped off the set of Starsky and Hutch . The violence is extremely misogynistic , and almost every woman in the film ends up being violated in some way . The scenes of gore are mostly good , and see such delights as a man being shot and set on fire and the butchery of a woman on a table , who promptly turns up inside a refrigerator ! The conclusion to the film is the best element , and Mario Landi somehow managed to make this messy sleaze flick make sense . Overall , I can't say that Giallo a Venezia is one of the best Giallo's I've seen ( not by a mile ) ; but it has its positives elements and may delight fans of morbid sleaze .
423004	2248099	257516	6.0	Not quite as bad as you've heard	A good werewolf movie is a rare thing . In fact , there have only been a handful of good werewolf movies , ever , and unfortunately ; Wes Craven's effort doesn't do anything to change that . This film has been universally lambasted on all fronts , and while it's clear why it has been greeted by the reaction it's got ; it's also hard to rate this as a complete failure . There are several amazingly stupid moments in this film , and there's at least as many laughable lines ; but if you can look past that , and the sizeable amount of teen flick clichés that this film seems all too keen to incorporate , what we have here is a decent take on the werewolf legend . Kevin Williamson had one success with the surprisingly good ' Scream ' , and everything else since then has been poor in the extreme . This film doesn't represent anything near a success for him , and if it weren't for the fact that the werewolf legend itself is intriguing ; this film would have been a complete failure . One good thing about his script is that it doesn't try to change the legend . He sticks to the common werewolf story , and that's what I liked best about this film . Christina Ricci isn't great at deciding which films to star in , but you can always count on a standout performance from her . Her acting isn't great in this flick , but with her big eyes and long dark hair , she makes all of her scenes a delight . The rest of the cast aren't worth mentioning , as Craven seems to have picked them all up from the set of one of those dull TV shows that Americans make . It doesn't matter , though , because this isn't an actor's film anyway . The special effects are a big reason why so many werewolf films fail , and this one has gone for the lazy CGI angle . The change sequences are terrible and pale in comparison to the likes of An American Werewolf in London and The Howling , both 25 years Cursed's senior . Too many ideas in this film - the whole ' gay ' thing especially - are just stupid and even when you consider that Williamson was probably trying to cash in on the success of slasher spoof ' Scream ' , it's still easy to cringe through them . The first twenty minutes set the film up like it's going to be a lot better than it is . Still , if you don't go in expecting too much ; Cursed isn't too bad a way to spend ninety minutes .
422624	2248099	478988	6.0	Nice gimmick , but it can't completely carry the film	This isn't the first movie to be made recently despite the fact that it utilises classic silent movie methods . Dracula : Pages From a Virgin's Diary is the only other one I've seen , but I'm sure there's more besides . This adaptation of H . P . Lovecraft's classic story , The Call of Cthulhu is more faithful to the original works of the great writer than the likes of films such as Re-Animator and From Beyond ; but cinematically , it just doesn't work as well . Don't get me wrong , I love many classic silent movies ; but Lovecraft's work is too inventive to really be given a good adaptation in this style . The film follows the story of a man searching for a diabolical cult that worships the god ' Cthulhu ' . The majority of the film , therefore , follows a man reading up on the cult , and it isn't until the end , when the god finally turns up , that the film really becomes exciting . I respect The H . P . Lovecraft Historical Society immensely for having the drive to put this film together , as any kind of innovation in the modern horror genre is to be welcomed with open arms , but it's clear that the filmmakers didn't have enough budget , and the silent movie gimmick isn't enough to keep the entire film interesting - even if it is only 47 minutes long . This story would be better served with a modern adaptation , and I'm pleased to say that it's getting one in 2006 . On the whole , this silent version is worth watching due to the fact that it's tried to do something different and adapt the master's work ' faithfully ' - but it's not a great film .
422190	2248099	67367	6.0	Left me with a lust to see a better Hammer film	Lust for a Vampire is one of Hammer's lesser known films , and that's hardly surprising as none of their A-list stars were involved in it . Even so , this film actually features one of the more interesting vampire plots that the studio had to offer , although it has to be said that it isn't executed as well as it could have been . The film starts off slowly , and despite a brief period of interest around halfway through ? Lust for a Vampire is never overly exciting , and too much focus is put on mildly sensuous tones of the vampires ' lusts . It's clear that Hammer were being heavily influenced by the trashy films coming out of Europe by the seventies , and that's a shame as sex was never Hammer's strongpoint . The plot is something of a mess , and focuses on the common vampire theme of someone being resurrected . In this case it's Mircalla , formerly known as Carmilla ; a beautiful vampire countess . The home of the vampires is conveniently located right next to a finishing school , which just happens to be populated by beautiful buxom bisexuals with huge breasts , and teachers with a fascination for vampirism . The IMDb trivia section sheds some light on this production - the great combination of Terence Fisher and Peter Cushing had to drop out , and Ralph Bates and Jimmy Sangster were brought in at short notice . While Sangster is a capable director , and Bates has provided some great supporting turns for Hammer ; neither is up to the standard of the pair that dropped out . Ralph Bates does the steal the show , however , with by far the most memorable performance of the film . Yutte Stensgaard takes the female lead , and impresses constantly with her body and angelic good looks . The locations used are generally of a high standard and provide a good Gothic atmosphere for the film to bathe in . . . but all this style isn't enough . There's a complete lack of tension and the plot isn't intriguing enough to draw the audience into the film . The finishing touch is the rubbish Mike Raven performance , which just made me wish for Christopher Lee . This is part of a trilogy of films from Hammer studios that revolve around the Karnstein's , and it's by far the weakest . Not a patch on the great Twins of Evil or the good Vampire Lovers ; Lust for a Vampire is just about worth watching , but I wouldn't make it a priority .
422172	2248099	35937	6.0	Not Lewton's best film , but a good exhibition of eerie atmosphere	The Ghost Ship was put together because RKO pictures wanted another film to be made using the existing sets from their earlier film , Pacific Liner . This shows somewhat , as the film has something of a rushed and unfinished feel to it ; but there's nobody better than Val Lewton for the task of putting together an eerie thriller , and considering the reasons why this was made ; he hasn't done a bad job at all . The film isn't up there with his best work - films such as Cat People , I Walked With a Zombie and The Body Snatcher - but I still rate this as a successful production credit for the man , and as an eerie sea bound thriller ; it definitely works . The plot is simple ( probably as a result of the reason that the film was made ) and it follows a ship whose third mate suspects that the captain may be the one murdering the crew , some members of which have been dying under mysterious circumstances . We then follow a familiar psychological drama formula , which is fleshed out by some set pieces typical of Lewton's films . The atmosphere , as usual with Lewton , is right on cue and makes up the backbone of the movie . The smoky setting compliments the isolation of being at sea nicely , and the film always seems interesting and foreboding for this reason . The story is weak and somewhat dull for the first half hour of the movie - and this is somewhat due to the lack in atmosphere . The first half does treat us to the film's best set-piece - a man being crushed by a huge chain ( no less ! ) - but you'll have to wait until the second half before the movie really picks up . As you would expect from Lewton , the film is never gratuitous , but during the second half the story starts to pick up , and as the tension mounts , director Mark Robson allows the film to reach it's climatic conclusion . Mark Robson isn't the best director that Lewton worked with - and all of his movies have been lesser entries in the great producer's list of film credits , but he knows what he's doing and this is another decent film from him . On the whole - you'll probably want to see the Jacques Tourneur collaborations , along with The Body Snatcher first - but after you've seen those , this is a good place to go next .
421751	2248099	82083	6.0	Crappy , but fun eighties horror flick !	Believe it or not , Blood Beach actually surpassed my expectations . Of course , I didn't go into the film expecting a masterpiece ; but I decided if it was half as fun as the other beach related John Saxon film that I've seen ( Umberto's Lenzi's Nightmare Beach ) , then I'd be happy . Despite being a schlocky eighties mess of a movie , Blood Beach is a lot of fun to watch and the idea of monsters living underneath the sand of a local tourist beach is fairly original . The film takes more than its fair share of influence from the classic film Jaws , and I was actually surprised that it wasn't produced in Italy - given how adept the Italians are at making Jaws rip-offs . As mentioned , the plot focuses on a tourist beach , except this time the danger isn't in the water but in the sand . After several people disappear into the sand , it is up to the local law enforcement to keep people off the beach . There's also a rather superfluous sub-plot about a couple of long-lost lovers bumping into each other and rekindling their relationship . . . but you've got to expect a bit of filler with a plot this thin ! The film's main asset is undoubtedly the fact that it features a performance from prolific cult actor John Saxon . Unfortunately , Saxon isn't the star of the show , but he makes his presence felt in every scene he's in . The main roles go to David Huffman and Marianna Hill , and while neither impresses ; their performances at least fit with the film . The main reason why this film fails as a ' good ' horror film is down to the plotting - it's never really all that interesting , and it seems obvious that writer-director Jeffrey Bloom knows this as he continually throws in yet another sand death scene every time things are getting boring . Unlike a lot of eighties horror ; this one is practically bloodless , and while I'm not a big fan of that fan of that fact ; I have to respect the film somewhat for not throwing in a bucket of gore , which wouldn't have fit with the tone and theme of the movie . The ending doesn't really resolve much , and while the conclusion is typical of this sort of film ; it does at least work fairly well . Overall , Blood Beach is hardly a must see film - but it's certainly worth seeing if you manage to get your hands on a copy .
423350	2248099	79737	6.0	Decent enough sleaze , but could have been better .	I have to say I'm more than a little bit disappointed with this film . It's not that The Pleasure Shop on 7th Avenue is particularly bad for what it is , or that I was expecting it to be brilliant . . . but somehow , this just feels a bit too empty to be a film from the often proclaimed ' king of sleaze ' , Joe D'Amato . The film starts off well , with two would be robbers holding up a chemist , before finding out that it's under the protection of the local mob boss and scampering out the back door . The shenanigans continue when the bumbling thieves happen upon a porn shop being run by the mob boss ' girlfriend ! They then take her captive and make their way to Canada in order to escape the mob . The problem with this plot is that D'Amato doesn't take any advantage of the opportunities for a good thriller , or for humour and instead ; we get a barrage of sleaze and nudity , which is OK , but the film could have had so much more if D'Amato had been thinking outside the box . The sleaze on display isn't the most shocking Joe D'Amato fans will have seen from him , but there's a lot of stuff that is bound to please anyone with a mind to see this film . The Pleasure Shop on 7th Avenue isn't easy to track down , and I can't really recommend going out of your way as there are better trashy exploitation films out there ? . but of course , there's also a lot worse .
422446	2248099	71120	6.0	Decent seventies made for TV movie	All the Kind Strangers is basically just your average made for TV seventies movie - in that it features an interesting base plot , and lets that fill the entire runtime without even attempting to do anything else with it . The result is adequate ; though underwhelming . The film begins with a man driving through the woods alone . He encounters a young boy and offers to give him a lift home . Upon arriving at the boy's home , the man finds it inhabited by children ; and because his car won't start , he decides to stay there for the night . However , it turns out that the kids have broken his car to make him stay with them as they want him to be their father . The film only runs for about seventy five minutes and doesn't provide a great deal of surprises along the way . Once the plot is laid out , we are left only with the task of getting to the end . The film does feature a good leading performance from Stacy Keach , who gets into his character well and receives good feedback from the likes of Samantha Eggar and John Savage . It all boils down to a rather strange , yet disappointing ending . Overall , this is a long way from being great ; but it passes the time at least and I'd say it's just about worth a look .
423178	2248099	87759	7.0	Flashdancing Death	Lucio Fulci's Murder Rock is often lambasted by both Fulci and Giallo fans ; and although I can certainly see why , I've got to say that this film satisfied me personally and I won't hesitate to label it a successful attempt at blending the tacky eighties styling's of dance phenomenon's the likes of ' Flashdance ' with the familiar styling's of the popular Italian Giallo . I'm sure Fulci thought he was on to a definite winner back in 1984 with all these popular elements in one film ; and even though I'm not sure how they would have been received at the time , nowadays it stands up as an amusing slice of kitsch nostalgia . I think the director cared more about making a quick buck on this film than providing the mass with a piece of art , and this shines through in the convoluted , but not well put together plot line . As you might expect , the film centres on a dance academy . After one of the girls is found dead , the cops place everyone at the academy under suspicion and when the murders continue ; the police are given more leads to eventually track down the perpetrator . The main reason why this film isn't liked by many of my fellow Fulci fanatics is due to the fact that it's relatively bloodless in comparison to his other works . The likes of The New York Ripper and The Beyond show the director at his gritty , blood-dripping best . . . whereas the kill scenes in this movie hardly feature any of the red stuff . That being said , they are still rather sadistic , as the killer knocks his victim out with chloroform before puncturing their heart with , of all things , a hat pin . Still , it has nothing on the eyeball violence of Zombie Flesh-Eaters . The musical numbers are atrocious in true eighties pop style , while the dance scenes are rather boring and not what I tuned in for . Fulci does find time to implement some gorgeous visuals , and the blue tint that accompanies most scenes gives the film a certain sense of art . Even though many of the film's elements are not brilliant , I still rate this film as an overall success as it's entertaining and fun to watch , and even though there are too many filler scenes ; the plot plays out nicely . It's not a major highlight either for the genre or for the director , but Murder Rock is still worth seeing .
423456	2248099	91671	7.0	Definitely one of the best horror omnibus films	Horror omnibuses have been around in one way or another pretty much since the great Mario Bava rejuvenated them in 1963 with the awesome Black Sabbath . They often vary in quality , and many are brought down by weak links ; this one , however , doesn't suffer from any weak stories . Obviously , some are better than others ; but all in all , I don't hesitate to call this one of the best horror omnibuses that I've seen . From a Whisper to a Scream is most notable for the fact that it is Vincent Price's last ever ' pure ' horror movie . It's a shame to see the great master during his swansong to the genre that made him ; but on the other hand , this role really shows Price's talent as , despite being only a small part , he really makes the best of it . The plot concerns a small town called Oldfield . After the electrocution of his niece , librarian Julian White ( Price ) tells a reporter about the horrible incidents that have occurred in the town . The first tale is the weakest of the bunch - but it still has it's moments . Clu Gulager is creepy throughout , and the themes that it handles are quite frightening . Speaking of frightening - check out that tale's climax ! Anyway , tale one is just a warm up , really . . . Tale two is the highlight for yours truly . I love it when an omnibus flick produces a tale worth remembering - and this tale certainly is ! It works from more than just visual horror , and when you think about the potency of the ending - this one really hits home . Nice message , too . Not far behind in terms of quality is tale three . This is the typical eighties story of the bunch , and a lot of the reason it works is courtesy of the gruesome special effects . This one also generates intrigue from it's story , however , and cant be seen as merely an excuse to show some blood and guts . The last tale of the quartet is the most psychological of the bunch , and it follows the fortunes of three civil war soldiers that are ' kidnapped ' by a bunch of children ! This one went on a little bit too long for my liking , but the ideas behind it are good and the way that we see the soldiers being dominated by the evil children is quite surreal . It's obvious that writer-director respects the fact that he's managed to get one of the all-time greatest horror actors in the film by the way that the wraparound story is handled . Usually , this part of the film lets it down because it hasn't been very well thought out - but the one in this film is completely the opposite and actually makes the movie ! On the whole , this isn't a must see horror movie , but it's very good and I highly recommend it !
423423	2248099	78846	7.0	Not Meyer's best , but a decent little corny porn comedy	Russ Meyer's films may be silly and irreverent , but they're also great fun , and while Beneath the Valley of the Ultravixens is not his best work , it's still great fun to watch and certainly comes recommended to Meyer's fans ! In my opinion , Meyer is at his best when he's mixing comedy porn with a thriller plot structure - with Faster Pussycat ! Kill ! Kill ! and Supervixens being the best examples of his work . Beneath the Valley of the Ultravixens is basically your average porn movie with a focus on a load of set-piece situations , but Meyer keeps the laughs coming and there's no shortage of big breasted ladies to keep the audience interested . There isn't really much plot to speak of , but the film centres on Levonna & Lamar ; a couple in " Smalltown , USA " . They're having problems in ( you guessed it ) the bedroom , as Levonna wants to have sex normally , but Lamar only likes to go in through the backdoor . Levonna becomes frustrated , so she does what any woman would do - gets herself a wig , learns Spanish and pretends to be a Mexican dancer to try and change Lamar's sex preferences . . . The plot isn't really relied upon and the film is more of an excuse for Meyer to present a load of silly scenes ; but that isn't a problem . The situations that various characters find themselves in generally are funny - with the scenes that sees Levonna get her wig and Spanish phrase book , and a sequence taking place in a dentist's surgery being the highlights of the film . There's plenty of nudity as you might expect , and all the girls have overly inflated chests in the true Russ Meyer style . The sex is not exactly hardcore , but there's plenty of it and it's not disappointing . The style of the film seems to be a parody of the American " apple pie " theme and the story is told by a narrator , who seems to be taking on the role of the " all American workman " , the twist being that he's always talking about perversion . I don't think Russ Meyer was really trying to say anything with this film - there's a slight hint of a point stemming from the idea of " Smalltown , USA is a normal small town , but look what goes on behind closed doors ! " , but it's not implemented well enough to have much meaning . Overall , this is a very decent little porn flick from Russ Meyer , and while I'd recommend other films of his over this one ; Beneath the Valley of the Ultravixens is worth a watch .
422746	2248099	416449	7.0	History , comic book style !	It was obvious after the success of Sin City that we were going to see more of Frank Miller's graphic novels adapted for the screen , and someone was obviously impressed enough with Zack Snyder's visuals on the dire Dawn of the Dead remake to give him the directing reigns . I have to say , I'm not the biggest fan of period epics ; but I knew that wouldn't be a problem going into this film as Frank Miller obviously has a very over the top style , and as soon as I heard that it's " very gory " , I was sold . I have to say that this film is not as great as Sin City ; the visuals aren't as good , the film isn't handled as well and the central plot thread isn't as interesting as Sin City's three narratives ; but 300 is still a spectacular piece of cinema . The film focuses on the war between the Spartans and the Persians in 480 B . C . A group of 300 Spartans , lead by the fearless King Leonidas , moves in on the advancing Persian army . The warriors are massively outnumbered , but thanks to their impregnable strategy ; the few manage to out fight the many for a short time . I haven't read Frank Miller's graphic novel , but I'm guessing that certain sequences were based on it pretty much frame for frame . While this is good in some ways as it allows Snyder to capture the comic book style , in other ways it's very bad as some shots look completely out of place , and make it seem like Snyder doesn't really know what he's doing . There's no problem with post-production , however , as the cinematography is excellent and the way that the fight scenes are shot is good in that it allows them to be completely brutal , while never becoming completely exploitative . I read in British newspaper ' The Sun ' that 300 is ' the bloodiest movie in history ' , which of course isn't the case . There is a lot bloodshed , but it never really FEELS like there's a lot of bloodshed as the atmosphere is completely other-worldly . The way that Snyder uses his actors is good as the impressive Spartans add to the overall look of the film . The two central performances - those coming from Gerard Butler and the beautiful Lena Headey are both impressive , while the largely British support cast impress in their roles . Overall , this isn't a brilliant film as there are a lot of niggles ; but it has it's moments , and during the fight scenes ( which , thankfully , take up a large proportion of the film ) , you won't care about 300's shortfalls .
421701	2248099	430164	7.0	Very decent mystery flick from Álex de la Iglesia	The Baby's Room is Álex de la Iglesia's entry in the Spanish horror TV series " Films to keep you awake " . I saw Iglesia's cult hit ' Day of the Beast ' fairly recently and was thoroughly impressed by it . Obviously The Baby's Room is not of similar quality , but it's a more than interesting little story and better than the majority of the " Masters of Horror " episodes . If you were to pigeon hole this film , it would go into the ' haunted house ' genre , and although there's haunted house themes ; Iglesia makes more of it than just that . The plot focuses on a young couple with a baby that have just moved into a new home . After buying a baby monitor , the couple come to believe that somebody may be in the house with them ; but the truth is something far more sinister . As a mystery film , this one works well . I can't say that the plot is completely original ; though the film didn't turn out to be what I was expecting which is always a bonus . The central couple are both excellent , with Javier Gutiérrez particularly standing out . There are some good moments of suspense and the director does manage to keep us interested for the duration . It boils down to a decent twisted ending and I certainly recommend this film to anyone who can get their hands on it .
423694	2248099	148615	7.0	The sleaziest motel in cinema !	Play Motel is something of a cross between Giallo and your standard sleaze film ; as the common Giallo theme of sex is revved up , while the other staple of the genre ; namely , murder mystery , is pretty much forgotten about in favour of showing as much skin as possible . As you might expect given that premise , the sleaze factor is amazingly high , and director Mario Gariazzo appears to be trying to imitate the likes of Jess Franco with his sex-heavy plot line . The way that the actual plot is lost under all the skin is actually quite comical , as it's clearly there just to take advantage of the ( at the time ) popular Giallo sub-genre . But then again , you've got to expect that sort of thing from Italian filmmakers ! The plot focuses on a place called ' Play Motel ' . Sexual activity is rife there , but unfortunately for the guests ; Play Motel has a peeping tom on the premises , and he enjoys snapping pictures of love making couples and then blackmailing the wealthy victims with the threat of making the photographs public . We follow a half-assed investigation into the crimes . . . The film has something of a reputation among cult fans for being raunchy , but actually the sex is rather soft considering what can be viewed in similar films . That being said , the film is quite a long way away from being clean ; and we still get to see various taboos being broken . The music is what really makes this film what it is , as Play Motel features some of the most ridiculous sounds ever to grace a Giallo . The title song is hardly ' Hotel California ' , and the way some corny music comes on every time two people are about to get it on works well . Despite being trash , Play Motel actually features a rather decent cult cast . Ray Lovelock is the biggest name with regards to the actors , and he receives decent support from Antonio De Teffè , as well as buxom females such as Enzo Fisichella ( ' Big Alligator River ' ) , Patrizia Webley ( The Bloodsucker Leads the Dance ) and Marina Hedman ( Images in a Convent ) . The blackmail plot gets resolved at the end , although it's completely uninteresting . However , this film is really all about smut and sleaze ; and on that front , Play Motel certainly delivers !
421709	2248099	443543	7.0	Has holes , but a decent film nonetheless	Was it just a coincidence that two movies about magicians with a period setting were released within the space of a few months of each other ? I don't know , but needless to say this film is always going to find itself being compared with Christopher Nolan's ' The Prestige ' , and it's always going to find itself in second place because Nolan's film is a hell of a lot better than this one . The two films are similar in that they're both thrillers , both focus on retribution and , obviously , both are based on magicians . This one is based on a short story by Steven Millhauser and focuses on a man named Eisenheim . As a boy , Eisenheim falls in love with a girl a few social classes above himself , but their relationship is broken up for that very reason . Cut to years later and Eisenheim is a successful magician in Vienna . He meets his long lost love during a show and they quickly rekindle their relationship ; but being together is a problem as she is engaged to the Crown Prince . . . After rising to fame with the likes of American History X and Fight Club in the late 1990's , it has to be said that Edward Norton has been a bit of a disappointment ever since . He really was due a good performance , and while his role here isn't as great as the ones that made him famous in the first place ; he performs well and the film definitely represents his best work in years . Norton is given excellent support from the likes of Paul Giamatti , Rufus Sewell and Jessica Biel , and the acting is high quality on the whole . As mentioned , the film features a period setting and with the help of some glossy cinematography , it mostly looks very nice . The film is obviously intended to be a thriller , although there isn't a great deal of suspense featured . The plot does remain interesting for most of the duration , however , and there is usually just about enough going on to ensure that it doesn't become boring . The film builds up to a twist at the end . I didn't see it coming myself , though I'm sure many others will . However , in spite of this it is fairly well worked , although the audience is asked to suspend disbelief more than just a little . But even so , this is decent enough entertainment and I did at least enjoy it .
423676	2248099	82744	7.0	Highly entertaining eighties exploitation !	Midnight was released in 1982 , but it's every bit a seventies style backwoods exploitation flick ; and while the movie does feature a whole host of problems ; it makes for extremely fun viewing and the way that the plot moves ensures that the film never becomes boring . I'm a big fan of films like this because you can never really tell what's coming ; and while the plot of this film doesn't make logical progressions , it certainly does manage to keep the audience on the edge of their seats . The central plot focuses on a young girl named Nancy Johnson . Nancy has a ' bad experience ' with her stepfather - one that involves him groping her and her resisting his advances . She decides to flee her family home and hits the road where , after coming across one driver who wants to book a motel with her , she comes across two young lads in a van . They give her lift and convince her to travel with them to Florida ; but after a run in with the law , the trio find themselves out in the woods , where it just so happens that some murders have been committed . . . The film is directed by John A . Russo ; the man behind a handful of trashy exploitation flicks , as well as a writing credit for classic horror Night of the Living Dead . His writing and direction on this film is not brilliant ; but he does manage to pack a lot of different story elements into the film and he has succeeded in making it entertaining ; and you cant ask for much more than that from an eighties exploitation flick . It's clear that the director didn't have much of a budget to work with ; and the film does look very cheap , although this is repaid by a grubby and fetid atmosphere which really does the film a lot of favours . Midnight is thoroughly unpleasant throughout ( the soundtrack being the only exception ! ) and there's not one innocent character in it , which adds to the unpleasantness . The cast is nothing to write home about ; although cult cinema fans will no doubt recognise Lawrence Tierney as the amorous step dad . Overall , this film falls somewhat short of being a must see ; but it makes for a good watch and is a hell of a lot better than it's reputation suggests ! Recommended .
422259	2248099	71413	7.0	Psycho kids create gory death scenes	Devil Times Five is basically your basic seventies horror flick about a bunch of people in an isolated location being terrorised by psychos ; except this one has a twist , and that twist comes in the form of the psychos themselves being young children . The most famous film to use the idea of psychotic children is probably the 1960 classic Village of the Damned ; but it has been done many times since . Devil Times Five is perhaps something of an oddity within the genre as it doesn't particularly focus on the idea of the children being psychos , but instead puts its focus on the sleazy adult characters and gory death scenes . The plot focuses on a group of people staying at a snowbound lodge . Meanwhile , a bus carrying a group of psychotic children slips off the road ; allowing the kids to escape . After taking out their guardian , the kids descend on the lodge where they are taken in by the people staying there . Shortly thereafter , the adults start turning up dead . . . The film is a real piece of seventies grindhouse with the main focus being on the sleazy atmosphere . Immediately we are shown that not all of the main characters are angels and it sets things up nicely . Often horror films involving kids will be toned down a little ; but that's not the case here either . The kids themselves are vicious enough and that is complimented nicely by a grisly set of death scenes that include things such as a woman in a bath being eaten by piranhas , someone being set alight and a vast assortment of mêlée weapons being put to good use . The snow setting provides a good location for the action to take place as it provides a good atmosphere of isolation to ensure we're always aware that the central characters are in trouble . It does have to be said that the film can't really be taken seriously ; it's not particularly well written or acted and the story has no depth whatsoever - but it's not important anyway for a seventies horror flick and the film does provide ninety minutes that are worth seeing .
423212	2248099	64437	7.0	Good account of an actual crime	The Honeymoon Killers is based on the real-life story of the known facts about the case of Martha Beck and Raymond Fernandez . The film is shot in a documentary style , which proves an adequate base for the film to work from ; although it also makes the proceedings feel rather cold , and I have to say that I had a difficult time warming to the film . The idea of someone killing people he finds through a lonely heart club has been used numerous times in cinema , most notably in films such as ' Sea of Love ' , and I dare say that the inspiration for such films came from this real life case . The plot focuses on Martha Beck ; an overweight nurse who meets Raymond Fernandez through a lonely hearts column . He's used to scamming the women he picks up in this manner , but the pair hit it off and it's not long before Raymond decides to bring Martha in on the scam , and she poses as his sister . However , she becomes jealous of the women that Raymond is picking up , and the deceit eventually leads to murder when she can't cope with other women invading her and her lovers ' lives . The film was originally going to be directed by Martin Scorsese , but the popular director was eventually replaced by writer Leonard Kastle . Whether or not Scorsese would have done a better job is up for debate , but Kastle does an adequate job , although the black and white photography is largely pedestrian . He does , however , succeed in building up his characters , and it's the situation is always believable because of that . The director also does well at providing the film with a fitting fifties setting , and some of the scenes are rather shocking as they include things such as a mother being murdered in front of her son . The acting is good , and Shirley Stoler in particular stands out as the central female . This was her debut performance , yet she performs like an experienced actress . Stoler does well at commanding every scene she's in , although her opposite number ; Tony Lo Bianco , still manages a stand-out performance also . Overall , The Honeymoon Killers does well at providing a good account of an actual event ; but I hesitate to call it a classic simply because I found it difficult to get into .
423250	2248099	59710	7.0	Lovely adventure yarn from Hammer studios !	Hammer are famous for making horror movies ( obviously ) , and ' She ' is often considered amongst Hammer's horror offerings . I beg to differ from that notion , as although it certainly has horror elements : this is most definitely an adventure movie . Still , the delirious Hammer style is definitely still there and this movie succeeds in conforming to the camp ideals that Hammer became famous for ( and that I love them for ! ) . This is also one of many ( though not enough ! ) movies to feature the immense talents of both of Hammer's super-heavyweights ; Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee , and both deliver to their regular high standard . The plot follows three men who travel to a lost city in search of riches that have been promised to them upon their arrival . However , the city is ruled by the powerful ' She who must be obeyed ' ( Ursula Andress ) and she believes one of the men to be her reincarnated love , so sets about making him conform to her way of thinking . . . The film exudes a sense of sleaze , in spite of not being essentially sleazy . This has come about due to the central theme of the woman being the dominant party , and as the woman in question is played by the domineering Ursula Andress , that sense is exuded quite plainly . Also joining in the fun aside from Cushing , Lee and Andress is Hammer favourite André Morell , who completes a rather fine cast . The low budget is more than obvious on a number of occasions , mostly through the cheap looking sets , and it seems as if the producers have been a little over ambitious . It doesn't matter , though , as the low budget adds to the charm and appeal of the movie , which ensures that the movie is even more fun for the viewer . The moral to the story has some credibility too , and the ending actually succeeds in being fairly powerful . On the whole , ' She ' isn't a prime example of how great the adventure genre can be ; but it's a solid film , and fans of low budget kitsch will find something to like .
423364	2248099	71147	7.0	Not entirely successful , but Edwige delivers a great performance !	Secrets of a Call Girl is a rather odd Italian crime film as instead of focusing on the usual areas - shootings , car chases , fist fights etc , we focus on the hard done to girlfriend of a mobster ; Anna , played by Edwige Fenech . The film is , therefore , is something like a cross between a crime drama and a romantic drama and in my opinion , it doesn't quite gel together - but that's not to say that this isn't a good film . The title implies that this will be a ' confessional ' drama and implies that the central character is a prostitute , though that is somewhat misleading . As mentioned , the plot focuses on Anna ; a young girl who works in a café . She goes from rags to riches when she catches the eye of Guido ; an Italian mobster who takes her out of the café and into the gangster life . She soon realises that all that glitters is not gold when she witnesses a mob hit and the boss wants her silenced . Guido then decides to push her into prostitution , but when he is caught by the law ; she decides to escape him and makes a new life with her son and a doctor . Edwige Fenech takes the lead role and does brilliantly with it . Her role here requires her to a little more than just take her clothes off , and she rises to the occasion well . It's easy to forget that she can act considering her roles in many of her films , so Secrets of a Call Girl serves as a nice reminder ! The film also features performances from Corrado Pani , Richard Conte and John Richardson , who all do a good job in supporting roles . Giuliano Carnimeo takes the directors chair and does a good of directing Fenech for the second time , after The Case of the Bloody Iris . It has to be said that this film is more than a little slow at times , especially compared to other similar genre films owing to the fact that the focus is more on Fenech's character rather than the mob activities . However , this is not always a bad thing . I can't say that I'm a big fan of Romance films , but Fenech does enough to light up the screen every time she's on it and the film never becomes boring . It all boils down to a powerful ending that actually does have an impact . Overall , I'm not crazy about this film ; but it's a good entry into Fenech's resume and it gets my recommendation .
422556	2248099	36653	7.0	Atmospheric almost classic	Bluebeard is probably most notable for the fact that its lead star , John Carradine , famously named his role here as his favourite across his lengthy list of film credits . It's easy to see why the man himself enjoyed playing this part so much too - Carradine's role in Bluebeard allows him to act at his most sinister , and the film really depends on him as this is very much a one-man story . Carradine has just the right look for this sort of role also , and all these elements combine nicely to ensure that Carradine's part in this film is a success . The base for the plot is one of cinema's most common and most prolific , but this film is notable for being one of the earlier films to use it . We follow a deranged madman who likes to paint girl's pictures before he strangles them to death . The man himself is famous for two completely different lives ; in one , he is the notorious serial killer ' Bluebeard ' , who prays on beautiful young women - and in the other he's Gaston Morrell , a dapper up and coming young painter . This film's major problem is certainly not with the plot , stars , or style ; it's with the plotting . Bluebeard falls down primarily because it moves at snail pace . The plot is intriguing , but the way it presents itself is the opposite , and it's a shame because , if handled with care , this film could have been really good instead of just being good . Director Edgar G . Ulmer is most famous for his directing credit on classic film ' The Black Cat ' , and is lesser known for his set design on films such as Fritz Lang's Die Nibelungen , M and Metropolis ; as well as silent classics ; Sunrise and Der Golem . Ulmer's previous experience helps him with Bluebeard , as the film is constantly atmospheric , and the director makes best use of his simple sets by way of his use of the camera and the murky black and white cinematography . The film is very bleak throughout , and this massively helps the plot as it gives the film just the right amount of foreboding . Plots like this have been turned into better films since the release of this film over sixty years ago ; but Bluebeard is still well worth seeing . The film starts out slow , but it does pick up and not even an extremely overlong puppet sequence can fully degenerate the film into the realms of absolute boredom . It's not must see ; but worth seeing if the chance presents itself .
422726	2248099	90644	7.0	Not quite brilliant , but highly original and inventive	After seeing Anguish , I know it will stay in the memory a while as it's not quite like anything else I've seen . However , outside of the central gimmick ; there is unfortunately not a great deal to recommend it for . Bigas Luna's film is a horror movie within a horror movie , and as you can probably imagine from that description ; it's a completely bizarre and surreal film . The title ' Anguish ' seems to be a clue to the order of the day as both segments focus on putting the subjects in a state of anguish with a series of gripping occurrences . The film focuses on John Pressman ; an optician with an eye problem and a strange mother . After losing his job , he goes out on a killing spree under the direction of his mother who apparently is using some sort of hypnosis . The spree goes on for a short while and then the film takes a turn for the bizarre as the focus pans out and we find ourselves in a movie theatre with a group of people watching the film we've been watching ! However , it turns out all is not well there either , as one of the crowd is a maniacal killer . The main problem I have with this film is simply that while the central idea is very good , the two segments of the story are actually quite mundane . They're both just your average ' serial killer ' stories , albeit one featuring a great deal of eyeball violence . The director clearly wanted to excite his audience and get them on the edge of their seats , and while parts of the film are exciting - I didn't find myself in a state of anguish for the duration . I don't often find myself needing a particular point when it comes to serial killer flicks , but this film just feels a bit too intelligent not to have one . I can only assume that the director wanted to portray something along the lines of the idea that a potential killer could be influenced by what they are seeing on screen ; although it's never really brought across . Distinctive performers Michael Lerner and Zelda Rubinstein are the pick of the cast and provide memorable leads . The film does deserve a lot of respect for going out and trying to do something a bit different and even though it doesn't come off as well as it might have ; Anguish is still well worth seeing .
423064	2248099	110410	7.0	Not vintage Lovecraft , but a good film	Full Moon seem to have a rather poor reputation arising from the fact that many of their films are low budget and not exactly masterpieces , but the company certainly does well when it comes to H . P . Lovecraft , and while this film isn't up to the standard that Stuart Gordon went on to set with Castle Freak , Lurking Fear is still a good example of low budget horror . I've not read the Lovecraft short story that the film is based on , so I can't say how faithful to the original material it is ; but the film features a number of Lovecraft's trademarks , and the central theme of a town overrun by strange otherworldly creatures is pure Lovecraft . The plot centres on the town of Leffert's Corners , which as mentioned , has a problem with strange otherworldly creatures . A man named John Martense also has a problem also as his criminal father happened to bury a corpse in Leffert's Corners , which is filled with money ; and he isn't the only one that wants it . We then follow John Martense and a group of three would-be robbers who arrive at the town just as the locals are preparing a spectacular fight back . The main problem with this film really is that not enough happens . We focus on a claustrophobic church where the locals have holed up , and while the atmosphere is good and every now and then someone gets killed , the characters aren't interesting enough to pull it through as well as possible , and the creatures never take centre stage . But even so , I enjoyed this film as its PURE horror ; we don't get mixed up in any needless subplots , and director C . Courtney Joyner ( who has directed a slew of trashy horror flicks ) keeps the focus on the central theme well . The acting isn't up to much , but the cast just about pull it through . Jeffrey Combs is never far from H . P . Lovecraft , and I always enjoy seeing him in films . Hellraiser's Ashley Laurence makes a welcome appearance and is actually very sexy , while Allison Mackie does well as her opposite number . The film gets better as it goes along , and the director just about succeeds in building tension on the way to the ending , which wraps everything up nicely . Overall , this is not a great film and I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to see it ; but its fun enough and definitely worth watching .
423957	2248099	59465	7.0	A good slice of low budget Gothic	Die Monster Die may not be a major highlight for any of its major players , but even so ; this film represents an assured slice of Gothic horror and I can't find much to complain about . The film is based on the Lovecraft tale " The Colour out of Space " , and follows the common Lovecraft themes of mutated life forms and mysterious central characters . The film begins to build intrigue immediately as a young British man arrives in town with the intention of visiting his fiancé's estate . None of the locals are too happy about his presence ; especially when he tells them where he is going . This immediately gets the audience on the edge of their seats as the desire to find out just what has been going on at the mysterious mansion sets in . Director Daniel Haller continues to build the suspense when our central character gets to the mansion and we are introduced to Nahum Witley ; a wheelchair bound father that is also none too happy about the man's presence . From there , the film builds a scintillating Gothic atmosphere , and the locked greenhouse quickly becomes the focus of our attention . . . The only other film I've seen from director Daniel Haller ( who worked with Roger Corman on his classic Poe Anthology ) was The Dunwich Horror , which squandered its Lovecraft story thanks to some frankly boring plotting and an ending which succeeded in explaining next to nothing . Needless to say , this earlier film doesn't suffer from the same problem as there are bags of tension and intrigue , and the director doesn't hold back when it comes to letting the audience know the secret behind the central character's cagey nature . The special effects are good considering the time in which the film was made and the obvious budget constraints , and the sequence in which we finally get to see what is inside the greenhouse is a definite highlight . The film is most famous thanks to a lead performance from the great Boris Karloff , who might not massively impress in the acting stakes this time ; but still manages an assured horrific performance . The ending is exciting and plays out well , and unlike The Dunwich Horror ; succeeds in explaining the mystery . Overall , while this is only a modest success , it's certainly well worth seeing !
423587	2248099	338095	8.0	A rush of adrenaline	The title of this marvellous French horror thriller translates directly into English as ' High Tension ' , and as anyone who's seen it will tell you ; it's an apt title . Simply put , Switchblade Romance ( to give it English release , and better , title ) is a pure adrenaline rush throughout . The film forsakes substance in favour of masses of tension and the result is a film that is guaranteed to get your heart racing . The fact that the film features numerous sequences of extreme gore doesn't exactly hinder it either . There has been a surge of good , inventive horror coming from overseas and independent studios recently ; the likes of May , Dog Soldiers and Sleepless being among the best of them , and Switchblade Romance sits nicely alongside the cream of the recent crop . This film follows two friends , Alex and Marie who go to stay with Alex's parents in their country home . However , things go awry when a man breaks into the home and brutally murders the family . We then follow Alex and Marie through a roller coaster ride of tension and suspense as they try their best not get sliced and diced ! The film is very stylishly shot , and this has lead many to label it a ' Giallo ' . This is most certainly not true , and there isn't much other than the style of the movie to suggest this . Switchblade Romance is more of a Texas Chainsaw Massacre style horror driven slasher than a Giallo ; the film clearly knows this also , with a direct homage to the seventies classic towards it's climax . The amount of gore on display is impressive , and several scenes are certainly not for the feint-hearted . There's quite an array of weaponry in the film also , from the plain and simple switchblade , to much more exciting weapons like barbed wire , various guns , an axe and , my personal favourite , the chainsaw ! In fact , I am pleased to report that Switchblade Romance features what is maybe the most brutal chainsaw scene ever ! Aside from the weapons and gore , this film is also of note for it's music . The original score sets just the right tone for the goings on - it's atmospheric , but steady and almost like a lullaby , which fits with the film's style nicely . Switchblade Romance also features one of the best uses of original music of recent years , with a great scene that incorporates Muse's " New Born " . Switchblade Romance is pure style , and a complete adrenaline rush . Tension isn't in the film , it IS the film . In spite of it's lack of substance , this movie will have you on the edge of your seat and begging for more . Add that to some lovely music , classy acting and enough gore to fill an abattoir - and what you've got is the makings of a cult classic !
422715	2248099	73747	8.0	Excellent thriller with a few points to make	What we have here is a film that sort of bridges the gap between suburbanite drama and extremely dark science fiction . The story is massively famous by now and has obvious implications about gender roles and each sex's thoughts towards their spouse . However , at its heart , The Stepford Wives is a brilliant mystery thriller that has as much in the way of intrigue as it does in social commentary . The film is based on a book by Ira Levin , who previously wrote feminist horror novel ' Rosemary's Baby ' . The two films are somewhat similar in theme as both focus around what is usually seen as women's work - childbirth in Rosemary's Baby and keeping house in this film . The plot focuses around the town of Stepford and the Eberhart family who are new in town . It would seem that something is up with the place immediately as the women seem completely detached and only interested in house work . The wife , Joanna , soon meets up with fellow new arrival Bobbie Markowe and the two begin to believe that something has happened to the other women , and decide to investigate . The atmosphere is a key element in this film , and director Bryan Forbes capitalises on that by giving Stepford a welcoming atmosphere that always borders on being mysterious and somehow not quite right . The story can be a little slow at times , and as most people will know the twist before going into the film , it can sometimes feel like its taking ages to get where it's going . However , the film keeps the audience interested by constantly hinting at the problem with Stepford and feeding us only small pieces of the puzzle at a time . It has to be said that the plot doesn't completely make sense - there are a few plot holes , and the reason for the men in Stepford wanting a " Stepford wife " doesn't really stand up to scrutiny - but I feel that The Stepford Wives finds making it's point to be more important than minor plot details , and it does that well . It all boils down to a nice conclusion , which wraps up the story well and provides a nice little shock for the audience to digest . Overall , The Stepford Wives isn't quite a masterpiece - but it's certainly a very good film and I definitely recommend it !
423249	2248099	112817	8.0	Effortlessly cool and self-styled western	Dead Man is a unique piece of film . As this is my first taste of Jim Jarmusch , I had no idea of what to expect , but even if I had ; I reckon that this film wouldn't have conformed to them . Dead Man is a surreal and trippy western that peels itself away from the staples of the genre and succeeds in creating something truly one-off and self-styled . Lead by a score written by Neil Young , Dead Man is continually satisfying and powerful ; and you get the impression that every scene has been fully thought through , and is perfectly realised as the auteur intended . For this reason , Dead Man captivates it's viewer from the moment it starts until the moment it ends , and as it descends into full blown trippy weirdness , you can do nothing but stare in admiration of this strange gem of cult cinema . The plot is thin on the ground and it largely lacks meaning , but it doesn't matter because Dead Man is a purely aesthetic experience . Still , it follows William Blake ( Johnny Depp ) , an accountant from Cleveland that arrives in a town to take a job offer , only to find that the vacancy has already been filled ? Dead Man is filmed in very stark black and white , which only adds to the surrealism of the story . Had this film have been done in colour , it would not have captured the same atmosphere that the black and white gives it ; and so this decision was an inspired one indeed . One staple of the western genre that Jarmusch is keen to retain is the use of close-ups . The director spends a lot of time caressing Depp's facial features with his camera and , at times , even focuses on his lead actor when the action doesn't concern him . Aside from keeping in with the western tradition , this also allows Jarmusch to keep the focus on the main character , which keeps the viewer focused on his plight . For this film , Jarmusch has put together a cast of B-movie icons that will have B-movie fans foaming at the mouth . Crispin Glover , Robert Mitchum , Billy Bob Thornton , Lance Henriksen , Gabriel Byrne , John Hurt , Alfred Molina and even Iggy Pop feature and it's great to see so many faces in the same movie . The cast is , of course , lead by a man who is perhaps today's best actor ; Johnny Depp . Depp's name on a credit list speaks for itself , and I don't need to tell you that his performance is great ; nor do I need to point out the effortless cool that this movie exudes , largely thanks to the great man's presence . My only advice is see it . . . see it now .
421661	2248099	65148	8.0	No gore this time , but still a great Lucio Fulci film !	It's hard to believe that this thriller was directed by the same man who would go on to create such gory highlights as Zombie Flesh-Eaters and City of the Living Dead , but indeed this is a film from the Lucio Fulci that us gore hounds know and love . His later Giallo , such as A Lizard in Woman's Skin and Don't Torture a Duckling weren't as bloody as Fulci fans are used to , and this one is even less so ; in fact , it isn't even a horror movie . Fulci does find time for graphic images , however , but things such as a badly decomposed corpse look out of place in a movie that is much more about mystery and suspense than shocking its audience . Fulci often doesn't get the respect he deserves when it comes to movie-making , and that's unfair as he really does know how to tell a story . One on Top of the Other focuses on themes of love and revenge , and follows the story of a doctor with a wife who suffers from chronic asthma . After her death , he is enticed to a nightclub along with his mistress , where he meets a young woman who is the double of his dead wife . Shortly thereafter , the corpse of his wife is unearthed and traces of poison are found in the body . . . The film takes obvious influence from the great Alfred Hitchcock film ' Vertigo ' , but unlike a lot of Italian films from the sixties and seventies ; this one is not merely a retread of its popular American influence . Fulci injects his own style and verve into the plot , and common Giallo elements such as crossed loyalties and compromising situation for the lead victim start to creep in . The acting on display here is superb , with Jean Sorel putting in a fabulous performance in the lead role in which he manages to captivate the audience and be convincing at the same time . The female leads are more striking ; however , and both Marisa Mell and Elsa Martinelli get to act as well providing beautiful eye candy for the audience . Unlike a lot of Giallo's , this one takes place outside of Italy and makes San Francisco the central location . The landscapes look great , and the original jazz music by Riz Ortolani helps to ensure that swinging sixties feel comes across . There is a lack of murders in this film , which may disappoint Giallo and Fulci fans ; but the intrigue that appears instead offsets this nicely , and overall I don't hesitate to say that One on Top of the Other is one of the great Giallo films !
422638	2248099	87884	8.0	Excellent and potent tale of loss	Paris , Texas is my first ever taste of acclaimed director Wim Wenders , and while the film isn't exactly sweet ; it's certainly not bitter enough to steer itself away from the realms of the masterpiece . Paris , Texas is very much a character driven story and it follows the account of a man that wanders out of the hot desert sun with an acute case of amnesia . When his brother , Walt , finds him , he helps him to remember his life , and we then watch as our protagonist rekindles his former relationships first with son , and then with the mother of his child . Wim Wenders handles this story with the utmost skill , and it works thanks to the tentative way that he portrays the characters to the audience . Just like the town of it's title ; Paris , Texas is basically a film about being lost . I ( and I'm sure many other people ) didn't even realise that there was a place called Paris in the middle of Texas , and this little place is symbolic of the substance that is at the core of this movie . The film doesn't benefit from any big name actors , but the actors in the movie do give it their all and ensure that it doesn't fall down on the acting side . Harry Dean Stanton takes the lead role , and does a good job in , at first , portraying a man consumed with amnesia ; and then consumed with the time he has lost . Nastassja Kinski is the only member of the cast that has a really notable list of film credits other than this movie , but ironically she has the least screen time of the five leads . Every minute she is on screen is a delight , however , and she lights up the screen with both of her talents ; looks and acting ability . The young Hunter Carson gives a rare child performance ; i . e . one that isn't incredibly annoying , but strangely he didn't appear in very many movies after this one . The climax to the tale is more than satisfying , and is easily one of the most haunting and potent I've ever seen in a film . Wenders shows his talent with both the execution and the implications of it , and it's a satisfying end to a very satisfying movie . Recommended .
423224	2248099	38975	8.0	A lesson in atmosphere	The Spiral Staircase is one of the most eerie and atmospheric films that I have ever had the pleasure of seeing . The entire movie gives off a sense of malice throughout , and the use of music here is some of the best I've ever seen in a movie . The film's plot follows a series of murders , of which all the victims are people with imperfections . Our hero is Helen ; a young mute girl that works as a nurse for Mrs Warren , an old lady that lives in a big house . Aside from the old lady , also living in the house are her two sons ; Albert and Steven , along with a few other people such as the maid . As the murders are being committed on imperfect women , the old lady becomes concerned for her mute nurse and begs her to leave . When another murder is committed in the house , the danger that the young girl is in becomes more apparent . The first thing you will notice about this hidden gem is it's striking cinematography and lush settings . The film is very Gothic , and that gives it a very foreboding atmosphere . This is without doubt the best things about the film ; in a dark thriller such as this , the atmosphere is always important , and as I said ; this film has plenty . The film also features a lot of intrigue . As it has many characters that could be suspects , it leaves you guessing . Playing it's cards very close to it's chest , we don't find out who is the murderer until the very last minute . The cast of The Spiral Staircase don't excel individually , but they come together very well as an ensemble . Most of them would never make another notable movie , although the majority have rather large filmographies . Robert Siodmak takes the directors chair , and he should be commended for his work . His use of the camera is excellent ; the film features numerous close-ups , and when coupled with the haunting music ; it makes for a great eeriness . There is one sequence in particular where the killer is watching his would-be victim from some bushes in the rain , and that with the haunting music in the background is altogether one of the most frightening sequences ever filmed . Cinematic perfection .
422485	2248099	780622	8.0	Excellent horror - don't miss this one !	I've got to the point where I've seen so many horror films that none of the main horror themes really scare me anymore - but there is just one exception , and this film tackles that idea with a great big toothy grin on its face ! Most legends have had a film about them made at some point ; this is not the first film to take on ' Vagina dentata ' , but the only other one I know of was the little known 2003 Wolfgang Büld film ' Penetration Angst ' - and Teeth does it much better . The plot is preposterous and absurd and while it's clear that the film does have its tongue in its cheek somewhat , I got the impression that the director was trying to make a horror film rather than a comedy . We follow Dawn ; a young girl that is a member of a strange ' purity ' cult which vows not to have sex until marriage . However , she meets a young man through this cult and the pair shares an obvious attraction . After messing him around a bit , she finally gives in to him ; but then changes her mind at the last minute and he rapes her ; but things turn out worse for him than for her when he's left with a bloody stump . . . The Vagina dentata myth is based on a man's fear of sex and in this film , it's blended with the idea of a young girl growing up and losing her virginity . It has to be said that the film doesn't make quite as much of a meal of the ideology as it could have done , although the way it features certain male characters getting ' punished ' for their wrongdoings as well as the central character agonising over what is going on inside her body does at least get the points across . One problem with the film is that it's all very predictable ; there are a few surprises but generally at the start of any one scene , you can pretty much see where it's going to go and this is a bit of a shame considering how bizarre the central idea is . The acting and production values are all decent on the whole and the film stays away from being a goofy ' Troma style ' flick , which is to its credit . However , there is some gore featured and while the central ' monster ' itself is never actually shown , the director does seem to delight in showing the castrated males and this is guaranteed to make the male members of the audience squirm ! Teeth is clearly a film that is not for everyone ; but I'm sure many will be curious just to see what it's like and for what it is , I have to say that Teeth is very well done .
423564	2248099	74102	8.0	A shocking tale of love and obsession	In the Realm of the Senses is a film that has divided opinions among those that have seen it ( a number that is not too big thanks to the film being banned in many countries across the globe ) , but love it or hate it ; you have to admit that In the Realm of the Senses is certainly very interesting . The plot is allegedly ( according to the epilogue ) based on a true story , although I would describe it as a more hardcore version of the 1969 Pinku film ' Blind Beast ' ; although In the Realm of the Senses is a really different experience and could not in any way be considered a copy of the earlier film . The plot primarily focuses on love and obsession , and we get two central characters . They are Kichizo and Sada and the pair meet and fall in love rather quickly . It's not long before they are spending every waking minute together ; and most of the time they spend is naked , engaging in sex all the time . Sada soon becomes infatuated with Kichizo and as their relationship becomes more and more intimate , things begin to spiral out of control . This film is somewhat unique for the fact that it's both Japanese and features gratuitous , full-on nudity . The film really doesn't hold back either , and one of the most shocking things about is how seeing the two central characters naked for most of the film doesn't seem like anything out of the ordinary . There's some hardcore and explicit sex scenes too , with blow jobs , anal etc featuring often . The film is sometimes passed off as merely pornography , but it's not a fair statement to make about the film . While it certainly is very pornographic , it's clear that director Nagisa Oshima valued telling a story over shocking his audience and the gratuitous nudity exists to further the point that the film is trying to make . The film is very well made ; the cinematography is beautiful and all the performers do well ; Eiko Matsuda in particular is excellent as the obsessive leading lady . It's clear that the film is building up to something and while the conclusion is hinted at early on ; it's still shocking enough once it arrives . Overall , this is a fantastic film and a must see for cult fans .
423425	2248099	65466	8.0	Another cult hit from Russ Meyer !	Beyond the Valley of the Dolls is the fourth Russ Meyer film that I've seen , and it's also the odd one out . It's got all the sex , violence and gratuity that you would expect from Russ Meyer - but where are the huge breasts ? Anyway , the film is based on a screenplay by film critic Roger Ebert , and focuses primarily on the drug culture in Hollywood . Ebert gives Hollywood a very colourful character , and the film is absolutely great to look at . The humour and goings on are not exactly subtle either , and like most of Russ Meyer's work - this film is great fun to watch ! The plot focuses on a band called " The Connie Nelsons " and their manager , who travel to Hollywood to make it big . They soon hit the big time , but they also discover the joys of sex and drugs and it doesn't take long for these formerly clean-cut girls to immerse themselves in a hive of sleaze as they all find themselves hooked on " uppers " and " downers " and getting in with some very strange and shady characters . . . When watching this film , it really is best to turn off your brain , forget what you know and just let Meyer take over ! The director imposes his style brilliantly , and succeeds in portraying Hollywood as a corrupt nest of sleaze . The characters are all typically over the top and so are their actions . Meyer packs the film with all manner of sleaze including ravenous lesbians , women posing as men and gratuitous sex scenes . It's surprising that this story came from the mind of Roger Ebert - the same critic who tends to write less than favourable reviews of many of my favourite ' trash ' films . The acting is surprisingly good too , and typically Meyer has cast a beautiful lady in the leading role . Dolly Read is stunningly beautiful and plays the part of the sweet and innocent / slutty whore well ! The plot is entirely wayward and it's never obvious where the film is going , so you can always count on a few surprises - and Meyer certainly doesn't disappoint in that respect ! Overall , this is another great slice of cult cinema from one of the kings , and it comes highly recommended !
423949	2248099	74226	8.0	Oddball seventies horror , and a rare success for Jeff Lieberman	I've learned not to go into Jeff Lieberman's films with high expectations , as although I liked his latest film ; horror-comedy ' Satan's Little Helper ' , both Squirm and Just Before Dawn did nothing for me , despite high expectations before seeing them . However , Blue Sunshine is surely the director's best film , as it works on both a visceral and psychological level . The film is something of a crossover between the zombie horror subgenre , and a drug fuelled mystery plot . The most effective side of the film , horror-wise , is definitely the idea of silly choices you made as a kid coming back to haunt you as an adult . The plot focuses on a batch of drugs called ' Blue Sunshine ' , which was distributed around a certain college ten years ago . Now the drug is coming back to haunt the users by way of hair-loss , headaches , nightmares and an insatiable desire to kill people . We follow Jerry Zipkin , a young man that ends up at the centre of the trouble and decides to get the bottom of the mystery , which centres on a politician trying to get elected by way of a publicity drive . I suppose the main reason why I'm not Jeff Lieberman's biggest fan is because his films often lack bite and don't move swiftly enough . This one is no different on that front , except this time ; instead of merely focusing on a bunch of worms , or yet another troupe of deformed , deranged backwoods killers ; Lieberman has the advantage of an intriguing mystery to base his film on . While it's always obvious where it's going , the director manages to get the audience to care about what's going to happen , and as drugs and their effects are intriguing subjects anyway ; there's always enough to keep things ticking over . Lieberman also injects sequences that see various characters lose their hair before trying to kill anyone and everyone in the vicinity , and these too make the final package more intriguing - the sequence that sees a nanny take out her lust for violence out on a couple of irritating kids being the highlight in that respect . Overall , it has to be said that the film isn't perfect - not everything is perfectly judged , and it could have been streamlined better . Furthermore , it ends prematurely and feels a bit lazy ; but even so , Blue Sunshine is an excellent little flick and comes highly recommended .
421672	2248099	56732	8.0	An excellent surrealist fantasy	I can't say that I'm a big fan of director Luis Buñuel . While I admire his visual flair - his movies often lack backbone , and this brings them down . The Exterminating Angel is the first Buñuel movie that I've really enjoyed . I enjoyed it because I never got the impression that the point of this film was simply to be weird . Buñuel has found a premise - basically , a satire on the behaviour of the upper class - and lampooned it brilliantly . The key to this movie is setting up the central plot , and the director does such a good job of it that after a while ; we don't care that the film is based on an idea that makes no sense at all , and are just able to run with it . The film follows a bunch of guests at a dinner party . At the end of the party , none of them make any effort to go home and after a while it becomes apparent to the party that they physically cannot leave the room . We then watch as the upper class , people who are used to sipping champagne and smoking expensive cigars are reduced to surviving in the most basic ways . They have to hack through the wall to find a water pipe and even begin eating paper to quench their hunger ? The satire works because the acting is just so different to the way that the upper class usually conduct themselves - either on screen or otherwise . The structure of the social classes is clearly defined by Buñuel's film also . This is the sort of thing that would really scare the rich , while other social classes have other things to worry about . Before the nightmare begins , various people are commenting on the conduct of one of their own who has had slightly too much to drink . This wouldn't worry anyone who isn't ' high society ' , but the fact that these people do care about it shows the difference in values between the classes . Buñuel directs the film with almost a complete lack of emotion towards the central ensemble - and this stood out to me as it really allows the film to be funny . It's almost like the director is laughing at the situation that he's put his cast of characters into , which suggests that the Spanish director isn't the biggest fan of the upper classes . There's a million and one ways that this film could be interpreted , and that is what makes it great . If you don't like films that don't make sense ; this probably won't do much for you . However , I think that this is one of those films that need to be experienced ; and I definitely recommend it .
421989	2248099	264508	8.0	Stuart Gordon does HP Lovecraft , with great results again !	From almost the same team that brought us the classic horror Re-Animator sixteen years previously , comes this HP Lovecraft-adapted flick . We've got Stuart Gordon in the director's chair and Brian Yuzna producing , leaving out only cult star Jeffrey Combs . . . who would , actually , have made a great lead ; but never mind . Based on the short stories ' Dagon ' and ' The Shadow Over Innsmouth ' , Dagon has Lovecraft written all over it and follows a fishing village by the name of Imboca . In return for fish and gold , the locals there have taken to worshipping the deity ' Dagon ' . However , this has taken its toll ; as the locals now exist in the form of deformed fish-men ! That's what I love about Lovecraft , he always finds time for deformities and monsters in his stories - which almost always ensures that they're more frightening than most . We follow Paul ; a young man who , along with his friends , become shipwrecked near to Imboca . After venturing to the village in search of a phone and his girlfriend , our hero finds himself trapped and about to be sacrificed to the villager's god ! Dagon is a really good film , and certainly one of the best of this decade ; but despite the talented people behind it , it's still not quite great . The acting is a major letdown , with Ezra Godden doing his best Jeffrey Combs impression ; but personally , I'd rather have seen the man himself . Francisco Rabal died shortly after the release of this film , which is a shame ; but he doesn't have enough screen time to make a lasting impression . The rest of the cast drowns the film where the acting is concerned . It's also rather badly plotted , and gets off to a very slow start ; which is liable to turn some viewers off immediately . Once it gets going , however , it really gets going ; and by then , the acting and plotting don't matter , as it's the special effects and invention that become the stars of the show . The effects look like they should look rubbish , but they really don't . The fish-people actually look good ! The gore is ample , but never gratuitous and the imagination behind the story is immense , and could only have come from the mind of one of the horror genre's great masters . This is no Re-Animator ; but it's a more than decent example of the fact that good horror is still being made !
422426	2248099	140384	8.0	As weird as they come with some ' interesting ' ideas !	The only ' pinku ' film I'd seen before this one was Masaru Konuma's Wife to be Sacrificed , but that didn't prepare me for the oddity of this Japanese ' classic ' ! Quite what the writers and directors were on is anyone's guess , but whatever it was ; it lead to them creating an interesting and unique film that is memorable thanks to it's strange storyline and the way that the ideas are presented without a lot of fuss , which only increases the potency of what the film has to say . The basis of the story is sadomasochism , but director Yasuzo Masumura seems to want to go further as the pleasure-pain idea that S & M is based on is completely overruled by the idea of absolute pleasure through the sense of touch . The film focuses on a blind sculptor who , along with his mother kidnaps a young model after he heard some young kids talking about how exquisite she is . He takes her to his warehouse , which is filled with huge statues and naturally she wants to escape as soon as possible . After a couple of failed attempts , however , she begins to buy into the sculptor's ideas , and soon develops his fixation . This film definitely is shocking , but not because of any large amount of gore or particularly brutal sex scenes . Director Yasuzo Masumura has done an amazing thing in that he's made a film that is shocking thanks to the ideas that it promotes . Naturally , there's a fair amount of nudity ; but it's very soft and clearly wasn't what the director valued most when it came to making this film . There is a rather visceral sequence towards the end which is sure to get the audience cringing , but it's not the most shocking thing about the film - which again is amazing since this would have been the standout in most other movies like this . The atmosphere is surreal throughout , and this is good as it allows the director to throw in just about anything and it comes off as being believable in spite of the fact that a lot of the ideas in the film are really quite ridiculous . I always find it difficult to judge things like acting when a film is subtitled ; but the lead duo are at least believable , while Yasuzo Masumura's cinematography and attention to detail is the finishing touch that makes the film what it is . Overall , Blind Beast is a bizarre oddity that verges on brilliance . Well worth seeing !
423709	2248099	57076	8.0	Second only to Goldfinger !	To be honest , I'm not a massive fan of James Bond films . I do , however , tend to enjoy the ones starring Sean Connery ; and while it doesn't touch the masterpiece ' Goldfinger ' , From Russia With Love is definitely one of Bond's better adventures . It's also one of the few films that has managed to keep a solid reputation after it's release . While many of Bond's adventures are strictly cult flicks , or just not very well liked ; this one is often cited as great film by critics from all corners , and there's a reason for that . This is the Bond film that set the staples of the series , including the theme music and many of the regular characters . The story is typical of the sixties and fires James Bond straight into the thick of the Cold War . We follow the maverick secret agent as he attempts to foil a plot by the evil corporation S . P . E . C . T . R . E . to steal a Lektor ( Russian decoding device ) . As James Bond walks straight into their trap , he must thwart both their agents and the Russians , as the East faces the West a la the Cold War . My main problem with this plot is that it's not on a big enough scale . The only thing at stake is a decoding device which , while still not a bad prize , makes the film feel like a big song and dance for a very small payoff . Still , the plot is handled with great skill and while the film doesn't feature any stunts that rival some of the more recent Bond offerings ; the ones that do feature definitely work and succeed in getting the adrenaline flowing . The film is definitely a lot better as we get past the hour mark . The first hour features rather a lot of talking and not much action ; and while I don't really have a problem with this , most people tune into Bond flicks for smart wit and action sequences . The second hour makes up for the slow first , as we are treated to a climax that takes place on rail , road and water . Sean Connery is , without a doubt , the best man to ever play James Bond . His persona and mannerism fits the character brilliantly and , in my opinion , was never properly replaced . On the whole , this isn't as great as Goldfinger ; but it is a very good film . From Russia With Love is one of the few that will appeal to Bond and Non-Bond fans alike !
422920	2248099	416320	8.0	A change of environment proves lucky for Woody Allen	Every film that Woody Allen releases is automatically a point of interest for me , especially when the film in question has won itself a lot of favourable reviews . Match Point sees Allen in new territory as his beloved New York has been swapped for London , England . Despite this relocation , however , Match Point is still very clearly a Woody Allen film . The film is mostly a romantic drama , but as the story moves forward ; thriller elements start to creep through , and best of all we get a very potent streak of black humour to round things off . The plot typically features the central character in turmoil . We are introduced to former tennis star turned coach , Chris Wilton . He's looking for a meaning to his life and wants to do something different from tennis . After meeting a man named Tom , Chris finds himself the object of Tom's sister Chloe's affections . However , our tennis star has his eyes on Tom's finance ; Nola . After having an affair with Nola , Chris finds himself at decision-making time . Because as we all know ; you can't have two women for long . The film starts off with a sequence in which the protagonist tells us about a tennis ball hitting the top of a net during a game . If it carries on going , your luck is in ; but if it falls back , it isn't . Woody Allen keeps this luck theme going throughout the film , and the way that he harks back to the opening scene towards the end of the film is just great . Being from the UK myself , I was interested to see how Allen would handle the London setting . I've got to say , however , that I'm a bit upset about the fact that he has decided to set the film in the upper crust of society . It's not so difficult for me to relate to upper class New York because I'm not from America ; but as far as I'm concerned , the environment seen in this film doesn't really exist . . . but at least the English characters have English accents . The acting is fine , with Jonathan Rhys Meyers doing well in the lead role and hitting all the right notes as his character changes his stripes later on . Scarlett Johansson is his opposite number and delivers an emotional portrayal as the put-upon mistress , while Emily Mortimer is suitably posh to round off the central threesome . I loved the way the tale climaxes and I'm glad that Allen didn't continue along the lines that many films of this nature are happy to stay between . Overall , I can't say that this is Allen's best effort ; but it's a very good one , and the director has been showing good consistency over the last few years .
421978	2248099	90197	8.0	Weighty film , and as dark as they come	In a Glass Cage isn't an easy film to get on with , as despite the fact that it doesn't contain a lot of blood and gore , the film is horrifying thanks to the power of suggestion and the implications of its characters actions . The film takes in themes of the horrors of war as well the implications of child molestation , and puts these two heinous ideas into one character ; Klaus . Klaus is a former Nazi doctor turned paedophile who has found himself paralysed from the neck down after attempting to commit suicide . He now lives in a house with his wife and daughter , but must reside at all times inside a glass tube , which is referred to as his ' glass cage ' . After breaking into the house , a young man named Angelo blackmails Klaus into taking him on as a nurse , despite the wishes of Klaus ' wife who doesn't warm to the young man . However , it soon transpires that Angelo harbours a wish to become like Klaus , and begins to torture the former Nazi by instigating events to reflect what he used to enjoy , and by reading him passages from a diary detailing the man's obsession . While In a Glass Cage may not be a very enjoyable film , it has to be said that it does give its viewer a lot to think about , and writer-director Agustí Villaronga ensures that his film packs a lot of emotional weight . The way that the director keeps everything bathed in darkness helps to ensure that the look of the film is dark as its subject matter , and this helps to convey the horrific themes on display . The relationship between the doctor and his nurse always makes up the backbone of the movie , and it's also the most interesting aspect as subplots involving the wife and the daughter never reach the same dark highs . The tone of the movie is very serious , and this helped by excellent performances from all concerned . Günter Meisner's performance takes in both evil and regret , as while he doesn't get to do much physical acting ; he plays his part well . The main acting plaudits go to David Sust , however , who continually impresses with his role as the nurse ; also the meatiest role in the film . It has to be said that this isn't a movie for the feint of heart , as scenes involving young boys are not nice to watch and the nihilistic tone of the movie doesn't make it much fun . Still , if you can stomach unpleasantness ; this movie is a treat .
421665	2248099	82479	8.0	If you want gore , you'll find it here !	Anthropophagus is one of the few films on the Video Nasty list that is still banned in Britain in its uncut form to this day ; and that really isn't surprising . While the film only features two heavy scenes of extreme violence , these two alone are good enough reason for the BBFC to get its scissors out and Joe D'Amato's Eurotrash masterpiece features a continually morbid and graphic tone throughout . The film kicks off with a sequence that could have come from any other slasher movie and sees a couple viciously savaged while trying to relax on a picturesque beach . This sequence sets exactly the right tone for the film ; as while it's derivative of a huge number of slasher movies ; it's clear that sleaze director Joe D'Amato is going to take this one further than we're used to going . The plot is splendidly simple , and sees a group of tourists arriving on a remote island after suffering boat problems . They soon realise that the local population has disappeared , and there's something sinister on their tail . . . and this is one psychopath that is never going to listen to reason ! The Greek island setting is superbly realised and the uninhabited settings make for a great location for a film like this to take place . You would expect this movie to suffer from poor production values , but actually that isn't the case . Despite the largely very poor acting ( from esteemed cult figures such as George Eastman and Tisa Farrow ) , the film is well shot and D'Amato utilises a series of macabre elements , which ensures that the film works as a horror movie as well as a grisly shocker . The killer at the centre of the movie really is a great creation and something far different from the norm . While the murderer is a definitely beast , D'Amato gives him a human quality and some attempt is made to show how he became what he is - which overall makes the whole thing much more shocking . This film is notorious for a scene that involves The Beast and a pregnant woman , and it lives up to its reputation of being sick beyond belief . However , you've got to respect D'Amato for this ; as merely having the balls to show it is something that most director's lack . The ending of the movie is superb , and provides a great climax for the title character . Overall , I highly recommend this movie to fans of Euro horror . . . just so long as you've got the guts !
423935	2248099	71675	8.0	Great camp B-movie fun	Larry Cohen has made a name for himself for producing offbeat horror movies , and this story of a killer deformed baby certainly belongs in his filmography . It's Alive is a huge highlight of the horror genre , and one that doesn't get the praise that it deserves . The film is notable amongst other films of similar plotting because of the way that it fully explores it's premise . Rather than focusing on the monster and the murders , Cohen sees fit to show the audience the effect that the birth of a murderous monster has on the family at the centre of the story , the government , the family friends and various other entities ; all of which helps to aid the film in it's bid to be a complete horror thriller . Of course , the film is too silly to be truly touching , but the idea of trying to get the audience to empathise with the characters in this sort of movie is nice , and it adds to kitsch campness of the movie , which does it no end of favours in this kitsch fan's opinion . The acting adheres to the typical , and much loved , B-movie styling and that is another plus point to add to this movie's resume . John P . Ryan in particular is superb as the upset father , and we see him go through a range of emotions in response to the birth of his ' son ' , which is a treat indeed . The script isn't the greatest work of art ever to be brought to the screen , but it's always inventive enough to ensure that the action stays interesting and It's Alive hardly suffers from becoming trite and boring . The creature effects aren't the best ever seen , but Larry Cohen hides this fact by never completely showing the creature . This hampers the movie in a way , as it will no doubt get on many viewers ' nerves as seeing the monster is normally a highlight of this type of movie ; but on the other hand , seeing the monster usually results in disappointment - so at least Cohen's film stays away from that ! On the whole , while this film will do nothing for fans of serious art movies ; horror fans , particularly very B-horror fans , will be in heaven . Highly recommended !
422889	2248099	157503	8.0	Intelligent , witty and biting dark satire	Drop Dead Gorgeous is a film about a teenage beauty pageant . As you might expect ; it features plenty of young girls in skimpy outfits , dancing , singing and all that crap . However , unlike a lot of films of the same ilk ; here , hidden behind a facade of teen beauty and all the other trademarks of the teen comedy genre , is an intelligently written , witty and very dark satire on the consumer society . Drop Dead Gorgeous is a filmed in the style of a documentary , a la ' This is Spinal Tap ' and follows the escapades of a group of contenders in the annual beauty pageant . The contenders are introduced via a very amusing sequence , which sees them tell the audience about themselves . It's very MTV in the way it's done , with all the girls introducing themselves as shallow , fussy , typical teenage girls . After that , the film starts to set its dark tone , with one of the girls being blown up , and is the tone that will be carried throughout the rest of the movie . Some of the humour in this movie is so dark that even I , a fan of very black comedy , couldn't decide whether to laugh at or not ; a woman that gets a beer can melted to her hand , an anorexic previous winner , and the pageant winner being blown up on a huge float are all included in this movie . It's lighter and more tongue in cheek moments are also done very well , such as the part in which one of the judge's brothers gets caught in the car door , or a hilarious ' home video ' of an explosion . The characters in Drop Dead Gorgeous are all , with the exception of Amber Atkins , disagreeable , shallow and overblown stereotypes . This is one of this movie's main assets ; it has the parodying of stereotypical people spot on ; we've got an " I'm not a pervert " pervert judge , an insensitive , egotistical head of the richest family in town , the overenthusiastic boyfriend and many other colourful and amusing characters . Some of the lines said by these characters are priceless ; stupid , but not overly stupid and you really could imagine people like these saying things like the characters in this film do . The entire cast of this movie excels ; it features a lot of small characters and each one plays their part to perfection . The main acting plaudits come for Kirsten Dunst in the starring role of Amber Atkins . Kirsten has the ability to act , and act well and she's also extremely good looking . Many actresses look good and can't act , or vice versa but Kirsten has both abilities , which makes her a very good lady to have in your film . With a few more hits under her belt ; Kirsten may well be remembered as the finest actress of her generation . Two other stand out performances come from Kirstie Alley as the former winner of the pageant and mother of one of the contestants ; and Ellen Barkin , who brings the characters of Amber's mother to life brilliantly . Drop Dead Gorgeous is a film that will be overlooked by many because it's a teen comedy . This is a great injustice ; here we have a film that is extremely funny , well acted and actually has something to say .
421668	2248099	120890	8.0	Seductive , slick and sexy ; great entertainment !	Wild Things is a fantastic example of what can be achieved by not worrying about substance and having a film play for straight entertainment value . Here we have a film that takes elements such as beautiful stars , beautiful locations and a bucket load of plot twists and blends it all into a highly enjoyable film experience . Of course , Wild Things doesn't always come across very realistically and , at times even , it's downright ridiculous ; but it's done in such a way that it doesn't matter , and because of that we have a film that can do what it wants . The film is helmed by John McNaughton , who had his first success with the cult horror flick Henry : Portrait of a Serial Killer . It has to be said that the scene setting and way that the plot moves is somewhat ham-fisted , as sometimes it's painfully obvious that certain sections of the film exist only to give it another selling point ; the argument that starts out between Denise Richards and Neve Campbell beside a swimming pool being a case in point . However , McNaughton makes good of these selling points , and for every three way sex scene and absurd plot twist , the film gains an extra point for trashy entertainment value . It's not immediately obvious what Wild Things is going to be about , as the first twenty minutes serve only in setting the scene and from that base , the film could easily turn into any teenage school flick . However , it turns out that this time is well used ; as by nulling the audience into a false sense of security , the film is able to make sure that every twist comes as a surprise . The film benefits from a great big name cast , which is anchored by Matt Dillon ; who gives one of his best performances . Dillon clearly enjoys himself , and his persona is able to suit both the sleazy and upstanding nature of his character . Kevin Bacon sleepwalks and isn't really able to show his true talent , and similarly Neve Campbell looks out of place ( sexy with it ) in her role as a teenage junkie . However , Denise Richards rounds the piece of nicely with a charged performance and the ensemble is nicely topped off by the likes of Bill Murray , Theresa Russell and Robert Wagner . The settings that the movie takes place in look great , and ensure that there's more eye candy than just the female leads . Director McNaughton presents a fabulously mysterious atmosphere which obviously bodes well with the plot and , on the whole , if you want a couple of hours of entertainment ; you can do a lot , lot worse than this twisty little flick .
422475	2248099	361862	8.0	Dark and gritty - a great film !	In the middle of the mass of blockbusters , dumbed down horror movies and samey Indie dramas ; it's nice to see that some filmmakers still feel the need to push the bar and deliver something different . The Machinist is a deeply dark and disturbing movie that sees Christian Bale as a worker in an industrial factory . If he were any skinnier , he wouldn't exist and he hasn't slept in a year ; but still he manages to carry on his mundane existence . Things aren't quite rosy in his life either ; strange things are happening to him without explanation and it isn't long before our protagonist doubts his own sanity . Christian Bale lost an amazing 63 pounds for this movie , and while it might have been a struggle for the actor ; it certainly wasn't in vain ! Bale's stick-like , ill appearance adds immensely to the film and if director Brad Anderson hadn't got himself such a dedicated performer in Christian Bale , The Machinist wouldn't have been half the film it is . Bale has impressed on numerous occasions , and it's about time he got praise he deserves . Christian Bale's main co-star is most definitely the atmosphere . Brad Anderson is keen to get down and dirty with this movie , and he's given it a truly downbeat , gritty style . This is absolutely great to look at , especially for fans of macabre movies . The claustrophobic camera angles add to this atmosphere and help to enforce the idea that the machinist is living in his own surreal environment . The plot works more from a premise than an actual story ; but this is good as it allows the director to put the focus of the story squarely on the protagonist , and his decent into insanity provides an ample base for an intriguing movie . The Machinist is a very encouraging film , as it shows that there is still room for dark , macabre films in modern cinema . Brad Anderson's earlier feature ' Session 9 ' shows that the man has a real flair for atmosphere , and it will be interesting to see how his remake of George Romero's less than brilliant ' The Crazies ' turns out . On the whole , this film is excellent . The atmosphere is beautifully done , the acting is superb and the film manages to keep your interest throughout . What more could you ask for ?
423309	2248099	83658	9.0	Beautiful , atmospheric , thought-provoking .	Based on a novel by Philip K . Dick , this futuristic urban Sci-Fi film is a masterpiece indeed . Director Ridley Scott has managed to turn Dick's story into a dark and complex film-noir styled mystery , that packs as much punch on an aesthetic level as it does on an emotional and substantial one . It's clear throughout the film that the movie makers ' intentions was to make this more of an intelligent character study cum thought-provoking drama rather than the thrill seeking movie that the Sci-Fi genre movies usually are . This is shown by the way that the action in the movie is kept down to a bare minimum , and the way that the film always seems to want to put forward an idea rather than an action sequence . The plot , which covers themes such as what it takes to be considered alive , follows a group of four androids ( " Replicants " ) that have escaped their masters and come to Earth , where Replicants are illegal . Their intention is to seek out ' the maker ' and try to add to their maximum four-year lifespan , given to them to ensure that they wont have sufficient time to develop emotions . On their tail is Deckard ; a policeman in the business of hunting Replicants ; known as a Blade Runner . Through a grim setting and dark characterization ; Ridley Scott has truly succeeded in giving Blade Runner a classic film-noir style . This bodes well with the futuristic metropolitan version of Los Angeles that the film takes place in . Both of these elements blend excellently with the characters , which are intriguing as they are dark . Harrison Ford steps into the role of Deckard ; the classic noir protagonist . We never really delve into his character ; but at the same time , that ensures that the mystery surrounding him is kept up , which serves in making our protagonist all the more intriguing . Rutger Hauer , who gives a career-best performance as the leader of the Replicants , matches him . Hauer treads the line between pathos and pure evil brilliantly , and it's always easy to believe that he is the doomed android that the movie presents him as . The main thing I love about this movie is it's style ; the dark Gothic undertones are superb to look at , and once the film enters it's final third , the atmosphere takes over and the way that it builds to it's beautiful and classic conclusion is absolutely superb . Blade Runner may have been met with negativity on it's release ; but today it's an absolute classic .
421756	2248099	206314	9.0	Killer mix of Dual and The Hitcher !	Well , I didn't have very high hopes for this one given how many thrillers these days aren't up to much - but to my absolute surprise , Roadkill is full to the brim with tension and manages to succeed admirably in spite of the fact that it borrows heavily from classic films such as Duel and The Hitcher . Yes , it would seem that originality wasn't high on director john Dahl's priority list when it came to making this film , although he does appear keen to buck as many clichés as possible , and the nail-biting tension that features often more than makes up for the lack of originality anyway . The plot focuses on Lewis ; a young man travelling across the desert to meet up with his friend Venna . However , on the way to see her he ends up getting saddled with his prankster brother Fuller , and it's not long before the brother has bought a CB radio and is starting to wind up the local truck drivers . They come across a man calling himself ' Rusty Nail ' on the CB , and after playing a prank on him , the pair find that the truck driver doesn't have a very keen sense of humour . . . There are some really great sequences in this film - from the many chase scenes , all the way down to the hectic and exciting climax - Roadkill is an entertaining thrill ride throughout . The plotting is surprisingly engrossing , as the film focuses on the two central characters for most of the running time , before shifting gears half way through and adding an extra character into the mix . The acting is superb considering the cast members . I saw Paul Walker for the first time in the lamentable thriller The Fast and the Furious - and he really shouldn't have made it , as the kid has talent and that is shown in this film , as well as in the surprise 2006 hit ' Running Scared ' . Walker has great chemistry with the brash Steve Zahn , and the victim side of the cast is rounded off by Leelee Sobieski , who in fairness ; doesn't have a lot of time to impress . The real standout , however , is Ted Levine , whose uncredited voice is that of the central villain . Overall , along with director John Dahl's previous films The Last Seduction and Rounders - Roadkill is a film that hasn't got the respect it deserves . Highly recommended !
423806	2248099	60701	9.0	Absolutely stunning cult Euro sleaze flick !	It has to be said that The Diabolical Dr Z is a lot like Jess Franco's most famous film , The Awful Dr Orlof ( in fact , said doctor even gets a mention here ) ; but if you ask me , the superior film is this one . This time , rather than deal with facial reconstruction as Orlof did ; sleaze master Franco deals with mind control . The plot , unlike many of Franco's films , is straight forward and here Franco proves that he can actually be quite a good story teller , when he doesn't get bogged down by too many sub plots and things that don't make sense . The film takes obvious influence from George Franju's masterpiece , Eyes without a Face ( as many Euro horror films at the time this was made did ) , but Franco injects a lot more of his own stuff here than he did with Orlof . The doctor of the title doesn't appear for long , but before his death ; he does provide the film with its main plot point - that being a mind control machine . When he suffers a heart attack , his daughter takes it upon herself to gain revenge - and so she takes control of the mind of a beautiful dancer calling herself ' Miss Death ' , who dispatches the doctors who caused Dr Z to suffer a heart attack by way of her long , poisoned , finger nails ! The main talking point where this film is concerned is , of course , the style ! Franco has shot the film in beautiful black and white , which , along with the excellent use of shadows , locations and cast members ensure that the film has both a dark , gloomy atmosphere and a real sense of beauty . Jess Franco's name has become synonymous with trashy Eurocult rubbish - but if you'd only ever seen this film from him , I wager that you wouldn't know why ! The Diabolical Dr Z is art , pure and simple . The locations shot are one thing - but by far my favourite aesthetic element of the film is amazingly beautiful Miss Death , played by Estella Blain . The exotic dancer enters the film in a great sequence that sees her performing her nightclub act , in which she travels across a spider's web to seduce and kill her victims . From then on , she lights up every scene she's in - especially the ones that see her wearing the suit from her act ! The film isn't very gory , but the horror appears from the ideas behind the plot , and scenes such as the one that see Dr Z's daughter hideously burned are definitely very gruesome . I've got to say that I'm surprised at how great this film is - and I'll finish off this review by giving The Diabolical Dr Z the highest of recommendations !
421676	2248099	100814	9.0	Giant underground worms , a barrel of laughs and some very nifty special effects - monster movie masterclass !	Tremors was one of my all time favourite movies as a kid , but since then ; only my nostalgia for the film has remained . Upon seeing the film for the first time as an adult , it immediately hit me that I had great taste even as a child . Despite being an overblown and silly monster movie at heart - Tremors is a damn good film . The thing about Tremors that stands out the most is definitely the special effects . While none of them are particularly impressive individually - together , they combine to brilliantly create the illusion that the small town of ' Perfection ' really is under attack from giant subterranean worms ! Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward take the lead roles as a couple of handymen , living out of a truck , that decide they want to move up in the world . A local , and larger , town is their desired destination ; but before they can exit Perfection , they uncover a lot of strange events . Severed heads in a pool of blood , a dehydrated man atop a telephone tower and , best of all , a car that's been dragged underground - radio still playing ! Along with a college student called Rhonda , it doesn't take our heroes long to realise that their quiet Nevada town is infested with giant underground worms ! The main reason why Tremors works so well is because it follows the same plot formula as the classic monster movies such as ' Them ! ' . This makes the film predictable ; but when the plotting is this much fun , it really doesn't matter . Adding massively to the entertainment value are the two leading men . Their conversations are constantly funny , and ensure that the film is never boring for a second . Typically for this sort of film ; almost all of the residents of Perfection like to spend their spare time doing things that make vibrations - bouncing basket balls , driving tractors , playing with pogo sticks etc ; but even this unlikely situation can be forgiven due to the extreme good nature of the movie . The characters on display are really great , the best of them being Burt Gummer , played by Michael Gross . Complete with his basement full of guns and wife who's just as nuts as him ; Gross steals every scene he's in . Something that's often ignored in films like this is the writing . Writers S . S . Wilson and Brent Maddock have put together an excellent story , complete with all the suspense , inventiveness and laughs that you could ever want . On the whole , Tremors is a cut above the average monster flick !
423056	2248099	56869	9.0	Seaside gulls go mental in Hitchcock's macabre masterpiece !	Despite spending most of his career within the realms of the thriller genre , Alfred Hitchcock hasn't restricted himself where variation is concerned . Most of his best work represents a different type of thriller , and The Birds is no different . It is often said that Psycho is Hitchcock's first foray into the horror side of the thriller , and it is indeed ; but it's not the complete horror film that The Birds is . Often cited as an obvious influence for Night of the Living Dead , The Birds follows Melanie Daniels as she travels to the seaside town of Bodega Bay with a pair of lovebirds for Mitch Brenner , an eligible bachelor that she met in a pet shop in San Francisco . However , while there the birds of the coastal town begin to attack the residents and so begins a terrifying tale of man's feathered friends waging a war against humanity . . . It could be said that the plot of The Birds is ridiculous , and it is . The idea of birds , a type of animal that isn't aggressive , attacking humans despite living with us for millions of years is preposterous and is never likely to happen . However ; it is here where the film's horror potency lies . Birds live with us in harmony ; we're so used to them that for the most part we don't even realise that they're there , and the idea of something that we don't notice suddenly becoming malicious is truly terrifying . Especially when that something is unstoppable , as the birds are portrayed as being in this film . The fact that the birds ' motive is never really explained only serves in making it more terrifying , as it would appear that somewhere along the line they've just decided to attack . Of course , the film could be interpreted as having Melanie's arrival , or the presence of the lovebirds as the cause for it all ; but we don't really know . This bounds the film in reality as if there was a reason given , it might be improbable ; but there's no true reason given ( although there are several theories ) , so it can't be improbable ! The first forty minutes of the film feature hardly any - if any - horror at all . Hitchcock spends this part of the movie developing the characters and installing their situation in the viewers ' minds , so that when the horror does finally come along , it has a definite potency that it would not have had otherwise . In fact , at first the birds themselves come across as a co-star in their own movie as there are brief references towards them , but they never get their full dues . However , once the horror does start , it comes thick and fast . Hitchcock , the master craftsman as always , uses his famous montage effects and never really shows you anything ; but because you're being bombarded with so many different shots , you'd never realise it . Many people have tried to copy this technique , but most have failed . Hitchcock , however , has it down to an art and this is maybe the film that shows off that talent the best . There are numerous moments of suspense as well , many of which are truly nail biting . We see the birds amassing and ready to strike - but they don't . And this is much more frightening than showing an attack from the off . Hitchcock knows this . The final thirty minutes of The Birds is perhaps the most thrilling of his entire oeuvre . First , Hitchcock gives us an intriguing situation where numerous inhabitants of the town give their views on the events , and also explains the birds ' situation with humans , even giving the audience an angle of expertise from an ornithologist's point of view . He then follows it up with a truly breathtaking sequence of horror that hasn't been matched since for relentless shock value . Hitchcock has made many great films , and this certainly stands up as one of them . Here , Hitchcock gives a lesson in film directing and creates a truly macabre piece of work in the process . I dread to think what the state of cinema would have been if Hitchcock had never picked up a camera , but luckily for us ; he most certainly did .
422229	2248099	70111	9.0	Italy's version of the classic romantic comedies from the thirties !	Italy didn't exactly hold back when it came to ripping off films back in the seventies - everything from Dirty Harry to Jaws got the Italian treatment , but I must say I never expected to see an Italian sex comedy version of the classic romantic comedies of thirties USA ! Even more surprising than the premise of this film is the fact that it's good ! Sergio Martino , a director who tried his hand at a number of different genres , but will always be best remembered for his superb Giallo efforts such as The Strange Vice of Mrs Wardh and The Case of the Scorpion's Tail , has put together a delightful comedy that works thanks to the fact that the action never lets up , and it's really quite funny ! The plot focuses on Commendatore La Noce , a man who has polluted a river . He realises that he has to bribe an honourable to get away with it - but the problem is that the honourable in question IS completely honourable . However , he does have one vice - he likes to sleep with other people's wives . Not wanting use his own frigid other half , the Commendatore lets his assistant find him a prostitute to act as his wife . It was actually quite odd watching this film as after watching a number of Italian sex movies , I've come to expect a lot of sleaze . This one features brief nudity and some swearing , but it's extremely tame overall . Martino has made the film more ' cheeky ' than anything else , as the lead characters are sexually promiscuous , but sex itself isn't actually seen . This is no bad thing , however , as loads of sex would have distracted from the comedy . Of course , my main reason for seeing this film was because it stars the beautiful Edwige Fenech - and although I say this almost every time I see one of her films , she really has never looked better than she does here ! Martino and Fenech worked together on a number of occasions throughout their careers , and it shows as the director really knows how to make best use of his stunning lead actress ! The plot is quite incidental to the set pieces , but it's not important as the film is never boring . The scenes aboard the train midway through are the best , but the film introduces new things to chew every time it seems to be drying up , and this ensures that Giovannona Long-Thigh is absolutely great fun to watch !
422319	2248099	52811	9.0	Macabre story of coffins and corpses . . . this is great stuff !	The Flesh and the Fiends is similar , in a lot of ways , to the Val Lewton produced Robert Wise film , The Body Snatcher , but for some reason ; this one has flown further under the radar . It's odd , because despite the greatness of the other film ; The Flesh and the Fiends is a lot better , and has the added malevolence of being based on a true-life story . The film takes place in Edinburgh , and director John Gilling does an excellent job of ensuring that the city looks as foreboding as possible , and the perfect home for a story as macabre as this one . The film follows the idea of having to break eggs to make an omelette , and sees Doctor Robert Knox buying corpses from a couple of murderous grave robbers in order for him to have subjects , from which new surgical procedures can be ascertained . The real stars of the show , however , are the graverobbers themselves ; Burke and Hare . They begin their careers by simply taking bodies from graves ; but once they realise how lucrative the business of selling cadavers is , they soon resort to making a few corpses of their own . . . The biggest name in the cast is the one belonging to the great Peter Cushing . Cushing has shown throughout his career that he is capable of a number of different roles , and his role here is one of the best he's had . He gets to sink his teeth into the character of Doctor Knox . In fact , this man isn't a world away from Cushing's world-beating turn as Doctor Frankenstein in Hammer's classic series , which explains why Cushing is so good at it . George Rose and Donald Pleasance give the film its extra dimension in the roles of the graverobbers . Rose is good , but it's Pleasance who really stands out in this film . Seeing him in a role like this is actually quite heartbreaking ; as here we see how great he can be , rendering his roles in films like Halloween even more of a waste of time . The plot plays out from a number of different angles , ensuring that there's always enough going on around the central plot to ensure that the film never dries up and becomes boring . It's strange that a film of this quality could fly straight under the radar ; but somehow it has . However , copies of this are out there ; and it definitely is well worth tracking down !
422169	2248099	78344	9.0	Emanuelle meets nunsploitation !	There is a lot of variety in the Emanuelle series , and as such ; a lot of strange and rather silly ideas ; but having Laura Gemser dressed up as a nun and living in a convent is surely one of the silliest ! I'd even go as far as to say that this plot could be considered blasphemous ! Clearly , this film is just an attempt by director Giuseppe Vari to cash in on both the Emanuelle series and the nunsploitation wave in one fell swoop , and as is the case with a lot of the Emanuelle flicks ; the only thing that really ties this film to the rest of the series is the lovely leading lady , Laura Gemser . Apparently , Emanuelle has decided to renounce her shady past and has taken up residency inside a convent . She is given the task of looking after the young and beautiful Monica ; a girl who was dropped off at the convent by her wealthy father . However , it's not long before the young girl's outlook on life begins to rub off on the previously promiscuous " nun " and Emanuelle begins to question whether or not being a woman of God is actually a suitable career path . . . In the context of the rest of the series , and considering that there is no explanation for Emanuelle's sudden change of attitude , it has to be said that the plot line featured in this film is absurdly ridiculous . However , the film clearly isn't meant to be looked at that way and as a stand alone nunsploitation flick ; Sister Emanuelle is excellent , and by far my favourite of the ten or so Emanuelle flicks that I've seen . The film does represent a real change of pace for the series as for most of the film ; Emanuelle is retracted to a nun's habit and doesn't feature in as many sex scenes as we're used to . That isn't a big problem , however , as this time Laura Gemser is joined by the beautiful Swiss actress Mónica Zanchi , who pretty much takes up the lead role . Unlike most Emanuelle films also , this one actually has a couple of themes going on ; namely , the corruption of innocence , and judging by the ambiguous ending , there also seems to be something in there about how a person like Emanuelle is not going to be able to abandon what it is she stands for . Overall , this is a very good little film and comes highly recommended to both Emanuelle fans and exploitation fans in general !
423316	2248099	100581	9.0	Another excellent exhibition of horror from Italy !	You can always count on an inventive and intriguing movie when it comes to anything that Argento has touched , and this Argento-scripted film is just that ! The great director has left the directorial duties up to his protégé ; Michele Soavi for this movie , and that is somewhat ironic because The Sect easily tops anything that Argento himself directed in the 1990's . Michele Soavi looked pretty promising up until 1994 when he released the astonishing ' Dellamorte Dellamore ' , and then promptly disappeared off the horror radar . It's a massive shame that the man , up until now , hasn't followed up on his four horror films ; as I , and many other horror fans ( I'm sure ) , would agree that if he'd added a few more films to his oeuvre ; he could be right up there with the master himself . The plot for this film follows a young woman who almost knocks a man down while driving in her car . She then takes the man home , but due to the events that transpire ; it quickly becomes obvious that she didn't take him home purely by chance . . . As soon as the movie opens , with America's " Horse With No Name " , and then a character quoting lyrics from The Rolling Stones ' " Sympathy for the Devil " , you just know that you're going to be in for a great ride ; and the rest of the film doesn't disappoint ! Soavi succeeds in creating a fabulously foreboding atmosphere throughout the movie , and his direction isn't bad either . The locations are great ; the underwater labyrinth underneath the house at the centre of the movie , which echoes Inferno , being the very best in that department ! Soavi excels at direction , and this only reinforces my point about the massive shame it is that he hasn't followed up on Dellamorte Dellamore . His camera angles are superb and he really knows how to build tension and suspense ! Herbert Lom is the pick of the cast , and the classic horror actor delivers an excellent hammy performance and every moment he's on screen is a delight . The film definitely does have problems , however ; the fact that it's about twenty minutes overlong is one of them , and the rather silly ending is another - but on the whole , this is an excellent exhibition of horror and comes with a high recommendation from yours truly !
421801	2248099	171804	9.0	Compelling and thought-provoking drama - a must see !	I've had ample opportunities to see Boys Don't Cry over my film viewing career , but have always neglected to do so because of the themes of it's story . Simply put , the idea behind this film doesn't interest me much and that is the reason for me not bothering to finally see the film . However , now that I have seen it , I don't know why I waited so long ; Boys Don't Cry is an excellent film . As rich in themes and life lessons as it is compelling , the film works on a number of levels and is topped off by a truly excellent cast of young performers that give it their all and help to ensure that Boys Don't Cry is the success that it so richly deserves to be . The film follows the intriguing , and oddly true , story of Brandon Teena , or rather Teena Brandon ; a girl who is in the midst of a gender identity crisis and decides to live her life as a boy . After finding a young man and woman in a bar , Brandon quickly finds herself on her way to a small town in Nebraska , where she quickly becomes friends with the locals . . . all the while harbouring her secret . When it comes to good films that are directed by women , there isn't many to list ; but Boys Don't Cry is certainly one that belongs towards the top of that short list . Kimberly Peirce excellently directs the film , and after viewing her past filmography it is evident that Peirce was very dedicated to this story as she produced a short film version of it in 1995 . While Peirce's direction stands out , it is certainly not the star of the show , as that accolade falls to the scintillatingly brilliant Hilary Swank . Swank picked up an Oscar for her performance in this movie , and that momentous event represents one of the few times that the Academy has given the award to the right person . The central role of this movie is the sort of role that every performer wants to get as it allows them to really get their teeth into it , and that is certainly what Swank does . The rest of the cast also does well in their roles , with Chloë Sevigny and Peter Sarsgaard being the standouts among them . Every scene in the movie is rich with substance and double meaning , and as we spend the whole movie getting acquainted with the various parties ; what happens at it's conclusion is both shocking and heart-breakingly tragic . The way that the film pulls off it's climax is skilfully handled , and it's also detached enough for the audience to make their own mind up about , which beats the sickening thickly laid substance approach that so many films latch onto . The substance emancipates from the girl wanting to be the other sex , but if you look deeper into the film , it is not just this element that lends it substance . The meaning of Boys Don't Cry can be stretched to any and all moments in life when you're not the person you want to be , and the story while tragic and shocking , is ultimately uplifting , which only adds more confusion to the already potent cocktail of emotions that Boys Don't Cry forces you into . If , like I was , you aren't watching this film because it's subject doesn't appeal to you ; you should book your ideas up . There is something for everyone in this compelling drama .
423815	2248099	67134	9.0	A Giallo to see once you've seen the classics of the genre	The Giallo sub-genre has produced some really great films ; films such The House With the Laughing Windows , What Have They Done To Solange , and just about everything Dario Argento made ; and with that in mind , The Fifth Cord isn't that good a film . However , as lesser-known Giallo's go ; The Fifth Cord will no doubt prove interesting viewing for Giallo fans . It's not great , but the film never really sets out to be ; it's a Giallo typical of the film style , and features many of the Giallo trademarks , which will no doubt please fans . The Fifth Cord also benefits from having Django star Franco Nero in the lead role ; which lends it a touch of class , and an extra quota of cult value . The plot is typical Giallo , and merely follows a murder investigation . It's the central character , therefore , that is most interesting about this film . Franco Nero stars as an alcoholic journalist , put on the trail of the murder both due to his profession , and the fact that the police see him as a suspect in the investigation . Ennio Morricone is most famous for his scores to Sergio Leone's masterpieces , but he's also done a lot of work for Giallo's . His score here doesn't rival the ones in the Spaghetti Westerns ; but , as ever , Morricone does a good job of setting the right atmosphere for the film , as his score goes from the swinging relaxed mood associated with Italian films , to a more piercing score for the macabre scenes . Nero's performance is a little ropey , and at times he's very hammy ; but his screen presence makes up for it , and I really couldn't imagine this film without him in it . The film is well directed by Luigi Bazzoni , who shoots in a number of locations ; with many of the scenes ( the build up to the ending especially ) being memorable due to his location shots . The murders aren't the most imaginative I've ever seen , but most are suitably macabre ; and more than do their job in creating a foreboding atmosphere . One of the problems with Giallo is that they're often hard to follow , and this film suffers from that ; but the plot is largely well paced , and the ending provides something of a surprise . This film is too insubstantial on the whole to be a ' must see ' ; but I still won't hesitate to recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Italian horror .
422186	2248099	324133	9.0	Anything but dull	Swimming Pool is a first rate film from French genius François Ozon . This thriller makes best use of everything that makes cinema great , and it is therefore a delight to view . Swimming Pool follows Sarah Morton , a British author that travels to her publisher's dream home in France in order to have a rest while she works on her new book . However , her tranquillity is soon disturbed when her publisher's daughter ; a sex-crazed , good time girl , turns up out of the blue and turns Morton's rest into something quite different . One criticism that could be , and has been , made of this film is that not a lot a lot happens . That , however , depends on your viewpoint ; the action is stretched , but the relaxed tone of the film blends magnificently with the beautiful French scenery , and Ozon's attention to detail with the characters ensures that , although slow , Swimming Pool never descends into boredom and there's always something on offer for it's audience to enjoy . I , personally , was completely entranced from start to finish . The casting of Charlotte Rampling as the uptight British novelist really was an inspired move . She's absolutely brilliant in the role , and you can't imagine anyone else playing that character to such a degree . Speaking of great casting choices , Ludivine Sagnier is similarly brilliant as Rampling's sexy co-star . She brings just the right amount of insecurity and lustfulness to her role , and it's not hard to see why Ozon continues to cast her in his movies . The film is very melodramatic , but never overacted ; and this is a testament to the quality of acting on display . Swimming Pool benefits implicitly from a haunting soundtrack , which perfectly accents the happenings on screen , and certain points in the movie where the soundtrack is used are truly electrifying . François Ozon is truly one of cinema's greatest assets at the moment . This is only my second taste of his work ( the hilariously fabulous ' Sitcom ' being the other ) , and if his backlog and future releases match the quality of the two films I've seen from him so far ; he may well become one of cinema's all time greats .
423477	2248099	74954	9.0	Fantastic seventies flick !	Nashville Girl falls somewhere between an exploitation flick and a drama , but I'm not surprised that this is often considered an exploitation classic ; as there are more than enough exploitative elements and the drama itself is interesting also . The film takes place in the Deep South and primarily focuses on the country music industry , although lots of other things come into play too . The main reason this film is so good is because of the way the narrative works ; so many things happen in this film and it really doesn't become boring even for a minute , which is definitely much to its credit . The main character is Jamie Barker ; a young country girl living in a no good town . She's out skinny dipping one day and attracts some unwanted attention from a no good hick type who proceeds to go ahead and rape her . The young girl is upset and confused and after an argument with her parents , decides to go to Nashville in order to find fame and fortune . So she sets off hitch hiking and gets a lift with two truckers before eventually reaching Nashville and finding that the way to the top is not always paved with gold . Monica Gayle takes the lead role and does excellently with it . She really convinces as the naive young girl at the film's centre and her likable persona is a real credit to the film . There's really nothing wrong with her performance and I'm surprised the actress didn't go on to make more films . Gus Trikonis ( who would go on to direct the low budget horror The Evil a couple of years later ) directs this film well ; creating just enough of a sleazy atmosphere to please exploitation fans . The way that Nashville is portrayed is gritty and sleazy and while there's not much actual sleaze in the film , the atmosphere is a benefit to it . I can't say I'm a fan of this sort of music ; but the songs featured are catchy enough and well sang . I don't know if Monica Gayle did her own singing ; I'd like to think so , but she probably didn't . Anyway , this film is engrossing for its entire ninety minute runtime and it all boils down to a satisfying conclusion . Overall , Nashville Girl is an excellent little film that could do to be better known . Fans of seventies thrillers will want to check this little flick out !
421934	2248099	78916	9.0	Better than your average sleaze film !	Beyond the Darkness is a top quality slice of sleaze from the master Joe D'Amato . Everything about this movie is morbid ; from the brutal killings , to the twisted central relationships , all the way down to the macabre fate of the central character's girlfriend . The film starts off rather slowly , and keeps this relaxed pace going throughout , which makes the brutal gore scenes all the more shocking . D'Amato approaches every scene in the same light , and scenes that see young women hacked up with a butcher's knife , or unceremoniously gutted feel like the norm . The film takes place mostly inside a picturesque mansion ; another contradiction to the events that the film features . We follow young Frank as he loses his girlfriend . Distraught , he digs up the dead body and proceeds to gut her and place on a bed inside his home . From here , we follow the young man as he brings home several young women , many of which meet brutal ends . Perhaps the most unnerving thing about all of this is the fact that Frank is not the film's main villain ; as that honour falls to his housemaid Iris ! I can't profess to have seen more than a handful of D'Amato films , but this one stands out from what I have seen . Beyond the Darkness feels much more professional than the likes of D'Amato's Emanuelle entries , and it's clear that the film wasn't made just for a quick buck . The gore scenes are surprisingly realistic , and despite a gnarled skull popping up from a bath of acid ; it's clear the film isn't meant to be taken lightly . Beyond the Darkness is often listed among the goriest films ever made , and the reason for that isn't because there's lots of splatter - the gore in this film really hits home ! And it's not just the blood and guts that make this film sleazy , smaller things such as the fact that Frank is breastfed by his housekeeper help to ensure that there is more than enough sleaze here . The over the top soundtrack from Dario Argento's house band , Goblin , makes sure that a tension filled ambiance benefits the film , while surprisingly good acting performances and a script that is a little better than what you'd expect from seventies Italian gore films ensures that Beyond the Darkness is a must see for the cult horror fan . This sleaze comes highly recommended !
422362	2248099	109579	9.0	Brilliant dark character study	When it comes to dark and morbid thrillers , there's no one around that can handle them like Roman Polanski does . It is with that in mind , therefore , that I say Polanski is the best man for the job of adapting Ariel Dorfman's stage play ; ' Death and the Maiden ' . He proves this with the resulting movie , which is a thrill ride , combined with a character study all wrapped up in a layer of morbidity ; needless to say , the film really hits home . Polanski handles this story , and his actors with the utmost precision and I have no qualms with labelling this movie as one of the man's masterpieces . I have no idea quite why it hasn't been better received , as although it's not up there with the likes of Knife in the Water , Chinatown and Rosemary's Baby ; this is Polanski doing what Polanski does best , and when he's at his best ; the man is brilliant . The story follows a chance encounter between a political lawyer and his neighbour , whom the man's wife is certain , is the same man who brutally beat and raped her while blindfolded under the reign of a fascist regime . What follows is a three-way character study between the victim , the man she thinks is her oppressor , and her husband ; who is caught in the middle . The themes of truth and justice are rampant in this tale and as we watch to see if the villain of the piece really is the man who oversaw torture in the oppression , we are always reminded of the idea of the difference between a right and just punishment , and otherwise . As this is based on a stage play , it is the actors that are very much the star of the show . The three-pronged cast makes for a great ensemble , and every single one of them impresses . Sigourney Weaver gives determination and anger to her victim , and it is easy to believe that this woman really was tortured and beaten . Stuart Wilson is great also as the man caught in the middle of a horrible situation , but it is Ben Kingsley that provides the real standout performance . He manages to skilfully tread a line between an evil madman and a pathetic innocent victim brilliantly , and he ensures that at all times we are asking the question " did he ? " . Polanski's direction is superb , and the thing that most impressed me is the way that he firmly positions the tale in the middle of nowhere . This ensures no distraction , and makes sure that we are put firmly within our character's plight . On the whole , this is one of the best films that Polanski ever made . Considering his prowess as a filmmaker ; that is really saying something and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this film to anyone who enjoys movies .
422800	2248099	53125	10.0	Entertaining thrill-ride from start to finish	Alfred Hitchcock made a lot of films , many of which are very good ; and a select group of which are out and out masterpieces . His 1959 spy thriller , North by Northwest is undoubtedly among the man's best work ; yet it stands out as something of a black sheep among the great director's other works . While the likes of Vertigo and Rear Window pull the viewer into the story by way of an intriguing and mysterious plot line ; North by Northwest goes completely the other way , and draws you in with simple , old-fashioned entertainment value . It's true that there isn't much substance here , but at the same time ; you can't doubt North by Northwest's credibility for a second , as Hitchcock has laid on the style and his story telling is as sharp as ever . The plot is typically Hitchcockian and sees a man kidnapped by a group of gangsters ; on the mistake the he is someone else . After narrowly escaping , our hero goes on the run ; from both the gangsters and the law . As he is drawn deeper and deeper into unfolding events , he finds himself more and more unable to stop them unfolding . By today's standards , North by Northwest could be seen as clichéd . Hitchcock has thrown in all the common spy thriller elements ; from femme fatales and a British villain , to car chases and even an overblown finale ; but Hitchcock implements all these elements in such a way that the film never feels old hat and , even now , nearly five decades on ; North by Northwest is still an entertaining thriller , and that is testament to Hitchcock's endearing talent , as many of the recent films that are entertaining now , probably wont be fifty years down the line . Every set piece in the movie is beautifully engineered , and as the plot is perfectly paced ; nothing ever seems like it shouldn't be there , and North by Northwest flows excellently . The film is best remembered for stand-out sequences including the famous bi-plane scene , but even those scenes , that have been seen separate from the movie many times , don't feel like they've been tacked on when viewing the movie in it's entirety . Many movies these days have instances that are there merely to be in the trailer and such ; but here , Hitchcock is as restrained as ever , yet he still manages to insert scenes like this into the film . To be honest , I think Cary Grant got the short end of the stick with Hitchcock's films . While James Stewart got Vertigo , The Man Who Knew Too Much and Rear Window , Grant only got gifted with Suspicion , To Catch a Thief , Notorious and this film ; and while this one is very good , the rest of the Grant-Hitchcock collaborations are not among either man's best work . However , fans of both of these cinema legends can be thankful for North by Northwest , as both are on top of their game and in that instance ; only a fine film can ensue . This isn't Cary Grant's best performance ; sometimes he looks a bit out of place , and he's definitely spent too long on the sun beds - but his charm and charisma lifts even his most disappointing performances , and the one here certainly isn't one of those . Hitchcock's direction is flawless , and the film never feels clumsy or gets boring at any stage . If I was going to nit-pick , I would perhaps say that the film could have been streamlined a little bit more ; but overall , North by Northwest is an entertaining classic that all fans of cinema need to see !
423529	2248099	64888	10.0	Dark and eerie Eurohorror gem !	Director Narciso Ibáñez Serrador is most famous for his under-seen cult gem , ' Who Can Kill a Child ? ' , but this Gothic horror treat is definitely well worth tracking down ! Perhaps not as original or thought provoking as Serrador's later film , The House That Screamed presents it's situation and characters well , and the atmosphere that the director bathes every scene in is a major highlight . The film works like a cross between a film about imprisoned women ( along the same lines as Pete Walker's masterpiece ' House of Whipcord ' ) and an Italian Giallo ; although it's clear that Serrador wanted to keep the focus on the girls ' and their plight , as the murder theme exists almost like an afterthought . The film focuses on a French boarding school for wayward girls . The owner and mistress of this establishment is the unforgiving Mme Fourneau , who sees fit to enforce a strict discipline upon her pupils , which has lead to widespread deviance among the girls . The mistress is never more strict with anyone than her own son , however , who has fallen in love with one of the girls , leading his mother to tell him that he should find a girl " just like her " . . . It's amazing that this film was made in 1969 , as the production values are amazing owing to the director's care and attention to detail , and it's also clear that this film was a major inspiration for a barrage of later Gothic horror films , including Dario Argento's most famous film ' Suspiria ' . Its own influence comes from Gothic horror the likes of which the great Mario Bava is famous for producing , and the dark and gloomy look of the school bodes excellently with the themes of the plot . Lilli Palmer is the pick of the cast , and delivers an excellent strong lead performance in the lead role . She receives decent feedback from the likes of Cristina Galbó and John Moulder-Brown who , along with the rest of the support players , help to ensure that this is above a lot of Euro-sleaze being released around the same time . The murders aren't the main point of the film , and while they're not overly gory or brutal ; they work well in the context of the movie , and succeed in being extremely stylish . The film ends on a definite high , as although the identity of the murderer isn't a shock ; the reason for the killings completely caught me out and the dark and shocking finale is a treat . Overall , this masterpiece comes HIGHLY recommended to fans of cult horror !
422610	2248099	109592	10.0	There isn't another film quite like Dellamorte Dellamore	There was a distinct lack of truly great horror in the nineties ; but this film , Dellamorte Dellamore , tops the list of what little good ones there were . It's actually quite shocking that this came out during a huge depression for horror cinema , because it's easily one of the greatest horror movies I ever saw . Dellamorte Dellamore is a rather strange mix of horror , romance , twisted fairytale and comedy that isn't quite like anything else in cinema ; horror or otherwise . The film knows that it's not the usual sort of film , and revels in this fact throughout . Dellamorte Dellamore buys itself a licence do whatever it wants through the fact that it so weird , and therefore no matter what the film throws at you ; it's easy to just back and enjoy it . The film is directed by Dario Argento's talented understudy , Michele Soavi and finds an unlikely lead in Rupert Everett . The story follows Everett ; the keeper of a cemetery in a small Italian town called Buffalora . He lives there with his assistant ; the deformed Gnaghi , but this isn't quite the normal cemetery , however , as here the dead come back to life and it's up the cemetery man to put them back to sleep . When he meets the most beautiful woman he's ever seen in his cemetery , however , it appears that his luck is starting to change . The atmosphere presented in this film is truly brilliant , and one of Dellamorte Dellamore's main assets . A cemetery is always going to present a macabre location for a film's characters to inhabit , but the Gothic design in this film ensures that Buffalora's cemetery is more than the horror film norm . The way that the smoke protrudes from the graves , along with several little special effects that director Michele Soavi has seen fit to implement all help to give the film that unique ambiance that it portrays so well . Soavi has given this film it's own style throughout , and even the zombies adhere to it . Soavi's zombies , like the rest of the film , don't stick to convention and rather than being covered with blood , falling to pieces of screaming " brains ! " , these zombies really look like they've been underground , and also manage to tie in with the downbeat tone of the rest of the movie . A lot of imagination has gone into Dellamorte Dellamore , and almost every sequence is soaked in it . It's things like the way that the cemetery man's assistant takes the mayor's daughter's head from her grave and puts it in the television that makes Dellamorte Dellamore what it is , and not just any other zombie movie . Horror movies aren't known for great acting , but Dellamorte Dellamore breaks convention once again on that front . Rupert Everett puts in a performance that goes over and above what audiences have come to expect from him given his earlier roles . Like the rest of the film , he just fits in ; and if you'd never seen Everett in anything before , you would think that he made this kind of movie all the time . The fact that he isn't essentially a horror film actor only makes the performance even more impressive . Anna Falchi stars opposite him in three different female roles , and looks absolutely great in all of them . The rest of the cast is made up of lesser-known actors , with the very odd François Hadji-Lazaro standing out most among them . Director Michele Soavi started out working under the great Dario Argento , but the few films he has directed himself show that he is a bigger talent than his resume lets on . Here , for example , he has created a film that absolutely stands on it's own . Dellamorte Dellamore goes beyond the title ' horror film ' , and comes out in a sub-genre all of it's own . Films like this don't often come to the attention of the mainstream ; and that's a shame because originality like this should be praised to high heaven . Dellamorte Dellamore is a film that is impossible to ignore and , providing you can find a copy , ignoring is definitely not the recommended action !
422598	2248099	48281	10.0	Superb and immensely enjoyable Ealing comedy	Ealing studios are well known for creating brilliantly witty comedies , and this is surely one of the best of them ! The Ladykillers follows Alec Guinness and his band of crooks as they infiltrate an old woman's home and attempt to rob a bank in the process . Guinness ' plan is so brilliant that the old dear herself is included in the plot - but nothing is ever that simple , especially not when your cohorts aren't the sharpest tools in the shed . The film works from a backbone consisting of very dry black humour and some slapstick thrown in for good measure , and the result is a film that is as easy to like as it is hilariously enjoyable . Despite a recent remake , they don't make films like this anymore and seeing the dark , but still good willed humour in this film is very refreshing indeed . What the film portrays is , in a way , quite horrifying , but the way that it's done is so well timed comically that it's hard to be frightened or disgusted by the idea of a lodgers not being quite what they seem , and far easier - and more enjoyable - to simply go along with the ensemble of brilliant characters that Ealing studios had put together ! It's quite a cast that this movie has . Just being lead by Alec Guinness is impressive enough , but when you throw in the likes of Peter Sellers and Herbert Lom to help him out , the cast becomes one of the film's main assets . Guinness puts in a superb performance , which excellently sums up the movie in the way that it straddles the line between creepiness and comedy . Herbert Lom is my pick of the supporting players . He steals every scene he's in , and his " no-nonsense " persona bodes brilliantly with the film and the characters that he's surrounded by . The characters can easily be called cliché - we've got the big dumb crook , the dippy old lady etc ; but it's the way that the actors delve into the clichés that makes the performances memorable and the film a winner . Most of the laughs come about as a result of the characters and the way that they act - while the film's running joke , and the trademark Ealing ironic climax - come about through the plot . The Ladykillers is an all time classic and a film that will be enjoyed for many decades to come for that reason - it's judged it's plot and it's characters perfectly , and it's very hard on the whole to find anything wrong with this film at all .
422263	2248099	75462	10.0	Truly first rate Spanish horror !	Who Can Kill a Child starts off with a drawn out sequence depicting real life horror against children . There's quite a difference between real life and cinematic horror , and had Chicho Ibáñez-Serrador's film been cheap and nasty along the same lines as a great number of other European horror films , it would have been safe to say that the movie is in bad taste . However , not only is the introduction sequence needed ; Ibáñez-Serrador makes a point out of it that he harks back at to at several points during the movie . It has to be said that the point of the film is a little muddled and doesn't always come across ; but then again , this film could have been without point and the atmosphere and core idea alone would have ensured the film its status as a cult classic . The plot follows a holidaying couple who decide to take a boat from mainland Spain to a small island just off the coast . They soon realise that something is wrong as , other than the kids that greeted them ; the island is eerily deserted , and things worsen when it transpires that the kids are the cause of the lack of adults . . . The major standout of this film is the style . Director Chicho Ibáñez-Serrador creates a creepy atmosphere by way of the deserted streets within the clean , white location in which the film takes place . The tension then builds , and the happiness of the couple turns into despair as their situations worsens with each minute of running time . Lewis Fiander and Prunella Ransome take the lead roles , and deliver performances that are concurrent with the film . Fiander reminded me a lot of Donald Sutherland in Don't Look Now , as he continually loses control over his situation . In contrast , Ransome gives it her all as his opposite number , and the pair share a believable chemistry on screen . The director's use of the camera is superb . Ibáñez-Serrador continually develops a strong foreboding atmosphere and in doing so creates a series of memorable sequences ; the one that sees the camera caress a corpse hidden behind a store shelf towards the beginning being a particular highlight . The fact that the villains of the film are innocent looking children ensures that the film is always going to be shocking ; but the director handles the plot well , as Who Can Kill a Child never descends into comic book horror , and the use of blood is suitably restrained . Overall ; this is a movie you don't see very often - an original and truly harrowing horror picture and one that shouldn't be missed by Eurohorror fans !
423370	2248099	44079	10.0	A stunning thriller from the master of suspense	Alfred Hitchcock has made many brilliant thrillers , and many of them have gone on to be hailed as some of the greatest films of all time . One film that tends to get somewhat lost under the Vertigo's and the Psycho's is this film ; Strangers on a Train , the most compelling film that Hitchcock ever made . The story follows Guy Haines , a tennis player and a man soon to be wed to the Senator's daughter , if he can get a divorce from his current wife . One day , on the way to see his wife , he meets the mentally unstable Bruno Anthony aboard a train and soon gets drawn into a murder plot that he can neither stop nor stall ; and one that could ultimately cost him his life . The conversation aboard the train between Bruno and Guy is one of the cinema's most intriguing and thought provoking of all time . What if two people " swapped " murders , thus resolving themselves of all suspicion of the crime , and rendering their motive irrelevant ? Could this truly be the perfect murder ? What makes this film all the more frightening is that the events that Guy is lead into could happen to any , normal everyday person . Everyone has someone they'd like to get rid of , so what if you met an insane man aboard a train that does your murder for you and then forces you to do his ? The chances of it happening are unlikely , but it's the idea that anyone could be a murderer that is central to the message of Strangers on a Train ; and in this situation , anyone could . Is there any actor on earth that could have portrayed the character of Bruno Anthony any better than Robert Walker ? The man was simply born for the part . He manages to capture just the right mood for his character and absolutely commands every scene he is in . The character of Bruno is a madman , but he's not a lunatic ; he's a calculating , conniving human being and Robert Walker makes the character believable . His performance is extremely malevolent , and yet understated enough to keep the character firmly within the realms of reality . Unfortunately , Robert Walker died just one year after the release of Strangers on a Train , and I believe that is a great loss to cinema . Nobody in the cast shines as much as Walker does , but worth mentioning is his co-star Farley Granger . Granger never really impresses that much , but his performance is good enough and he holds his own against Walker . Also notable about his performance is that he portrays his character as a very normal person ; and that is how it should be . Ruth Roman is Guy's wife to be . She isn't really in the film enough to make a lasting impression , but she makes the best of what she has . Alfred Hitchcock's daughter , Patricia , takes the final role of the four central roles as Barbara , the sister of Guy's fiancé . She is suitably lovely in this role , and she tends to steal a lot of the scenes that she is in . Alfred Hitchcock's direction is always sublime , and it is very much so in this film . There is one shot in particular , that sees the murder of the film being committed in the reflection of a pair of sunglasses . This is an absolutely brilliant shot , and one that creates a great atmosphere for the scene . Hitchcock's direction is moody throughout , and very much complies with the film noir style . The climax to the film is both spectacular and exciting , and I don't think that anyone but Hitchcock could have pulled it off to the great effect that it was shown in this film . It's truly overblown , and out of turn from the rest of the movie ; but it works . There is a reason that Hitchcock is often cited as the greatest director of all time , and the reason for that is that he doesn't only use the script to tell the film's story , but he also uses to camera to do so as well . Strangers on a Train is one of the greatest thrillers ever made . Its story is both intriguing and thought provoking , and is sure to delight any fan of cinema . A masterpiece .
