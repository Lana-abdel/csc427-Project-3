422002	2248099	369226	1.0	Wow , it really is as bad as they say . . .	Having seen this and hated it is made even worse by the fact that it's all my fault . When most people hear comments about a film that are as bad as what's been said about Alone in the Dark , they'll avoid at all costs ; but for me , the bad comments really made me want to see it , just to see if it is really is as bad as they say - and surprise , surprise , it's just as bad ; if not worse . There are a number of things that can make a movie be the opposite of good , and Alone in the Dark manages to lampoon a surprising amount of them . First of all , this film is boring in a way not often seen outside of films that have the words ' Blair ' , ' Project ' and ' Witch ' in the title . It's based on a video game ( that I've never played , by the way ) , so you'd expect there to be lots of flashy and exciting scenes ; but there isn't . There are scenes that should be exciting , but it's all so downbeat that it's hard to care . Despite looking good , the film also suffers from really poor production elements , including really bad acting , a terrible script and lethargic direction , courtesy of everyone least favourite modern horror director ; the lamentable Uwe Boll . Actually ( and thankfully ) , this is the first film I've seen from Boll , and I'm not finding the idea of the rest being rubbish hard to handle . House of the Dead was lambasted upon release , so you'd expect movie producers to blacklist the director ; but instead , they gave him this film , which was also lambasted upon release . So what do they do ? They give him Bloodrayne , that gets lambasted and now I've noticed that his upcoming projects include adaptations of Postal and Fear Effect ! What's going on here ? ! I'm not a movie director , and other than what I've picked up through watching other people's films , I don't know anything about movie-making ; but I'd really like to think that even I could make a better movie than this one ( I'm available to make a video game movie , if any of Boll's producers are listening ) . This brings me to the acting . I actually rather like Christian Slater , so I really hope that he was well paid for appearing in this trash , because seeing him try to convince the audience that he's all action hero is really painful . No point in mentioning the rest of the cast . . . or anything else about this film . I wasted an hour and half on it , and it took me about ten minutes writing this . That's enough time down the drain , thanks .
422672	2248099	65483	2.0	More utter crap from Andy Milligan	Andy Milligan has firmly established himself in my mind as probably the worst horror director of all time . Despite making decent sexploitation flick ' Seeds ' in 1968 , Milligan has succeeded only in boring me to death with the rest of his crappy oeuvre since then , and this film is certainly no exception . I really don't understand this director at all ; it seems like he's trying to make some sort of point as his films all have a similar style , but somehow nothing comes out of them but boredom . Take the plot pace of this film as an example ; it's painfully slow and the dialogues are delivered by actors who sound like they're close to death . Quite how Milligan made this film and didn't realise how dull it was is anyone's guess . . . my only thought on the matter is that perhaps it was the director's intention to torture his audience ? The plot supposedly revolves around vampires but for all I care they could have been clowns , postmen , FBI agents or French maids . . . it doesn't really matter . No film made with as little enthusiasm as this is ever going to be interesting , and after seeing five Milligan films ; I doubt I'll be seeing another .
423551	2248099	83185	2.0	Terrible cannibals !	It's safe to say that cannibal films are an acquired taste , but I think it's safe to say that it is one that I have acquired . However , even I am struggling for good things to say about Cannibal Terror . The best cannibal films hail from Italy , so the fact that this one was a French and Spanish co-production may have something to do with its sub-par quality . The plot follows two would-be kidnappers who end up hiding out in a house near the jungle . However , when one of them rapes the home-owner's daughter , the bunch is left to the nearby cannibals . Cannibal Terror was one of the handful of cannibal films banned by the DPP back in the eighties . Indeed , there is some rather nasty gore on display ; but it's nowhere near as gory as the best films that this genre has to offer , and the gore is hardly shocking as the whole production is so badly done . Director Alain Deruelle never manages to impose the jungle atmosphere on his audience , and the film feels like merely a rip off of better cannibal films . Needless to say , the plot doesn't really go anywhere and the overall effect is really rather dull . Overall , I can't recommend this film as the only reason for watching is that it was once banned ! Avoid .
421750	2248099	276626	2.0	Went the Wrong Way on ripping off The Last House on the Left	Usually , I love this sort of film . . . but Wrong Way just doesn't cut it . The influence from Wes Craven's classic The Last House on the Left is clear and obvious throughout , but the film doesn't do anything new with it and overall is really rather boring . The Last House on the Left inspired a number of rape and revenge films ; the majority of which hailed from Italy and are rather good if you're into this sort of stuff . That's what makes Wrong Way all the more disappointing ; it's not a bad thing to rip off Craven's film , but when all you've got is a series of sex scenes , you know that it hasn't been done well . The plot is virtually non-existent , and simply focuses on a couple of girls that end up being raped and abused by a few bored hippies . The film is notorious for its rape scenes that go on seemingly forever , but it gets old fast . I have no problem with sex in movies , and in fact actively seek out this sort of dirty , grisly film . . . but there really is no reason to bother seeking out Wrong Way . It's currently unavailable in Britain , and that certainly isn't a bad thing .
422251	2248099	73794	3.0	Boring vampire film	Peter Cushing in a vampire movie . Sound good ? Yes I thought so too . . . until I saw Tender Dracula . This is a French film and comes across as something like an arty Hammer Horror flick . The plot focuses on two writers . They go on a trip with their girlfriends ( who both look like men in drag ) and end up at the castle of an aging actor . He is famous for portraying vampires on screen ; but as the night progresses , the group begins to wonder if the man is really acting when he is on screen . The film basically consists of eighty five minutes of boring dialogue and as you can probably imagine ; it gets boring quickly . The copy I saw was of really poor quality ; but in spite of that it's clear that the film doesn't utilise any particularly interesting locations which helps to make it more of a dull experience . The title , ' Tender Dracula ' lead me to believe that it might be some sort of soft-core porn outing , but there's no sex or nudity in the film and the title is quite inappropriate . I'd hesitate even to call this a horror film really since there's no actual horror in it . Tender Dracula is a ' lost ' film , and really that is for good reason and I doubt it will be resurfacing any time soon !
423296	2248099	112854	3.0	The radio was only playing rubbish on the set of this stinker	You know those really stupid ideas you get sometimes when you wake up in the middle of the night ? Well , you can imagine the scene : the man who would later have the idea for Destiny Turns on the Radio is asleep in his bed . He wakes up in a cold sweat one night ; " A magic swimming pool ! " , he exclaims , " . . and a cool guy can come out , and this guy be the illusive one , who holds it all together " , he's really sweating now , " and we'll get Quentin Tarantino to play him ! " . After seeing the movie , it's safe to say that it was a extremely stupid idea . As mentioned , Quentin Tarantino plays a man that comes out a swimming pool . Yes , you heard me right ; in an absolutely ridiculous sequence , Tarantino actually rises from an electricity-ridden swimming pool . The only thing more ridiculous than that sequence in this movie is Quentin Tarantino's actual performance . Tarantino has proved , time and time again , that acting isn't his forte , but he puts it beyond a shadow of a doubt here . He tries to look cool with his swagger and slow moving voice , but he actually just looks pathetic . One good thing is that he doesn't get a lot of screen time ; but the mere fact that he's in it loses the movie some of it's credibility , and this is a movie that doesn't exactly have credibility to burn . It's a shame that this movie is so terrible really , as it does have quite a good cast . Dylan McDermott , one of stars of my guiltiest pleasure , 1999's rom-com ; Three to Tango takes the lead role , with Nancy Travis ( So I Married an Axe Murderer ) as his girlfriend , James LeGros as his friend and David Cross , who I actually like a lot , is in the movie as an agent of some sort . The stupid plot isn't helped at all by a lacklustre script . Modern crime movies have become known for snappy dialogue and offbeat characters , and this movie has both ; albeit both badly done . The dialogue has some truly ridiculous lines and most of the time they are delivered badly , too . This is most probably due to the fact that most of the cast were probably cursing their agents while making this film , and have probably spent the last ten years trying to forget that Destiny ever turned on the radio . As you , the viewer , will no doubt do ; but it certainly won't take ten years . My advice ? Watch something else .
422124	2248099	66267	3.0	A boring and poorly made Italian oddity	Well , I'm a massive fan of Italian horror ; particularly Giallo and Gothic horror , so I was looking forward to this given that it's meant to be a sort of cross-over between the two . However , my hopes were dashed as Something is Creeping in the Dark is one boring and poorly made film ! I spent an hour and a half watching this film , and yet I really have very little to say about it . The plot is wafer thin and simply focuses on the idea of a bunch of strangers being holed up in a spooky old house for the night . However , they're not the only ones there are some ghostly presence is there too ! That's it really . The attempts to build up the characters and their relationships all fall flat , and all that is left to admire is the atmosphere ; which isn't exactly anything to write home about as it's a carbon copy of the atmosphere in any number of similar films and director Mario Colucci fails to bring anything new to the table . The film was obviously made on a low budget and there certainly is worse films out there - but I seriously can see no reason to bother tracking this oddity down as there's many , many better films out there too !
422923	2248099	118025	3.0	Messy , silly , illogical rubbish . Disappointment from the talented team behind Maniac Cop	Uncle Sam represents the only non-Maniac Cop collaboration between Larry Cohen and William Lustig , which is a shame . Aside from just making a derivative psycho killer film , it seems obvious that writer Larry Cohen wanted Uncle Sam to have some brains too , which is shown by the attempt to inject a message into the proceedings . Larry Cohen is definitely a huge talent when it comes to entertaining horror movies - films like The Stuff , It's Alive and , of course , Maniac Cop are camp classics if you ask me ; but he really should stick to entertainment , as this screenplay is a mess and the ' message ' is so jumbled up that I have little idea what exactly it's preaching . The plot follows a young boy who believes that his uncle , who is coincidentally called Sam , is a hero . Uncle Sam was a patriotic , lunatic soldier killed by friendly fire whilst fighting for his country . His body is brought to his sister's place , coincidentally around the time of the Fourth of July celebrations . It's not long before his fellow Americans are abusing their privileges , and Uncle Sam decides to get up and do something about it . It's hard to take a movie about a war veteran zombie seriously , and this is something that Cohen should have taken into account when putting pen to paper . The clear message on show is that war is bad , and there appears to be a backhanded comment about the way America handles people who don't submit to their ' way of life ' . However , American politicians can rest easy because the central figure here is murdering people pretty much at random ; which saps any weight out of the theme . In my opinion , Cohen should have decided what it is he wanted to write ; a slasher , or a film with substance . However , even as a horror film , Uncle Sam falls short . We've got some nice gore scenes on display , but much of the running time is spent on building up the plot with the kid and his admiration for Uncle Sam , and to say the least ; it isn't very interesting . The film is very slow to start , with practically nothing happening in the first half of the film . Good sequences are few and far between , but I've got to say I liked the one that saw a stilt-wearing pervert prying into a girl's bedroom and the one that saw someone falling down a hill in a sack race . Neither of those grab you ? This film won't either . Uncle Sam fails on every level .
422192	2248099	109275	3.0	A sequel most foul !	Introducing one of the most redundant sequels ever made ! I have to say , when I first heard that Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece ' The Birds ' had a made for TV sequel , I didn't quite believe it - but unfortunately , it turns out that it is true , and it's every bit as bad you would expect it to be . Gone is the gripping tension filled atmosphere of the original , and in its place is a whole host of terrible cringe-worthy performance , some atrocious dialogue and a plot that , while essentially the same as the one featured in the original film , isn't even a fraction as interesting second time round . The plot focuses on a family which comprises a mother , a father , a dog and two irritating daughters . They've decided to retreat to retreat to Lands End , which will enable him to write an important biology thesis , and for the family to get over the death of their son . However , they soon discover that Land's End isn't the serene paradise they thought it would be - as the local flocks of birds have once again , for some unknown reason , decided to begin attacking the people that live there . The oddest thing about this film is the fact that Tippi Hedren is in it . She must have really needed the money , as taking a role in this film is certainly an ill-advised career move . When the director's credit goes to the anonymous Alan Smithee , you can't count on good direction - and I certainly don't blame Rick Rosenthal ( Halloween 2 ) for disowning this film . The majority of The Birds II concerns the audience cringing while the untalented stars reel off line after line of excruciating dialogue . None of the cast outside Hedren manage anything resembling a memorable performance - and if it wasn't for The Birds star's performance in the first film , she wouldn't either . Quite why she takes an entirely unrelated role is anyone's guess , but at least that fact makes The Birds II slightly less of a blemish on Hitchcock's original . There's a fair bit of violence , but none of it is very interesting and overall , I'm still not sure why I watched this film . Maybe curiosity , maybe just for completion purposes . . . who knows ? But I would recommend simply watching the original again rather than watching this .
423870	2248099	182996	3.0	A derivative and stupid slasher flick	The first murder scene in this movie sees a young kid have his arm viciously chopped off . We then move onto a shot with the kid flailing around with a horribly fake stump attached to his shoulder . This scene pretty much sums up the entire movie ; a movie so terrible that only people trying to track down every film on the DPP infamous ' Video Nasty ' list will bother to see it . And I've no idea who would bother persevering with that pointless endeavour . . . ho hum . Don't Go in the Woods . . . Alone is yet another film that will only be seen because it was once banned , and that makes it's banning pretty ironic . One thing that the British censors obviously don't take into account on their moronic crusade to nanny the country is the fact that mere blood and gore don't make a shocking film ; the gore here is rather extreme , but you'd have to be a complete idiot to take it seriously . The plot follows a bunch of kids ( played by adults ) who go off into the woods on a camping trip . However , in a very original plot twist ; it turns out that there's a homicidal maniac on the loose ! Don't Go in the Woods . . . Alone is basically a bunch of death scenes , populated by a load of filler scenes in between , which fail to build characters or plot . It's a shame with regards to the gore sequences , as some of them are good in theory ; but due to exceedingly poor special effects , most of them turn out terribly . Also , the fact that the film throws these scenes at you one after the other means that it isn't long before they get really , really boring . The fact that we couldn't care less about the characters doesn't exactly help in this respect . Slashers and serial killer flicks are a penny a dozen , but this one is painfully obviously just an excuse to cash in on the schlock horror craze that was abundant in the eighties . Everything about the movie is purely derivative ; from the woodlands setting that was put to such great use in films like The Evil Dead , to the animalistic killers that were brought to the screen far better in films like The Hills Have Eyes . The film only lasts for eighty minutes , but its eighty minutes not very well spent and unless you have a good reason to see the film ; there really is no reason to track it down .
423151	2248099	377749	3.0	Just another dull ghost story - nothing to see here !	The tagline for Dead Birds pretty much says it all . " There are worse things than dying " shows a complete lack of imagination , which is something common throughout this mundane movie . Ghost stories , particularly modern ones , tend to be rather boring and this film doesn't do anything to dispute that fact . The fact that it's set in the past also goes some way to ensuring that Dead Birds isn't very good . The period setting doesn't do the plot any favours , and it would have been far easier to relate to a more modern setting . Horror films set in the past tend to be rubbish , and again ; this film doesn't do anything to dispute that . The plot line has been seen a million times before in other films , and , I'm sure , will go on to be used again and again , despite being old and tired . The plot follows a group of bank robbers that hole up in a farmhouse overnight after a storm impedes their escape into Mexico . Of course , this isn't just any house and because of the ' terrible ' atrocities that happened there ( blah blah blah ) , our heroes find themselves the victims of the ghosts that inhabit the house . Blah . Blah . Blah . For some reason , people tend to think this sort of horror is good . Of course , there has been some good examples ; The Shining , for example . But that film had far more going for it than just the plot line itself . Recent examples of this sort of film , which include the likes of The Grudge ( Jap version and remake ) and Deathwatch , are very trite and dull films and once you've seen one ; you've seen them all . You just know what's going to happen before going into this film , and the film doesn't surprise us at all . We've got loads of people with white faces , some " shocking " imagery and a bunch of dull actors portraying a bunch of dull characters . You would think that , since this film has pretty much been made before , the writer and director team of Simon Barrett and Alex Turner would be keen to do something a little different this time round . Quite why they're happy to just make ' another ghost movie ' is anyone's guess , but the best way to show your disapproval is simply not to bother seeing this film . You might have heard that this is one of the better horrors of this decade , but it's not . You heard it here first - forget about this movie . . . . you'll wish you did .
422951	2248099	70039	4.0	Boredom Rises from the Tomb	Paul Naschy made a great number of horror films . In terms of quality , they tend to range from fairly good to unwatchable trash ; and unfortunately , Horror Rises from the Tomb is closer to the latter . The plot is just your average story of a witch , wizard or ( as is the case here ) warlock , who is put to death - but not before swearing vengeance on those who did it . . . etc etc . We then get a séance and one thing leads to another , and pretty soon the executed warlock is up to no good again . The plot is slow , painfully boring and the film constantly feels pointless . The characters string out reams of diatribe and it never serves the film in any way whatsoever . Paul Naschy wrote the script , and if you ask me he should stick to acting because the dialogue is trite in the extreme , and only serves to make the film even more boring than it already is . Carlos Aured , who also directed Naschy in Blue Eyes of the Broken Doll and Curse of the Devil provides dull direction here , which likes the dialogue does nothing to help the film . Sometimes crap films like this have a certain charm about them ; but Horror Rises from the Tomb doesn't even have that . This is a painfully boring film that has little or nothing in the way of interest .
422099	2248099	74829	4.0	Tedious and dull exploitation nonsense	This film ends with a speech in which the narrator tells us the fates of two of the lead characters and that the names of people and places have been changed . . . before telling us that relation to actual people and events are purely coincidental . This ending line actually sums up everything that has gone before it ; as Rino Di Silvestro's messy film completely lacks vision , and if there is any point to the plot ; it wasn't put there on purpose . Werewolf Woman is often seen as a guilty pleasure or a ' so bad it's good ' film , but I completely disagree . Normally , I enjoy films like this ; but Werewolf Woman is indeed a bad film , and despite all the sex and savagery on display ; it doesn't even make for a fun watch , and that really is unforgivable . The film really doesn't have much plot , but the thin sliver we are given involves a young woman , who also happens to dream that she is a werewolf . She dreams of going out and finding men , having sex with them and eventually killing them . Back in the real world , she falls in love , but her lover is killed and she goes out for revenge . . . The film is made up of scenes of sex and gore , which are padded out with extremely dull talking sequences in which various characters mull over the recent events . These scenes are probably there to forward the plot and build characters ; but they really don't do that , and succeed only in turning what could have been a passable exploitation romp into an extremely underwhelming film . It would seem that the director was more interested in style and atmosphere than the plot , and this is shown by the fact that the film looks and sounds nice . The sex scenes are often overlong and not very erotic , but the gore works well . The premise is ripe for giving way to a very sexy slice of exploitation , as there's plenty of naked women , and the fact that the central character has a werewolf origin means that there could be plenty of erotica ; but this isn't capitalised on , and while I can stomach huge doses of bad acting and poorly done plot lines , I really can't stand watching films and being bored . Overall , I wouldn't even recommend this film to big exploitation fans . There's plenty of better stuff than this out there , and while the title may sound intriguing - the film isn't .
422747	2248099	67511	4.0	One of the most boring Giallo's ever made !	Everything I'd read about this film prior to seeing it pointed to it being rubbish , but after reading the plot description ; I figured that it might actually be OK . However , I was wrong . The plot sounds like Cold Eyes of Fear could be a gritty cross between the Giallo and the slew of ' house ' films ( e . g . House on the Edge of the Park , The Last House on the Beach ) whereby criminal ( s ) take innocents hostage inside their home . It sort of is a cross between these genres ; but it's so damned boring that any positives that may have come from this are instantly sucked away . The film takes place in London , which is unfortunate as it means that we're ' treated ' to a load of phoney British accents . It really annoys me that some people actually think we talk like this ! Anyway , the plot focuses on Peter ; a young man who picks up an Italian hooker and takes her back to his place . However , they arrive to find a criminal in wait for them . Peter's father , a judge , then sends a copper to sort the situation ; but the man who turns up is an impostor , hell-bent on revenge . . . The film actually gets off to a good start . . . but that then turns out to be a stage show , and that pretty much sums the entire film up . Other directors have proved many times that the Giallo can be wholly entertaining , despite the often rubbish plots ; but Castellari shows here that they can be really boring too ! It's a shame really , as the director has proved himself to me with a trio of great crime films ( The Big Racket , Street Law and The Heroin Busters ) , as well as one of the best Jaws rip offs in the form of The Last Shark - but the man obviously can't handle Giallo . It's strange that a man with such a penchant for violent action would make a film so boring , and perhaps one of the reason why it is so boring is that a lot of the main ' action ' focuses on talking , and Castellari is obviously better suited to shooting car chases and fist fights . The acting is as crap as you would expect , and this isn't helped at all by the awful dubbing . Not even Morricone's score is up to much . Overall , don't bother with this one - there are FAR better Giallo's out there !
423145	2248099	261575	4.0	BLOODLESS Voyage !	Obviously , you can't go into a completely obscure and very cheap film like this and expect anything other than crap ; but even though crap is exactly what I got , I still have to say that I'm a little bit disappointed . Maybe it's because the plot has the potential to be good ; I mean , it doesn't get much more claustrophobic than a yacht out in the middle of the ocean and many films have proved that a murder mystery is a more than adequate backbone for a horror film . . . but this one doesn't want to take the ball and run with it . The plot is purely mundane despite the ingenuity of the setting , and simply follows a bunch of murders on a pleasure cruise . Naturally , the remaining cruisers want to know who's committing the murders , and this curiosity leads them to turn on one another . Director Frank Mitchell ( unsurprisingly , his only credit as director ) fails to generate any intrigue through the atmosphere and doesn't manage to pull a good performance out of anyone in the film . The plot moves at snail pace and despite the fact that this is supposed to be a murder themed horror movie - there's only one scene that features blood in the entire movie ! And you hardly get to see anything anyway ! On the plus side , the film is completely undemanding and very short . . . but its definitely not worth seeing .
423093	2248099	75334	4.0	A huge Hammer misfire	Over the years , Hammer studios have provided us with some true classics within the horror genre . However , if this is the only Hammer film you've ever seen , then you'd be forgiven for thinking otherwise . All the things that make Hammer horror great are absent from this movie ; it lacks charm , originality and it isn't intelligent or imaginative . It's a shame too , because the plot isn't a bad one . It involves a satanic cult that is posing as a Christian church and has chosen a child to ' become the devil ' upon her eighteenth birthday . However , now that time has come and her father has decided that he wants to back out of the deal , only the cult isn't going to let him . So , as you can see , we have devil worshippers , sacrifice , Christopher Lee as the head of the cult , the devil himself even makes an appearance . . . this is great horror stuff , and if it had the right handling , it might have been able to capitalise on it's premise ; but as it happens , it did not . The main reason it fails is that it's just so DULL . The film takes ages to get anywhere , and by the time something does happen , you don't care because you're so bored . Speaking of being bored , Christopher Lee doesn't exactly approach his role in this film with gusto and his performance , although still malevolent as Lee always is , pretty much is the epitome of this film ; bored . As usual with Hammer , the production values are low ; but usually it doesn't matter as you can forgive the film for it , and even like it , depending on the film ; but here , since the rest of the film is so bad ; it's hard to forgive the bad production values . When the devil does appear , it's so ridiculous that all you will be able to do is laugh . I never thought I'd see the devil as a glove puppet ! There are no real standout moments in this film , and even the ending isn't any good . I was expecting it to at least end with a bang after making us sit through nearly ninety minutes of boredom , but no . I recommend this film to people that want to see every Hammer Horror movie ever made . Everyone else should avoid like the plague .
423862	2248099	70195	5.0	Dreary horror comedy	Well . . . despite the fact that many people find this film funny , I really can't say it did much at all for me . I found The House in Nightmare Park to be derivative , unimaginative and really rather boring - Frankie Howerd in the lead role didn't do much for me either . Horror films ( and horror comedies ) about a family / bunch of people in an old house always seem to revolve around a hidden fortune , and this film is no different , which is a shame . The film is directed by Peter Sykes , who also directed two of the lesser Hammer films in To The Devil a Daughter and Demons of the Mind , and while this film is actually slightly better than those two ; it didn't do anything to improve my opinion of the man at the helm . The plot focuses on Foster Twelvetrees , an actor who is hired by the mysterious and sinister Henderson family to perform at the house . It soon transpires that somewhere on the property is buried treasure , and naturally everyone in the house wants to find it - and they're happy to do that , even if it does mean bumping off the others in the process . The film is meant to be a horror comedy , although it doesn't provide a balance between the two - rather , it's a comedy with some atmosphere and a creaky old house thrown in . Frankie Howerd is a popular comedian for a reason , but all the same ; his style of humour doesn't appeal to me much . There's nothing particularly wrong with his performance in this film ; he leads it well and keeps things mostly interesting . There aren't a great deal of standout moments in the film and a lot of the jokes aren't funny . The plot moves well , but it's always obvious where it's going , especially for me since I've seen this sort of thing many times before . Ray Milland pops up in a supporting role and gives the film a bit of much needed class . The locations aren't bad and the country house itself is a foreboding presence . The ending doesn't come as much of a surprise , although the build up to it is the best part of the film . The House in Nightmare Park has its fans , but as I've made quite clear - I'm not one of them !
423795	2248099	95270	5.0	Nice style but that's about it !	Hairspray marks something of a departure for director John Waters ; a man best known for his ' bad taste ' pictures such as Pink Flamingos and Female Trouble . The film still features Waters ' style , but the bad taste is massively toned down and the whole feel of the movie could be described as ' John Waters Lite ' . The film is set in 1962 Baltimore and music is the major focus of the film . Waters obviously realised that the style of it would be the major attraction ; and as such has taken time to lay it on as thick as possible , and this blends well with the music and storyline . The plot focuses on a corny music show enjoyed by the teens in Baltimore . ' Pleasantly plump ' Tracy Turnblad is one of the many obsessed by this show and sets out to get a role as one of the dancers . She achieves her goal and soon becomes a local hero , but she loses some friends when she decides to use her success in order to speak out for what she believes in - namely social integration . While John Waters ' style is one of the best things about the movie , in another way it's one of the worst . In his earlier films , the content is generally distracting enough for the audience not to really notice the rather boring directorial style ; but this film doesn't have that , and while the style is a big enough distraction at first ; it soon becomes clear that the plot is rather lacking and the film becomes dull before we even reach the halfway point . Hairspray stars Ricki Lake in the lead role , and she does a rather good job with it . The role doesn't require any great acting talents , but she is at least bright and breezy for the duration . The rest of the cast is filled out nicely by an eclectic list of names , which includes Debbie Harry , Divine , Pia Zadora and even the director himself in an amusing role as a psychologist . The message regarding segregation may well be a good one ; but really it's not all that interesting and isn't put forward particularly well , and that's where the film falls down . Overall , I do like the style of the film and appreciate the ideas behind it ; but it's not well executed and I don't rate it among Waters ' best efforts .
422606	2248099	95344	5.0	Flat remake	This film is a remake of the 1965 William Castle classic of the same title . It was made for TV , although that's not such a big problem on paper as the plot is very simple and there's not a lot of room for bloodshed anyway . The film also features a distinctly eighties style , which firmly puts the story in the time in which the film was made . Unfortunately , however , the focus of the film is spread thinly over a lot of different areas and as a result ; the central plot suffers as its not fleshed out very well and the characters suffer too as we never really get to know anything about them . The plot focuses on two kids babysitting a younger one . They're bored and decide to get some kicks by making prank phone calls . The game soon gets round to " I know what you did " , which involves phoning someone and simply saying that phrase . Unfortunately , however , they decide to call a Mr Adrian Lancer , a disturbed man that happens to have just murdered his wife . . . The original film featured the same basic plot , so to call this one unlikely and the original not would be unfair . However , the fact that the original is so much better handled means that this version really struggles to get the plot across . The big coincidence of the girls ' game and the murder isn't glossed over with any kind of gimmick which makes it stand out like a sore thumb . Furthermore , the girls themselves have very little character and Robert Carradine looks bored in his role as the murderer and so doesn't bring forward any tension or suspense . The plot is played rather straight for most of the film , which means things rather just drone on and it gets tiresome quickly . Tammy Lauren stands out in her role , though that's only because of her awful eighties haircut , while Shawnee Smith is mostly incognito . It soon becomes clear that the film isn't going to present any surprises and indeed the ending is rather typical . We do finish off with a final twist that is both nonsensical and redundant . Overall , I highly recommend giving the original a look if you want a fun lightweight thriller ; but don't bother tracking this version down .
422336	2248099	104549	5.0	Boring thriller , not an underrated classic or hidden gem !	Jennifer Eight seems to often get described as a ' sleeper ' - and I agree with that description , although not for the same reason . This film is not a hidden gem ; the reason it hasn't matured with a good reputation is simple ; for a thriller , there's just not enough excitement . Bruce Robinson's film is very well made ; it has a good cast and they all perform well , but that really counts for nothing when the story is not interesting enough to keep the audience interested for the overlong two hour running time . Our central character is John Berlin ; a police detective on the trail of a serial killer . The severed hand of a young girl has turned up in a parking lot and the detective soon starts to believe that the murder may be connected to an unsolved case that happened in the town some years previously . His investigation leads him to a blind institute where he meets and is attracted to a young blind girl named Helena . His suspicions about the new murder being connected to the old are not well received by his fellow cops ; although he soon fears that Helena may be in danger . Director Bruce Robinson is best known as the writer and director of the seminal classic Withnail & I , but apparently his writing skills don't lend themselves to the crime genre very well . Jennifer Eight suffers from far too many drawn out and boring scenes where nothing really much happens , and even the film's most exciting moments aren't exactly exciting . The major problem is the fact that the film tries to blend two big story lines and doesn't have the capacity to do so . The romance between the police officer and the blind girl takes up far too much time and is both boring and plotted out in an unlikely manner . This leaves the murder plot almost a spare wheel in it's own film , and the way that the plot takes another turn midway through only helps to distract more , meaning that by the end we don't really care who the murderer is . The film's saving grace is the acting . I've never been a fan of Andy Garcia but he's solid in the lead role and gets good back-up from the always reliable Lance Henriksen . Uma Thurman doesn't really get to do much other than play the token ' victim ' blind girl , and John Malkovich steals the show once he gets on screen . Overall , this film really is a big disappointment and doesn't really deserve digging up any time soon .
422773	2248099	109297	5.0	Blink , and you'll miss the good parts .	The main reason I saw this film was not because I thought the plot sounded interesting , or even because of the fact that it stars the beautiful Madeleine Stowe ; the reason I saw it is purely down to the fact that I remembered seeing posters for it in the video store when I was a kid . With such a nonchalant viewing reason behind me , it probably wont come as a surprise that I wasn't expecting a lot from this film ; and it's a good job as Blink is a highly disappointing thriller with numerous problems and very little to recommend it for . The plot is not particularly original , and focuses on the idea of a blind woman in peril . There is a slight twist on this theme ; as the woman in this film is not quite blind ; in fact , she is the benefactor of a breakthrough ' eye transplant ' , which re-enables her sight after over twenty years of being blind . A side effect of this treatment is the fact that she sees some things ' by memory ' , and this is a problem when she apparently witnesses a murder as she's not sure if it's real or just flashback . . . The film would be described a ' psychological thriller ' , and the reason why these films are often hit and miss is the main problem with this one . A film like this really needs a central character that is easy to get into ; and while I believe that Madeleine Stowe is a great actress , she's not given the room to do much with this role . The plotting is not good at all , and is often all over the place ; and too much of the film focuses on the tentative ( and boring ) relationship between the central character and a policeman on the case . This relationship feels extremely phoney , and since it makes up a large proportion of the running time of the film ; it becomes a pretty big problem . There are a few decent scenes ; Stowe is very good despite the poor material , though I would have preferred a lot more suspense , given that this is really supposed to be a thriller . The ending is pulled off fairly nicely , though its impact is lessened by the tepid film that preceded it . For a far better take on a similar theme , see the fantastic ' Wait Until Dark ' , and skip this .
422285	2248099	74501	5.0	Disappointing D'Amato sleaze	When Laura Gemser and Joe D'Amato team up to make a movie ; you can bet that no matter what the movie is about or what character Gemser is playing that some of the alternate titles will include the word ' Emanuelle ' . And this film is no exception , as it got branded with the unimaginative title ' Emmanuelle Goes Japanese ' . Naturally , the film has nothing to do with Gemser's most famous character and thankfully the title Black Cobra Woman is generally the more accepted one - and the one that I saw the film under . From the plot description I was actually thinking that this film might be half decent . . . and it does at least get off to a decent start . The film focuses on Judas ; a rich man who surrounds himself with exotic snakes but has little contact with people . One night , Judas goes with his brother to see an act at a nightclub that involves a beautiful woman dancing with a snake . Naturally , he is immediately taken in by this woman ( she's played by Laura Gemser so this part of the film is quite realistic ) and decides to take her back to his home . . . Laura Gemser takes the lead role and spends most of the film either naked , getting it on with other women or both ; which is all well and good , but anyone familiar with Gemser's filmography will have seen it all so many times before and it's particularly disappointing in this film as we actually have the basis for a decent plot here . One of the more bizarre casting decisions is represented by Jack Palance , who I guess was either not getting a lot of work around the time or just couldn't resist a starring role alongside the beautiful Laura Gemser . Naturally for a Joe D'Amato flick , it features plenty of sleaze and it's really all encompassing so there wouldn't really have been room to flesh out the story even if the director wanted to . The film does at least deliver on the title's implied promise of featuring snakes ; and seeing Gemser dance with a big Cobra is worthwhile . A scene that sees a snake skinned alive and cooked was a bit needless , though . Overall , however , this film is not really worthwhile ; it's better than some of the lesser Emanuelle flicks , but that's not really saying anything . I can't recommend tracking Black Cobra Woman down .
422210	2248099	57302	5.0	Torturous Tomb of Torture	One of the reasons I am a fan of Italian horror is for films like this ; though this particular example is not one of the better ones . The film is directed by Antonio Boccaci and also doubles up as his only directing credit ; which isn't really surprising as despite having a recipe for success to work with , he doesn't implement much style or suspense into the proceedings and the result is sadly underwhelming . It's also really slow , and the bulk of the film consists of not a lot of interesting things happening . Tomb of Torture takes place mostly in and around an old Gothic castle . The film gets off to a fairly good start as we get treated to a macabre sequence that sees two girls tortured to death . The plot then takes a familiar turn as we fast forward some years into the future , but the focus still remains on the eerie castle from the beginning . We find out that the Countess went missing years ago and the new female lead is a young girl who happens to look just like the missing countess and who goes to the castle on the advice of her doctor . . . The black and white cinematography is undoubtedly one of the best things about this film and helps it immensely when it comes to the atmosphere . This bodes well with the eerie castle , as well as the shots of the torture ; which is expected considering the title . However , these two elements actually don't mix as well as they should as the director doesn't direct with much verve and this isn't helped by the slow plotting . The main antagonist is a weird looking deformed hunchback who wanders around the castle grounds unseen . Like the main plot , this one is also derivative and it's also not made good use of as nothing really comes of it and the hunchback itself looks more silly than foreboding ( looks kind of like the poor man's Wolf Man ) . The acting is passable but nothing to write home about with all the leads doing their job and not much more . It takes a long time ( or at least it seems to ) before the ending is finally upon us , and while it does offer up a suitable climax to the film ; it doesn't really justify the eighty minutes that came before it . Overall , this is actually quite a boring movie and I certainly would not recommend anyone goes out of their way to see it .
423579	2248099	64949	5.0	All that was left in the tank after The Oblong Box	After the excellent adaptation of Edgar Allen Poe's ' The Oblong Box ' earlier in 1969 , director Gordon Hessler would team up again , in the same year , with horror legend's Vincent Price and Christopher Lee for this second feature . This time , fellow legend Peter Cushing joins the already impressive line up , which allows Scream and Scream Again to be one of the few films to profess starring roles from all three British legends . However , all is not as it seems as Peter Cushing appears in the movie for all of about one minute and the other two stars don't appear for much more than one minute either . The majority of the acting is left to an unknown cast , meaning that , basically , the three big names are only in the movie for the sake of the poster ; which is something that I find very irritating indeed . The wayward plot follows something to do with a Nazi-esquire group that wants world domination and a Frankenstein-esquire scientist that is attempting to build a race of super-humans . Or something . This movie is very messy indeed and although it never becomes boring , there is a number of occasions when the audience is forced to ask themselves what exactly is going on , and why . The lack of plot shows through at times as the film features an overlong chase sequence midway through , and ends with a nice , but rather off with the rest of the film , mad scientist scene . The film meanders through it's two basic plot lines , but it doesn't fit together well because the stories have very little to do with one another . The sixties swing atmosphere is nice , but it isn't very horrific and doesn't create the best atmosphere for a horror movie . The music isn't very good either , and it throws any chance of capturing a mood of malevolence out of the window and replaces it with a very tacky feel . If you haven't guessed it already , I'm basically saying that this film isn't very good . I hate to pass bad comments about a film that includes three of the best actors of all time , but I'd be lying if I didn't .
423748	2248099	69792	5.0	Mosrly dull blaxpolitation flick	I can't say I'm a fan of " Blaxploitation " films , and indeed this one is one of my very few forays into the genres . It didn't change my opinion much either ; what we have here is basically a crime thriller along the same lines as Scarface , except most of the main players are black . The film appealed to me mainly because of the fact that it's written and directed by Larry Cohen who also wrote and directed some of my favourite low budget trash films ; films such as It's Alive , The Stuff , Q and The Ambulance . This is an early Cohen film and it appears he didn't get much chance to refine his craft as despite a decent directional debut with ' Bone ' a year earlier ; this film mostly fits the ' trash ' bill in the bad way . The lead character is Tommy Gibbs , who starts off a young kid and gets his leg broken by a copper during a robbery . He's not best pleased and upon his return several years later , he decides to rise to power himself in order to put up a fight against the powers that stand already ; both the criminal and the law enforcement . Aside from the fact that the film didn't appeal to me much , it's also badly written and doesn't make up for in originality what it lacks in substance . As mentioned , I'm not well versed in this genre ; but I imagine it's more about style than anything else and Larry Cohen does at least give the film a cool vibe that is well done . James Brown features heavily on the soundtrack and it works with the film , although the scenes involving " The Boss " only served in reminding me of how Lock , Stock and Two Smoking Barrels used the song much better . The lead role is taken by Fred Williamson and it does have to be said that he's one of the best things about the film . The central role in this film does require someone ' cool ' to play it , and Williamson certainly is that person . The plot is a problem because it's never exactly difficult to tell where it's going and this results in the film not having a great deal of suspense . Cohen's script doesn't really make us care for the lead character either , which means it doesn't really matter where the film goes . This might appeal to fans of this genre but it hasn't made me want to see more it . . . I don't recommend this one .
422581	2248099	265029	5.0	Decent throwaway entertainment	John Cusack and Catherine Zeta-Jones are Gwen Harrison and Eddie Thomas ; a pair of actors that are collectively known as " America's Sweethearts " , due to how well loved they are by their adoring public . However , all is not as rosy as it once was for America's favourite couple , as she has taken a Spanish lover , which has resulted in him entering into a spiral of depression . The situation of their break-up gets worse when the director of their new film has decided to withhold it until they are brought back together . Enter Lee Phillips ( Billy Crystal ) ; the movie publicist faced with the task of getting them back together while trying to keep the press - that want to see the new movie - at bay . However , all is not to simple as that , as Eddie is having his head turned by Gwen's sister , ' kiki ' . . . America's Sweethearts is a nice film , but it's one that suffers from too much attempted satire , and not a lot of jokes that work . Billy Crystal co-wrote the script and strangely , he seems to have given himself the short end of the stick , jokes wise . The cast of America's Sweethearts is good on the whole . John Cusack adds to every movie that he's in ; his charisma and style are great and it's always nice to see him on screen . Catherine Zeta-Jones is an overrated actress , but luckily this role doesn't require her to do much more than look nice , which she does nicely . Billy Crystal , whom I've already mentioned and Julia Roberts make up the rest of the leads and support is given to them by Seth Green , Hank Azaria , the excellent and underrated Alan Arkin and Christopher Walken in a hammy and memorable cameo as the director at the film's centre . The satire side of the movie is good , but it flirts with missing the mark throughout the film . The overblown finale is nice and the way that the film shows the media handling things , not to mention the ' films ' that it shows Eddie and Gwen in at the start are highlights . If you want to enjoy yourself for ninety minutes with an enjoyable piece of fluff , you could do a lot worse than this . Of course , you could do a lot better ; but this isn't a complete waste of time .
422127	2248099	79156	5.0	This lake ain't placid !	A year after The Mountain of the Cannibal God , Sergio Martino decided to go back into the jungle - although instead of bloodthirsty cannibals , this time he brought with him a ridiculous looking fake crocodile ! The influence from this film obviously came primarily from Steven Spielberg's Jaws ( which was a big hit among Italian film directors in the seventies ) , with a bit of the cannibal sub-genre thrown in for good measure . It's safe to say that this film isn't very good - and has nothing on Sergio Martino's more successful films ( his Giallo's in particular ) , but at least the film is fun enough for most of the duration . The plot revolves around a legendary crocodile that lives near a tourist resort in Africa . Unfortunately , the over-sized crocodile is not pleased about the tourists ' intrusion and so takes it upon itself to kill everyone ! On the land , the natives believe that they are being killed by the tourists and so they take to the lake in a boat . . . but in the lake , the hungry crocodile awaits them ! Of Martino's three jungle movies ( the other two being The Mountain of the Cannibal God and Island of the Fish Men ) , this one is definitely the weakest , although it's not all bad news as it's still entertaining enough . Naturally , the crocodile looks completely ridiculous but this adds charm to the film and I'd rather see a silly looking and obviously fake crocodile terrorising people than a CGI one . Unlike Martino's other films , this one doesn't feature much in the way of gore , nudity or sleaze which is a shame as I would have preferred more of all three . Like Island of the Fish Men , this film stars Barbara Bach and again she looks absolutely great . Her co-star is Claudio Cassinelli ( also from Island of the Fish Men , as well as Mountain of the Cannibal God ) and he looks the part as the rugged male lead . The scenery is good and the film is obviously shot on location , which helps Sergio Martino to build the atmosphere surrounding the " mythical " central monster . Overall , The Big Alligator River is silly and fairly poor quality , but it's a fun viewing and therefore isn't all bad .
422145	2248099	839880	5.0	The 13th to Last Lakeside Massacre on the Left	Lake Dead is clearly a rip off of much better films such as The Last House on the Left and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre ; but to be honest some of my favourite films are rip offs of those films so I wasn't too worried going into it . That was until I realised that most of my favourite rip offs ( films like The House on the Edge of the Park and Death Weekend ) were made during the heyday of horror when even a talentless bunch of hacks could churn out something good with a decent location and a fistful of film stock . Unfortunately the makers of Lake Dead weren't able to follow suit ; but to the film's credit , it's entertaining enough stuff and I cant really criticise it too much considering the type of film it is . The plot focuses very simply on three sisters who go with their friends to check out a motel left to them by their grandfather ; who just so happened to have died a rather grisly death . The sisters have their eyes on a big sale price ; but get a surprise once they arrive at the motel when they discover that their long lost relatives are a bunch of psychos . . . Anyone with more than a passing interest in this type of film will have seen most of what happens here many times before , which is a bit of a shame because the director obviously had good intentions and the film might have been decent with just a little bit of originality . The characters are all very samey and clichéd and thus hard to care about , or follow . The three sisters are very nice looking at least . . . but this novelty wears off pretty quickly . The setting is good however and the cinematography is nice and crisp . . . although actually a gritty style would have suited the film better . The psychotic relatives are not all that interesting either and pale in comparison even to the family in the remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre . The gore is well used and fairly realistic and there's a fair few death scenes featuring including one that sees someone have his face caved in with the blunt end of a shotgun . However , it's the lack of originality that ultimately condemns the film and if you're looking for something you haven't seen before ; feel free to look elsewhere .
422864	2248099	131510	5.0	Yet another Italian Exorcist rip-off	After the release of The Exorcist in 1973 ; ripping that film off became so popular in Italy that " the Exorcist rip off " almost became a genre . It turns out that Italian filmmakers were still at it six years later and Rings of Darkness is one of the later rip offs . It seems that director Pier Carpi was not happy just to rip off William Friedkin's film , however , and this one also features elements from other Satanic classics such as The Omen and Rosemary's Baby . I have to give the film some credit actually for the plot , as it does feature one of the more interesting ones ; although it is rather messy . The basic plot focuses on three women that made a deal with the Devil . However , the Devil has decided to target their young daughters instead ; prompting the women to fight back against their master . Unfortunately , it has to be said that this film is something of a missed opportunity and nowhere near as good as it could have been . The atmosphere is really rather good , and while the music is a bit too over the top at times ; it does work well . The plot soon becomes indecipherable , however , and unfortunately this means that the film quickly becomes boring . In my experience , most of the Exorcist rip off's are rubbish and this isn't one of the better ones . I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to find a copy .
421754	2248099	365137	6.0	Robert Louis Stevenson would be proud ! . . . . or not .	I got my introduction to Seduction Cinema a couple of weeks ago with the decent ' Sin Sisters ' , and while it was a long way both from being brilliant and from the hardcore pornography I'm used to ; it was just about good enough to warrant seeing another . Dr Jekyll and Mistress Hyde is very much along the same lines as Sin Sisters in terms of style and plotting , although as the title suggests ; the film takes it's backbone from the Robert Louis Stevenson classic novel ' Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde ' . The film puts lesbian sex at its forefront ( nothing wrong with that ) and probably took about two minutes to write . Stevenson's classic easily lends itself to a sex film , and here we focus on Dr Jackie Stevenson ( nice name . . . ) , a female scientist that has developed a drug to do . . . something . . . to women . After trying it on herself , she develops an alter-ego - except this time the alter ego doesn't turn to murder , it turns to having sex with the sultry Misty Mundae , whom Jackie meets at a bus stop . From there , we follow the bizarre love story to its unexpected final twist . The film looks like it was shot with a video camera and probably cost just a fistful of dollars to make . The performances are terrible , with the female leads looking great while delivering awful lines of dialogue in a horribly wooden way . This doesn't matter , of course , as the whole point of the film is simply for its male audience members to enjoy themselves , although it doesn't deliver too much on that front either . Like the performances , the sex is wooden and fake looking and while the initial seduction between Misty Mundae and Julian Wells is rather nice , the rest of the film just sort of rolls on . However , despite its many shortcomings - Dr Jekyll and Mistress Hyde is a real fun film to watch . It's all so stupid that you'd have to be completely humourless not to have a laugh at it , and watching the female leads go at each other is nice even though it's not very well done . Mundae and Wells bode extremely well together as they're polar opposites , and it's obvious that director Tony Marsiglia knows that . The ending feels incredibly tacked on ; but given all the lacklustre ways they could have ended it , the conclusion isn't too bad . Overall ; this film is OK with me .
422143	2248099	167350	6.0	Rosemary's ( extra-terrestrial ) Baby	Rosemary's Baby meets Alien , Brian Yuzna style ! Actually , this is a surprisingly restrained effort from the man behind such gory classics as Bride of Re-Animator and The Dentist , though we do still get some nasty styled gore . The film is rather well put together and the acting is not bad ; the only real criticism I have of the film is that it's not very ambitious . The whole film revolves around the central plot point and despite being at least interesting throughout , it doesn't really go anywhere once it reaches its conclusion , which is a bit of a shame . The plot focuses on husband and wife Craig and Sherry Burton . They've been trying for a baby but not had much luck ; although their luck changes one day when Sherry discovers that she has finally become pregnant . However , this happens shortly after a strange night where the couple , during sex , both had a blackout . As time moves on Craig increasingly begins to suspect that there's something wrong with the baby and begins to question what happened during the blackout . The film takes obvious influence from films such as Rosemary's Baby , although the plot is much shallower . There's plenty of ways that Brian Yuzna could have taken the story but it's never really developed beyond the immediate ideas . The immediate ideas are good however and the film features plenty of decent set pieces - most of which are reminiscent of what actual expecting couples would have to go through ( e . g . an ultrasound scan ) . The central cast is good with Arnold Vosloo and Jillian McWhirter convincing as the central couple and receiving good support from Brad Dourif as a doctor . The film is not particularly gory but we do get some inventive alien effects courtesy of Screaming Mad George . The aliens themselves are not seen all that often but we do at least get a general idea . The film might have been better had it been a bit more expansive and not focused solely on the pregnancy ; but even so the ending is decent enough ( if a little muddled ) and while this film is not great ; it is at least worth a look for horror fans .
421763	2248099	56565	6.0	Not enough plot to fill the running time	The Tell-Tale Heart is one of the best known of Edgar Allen Poe's works ; and I was surprised that I had not seen a film based on it . The original story is just a short story , and while there have been many versions of this tale committed to screen ; most of them are only shorts themselves ; thus making this film one of the few feature length editions of the story . Well . . . after having seen it , I have to admit that I'm not surprised there aren't more feature length versions because really there isn't enough plot to stretch to such a long running time . Thus , most of the story of this film has no relation to Poe's original story . We focus on a man named Edgar ( a bit of a ham-fisted reference if you ask me ) ; a quiet man that lacks experience with women . When he notices a young lady named Betty in a house across the street ; he resolves to romance her and asks his close friend Carl for advice on how to speak to women . He and Betty are getting on well ; until he discovers that Carl and Betty are also getting on well , and so Carl is murdered . The film is shot in black and white and looks really cheap throughout . Director Ernest Morris appears not to have the resolve to elevate the film above the mundane and also fails to get a good performance out of his any of his ( relatively ) unknown cast ; which renders the whole production rather bland . Of course , the whole film is just build up to the inevitable situation whereby the murderous central character is haunted by the echoes of the beating heart from the man he has killed , and this leaves most of it feeling rather pointless . To the film's credit , however , it does handle Poe's actual story well and things do become much more interesting once we reach the main part of the film . This version of The Tell-Tale Heart never really gets into the psychological side of Poe's original story ; and the reason for that really just goes back to the characters , which aren't interesting enough . Overall , this is really a lacklustre effort and I wouldn't recommend tracking it down ; this story is more suited to a short film anyway , and I'm sure that at least one of the many short film versions is superior to this effort .
422940	2248099	65206	6.0	Sorry , but I don't really care what happened to Aunt Alice . . .	I went into this film with fairly high expectations given all that I'd heard about it , but the simple fact is that What Ever Happened to Aunt Alice did little for me . Given the fact that the title is an obvious rip-off of Robert Altman's 1962 film What Ever Happened to Baby Jane , I was expecting this to be more of a comedy , but despite the fact that it's extremely camp ; there's not a great deal of ' fun ' to be had with it . There were a lot of horror films released during the sixties that featured a strong female lead , and while many of them ( Altman's film and Lady in a Cage spring to mind instantly ) were very good , this one is surprisingly lacking . The plot follows a woman who loses her fortune after the death of her husband . She decides to start taking in housekeepers and then dispatching them in order to steal their savings and rectify her financial situation , but after ridding herself of her latest housekeeper ; she doesn't realise that the new applicant , an Alice Dimmock , was a friend of the old housekeeper and has taken the job with the intention of investigating the mysterious disappearance . Director Lee H . Katzin doesn't do a very good job of creating atmosphere , and the film feels like it should be really be a comedy . The plot is very thin , and despite attempts to bulk it out with a number of sub-plots , the film still feels like it needs a little more impact than it has . The film relies on its female leads ; Geraldine Paige and Ruth Gordon , too much and despite the fact that both give nice performances , neither one has enough to completely carry the film . The decision to film it in colour was a bad one as well - it gives the film a really cheap feel and I don't doubt that it would have been a hell of a lot better in black and white ! The story flows quite slowly overall , and this is something of a nuisance as the attempts to build interest with plots involving a dog and a few other things don't provide enough of a distraction when the film starts to drag . It's all pretty tame until the part towards the end when the two leads finally have their battle . . . but even that is disappointing and while the twist at the end may please some , I was left rather unfulfilled . Overall , What Ever Happened to Aunt Alice was a huge disappointment for me and therefore I don't recommend it !
423311	2248099	70624	6.0	Interesting short film from the Hellraiser creator	Salome is one of two short films that horror writer Clive Barker directed before he went on to make the cult classic ' Hellraiser ' . While you cant go into a short film expecting the likes of Hellraiser , Clive Barker does deliver an interesting spectacle with this film and , like many director's pre-hit short films , you can see some early signs of the man's later work in this film . Salome only runs at about twenty minutes , and it has no dialogue ; so the plot is non-existent . This doesn't matter , however , as it is the imagery and atmosphere that is important ; and Clive Barker , even with only twenty minutes to play with , more than succeeds in impressing on that level . The action takes place in a dank abyss , and through the dark atmosphere and empty surroundings , Barker is able to show this . While this film doesn't have enough about it to aptly call it ' good ' , by the same standards ; it's not bad either . Fans of Hellraiser will enjoy the film for it's style , and fans of atmosphere will find lots to like also . Salome isn't worth going out of your way to see ; but if you come across a copy , it's well worth seeing .
422957	2248099	70229	6.0	One of the less notable made for TV seventies horror flicks	I've found , after seeing a dozen or so of them , that made for TV seventies horror flicks are generally good for seventy minutes of entertainment . This one looked really good considering the comments about it , so I hoped that I'd be in for one of the better ones ; however , that wasn't the case . It's not that this is a bad film , but it's not all that good either and certainly isn't one of the better made for TV movies from the seventies that I've seen . The plot is interesting enough , and focuses on a small town where a bunch of old people are dying . There are certain similarities between the deaths , and it leads Sheriff Dan Barnes ( Alan Alda ) to investigate . The plot plods along at a relaxing pace , and there's not a great deal of suspense or interest , which is a bit of a surprise since director John Badham would go on to make the very suspenseful thriller ' Nick of Time ' . . . though that was twenty two years later . The small town setting provides a good place for the film to take place , but this isn't taken advantage of to any notable extent , and the film simply boils down to a simple ending . Overall , this film isn't terrible ; but it's not great either , and I can't really recommend bothering to track it down .
423620	2248099	206154	6.0	Bizarre and atmospheric lesbian flick	It might have its problems , but at the very least , The Girl Slaves of Morgana Le Fay is memorable for the fact that it's so damn strange ! Director Bruno Gantillon succeeds in creating a surreal , dreamlike atmosphere ; which bodes very well with the fantasy styled plot . As the title suggests , the backbone of this film revolves around sex and since most of the characters are female , that should please fans of lesbian porn . The plot itself is typically strange and focuses on a castle ran by the mysterious and sinister Morgana le Fay . Two young ladies are travelling across the country when they get a surprise one morning . One of them awakes to find that the other has disappeared , and upon searching for her friend , she happens upon a boat . The boat takes her to an eerie castle where she meets Morgana le Fay and is taken in by the women in the castle . She is offered immortality in return for her soul , but as jealousies take hold she decides to make an attempt to escape , but getting away from Morgana le Fay is not so easy . . . One of the main problems I had with this film is the fact that not a great deal happens , so it's easy to get bored with it ; the dream-like atmosphere is actually a hindrance in this respect as when you're watching a dreamy , boring movie - it can sometimes be difficult to stay awake ! To its credit , The Girl Slaves of Morgana Le Fay is a very beautiful movie . There's no shortage of eye candy , all the women in the film look great and the lavish sets are well designed and suit the film . I can't say that it's a particularly graphic film , though that isn't a big problem . The lesbian sequences are well filmed and fairly erotic , which of benefit to the film . The film is a lot like the lesbian vampire flicks that cult French director Jean Rollin made around the same time that this film was made ; although personally I'd rank this one higher than the majority of Jean Rollin rubbish that I've seen . This is not a great film and it does have its fair share of problems , but it also has a lot of good things about it , and while I can't say it's a film that everyone should see ; it should please genre fans at least .
423095	2248099	303397	6.0	An interesting idea	This film , that received an incognito release back in 2001 , isn't actually as good as it's minor cult following would suggest . That's not to say that it isn't good , however ; it's refreshing to see something a little different and although the film is flawed , it does succeed for that reason . The story follows a reclusive man that lives in the woods and witnesses a murder while searching for his cat . The film doesn't have any dialogue , and is told in chapters . This makes the film different from the outset as it leaves the audience with only their own thoughts as to what's going and nothing is ever really explained . Other films , such as the worst film ever made ; The Blair Witch Project , have tried similar ways of developing a plot and most have failed . This one doesn't really succeed , but it's probably the best example I've seen yet . The film is almost completely set in the woods , and there aren't many people other than our central character shown on screen . This gives the film an intense feeling of loneliness and isolation , which is always unsettling . The film also seems to have taken some influence from true cult classic ' The Evil Dead ' in the way it is shot . The way that the camera moves through the woods is reminiscent of the ' Raimi-cam ' that was introduced in said movie . In spite of having no dialogue , and moving relatively slowly ; Soft for Digging never becomes boring and the scenes where we are allowed to brood with the main character are kept alive by what the audience thinks as we see him trying to continue with his life . The film features some very unnerving nightmare sequences , which are the movie's best moments and also come as something as a surprise in a movie of this nature . Nothing , however , can prepare you for the ending , which is as ambiguous as it is disgraceful and I almost guarantee that it will shock , repulse and surprise you . There's not really enough of this film , and what there is isn't really good enough to call it ' good ' without lying . However , this is an impressive first feature from director J . T . Petty and I look forward to seeing better things from him in the future .
422865	2248099	810823	6.0	Not bad . . . could have been better	I went into this film with some hope as the plot certainly sounded like it could be a springboard for a good , and largely original horror film . As it turns out , the film is somewhat original and it's fairly interesting ; but its not all that well handled and what we end up with could be described as a near miss . One of the most curious things about The Deaths of Ian Stone is the fact that it's directed by Dario Piana ; a name that will mean nothing to most people , but Giallo fans might remember his previous film ( released over twenty years ago ) ; the surprisingly good , Too Beautiful To Die . Anyway , the plot focuses on Ian Stone ; a regular guy . . . except for the fact that he keeps waking up in strange new lives after being violently killed . It's not long before Ian starts being able to piece together why this is happening to him ; although he is constantly being chased by a strange unseen force seeking to murder him at every turn . This film was released as one of After Dark's " Eight Films to Die For " and is often seen as one of the better films of that series . I wouldn't disagree with that . The film does get off to a good start and we are made to wonder exactly what is going on . The film doesn't make its audience wait long before beginning to reveal the reasons behind the title character's predicament , but unfortunately this is where the film begins to fall down as the explanation isn't as intriguing as I was hoping and the film soon starts to feel like it could be an episode of Doctor Who . There are plenty of plot holes and unanswered questions too , and that doesn't exactly help things . The film was clearly made on a low budget and unfortunately is heavy with CGI effects that look rather cheap . The acting is serviceable , and Mike Vogel leads a capable cast . Once we reach the final third , things start to become really messy and it becomes hard to care about what's happening . Despite its problems , however , The Deaths of Ian Stone is at least worth a look ; but I wouldn't recommend busting a gut trying to find a copy .
422910	2248099	83000	6.0	Decent enough road thriller	Many films - from classics such as Dual and The Hitcher , to lesser known gems like Hitch-Hike and modern thrillers such as Roadkill - have shown cinema audiences that the road can be a great setting for a movie , but while Roadgames certainly has it's moments ; it has to be said that isn't as good as some of those that have gone before and come after . Director Richard Franklin ( ' Psycho II ' ) does a good job of implementing the loneliness of the road on the audience by way of keeping the focus on the main character - a weary trucker , and ensuring that we are drawn into his plight . The lead role is taken by Stacy Keach , who fits into the role of Pat Quid nicely . Quid is driving a truck across Australia , along with his pet dingo . He picks up various hitch-hikers along the way , and at one point stops at a hotel ; where he witnesses a man take in a girl he saw on the road earlier . She soon disappears , and this coincides with reports on the radio of a serial killer stalking the same roads that Quid is driving . However , that isn't all Quid has to worry about ; as the police are beginning to suspect him of the crimes . . . My main problem with this film is that it takes too long to get going , and once it does finally get itself into gear ; the plot isn't overly interesting , and it all feels rather underdone . There are a number of small things that bring the overall rating of this film up ; things such as the fact that the main character has a pet dingo gives Roadgames some extra character . The lead performances are good enough , with the previously mentioned Stacy Keach carrying the entire film on his shoulders for most of the duration . Keach is an underrated actor , and it's always nice to see him in films - even underdeveloped ones like this . Jamie Lee Curtis is his co-star and is decent enough in her relatively small role , while no one else is given the screen time to impress . The score is a little bit too playful and annoying for my liking , but it's not enough to spoil the movie . Roadgames does have a number of good set pieces and the way that the director builds the mystery is good - it's just disappointing compared to other similar films . I would , however , say that if you enjoy films of this nature ; Roadgames is well worth a look .
423067	2248099	52820	6.0	Short and sweet , but underwhelming and unambitious	What we have here is a film that could have been a fascinating slice of classic B-movie cinema , but unfortunately relegates itself to the mundane thanks to some extremely uninspired handling . The film features the usually fascinating themes of voodoo and ancient curses , and it's given an extra dimension of intrigue thanks to the idea of shrunken heads , which provides the film with a lot of its more unpleasant moments . The film is hardly shocking nowadays , but back in 1960 , I don't doubt that the scenes featuring severed heads were distressing for the audience . These scenes are brilliantly offset by the fact that most of the film is very old-school , and wouldn't have been out of place with a release in the 1930's . The plot follows the Drake family ; who were lumbered with a curse after one of the ancestors decided to kill a bunch of Indians on the Amazon two hundred years ago . The film isn't on for long , lasting only 70 minutes , but that's actually a shame as while the film we do have is never entirely fascinating ; with a better script and a bit more ambition from all concerned ; The Four Skulls of Jonathon Drake could have been a great film . None of the actors are particularly worth mentioning ; but the ensemble performance does fit the movie in that nobody is willing to go that extra mile . Overall , I would say that this film is just about worth seeing ; but it's not a major priority , and there are certainly a lot of better horror flicks from the same period .
423177	2248099	130905	6.0	Too gory for Aussie TV	My knowledge of Australian horror cinema isn't exactly encyclopaedic , but apparently , this is the first Oz horror film . Night of Fear was originally intended to be the first episode in a twelve part Australian TV horror series , but because Australian censors deemed it ' too gory ' , it never saw the light of day ; until its DVD release some years later . The film definitely is nastier than your average TV show , and it's not really surprising that it never got shown on television . There is no dialogue at all in the film , although this is masked by a barrage of tense and macabre scenes that our young heroine terrorised by a madman . While the film does well in the violence and gore stakes , I personally don't rate it as a masterpiece simply because there isn't all that much to it . The film only lasts for fifty minutes , so you can't expect too much - but the unrelenting pace can become monotonous . You've got to respect writer-director Terry Bourke for attempting to bring horror to Australian TV screens and having his attempt dismissed for featuring too much horror , but personally I'd rather have seen him put his efforts into a more ambitious feature length film instead , and I'll endeavour to see his later efforts such as ' Inn of the Damned ' .
423738	2248099	79207	6.0	Grisly and sleazy - but not all that good	Anyone that knows anything about this film knows that it's grisly and sleazy - but to be honest , up until about the hour mark ; I feared that I may be in the wrong film . Don't get me wrong , I love a good slice of disgusting sleaze ; but not when the resulting film is boring . The first two thirds of the film focus mainly on sex and police procedure , with just a little blood thrown in for good measure . These sections of the film really drag , and don't give credence to the opening shot that sees a young man being repeatedly stabbed in the crotch . However , you've got to expect this sort of poor plot pacing from Eurotrash cinema , and to this film's credit - it gets a lot better as it goes on , as the death scenes get nastier and the plot gets more interesting . The first major plot point sees the police find the bodies of a young couple ; he has been stabbed to death , and she has drowned and then had her body taken out of the water . We then follow police inspector De Pol , as he questions several people , some of which turn up dead themselves . The two sides of the plot ; those being the murders and the resulting investigation , don't bode well at all - and Giallo a Venezia feels very disjointed as neither one compliments the other , meaning that the film isn't very thrilling overall . By keeping the focus on the unpleasantness and sleaze , however , director Mario Landi makes sure that it's always obvious exactly what the point of the film is . Indeed , even the usually beautiful Venetian canals look sordid in this film , and while that helps the look and feel of the film ; it doesn't do much for the aesthetics . Jeff Blynn is ineffective in the lead role , and looks like he accidentally stepped off the set of Starsky and Hutch . The violence is extremely misogynistic , and almost every woman in the film ends up being violated in some way . The scenes of gore are mostly good , and see such delights as a man being shot and set on fire and the butchery of a woman on a table , who promptly turns up inside a refrigerator ! The conclusion to the film is the best element , and Mario Landi somehow managed to make this messy sleaze flick make sense . Overall , I can't say that Giallo a Venezia is one of the best Giallo's I've seen ( not by a mile ) ; but it has its positives elements and may delight fans of morbid sleaze .
422190	2248099	67367	6.0	Left me with a lust to see a better Hammer film	Lust for a Vampire is one of Hammer's lesser known films , and that's hardly surprising as none of their A-list stars were involved in it . Even so , this film actually features one of the more interesting vampire plots that the studio had to offer , although it has to be said that it isn't executed as well as it could have been . The film starts off slowly , and despite a brief period of interest around halfway through ? Lust for a Vampire is never overly exciting , and too much focus is put on mildly sensuous tones of the vampires ' lusts . It's clear that Hammer were being heavily influenced by the trashy films coming out of Europe by the seventies , and that's a shame as sex was never Hammer's strongpoint . The plot is something of a mess , and focuses on the common vampire theme of someone being resurrected . In this case it's Mircalla , formerly known as Carmilla ; a beautiful vampire countess . The home of the vampires is conveniently located right next to a finishing school , which just happens to be populated by beautiful buxom bisexuals with huge breasts , and teachers with a fascination for vampirism . The IMDb trivia section sheds some light on this production - the great combination of Terence Fisher and Peter Cushing had to drop out , and Ralph Bates and Jimmy Sangster were brought in at short notice . While Sangster is a capable director , and Bates has provided some great supporting turns for Hammer ; neither is up to the standard of the pair that dropped out . Ralph Bates does the steal the show , however , with by far the most memorable performance of the film . Yutte Stensgaard takes the female lead , and impresses constantly with her body and angelic good looks . The locations used are generally of a high standard and provide a good Gothic atmosphere for the film to bathe in . . . but all this style isn't enough . There's a complete lack of tension and the plot isn't intriguing enough to draw the audience into the film . The finishing touch is the rubbish Mike Raven performance , which just made me wish for Christopher Lee . This is part of a trilogy of films from Hammer studios that revolve around the Karnstein's , and it's by far the weakest . Not a patch on the great Twins of Evil or the good Vampire Lovers ; Lust for a Vampire is just about worth watching , but I wouldn't make it a priority .
421983	2248099	71200	6.0	Enjoyable high camp werewolf mystery . . . .	Amicus are a studio most famous for putting out horror anthologies ; but they did a couple of feature length horror films , mostly with mixed results . The Beast Must Die could easily be described as a mixed result all by itself . On the one hand , it's based on a fun premise , which does a great job of getting the audience involved in the film ; yet it doesn't quite work . The werewolf sub-genre is full of failures , but this film can't quite be considered such because it's not really a werewolf film . The werewolf plot is only in the film to tie it to the horror genre , which Amicus had so much success with ; and the real point of the film is the mystery . In the style of the great William Castle film , ' The Tingler ' - The Beast Must Die talks to it's audience , and actively involves them in the search for the wolf . The plot follows a hunter who invites six guests to his country mansion on the basis that one of them is a werewolf . The full moon cycle lasts for three days , and our hero vows to find out which one is the werewolf , and kill that person , before the three days are up . . . The Beast Must Die profits from its cast . Headed by Peter Cushing ( who dons a very silly accent ) , The Beast Must Die benefits from a stellar English cast including Anton Diffring , Michael Gambon and Calvin Lockhart ( who's actually from the Bahamas ) in the lead role . The film is high camp throughout , and director Paul Annett does a good job of ensuring that The Beast Must Die never becomes too serious . The mystery itself takes the lead over the horror element , but that's not a problem because going into this film , you really should be expecting a mystery thriller , not essentially a horror flick . The film is a long way from being a perfect piece of camp , however , as it gets a little too boring at times ; and the fact that there isn't a lot of wolf will no doubt annoy certain viewers . The mystery isn't exactly brilliant either , but by the end - it really could have been anyone , making the ' guess the werewolf ' game fun ; but a bit pointless , as the rest of the film hasn't narrowed it down . I enjoyed this film a lot ; but wouldn't recommend going out of one's way to find it .
422514	2248099	75255	6.0	Nothing like as good as the first , but amusing enough .	I wouldn't hesitate to name Sergio Martino as one of my all time favourite directors . His Giallo is second only to the great Dario Argento , and he's made a few other nice films in other genres too . Sex comedies were popular in the seventies Italy , and like most Italian directors ; Martino was happy to turn his hand to the current popular genre . Prior to seeing this film , I had seen two Martino sex comedies , both starring Edwige Fenech and both very good ; the films being Giovannona Long-Thigh and the first Sex with a Smile . I wasn't too hopeful for this sequel given how Italian sequels usually go ; and while it's weaker than the other two sex comedies that I've seen from Martino ; it still offers a decent ninety minutes of entertainment . The stories in this film don't follow on at all from those in the first , and the best one here isn't as good as the worst one in the first film ; but as I say , it's enjoyable enough light-hearted stuff , and it would be foolish to go into a seventies Italian sex comedy with any higher expectations than that . The stories are something of a mixed bag . The first one is a silly and fairly amusing yarn revolving round private detectives trying to prove to a husband that his faithful wife is unfaithful . It's a decent opener . The middle two tales are better ; the first of which is an Italian variant on Some Like it Hot . It revolves around a man who decides to dress up as a woman so he can replace the star player on the ladies football team . Naturally , most of the tale revolves around the shower and our hero also attracts some unwanted attention from members of both sexes . The third tale is probably the best and stars the beautiful Barbara Bouchet . It revolves around an unfaithful husband trying to hide his mistress from his wife , and losing out to a would-be thief . The final story is somewhat boring , and has something to do with a woman trying to cheat on her husband right under his nose , and not being very successful at it . The film is fairly raunchy throughout , but not really very sleazy . There's a bit of nudity here and there , but nothing to write home about . The jokes are decent and the odd comical situation is funny , but this is more an amusing timewaster than a brilliant comedy .
423478	2248099	75291	6.0	Well made but disappointing Italian chiller	A Whisper in the Dark is a very well made Italian chiller ; a million miles away from the cheap quickies that the nation is more famous for making . However , despite being a technically well made film ; A Whisper in the Dark misses out where the story is concerned . It's all of a very slow build variety and unfortunately the film doesn't manage to elevate itself enough to go above ' faintly interesting ' and the result is rather disappointing . The base of this story has been seen many times since this film - though not all that many times before ; however , influence was clearly taken from Nicholas Roeg's masterpiece Don't Look Now . The plot focuses on a boy named Martino . Martino has an imaginary brother named Luca ; and this is a worry to his parent as the child they lost was to be called Luca before its premature death . Strange things start to happen and before long the parents begin to believe that maybe there's something more to the ' game ' that their son is playing and seek medical help for the boy . Most of the duration of the film is spent on build up and as such I was expecting something pretty special by the end . Be it a clever twist or maybe even a shock ; but unfortunately that never happens . The film just builds up to nothing at all and that is the major problem with it . It's a real shame too because this could have been great considering the obvious effort that went into it . A Whisper in the Dark is a very beautiful film ; the decor and cinematography is mouth watering and the direction courtesy of Marcello Aliprandi is excellent . Furthermore , the acting is not bad ; with child actor Alessandro Poggi doing well in the lead role and getting capable support from the likes of John Phillip Law , Nathalie Delon and Joseph Cotten in what is little more than a cameo role . The events during the film are always mildly interesting but the only reason the film kept my attention was because I was waiting for something to happen . The ending is an anti-climax to say the least and it spoils what otherwise could have been a very good film !
423760	2248099	63526	6.0	Lesser Chabrol effort	The more Claude Chabrol films I check out , the more I like the great French director . Prior to seeing this early Chabrol flick , I hadn't seen a bad film from him - after seeing it , I have to say that I still haven't ; but that doesn't change the fact that The Road to Corinth is a decidedly sub par offering from the usually solid director . Chabrol's best work tends to focus solely on characters - in particular the relationship between husband and wife - but this film focuses on more global events and the characters take a backseat . The plot focuses on a set of black boxes that have the ability to jam radar installations . Naturally there are people out to protect these devices and it's not long before an American agent is killed while trying to locate them . Despite the advice of a fellow American , his widow Shanny resolves to get on the same lead that her husband was following prior to his death , hunt down the black boxes and get revenge on the people that killed her husband . The film is rather strange as it lacks Chabrol's usual suspense and that is replaced by a sort of awkward comedy which serves only in offsetting what little tension there is since the comedy does not work . One of the major problems with this film is undoubtedly the plot line which doesn't exactly help the lack of suspense because it's really rather boring within itself and Chabrol doesn't give the audience much reason to care about the black boxes at the centre of the story . The film does have some saving graces on the style front , however , as lead actress Jean Seberg is very easy on the eyes and Chabrol's cinematography captures the locations used well . The first half of the film just sort of drones along with barely any excitement at all , but to the film's credit ; things do pick up a little bit in the second half of the film as the story draws to a close . In spite of this , however , The Road to Corinth does feel more than a little bit pointless and it's clear that Chabrol didn't really have anything to say with it . Overall , this is not one of the great director's better efforts and I would not recommend it !
423875	2248099	79788	6.0	Gory Italian Zombi flick !	Zombi 2 saw Lucio Fulci deliver a film that took huge influence from George Romero's zombie masterpiece Dawn of the Dead ( even though the great horror director claims to have been influenced by Jacques Tourneur ) , and Zombi Holocaust in turn takes influence from Fulci's Zombi 2 . Zombi Holocaust is more than just a simple rip-off , however , as prolific director Marino Girolami finds time to implement other horror themes such as cannibal tribes and mad scientists into the plot . The film takes place in the same location as Fulci's zombie flick , and sees the undead eating people on a Caribbean island . This film very much fits into the Italian zombie sub-genre , with such treats as bad acting , worse dubbing , a rather absurd plot line and plenty of blood and guts making it into the finished product . The plot sees a mad scientist on a tropical island experimenting with life and death and ending up turning a number of the locals into zombies . We follow an expeditionary group who land on the island as they come face to face with the zombies and cannibals that live there . If you're a fan of blood and guts , you're in the right movie . The gore is mostly comical , but it works due to the fact that it's so massively over the top . Scenes that see a zombie have its face mashed by a propeller , numerous slit throats and several sequences that see the living being eaten offer a gory treat for the horror fan . The fact that this is so much like Zombi 2 put me off a little , however , as it really does feel like you're watching a follow up rather than a supposedly original zombie film . Saying that , this film would have made a far better follow up than Fulci's own Zombi sequel . The atmosphere is well done , as the setting gives the piece an element of mystery that comes part and parcel with a lot of the Italian cannibal films . The zombie make-up is suitably disgusting and a lot of the monsters really do look like they haven't been among the living for some time . Interestingly , the central roles are taken up by Fulci collaborators Ian McCulloch ( Zombi 2 ) and Alexandra Delli Colli ( The New York Ripper ) , which seems quite fitting . Overall , I can't say that this is one of my favourite zombie films ; but its decent enough entertainment , and there's definitely something here for zombie fans .
423463	2248099	105112	7.0	Tight and entertaining little thriller	Well , I have to say that I don't have much interest in Tom Clancy , as the only film I'd seen based on his work prior to seeing this one was the 2002 film ' The Sum of All Fears ' , and all I can remember about it was that I found it really boring . Patriot Games is , apparently , the follow up to the 1990 film ' The Hunt For Red October ' - I haven't seen it , but to me this film stands up pretty well on it's own so I don't think that is a problem . Patriot Games is a pretty tight little thriller which holds up well despite some questionable plot points and some rather unbelievable goings on . The plot focuses on Clancy protagonist Jack Ryan , a former CIA man holidaying in Britain . He happens to be around when some IRA terrorists make an assassination attempt on some member of the royal family , and thwarts the attack by killing one terrorist and letting the other be apprehended by the police . The remaining man is Sean Miller , and he's not too happy about the death of the other terrorist as it happens to have been his brother . A personal vendetta is then sworn as the terrorist seeks revenge . The film benefits from a decent cast . Harrison Ford isn't the best actor of all time , and here he pretty much sleepwalks through the film ( as usual ) , but somehow he has great screen presence , and since this thriller doesn't exactly demand high quality acting ; he fits the role just fine . Sean Bean is his opposite number . Bean is an actor I've never really liked , but he does play villains well , and he manages to make the audience believe that he is hell-bent on revenge . The rest of the film is made up with good support turns from the likes of Samuel l . Jackson , Thora Birch , Anne Archer and James Earl Jones . Apparently , the film puts an untrue spin on terrorist groups ; but my advice with regards to that is just ignore it and enjoy the action . There's a fair amount of action too , as the film features car chases , shootouts and various fistfights . It does take a while for Patriot Games to get going ; about an hour in fact , but it's not boring at any point , and therefore makes for good entertainment throughout . Overall , Patriot Games is not ' brilliant ' by any means ; but it's a fun ride and my advice is ; just relax and enjoy it !
423241	2248099	112818	7.0	Good performances in a mostly successful drama	I don't usually bother with Oscar winning films like this as they tend to annoy rather than impress ; but I've got to give plaudits to Tim Robbins ' heartfelt drama , as the characters are strong and the film does a great job of separating the sin from the sinner , while putting it's audience in the precarious position of deciding which one they hate most . The film plays off its central characters throughout , so it's lucky that The Shawshank Redemption star was able to get two talented performers in Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon to flesh out the script . I've got to admit that I'm not a fan of either of these stars , but I always appreciate good acting , and both have come a long way . Sean Penn got his first big role as a stoner in Fast Times at Ridgemount High , while Sarandon was once famous for performing in the likes of The Rocky Horror Picture Show . Both actors ' gives performances over and above what you would expect from them given their early film roles , and under the direction of a man that is no stranger to dramatic roles ; the film really works . The plot follows a nun who receives a letter from a man on death row who wants to avoid his capital punishment . After meeting the man , she begins to show empathy for his plight ; but he is not the only one with a stake in his death , as after meeting the families of his victims ; she begins to feel for them also , and ultimately finds herself in the position of feeling both for the murderer and his victims . The film does a good job of fully researching its topic ; as it's easy to think that a murderer on death row deserves to be killed , but after meeting his family and learning the nature of his crime ; Robbins ensures that the death of his central protagonist is not a happy event . You've got to expect a fair amount of sentiment in a film like this ; and Dead Man Walking certainly has it , although it never completely wallows in these elements , and the film climaxes as it should . The relaxed country atmosphere bodes well with the feel of the film , and both the performers manage to fit into their roles . Overall , Dead Man Walking certainly isn't a favourite of mine ; but as these films go , this is a rather good one .
423642	2248099	439815	7.0	Lovely little tribute to old-school horror !	Even though Slither isn't completely successful in achieving everything it set out to , it's an enjoyable ride and certainly one of the better horror films of the last couple of years . Prior to seeing the film , I'd heard it was a rip-off of the eighties cult classic ' Night of the Creeps ' , and while I can certainly see why people would say that - the film features ideas from a range of Sci-Fi and horror films , and overall I would say it's better to simply enjoy writer-director James Gunn's imagination and inventiveness rather than worry about who thought of the various plot points and themes first . The film begins with a meteorite falling to Earth . Around the same time , the amusingly named Grant Grant is trying to get it on with his wife , but she refuses his advances and he goes for a walk . . . to the local pub . After hooking up with some chick he used to know , the pair go walking through the same field that the meteor landed in , and pretty soon Mr Grant has found himself with the alien life form inside him . It's not long before the entire town is feeling Grant's misfortune , when they all become zombies and various mutants ! The film features an excellent turn from the brilliant Michael Rooker ; a severely underused actor and one of my favourites . While he unfortunately doesn't get a great deal of screen time ; he's well used and a great choice to play the alien's unfortunate victim . The central cast are all pretty good , with Elizabeth Banks doing well in her role and providing nice candy alongside Tania Saulnier , and Nathan Fillion , who was the best thing about last year's Serenity . The special effects are something of a mixed bag , and mostly consisting of CGI . At times , it looks good ; but sometimes it looks cheap , the special effects on the worms being the main offender in this department . James Gunn does a good job at directing , and he might be someone to keep an eye on as he does well at creating terror and there are several sequences in the film that are really well executed . The film starts off slowly , and builds into something of a horror romp with a number of ideas coming off well . It does feel a little bit flat , however , and Slither could have been a masterpiece if it had a bit more bite . Still , I'm not complaining as this film is always good fun to watch .
422691	2248099	73772	7.0	Interesting and well made TV movie	Sweet Hostage is another excellent example of a seventies made for TV movie . There were a lot of great TV movies made during what is probably the richest decade for great movies , although this one stands out a little from many as it is both feature length and feels every bit like a ' proper ' movie , not a made for TV one . The plot focuses on the idea of ' Stockholm Syndrome ' and we follow a young girl who is kidnapped by an escaped mental patient but ends up falling in love with him along the way . The film doesn't really appear to have any real point to make , but the way that everything plays out is always interesting and that is mostly thanks to the two lead performances which are excellent throughout . Martin Sheen gives a lively performance as the escaped mental patient and actually manages to make his character realistic in spite of the over the top script . Linda Blair is also very good as the kidnapped young girl and has a good chemistry with Sheen . The film is a little under ambitious and that's a shame as it does feel like more could have been made out of this plot ; but what we do end up with is an undoubtedly successful drama and I enjoyed this movie on the whole .
422884	2248099	65233	7.0	Surreal and bleak	As other reviewers have mentioned , it's difficult to know what to make of this film - and I suffered from the same problem ! Go Go Second Time Virgin is as surreal and strange as its title suggests it is . The basis behind the plot is relatively simple , but I have no idea what the film is trying to say and that's what enforces the weirdness of the film . Go Go Second Tim Virgin starts with a rape sequence and from there we focus on two teenagers ; one of which being the girl that was raped . The pair of them are depressed , and the girl insists that she wants to die and asks the boy to do it , but he refuses , preferring a different solution to the problem . The film is stylishly shot ; most of it is in black and white although certain sequences are portrayed in colour . The bleak atmosphere is the main point of the film ; this film is extremely bleak throughout and not a great deal of fun , which might not please anyone going into this film expecting something more fun , considering the film's ' pinku ' origins . There's not a great deal of sleaze in the film - the rape scenes are not overly graphic and there's not a great deal of gore either . I won't name this film as a favourite or anything like that , but it's an interesting little flick that is definitely worth seeing , and therefore comes recommended .
423178	2248099	87759	7.0	Flashdancing Death	Lucio Fulci's Murder Rock is often lambasted by both Fulci and Giallo fans ; and although I can certainly see why , I've got to say that this film satisfied me personally and I won't hesitate to label it a successful attempt at blending the tacky eighties styling's of dance phenomenon's the likes of ' Flashdance ' with the familiar styling's of the popular Italian Giallo . I'm sure Fulci thought he was on to a definite winner back in 1984 with all these popular elements in one film ; and even though I'm not sure how they would have been received at the time , nowadays it stands up as an amusing slice of kitsch nostalgia . I think the director cared more about making a quick buck on this film than providing the mass with a piece of art , and this shines through in the convoluted , but not well put together plot line . As you might expect , the film centres on a dance academy . After one of the girls is found dead , the cops place everyone at the academy under suspicion and when the murders continue ; the police are given more leads to eventually track down the perpetrator . The main reason why this film isn't liked by many of my fellow Fulci fanatics is due to the fact that it's relatively bloodless in comparison to his other works . The likes of The New York Ripper and The Beyond show the director at his gritty , blood-dripping best . . . whereas the kill scenes in this movie hardly feature any of the red stuff . That being said , they are still rather sadistic , as the killer knocks his victim out with chloroform before puncturing their heart with , of all things , a hat pin . Still , it has nothing on the eyeball violence of Zombie Flesh-Eaters . The musical numbers are atrocious in true eighties pop style , while the dance scenes are rather boring and not what I tuned in for . Fulci does find time to implement some gorgeous visuals , and the blue tint that accompanies most scenes gives the film a certain sense of art . Even though many of the film's elements are not brilliant , I still rate this film as an overall success as it's entertaining and fun to watch , and even though there are too many filler scenes ; the plot plays out nicely . It's not a major highlight either for the genre or for the director , but Murder Rock is still worth seeing .
423565	2248099	74085	7.0	Excellent telling of a true story	Steven Spielberg made a version of this true story in 2005 in an attempt to win the Best Picture award ; yet in spite of his big budget and top quality actors , he couldn't top this little TV movie from 1976 ! 21 Hours at Munich may not be a great film , but it's an interesting and successful telling of the events of the 1972 Olympic Games , and despite the fact that it is lacking in a few areas ; it does at least get its point across . I have to admit that I'm not too familiar with this story outside of the film versions , so I'm not sure exactly how accurate this retelling of it is . The film focuses on a terrorist plot by a group of Arabs ( from the Black September organisation ) to free some of their countrymen from prison . They kidnap eleven Israeli athletes and refuse to let them go until their demands are met . They are not interested in money ; they just want their countrymen freed from jail . This leads the authorities to work hard to strike a deal with the terrorists in order to get the hostages out alive . It has to be said that the film is not exactly heavy on the action front and much of the plot is taken up by talking , but this is OK because the script is interesting enough for the film not to grind to a halt because of it . The fact that this is a TV movie probably doesn't help as it has obvious restrictions on the budget and exactly what can be shown . The acting is well above par for a TV movie too , and the film features an excellent performance from the great Franco Nero who stars as the head of the terrorist organisation . He gets the performance spot on and hits all the right notes as a terrorist with an obvious human streak . William Holden is his co-star and also gives a first rate performance also . The plot flows well throughout and the film keeps up a steady pace with enough things going on to keep the proceedings interesting . Anyone who knows how this story went down will know what to expect from the ending ; but it's a good conclusion and overall , this is a very good movie ; much more involving than Spielberg's version of it , and I highly recommend checking it out if you get the chance .
423410	2248099	160339	7.0	Very nice little Grindhouse-style movie	I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by this little flick . Naturally I went in expecting it to be along the same lines as the classic ' girl power ' flick , I Spit on Your Grave ( ? . ) , and while the two share some common themes ; this film is certainly different enough for it not to be considered a rip-off . Recently , Quentin Tarantino tried to recreate the seventies Grindhouse style with ' Death Proof ' , but director Todd Morris actually succeeded in doing that over ten years ago with this film , as if it wasn't for the fact that I know that A Gun for Jennifer was made in 1996 , I definitely would have thought I was watching a seventies movie . The plot focuses on a group of man-hating ( probable ) lesbians who are tired of the way that men treat women and so decide to take the law into their own hands . The story really starts when they save a young woman from being mugged on the streets . They have her shoot the mugger and then allow her to join the gang . From there we follow the girls as they squabble amongst themselves and take down various male criminals in the city . . . In true seventies Grindhouse style , the film has a very low quality feel about . The picture is misty and the performances are all clearly delivered by inexperienced actors . However , this really adds to the film's overall quality - it's never overly clear whether or not the film is actually meant to feel like a seventies trash flick , but it does and that's what I really liked about it . The film also does a very good job of painting men in a very unfavourable light , and this benefits it because it makes the girls ' little tirade of retribution feel more worthwhile . The plot itself is fairly standard - for the first hour we basically just skip from one victim to another until eventually we find out who the real bad guy is and watch the girls go after him . The plot is thickened with some police involvement , though this isn't really capitalised upon . However , while the film could have been better ; I really do think that Todd Morris has done a good job with this film . It's not a brilliant masterpiece , but it's not bad at all and exploitation fans will probably get a kick out of it .
422219	2248099	65481	7.0	Entertaining enough , but lacking .	Bonnie and Clyde was a big hit in 1967 , and I don't doubt that Hollywood's great money-spinner , Roger Corman , had that on his mind when he decided to direct a film based on another of America's great crime legends . The story of " Machine Gun Totting Ma Barker " is a well known one ; I won't profess to know the ins and outs of it , but the basics are common knowledge . The film would only appear to be loosely based on the classic story , however , and Corman seemed keener to put the focus on the situation within the group rather than actually telling a story . The plot focuses on Ma Barker ; a strong matriarch with four sons . The story takes place within depression era USA and Ma and her sons find themselves with little to live on and so turn to crime . The troupe carries out robberies , commits murder and does other such illegal acts and it soon gets dubbed as a ' crime spree ' . However , more interesting than that is how the group itself works ; perversion is rife as we get to witness things such as incest and homosexuality within the group . The film is rather entertaining throughout , but for me ; something about it just doesn't work . Corman's directing style is very cold and despite excellent performances from the cast - the film fails to be involving and nobody really steps up to take the ' antihero ' role effectively . It's a good job , therefore , that the film is entertaining for most of the duration as there isn't much in the way of distraction when it comes to the less entertaining parts . Corman has got himself together a good cast of actors ; chief among them obviously being Shelly Winters . Winters looks decidedly less glamorous than in previous performances - but fits into her role here very well indeed and really convincing that she is the character she is portraying . The rest of the cast is fine too , featuring good performances from the likes of Don Stroud and Bruce Dern , as well an early performance from the great Robert DeNiro . There's not a great deal of highlights in the film ; but Pat Hingle's role is entertaining and it all boils down to a very well working final shootout scene . Overall , this is decent enough ; but I'm not surprised that it hasn't gone down as a great film and would only recommend it to those who happen across a copy .
422461	2248099	69920	7.0	Not brilliant , but worthwhile textbook example of the Giallo	If you want to see an absolute prime example of the Italian thriller , known as Giallo , you really need to go for one of Argento's offerings , preferably Bird With the Crystal Plumage or Deep Red , or perhaps Fulci's Don't Torture a Duckling . Hell , there's even Mario Bava's Blood and Black Lace or the fabulous House With the Windows that Laugh or What Have They Done to Solange ; TORSO , however , isn't an entry on the illustrious list of prime examples of the Giallo , but that doesn't mean it's a bad film . TORSO is a rather formulaic example of the style of film-making , and one that includes the majority of the staples that have gone on to epitomise the type of film . Things such as the black-gloved killer , brutal murders , lots of nudity and even bad dubbing all feature heavily . Like most Giallo's , this one features an insane killer and also sports the over the top plot that many have . It's rather textbook , actually , and aside from the killer we've got a dame in distress and an investigation going on . Oh , and there's a Victorian doll thrown in for good measure . TORSO is a semi-well respected entry in the Giallo cycle , and it's easy to see why . As mentioned , it isn't one of the prime examples but the fact that it features many of the clichés is bound to go down well with Giallo fans , not to mention the fact that the movie features high amounts of tension and is constantly thrilling for that reason , which doesn't hinder it's high rating either . The film features several sequences that stick out , and the last fifteen minutes or so are very thrilling indeed . The ending is definitely over the top , and somewhat silly , but Giallo fans have come to expect that over the years and it gives the film a certain kitschy edge . The acting is hard to rate because of the terrible dubbing , but even without the dubbing it isn't anything to write home about . Suzy Kendall does well in leading the movie , and makes a nice damsel in distress ; but the rest of the cast are largely unknown and forgettable . On the whole , I recommend this film to people that love Giallo , have seen most of the higher rated ones and need something else to watch .
423804	2248099	382205	7.0	The best non-Argento Giallo in over two decades !	Eyes of Crystal is certainly a very welcome film . Good Giallo's are few and far between these days , and this is easily the best that I've seen since 2001's Sleepless , which in turn is the best since Argento made the fantastic ' Opera ' back in 1987 . The film isn't a lot like the Giallo's of the seventies ( the golden period of the style ) , as the picture is largely glossy and clear and overall , the film is more character orientated than the murder fuelled classic Giallo structure ; in fact , I'd say that this film is more like the hit thriller Seven than any film by Dario Argento or Sergio Martino . The plot has two main areas ; firstly , it's a film about a police investigation into a series of murders , and secondly it's the story of the investigating officer wrestling with his conscience as he tries to solve the crimes . The plot starts off properly as a brutal triple murder is committed , and from there we follow the investigation into the murder , and see how the police pick up small clues to try and track the killer . Director Eros Puglielli injects his film with a slick sense of style as he directs the action through a number of different angles . The film features many scenes that really are beautiful ; the favourite of mine being the sequence that sees the police enter a murder scene in the dark with torches . The music is less frantic than that seen in previous Giallo films , and tends to be of a more searing nature , which helps to elevate the film over and above the story of murder and policemen that it is . I have to say that the music does go over the top at times , but generally it fits the scene . The main problem with this film , however , stems from the plot . The murders are grisly and gruesome , but it becomes too obvious where it's all going too quickly , and the reason behind the killings is hardly original , and since it's also rather silly ; it almost undoes all the hard work that has gone into the film up until the final twist is revealed . Giallo's have never been known for completely making sense and staying away from silly story lines - but Eyes of Crystal tries to go over and above the common tradition , and doesn't completely succeed . Even so , this is a quality thriller with good acting and fine direction which , when combined with the fact that this is the best Giallo in ages , means that Eyes of Crystal is well worth seeing .
423382	2248099	67119	7.0	A stranger called in Britain first !	The origins of the slasher flick can be traced all the way back to Hitchcock's masterpiece , Psycho , but the modern slasher is a different animal entirely . Some still believe that John Carpenter's overrated Halloween began the craze , but that was predated by Black Christmas , and that in turn was predated by this British flick from 1971 . Fair enough , this isn't exactly a template for the modern slasher film , but many of the staples of the genre - a young woman in peril , a killer fresh out of the loony bin , the babysitter theme etc - feature , and to the best of my knowledge ; this was one of the first films to feature these themes together . The film can be described as the film that ' When a Stranger Calls ' should have been , as it takes the theme of a babysitter being stalked by a lunatic , except everything is fit into one night ; and so doesn't suffer from the sprawling middle section of the aforementioned film . Amanda is a young babysitter who arrives at the residence of the Lloyds to look after their three year old son while they go out to a party . What she doesn't realise is that the father's biological father has broken out of a mental home , and has decided to go and see his won . . . By keeping the focus on just one situation over one period of time , director Peter Collinson ( Straight on Till Morning , The Italian Job ) creates a tense atmosphere , which benefits from the dark and gloomy feeling that the night setting gives to the story . The film isn't all that gory , but this doesn't really matter as the focus is always on the atmosphere , and this is enough to pull it through . The film benefits from two great performances . First and most importantly , we have Susan George , who lights up the screen throughout with her stunning good looks . Also appearing is Pussy Galore herself Honor Blackman , who is good in the time that she appears . The plot moves well throughout , and the fact that the film doesn't really have a great deal of story is excellently masked by the tense atmosphere , which is enough to keep things moving . There's only one real twist in the story , and that concerns the meeting of the lunatic father . His appearance isn't all that shocking since the hints that he will turn up come thick and fast early on . This is where Fright falls down , but even so ; this is a nice little exercise in suspense , and is well worth seeing .
422425	2248099	48696	7.0	When will silly scientists learn not to test new formulas on insects ! ?	Well , I'm not the biggest fan of fifties big bug movies ; but ' Them ! ' is something of a favourite of mine , and Tarantula isn't too far away from the quality of that classic film . The main thing I don't like about this sort of film is the fact that a lot of them are essentially the same - i . e . an insect grows to incredible size and terrorises everyone . Naturally , Tarantula follows that same sort of formula ; but this one has more about it , and it's also great fun to watch . There's a thin plot surrounding the huge tarantula , and that has something to with a new synthetic formula that can nourish life forms without the need for food . The scientists doing the experiments have tested this new formula on a tarantula , and after a fight at the lab - the giant bug escapes to wreak havoc across the Arizona desert ! The film is very ' American ' , and most of the central characters are the upstanding citizens that you would expect to find in fifties USA . The special effects are what really stand out about this film ; these days , a film like this would features a load of trashy CGI , but here they've ( obviously ) used a normal tarantula together with miniature sets , and while the effects aren't too realistic ; they work well and give the film a certain amount of charm , which is lacking in many modern films . It's not hard to see where the plot is going , but that's not a big problem as its fun getting to the end , and sub-plots involving a rare disease and several disfigured scientists add to the intrigue nicely . Overall , this film hasn't made me a fan of fifties big bug movies - but it's a very good example of one , and comes highly recommended !
422768	2248099	105699	7.0	Formulaic , but fun enough and worthwhile viewing	Unlawful Entry is by no means a great film ; not even by genre standards , but it still stands out as a more than adequate example of the genre , and aptly portrays the basic thriller tradition . Next to thrillers from the same period ; films like Basic Instinct , Unlawful Entry may seem a little tame , but as it puts the focus on its trio of central characters , the film becomes more interesting than it would have if experienced director Jonathan Kaplan had tried for more action and sex scenes . The film portrays the frightening idea of someone ' above the law ' abusing their power for their own means , and does this through police officer Pete Davis . The action centres on married couple Michael and Karen Carr , who call the police one night after a thief breaks in and holds the wife to knife point . However , it turns out that they've actually made things worse for themselves as the officer sent to the house takes a liking to Karen , and thus makes it his business to infiltrate their relationship and try to take Michael's wife for himself . . . It has to be said that the film doesn't offer much in the way of surprises , as the plot is purely formulaic and can be likened to any number of similar films , but somehow the familiarity of the plot gives it something of a relaxed feel , and while experienced movie watchers will feel that they've seen it all before , the film is carried off with enough panache to see it through . Unlawful Entry relies a lot on its actors , and the three at the centre of the story manage to deliver worthwhile performances . Kurt Russell gets toned down in his role as the unlucky husband , while Madeleine Stowe doesn't get to do any heavyweight acting , but at least looks nice . The pair doesn't really have any chemistry together , which is a shame and brings the piece down - but this is offset by a conniving Ray Liotta , who manages to get under the skin despite looking a bit like David Hasselhoff . The film is always interested , but never really intriguing ; although the plot does work well and the ending is fitting in context . Overall , this is not great or a must see film ; but its decent enough and I don't regret watching it .
422276	2248099	430676	7.0	Not a return to form for the Italian Hitchcock , but a good tribute to the master	Being a massive fan of Dario Argento , the release of a new Argento film is always an event as far as I'm concerned , and even though this made for TV movie is far from the director's best work ; it's a well orchestrated Giallo-style tribute to the great Alfred Hitchcock , and is well worth seeing for both fans of Argento and fans of Hitchcock . The film takes inspiration from across Hitchcock's filmography , and includes heavy handed ' tributes ' to the likes of Rear Window , Dial ' M ' for Murder and Strangers on a Train , as well as smaller nods to the likes of Psycho . The script is good in that it manages to take in all of these elements , and yet still turn out a mostly fresh-feeling story . The plot centres on Giulio - a film student and a big fan of Hitchcock . He lives opposite a sexy young woman and her mother , whom he constantly witnesses arguing with one another . When the mother is murdered , he becomes obsessed with figuring out who did it - especially since he heard his neighbour and another young woman discussing Strangers on a Train in the local video shop . Does Hitchcock's influence extend to this murder ? The first thing I noticed about this film was the rather awkward dialogue , which seems to taint many films of this kind . This shame aside , the thriller aspects of the movie work really well and Argento has lost none of his ability to create suspense . The film gets better as it goes along , and Argento adds in several well worked sequences that really have the ability to get the audience on the edge of their seats . Scenes involving a bathtub , a motorcycle and a Rear Window style climax make up the best of the suspense moments . There isn't as much gore in this film as there has been in previous Argento instalments - a shame , but the TV origins of the film would obviously have restrained the director , and there is a rather bloody murder sequence towards the start . I have to admit that I didn't like the main character very much , and the acting isn't all that good all round ; with only the female talent making any kind of impression ; and that's not because of their acting . Overall , this is hardly a return to form for Argento , but it's a lot better than The Card Player and is still a film well worth seeing .
423872	2248099	114194	7.0	Religion gets a comic book makeover !	Religion based horror movies have long been one of cinema's staples , and while that sub-genre is massively overpopulated ; The Prophecy represents a more than decent entry in the cycle . The film reunites Pulp Fiction cast members Christopher Walken , Amanda Plummer and Eric Stoltz , and that's quite apt as this film is like a pulp fiction bible story . I dread to think what god fearing folk make of this movie , as we have popular bible figures such as Gabriel and Lucifer spitting out crass one liners and getting involved in punch-ups . Things like this make the film hard to take seriously , but it's also deliriously entertaining and the plot offers more than enough thought-provoking elements to keep the film ticking over nicely . The story follows a war in heaven , which was kicked off by the way that God decided to give souls to humans and not angels . The soul of an evil war general is the Holy Grail , and the Angel Gabriel has come to Earth in order to claim it . However , fellow angel Simon has had other ideas and has taken it upon himself to hide the soul from Gabriel . The cast is the film's main strongpoint . I'm not a big fan of films like this , but I had to see this one simply because it has Christopher Walken playing Gabriel . Walken plays the character a lot like he would a mob boss and it really works rather well as he ensures that every moment he is on screen is a treat , and of course , his screen presence is immense . The talented Virginia Madsen takes a lead role and finds herself paired up with the weak link of the cast , Elias Koteas who is flat and hard to like in his starring role . A pre-fame Viggo Mortensen delivers a memorable performance in the coveted role of the Devil and the central cast is rounded off by the charismatic Eric Stoltz . The story moves well , and it's real strongpoint is the way that it gives you enough to think about during the less exciting scenes by way of it's many plot points . The situation is brought to the screen well , and Gregory Widen's screenplay is good enough to ensure that every character is given enough screen time for us to get to know who they are . The special effects are fine and the film is well directed by Widen in his only feature film director's role . This film is , perhaps , not for everyone ; but its good enough entertainment and I enjoyed it .
422283	2248099	179901	8.0	Maurizio Merli delivers again in an action packed Polizi flick !	Maurizio Merli may have come to fame as a Franco Nero impersonator ; but after that he really came into his own and if his name is on the cast list ( particularly if it's at the top of the cast list ) , you're pretty much guaranteed a good film . This one was the final outing for Merli's Commissario Betti character , and he ensures the ace crime fighter goes out with a bang as Marino Girolami's film is packed to breaking point with car chases , shootouts and fist fights and certainly delivers on the promise of being an action packed thriller ! The plot focuses on Commissario Betti . Once again , he's aggravated at the amount of crime going on in the city and his attention is focused mainly on two big crimes ; a bank robbery and a kidnap plot . The Commissioner battles bravely to ensure the crooks are brought to justice but soon realises that there's no point in merely sorting out the henchmen and decides to go after the man he believes is heading the criminal operations ; slimy businessman Albertelli , although bringing justice on the head criminal may not be so easy . . . This film is very easy to watch and getting lost in the numerous action scenes is a lot of fun . The plot flows very smoothly and there really is very little time when something isn't happening , which is really exactly what you want from a film like this . The action scenes do take over the plot at times ; but it's not really important because entertainment is the main thing . The plot itself is certainly interesting , however ; with the main focus being on the police matching wits with a very sly and intelligent criminal . You can always count on Maurizio Merli for a great performance and he doesn't disappoint here . He does look just a little bit silly at times admittedly , but he actually does convince us that he is a man who would give everything to stop crime in the city ( although by this point , he had a lot of practise ! ) . The film is not exactly heavy and although certain scenes are quite nasty ; the atmosphere is usually quite light . Franco Micalizzi's score is very good too , and Merli receives very good support from cult supremo John Saxon . The ending is a bit of downer , but I can't complain given how entertaining the rest of the film is . Highly recommended !
421991	2248099	73750	8.0	Superior adult film-making	Gerard Damiano directed two hardcore porn classics before directing this film - those being the influential Deep Throat and The Devil in Miss Jones , but for my money ; The Story of Joanna blows them both out of the water and is the best and most erotic of the three . The film apparently takes influence from the classic French tale of sadomasochism ' The Story of O ' and focuses on a strange relationship between two people . There isn't really a story to speak of as it's more just a premise from which the director springs all the sadomasochism and sex scenes . Basically , what we have is a rich aristocrat named Jason and his maid ? a submissive woman named Joanna . Their relationship begins in the aftermath of a meal in which Joanna proclaims that everybody needs to be loved , and Jason responds by bending her over a table and having his way with her . Jason then informs Joanna that despite her love for him , he will never love her back but still exposes her to all sorts of cruelty including bondage and sex with other lovers . The film has a classical setting and it's almost like the director was spoofing the classic romance pictures as the mood , music and performances all adhere to a higher level than what is usually expected from a porn film . This is one of my favourite things about The Story of Joanna ; it does feel very high quality and it bodes really well with the sadomasochistic sex scenes . Both the leads approach the film well and put in good performances . Terri Hall is absolutely beautiful and fits into the title role well and convinces as the submissive side of the central relationship . In contrast , Jamie Gillis is mysterious and brooding as the dominant partner which bodes well later on when the twist in the tale is revealed . The sex scenes are of course what most people will see the film for and the director clearly knows how to film something erotically as the sex in this movie is very good . It's also not overused and actually feels like the director is holding back on it at times ; which is actually refreshing as porn with wall to wall sex can be a bit dull . Overall , this is a fantastic porn film and comes highly recommend ; I'd rate it the second best S & M themed porn after the masterpiece The Punishment of Anne .
422941	2248099	35160	8.0	The postman rings twice in Italy , too !	Well , I'd heard from somewhere that Ossessione is a precursor to the Italian film genre , and particular favourite of mine , the ' Giallo ' . . . but actually , aside from the fact that this is a thriller that was made in Italy ; the two have pretty much no relation . In the sixties and seventies , Italian film-makers would get themselves a reputation for ripping off just about every successful American film released . They've not done that here , but Ossessione does follow almost the exact same story as the later American film ' The Postman Always Rings Twice ' , without giving the book's author , James M . Cain , so much as a credit ! Anyway , the plot focuses on Gino Costa , a handsome drifter who , by chance , stumbles upon a café where a woman named Giovanna Bragana works . He soon learns that she's married to Giuseppe ; a big fat annoying man , whom Giovanna can't stand to have even touching her . He wants the pair of them to run away together , but she's not so keen on the idea . However , fate ends up intervening and her plan to have her husband murdered is successful . . . Despite the fact that the film loses some credibility for not crediting the author whose story it's based on , it has to be said that director Luchino Visconti implements the film noir style well , and in a way I even prefer the atmosphere of this film to some of the bigger American noir classics . The story is , as you would expect , extremely strong and the Visconti manages to pull good performances out of his cast . Visconti drags the film out a little bit too much , however , and with a running time of almost 135 minutes , I felt that the story was too thin to warrant this kind of length . I almost feel guilty for levelling all this criticism at Ossessione as it IS a good film , but it's not a ' great ' film . The relationship between the two central characters is never really explored properly , and it seems like the film is keener to distract us from it rather than let us into the characters ' heads . There's not much mystery to the plot as we pretty much always know what's going on , and by not always focusing on the characters themselves ; the film is not as interesting as it could have been . Still , it makes for an interesting viewing and comes recommended for that reason . . . although it's not as good as the 1946 version of the same James M . Cain classic .
421804	2248099	91538	8.0	Almost great modern noir	Mona Lisa is an interesting predecessor to Neil Jordan's later masterpiece ' The Crying Game ' . Taking in many of the same themes as the later film , such as the nature of love , affection and doing what's right , Mona Lisa is an update of the classic film noir tradition that also has obvious ties with other genres such as crime , romance and even comedy . One famous film that I would liken this one to is the Martin Scorsese classic ' Taxi Driver ' , as the two films deal with similar issues and follow a similar structure , but Mona Lisa distances itself from the classic 70's movie because it has a very obvious heart at it's centre . The characterisation in the film is really well done , and it's obvious that writers Neil Jordan and David Leland care a lot about the characters in the movie . The events of the film are almost all a result of character actions , and the plot follows George ; an ex-convict who has just been released from prison . He is given a job ferrying a high-priced call girl around her various jobs . What George doesn't count on is that the contempt he feels for her will turn into affection . Like The Crying Game before it , Mona Lisa is a down and dirty , gritty movie and this styling does the film no end of favours when it comes to portraying the plot . The movie's style bodes well with the themes on display , and it also serves in giving it an edge of realism . However , the film's main downfall is that , while the atmosphere is realistic , the acting largely isn't . Neil Jordan doesn't appear to know how to pull a convincing performance from his stars , especially the female ones , as a lot of the dialogue is delivered in a very forced and phoney sounding manner ; and it can get uncomfortable to view at times . Bob Hoskins does well at the film's core , and what I said about the acting can't always be applied to his performance ; but there are definitely moments when holes begin to appear with him too . Also , like Jordan's masterpiece , the film's soundtrack is sometimes off-cue , and certain songs would have bee better off not being chosen for the soundtrack . However , all of the film's flaws can be forgiven when the film reaches it's explosive conclusion , as it's the perfect end to the film as it allows all of the characters to fully mature , and Bob Hoskins in particular shines at the climax . On the whole , Mona Lisa is a flawed , but still highly admirable piece of work .
422572	2248099	60968	8.0	Looks like it was made on a tramp's budget , but still a great precursor to the exploitation genre !	Shanty Tramp is often mentioned as one of the precursors to the exploitation tradition - and that would certainly seem to be true . While films like Psycho and Peeping Tom had already brought violence to the forefront , this film revels in pure SLEAZE - as while still comparatively tame compared to some later efforts , Shanty Tramp still contains a number of detestable characters including a drunken father , a sinful preacher and , of course , the central character - an insatiable young hussy who uses people for her own enjoyment . The plot focuses on said character as she sets out looking for adventure at other people's expense . She meets a man at a bar , but he ends up getting in a scrap with a black man and is shocked to find that she prefers him ! After rounding up his mates , the men prepare for vengeance upon the black man ; as does the girl's drunken father , who believes his daughter's lies that he raped her and gets ' every white man in town ' looking for him . All this goes on while a shady preacher is busy shouting about the lord ! The film was obviously shot on a very limited budget as the whole thing looks very cheap . Shanty Tramp was shot in black and white , but it's not the fluid black and white picture that adorns many , bigger budgeted , films as this one looks like the filmmakers got a load of film stock on the cheap . The acting too is mostly terrible , and the dialogue is mostly trite ; but all this is unlikely to put off the seasoned exploitation fan , who will no doubt be used to poor production values and non-talented performers . None of this stuff matters anyway , as the real focus of the film is on the shady characters and nasty situations that they find themselves in . The film doesn't feature much blood - and indeed , there is only one real shocking sequence in the entire film , but this is down to the time in which the film was made , and Shanty Tramp is still an excellent early taster of things to come . Overall , this might not be a great film in the classic sense - but I'm sure it had some influence on films that are classics , and it's well worth tracking down both for that reason and for the fact that it's a great deal of fun to watch !
423133	2248099	87800	8.0	Absolute Horror Classic	I'm not a big fan of slashers ; they tend to be a bit dull and samey , but every now and then an intriguing and interesting one comes out , and A Nightmare on Elm Street is most definitely an intriguing and interesting one . The film revolves around Nancy , a young girl that dreams of a badly scarred madman with knives for fingers and a serious grudge against the children of Elm Street . However , Nancy is not the only one having nightmares and the fun really starts when her friends start turning up dead . Freddy Krueger , the badly scarred madman of the piece would go on to become one of cinema's greatest icons . I even dare say he's up there with the likes of King Kong and The Terminator . In the inferior sequels to this movie , Freddy would go on to become something of a comedian ; but here he's every bit the insane madman that slashers would go on to become known for producing . Freddy is brought to the screen by Robert Englund . Robert Englund has managed to get himself something of a cult following for his work on all eight of the Nightmare films , but unfortunately , Freddy is the only ' big ' role in his career . The rest of the cast is made up by John Saxon , who also starred in one of the slasher genre's trend setters ; Black Christmas , among other films ; also appearing is Heather Langenkamp , who would return to the series for part three , and she played herself in the tongue in cheek spin off ; New Nightmare , and of course the movie features the introduction of a man that is close to becoming a film legend ; Johnny Depp . A Nightmare on Elm Street is directed by Wes Craven ; a man that has almost his entire filmography in the horror genre , and has created a number of the genre's milestones along the way ; films such as The Hills Have Eyes , his debut The Last House on the Left and the film that brought slashers back ; Scream are among his best works , but A Nightmare on Elm Street is the film he will always be remembered most for by the majority of horror fanatics . Unfortunately , the Nightmare franchise isn't as respected now as it could have been , due mostly to the amount of lacklustre sequels it spawned . However , don't let those sequels fool you ; the first film is original , inventive , suspenseful and atmospheric , and is without a doubt a classic of the horror genre .
422905	2248099	47976	8.0	Obscure atmospheric horror gem !	Dementia is one weird film ! To sum it up in a nutshell , I'd say it's kind of like a longer and somewhat more macabre version of The Twilight Zone ! The film doesn't include any graphic scenes - although this didn't stop Dementia being banned upon its release in 1955 . The film creates it's horror through atmosphere rather than violence , and the result is rather effective . It has to be said that the narration courtesy of Ed McMahon is more than a little bit cheesy - some have even compared the film to the ' works ' of Ed Wood in that respect ( I personally wouldn't go that far ) - but his voice-over does have a horrific vibe to it , and it certainly benefits the film . Dementia is not exactly plot heavy , and we simply focus on a woman whom we are told is insane . We then follow this woman throughout the night as she gets involved in a series of activities - things such as encounters with various unsavoury characters and other happenings on the dark streets . The film contains no dialogue , and the only speaking part belongs to the narrator . This sets the film apart on it's own as very few films work in this way , and that only adds to its originality . The film achieves it's genuinely unsettling atmosphere via the way that every single character in the film is completely loathsome . It's not hard to see why this film offended the censors back in 1995 . There are a few macabre scenes , though most of the violence is implied rather than shown , and this serves Dementia rather well . The film is very surreal , and a lot of it feels like a nightmare - which is definitely to the film's credit . Watching the central character drift through John Parker's nightmarish dreamscape is entirely captivating , and this is of huge benefit to the film as it completely relies on this in order to succeed . Dementia is unlikely to appeal to everyone due to its frankly odd nature , but it's definitely a film worth seeing . Atmosphere is important in horror films , and this one is PURE atmosphere - highly recommended viewing !
423949	2248099	74226	8.0	Oddball seventies horror , and a rare success for Jeff Lieberman	I've learned not to go into Jeff Lieberman's films with high expectations , as although I liked his latest film ; horror-comedy ' Satan's Little Helper ' , both Squirm and Just Before Dawn did nothing for me , despite high expectations before seeing them . However , Blue Sunshine is surely the director's best film , as it works on both a visceral and psychological level . The film is something of a crossover between the zombie horror subgenre , and a drug fuelled mystery plot . The most effective side of the film , horror-wise , is definitely the idea of silly choices you made as a kid coming back to haunt you as an adult . The plot focuses on a batch of drugs called ' Blue Sunshine ' , which was distributed around a certain college ten years ago . Now the drug is coming back to haunt the users by way of hair-loss , headaches , nightmares and an insatiable desire to kill people . We follow Jerry Zipkin , a young man that ends up at the centre of the trouble and decides to get the bottom of the mystery , which centres on a politician trying to get elected by way of a publicity drive . I suppose the main reason why I'm not Jeff Lieberman's biggest fan is because his films often lack bite and don't move swiftly enough . This one is no different on that front , except this time ; instead of merely focusing on a bunch of worms , or yet another troupe of deformed , deranged backwoods killers ; Lieberman has the advantage of an intriguing mystery to base his film on . While it's always obvious where it's going , the director manages to get the audience to care about what's going to happen , and as drugs and their effects are intriguing subjects anyway ; there's always enough to keep things ticking over . Lieberman also injects sequences that see various characters lose their hair before trying to kill anyone and everyone in the vicinity , and these too make the final package more intriguing - the sequence that sees a nanny take out her lust for violence out on a couple of irritating kids being the highlight in that respect . Overall , it has to be said that the film isn't perfect - not everything is perfectly judged , and it could have been streamlined better . Furthermore , it ends prematurely and feels a bit lazy ; but even so , Blue Sunshine is an excellent little flick and comes highly recommended .
421989	2248099	264508	8.0	Stuart Gordon does HP Lovecraft , with great results again !	From almost the same team that brought us the classic horror Re-Animator sixteen years previously , comes this HP Lovecraft-adapted flick . We've got Stuart Gordon in the director's chair and Brian Yuzna producing , leaving out only cult star Jeffrey Combs . . . who would , actually , have made a great lead ; but never mind . Based on the short stories ' Dagon ' and ' The Shadow Over Innsmouth ' , Dagon has Lovecraft written all over it and follows a fishing village by the name of Imboca . In return for fish and gold , the locals there have taken to worshipping the deity ' Dagon ' . However , this has taken its toll ; as the locals now exist in the form of deformed fish-men ! That's what I love about Lovecraft , he always finds time for deformities and monsters in his stories - which almost always ensures that they're more frightening than most . We follow Paul ; a young man who , along with his friends , become shipwrecked near to Imboca . After venturing to the village in search of a phone and his girlfriend , our hero finds himself trapped and about to be sacrificed to the villager's god ! Dagon is a really good film , and certainly one of the best of this decade ; but despite the talented people behind it , it's still not quite great . The acting is a major letdown , with Ezra Godden doing his best Jeffrey Combs impression ; but personally , I'd rather have seen the man himself . Francisco Rabal died shortly after the release of this film , which is a shame ; but he doesn't have enough screen time to make a lasting impression . The rest of the cast drowns the film where the acting is concerned . It's also rather badly plotted , and gets off to a very slow start ; which is liable to turn some viewers off immediately . Once it gets going , however , it really gets going ; and by then , the acting and plotting don't matter , as it's the special effects and invention that become the stars of the show . The effects look like they should look rubbish , but they really don't . The fish-people actually look good ! The gore is ample , but never gratuitous and the imagination behind the story is immense , and could only have come from the mind of one of the horror genre's great masters . This is no Re-Animator ; but it's a more than decent example of the fact that good horror is still being made !
423121	2248099	450843	8.0	Smart and intriguing Satanic horror !	The French have pretty much proved themselves to be the kings of modern horror cinema over the course of this decade . Films such as Malefique , In My Skin and Inside show what the French can do ; and as a result of these films , I generally go into any modern French horror expecting great things . Sheitan is yet another excellent French horror film that works thanks to its untypical approach , mysterious atmosphere and great lead performance by Vincent Cassel . The plot focuses on a group of friends that exit a disco late one night after a fight that resulted in one of them taking a bottle in the face . They hook up with a girl called Eve ; who suggests that they escape to her house in the country . They get to the farmhouse and are greeted by a bunch of goats and the strange housekeeper , who takes a strange sort of liking to one of the boys . The group enjoys themselves at the house and spend most of their time trying to get the girls into bed ; but soon it becomes apparent that something is wrong with the housekeeper . . . The way that the plot moves really is the best thing about this film . It's all held together very loosely and the plot itself has free reign basically to go wherever it wants ; and this results in a film that constantly feels fresh and inventive as you never really know where it is going to go next . The film relies on its characters to move the story forward and they are a colourful bunch ; the housekeeper and the boy he ' befriends ' in particular share an interesting relationship . The way that the film plays out is very strange for a Satanic horror film as despite some symbolism and discussions of religion during the film ; there's not a great deal in the way of hints that the film even is Satanic horror . Vincent Cassel's character is the real standout of the film in terms of the performances ; and he truly succeeds in creating an extremely intriguing horror villain that is interesting and detestable in equal measures . The film does begin to crumble somewhat towards the end and I was really worried that we were going to get a Switchblade Romance-style cop out ending , but luckily it gets corrected in time and the conclusion is a shocker . Overall , Sheitan is an excellent movie and one that will surely improve with subsequent viewings . Recommended !
421740	2248099	264761	8.0	Daring and original portrayal of romance	This movie is often described as ' When Sally met Sally . . . ' , and that is an accurate portrayal of what this movie is . It's a love story like any other , but this story is different . We have the normal ' two people meet and fall in love ' scenario , but the difference here is that these two characters are the same sex , and that's what sets the film apart from it's counterparts . The central character is the lady from the title ; Jessica Stein . Jessica is caught in a New York metropolis ; populated by shallow people , people that are more interested in setting dates up with their friends and learning the dictionary cover to cover than they are in forming proper relations with people . This is the reason that Jessica can't find herself a man , she isn't happy to settle for second best and she wants more from a relationship than any man she knows can give her . So , after being told why she can't find herself a man by her big-headed colleague , Josh Myers ; Jessica decides to step outside of her box a little and answers an ad in the ' women seeking women ' section of the newspaper . Enter Helen Cooper ; the lady that placed the ad , and seasoned bi-sexual . She's sexy , quirky , funny and all together lovable ; as Jessica says at one point ; " Who wouldn't want to have sex with you ? " , and that is my thoughts entirely . At first , Jessica is cautious , she is predominantly straight at the end of the day and she's in over her head at first . However , the two hit it off almost immediately , and we get to watch their romance blossom . The fact that lesbianism ( or homosexuality in general ) is taboo is always apparent throughout this film . Helen is more of a free spirit , and the only friends of hers that we see are gay anyway , so she is always open about it . It's not the same story for Jessica , however ; she's always been straight , so being open about such a relationship isn't so easy for her . That's the second half of this story ; not only is it a comedy ; it's also a social commentary , and it rings true not just for this subject ; but just about anything that people do that isn't of the norm . The two leads are played very well by Jennifer Westfeldt ( Jessica ) and Heather Juergensen ( Helen ) . These two not only do the acting , but they also wrote the film . It is evident that women wrote it , as it has a very feminine feel throughout . There is no sex in the movie , which might disappoint some viewers and instead the movie focuses on the relationship between the women and the impact that it has on their lives . This is a very good thing , as what could have been lost in a myriad of nudity and sexual innuendo , actually comes off as a very personal study of a taboo relationship . The film is also very funny . The humour on offer isn't overly blatant , and is mostly very dry ; but it's definitely there and certain moments of the film literally had me in stitches . Despite all that I've so far , however ; this movie isn't perfect . The character of Jessica , although obviously born of the social-conscious New York atmosphere , and therefore it is to be expected , sometimes goes over the top and can come across as being very annoying . Aside from that , the film features far too much music . It's practically saturated in it , and it's always that sad women's elevator music that I hate . The film also loses steam in it's third act , and never regains the humour and pace of the first two . Like ( too ) many romance films , Kissing Jessica Stein features an ambiguous ending . Call me old fashioned , but I like a film to end properly and therefore I don't like ambiguous endings , so that was a turn-off for me . However , Kissing Jessica Stein is an underrated gem and is most definitely romantic comedy at the top of it's game . See it , you won't regret it .
422958	2248099	765443	8.0	An excellent follow-up to the masterpiece , A History of Violence .	Normally I'd consider it a shame when a horror director breaks out of my favourite genre and starts making other types of films ; but when that director is making films as good as Eastern Promises and 2005's A History of Violence , who can possibly complain ? Cronenberg has never followed the mainstream , and while he didn't write this and A History of Violence himself , both films are still very anti-mainstream and it's not hard to see why he took on both projects . I didn't really think there was much room left for ingenuity in the crime genre ; but by setting the film in London and putting the focus on the Russian Mafia , Cronenberg has found an area not often explored . The film focuses on the Vory V Zakone crime syndicate , and in particular a restaurant owning family headed by a man named Semyon . The story starts when a young girl dies during childbirth on a midwife named Anna's shift . Anna finds the diary of the deceased and it leads her to Semyon's restaurant . There , she is introduced to Semyon's bad son Kirill and a driver named Nikolia , and the diary turns out to be of great importance for the family . As you would probably expect , the film is professionally made and the production values are excellent ; so I wont waste too much of this review going on about that . The most important thing about this film is the story , and it's carried off excellently . Full of double meanings , most of them surrounding retribution ; it's a story that entertains on the surface and has enough depth for anyone wanting to look a little further into it . Eastern Promises is bolstered by an excellent performance from Viggo Mortensen . This actor has really impressed me , having surfaced as a result of Lord of the Rings ; and Mortensen has proved himself as an actor capable of great performances during his two collaborations with David Cronenberg . He thoroughly convinces in this film , and it would be hard for anyone not already knowing that he's American to think that he is not Russian . Luckily , the film was passed uncut by the censors in the UK , and that is a very good thing as the brutal violence is one of the key elements , though it is never overused . The film kicks off with a bloody throat slitting , and the best sequence in the movie features Mortensen fighting in the nude with two rival gang members . The ending is the only thing that disappointed me ; generally I think that ninety minutes is about the optimum running time for a film , but I'd have been happier for this one to go on twenty minutes longer and ended with more closure . Still , Eastern Promises is one of the first truly great films that I've seen this year and I'll be surprised if I see many better . A great achievement for everyone involved !
422920	2248099	416320	8.0	A change of environment proves lucky for Woody Allen	Every film that Woody Allen releases is automatically a point of interest for me , especially when the film in question has won itself a lot of favourable reviews . Match Point sees Allen in new territory as his beloved New York has been swapped for London , England . Despite this relocation , however , Match Point is still very clearly a Woody Allen film . The film is mostly a romantic drama , but as the story moves forward ; thriller elements start to creep through , and best of all we get a very potent streak of black humour to round things off . The plot typically features the central character in turmoil . We are introduced to former tennis star turned coach , Chris Wilton . He's looking for a meaning to his life and wants to do something different from tennis . After meeting a man named Tom , Chris finds himself the object of Tom's sister Chloe's affections . However , our tennis star has his eyes on Tom's finance ; Nola . After having an affair with Nola , Chris finds himself at decision-making time . Because as we all know ; you can't have two women for long . The film starts off with a sequence in which the protagonist tells us about a tennis ball hitting the top of a net during a game . If it carries on going , your luck is in ; but if it falls back , it isn't . Woody Allen keeps this luck theme going throughout the film , and the way that he harks back to the opening scene towards the end of the film is just great . Being from the UK myself , I was interested to see how Allen would handle the London setting . I've got to say , however , that I'm a bit upset about the fact that he has decided to set the film in the upper crust of society . It's not so difficult for me to relate to upper class New York because I'm not from America ; but as far as I'm concerned , the environment seen in this film doesn't really exist . . . but at least the English characters have English accents . The acting is fine , with Jonathan Rhys Meyers doing well in the lead role and hitting all the right notes as his character changes his stripes later on . Scarlett Johansson is his opposite number and delivers an emotional portrayal as the put-upon mistress , while Emily Mortimer is suitably posh to round off the central threesome . I loved the way the tale climaxes and I'm glad that Allen didn't continue along the lines that many films of this nature are happy to stay between . Overall , I can't say that this is Allen's best effort ; but it's a very good one , and the director has been showing good consistency over the last few years .
421694	2248099	91954	8.0	Hellish romance in the core of the British punk era	Sid and Nancy depicts the morbidly fascinating story of the tragic love between the Sex Pistols bassist , Sid Vicious and his American girlfriend , Nancy Spungen . The film is set in the peak of the British punk era , and aside from the story at the centre of the tale ; the film makes the best of it's surroundings . Depicting numerous controversial incidents , director Alex Cox puts us firmly in the centre of this era . The location choices of seedy bars and even seedier lodgings help to give the film a downtrodden " I don't care " sort of feel , and this compliments the love story excellently . The love story itself isn't your conventional boy meets girl romance , as the two parties are clearly high on drugs throughout most of the film and there isn't a lot of the touching side of romance on display . However , as the band at the core of this film were keen to stick two fingers up at conventions , the film does the same for the common love story . The scenes that see Nancy take her love home to her grandparent's house show this best , and are skilfully done , and are funny in an absurd , hellish sort of a way . The acting is fabulous , particularly from the male side of the two leads . Gary Oldman gives a stunning performance as the punk rocker Sid Vicious , perfectly capturing both the uncaring punk side of the man , and also the deeper , darker side of his personality . Chloe Webb isn't quite his equal , however ; as although her performance as the highly strung American broad isn't bad by a long shot ; she has a tendency to get very annoying at times , which takes some credibility away from her performance . Throughout , the film is like a car wreck ; despite the hellishness of the events that unfold , the film remains interesting and it is nigh on impossible to take your eyes away from what's befalling the lead characters . Alex Cox's scene staging is really well done , and several sequences will stay with you long after the film is over . The aforementioned dinner scene , which also doubles up as my favourite scene in the movie , is one ; while Vicious ' rendition of Frank Sinatra's " My Way " marks another . On the whole , while this isn't one of the truly great love stories that cinema has produced , it's a very good one ; and you don't have to be a fan of the Sex Pistols to think so .
422529	2248099	60608	8.0	Very cool crime caper from Umberto Lenzi	Umberto Lenzi is best known for his gory zombie flicks , Giallo's and Italian Cop movies ; but there are a few gems from other genres dotted around his filmography , and Kriminal is definitely one of the best of them ! The film is based on a comic book and follows the fortunes of a ' cartoon ' criminal out to steal whatever he can . The obvious film to compare this to would be Mario Bava's pulp fiction thriller ' Diabolik ' , although this one is ( slightly ) more grounded in reality and while it doesn't have the comic book grandeur of Bava's later effort ; all in all , I wouldn't hesitate to call Kriminal a better film . Glenn Saxson takes the lead role as ' Kriminal ' - a notorious yet incognito thief who wears a skeleton suit and somehow manages to get the better of the police every time they try to stop him from stealing . The plot starts properly when an opportunity to steal a large amount of diamonds from a safe deposit box in Instanbul presents itself . Kriminal masterminds a plot to liberate the jewels ; but first has to worm his way into several people's affections . The film has a great comic book style and Umberto Lenzi effortlessly manages to give the film a real stylish verve that benefits the plot immensely . Glenn Saxson might not be a great actor , but he fits the bill as the title character and actually looks like he might be a drawing from a comic book himself ! The film features Kriminal wearing a suit painted as a skeleton ; although unfortunately this part of the film doesn't come off as being as cool as it could have been ; but it does give the film an extra interesting element . There are plenty of characters to move the plot along , and while the plotting does get a little confusing at times ; it's generally interesting enough . Lenzi manages some really beautiful locations and he definitely gets the best out of ' high society ' in Istanbul . There are also a number of lovely ladies on display , which is always a bonus too ! There's no real point to the film ; but the ending is good enough and the film finishes in a ' fun ' way . Overall , I'm not surprised that this isn't one of Lenzi's better known films - but it's certainly not a bad one and I highly recommend seeing it . . . if you can find it !
423637	2248099	87015	8.0	C ( an't ) H ( think of a ) U ( clever ) D ( abbreviation )	I was once a big fan of cheesy eighties horror movies ; but just lately , mostly owing to my having seen a number a bad ones , the eighties trash flick just hasn't done much for me . This ensured that I went into C . H . U . D . with the lowest of expectations ; but to my surprise , the film turned out to be one of the very best pieces of eighties trash that I've seen ! While it's very obvious at all times that the film was made by people of little talent and with no budget to work with ; somehow , C . H . U . D . manages to stay effective , interesting and entertaining for the duration . The film takes place in New York and the story focuses on a series of murders that have been happening in the city and seem to have some link to the underground sewer system . A journalist , as well as a soup kitchen guy and a police officer , suspect that there's something down in the sewers ; and their story is supported by a young girl who claims that a ' monster ' took her grandfather . Naturally their stories are passed off as insanity at first , but soon it becomes apparent that there really is something in the sewer . The sewer seems to be a popular place for eighties horror to take place ; Slugs , Alligator and The Blob to name but a few are all heavily linked to the sewer system . It's not really surprising either ; as this setting helps to give a film a truly dank and dirty atmosphere ; and C . H . U . D . really benefits from that as we really feel like we're in the underbelly of New York . Perhaps the best thing about the film is the two lead actors who apparently were the major driving force behind the film getting made . John Heard and , in particular , Daniel Stern , give excellent performances in the lead roles and manage to keep the film entertaining for its duration . Typically for a no budget horror movie ; the effects are not particularly great , but the creature design is imaginative and the effects are at least fun to watch . The film is not greatly suspenseful for its duration and the plot hinges on a lot of clichés ; but things do get tenser as we rev towards the ending and the last set piece is very well done . The final climax itself is disappointing , however , and feels like they simply ran out of budget . Overall , C . H . U . D . is far from great ; but it is fun to watch and is a must see for any fan of eighties horror !
423926	2248099	44876	8.0	Classic Ealing Gem	The Man in the White Suit is one of those delightful comedies that Ealing studies made so well in the 40's and 50's . The plot of this one follows a man that invents a cloth that neither gets dirty nor breaks . Of course , this is a huge breakthrough in the world of textiles . However , things are not that simple as the cloth will threaten the way of life of many people , including cloth manufacturers , the cloth mill's workforces , and even an old lady that does her washing every week . The Man in the White Suit is a film about scientific advances , and the way that they don't always help ; as the old woman says at one point in the movie , " Why cant you scientists just leave things alone ? " Like a lot Ealing comedies , this one stars Sir Alec Guinness . Alec Guinness is a fantastic actor ; he has the ability to light up the screen with his presence ( and he does in this film , literally ) , but he also manages to portray his characters in a down to earth and believable way . He is suitably creepy in this film , and he captures just the right atmosphere for his character ; an intelligent and ambitious , but slightly naive scientist . Along with Guinness , The Man in the White Suit also features Joan Greenwood , the deep voiced actress that co-starred with Guinness in the simply divine " Kind Hearts and Coronets " and Michael Gough , a man that would go on to get himself the role of Alfred in the Batman films . The acting in the film isn't always great , but it is always decent , and it's fits with the film . The Man in the White Suit is an intelligent , thought-provoking and witty comedy with a moral . The comedy isn't always obvious , and it doesn't always work , but the film is not meant to be a film that provokes belly laughs , so that is forgivable . I recommend this movie , basically , to anyone that is a fan of movies .
422839	2248099	71233	8.0	Great and very original take on the classic vampire tale	Blood for Dracula definitely takes the prize for the most odd take on the classic story that I've ever seen . Not that I'm saying that in a bad way , however ; not at all , it's most definitely a good thing ! Director Paul Morrissey has created a horror movie that is camp to the point that it pokes fun at the European style that it is a part of . Udo Kier stars as the title character , but he's not the Dracula that have horror fans have come to expect . . . not at all . It is with the character that this movie's main element of originality comes into play . We are used to seeing the count being all-powerful and drinking the blood of numerous victims , but here the king of vampires doesn't quite appear to be himself . The Dracula in this movie is a frail man , almost at the point of death . He needs the blood of virgins in order to maintain himself , but the girls in his native Romania are somewhat less than innocent . He therefore decides to travel to Italy , as it's a religious country and that is leading him to believe that the girls there will still have their innocence intact . The story picks up when Dracula is invited to stay at the home of a family with four daughters . Blood for Dracula is an extremely sleazy movie , and despite being primarily about vampirism ; there's far more nudity than gore in the film . In fact , the film isn't even all that gory for the most part , and it's only the ending that goes all out for sick gore . The story is well done and inventive , particularly during the moments when Dracula drinks the girls ' blood , only to find that she wasn't a virgin after all . Seeing the count writhe in pain after drinking the wrong blood isn't something you will see in many takes on the classic story ; so this version gets plaudits for that . It also gets plaudits for an outstanding performance from the great cult actor Udo Kier . His screen presence fits the role that Morrissey has given him like a glove , and Kier impresses throughout the film . The obscure element of humour is nice and gives the film a real cult movie feel . Because the film is so absurd , it wont be enjoyed by all viewers . But if you like your horror to be different and inventive , you could do a hell of a lot worse than this flick !
422401	2248099	55630	8.0	Just another masterful movie from the master of masterful movies	Akira Kurosawa's tribute to the western is a marvelous piece of cinema . Toshirô Mifune stars as a ronin ( samurai without a master ) that goes to a small town , which is divided by two gangs of criminals . While there , he decides to play one off against the other in order to defeat both gangs . Yojimbo lacks the depth of some of Kurosawa's other films , such as Rashomon or Seven Samurai , but it is , on the whole , more entertaining and much more accessible than those two mentioned films , and most of the rest of Kurosawa's oeuvre . That's not to say that Yojimbo lacks substance however ; there's more than enough here to please fans of Kurosawa's other works . Just like the majority of Kurosawa's films , Yojimbo is spectacularly well filmed . The black and white cinematography looks absolutely incredible , and the some of the scenes , in particular that involve rain , are extremely atmospheric and lend the movie a great gloomy style . Toshirô Mifune's performance in this film is , in my opinion , his best . Mifune has been in some great films and given some great performances , many of them under the direction of Kurosawa ; but the one here eclipses them all in my opinion . In this film , Mifune is most definitely the ' star ' . In many other Kurosawa films , Seven Samurai especially , Mifune hasn't been alone , and although he isn't alone here either ; he has to carry the film a lot more than he has had to with other films , and he does a great job of it . The answer to the question of whether or not he is believable in his role isn't even debatable ; he is . So believable in fact that it's hard to believe that he's an actor playing a samurai , and not an actual samurai . Like a western , Yojimbo features several weird characters that add to the feel of the movie . The actors playing these smaller roles aren't as pronounced , or indeed as great as Toshirô Mifune ; but they all still excel in their small roles , making the support cast a very nice ensemble indeed . Yojimbo's influence can be felt across cinema . I dread to think how great cinema might not have been if the Japanese master ; Akira Kurosawa had never picked up a camera . His body of work has influenced so many styles and genres that the mind literally boggles . If he never had made a film . . . well , it doesn't even bear thinking about . It is well known that for one , Yojimbo was remade into Sergio Leone's ' A Fistful of Dollars ' , which in turn kick started Leone's career . That's just one great director we may have been without had it not been for Kurosawa . That's not all Yojimbo has had an impact on ; the Spaghetti western sub-genre is littered with influence from this film , and even recent favourites such as Kill Bill have obviously taken influence from this masterpiece . Of course , cinema would be no worse off if Kill Bill was never made ; but it's still credit to Yojimbo . Overall , every film fan should see Yojimbo . It's too important a film to miss , and not only that but it's guaranteed to give you 105 minutes of enjoyment . Highest recommendations from me .
422717	2248099	443496	8.0	Excellent story of a man walking the streets at night	I wasn't really sure what to expect of this film going into it ; it sounded nothing like the gory horror movies that Stuart Gordon made his name with , and I had little faith for him branching out after seeing the disappointing King of the Ants . Edmond is a simple thriller ; just focusing on one man and if I had to compare it to other films , I would say this is something like After Hours meets American Beauty . While the film doesn't have a lot of plot , the director actually uses this to his advantage as the freewheeling approach gives the plot more opportunity for anything to happen , and the story isn't bound in any way . The film begins when Edmond is told by a fortune teller that he " doesn't belong here " . He then goes home to tell his wife that he's leaving her because he's bored and doesn't love her . Edmond then sets off into the night , apparently in search of a woman but more likely not really in search of anything . Edmond walks the night and meets various people , eventually leading to violence and a place for Edmond to find himself . A lot of the burden of this film is put on lead star William H . Macy , and of course the actor that has impressed in almost everything he's been in since Fargo doesn't disappoint . Macy's performance is uncomfortable to watch and pathetic , but always fascinating . There is a range of events that happen in the movie and the way that plot pans out ensures that the audience is always interested to see what happens next . The majority of the film takes place on the streets in one night and director Stuart Gordon does an excellent job of building up a dark and muggy atmosphere to go with the dark themes of the story . The screenplay is written by ace screenwriter David Mamet and is adapted from his own play . This film sits nicely alongside his work in the thriller genre with films such as Glengarry Glen Ross and House of Games . You can never predict how this film is going end - and indeed , the way it ends is anything but predictable . I'm not sure how well it will go down with most viewers - but there is one thing you can't deny , it is memorable . Overall , Edmond comes highly recommended .
422048	2248099	486822	8.0	Does justice to Hitchcock's Rear Window - an excellent modern thriller !	Like most serious horror fans , I'm not pleased by the way that the genre is being flooded by too many remakes ! A modern re-imaging of Alfred Hitchcock's classic ' Rear Window ' therefore didn't seem too promising on paper , but director D . J . Caruso has done an excellent job with this film ! It takes all the things that made Rear Window a classic , adds in a modern twist and keeps the whole piece just different enough for Disturbia not to feel like a rip-off ! Rather than a broken leg , our protagonist this time around is housebound via a modern means . After a family tragedy , Kale finds himself frustrated and angry , and a smart comment from his Spanish teacher ends up with the teacher on the floor and the Kale under house arrest , enforced by an electronic tag that puts an automatic call into the police station if he's more than 100 years away from his house for more than 10 seconds . Bored , he turns to the window , where he discovers sexy new neighbour Ashley . . . and something more sinister in the form of ' Mr Turner ' - the next door neighbour whom Kale comes to believe may be a Texan serial killer . . . Disturbia is brought to life by an excellent cast , who all perform excellently in their respective roles . Shia LeBeouf is thoroughly likable in the central role ; giving it a nice mix of angsty teenager and curious rogue . Sarah Roemer and Aaron Yoo fill out the other two young persons ' roles nicely , while Carrie-Anne Moss convinces as the mother - and David Morse gives his best performance in years as the villain of the piece ! Being more used to seeing him in more gentle roles in films such as The Green Mile , it's surprising to see just how well he fits into the bad guy role . Director D . J . Caruso , who previously made the less than brilliant Taking Lives , does a real good job of providing the thrills with Disturbia . The film works on two levels ; on the one hand , it's a teen drama and on the other it's a thriller and these two elements mix brilliantly . At times , the tension is almost unbearable - and it's that which made Rear Window such a blast fifty three years earlier ! Overall , this might not be completely original - but it's a great thriller in spite of that fact , and I'm sure it will appeal to most members of the audience . Highly recommended !
423493	2248099	59764	8.0	An excellent Holmes mystery !	I'm a big fan of the original Universal Sherlock Holmes series and while there have been attempts by other studios to make films based on the classic character by Arthur Conan Doyle , only Hammer Horror's take on The Hound of the Baskervilles has come close to touching the majesty of Universal's films . However , for my money , A Study in Terror is both an excellent take on Sherlock Holmes and certainly one of the best films about the great London detective outside of Universal's efforts . This film is not based on an actual story by Arthur Conan Doyle and instead we get a story in same style as Doyle's that pits Sherlock against another notable historical figure , Jack the Ripper . Sherlock Holmes becomes interested in a series of murders happening around Whitechapel with prostitutes as the victims after a parcel containing a set of surgical instruments is anonymously delivered to his address . After inspecting the case , he soon comes up with some clues and begins following the trail which leads him to the seedy underbelly of Victorian London . . . It seems this film was directly trying to imitate the classic Universal ones as the two lead actors are very similar to Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce . Neither is as good , of course , but John Neville gives an excellent performance as the eloquent detective , while Donald Houston is right on cue as Holmes ' understudy . The film also features the good natured humour of the earlier series and that makes the film more enjoyable to watch . Director James Hill does an excellent job of creating an atmosphere for the film ; the foggy streets of London are great and suitably fit the macabre storyline . The story itself is an interesting one and it plays out well also . The mystery is constantly engaging and the few murders featured are enough to spice it up . The story features enough red herrings and clues to keep the audience and Holmes guessing and the mystery elements are certainly satisfying enough . The identity of the ripper is not abundantly obvious by the end and the film's conclusion is good . Overall , I enjoyed this film very much and can certainly recommend it to my fellow Holmes fans !
423827	2248099	413300	8.0	Spider-Man swings back in style !	Well , I've been looking forward to this movie ever since I walked out of Spider-Man 2 , and despite all the bad things I've heard about it - Spider-Man 3 certainly didn't disappoint ! Sure , you could spend all day picking faults with the film if you really wanted to , but what's the point ? The first two films set the bar very high for comic book movies , and this film is not a disappointment considering what went before it . I have to say that I'm not a ' Spiderman fanboy ' and have , in fact , not even read the comics ; but that is testament to the brilliance of Sam Raimi's vision as he has managed to turn Spider-Man into a franchise that is accessible to everyone . The plot this time around is far more complex than in the last two . Spider-Man's celebrity status has grown among the people of New York City . His private life is going well also . However , good things never last long ; and Spider-Man is about to face a threat from his former best friend Harry Osborne who wants revenge for the death of his father , as well as a ' simian ' life form from another planet and the return of his uncle's killer , this time in the guise of powerful new villain ' Sandman ' . The most outstanding thing about this film is definitely the special effects . The fight scenes are brilliantly realised , and Sam Raimi certainly knows how to put a thrilling compilation together . The Sandman provides Spider-Man 3 with its best visuals , as the Terminator 2-style villain switches between sand and flesh in style , and the director constantly makes good use of this set-up . The visuals are obviously important in a film like this , and the film contains many a memorable scene . The best of these sequences come in the form of the creation of the villains , and while it has to be said that the way they come about is a little convenient ( Sandman stumbles upon a nuclear experiment with sand . . . ) , it's not too difficult to believe since the film takes place in a world where a human / spider hybrid fights criminals in New York City . Popular Spider-Man villain Venom makes an appearance also , albeit it a brief one . However , the way that his character is built up makes up for the lack of screen time that the resulting villain has . One of the most common problems viewers have picked out with this film is the fact that there are a lot of different plot lines going on . It's true that the film does become more than a little bit complex and the new characters suffer as a result of that . But the Spider-Man Universe is obviously a vast one , and Sam Raimi had a lot on his plate when it came to writing a story that would please the fans , stay true to the comics and entertain the audience . He actually juggles the numerous plot threads very well , as most of the points get across and the impending plot holes aren't enough to spoil anyone's enjoyment . Sam Raimi's sense of humour is brilliant , it was obvious that the likes of J . K . Simmons and B-movie legend Bruce Campbell were going to provide comic relief ( and they do ) , but the funniest thing about the film for me was Peter Parker's reaction to the black suit . In a sequence that seems to be rather widely disliked , Spidey goes from geeky physics student to a ( sort of ) suave lady-killer with hilarious results . The sequence shows a lot more imagination than many directors would have given the idea of a superhero turned ' dark ' . The acting is largely decent also . The returning characters all give performances that you would expect from there , while the new additions fit in well . Thomas Hayden Church pretty much sleepwalks through his role , but he's still an asset to the film as he completely looks and feels like he has come straight out of a comic book ! Topher Grace is slimy and irritating as he should be , and the sequence immediately before he changes into Venom says a lot about his character . Overall , Spider-Man 3 is not exactly a perfect film - but it's certainly an entertaining one and I know for sure that I'll be seeing it again !
423578	2248099	59846	8.0	Excellent Krimi thriller !	I've only just really started getting into the Krimi genre and most of the ones I have seen so far have been the later entries which were in colour . As such , one of the things I like most about this type of film is the wacky colour schemes ; yet although The Sinister Monk is shot in black and white and thus doesn't feature one , it's still a very nice film to look at and also provides an interesting and entertaining mystery - ensuring that The Sinister Monk is one of the very best Krimi flicks that I've seen so far ! The plot is , as usual , based on a novel by British crime writer Edgar Wallace and this time focuses on a family in turmoil over the distribution of a family will . It turns out that the late patriarch of the family intended to leave all of his wealth to his favourite granddaughter Gwendolyn ; a fact that doesn't exactly go down well with the rest of the scheming family . Naturally , they plot to ensure that the granddaughter doesn't get what's coming to her ; but things are complicated when a monk with a whip shows up and starts picking people off ! The plot is not exactly original and has literally been seen a hundred times before in mystery thrillers - but the film is made good by Edgar Wallace's strange approach and we get a plot peppered with things such as the whip wielding monk ( evidently a Wallace favourite ) , a wall full of death masks and a revelation involving carrier pigeons ! Naturally , the film doesn't always completely make sense and sometimes you just have to go along with it ; but really , that is what makes this film so much fun to watch . There's plenty of entertainment and since the film is only short at about eighty minutes , the runtime is rather crowded - but that is a benefit if you ask me ! The cinematography is just great ; the black and white picture adds a real foreboding atmosphere to the film and the fog-drenched castle in which most of the film takes place makes for a really great central location . It all boils down to an unexpected and silly conclusion ; but it's satisfying enough , despite feeling a little bit too rushed . Overall , The Sinister Monk is an excellent little film and I can certainly recommend it !
422892	2248099	95705	9.0	Incredibly funny comedy	What makes The Naked Gun so funny is it's small moments ; things like when Leslie Nielson knocks a fisherman of the pier when parking his car , when he and Priscilla Presley come out of a movie laughing , only for the audience to see that the movie they just left was ' Platoon ' , the part at the baseball game where a fan shouts " It's Enrico Pallazzo ! " ; those are the really funny moments in The Naked Gun . That's not to say the bigger gags , such as the part where Detective Nordberg is shot or the thing with the fish don't work , but it's the film's attention to detail that is most definitely it's main asset . The Naked Gun opens with an utterly hilarious sequence which sees a police siren , obviously atop of a police car parade through all sorts of areas that it isn't supposed to , all done to a backdrop of very farcical music . From this point on , you know you're going to be in for a lot of silliness , and if it's silliness you want , The Naked Gun is definitely your film . The plot of the movie is largely irrelevant , and serves only as a means to spoof several clichés of the police thriller genre ; which is all the plot should serve as in a gag based comedy such as this . Leslie Nielson is the perfect man for this sort of film , as he has proved over and over ; even when he's stood doing nothing he looks silly ; he has a look that is made for comedy , and this is his finest hour . This movie is also the finest hour for the ZAZ team ; unlike with the messy and largely unfunny " Airplane ! " , they've managed to get almost everything spot on here . The jokes are funny ; for every one that doesn't work , there's twenty that do , the lead man is on top form and the situation is silly enough to provide lots of room for gags , and that room is filled as far as is possible . If you're more a fan of intelligent comedy , then I recommend checking out The Naked Gun anyway because I very much doubt that anyone can sit through this movie without laughing . Forget " Airplane ! " , THIS is the finest ZAZ comedy .
423010	2248099	87909	9.0	The Lady of the Flies vs Argento's twisted horror imagination !	Opinions on Phenomena are divided amongst Argento fans . It's not quite a love it or hate it film , but rather a like it or dislike it one . There's enough of Argento here to ensure that his fans will enjoy it , but it also marks a change of pace for him . While his previous films focused mainly on the mystery in the plot , the focus this time is clearly on the action ; and the heavy metal soundtrack shows that Argento wanted to make this more of a thriller than a Giallo , and I think he's succeeded admirably . Argento has said that this movie came about after the great director heard about insects ' supposed telepathy , and the fact that the film has stemmed from this sort of idea shows by the way that the plot pans out . First of all , we are bombarded with the idea of insect telepathy , and when we get round to the murders and murderer , it almost feels like something from another film . However , while the plot is messy ; it does give Argento lots of room for horror , which he capitalises on at every opportunity . We follow Jennifer Corvino , an actor's daughter who attends a school in Switzerland , which is also having problems with a local murderer . She's not quite like the other girls , however , as she has a strange connection with the insect population . . . Dario Argento has piled many ideas into this plot , and it's clear that it's not very well thought out as he seems to drop another idea in every time he feels like the plot needs spicing up a little bit . This is a problem for the movie , as it feels underdone and very messy ; but on the other hand , this is also the movie's finest asset as it ensures that the film is always unpredictable and therefore constantly thrilling . The heavy metal music that accompanies the death scenes seems odd in this movie , as we're used to very pungent music scores in Argento films . It does suit the film's mood , however , and it helps give the film that trashy eighties horror movie feel , which is much loved by eighties horror fans like me . The cast is a good one and it features Argento regular , Daria Nicolodi along with established horror actor Donald Pleasance and a very young Jenifer Connelly . None of the cast massively impress , but they come together well as an ensemble and the acting is of a quality that is high enough to carry this sort of film . On the whole , this isn't Argento's best work . It's messy and convoluted , but it's also fun to watch , thrilling and very inventive .
422027	2248099	734580	9.0	Prime episode of the show !	It's a Good Life is one of the best known episodes of The Twilight Zone - and for good reason , as it's easily one of the best episodes of the classic TV show . Of course , the great parody that The Simpsons did of it contributes to its well-known status , but there's far more here than merely a base for a ' Treehouse of Horror ' segment . We are introduced to a little town ; a town with no cars , no machines and it's in a world with no cities or other settlements . We are told that this town is the victim of a monster who controls it with his mind - and just wait until you see who the monster is ! The best episodes of The Twilight Zone are the ones that combine mystery with intrigue and ingenuity ; thus making this one of the best episodes . It's a Good Life is also very humorous , and when the characters say everything is ' good ' , it's hard not to at least crack a smile . There isn't a great deal of ' bite ' in this episode , as it mainly concentrates on the implications of the storyline , and it's mostly dialogue based ; but it doesn't matter because the words uttered are always entertaining and overall ; this is a major success .
422684	2248099	69947	9.0	Brilliant classic thriller !	What we have here is a top quality thriller from Fred Zinnemann ! The film is based on the book by Frederick Forsyth and follows a story surrounding the assassination of French president , Charles de Gaulle . The film is , apparently , historically accurate - personally , I can't say whether it is or not , since I don't know much about the situation it follows ; but I do know that the film continually achieves it's aim of thrilling the audience , and that's what is most important from my point of view . The film apparently bombed at the box office ; and that's hardly surprising , as French history isn't a big point of interest for many other countries - and the fact that it stars an unknown actor in the lead role ensures that the film was on the back foot from the beginning . However , audiences back in 1973 don't know what they were missing - as thrillers don't come much more assured and classy than this one ! The film follows the French Foreign Legion as they hire a professional assassin to dispose of the president . We then follow said professional , as well as a French detective as it counts down to the supposed day of the president's death . This is something of an odd thriller , as director Fred Zinnemann continually keeps the action relaxed and there is no music score ; or obvious attempts to build tension . All the suspense flows from the central plot , and by keeping everything relaxed - the film has a ' calm before the storm ' atmosphere throughout , which serves both in being foreboding and ensuring that the audience always wants to know what's going to happen next . Zinnemann hardly shows the target upon which the whole movie revolves around - namely , President de Gaulle , and this is of benefit to the film as it means that the action can focus on the more important plot threads of the assassin and the detective . The acting is good throughout , with unknown actor Edward Fox doing well in providing a frighteningly incognito performance as the Jackal . The plotting is good also , and Kenneth Ross ' screenplay is perfectly pitched in providing thrills , as well as focusing on the implication of the plot itself . Overall , this is a finely tuned and classy little thriller and one that should not be missed by anyone that calls themselves a film fan !
423447	2248099	39536	9.0	A fabulously dark and brooding noir !	Film noir is one of my favourite types of cinema , and Kiss of Death is easily one of the best that I've seen . The film benefits from all the familiar noir elements ; such as a dark and brooding atmosphere , a conflicted lead character and a very dastardly villain . The plot is the film's key element , as it manages to thrill , enthral and make its audience think at the same time . The film takes in common noir elements such as jail time , revenge and doing what you have to do and winds it tightly around the story of one man . Nick Bianco is still suffering from the jail time he did as a youngster and can't get himself a job . So , robbing a jewellery store seems to be the answer ; only that plan turns awry when Nick is caught and thrown in jail . He's given the chance to rat out his associates in return for a relaxed sentence , but Nick refuses . Soon after , however , Nick learns that his wife has committed suicide , leaving his two daughters to live in an orphanage . He soon decides to take the offer of ratting on his friends in order to get himself out , and it's not long before Nick finds himself falling foul of psychotic gangster Tommy Udo . . . Richard Widmark would , of course , go on to feature in many great noir films ; and it's not hard to see why after his debut performance here . Despite not having a lot of screen time , Widmark dominates the film as Tommy Udo and takes a lot of thunder away from the star of the show , Victor Mature . That's not to say that Mature doesn't put in a decent ( if a little flat ) performance as the unfortunate lead , but he's easy to ignore every time Widmark shares the screen with him . The scene that Kiss of Death is most notorious for sees Widmark pushing a wheelchair-bound woman down the stairs . Said scene is the standout of the movie , and really gives the film reason to remember it for . Henry Hathaway takes the director's chair and does an excellent job with it . Kiss of Death isn't Hathaway's first noir and it seems he has learned from previous films as he instils this one with a fascinating gloomy atmosphere and ensures that the film delivers the thrills in all the right places . On the whole , Kiss of Death is a genre film that definitely deserves the accolade ' must see ' , and I wouldn't hesitate to list this among more esteemed classics . Highly recommended .
423256	2248099	57128	9.0	Absolutely wonderful	Roger Corman's ' Poe ' series is one of the all time highlights of cinema . With low budgets , great stories and Vincent Price ; Corman has created a legacy that is hard to react to with anything but admiration , and it's certainly a style of film-making that will never be utilised again . This film is , actually , not based on a story by Edgar Allen Poe ; but one by the almost equally excellent HP Lovecraft . You will notice Poe's name on the posters , but that's nothing more than a ploy by American International to ensure that people went to see it . However , whoever wrote it is inconsequential , because it's incredible whatever . From the moment it begins , with an incredibly malevolent Vincent Price being burned for witchcraft shortly after putting a curse on the village of Arkham in one of the man's finest monologues ever ; this film grabs you doesn't let go until the words ' The End ' appear on your screen . The subject of witchcraft and burning witches has , and will always be absolutely fascinating and this film capitalises on that . Adding to the intrigue is some otherworldly creatures in the basement that Price feeds young women to , and a village full of deformed residents ! Lovecraft's Necronomicon joins the party as well . . . I don't know how much American International paid Vincent Price for making this and other Corman films , but whatever it was , it wasn't enough . Price holds the viewer's attention like no other actor has ever , and probably will ever do again . He handles his dual role fantastically , and switches between the darkly macabre and an innocent naivety at the drop of a hat . Also joining in the fun is fellow horror legend , Lon Chaney ; who puts in a delightful performance and provides most of the scares ! Corman does an absolutely fantastic job of building atmosphere in this movie , and the village of Arkham is constantly foreboding and intriguing . The use of smoke is right on cue ; as is the music , which is massively over the top ; but very , very effective . The problem with many horror films is that in spite of being excellent , they're often not very frightening ; but there's one sequence in this film that sees a bunch of deformed villagers surround Price and his wife that is positively nightmare inducing ! I have nothing but respect and admiration for this picture as it is an immense achievement in Corman's Poe cycle , and don't let the fact that it's not a Poe story put you off - if you're a fan of Price , Corman or just low budget atmospheric horror in general , see this film NOW !
422700	2248099	66040	9.0	The evil that young Catholic girls do !	It's quite unbelievable that this film doesn't have a better reputation , as Joël Séria's Don't Deliver Us From Evil is an intricately worked little shocker that is sure to appeal to fans of European cinema . It's clear that the film was made in France , as the plotting , style and atmosphere of the movie is very French indeed , and this benefits the movie as it wallows in the imperfections of its lead characters ; two sexy , yet underage convent school girls that decide to forsake God and take sides with The Devil . Both characters clearly have the urge to do evil already in them , but the way that director Joël Séria coaxes them into committing sinful acts is good because the characters are easy to care for ; but their acts make them easy to detest ; and as we all know - God hates the sin , not the sinner . The themes of straying from the moral acts that we've all been taught since birth shine through well , as the pair at the centre of the story are completely angelic , and on the face of it ; look like butter wouldn't melt in their mouths . It can be said that the actual plotting isn't all that shocking ; but everything in the film is made more so by the fact that it's stars are so young . The ' evil ' that the young girls do involves reading forbidden material at first , and eventually moves on to teasing men , arson and murdering people's pets . Joël Séria doesn't shy away from featuring nudity in the film ; and the pair of scenes that handle attempted rape don't leave much to the imagination . Don't Deliver Us From Evil benefits from a pair of great performances from young French actresses Jeanne Goupil and Catherine Wagener . Both give the film their all and give mature portrayals of their characters . The film is said to be a horror film ; but it isn't really the case , as the focus is more on the drama and the corruption of youth than the satanic themes . The director doesn't allow the film to descend into comic book styling's , like some other films handling Satan do ; and this benefits the film as it always seems serious and mature . Don't Deliver Us From Evil ( great title , by the way ! ) is not as shocking now as it would have been upon it's release in 1970 - but still the film holds some weight in the shock stakes as many of the ideas that it portrays are still taboo to this day . Overall , this is a fascinating watch and one that should be seen by anyone who has a chance to see it !
423502	2248099	74806	9.0	Intriguing , macabre and brilliantly acted - a must see film !	Wow , where has this little flick been ? The Little Girl who Lives Down the Lane is an intriguing mystery , an intense character portrait and a dark , brooding thriller all rolled into one rather odd little package - and on a personal note , I liked it a lot ! The film has gained some notoriety ( although not as much as it would have if it was more seen ) for the scene involving a thirteen year old Jodie Foster undressing - but that never offsets the point of the film , and besides that ; it's hardly like the scene has just been thrown in to satisfy the perverts in the audience . Furthermore , the most shocking scene in the film involves a hamster with no naked teenage girl present ! Anyway , The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane is about a young girl , living down a quiet lane with her poet father . Only nobody has ever this man , and it isn't long before nosey neighbours - such as the perverted Frank Hallet and his enquiring , power mad mother comes sniffing round , eager to upset her life . She's not quick to let them know the truth , however , and along with her boyfriend ; a crippled young magician from the neighbourhood , she is forced to take steps to preserve her independence . The most obvious theme running through the film stems from loneliness , and how being brought up on your own will ultimately leave you a different person to if things such as schools are allowed to take charge . This is interesting ; as it preaches the idea of social conditioning makes up the person more than most like to admit . The film is often touted as being a horror , but this is incorrect . While the film does feature several macabre instances , and a foreboding and mysterious atmosphere that is present throughout the run time ; there's very little in the way of actual horror . The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane is much more of a drama-come-mystery than a horror film . The film is probably most notable for it's lead performance . Jodie Foster had already impressed in 1976 with her role in Martin Scorsese's hit film , Taxi Driver - but here she is far better . Despite her young age , Foster commands the screen and despite being a child , her maturity and acting talent shine through to make this a more complete performance than most actresses manage in a lifetime . On the whole , this film was once hard to come by ; but with the new DVD currently doing the rounds , the film should be seen by everyone . The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane fits snugly alongside the rest of the classics of the seventies , and the fact that it has only just resurfaced is one of cinema's biggest injustices . Highly recommended viewing !
421779	2248099	36244	9.0	Brilliant and timeless ensemble drama	The Ox-Bow Incident isn't a very well known cinema classic , and therefore it's fan base is comprised mostly of cinema buffs that are willing to go that extra mile to see great films . It's a shame that this film hasn't managed to cement itself better in cinema history since it's release in 1943 , but on the other hand ; anyone who does make the effort to seek it out is definitely in for a treat ! Unlike many other westerns from the golden age of cinema , this one doesn't focus on Cowboys and Indians or other such entertainment friendly subjects , but instead the story is of a much more absorbing and long-lasting nature . The implications of this film can be applied to almost any time in history and it will be relevant , and that is what makes The Ox-Bow Incident such a great film . The story follows two drifters who ride into a town to find that the locals are forming a posse to catch and hang the men that they believe have murdered a local farmer and stolen his cattle . It quickly becomes apparent that the men accused may not be guilty , but the townsfolk are bloodthirsty and hungry to see justice done there and then . The themes in the film are more prevalent and important than the plot itself . The film shows how rash decisions can out-shadow the truth , and this story can be likened to any number of stories over the last few centuries where the American value of ' innocent until proved guilty ' has been overshadowed in favour of a crowd-pleasing decision . The tragedy of the film is always at the forefront , and this makes it difficult to aptly categorise this film as a western . Putting this film in with a genre of film that often focuses on gunfights and chase sequences somehow doesn't seem right . This film is really an ensemble drama , and in just a 72 minute running time , director William A . Wellman has managed to make a film that both intrigues and gives it's audience food for thought . Too many filmmakers these days think that a long running time is what makes a great film ; but Wellman has proved that tight plotting and an important story are the far more important aspects . Henry Fonda is the biggest name on the cast list , and he does well ; but even he struggles to shine amongst this film's real star , which is , of course , the script and the themes on offer . On the whole , this is a great film , which deserves more respect and shouldn't be missed by anyone !
422400	2248099	335345	9.0	Visually stunning and amazingly powerful	Whoever or wherever you are is irrelevant ; you have heard something about this film . The controversy that The Passion of the Christ has garnered is phenomenal , so much so that it has eclipsed the movie itself . However , unlike a lot of movies with heaps of controversy surrounding it's release ; The Passion of the Christ has a great movie to back up it's bite with . As you know , the film's plot revolves around the final hours of Jesus Christ's existence on this earth . This is a story that needs to be told ; Jesus is one of the most important and most talked about people to ever live , and the events surrounding his death are massively important to both history and religion . I don't know how close this movie has stayed to actual events , because I wasn't there ; but I do know that it feels very real . Mel Gibson does a great job of making us believe that we are indeed in the year of Jesus ' crucifixion , and overall realism is one of the film's key assets . It needs to be , of course , as the film would have been worthless if it didn't get that part right . Worthless is something that The Passion of the Christ most certainly isn't ; and that is something that anyone watching the scenes in which this film gained notoriety for - the torture scenes , will be able to see . I'm not religious myself , to me Jesus is nothing more than any other historical figure ; but it is impossible to deny the power of these scenes . Many film fans have condemned Mel Gibson for showing such grotesque violence being committed on Jesus Christ , but on the contrary ; I think that Mel was right to do so . Providing that what is depicted in the bible is true ( . . . ) , Jesus was indeed brutally beaten ; so had Mel not have shown it , he wouldn't have been telling the story . Of course , some people would still say that the violence is over the top ; but had any of it have been cut out , then the film would have lost some of it's power . It needs the shot of the hooks tearing away at Jesus ' flesh to emphasize the brutality of the beating . It is also worth noting that although the violence is extreme , it's never perverse . We are with Jesus at all times , and are never made to feel delight at seeing him being brutally tortured . Throughout the film , we are with Jesus ; we feel his pain and had these scenes have been toned down , the movie's power would not have been nearly what it was . I'm a man that enjoys seeing people being beaten in movies , and as mentioned , I'm not religious either ; but even I was repulsed and disgusted by the events depicted here . Personally I don't think that criticising the movie for being violent is a worthy criticism . The film , in many ways , feels like a horror movie . Obviously the brutal beating is the main case in point , but also adding weight to this claim is the malevolent way that the devil ( which is one of the best devil's I've ever seen in a movie ) malevolently stalks various scenes , and the entire first sequence of the movie . That is a great sequence by the way ; it's drenched in a blue-green tone , and coupled with the images of devil makes for a very eerie sequence indeed . The movie is packed with great visuals , the devil being just one of them ; overall , it's a visual treat . Technically , the film is almost perfect . As I mentioned ; it's very believable . Aside from Jim Caviezel and Monica Bellucci , the cast is almost totally made up of unknowns ; and every single one excels . There's not a single person in the film that looks lost or out of place , and there's not many movies that you can say that for . One of the finest aspects of this movie is the score . It's amazing , quite frankly . Every single note is right on time , and The Passion of the Christ is one of the best examples of a movie that is made much more powerful by it's score . Without it's music , The Passion of the Christ would not grab the viewer even nearly as much as it does . Mel Gibson is a man that I've never liked . For such a big star , I could never get over the fact that he'd never made a good movie . That's all changed now of course , although I still don't like him ; but I have to hand it to him here , as he's made a very good movie . His decision to film the movie in Aramaic , Latin and Hebrew as opposed to the more user-friendly English annoyed me at first , however I do now find myself agreeing with Gibson's decision . The fact that the movie is in subtitles immensely adds to the realism , and although I do think that this movie would still have been great had it have been filmed in English , I'm no longer opposed to the subtitles . Mel Gibson was very bold in releasing this movie , and that is something that one has to admire him for . It is not an easy thing to do something that people are likely to look down upon , but Mel Gibson overcame opposition to bring this movie to the screen , and not only this ; but he has brought it to the screen extremely well . Because of the fact that Gibson has obviously made the movie how he wanted it ; we haven't had to suffer any of the usual Hollywood commodities , and what we have instead is an honest and unique piece of cinema . Kudos to Mel Gibson for giving us that . The Passion of the Christ is a film that is never going to be universally accepted as a great film , nothing this controversial ever will . Before seeing it , I was under the impression that it would not live up to its hype , and I almost didn't see it for this reason . However , the movie has not only lived up to its hype but surpassed it . Even if the film doesn't grab you , it is a movie that simply needs to be experienced by everyone , as there simply isn't anything else quite like it . Don't make the mistake I almost did . Just one thing though . . . I've never crucified anyone before but I think you'll find , Mel , that the nails go through the wrist .
421782	2248099	36613	10.0	A fiendishly good time - a masterpiece of black comedy !	The phrase " they don't make ' em like this any more " must have been thought up with this film in mind . Arsenic and Old Lace is a comedy the likes of which could only have been made before cinema audiences became as jaded as they are now . The comedy is pitch black - but it's pitch black in a nice humour sort of a way . These days , too many filmmakers seem to think that black comedy has to be really dark - but Frank Capra knew it doesn't , and this movie is the result . Here , we have a film that follows themes of poisoning , crime and insanity , but it's so fun to watch that you don't realise just how macabre the plot is . The whole film is played out with a great big smile on it's face - and although the plot just continues to get more and more complicated as the film progresses - the audience doesn't notice because it's so fun to watch . We follow Mortimer Brewster , a critic who , on his wedding day , finds out that his kindly old aunts are really homicidal maniacs that have killed twelve gentlemen already . One of his brothers thinks he's Teddy Roosevelt , and the other is a wanted criminal with a strange likeness to Boris Karloff . . . as Mortimer himself says , insanity doesn't run in his family - it practically gallops ! The whole film is held together courtesy of a maestro performance from Cary Grant . Grant is an absolutely superb actor , and every single scene with him in is just mesmerising . The one where he finds out that his aunts have killed the man in the window box is one of the best Cary ever did . The way that he commands the screen is awesome and I really can't lump enough praise on this great , great actor ! He is joined by a whole host of weird and wonderful characters . The fact that all these characters are in the film gives it free reign to basically do whatever it wants . The plot is easy to follow because the characters are so unique from one another , and really ; they could all be just standing around watching paint dry and it would be funny ! Speaking of the word ' funny ' - this film epitomises it ! Arsenic and Old Lace doesn't suffer from a single dull moment , and you could laugh at practically any moment in the film and you wouldn't be laughing at nothing . Many people think that great classics need substance to be remembered - but this one proves otherwise . Arsenic and Old Lace is a good time , plain and simple - and yet there's nobody that can argue that this isn't a masterpiece . See this film !
422465	2248099	157044	10.0	In a word : brilliant	François Ozon's pitch black mickey take is a biting satire on family life and a brash distraction from the shows of it's title . While many sitcom's are monotonous affairs , Ozon's take on the medium is anything but . Despite taking in many of the clichés of the sitcom - stuffy mother , raunchy maid , bored father etc - Sitcom manages to be continually inventive and the way that it exposes the clichés of the genre is both ludicrously ridiculous and harshly disturbing . The French director proves with this movie that he's not afraid to overstep several boundaries and make a film that dares to be different , and for that reason this film will never be universally liked . However , if you can connect with Ozon's vision , you're in for a treat and that was the situation I found myself in ! The story follows a father who , after bringing his family a lab-rat for a present , finds his family collapsing around him - his son discovers he's gay , his daughter jumps out of the window and his wife . . . well , I'll leave you to find that out on your own . Sitcom is a singularly unpleasant experience . Watching family life deteriorate is a much more gruelling affair than you might imagine , and even though the family and the situation that Ozon has presented are utterly ridiculous ; he still manages to inject life into it , which ensures that it hammers home the point that the auteur intended . Whenever I see a film that dares to be different and deliver something that I haven't seen before , I tend to find myself heaping the praise on it and that is certainly the case with this film . You will not find a comedy with a more rotten core than this one and similarly you will not find one that dares to present the utterly ridiculous happenings that this movie thrives on . I don't know how Ozon thought he could get away with some of the things in this film - not just the taboo's he's portrayed , but other things too , some of which are just too stupid to comprehend ? but Ozon makes them work ! Sitcom is a movie that needs to be experienced , and it's a film that will divide opinions as much as any other movie ever made . And if only for that reason - see this film as soon as possible .
