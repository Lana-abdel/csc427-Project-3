583810	1219578	204626	1.0	Botched job	Dog food . Everything sucks in this so-called movie : a screenplay so hackneyed the average viewer must have seen the story a hundred times or more , flashy directing , poor acting from the leads , poor-as usual - female part whose only raison d'être is screaming . James Spader's wooden acting is absolutely awful . At the beginning of the movie , he's a deeply depressed man , living on acebutolol , seconal , you name it , unable to find the way back home ( that's what he says to his analyst ) and the following day , he turns into a dashing , dynamic elegant cop . As far the analyst is concerned , her only purpose is to provide the movie with an " intellectual " side . Keanu Reeves is totally unconvincing as the villain , , particularly when he " dances " . Some would be terrifying scenes look like spoofs on thrillers . Do not watch !
583754	1219578	183142	1.0	It has to be seen to be believed ( 2 )	I used the same title for " Broceliande " which took the horrror film to new heights of stupidity . This is the worst French ( and arguably Polish ? I cannot judge for that matter ) thriller that has ever been filmed to date , even beating the worst photocopies of " silence of the lambs " the likes of " les rivières pourpres " or " les morsures de l'aube " . It's a shame to take such a serious subject ( snuff movies ) and give it such a couldn't-care - less treatment . It's mindless and irresponsible to turn something unbearable into a pure entertainment movie . Alejandro Amenabar , when he made his highly superior " Tesis " did not fall into this trap ! Even " 8mm " ( with Nicholas Cage ) is a masterpiece compared to this piece of trash . The cast is abysmal ; the two cops are ridiculous : one of them is supposed to provide the movie with a comic relief but we do not even know which one ; the muscle man , who is supposed to be the hero-with-a - painful - past is perhaps worse than his so-called comic partner who treats ( sic ) whores as princesses and princesses as whores . Poland has got to find another country to team up with if they wanttheir cinema to gain a huge international audience . Why not Spain ?
582330	1219578	60561	1.0	Abysmal	" Joe Caligula " was reportedly forbidden by the censorship at the same time as Jacques Rivette's " la religieuse ' , but not for the same reasons . " Joe Caligula " anticipated Quarantino's extreme violence by more than thirty years . That does not make it a good movie for all that , by a long shot . It is actually one of the worst French duds I have ever seen . The credits go as far as claiming this : If John Ford is Homer ( why not after all ? the great director compares favorably with the Greek poet ) , then José Bénazéraf is . . . . . ( you'll never guess it ) Marcel Proust . Well , if it is so , then Ed Wood is Shakespeare . Bénazéraf is known ( but only by people who like that kind of stuff ) for his porno movies which were to follow in the wake of " Joe " : many scenes of this movie verge on porno anyway : strip tease , nude women in bed . . . Well if Howard Hawks depicted Scarface as some kind of Borgia , why not Caligula for a young crook ? The problem lies in the fact that Joe has absolutely nothing to do with the Roman emperor . Played by the late Gérard Blain , who was a commendable actor when there was a Duvivier , a Chabrol or a Wenders to direct him , but here sank without a trace . Ditto for Ginette Leclerc , who was formerly directed by Pagnol , Clouzot and Duvivier ! The rest of the cast is zombie-like , particularly the female lead Jeanne Valérie . The script is so dismal that the actors often repeat their lines twice , five times and even more ! When the starlet in tears tells the story of her lover ( or husband who cares ) who was burnt alive ( and is still burning , she points out ) , it is unintentionally highly comic . The story ? well I shall now come to the question : Bénazéraf pits Joe and his young pack against a bunch of " old " gangsters and their molls . There's no more to say . That such a turkey can be mentioned in " Guide des Films " , the Bible of the French cine buff ( and granted one star at that ! ) is beyond me .
584215	1219578	185183	1.0	Oh my God ! They ( John Travolta and Roger Christian ) killed science-fiction !	In the world of the cinema , there's one thing I don't understand and that I find mysterious : how with a pharaonic budget can we produce such appalling movies ? Roger Christian should have thought about it before he began shooting his film . He even should have given up his project . An important amount of money would have been saved . The place of " Battlefield Earth " in the top of the worst movies in IMDB is absolutely justified . This film's got every conceivable fault , every imaginable fault so that you can name it : the perfect load of rubbish : a stupid script full of flaws , rotten special effects , ludicrous actors , beginning with John Travolta . It's so overwhelmed with mediocrity that you quickly get tired of an extremely manichean plot . Nothing can be saved from a movie which is quite similar to " Planet of the apes " ( 1968 ) by Franklin Schaffner . The worst movie made in 2000 . TO AVOID !
582363	1219578	69369	1.0	Avant-garde ? Isn't it the French word for c . . . ?	That's what John Lennon once said . Themroc is would be avant-garde , but only for these who have a short memory . Take the beginning of the movie : these herds going to work , the hero's tiny and seedy flat , they already were in King Vidor's " the crowd " ( 1928 ) . Actually Claude Faraldo contents himself with recycling the most dated clichés of the post May 68 era : down with the bosses , power to the people , kill ( and eat ) the cops , this is a brand new life , opportunity knocks , make love not war , we are the good guys , the others are the villains , please get out of the new road if you can't lend a hand , and so on . Spitting on the cops was so à la mode that Faraldo could not be wrong while speaking to the intellectual post 68 elite : humble people are actually demeaned in his film . How to attract people's attention ? Which form should he use ? That's Faraldo's lucky break ! No form at all , a formless product . So it seems that he has filmed haphazardly , then asked his editor to work in a " surrealistic " way ( He was not aware that Luis Bunuel had already done that , as far as editing is concerned - un chien andalou ( 1928 ) l'âge d'or ( 1930 ) ; his movies were as subversive as Faraldo's , and at a time when it was not that much trendy . Bunuel wasn't born to follow ) . People who like this - and they seem to be quite a lot - should catch Jacques Doillon ' s " l'an 01 " , which deals with the same clichés , but which is less pretentious : it could be , relatively speaking , a seventies update of Jean Renoir's " la vie est à nous " ( 1936 ) .
583021	1219578	42911	1.0	Worst French movie of all time ?	This one is a strong contender . It was based on a comic strip which everyone has forgotten today . I've never read it , but if it is as subtle as the film , I do not miss an awful lot . The main reason for which this flick is sought is Louis de Funes ' s presence : he portrays a violin teacher with a very long beard ( which predates Rabbi Jacob ? ) . The rest consists of grotesque gags , lines for mentally retarded persons , vulgar jokes . I dare you to watch this dud till the end . I called it quits halfway through . This is the only feature film by Marcel Gibaud whose shorts , they say , are interesting .
584146	1219578	143944	1.0	Maffia and melodrama .	This movie is a jumble , a dreadful pot-pourri of incompetent playing ( Béatrice Dalle , in a pointless part ) , writing ( as many plot holes as in Swiss cheese ) and scoring ( syrupy strings , angelic hymns or Italian solo singer ) . The only reason to watch this movie is Raf Vallone's performance . He is no longer the handsome man he used to be but he retains charisma , humor and mischievousness . The maffia stuff has become a hackneyed topic nowadays . It's not the final melodramatic coup de théâtre ( predictable anyway ) that can save such a " déjà vu " story . Do not mistake this 1999 movie for the eponymous Jean Renoir classic ( 1934 ) ; and , no , it's not a remake .
584545	1219578	228418	1.0	Those were the days	This is exactly the kind of movie the Nouvelle Vague made possible . Probably inspired by some aspects of Godard's notorious " Masculin / Feminin " , it represents all that I hate in the French cinema . Probably inspired by real-life " teenage idols " , these three pitiful " singers " make the viewer turn a deaf ear to the music they play and sing ( which is some kind of parboiled cross between a poor man's Velvet Underground - and I like this group - and histrionic vocals ) . To be successful , such a movie demands precision - what the Rutles did with the Beatles , for instance - , a great sense of humor , a rebellious mind devoid of clichés ( the only moment that politically succeeds is Charlie's problems with the draft ; during those precious minutes , I did think the movie was going somewhere ) . The French " teenage idols " period was the early sixties . The 1962-1965 was the " yeah yeah " boys and girls heyday . Although some of them survived , from 1966 onwards , some real artists ( Jacques Dutronc , Julien Clerc , Michel Polnareff ) began to emerge . Charlie is a distant relative of Johnny Halliday , but Gigi does not look like France Gall , Serge Gainsbourg's Lolita . And it's an insult to mention the Beatles as far as Simon is concerned . There is also a hint at " Soeur Sourire " , who hit the US charts as " the singing nun " in 1964 . Proof positive that the story belongs to the first half of the sixties . All the actors overplay . Pierre Clementi could have been a good thespian , had he had more Bunuel and Deville ( and less so - called avant-garde ) ; Bulle Ogier is , depending on whom you ask , either sublime or atrociously unbearable , some kind of female Jean-Pierre Leaud . Jean-Pierre Kalfon is more restrained , be he blessed just for that . Les Idoles : a relic , a failed spoof ; take Watkins's " Privilège " instead .
584317	1219578	228569	1.0	Trash trash trash	Charley Boorman , who plays the villain ( and I mean villain ) , is John Boorman's son , but it is a far cry from " Esmerald forest " ! A trashy movie dealing with trash ! This is the kind of movie which should be burned . In the Middle Ages , the " director " , Jean Claude Roy ( who essentially made porno movies ) , would have been put in the stocks . " Massacres " deals with the awful subject of snuff movies . Although many characters are French ( as Roy is himself ) , the action takes place in Korea ( of course such things could not happen in a civilized country such as Roy's homeland ) . The filmed deaths make the viewer a peeping tom although the directing is so dismal it looks like a farce ( which it is not ) as three hooded men rush towards the victim . In Korea , French ( ? ) police captain ( the late Pierre Clementi : how could a man who worked with Luis Bunuel - " Belle de Jour " - have sunk so low ? ) and his men shoot without warning ! Rest in peace , counterfeiters ! Up comes a bubble head journalist moaning : " I do not approve of your methods , captain " . Sweet litotes ! Deserves to be part of the bottom 100 of French movies .
584798	1219578	73155	1.0	The most overrated French movie of all time ?	This one is a strong contender ! Romy Schneider was highly praised ( and granted a Cesar ) for her " harrowing " part but Zulawski is definitely a deeply boring terribly pretentious director . Outside Schneider , the casts includes zombie Dutronc who portrays a totally unconvincing character with suicidal tendencies and Fabio Testi , one of the worst Italian actors . The plot is very trite but it is given a " meaningful " " intellectual " treatment whose purpose is to make the audience feel they have watched an " important " work . Nadine Chevalier was Schneider's answer to those who thought she was still their Sissi . I'm not an intellectual : I like Sissi best .
584658	1219578	331468	2.0	There is not a single scene . . . .	. . . . that the average viewer has not seen at least ten times or more . You can see what the characters are up to next from a mile off . A nice family ( Quaid , Stone , and two lovable children ) buys a manor in ruins in order to shun the traffic , pollution and problems of the big apple . But alas the former owner of this once desirable property ( Dorf ) is not prepared to accept it . Shall I tell more ? The horrible scenesare laughable at best , particularly when the house is alive with snakes . Juliette Lewis , a very gifted actress , is wasted , which is a shame ! The screenwriter is also the producer : that must be the reason why such a lousy story was filmed . Mike Figgis had done commendable works before : " internal affairs " starring Andy Garcia notably .
583726	1219578	103153	3.0	Bourgeois cinema .	It looks like Claude Sautet's seventies movies . This film takes no chance , raises no question does not charm or repel . The eternal love triangle . An actress ( without roles ) married with a wealthy antique dealer falls from a younger man . What shall she do ? Well do not bother . The three of them have no problems to make ends meet . The triteness of the screenplay is so glaring it's extraordinary that the director could find a producer . François Dupeyron would show more ambition afterward : his fantasy effort " la machine " which featured Gérard Depardieu and Natalie Baye was certainly underrated ( in its own way , it predated " Face / Off " ! ) . And he finally gave his best film with " la Chambre des Officiers "
582842	1219578	116432	3.0	Why did we tell Jacques Villeret that he'd be the golden boy ?	A film whose topic is one of the western society's major problems : unemployment , " Golden Boy " evokes the French populist cinema of the thirties . Moreover , several sides of the story show that the movie is very influenced by Frank Capra's works . Unfortunately Jean-Pierre Vergne's movie can't hold a candle to any of Capra's movies . The three most obvious adjectives to qualify this movie are : labored , dull and above all flat . The movie exudes a nice and harmless comic but it seriously lacks of cutting . Then , a nonexistent and listless directing , several hackneyed or predictable situations , a poor script don't help matters . All these factors can explain the commercial and critical failure of this movie when it was released in 1996 . At last , even Jacques Villeret who is however one of the finest comic actors that French cinema gave us can't save this firm ( you said it ) from mediocrity .
582535	1219578	143337	3.0	mediocre B thriller	The year before " les Kidnappeurs " ( 1998 ) opened in France , Graham Guit had signed a tight and dry B whodunit with a dash of humor : " le Ciel est à Nous " ( 1997 ) . Its model in the form and the content was the violent and bloody universe of Quentin Tarantino . One year later , hiring the same crew , he did it again with " les Kidnappeurs " , obviously an endeavor to produce a new little worked up whodunit in the same vein as its predecessor . Alas , it's a let-down which isn't up to scratch with " le Ciel est à Nous " and has virtually nothing commendable . There have been harsh words about Guit's effort and rightly so . It fails to be exciting albeit the onset starts under auspicious skies . As a matter of fact , the whole interest of the film remains confined in the outset with this astute idea : how Ulysse reveals to his accomplices how it is possible to simply succeed the burglary without danger and to pocket the loot . But as the average viewer can guess , it's too good to be true since in reality , the operation will go awry and the loot will be rubbish . It's the only watchable part of the flick and the job must be done under Freddy's orders . Alas , after the first meeting of the gang with him , it's downhill and it seems that Guit has left the building . The rest of the film consists of complex filler and its desultory character is revealed in all its splendor . Various inexplicable twists , complications and muddle clutter a screenplay written besides in a snap manner without altering and more serious without any attempt to clarify it . The director doesn't bother for his job and shelved a crucial premise of the cinema : a film is a sort of communicative link between its author and the viewer . But here , by delivering a story which is hard to decipher , Guit shows no respect for the audience . As he botches his job with his couldn't-care-less directing , it doesn't help his actors who do what they can to save the film from wreckage although it is doomed to failure . Too bad for young interprets like Elodie Bouchez or Melvil Poupaud who made the mistake to get themselves embroiled in this dud . Isaac Sharry makes his part count early in the story but then it becomes uninteresting . Romain Duris stands out as the lousy baddie with an IQ close to zero but one prefers him when he teams up with Cedric Klapisch . It even seems that the cast , by moments prefers to enjoy sunny landscapes . Loose : it's the most suitable adjective to qualify Guit's piece of work who neglected to include stringent in his mind when he wrote the film . A hash of money as well as a waste of film both for the actors and the audience . Take " le Ciel est à Nous " instead . NB : Elie Kakou dies at the end of the film , a sinister omen when one knows that he died of a cancer the following year in 1999 . . .
583451	1219578	289848	3.0	mafia blues 2 : the relapse	Harold Ramis seems to have found his bearings in American comedy through the repetition . In Groundhog Day ( 1993 ) , he condemned Bill Murray to live the same day over and over again . In " Multiplicity " ( 1996 ) , he gave Michael Keaton the opportunity to clone himself in four different characters . Here , for the third time in his career , the repetition strikes again . " Analyze This " was a big success in 1999 and a sequel was likely to be awaited . But this follow-up mainly obeys to a commercial logic . Quite obviously , Ramis wanted to use the recipes again that made the success of the first movie . As we say : it's always the same old people . . . for a rather unexciting film ! I watched " Analyze This " during a flight for Canada in 1999 and I thought it wasn't too bad but not memorable . What did I think of " Analyze That " ? I quite hated it . The duo Robert De Niro / Billy Crystal is rather exhilarating and their scathing confrontations are running well . Besides , the director offers De Niro the opportunity to make fun of the type of character he acted in " The Godfather " ( 1972 ) or " Goodfellas " ( 1990 ) . On another hand , it is true that the movie takes off in the moments when the two protagonists are in identity crisis . For the rest , sorry Mr Ramis but I can't accept so much vulgarity in the dialogs , so much ponderousness in the style and so much inconsistence in the screenplay ( it is difficult to imagine De Niro looking for a job on Crystal's advice because he acts a character with a limited IQ ) . Moreover , the plot ( if there is one ! ) tends to fray and as soon as De Niro is hired as an adviser in dialogs for a television series , the rest of the film is just padding , notably when we arrive at the stickup sequence . Be that as it may , if you liked the first movie very much , " Analyze That " will please you . As for the others , to approach with caution .
584838	1219578	115798	3.0	the cable guy , he only wants to embrace your life and to be your friend forever	20 000 000 millions of dollars . Jim Carrey asked this substantial amount to hold this miscast role for him . This Pharaonic amount of money is just as equal as his overwhelming presence in " the Cable Guy " ( 1996 ) . If he tries to renew his image by acting another type of character who is a disturbing psychopath ( a will already contemplated with the rather poor " Batman Forever " 1995 ) , on the other hand , his acting hasn't changed : still bombastic with grimaces and frenzied gestures by the bucketful . Beside him , it's hard for Matthew Broderick to play opposite him . As for the rest of the cast , its members are relegated to the roles of walk-on parts . It's a shame because if the basic idea isn't new ( we have seen the topic of the disturbing character invades a peaceful universe many times before in the cinema and in a better treatment ) , Stiller's making is more careful and vigilant than in his " Zoolander " ( 2001 ) flick . Sometimes , he succeeds in exuding a grain of madness which gives the whole , for a while a mad tone ( the scene of the restaurant ) . Moreover , the satire is well present even if it is excessive due to the numerous targets : consumer society , television and computing overequipment . To sum up , " the Cable Guy " in spite of a decent making is mainly a flop because spoiled by Carrey's omnipresence who leaves bits to his partner . To crown it all , the latter asked a comfortable fee , the movie didn't prove very profitable . Carrey's fans must have said to themselves : " please Jim , don't change " !
584560	1219578	322289	3.0	Even the oysters are bad !	I've seen tons of Chabrol movies , about 95 % of his films and all I can see is that the proportion of duds increases in the years . Even directors deserve retirement ! The bourgeoisie dolce vita has been told told and TOLD by CC ! Enough ! I'm fed up ! It's all the more infuriating as earlier works had bite and guts going for them ( " que la bete meure " " la rupture " " la femme infidèle " ) when it wasn't pure genius ( " le boucher " ) . We feel now , and it's the last straw , a discreet charm of the bourgeoisie , he treats his bourgeois indulgently . The actors go from excellent ( veteran Suzanne Flon , in a part not worthy of herself ) to passable ( Baye is good enough in her " visiting the Poor " scenes , a pale reflection of his predecessor Claude Autant-Lara ' s " Douce " ( 1942 ) ) to dismal ( Bernard LeCoq , generally relegated to mediocre comedies , Benoit Magimel and his girlfriend - who might not or might be his cousin - ) Sign of the times : the gastronomy sequence which you can find in everything CC did , for the first time is a fiasco : the oysters , says bourgeois Magimel , are not what they used to be . If it were only the oysters . . . .
582975	1219578	42255	3.0	Jackstraw	Released at a time when Duvivier was going again from strength to strength . " Black Jack " which was sandwiched between the overlooked extraordinary " Au Royaume des Cieux " and the dazzling stunning " Sous Le Ciel de Paris " , is a jumble , which Duvivier himself hated , which is not surprising . There's almost nothing to write about this dud . We can notice that : 1 . Orson Welles used to admire Duvivier . That may explain why Wellesian actors were featured in Duvivier's movies : Joseph Cotten in " Lydia " ( 1941 ) , and here a totally wasted Agnes Moorehead . It's the first timeI have not enjoyed Moorehead's performance ! On the other hand , Welles borrowed his Desdemona ( Suzanne Cloutier ) from Duvivier's " Au Royaume des Cieux " for his " Othello " . 2 . In any Duvivier's movie , there's one or two worthwhile sequences and this one is no exception : the search in the caves where Duvivier's sense of mystery works wonders ( for a short while ) ; then the chase when Dalio gets caught up in the fishnets . Duvivier's touch can be felt in the unhappy end too . As for the rest , as my dear pen pal writer's reign writes , it's a black joke .
583767	1219578	448802	4.0	Where have you been , Anastasia ?	Do not let the title fool you . Even if there're murders in this movie , it's not that bloody . Actually , the film reminds me of one of Lautner's best films " La Maison Assassinée " ( 1988 ) . Unfortunately , Nicolas Guillou's screenplay is rather weak and the lines particularly mediocre . " La Maison Assassinée " continued an old French tradition : the " rural " thriller , which included such memorable works as " L'Assassinat Du Père Noel " ( 1941 ) , " Goupi Mains Rouges " ( 1942 ) or " La Ferme des Sept Péchés " ( 1949 . There was a revival of the genre , in the early seventies , with a more " realistic " approach : " La Horse " " La Veuve Couderc " . . . . " Terre de Sang " would rather be part of the early forties works with its " mysterious " atmosphere and its gallery of weirdos ; " Maison Assassinée " brilliantly succeeded in this vein . " Terre de Sand " does not : it is a patchy inconsistent work , in spite of good actors we rarely see nowadays : Dominique Paturel was famous in the late sixties for playing D'Artagnan in the eponymous miniseries ; Ginette Garcin would have been ideally cast too , had she been given decent material . A woman and her daughter died in a fire . . . . Twenty years later , a young woman comes back to the village , pretending she is the late child . . . It was a good idea , but it does not work .
583793	1219578	39234	4.0	The supervisor does not work wonders , neither does the film .	This movie features a bunch of children locked up in a reform school under a nasty headmaster's thumb ; then comes a very nice human supervisor played by Noël-Noël . And presto , the naughty brats become angels with golden voices who set up a choir , and the distinguished old ladies who visit the school are on cloud nine , well , you get the picture . First thing to bear in mind is that these children were professional singers : all of them were part of " les petits chanteurs à la croix de bois " ( the little singers with the wooden cross ) , so do not be fooled , the supervisor is not in any way responsible for their prowesses . Well the plot is not unlike " going my way " , except that the main actor is not a singer like Bing Crosby . This mushy weepie , which seems sometimes unbearable - but not more than , say , " dead poets society " - , is typical Occupation cinema , the likes of " le voile bleu " . It's a return to good old morality : individuality is condemned , everyone must be part of the group , the choir becoming a transparent metaphor . The ending in the church is almost sirkesque . Remade ( or almost ) as " les choristes "
584029	1219578	118158	4.0	You shall be a man my son .	At first sight , this is an entertaining movie . But what lies beneath is a very obnoxious moral , and the final lines on the screen before the final cast and credits are a dubious proof that this voyage made men of the youngsters . Far from his beautiful character of " fearless " , Bridges portrays here a macho man - he does not even share a tear for his wife , who does anyway ? - : the way Scott introduces him is , so to speak , worth the price of admission . This is the umpteenth version of " you shall be a man my son " in the grand tradition of " captain courageous " , but that was then and this is now , and time has taken its toll : such a manly story has become obsolete today . That said , the storm scene is wonderfully filmed , which is the least we can expect from Ridley Scott .
585192	1219578	47113	4.0	A brothel ? Really ?	Another movie about the white slave trade , a subject the French cinema was fond of : in the thirties Robert Siodmak made " Le Chemin De Rio " aka " Cargaison Blanche " . The working title of " Les Impures " was " Des Femmes Disparaissent " ( Women vanish ) and this title would be used for another movie about the same subject by Edouard Molinaro starring Robert Hossein in 1959 . That said , it's not good news : two excellent leads , Raymond Pellegrin and Micheline Presles are lost in a story unworthy of their talent . There are enormous gaffes : how can Michèle , who works in a nightclub as a chanteuse / Cancan dancer , be so naive ? How can she believe that her love " undergoes a period of training " ? . It depends on what kind of training it is , mind you . Many of the scenes are good for a laugh . Barely .
584046	1219578	58580	4.0	Quine and Wilder .	Richard Quine sems here to pay a tribute to Billy Wilder : " some like it hot " and Jack Lemmon are mentioned several times , and Tony Curtis ' presence is eloquent . But , by doing so , Quine recalls us the gulf between him and " the seven years itch " director . All what Quine says , Wilder has already said it , in such works as the two mentioned masterpieces . Just compare the ponderous " dirty paper " scenes of " sex . . " and the covers of the " dirty " covers of the books in " seven years itch " . Compare the endless and tiresome final to-ings and fro-ings of " sex . . . " ( tedious car chase ) with the stunning final chase - and I won't even compare the dialogs ; after all , nobody's perfect - in " some like it hot " . Assuming this to be the case , you can however find some pleasure in watching " sex . . . " , particularly in the first part , very " light comedy as performed in the theatres of the Paris Boulevards " , à la George Feydeau . The " babe shrink and hunk " scenes are often funny and Natalie Wood is hilarious when she says she's like Curtis ' father ! The mistakes ( " quiproquos " ) add fuel to the plot , when Wood is confronted with three Curtis ' wife . The pair Wood / Curtis operates well . But Laureen Bacall overacts and Henry Fonda is ill - at - ease in a comedy . I would like to point out Wilder's superiority over Quine . The latter stretches his gags till they become really heavy . ( for instance , the policeman who wants to arrest everybody ) , the former uses concision to a fault ( the final dialog between Lemmon and Brown in " some like it hot " ) . And , mainly there's a sense of madness in Wilder's work which Quine is unable to sustain .
584462	1219578	81339	4.0	When the actors overplay	Robert Enrico was at his best during the sixties , " les aventuriers " ( 1966 ) and " tante Zita " ( 1967 ) ; although deemed " commercial " at the time , these two works have something of a dirge . Actress Johanna Shimkus dies in the former - and her funeral under the sea is one of the most extraordinary sequence of the French cinema in the sixties - , and has to cope with her aunt's death in the latter . Both feature François de Roubaix's sublime scores . Afterwards , Enrico ' s career became eclectic and erratic : " ho " ( 1968 ) which featured Jean-Paul Belmondo and Shimkus again was clearly uninspired and " le boulevard du rhum " was not adequate a vehicle for Brigitte Bardot's career then on the wane . He won a cesar for " le vieux fusil " , but if the first third which enhances Romy Schneider's frail beauty is quite moving , what remains , the castle , complete with dungeons , secret passages and two-way mirrors , recalls Louis Feuillade's silent movies circa 1914 . " Pile ou face " recalls the worst Chabrol movies . Two stories intertwines and do not sustain interest : has a man ( Serrault ) killed his wife ? Who pulls the strings in a drug affair among the young men of means ? Robert Enrico , who directed the two great movies I mention at the beginning of my comment with taste and sensitiveness , has called it a day here . His two actors , Serrault and Noiret ( " le vieux fusil " hero ) , hog the stage and drown him out . Generally the French critics were laudatory as for their performances , but I find them boring and irritating : Noiret has never been so vulgar , he who can act with finesse . " Au nom de tous les miens " ( 1983 ) from Martin Gray did something to restore Enrico's reputation , but he never found back his state of grace of the mid-sixties .
583114	1219578	196420	4.0	it's nobody's fault !	" C'est pas ma faute " is just a gentle comedy where the actors do what they can to give it punch . But it turns out to be trite because it's a well-worn topic : a restless child who causes disasters everywhere he goes and they wish to get rid of him as soon as possible . Not only is it a gentle movie but for a major part , it falls into the conventional and leads to the inevitable " happy-end " . When Martin , the little boy is sliding away to take refuge in a big but frightening house , at first he's scared because this house is supposed to be haunted by a wicked man ( Jacques Perrin ) . Martin will realize that this man is nice and he had an unhappy life . He'll even be the one to find a way so as to solve the problem of an enormous tree fought between Martin's friends and a rival group . Anyway , it's too obvious that this movie is only aimed at children
583307	1219578	144084	4.0	John Cale imitates Herrmann .	I have always admired John Cale , as a former Velvet Underground member and as a solo artist . Here he gives us his Hermann act , and much of the score recalls the strident brilliance of " Psycho " , notably during the scene Bale joins the gay golden boy in the bathroom . Of course , it does not match Bernard Herrmann's magnum opus , but anyway who could surpass him ? MINOR SPOILER As for the movie , it's a pretty disappointing menu : Bale overplays and we've already seen that , much better , with Jack Nicholson . His character is obnoxious , a spoilt child ( don't we learn he was born silver spoon in hand , his father owning the company for which he " works " ? ) . There's the obligatory coup de théâtre ( à la " the sixth sense " or " fight club " ) : it's not what you thought it was . I begin to get tired of these " unexpected " endings . Dafoe , the beest actor of the movie is wasted with his part of an almost colomboesque detective .
585467	1219578	117468	4.0	Looks like a cartoon .	A cross between " time machine " ( at a small range ) " the groundhog day " and a road movie , " Retroactive " is not to be taken seriously ( ! ) . Belushi's acting verges on a cartoon villain : he looks like Tweety Pie's Sylvester . There's some black humor , mainly in the first part ; it tends to become repetitive after a while . Anyway the place where Brian works is two-bit sci-fi and the scientist's dumb-founded looks are priceless . So is Belushi's big bad wolf swagger . But the prize goes to M . Emmet Walsh's Sam : " don't do it here , please , take'em to the desert ! " " Retroactive " has a couldn't-care - less side which is quite entertaining . But if one seeks meaning and brain stuff , one must move on .
583938	1219578	65462	5.0	What lies beneath	Actually nothing extraordinary . Pierre Boulle's novel and Shaffner's movie had different endings , so you could not ask the French writer for a sequel . This one uses shots from the first one , and allows us to see the fascinating " discovery " scene once more . As for Ted Post's work , it's OK . Nothing extraordinary , but entertaining all along the way . We are far from the heights of the Shaffner's movie though . Zira and Cornelius disappear too soon , and Heston , after a short stint , only comes for the final apocalypse . None of the actors remaining on the " stage " can sustain emotion and tension . THe settings in the subterraneans where the men live are impressive , but why do they worship the bomb ? The most moving part happens when Nova , out of despair , manages to speak ( in Boulle's book , Taylor ( Mérou ) taught her the human language ) . The end of the movie seemed definitive . And yet . .
583198	1219578	120018	5.0	The title is apt as far as the second part is concerned .	This Chabrol's movie begins well with funny characters , Michel Serrault cast as a bogus colonel , Huppert , as a bogus femme fatale , and FRançois Cluzet as a security guard working for shady guys . The scenes in the ski resort and on the plane , with a witty dialog including money , of course , gastronomy , army ( Ah ! our beautiful French Army ! an old and distinguished lady tells the " colonel " ) , and even Dead Poet Society ( watch out for the lines ) . Then , half-way through , the movie loses steam , the pace becomes too slow , the dialog ponderous . Jean-François Balmer ( a great actor though ) and his gang of baddies are not convincing , being too stereotyped compared to the three initial characters . At times , it would seem that Chabrol and his actors preferred to enjoy the sea sun and beach of the wonderful setting . Hence this disappointing second part where " rien ne va plus " ( nothing works anymore ) , and with a very trite ending at that ! Average .
584520	1219578	55032	5.0	menage à Trois	François Truffaut's third film is generally celebrated as a benchmark in his filmography but also in the Nouvelle Vague and even of the whole French cinema . Once again , such paeans of praise for this good but by no means extraordinary work go beyond me . A lot of viewers seemed to have been conquered by this story which is basically a novel penned by Henri-Pierre Roché . The former reviewer at the Cahiers Du Cinéma who once lambasted major French filmmakers of the forties and the fifties was struck by the mix of improper and purity which suffused in the novel . This is what galvanized him to film this unique story , at least for him and for the supporters of the film . The first thing to bear in mind is that the starting point ( two men and a women living together for a long period of their lives ) isn't new . In 1933 , Ernst Lubitsch had signed a work called " Design for Living " . This sparkling comedy already sheltered a " menage à Trois " and was much more enjoyable and accessible than Truffaut's arty work . " Jules et Jim " was also celebrated for its innovative directing and its stunning camera work . Okay , it's a bonus for the film but once again I could argue that there is nothing astounding about it . On the same year the movie opened in 1962 , John Frankenheimer cranked out the mind-boggling " the Mandchurian Candidate " . It's not the same kind of film at all but I was much more very taken with the filmmaker's camera work which worked wonders to serve a far-fetched but thoroughly riveting story . Frankenheimer's magnum opus did better since it heralded the political thriller which had its hour or rather decade glory in the seventies with works like Alan J . Pakula's " the Parallax View " ( 1974 ) . In " Jules et Jim " , the creative liberties dear to the New Wave clique are well present and enhanced to try to reflect the mood a sequence could convey , especially in the first half ( before the war ) which brims with happiness and lightness . The whole dovetailed to establish a good dose of escape and dream to the audience . Actually , Truffaut's movie is half successful in the way the first part ( before the war ) makes sense in my eyes . There is none disadvantage in watching a threesome of two men and a woman leading a freewheeling life without any major problems ( financial or other ) . But after the war , the second part veers to a somber direction and things go wrong because their demeanors are elusive to my mind . I don't understand their actions , their motivations , especially Jules ' . If he is so unfortunate with Catherine , then why doesn't he go away ? Catherine's character seems to be dangerous because she jeopardizes Jules and Jim's friendship . Catherine's behavior and persona leave me baffled . What doesn't facilitate things is that she pronounces one cue which can infuriate the ones who aren't touched by this story : " I don't want to be understood " . Besides , I do think that Truffaut's film is peppered with lines which seem ludicrous to me such as " it's twenty to one " , " an angel is passing " " it's normal , angels pass at twenty of every hour " . " Jules et Jim " is the Nouvelle Vague in all its splendor and its pretensions with an emphasis on the form rather than the content which remains unfathomable to me . Storytelling is not Truffaut's forte or otherwise it obeys to a form of logic which is out of reach to me . That's what I want to gently laugh at his contention that " a film is a story and a story has to be told . Even in the cinema " . But in spite of his tricks and devices to tell the steps of this story and make the characters likable ( use of neutral voice-over ) , I'm not touched at all . What to say about the cast ? Each actor has the head in the clouds , seems to act apart their respective roles . Hence , an impression of false . Jeanne Moreau is a remarkable actress but elsewhere and still today . Check François Ozon's latest opus " Le Temps Qui Reste " ( 2005 ) . She only appears ten minutes but her part is momentous and understandable for the progression of Romain's sickness . I'll surely provoke an angry response from the defenders of the film but " Jules et Jim " , this mix of slightness and gravity in the same bag has no effect on me . But there are some of Truffaut's " Nouvelle Vaguesque " peers for whom the notion of storytelling is absent from their cinematographic concerns like Jean-Luc Godard's stream of consciousness-like Pierrot Le Fou " ( 1965 ) .
584997	1219578	62671	5.0	The Taggart tag along . . .	" Whatever happened to baby Jane " was a turning point in Bette Davis's career . " Hush hush sweet Charlotte " was almost as good , and she got first-class support from De Havilland , Cotten and Moorehead . With " the nanny " , and without a Robert Aldrich to direct , the formula began to wear thin . " The nanny " is an interesting work for fantasy and horror buffs though . I expected much of " the anniversary " probably too much . This movie comes one or two decades too late . All we see on the screen , Tennessee Williams had invented it long before , with his classy plays such as " the cat on the hot tin roof " and " suddenly last Summer " . Is there only a director here ? It's so talky that it looks like a bad filmed stage production . One-eyed Davis overacts ( why do you suppose she's like that ? don't worry , you will find out ) and as she has no Crawford or De Havilland to counterbalance , she becomes a caricature of herself . There are so many films where Davis is brilliant ! Why would you chose this one among all her awesome filmography ?
583456	1219578	274309	5.0	I wish I could love this movie . . .	As I am a big fan of the bands who secured the glory of Factory Records , especially Joy Division and Durutti Column , I was quite impatient to discover " 24 Hour Party People " . I watched it last night and the first thing i will say will be the following one : how disappointed I was ! The scriptwriter Frank Cottrell Boyce and especially the director Michael Winterbottom did a really bad work and I will try to explain why . For me " 24 Hour Party People " is an enjoyable movie to listen to , mainly thanks to the music . Someone has written on this site that you had to be British to appreciate the music . Not necessarily . I am myself French and I love most of the bands who signed for Factory Records . Obviously , you have to like this time ( English independent music of the eighties ) , this culture . That said , these bands aren't very known in France where they remain at the stage of cult-bands . Michael Winterbottom's flick was apparently successful in Great-Britain , but in France it was belatedly launched ( on the 4th June 2003 ) and it went unnoticed . But the main problem is that " 24 Hour Party People " is , visually an exhausting movie to watch . I must say that I don't appreciate very much the making adopted by Winterbottom . There's an amateurish side , reinforced by a granular and quite dirty photography in his way of filming that I highly disapprove . It seems that his camera can't stand still even in the quietest moments . On another hand , when the movie arrives at the end of the eighties ( the golden age for Manchester ) , as if he wanted to recreate the crazy atmosphere of the town in 1989-1990 , he didn't skimp on the flashy effects which ends up annoying the spectator . Then , Winterbottom must have been influenced by " Trainspotting " ( 1996 ) because in his directing , we can sometimes detect a video clip side . To go on , the authors of the movie seem to have forgotten one important thing . Factory Records wasn't only limited to Joy Division and the Happy Mondays . There was also Durutti Column and New Order . All right , the movie doesn't forget them but you can only see them for a few minutes . Given that , the film nearly skips the mid-eighties and quite obviously Joy Division and the Happy Mondays's careers especially interested the authors . Due to this , you can easily separate the movie in two parts . The first one mainly focuses on Joy Division while the second involves mostly the Happy Mondays . This characteristic is confirmed with the cover of the original soundtrack which depicts Tony Wilson ( of course ) but also Ian Curtis and Shaun Ryder . By way of consolation , we can object that Winterbottom had intuition for the cast because the actors he hired to play the musicians are very true to life , especially the ones in the roles of Ian Curtis and Bernard Sumner . Furthermore , the actor who acts Martin Hannett is very convincing in the shameless personality of this extraordinary producer . Tony Wilson's voice-off is necessary to guide us through the most important stages . So as to give the spectator interest in the film , it can also be a good thing to make Wilson directly speak to the camera to make us share his feelings , his thoughts on Manchester , the music . So long as this idea doesn't overload the movie and I have unfortunately this impression . Winterbottom and Boyce should have restrained these too frequent apparitions . The screenplay retained the most outstanding moments in the history of Tony Wilson and Factory Records but it doesn't stop it from having neglecting important stages as well . For example , I am sure that the fans of Joy Division would have liked to see the band recording their great disembodied album , " Closer " ( 1980 ) . Then , in the first part of the work , the " punk " and " new-wave " spirit are well rendered ( in one sequence , we see one character taking off from the wall a poster depicting Pink Floyd's album " Dark Side Of The Moon " ( no Pink Floyd in 1977 ! ) as well as the festive one in the second part through the Hacienda and ecstasy . But because , the director wanted to dazzle the spectator , at a visual level , it is difficult to fully enjoy this exhausting film . So you are never touched by a movie that is meant to take a nostalgic look at a past time . This is my opinion about " 24 Hour Party People " : excellent music but an average movie . If a director wishes to make a film about Alan McGee , the former boss of Creation Records ( Oasis and Primal Scream's former record company ) , I hope he won't do the same mistakes as Michael Winterbottom with this flick .
583998	1219578	58003	5.0	spleen . . or tedium ?	After a neorealist period ( Il grido ) , Antonioni begins his movies dealing with incommunicability with " l'avventura " in 1960 , continues with " la notte " ( 1961 ) and " l'eclisse " ( 1962 ) . This trilogy is in black and white and features Monica Vitti , his favorite actress - although in " la notte " she's only supporting , the main part being played by Jeanne Moreau - . ' IL deserto rosso ' is more of the same ; it's even more difficult and austere than the three former movies . It is the first time Antonioni has experimented color and the results are impressive : he creates a depressing landscape where the colors are cold , drab and dirty . The depiction of an industrial dehumanized world is convincing as Vitti , suffering from neurosis , roams aimlessly along this desert ( wonderful lines : her son : " the yellow smoke contains poison , the birds will die " ; mother : " no , they know it does , and they don't come here anymore " ) . During almost two hours , absolutely nothing happens , frames of mind , people holding conversations that are always incomplete , pointless actions , roads leading nowhere . . . . The problem is : are we moved by all that ? Can we relate to this woman's despair ? As far I'm concerned , only partially , not to say bluntly no . Incommunicability had already been treated by Roberto Rosselini : in " Europa 51 " he put Ingrid Bergman in the same world as Vitti ; when the world pressure began too hard to bear , she rebelled in her own way , she did not accept the society in which she lived in , nothing to do with Vitti's listless character . In " Viaggio in Italia " , the invisible wall between a man and his wife ( George Sanders and Bergman ) was already here . This couple vibrated through their suffering and their despair , Vitti and her husband do not . Rosselini created flesh and blood characters , Antonioni's ones have ectoplasm strength : such are the two characters of " l'avventura " searching for a disappeared girl , the wealthy couple of " la notte " - who only exists because played by peerless Mastroianni and Moreau - , forgetting their ennui in their friend's palace . " My characters move in a rich milieu , because their feeling are not brought about by money " Antonioni used to say . That does not prevent them from being selfish , egocentric and " I-me-mine " . With his follow-up " blow-up " , Antonioni gained world-wide success and he continued the color experiment , as an acid green London testifies . The plot becoming completely abstract , the characters will become less important , therefore a more satisfying movie . Until the very end , as he was disabled , Antonioni was obsessed by color : his last movie was a remake of Jean Cocteau's " l'aigle à deux têtes " , with a stunning color treatment .

Her work begins to surface again , but really little by little . Some critics said that the laurels Agnès Varda won were actually Jacqueline Audry's . She had only one subject : woman . But who could do it better than a woman ? She was probably the first artist to cast a lesbian as a lead ( in Jean-Paul Sartre's " huis clos " , all the same ! ) ; just before " les petits matins " , she made " le secret du chevalier d'Eon " which cast Andrée Debar as a woman dressed up as a man . " Les petits matins " is a story of eighteen-year old Agathe with a firm independence of men even if she uses them to get to the côte d'azur . Along the way she meets a lot of people-because it's finally a road movie - , mostly men , whom the director does not spare : the macho proud of their brand new car , the forty-something who wants to take Agathe home , the strange handsome guy ( Robert Hossein ) under his mother ' s thumb - a spoof on Hitchcock's characters ? - . This is very light stuff , nothing intellectual , but often charming and there's a bevy of famous actors : Jean - Claude Brialy , Claude Rich , Lino Ventura , François Perrier , Pierre Brasseur , and the couple Bernard Blier / Arletty who team up for the first time since Marcel Carné's " Hôtel du Nord " ( 1938 ) . Plus two singers , the first of whom plays but does not sing ( Gilbert Becaud who wrote " let it be me " and " what now my love ? " ) , the second sings the title song but does not play . ( Charles Aznavour ) Agathe Aems who plays the lead never made another movie before or since .

Both him and Jean Boyer wanted Bourvil to play the lead . But the actor was reluctant , knowing Fernandel had created the role in the thirties . " But said Pagnol , you will be a better Normand than him cause you are Normand and your colleague was Provençal ! " The first scene is enough to convince you the part was tailor-made for Bourvil : the village idiot , leaping about in the meadows where the cows browses on peacefully , picking flowers . . . but when a woman comes near , he's so afraid he runs away . . . . Madame Husson and her circle of holier-than-thou ladies - including an old maid Madame Cadenas ( = Mrs Padlock ( sic ) ) - are looking for a chaste and pure girl who will win a hefty sum ! There's just one problem : the virgin girls are so rare that they are forced to elect a man : the village idiot ! Maupassant's story is faithfully transferred to the screen in the two first thirds of the movie . Pagnol's dialog scores high and the movie is much fun to watch . But the last third drastically wanders from the writer's work . When Bourvil leaves the fête and goes to the pond , and realizes how miserable he is , one thinks for a while that the thespian will turn the comedy into a drama - he is as skillful an actor to do this - . But the ending is finally disappointing , some days in Paris are not enough to transform a sexually repressed man such as him ! N . B : In Maupassant's short story , Isidore , the goofy peasant , goes to Paris too , but he begins to drink hard and becomes a wreck . His mother turns his prodigal son out , and he becomes a carter , with no love of his own , of course . Maupassant was not as optimistic as Pagnol .

Like in the disaster movies , there are many subplots most of them independent . The difference is that there is NO disaster ; do not expect a wreckage : the " Normandie " is not another " Titanic " . Some of the subplots : 1 ) A detective ( Simon ) is in charge of an invaluable diamond ; well , diamonds may be a girl's best friend , but this precious stone story is not the best thing in the movie . Disappointing ending . 2 ) A man travels with his missus and his secretary who is also his mistress . Against all odds , the two women become good friends .

But he discovers she is a rich girl and the papa says no to the union . One evening , dad disappears . What do you suppose that means ? Unlike the diamond stuff , the ending of this plot is a bit unexpected and makes sense . What the movie lacks is unity and a great writer .

583060	1219578	309872	6.0	ready for anything to be successful ?	Either it is in France , Great-Britain or in the USA , nearly every big actor felt one day or another to take a turn behind the camera to show their potential as a director . Guillaume Canet , a young charismatic actor added his name to this list which keeps on extending . With " mon idole " ( 2002 ) , his first long feature movie is strongly rooted in the contemporary reality with the following topics : the hypnotic power of television on the public and the relations of manipulation . However , this exercise of style leaves a bitter taste in the mouth after the vision even if the result is far from being uninteresting . Do you remember professor Castro's leitmotiv in Alejandro Amenabar's thriller " Tesis " ( 1996 ) ( We must give the public what he demands . . . ) . The professor thought of the violence . Today , the public wants not only violence but also daring TV shows pushed to the voyeurism . The satire is well here at the beginning of the movie during the TV show . Moreover , later the film contains a significant detail : Jean Louis Broustal breeds vultures . The metaphor is obvious . Nowadays , TV shows , especially TV reality occupy an enormous place in our lives and it can be source of wealth and respectability for the ones who run them . Besides , Canet seizes the opportunity to deride them . The sequence when Broustal , his wife and a friend of them are dancing in the living-room dressed in silly costumes constitutes a good example . It wouldn't be fair to call Broustal's wife a grown-up because she is still a child deep inside her . As for Broustal , all in all he is an eternal pampered child who only thinks of having fun . Now to come back to the starting point , Bastien ( Guillaume Canet is an ambitious young man who would like to climb the ladder in television . He has a project for the telly and he presents it to his manager Jean Louis Broustal ( François Berléand ) . It is useful to add that Bastien is widely impressed by this apparently serious man . Broustal is interested by Bastien's plan and decides to invite him in his country house in the country for the week-end . But Bastien is going to find out that his real motivations are drastically different from Broustal's . It is quite easy to guess Canet's major inspirations . His movie finds itself half-way between " Masques " ( 1987 ) by Claude Chabrol for the setting , the first part of the story , the food and the cinema of the Coen brothers for the caustic tone . There are also strong echoes of " une étrange affaire " ( 1981 ) by Pierre Granier-Deferre . Canet seems to be film-loving to the core . He has also had intuition for the cast . Having hired François Berléand , a largely underrated French actor with a rich filmography was a good idea . Furthermore , him and Canet are well followed by the rest of the cast . The satire is quite fierce , the situations are comical , the actors feel visibly at ease in their respective roles . So , what is wrong with " mon idole " ? Well , first Canet's opus appears a little hesitating because it wavers between comedy , drama and detective movie and as a consequence the young director has difficulty to find a unity and a lasting tone . Actually , the first part of the movie is the most successful . Gradually , we feel the suspense rising and Broustal's real intentions are taking shape . Roughly , we discover that Canet offers us a farce . Problem : it happens in the middle of the film and has strong chances to run out of steam quite quickly . So in order to restart the interest of the spectator , Canet tries his hand at black humor ( the moment when Broustal's wife is involuntarily killing Broustal's friend ) and it is where the movie goes awry . In a way , the young director artificially furnished the second part of the movie and it involves a lack of cohesion to the whole . As a result , Canet wanders from his subject and his movie has difficulty to hold water . What can we say about his making ? It alternates the best and the worst . There's a careful work on light and the scenery but Canet doesn't avoid the flashy effects like to prove his master of making . But if there's a thing in the film that is spoiled , it is the music . About it , " mon idole " has a common feature with Cameron Crowe's movie " Vanilla Sky " ( 2001 ) : both present a badly used and sometimes too intrusive music . Maybe Canet's work is worse because a few songs in it by the feelings they bring out haven't got their place in a story like this one . At the end of the movie we hear " Abraham , Martin and John " ! What did Canet think of when he wrote this sequence ? That's a real disgrace from Canet . Let's also regret a somewhat unsuccessful end because Canet couldn't use a thing that could have kicked the bull's eye : immorality . So , " mon idole " is an interesting but heterogeneous work which could have been much better . It's a shame for Guillaume Canet . But if he wants to shot a second movie maybe will he correct his mistakes .

Many viewers took the little catchy sentence at the time the film opened in December 2003 very seriously : " Don't go and watch it , it's rubbish " . But in a way , by choosing such words , the director-actor Laurent Baffie condemned the commercial potential of his work . So , commercial fiasco was nearly inevitable . However , I must admit that his oddball film is not that much bad . I know that Baffie is a humorist man who has a special sense of humor but I've never seen or read any of his productions . Here , I can easily understand why hardly anybody went to see his movie and also why " La Crème De La Crème " of well-famous French actors and prestigious producers refused to act in Baffie's work ( but maybe , was it a cunning trick from Baffie to include all of them in his film ) . But he entertained me for one hour and a half and if you're looking for something quirky , offbeat in the territory of the French comedy , why not testing it ? Obviously , Baffie's movie isn't exempted from negative points . There are some irregularities in his scenario . During one fleeting moment , he says to his pal Daniel Russo that he needs a twist to boost his ( cock-and-bull ) story again . But before , he claims having conceived and penned his scenario for three years . So , he should logically know how his scenario is built instead of thinking about a twist at the last minute ! Then , certain comical effects are ponderous and there is a wearisome sensation of general overflow sometimes on the brink of indigestion . Sometimes , it's also hard to discern if what we watch on the screen is an integral part of the film that Baffie strives to shoot or not like the sequence with the bank manager . A bank manager acted by a French humorist Jean-Marie Bigard who , here was surprisingly good and refrained himself from virtually any saucy lines apart from two or three exceptions . Baffie is well aware that his plan is a dead loss but his product constantly maintains the interest because he takes the audience on the way of the unexpected . His film virtually evolutes on the razor's edge and is much fun to watch with its unplanned detours and digressions . If they seem sometimes overlong , Baffie always bears in mind that he tries to create a film about two guys who lost their car keys and seek them . To find them again , he's ready to blindly trust people likely to to give him clues about these keys like the children . Don't we say that " out of the mouths of babes and sucklings comes forth truth " ? To buy a dog trained to bring car keys back might also be a good idea . . . In the bargain , the director-actor has a sense of absurd ( the door in his flat which leads to the beach ) and indulges in inserting in his work hilarious spoofs like the moment when Russo and Lucie are outside the Café . . . and we are entitled to a swift but great spoof on mawkish movie . The wacky humor has something of " La Cité De La Peur " ( 1994 ) , the film of " Les Nuls " . Besides , Alain Chabat has a cameo as an employee in a pet shop . He only appears five minutes but we remember well his role . Baffie also seems to be a wizard at cinema . His film is filled with many film-loving hints , winks , references which sometimes arrive just at the right moment . After Baffie and Russo went to the chic restaurant , Russo feels sick and throws it up . On an awning , in front of them , one can read the title of Marco Ferreri's film : " La Grande Bouffe " ( 1973 ) . Then , we can be grateful to Baffie to present us a few lessons about cinema in general like the ellipse or the little lecture about the ingredients to make a good film . If you don't take seriously this farce , you may have fun with perhaps this future sleeper .
585167	1219578	122933	6.0	mafia blues	If one analyzes the basic topic of this slick comedy , one realizes that it had a certain potential to charm Hollywood producers and to score well at the American box-office . Take a powerful but neurotic , bilious gangster named Paul Vitti ( Robert De Niro ) who suffers from crises of anxiety and make him nag at a peaceful analyst ( Billy Cristal ) to cure him in a few days . As it was expected , it antagonizes his wife ( Lisa Kudrow ) and awakes suspicion from the police . The filmmaker Harold Ramis signed a shrewd , canonical film a few years before he began the shooting of this one : " Groundhog Day " ( 1993 ) in which subtlety was a winning weapon . Here in our work that is chiefly a present vehicle for the two main stars , subtlety is more sporadic and consequently " Analyze This " doesn't match the brilliance of the 1993 film . Even if it's a little impersonal work from Ramis , this work is watchable if not memorable . The methodology of this comedy is reliant on a formulaic master plan and a well-defined road : as soon as Vitti pesters his shrink and invades his life for poor Ben it's the end of serenity . It's all the more dismaying as he was to marry with his fiancée ( why has her father to be a cardboard character ? ) who has a grudge on him . Ramis and his scenarists toy with several types of comic processes and it gives way to subtle , verbal lines or irresistible comic situations but also ponderous ones which unbalances the film in its comic processes . But one stays to the end of this excursion which fulfills its pledges : to entertain thanks mainly to its stars and also to parody the ruthless world of the mafia . The winning team and the formula were to be hired again three years later for the underwhelming " Analyze That " ( 2002 ) .
584853	1219578	41763	7.0	Let me ride on the wall of death one more time . . . .	. . . You can waste your time on the other ridesBut this is the nearest to being aliveOh let me take my chances on the wall of death . ( Richard Thompson ) This is a mysterious film . The precedent user was cross cause they did not mention Maria Montez's name on the DVD or video cassette release . He must realize that it's aimed at the French market and in France , who remembers this beautiful but limited ( at least to my eyes , and at least in this film , the only one I've seen featuring her to date ) actress ? The French cast is a dream : first it was Arletty's comeback ; after the problems she had in 1945 , and the unfinished Carné's " la Fleur de l'Age , it was the first film she had made since " les Enfants du Paradis " . The male cast is exciting too : Erich Von Stroheim , and two other Carné's favorites , Pierre Brasseur and Jules Berry . The subject is original . Brasseur portrays a stunt-man who rides his motorbike on the wall of death . He's married to Martha whose love is strong and true but he has come to hate her : he tries to kill her in the first sequence ! But Martha forgives and she delivers a wonderful line " For once , the victim also provides the alibi " . Enter manager Montez : she wants the acrobat to work on a larger scale and she asks an engineer ( Marcel Dalio , who was in " la règle du jeu " and " Casablanca " ) to build a huge track where the man will perform a terrifying looping the loop . The script lacks sometimes rigor and Von Stroheim's character - a disabled man , after working for Montez - repeats more or less the same lines every time he appears . On the other hand , Bernard-Roland perfectly captured the fair / circus atmosphere . He even hired the Fratellinis , a famous clowns family . Probably influenced by Carné and Duvivier , the director continued the Realisme Poétique of the pré-war years and its pessimism . He could have been a heir to that tradition , as contemporary Yves Allégret was . But he essentially worked for TV .
584232	1219578	65195	7.0	Take a walk with John Huston . . .	. . . . through the MIddle Ages in France . A voice over warns us : this is the story of a boy and a girl . Something has begun ( the Hundred Years War ) : they have not seen the beginning and they will not see the end . Who did anyway ? It takes place in France and it was not meant to be realistic ; its closest relatives are arguably Bergman's " the seventh seal " ( 1957 ) and Marcel Carné's " les Visiteurs du soir " ( 1942 ) . The three works are fables , the MIddle-Age being an alibi - , and the three of them feature a stunning ending : the dance macabre in the Bergman's work , the hearts still beating in stone in Carné's and the " return to the sea " in this one . Many of the permanent features of the great director emerge in " Walk " : the odd pair ( Assaf Dayan is childlike , naive and chivalrous whereas Huston - who was only eighteen - seems a mature woman who still believes in a society which would survive till 1789 ! those who fight , those who pray and those who work ) , the absurdity of any quest ( what's good going to Paris ? the heroine says . What's good escaping again ? ) , the presence of death ( which predates Huston's last film - the Dead - by fifteen years ; and A . Huston is in that film too ) , the stranglehold religion had on the minds and on the souls . The 1965-1975 years were a period of barren inspiration for Huston , they say , but it did provide at least two masterworks : the underrated overlooked " Reflection in a golden eye " which is looked upon as a classic in France and which was very faithful to McCullers ' novel and the grandiose " Man who would be king " . " A walk with Love and Death " is second only to these , being more original than " fat city " and beating hands down the harmless " sinful Davy " and the muddled " Kremlin letter " and " Mackintosh Man " . Beautiful luminous cinematography .
582919	1219578	52663	7.0	Le Dernier Tournant .	Pierre Chenal's last hurrah-although not his last movie - , it's easily the best of the four thrillers he made when he was back from Argentina . " Jeux Dangereux " the precedent year suggested a return to form for a director who made interesting film noirs in the thirties and a masterpiece in the forties ( " La Foire Aux Chimères " ) . All promises were fulfilled in " La Bete A L'Affut " . There are two apparently distinct plots : - A cop's widow ( Françoise Arnoul ) is through with love and she spends her time collecting money for the orphans of the Police , abetted by a bunch of snobs and false friends . Unfortunately the person who was in charge of the money is assaulted and the money is gone . . Might this respectable notable of the town be the stealer , after feigning an aggression ? - A warden has two inmates do some repairs in his house . But he's got a too pretty wife . Two of the men are killed in mysterious circumstances and the survivor , one of the prisoners ( Henri Vidal ) takes refuge in the widow's desirable mansion . Love begins to grow between them but is the man a victim of fate as he claims to be ? The screenplay is particularly smart as the two stories meet in the last minutes . There's also a grandiose finale in a lighthouse , with scenes to rival the best of Jacques Tourneur . Henri Vidal was perhaps never better than here and his pairing with sexy Françoise Arnoul was really a good one . The last scene was particularly harrowing when you know that Vidal was to pass away in December 1959 , leaving Belmondo and Delon a clear field . NB : Henri Vidal was disappointed with the roles he was given . He wanted to make movies with Carné , Clouzot , Allégret and Delannoy and his fine physique went against him .
583057	1219578	52251	7.0	Forbidden games	Pierre Chenal was a minor but interesting director who in the late thirties was the first to transfer to the screen " the postman always rings twice " . His masterpiece was " la foire aux chimères " ( all Erich Von Stroheim's fans MUST see that work ) where he introduced an extraordinary dreamlike atmosphere which we also find in inferior efforts such as " la maison du maltais " or " l'alibi " . " Les jeux dangereux " seems realistic at first sight . Actually , it's almost as offbeat , as unusual as the aforementioned films . " Game " is the keyword and when he puts the pieces of the jigsaw together again that the private eye realizes that it's a child's game ( the water pistol is the best " clue " ) . A teenage girl ( a beautiful Pascale Audret , singer Hugues Aufray's sister , she resembles Audrey Hepburn ) , whose brother is in jail because he has shot a policeman , tries to get him the best lawyer . So helped by her pack , she kidnaps an adolescent - poisoned by his mother's protection and whose father is a stingy hateful bourgeois-and they lock him in a cellar . So begins the game which will sometimes verge on tragedy . These youngsters ( with the exception of Sami Frey's character , the only one who acts as a " man " so to speak ) . Everyone plays , and after all , the victim himself plays the violin , plays cards with his jailer . The adults are not models for them anyway , being mean like the rich kid's father , his over-possessive mother or the two-bit detective ' s embittered wife . Even the love story between Audret and her prisoner makes sense . And even if this is a rather happy end , the establishment has won anyway . But the private eye's last words ( it's my reward ) restore our faith in grown - ups
584341	1219578	284573	7.0	Girod's best since " le trio infernal " .	Francis Girod began his career with a scandalous movie : Romy Schneider , who was looked upon as a Madonna by most of the FRench audience became one the most disgusting criminals an actress had ever played . Since he watered down his wine and subsequent works were much more moderate ( " Lacenaire " " la banquière " ) when they were not drastic failures ( " descente aux enfers " " passage à l'acte " . " Mauvais genres " is a return to form for Girod . He has never been so nefarious since his debut . Two actors give stunning performances : Robinson Stevenin plays a transvestite , a part so difficult - he is on the screen from the beginning to the end - it's a miracle he could pull it off so brilliantly . But Richard Bohringer's cop is even more impressive : his character speaks in a croaking voice , close to a whisper . Meava the transsexual is probably the most humane character in the whole movie . The plot is so complex it will demand several viewings . A lot of elements interfere : a serial killer who kills male and female prostitutes , a transvestite whose father has just been arrested for pedophilia - which might or might not lead his son ( Stevenin ) whom he abused to lead such a life - ; the " sens interdit " ( one-way street ) gay club where you can see a drag act , the " twin duet " featured in Demy ' s " les demoiselles de Rochefort " ; elements of melodrama : the past of the characters recalls those endless novels from the nineteenth century when the characters did not know exactly who their father was ; and a love the hero feels for a so-called straight mover ( who's also a gigolo ) . But more than the story , it's the atmosphere which matters . Girod creates a destabilizing world which leaves the viewer panting for breath . And it's not sexist . The monsters are not necessarily the non-straights .
583239	1219578	118117	7.0	Rebel with a cause	The connection with James Dean ? In a short plan , we see Emilio Estevez toying with a teddy bear ( remember the first scene of Ray's " rebel without a cause " ) . Moreover , the main conflict is Estevez versus Sheen , father against son , as in " East of Eden " . The soldier has come home , and nobody has been able to communicate with him , even his sister ( a psychology student , what a derision ) . The mother , a crude matron ( a superb Kathy Bates ) , gets bogged down in nougatine , she ' s not able to understand that her values ( religion , family ) have become a thing of the past , specially for someone like his son whose innocence was betrayed . The father , an irresolute man , under his wife's thumb , although he tries hard to play the macho , wanted to make up for the mediocrity of his life . So he saved his " honor " by forcing his son to do his duty . The scene in which Estevez's hatred for his father explodes is very intense . The actor-director gives a restrained performance , interiorized , as Lee Strasberg's students used to do , and his final burst of anger is increased tenfold so .
582930	1219578	126734	7.0	The heart is no longer a lonely hunter .	Guédiguian tackles here a subject which Marcel Pagnol treated many times some sixty years ago : the pregnant girl and the fate of the soon-to - be born baby : " Angèle " ( 1934 ) " Fanny " ( 1936 ) and " la fille du puisatier " ( 1942 ) Both Guediguian's and Pagnol's works are set in the Provence . But the times have changed . Once , being an unmarried mother was a shame , a curse and if the girl did not find a man to save her honor , she was outlawed from society ( In Pagnol ' s movies ) . A young girl falls in love with a black young man and gets pregnant , but the poor boy is accused of rape . The parents ' attitude is diametrically opposite to that of the people of the thirties : this baby is a hope , the only hope in fact , the only thing that prevents the jailed man from complete despair . In a very moving sequence , à la " it's a wonderful life " , the father explains how the baby's life touches so many other lives . Life is not rosy for these modest people but their struggle is noble and endearing : Ascaride's trip to Sarajevo is the center of gravity of the movie : she displays so much love , understanding , humanity and hope against hope that the audience feels relieved when she finally pulls it off . Much less ambitious than " la ville est tranquille " , " à la place du coeur " shows that sometimes , the heart is not a lonely hunter anymore . Acting is uniformly good . The only flaw is the fascist cop , the one cardboard character of the whole film .
584299	1219578	41378	7.0	The granddaddy of " 10 Rillington Place " and " The Boston Strangler "	The two movies I mention in my title were proofs positive that , all that Fleischer threatened to do in the film noir field all the promises were fulfilled . " Follow me quietly " can be looked upon as a blueprint for these masterful works . Its only flaw is its length : it's obviously too short , and we would like to know more about the Judge . This serial killer apparently " punishes " : like in Agatha Christie's famous " And then there were none " ( 1939 ) , a subject which was also that of the celebrated " Seven " . All the scenes which feature the dummy are extraordinary , and Fleischer shows his brilliance when it comes to make us feel he is " alive " . Outside these three works , do not miss early efforts such as " the clay pigeon " ( with a shoestring budget too ) " the narrow margin " or later works such as " blind terror " and " Solyent green " ( a sci fi classic with film noir accents ) ; only Fleischer's final movies were mediocre , the likes of " Amytiville " " Conan " and " Ashanti " which perhaps went against him and tarnished his image . Which was unfair .
584465	1219578	83287	7.0	Michel Blanc , the intruder .	When he started walking in the cinema , Patrice Leconte decided first to specialize in comedy . This one , will probably remain the best that he ever made . I found it superior to its predecessor : " les bronzés " ( 1978 ) with its crude and often vulgar humor . So , after he broached the behavior of the tourists when they're on holiday in the quoted movie , Leconte chose to broach a rather dramatic social problem on a tone comedy : the squatters . Either they gather in flats or tiny houses and they can become delinquents , either they ask hospitality to their close relatives or their friends . Here , the movie deals with the second case . Michel Blanc is fired from his job and becomes jobless and homeless . Bernard Giraudeau gives him hospitality and of course , Blanc agrees . As it was to be expected , Blanc's arrival changes completely Giraudeau's way of life and due to him , he's fired from his job too . Moreover , his wife's leaving him . . . Michel Blanc ' performance is worth the detour . An important part of the movie rests on his shoulders ans he's simply irresistible . He's also the cause of vexing situations for the characters . Besides , the set constitutes a plain comedy but funny enough to burst into laughter . Perhaps , the only fault of the movie is the following one : not going deeper into several situations . I especially think about the moment when Giraudeau is on the streets with Blanc . This moment is rather a bit of a mess and Giraudeau quickly succeeds in becoming reconciled with his wife . Apart from that , a pleasant comedy .
584216	1219578	104830	7.0	the master and the pupil	In the French humorous show , " les guignols de l'info " , Christophe Lambert often says in a weary tone : " Yeah , I know . All my movies are rotten . " Well , he should think twice before telling silly things . Indeed , " Max et Jérémie " ( 1992 ) is his best movie since " Greystoke " ( 1984 ) . And this terrific movie is perfectly mastered by Claire Devers . This woman's got plenty of nerve to film violence and blood . As it was the case with another French movie " the little criminal " ( 1990 , dialogs constitute the vividness of the movie . They contain a lot of humor that enables to keep the spectator in suspense . It also enables to reduce the seriousness of the dramatic side of the story . But especially , Claire Devers emphasized on the dialogs for a better focus on the relationships between the two men : on one hand , Jérémie ( Christophe Lambert ) : a lost young man who wishes to gain Philippe Noiret's friendship and on the other hand , Max ( Philippe Noiret ) , an elderly man who'll gradually become attached to Max . Little by little , a ( a bit confused but strong ) friendship will link the two men . Obviously , this friendship will have its ups and downs . Apart from this , the action sequences aren't neglected for all that and they turn out to be thrilling . At the end , the whole gives a stable movie and remarkably well constructed . In spite of a few weaknesses ( Claire Devers dressed a caricatured portrait of Jean-Pierre Marielle's assistant and the last twenty minutes tend to run out of steam ) , it's useless to be fussy for this brilliant success . This is arguably one of the best French detective movies of the nineties . At last , one thing I don't understand : how can such a good movie have a rather low mark on IMDB ? It's not fair , it deserves much more recognition .
584325	1219578	45478	7.0	And justice for no one .	At first sight , Duvivier seems to follow in André Cayatte's footsteps . At the time , the latter director had launched a crusade against all the miscarriages of justice and had begun to champion any good cause going . But further acquaintance shows this : " l'affaire Maurizius " is a Duvivier movie . In Cayatte's movies , the problems are finally generally solved : in " Nous Sommes Tous Des Assassins " , René was granted a pardon , in " Les Risques du Métier " , the schoolteacher was rehabilitated . Even when the story turns black ( " Le Glaive et la Balance " or " Justice est Faite " ) , Cayatte " manages to limit the damage " so to speak . One should note that the young lead , Jacques Chabassol , was part of Cayatte's " Avant le Deluge " ( 1953 ) . In " l'Affaire Maurizius " , no one was saved : the judge has lost his son who is ashamed of his father , the son has lost all his illusions , the gorgeous reluctant femme fatale has turned into a prematurely aged lady , her former lover is now living on the fringes of society , and the chastised innocent . . . . . . his fate is sealed as soon as the film begins . . . . . . . because , when the movie begins , " L'Affaire Maurizius " is an old one everybody wants to forget . That an innocent man may have spent seventeen years in jail does not seem to move the bourgeois judge ( Charles Vanel ) , jealous of his privileges . Little by little , through flashbacks , scenes of the past resurfaces again . The judge ' s son believes in justice and wants to save the prisoner ( Daniel Gélin ) who was " burried alive " . But Waremme ( Anton Walbrook ) tries to explain to him that the society scoffs at the law : while he is talking to the desperate young man , two dancers appear as shadow graphs on the window . This is the key to the film and to Duvivier's black world . " L'Affaire Maurizius " is wrapped in mystery : all the flashbacks are filmed in places which seem secret and where a danger seems impending . The film sets are bare when they depict the past , emphasizing the characters who , unfortunately , with the exception of Vanel , sometimes display a tendency to overact . This misty atmosphere will emerge again in later works such as " Marianne de Ma Jeunesse " or " La Chambre Ardente " . Some objections to " l'Affaire Maurizius " remain : overacting ( Anton Walbrook verges on ridicule ) , and Madeleine Robinson's underwritten part : she barely appears ten minutes whereas she plays a pivotal role in the screenplay . Her relationship with her younger sister ( Eleonora Rossi-Drago ) is only skimmed over whereas it is essential to the plot . However , like almost all the movies Duvivier made , it is a must : his pessimism leaves the viewer no hope : the last scene could be subtitled " out of the blue . . . and into the black , they give you this but you pay for that , and once you're gone you can never come back . . " ( Neil Young )
582455	1219578	104025	7.0	crisis , what crisis ?	On the same day , Victor ( Vincent Lindon ) loses both his wife and a very lucrative job in his firm . Miserable and hopeless he's looking for his friends and family in the country to tell his personal turmoil and hoping to find some relief . But he only receives indifference or misunderstanding . Only a little man Michou ( Patrick Timsit ) is his confident and seems to be the key to solve Victor's inner trouble . Coline Serreau is known and even celebrated in France for her popular comedy " Trois Hommes et Un Couffin " ( 1985 ) with which she scored a big hit so much so that an American remake followed a couple of years later . Its follow-up , " Romuald et Juliette " ( 1989 ) didn't have as much impact . With " la Crise " , she pored over the mood of French society at the dawn of the nineties and it's a rather gloomy one . Her film could walk a fine line with works such as Gérard Jugnot's " une Epoque Formidable " ( 1991 ) . In this film , Jugnot favored laughter to assess a French society driven by financial laws and having lost human values . Coline Serreau takes back these observations and on a frenetic pace , she also relies on a sharp analysis of French society tangled up in stress and absence of communication but also politics eaten up by dishonesty and bribery . Her methodology to keep smiles on the viewer's face is shrewd : every time Victor meets someone and starts to tell him about his devilish day , he can't finish his story because his friends and family are amid their own problems and it's the opportunity for them to lay their souls bare and to express their formidable honesty and thoughts about who they really are or think . This method works but has also its evident limits in the sense that it makes the film a little monotonous and breathless by moments . But overall , Coline Serreau pulls it off with gusto to make us laugh of our woes . " La Crise " was nominated in several categories at the César awards ceremony in 1993 including Best Female Supporting Roles for Maria Pacôme and Zabou and it's a shame that they didn't catch it . The first one has only 15-20 minutes of appearance while the second one has about half an hour of presence on the screen but one clearly remembers their shows in which they demand to live their lives their own ways . In counterpart , the film garnered the César for the Best Scenario and I have my doubts about it because if Serreau's work is formidable but a little dull in its humorist conception , things go wrong in the last half hour when she adopts a conventional , cozy tone with an acceptation of naive solutions . It throws the film a little off balance and loses a part of its strength . See it anyway , its several ferociously funny moments make it worthwhile and fifteen years later , the thrust of " la Crise " is still a topical one .
583447	1219578	192444	7.0	Chimes of freedom	Although it happens in Flandres , in the sixteenth century , it is actually the occupied France in WW2 . During that period , the directors had to find their inspiration in the past as was so often the case with their movies of that era ( Carné's " Les Visiteurs Du Soir " ) . In 1945 , France was a free country again , and there was no more reason to " conceal " the message ; the directors , especially René Clément , made no bones about it ( " Le Père TRanquille " ) Oddly , " Patrie " ( = homeland , the title is revealing ) is about a Flemish abortive attempt to free themselves from the yoke of their oppressors , the Spanish . The Flemish as the French , the Spanish as the German , and a beautiful woman as a collaborationist . Pierre Blanchar is the leader of the rebels , his mission is to help Guillaume d'Orange get into the town and come to power ; but alas , his best friend , Carlo ( Jean Dessailly ) , is his wife's lover and she is not prepared to see her love sacrificed for the sake of the country . This is a really good drama in costume , with lots of courage , cruelty , treason , and a grandiose finale . Louis Daquin ' s way was very special : in " Nous Les Gosses " ( 1942 ) he put his trust in the future , then flirted with the Vichy ideology ( " Le Voyageur De La Toussaint " , and mainly " Premier De Cordée " ) before celebrating the resistance . Like this ? try this . . . . . " La Kermesse Héroïque " Jacques Feyder , 1935
583751	1219578	58150	7.0	From Ian Fleming novels to the screen . .	This is , along with " Thunderball " my all-time favorite Bond . These two movies were the last to follow just about Ian Fleming's plots . After his death , the writer asked the scenarists to write original screenplays while keeping his titles . This may account for the long and steady decline of the stories after " Thunderball " . Even a genuine artist like Roald Dahl could not save " you only live twice " . Not that Fleming's novels were that much good . What he wrote was very flat but it was daring , bold for the time . The movies ( the first ones that is ) are much more entertaining , but they are also watered-down ! People who read " Goldfinger " do know that the main Bond Girl character is Tilly Masterton ( who is killed in the movie by Odd's hat after a ten-minute appearance ) . The scenarists treated the character as anyone of them would have done with a gay character at the time . In the book , Tilly who is a lesbian meets Pussy Galore and falls in love with her ( not with Bond ! ) . She dies only at the very end of the book , the same way . Pussy Galore is a lesbian too - in movie it's suggested : her clothes , her swagger , her female pilots - but it's kept to the minimum . In the book , Pussy changes totally after meeting Bond , claiming she came to hate men because in her native state " a virgin is a girl who runs faster than her uncle " . What remains amazing is that the censorship did accept the very suggestive name " Pussy Galore " ( the scenarists wanted to change it for " Kitty Galore " but an article in an English magazine which showed " Prince Charles and Pussy " made them change their mind . A scene which scared me to death when I saw it in the movie theaters when I was 12 was that of the Golden Girl . The scenarists did a good job here : in the book , James Bond does not see Jill Masterton's body , he's been told the horrible story by sister Tilly just before both get captured by Goldfinger . Fleming's obsolete circular saw had been smartly replaced , by a laser beam . All in all , Guy Hamilton's film is better than Fleming's book . His sense of space ( and of humor ) made " Goldfinger " the most appreciated of all James Bond . Quite rightly so .
583440	1219578	38360	7.0	Heartbreak hotel	What's lacking here is a great director , someone like Robert Siodmak ( " Phantom Lady " ) or Mitchell Leisen ( " No man of her own " ) . Who says Truffaut ? ( " the bride wore black " ) . Even flawed , " Black Angel " is far better than the two Truffaut movies ( the second being " La Sirene Du Mississipi " ) cause only an American can feel the desperate atmosphere of Cornell Woolrich's ( aka William Irish ) best novels and short stories . Generally the character who experiments tragedy is a woman ; such is not the case here . Martin is the loser , the unfortunate expiatory victim who is looking for a second chance . Some people won't accept the fact that half of the action is based on a wrong track : it's necessary to make us feel Martin's growing hope . His moonlight sonata is not only a warning , it's also a love message ( look at his face when he is playing ) When Cathy tells him there can only be one man in her life , he's got no reason to live anymore . Hence this ending a la " lost weekend " ( which was released the precedent year ) and these words of Martin when he says he is happy now . William Irish's novel was arguably not his best : the story is too close to that of " phantom lady " and Cathy becoming a singer overnight is not very plausible . But it's Dan Duryea's hope against hope and his face longing for happiness and peace of mind that will haunt you after watching this good film noir .
582739	1219578	124314	8.0	Swing low , sweet chariot .	That was Duvivier's last work before WW2 , and a remake of Victor Sjostrom's eponymous movie , adapted from Selma Lagerlof . I've not seen the silent movie so I will avoid any comparison . . Duvivier's precedent movie " la Fin du Jour " still compares favorably to " Sunset Blvd " when it comes to depicting the aging thespians's tragedy . Duvivier is the French prince of the film noir , but I guess he could not provide the terrified 1939 audience with another of his despairing movies . " La charrette fantôme " is looked upon as a failure by most of the French critics as the follow-up ( " Untel Père et Fils " ) is but it should not be dismissed so quickly . Its conclusion might seem ponderous , full of finer feelings , a bit Capraesque . But the overall atmosphere is black : " it's not the infected beds they should burn , it's the whole humanity ! " a character says in the house for homeless the Salvation Army has built . Pure Duvivier line . Most of the movie takes place in the dregs of society where a sister ( Micheline Francey ) suffering from TB is desperately trying to save an alcoholic tramp ( Pierre Fresnay ) and to bring him back to his wife and kids . He had a friend , one of the last lonely and wretched like him , ( Louis Jouvet ) who died the last day of the precedent year and became the coachmann of the " Ghost Wagon " ( hence the title ) . And the sister fears he might be the next coachman as he might die at the end of this year . The realistic story and the supernatural one do not hang well , and the line ( " get out of your prison " ) the coachman repeats to the dead is a bit ludicrous ( but we have seen worse by today's standards ) . The special effects are not that much bad for 1939 and were probably inspired by previous experiments by Abel Gance ( " J'accuse " ) . Despite these reservations , Duvivier's directing remains impressive . There are great scenes in this uneven effort : a burning with fever Jouvet crawling on the snow-covered roof of the hospital ; the old lady too tired to carry on her earthly ride ; the luminous beaming face of Micheline Francey Duvivier lovingly filmed ; Fresnay in a bout of delirium tremens trying to force his way in his house ; his wife thinking of poisoning her children before herself . Duvivier was probably a believer : after all , he directed a life of Saint Therese de Lisieux well before Alain Cavalier , and even though most of his brilliant filmography depicts a terrifying humanity when he reportedly lost his faith , he probably never lost his faith in a superior strength . And on account of the impending mortal storm ( to quote Frank Borzage ) that was to fall on the human race at the time , who could blame him ?
583153	1219578	205932	8.0	A rendezvous I've been waiting so long for	While it is true that the interest for the New Wave has practically buried France's best films in a pile of neglect , it is not the purpose of this thread / comment to remind people of that sad fact . It would take at least a book to explain the history of neglect of French film classics during the last 30 years . ( Benoit A Racine , IMDb user and French cinema connoisseur ) Unless the glacier may give back its prey . . . . the fusty Cahiers du Cinema doesn't . But who knows ? Some day , some French cine buff will give a chance to " La Fille Aux Yeux Gris " and discover that Fred Zinnemann's " five days one summer " ( 1982 ) took its most mind-boggling idea from a forgotten obscure black and white French flick . Like in " Service De Nuit " , the screenplay is brilliantly written , but with better results . All the characters are vividly depicted whereas , with the exception of two of them , the heroes of Faurez's debut were rather flat . Sometimes melodramatic , sometimes wonderfully romantic ( I'm waiting for a rendezvous ; If I am not here anymore , you'll meet her ) , sometimes a movie of redemption ( the last lines for once do not concern the youth , but an old couple , sort of something like " Should I fall behind , please wait for me " ) , and even a detective story ( probably the least satisfying side of the movie ) Fernand Ledoux is the stand out of the movie , in a much more interesting part than in Faurez's Poesque " Histoires Extraordinaires " which is , of the four Faurez movies I had the opportunity to watch , the weakest . Faurez's talent has never had fair recognition ; let's hope that someday , it will . Like this ? try these . . . .

584324	1219578	91616	8.0	Beate Klarsfeld : a heroine of our time .	Directed by Lindsay-Hog many users know as the man who directed the ill-fated ( but absorbing ) " let it be " starring the Beatles . Based on Beate Klarsfeld's true story , an admirable woman who discovered the horrors of the holocaust . A lawyer , but a non-Jew , abetted by her ( Jewish ) husband , she would dedicate her efforts to find the war criminals , which would lead to the arrest of Klaus Barbie . Some people complained because they cast Farah Fawcett , a sex symbol and an ex-Charlie's angel as the lead . But the actress displays determination and resilience . Her best scene is when she's alone on the streets in Brazil and tries to urge the people to help her catch a man " who killed women and children during WW2 " . An above average made-for-TV work . Its current rating of 7 , 3 is well deserved .
583940	1219578	43606	8.0	Cops and robbers , it's all the same .	I have always thought that Italian comedies were far superior to French ones . They all have a tragical side , which eludes the French directors . " Guardie e Ladri " is along chase between a two-bit crook and a cop with a tender heart . The first scene when the lad pretends he is a guide and shows to the naive tourist Colombus's grave and Poppea's bathtub is sheer genius . If it were not enough , the guide finds an " inestimable " coin , a sesterce from Augustus ' time ! The depiction of the two families , the cozy house of the cop where the girl plays the piano and the seedy small flat where the runaway packs into with his large family rings true . Actually Monicelli calls the establishment into question : unemployment , poverty , plenty of mouthes to feed , can we really blame the thief ? The last picture is revealing .
583965	1219578	105260	8.0	the department store around the corner	Prior to treasures like " un Air De Famille " ( 1996 ) or " l'Auberge Espagnole " ( 2002 ) and for his very debut movie , Cédric Klapisch chose to plump for the world of work and to illustrate this statement : how to put forward the human dignity of workers in an economical world driven by the laws of supply and demand ? The " little nothings " in question represent all the employees in the department store and in spite of its demeaning character , the title of the film has nothing of a downer . Nor its contents . On the contrary , Klapisch will take a basket of employees to describe them in a colorful manner . However , they are likely to be redundant for the department store " les Grandes Galeries " is going to close down if it doesn't deliver profitable results . So , the new manager Mr . Lepetit ( Fabrice Luchini ) decides to boost business again by highlighting human and social values revolving around communication , friendliness and good mood among the employees and towards the customers . All this to generate a more playful , more laid-back vibe and this manager isn't afraid to go further by inciting his staff to take part collectively in intense psychoanalytic sessions , lessons to properly smile or individual sports like bungee jumping . . . It's only his first movie but the Klapisch touch is already palpable on the screen . To film these " little nothings " who are individual members of a group , the filmmaker developed a great proximity with them , making himself almost their accomplice . He also handles his camera in a subtle way like this traveling going from Vanessa and then moving high to give a general view of the big , versatile shop . To write his film with Jackie Berroyer , the filmmaker spent days in the same department store to capture a day work of an employee . It's evident on the screen . Nothing is false and a good proportion of the scenes ring true . Klapisch's own approach of the comedy is already there : his film is filled with gags , droll cues which could be models of the art of absurd and nonsense such as : " I don't like relaxing music , it irritates me " and quirky scenes . I relish the one in which a vigilante arrests a young thief and takes him in a room in which another one of his partners is already there and eventually , the two vigilantes bicker themselves instead of punishing the young boy ! And some characters have special name . The name of the manager Lepetit means " little " in French . It's a sharp contrast for a man who is broad-minded and vivacious ! And Jean-Pierre Darroussin's name is " Domrémy " : the link of three musical notes . An adequate name for a seller in a musical instruments shop . If this Klapisch film is of the right bottle , it's because it shelters a formidable weapon : honesty . So , why not testing it ? And just like the grand Hitchcockian tradition or like a painter signs his or her work in a corner of the painting , the filmmaker has a cameo to earmark his work . Guess without looking at the cast of this film on this site when Klapisch appears . . .
583835	1219578	154389	8.0	Cynical	Writer Reign shows one more time his insightful knowledge of the old French cinema when he hints at Ginette Leclerc and " Le Corbeau " . In fact , both these works were very risqué , osé , taking cynicism to new limits . Noel Roquevert , cast against type , portrays a wicked unscrupulous swindler , far from his usual good-natured characters . Matching him every step of the way is Leclerc's bitch-with-a-sentimental-side : take the scene where she tells Charpin ( and later another dupe ) that his father is terminally ill ; she is so convincing we almost believe her . On the other hand , Stefani is one of the most frightening villains of the French cinema ; he is all the more disturbing as his face is very familiar ( and rather nice ) to the French audience . His organization is a Mafia in miniature : all his collaborators are actually his victims for " he knows so many bad things about them he could send them all to jail whenever he wants to ( and he does actually ; he pretends to help the unfortunate Baron and he hands him over to justice , so to speak . The ending is one of the most inventive of the cinema of the era and is still impressive today . It compares favorably to Kazan's " a face in the crowd " . All these radios which were part of the swindles backfire against the Master . It belongs to the first era of Cayatte's career but it is really unique for it does not look like - with the eventual exception of his remarkable sketch in " Retour A la Vie " - the other ones , which are literary adaptations .
582552	1219578	39512	8.0	They were meant for each other , but . .	Whadaya say Jean Delannoy ain't high culture ? This is Jean-Paul Sartre ! Will this director suffer for eternity from the reputation he got from the " nouvelle vague " clique ? At least an user without bias has already written to tell his admiration for " les jeux sont faits " . " Les jeux sont faits " is an unfairly almost unknown movie in France and elsewhere , sometimes by people who praise such works as " heaven can wait " ( 1943 and 1978 ) , " a matter of life and death " ( Powell , 1946 ) , " une simple formalité " ( Tornatore , circa 1998 ) and even " the sixth sense " ( 1999 ) . Two young people ( Micheline Presle and Marcel Pagliero ) come back from the realm of the Dead because they " were meant for each other " . Their love must overcome everything or else they will have to go back . It might seem easy , but they had not reckoned on there being a society . . . The others . . . In " huis clos " , there's Sartre's famous sentence " l'enfer c'est les autres " ( = hell comes from the other ones " ) She comes from a wealthy milieu , he's a working-class hero . Too many things come between them . " Les jeux sont faits " , from the very beginning . A good editing , an intriguing " paradise " ( ? ) without a single religious touch , the person who facilitates the communication between the two worlds being an ordinary secretary ( a wonderful Marguerite Moreno ) . And the last picture is poetic and , what might seem strange in Sartre's world , leaves some hope to the viewer . Outside the already mentioned works , people who like this should catch " Orphée " ( Jean Cocteau , 1950 ) and , above all , " huis clos " ( Jacqueline Audry , one of the very few women who were directors at the time , 1954 ) .
582717	1219578	30062	8.0	Schoodays were the best days of our life .	This movie was made for all these who feel nostalgic for their schooldays : an insert at the beginning of the movie tells us so . . So it may have been , and if so then , it magnificently succeeds in its purpose . Pierre Very , the scenarist , worked wonders here . Saint-Agil is a boarding - school where three pals have formed a secret society " les chiche-capons " ( I do not even know what it means in my first language ) . One of them is writing a novel which takes the three boys in a world of adventures in Mexico . And there are the teachers ; one of them ( Von Stroheim ) is an alien , probably a German , although he teaches English , and the others do not like him very much . We are in 1938 , and there are hints at war ( " A war is always against the aliens " , a rather dumb teacher says , forgetting the numerous civil wars ) . Pierre Very astutely mixed two stories which seem independent but which will become one towards the ending ( think Hitchcok's " family plot " ) . One concerns the students : two of them disappear , where have they gone ? A mysterious postcard is sent from America . The other deals with the teachers : one of them falls in the stairs : was it an accident , did he jump , or was he pushed ? It's all the more puzzling as the fuses have blown at the same time . And why is there a fork on the floor ? Spoiler : Von Stroheim's presence is very moving . In his part of a misunderstood teacher , he almost outshines Michel Simon , no small feat . The ending , which sees this ( German ? ) teacher join the secret society can be interpreted as a plea for friendship , not only between adults and adolescents but also between nations . End of spoiler " Les disparus de Saint-Agil " , released at the time when the French cinema was at its absolute peak , is one of Christian-Jaque ' s finest films : he tried to repeat the formula ( two stories , a children and an adult one ) in " l'assassinat du père noel " ( 1941 ) which was written by Very too , but it was not as convincing . " Les anciens de Saint-Loup " ( 1950 ) , although featuring different characters , was supposed to be a sequel to " les disparus . . " but the magic was gone and although it retains some charm in the first part , it's finally a disappointment .
583506	1219578	22335	8.0	Welcome to the hotel	" Safe in hell " what a title ! When you watch it , you will agree that the title was thoroughly justified . It was hard to be a hero ( or a heroine ) in Wellman's brilliant movies of the thirties : from the wild boys of the street to Lilly Turner , they all got a raw deal . Gilda leaves a macho world to wind up in another macho world even more awful than the one she left behind . The movie is short ( about 70 minutes ) and there are only two " happy " scenes in the whole story : the " wedding " , a peak of romanticism and restrained emotion , and the short moment when the lovers meet again , a scene very Borzagesque ( there's a similar scene in " street angel " when Janet Gaynor asks the cop for one hour to say goodbye to the one she loves ) . As for the rest , it's a ruthless depiction of hateful males who only know one rule : theirs . The arrival of Gilda in this seedy place could only be filmed in the pre - code Hayes days : those men salivate like Pavlov's dogs , getting an eyeful as Gilda comes up the stairs . Like Tom in " heroes for sale " , Gilda wants to keep her promise ; like him she gave everything ; Tom hits the road and becomes a tramp ; Gilda's fate will be more terrible than his . Another unusual melodrama by one of the past masters of the American cinema of the thirties / forties .
583949	1219578	80700	8.0	Incompreso	It was not the first time Luigi Comencini had tackled childhood ( and it would not be the last ) : " Incompreso " was very moving and unforgettable ; " Pinocchio " was very different from Disney's cartoon ; later in the eighties he would transfer , with great talent , De Amicis's " Cuore " , then redo " Marcellino pan y vino " . Comencini is THE poet of childhood , whose reputation is much greater in France than in his native Italy . Here all the movies I mention above plus " lo Scopone Scientifico " and his " Casanova " are considered art house cinema . Eugenio is a normal sensitive child . He's got a rather rich family but he is a burden for them . The child passes from hand to hand : the parents who both want to start over with another partner , the grandparents who are leaving for Australia , the others who are chic mean bourgeois . . . That a friend of the family leaves the boy alone in the country is actually what the family unconsciously wants to do ! While they are searching for the boy , all the flashbacks - Comencini displays less skill than he would do in " Cuore " however ; besides his cast is weaker - show how selfish adults can become . In direct contrast to that , the director introduces a working class family where the boy finds some comfort thanks to his pal , some kind of Italian Gavroche . That the family should be more interested in the new-born calf than in an unfortunate child who slowly moves away as nobody notices it is not surprising and is still relevant in 2007 . As a teacher , I ' ve sometimes met this kind of child . They are well fed , wear smart clothes , own tons of toys , so they should not be miserable . Luigi Comencini died this year ; it was a major loss for the Italian cinema .
583120	1219578	43164	8.0	Waltzing into darkness	The first thing to bear in mind is that , at the time , Michèle Morgan and Henri Vidal were the ideal French couple for sixteen-year old schoolgirls . They met when they were making " Fabiola " and they got married . Jean Grémillon and Albert Valentin do what they do best : setting a working class milieu against the bourgeois world ; the former had done " Gueule d'Amour " and " Lumière d ' Ete " , the latter had given " l'Entraineuse " and " la Vie de PLaisir " . This is the kind of " cinema-made-in-the-studio " which the Nouvelle Vague used to despise but it is this cinema which had lent credibility to the French films since the thirties . There's a striking contrast between the proles ' places ( the street , the uncle's restaurant , Etienne's bedroom , the small apartment where he thinks he ' ll lead a peaceful life with the woman he adores and their baby girl ) and the excessive luxury of the Voisin-Larive mansion . THe construction of the movie can disconcert the audience cause the director takes us from one world to the other one , without giving any explanations . MIchèle Morgan is the only link between them and it is only little by little that we discover the truth . Etienne ( Henri Vidal ) is a good guy , in the grand tradition of Jean Gabin's parts of " Quai des Brumes " or " Le Jour se Lève " . It is often mooted that Henri Vidal was a limited actor but his naiveté , his human warmth and his handsome smile work wonders here . His hope is to marry Irene who told him she was the Voisin-Larive's chamber maid . Irène ( Morgan ) is married to a rich bourgeois with whom she has no sexual relations . For him , she is a marvelous toy , a statue or a masterpiece , something decorative you can show when you throw a party . When Irene tells him she is pregnant ( by Etienne ) he does not care , he sends her to Switzerland . " I do not need any descendants " he says in a terrifying neuter voice . Jacques , the rich husband is some kind of monster . He is not evil , and the fact that he does not need children is downright disturbing , cause the bourgeois ' s dream is par excellence a dynasty , a boy who will continue his work . But this one seems selfishness itself . When Etienne - who still believes Irene is the chamber maid of the house - tells him his wife is pregnant by him , he finds it rather funny and does not give the game away . Jeanette , the less-than - attractive girl in love with Etienne , is the rejected person we had met in " Pattes Blanches " ( 1948 ) . Played by the same actress ( Arlette Thomas ) , she epitomizes hope against hope , she is a Cinderella whose pumpkin never turns into a horse-drawn coach . Both those heroines ( Jeanette and " Pattes Blanches " ' s young hunchback girl ) have a similar fate . Both think that a dress can make the job done , both were born to cry . This cinema-in-the-studio which I mention is often dazzling : there's a sublime shot of a prostrated desperate Morgan while a train is whistling and a hearse down there is crossing the street , a scene to rival the best of Sirk ( there's a similar scene in " a time to love and a time to die " ) . Those carols ( " Gloria in Excelsis Deo " ) become something as obscene as the dazzling Xmas decorations ( one finds the same refinement in the final scenes in the castle in " Pattes Blanches " ) when a child is dying . Those bourgeois , dancing in their luxury mansion , waiting for the clock which's going to strike twelve , is really a sickening sight . " There are so many ways to die " Irene says to Jeanette , and then , back home , she begins her waltz into darkness .
583445	1219578	104756	8.0	The miracle workers	It's impossible to remain indifferent to this family's sufferings . Susan Sarandon and Nick Nolte - in spite of his fake Italian accent - give superlative performances . That moment when Nolte is crying in his stairs is one of the most harrowing desperate scene I have ever seen . What's really extraordinary is that we do not always side with the parents . Sometimes , we think they are monsters to carry on a pointless fight . Sometimes we think that maybe the nurse who reads the fairy tale as if she were reading grocery's lists might be right . Two people who did not know anything about biology ( aside from what we learn in high school ) and who become capable of arguing against leading medical experts after studying books night after night deserve our undivided attention . " Laurenzo " is not an easy movie to watch ; it's not what you would call " entertaining " . For this family , the famous sentence " life is a daily struggle " takes on a terrible meaning . Recommanded .
584169	1219578	424136	8.0	Who's afraid of the big bad wolf ?	" Hard Candy " is a terrifying Huis Clos , a drama in camera , with only two characters on the " stage " ; few movies can say the same : " sleuth " by Mankiewicz ( 1972 ) and " Heaven knows Mr Allison " ( 1957 ) come to mind ; but their very subjects have nothing to do with " hard candy " . " Hard Candy " is about pedophilia but it's a million miles away from your average TV series . If you choose to watch it , be prepared for something you have never seen before . All you need to know is this : a fourteen-year-old girl follows a man she suspects to be a pedophile into his house where . . . The picture are not really atrocious , but the lines are . . . So terrible that the viewer often feels like putting his fingers in his ears . The work seems more European than American : the construction and the editing recall François Ozon's " Gouttes D'Eau Sur Pierres Brûlantes " and the unbearable atmosphere compares favorably with that of Haneke's " funny games " , a Haneke who would have discovered " moral " for " hard candy " is primarily a " moral " movie . " I'm all the little girls who were your preys " a girl disguised as the Little Red Riding Hood says before disappearing into nowhere . To write that Ellen Page and Patrick Wilson are outstanding is to state the obvious . So horrendous were the chances taken by the two thespians that , with any lesser talent , the result could have been disastrous . " Hard Candy " is a movie you've got to watch immediately , but be warned : you need a strong stomach , particularly if you are a man .
583379	1219578	74860	8.0	typical thriller of the seventies	Along with " Midnight Cowboy " ( 1969 ) , this is John Schlesinger's most important work in a rather undistinguished filmography . Although they belong to two distinct genres , these two works have some common points : the same backdrop New York , the same main actor , Dustin Hoffman , here hires for another type of character . The 1969 film had seen him in the shoes of a little miserable Italian emigrant who suffered from TB . The second film gives him the role of a student , " Babe " haunted by the suicide of his father caused by McCarthysm . His thesis about the abuses of power in American political history seems less prominent to his eyes than the marathon for which he intensely trains . A solitary life which will be interrupted by an infernal chain of foreboding mishaps . They revolve around a conspiracy involving a former Nazi criminal , Szell ( Laurence Olivier ) nicknamed the " white devil of Auschwitz " . Babe finds himself in the throes of darkness , wrestling with unforgiving , formidable evil forces whose motivations and goals are elusive to him . " Marathon Man " is a representative film about a trend which developed in the seventies : the conspiracy cinema fueled by generalized suspicion and an increasing paranoia . Just check works such as " the Parallax View " ( 1974 ) by Alan J . Pakula or " Three Days of the Condor " ( 1975 ) by Sydney Pollack . From a fragmented , meandering master plan elaborated by William Goldman , John Schlesinger captures a discomforting climate of fear and paranoia which increase throughout Babe's struggle in the darkness . The director has also the aptitude to generate eerie feelings from sequences shrouded with a muted anxiety . Helped by a brutal editing , an invisible , impending threat hangs over the film and will sooner or later catch Babe up . To puzzle more the audience , Schlesinger muddies the waters and one of his cunning tricks is to delay as much as possible the clarification and the denouement of this apparently convoluted story to make this unsettling atmosphere last . For a major part of the film , the different parts of the puzzle remain separated but to piece them together and so to decipher the story , the viewer will have to be patient just like Babe . He's caught in a spiral of unnerving events which go beyond him and his immature behavior inconveniences the audience , perhaps more than Szell and his henchmen . Before having made the acquaintance of Elsa , Babe tried to flee from reality but is finally caught up by it . To blur the picture , Schlesinger and Goldman tap numerous possibilities of the suspense genre . Illusions and lies abound in the film under different forms : the image " Doc " gives to Babe , the moment when he sneaks into Babe's cramped flat to test his reactions , Babe's false release from Szell's clutches . Schlesinger's directing is laced with effective suspenseful scenes but about the notorious torture sequence with dental surgery instruments , I have never found it really creepy and doesn't live up to its reputation . A character will hint at it in a droll sequence in " Serial Mom " ( 1994 ) by John Waters . On the other hand , the scene is somewhat intense when Olivier asks to Hoffman : " is it safe ? " . One of the best sequences of the film shows him in Madison Avenue where he is recognized by former prisoners and no one seems to care about the woman's shouts . This scene rings true . On the other hand , the film includes weaknesses to bridge the steps of the story like the moment when Babe asks his scoffing neighbors to pretend to burglarize his flat to give him his clothes and his gun . And while I'm on the possible drawbacks of the film , Schlesinger's directing doesn't exclude some easy effects . But they are of minor importance . Even if he's credible as an immature , brazen student , Dustin Hoffman was a little too old for the role . To think that the same year , he acted a clear-sighted journalist , Carl Bernstein in Alan J . Pakula's compelling " All the President's Men " . Beside him Laurence Olivier is brilliant as usual and the two secondary actors , Roy Scheider and Marthe Keller confer to their characters mysterious , opaque dimensions . This is a legion suspenseful movie of the right bottle .
582939	1219578	46949	8.0	The great lost epic .	It came before " the ten commandments " " land of the Pharaohs " " Ben Hur " and it's overlooked today . How unfair ! Based on Mika Waltari's mammoth novel , it doesn't cheapen it ! Waltari's novel was so huge only a miniseries could have done it justice ( I hope it will be done some day ) . Waltari , whose message is essentially Christian remains intact ( another of his books " the secret of the kingdom " ( first part ) takes place after Christ's death in the Holy Land ) . " The Egyptian " is the rising of a monotheism close to Christianism long before Christ : the Pharaoh ( Wilding ) is some kind of Messiah who sacrifices his life because he knows that the true kingdom is not in the material world : he asks to return good for evil ! And he has disciples , who will eventually turn into martyrs ( the scene when Simmons and the other worshippers of the Sun God are slain is visually stunning , looking like some pagan ballet ) . For the priests , on the other hand , this new religion would mean the end of their influence on the populace , and that's why they look for a strong man ( Mature ) who can lead the army against the Hittites as well as against their dangerous compatriots . Another religion , or non-religion should we say , is Sinouhé's ( Purdom ) who during two hours believes in nothing ( the sequence of the grain of sands is absolutely sensational and rises the whole movie well above the average peplum ! ! ) There's another fascinating side : the movie looks like a flamboyant melodrama . Not only for the screenplay ( notably pharoah's sister's ( Tierney ) final revelation which predates " the ten commandments " by two years ) , but also the splendor of the cinematography : Viviani , in his book about Curtiz , talks about a Baudelairian atmosphere , blue and gold , notably in the scenes which involve the prostitute ( Darvi ) who contemplates her reflection in the water of her bath , supreme narcissism . Around the hero , all the characters appear , disappear , appear again , but when they reappear , they have followed their way and all the subplots come together with consummate skill . Besides , as such is often the case in " modern " melodramas , the story is a long flashback , framed by two short sequences showing Sinouhé an old man who's remembering . This is a wonderful sword and sandals , that had a strong influence , not only in America but also in Europa , notably in Poland where Jerzy Kawalerowicz directed a spellbinding " faraon " ( 1966 ) which owed a lot to Curtiz .
583701	1219578	77294	8.0	Too late for the heroes	This movie came one year too late . " Star Wars " happened , for better or for worse , depending on whom you ask . This is clever sci-fi , very close to Crichton's work , before he gets bogged down in Jurassic Park and spielbergesque follies . ( " Mondwest " " Coma " and later " looker " ) Is it sci-fi anyway ? Admittedly , it's unlikely as hell , but not much more than many a spy thriller . In the movie , this whole performance was to make people believe the astronauts actually landed on Mars . This trickery , isn't it what Peter Hyams ( and all other directors ! ) does when he makes his movie ? His whole performance is to make US believe that Astronauts are to land on Mars but . . . They do it with mirrors , like Jorge Luis Borges . The second part of the movie is a chase , a well done thriller , in landscapes recalling " Planet of the apes ( 1968 ) " . Hyams does not show the killings , and the way James Brolin manages to show the way to his wife , then to journalist Gould is pretty smart . The ending verges on black humor . Had this movie been released five or ten years sooner , when sci-fi had strong scripts , it would have been deservedly acclaimed . But in the land of special effects and childish stories , it became a sleeper , every sci-fi buff should know . Neither " outland " ( some kind of remake of " high noon " on Jupiter ) , nor " 2010 " ( which failed dismally as a " 2001 " sequel ) is on a par with " capricorn one " .
582309	1219578	40338	8.0	Through a child ' s eye , darkly . . . .	When you are a child , you often hope you will live absorbing adventures and that the fairy tale you are reading will come true . When you are , like the hero of Carol Reed's movie , an only child , cause your father is a VIP , you have a tendency to build your own world and to invent your own heroes who might have killed some day , but in self-defense only , and in a faraway country . Mrs Baines is the witch , Mr . Baine is the hero any child would dream of , and his lover , Michele Morgan has all it takes to be an heroine : she's beautiful , she's tender and she's a foreigner ; moreover , she ' s French and she and the little boy are the only ones who can speak fluent French ! This is an absorbing story , where we are told that a child does not take the same view as you do , and that playing a game with him or pretending to be or to do can prove to be dangerous . The paper plane ( a telegram ) scene can compare with Hitchcock's best tricks ; there's a similar scene in " Spellbound " . This is one of the best films with a child as the hero . Like this ? Try these . . . L'incompreso ( Luigi Comencini , 1966 ) Hunted ( Charles Crichton , 1952 ) Jeux Interdits ( René Clément , 1952 ) Moonfleet ( Fritz Lang , 1955 )
584186	1219578	86551	8.0	François Truffaut's successful swansong	As I have often pointed out in several reviews , François Truffaut is far from being prominent in my canon of favorite French filmmakers of all time . I have always thought that he was one of the most overrated ones and he contributed in making me hate the New Wave and its pretensions . " Les 400 coups " ( 1959 ) is a very academic work . " Jules et Jim " ( 1962 ) has not worn very well and its innovative camera work couldn't conceal the extreme unlikeliness of the story . I also pass in silence the Antoine Doinel saga starring stiff Jean-Pierre Léaud . However , there are some palatable flicks in Truffaut's filmography : " l'Enfant Sauvage " ( 1970 ) , a very harrowing , sensitive work , " l'Argent De Poche " ( 1976 ) , a delightful children's realm and this one " Vivement Dimanche ! " ( 1983 ) , his last opus before he passed away the following year . It was not the first time , Truffaut had tried a stab at handling the detective genre . " Tirez Sur Le Pianiste " ( 1960 ) , " la Mariée Etait en noir " ( 1968 ) , " la Sirène Du Mississippi " ( 1969 ) gave so-so results but " Vivement Dimanche " ! " is far more gripping and enjoyable than the three quoted films . An estate agent , Julien Vercel ( Jean Louis Trintignant ) is suspected of having murdered his wife and his lover . He has to hide in his workplace and her secretary Barbara ( Fanny Ardant ) investigates about this mystery and leads her to reconstitute Barbara's murky past . Julien confides to Barbara that he knew very well his wife but in the same time , he didn't want to know her hidden face . He'll however discover it . With his 21st long-feature movie , Truffaut wanted to pay a tribute to one of his masters , Sir Alfred Hitchcock and also to the detective films with which he grew up . The Truffaut insiders surely know that he was a big fan of the master of suspense , in the 1960's , Truffaut published a book in which through a series of interviews , he related the work he did in his prestigious filmography . In our present movie , Hitchockian references are evident with , for example winks at " Rear Window " ( 1954 ) ( Truffaut's favorite film from Hitchcock ) or " Dial M For Murder " ( 1954 ) . And some objects play a vital role for the evolution of the plot like in some Hitchcock's works : the telephone among others . Truffaut's movie conciliates two sub genres of the detective film : the whodunit and the film noir ( the film takes place in the south of France where it is usually sunny , but here quite a lot of scenes takes place at night ) enjoys a solidly structured plot with the usual ingredients of the genre : wrong culprit , shady places , a gripping investigation with the scattering of clues revealing Barbara's past and leading to the resolution of the plot . Actually , one could have an inkling about Barbara's and her lover's murderer . What matters is why he killed them . Then Truffaut's work is also served with genteel camera work and especially there's humor which isn't in general his forte . But here , it works . My favorite moment would be ( when Barbara is in front of the brothel : a passer-by : " Excuse me . How Much ? " Barbara : " Pardon ? " " How much ? " , " it's twenty-five to eight " . And of course , Truffaut couldn't make a work without inserting movie-loving details . The cinema plays the Stanley Kubrick film : " Paths of Glory " ( 1958 ) . The cast ? It's immaculate . Fanny Ardant ( Mrs Truffaut at the time ) is excellent as well as Jean Louis Trintignant . But the rest of the cast doesn't stay on the bench . Each actor who acts a colorful character makes his or her part count . What is puzzling is that Truffaut hated Sundays . It's mysterious why he entitled his last movie with something he disliked . Was he contemplating retirement ? Perhaps not since after , he wrote the script for " la Petite Voleuse " which was about to be directed by Claude Miller in 1988 with gratifying results . But Fanny Ardant sighs in the film : " I can't wait to be on Sunday " . It's true that in the film , it's a complete change of life . She acts more like a detective than a secretary and it may be grueling to try to resolve a mystery . So , Sunday is eagerly awaited . Anyway , Truffaut began his cinema career with an overrated work , " les 400 coups " . He will have ended it with a buoyant one .
584447	1219578	49010	8.0	The Father	Although referring to cortisone , " Bigger than life " is rayesque to the core . Davey ( " Run for cover " ) Plato and Jim ( " rebel without a cause " ) and the Chinese girl ( " 55 days at Peking " ) were in search of a father . Even the Jeff / Wes relationship in " lusty men " is of the same kind . Cortisone is just an alibi . The subject of the film is the paternal power . And this father is also a teacher ! The PTA meeting is revealing ! Richie has got a father . But there's a crack in the mirror ( Ed's broken reflection is the key to the movie ) . Little by little , we feel there's something irrational in his attitude . Buying clothes , It's very natural ! Playing football with your sonny , is a right thing to do to be good friends . But , thanks to James Mason's sensational performance , we feel ill-at-ease , even scared . This fear will culminate in the arithmetic lesson where Mason ' s shadow on the wall is terrifying ( when Barbara Rush enters the room , see her tiny shadow ! it's a lesson in directing a movie ) . And being a father is not far from being a God . After hearing again in the church the prodigal son story , it's only natural in Ed's case to feel like Abraham . ( His final dream - which we do not see - is extraordinary ) . It might be a warning against pills , drugs and all that stuff . But I rather think it's a warning against " overeducation " . As a teacher , I heard about a student's father who spent a WHOLE Saturday afternoon to make sure his unfortunate son did understand the multiples . Superb performance by James Mason ( the scene when his face suddenly appears in the mirror as his boy is searching his room is really spooky ) , good support from Barbara Rush , Walter Matthau and young Christopher Olsen .
582905	1219578	259440	8.0	Inconnu Au Bataillon	Here's another eloquent example of an actress who decided to show her potential as a female director : Zabou Breitmann also known as Zabou , full stop . The topic of her premier film gives the inkling that she doesn't fear thorny subjects . Indeed , Alzeihmer's disease and the loss of memory are rather way off cinema's radar . But it's a film to remember which is also a prime example that love can be strong and survive to any disease . " Se Souvenir Des Belles Choses " is split into two parts . The first one takes place in the institution for people with troubled memory . Before the anticipated meeting between the two lovers that Zabou delays , she takes her time to relate and describe life conditions in this institution for the sick people and the team of doctors and nurses . She delivers a not so despondent and warm description of this place and grants a meaty place to humor and tenderness . The second part starts with the returning of Christine and Philippe in the normal world and as the latter bit by bit recovers his memory , Christine's disease gathers pace and makes her lose her marks and collapse . These are two parts that follow each other and complement themselves . The serious problem of Alzeihmer's disease is explored without tawdry fascination or unhealthy complacency but with a minimum of objectivity and lucidity . A good proportion of sequences or details directly or indirectly linked to it ring true like the instructions left on the white board or recorded on a tape for Christine or in the institution with these strips of colors indicating the way to specific places . Zabou also didn't forget the people's dangerous behaviors facing sick people with Alzeihmer's disease . See the sequence in the supermarket when Christine's mother gives her a meeting in a precise place and poor Christine loses herself . Zabou was right to give the main role to Isabelle Carré whose role propelled her in the restrained circle of the new young luminaries of contemporary French cinema alongside Sylvie Testud among others . She gives a startling performance supported by Bernard Campan who managed to make me forget that he was once part of this irresistible comic trio the Inconnus . For their fans , who could have thought among them that he was able to act a man at a loss with a great credibility whereas he was so far usually typecast in comical roles ? The female director Zabou relegated herself in a secondary role of analyst and her love affair with the director acted by Bernard Le Coq is one of the tiny glitches her film shelters which make it ( the film ) impossible to reject . This is one to remember .
583345	1219578	42286	8.0	Poetic , elegiac , wonderful .	The movie is in the past conditional , because we know the real end of the story and Delmer Daves who had been studying the Indians ways for a long time did not try to fool the audience : " broken arrow " is not a nice " peace and love " movie : there are plenty of death , violence and hatred here , more than in the average western . As Cochise says , living in peace is more difficult than waging war . But Jeffords and him become legendary figures whom we can still meet today everywhere in the world , peace on earth and good will to men . Thus his story becomes universal . There's a wistful , not to say very sad side : Delmer Daves is like John Lennon singing " imagine " or Neil Young singing " Pocahontas " ( I wish I was a trapper / I would give a thousand pelts / To sleep with Pocahontas / And find out how she felt / In the morning in the fields of green / in the home land we've never seen ) : he does know that all these promises are illusive , the two protagonists trust each other , but who else can they trust ? The dice are loaded from the start . That's why the love scenes are so important and among the most visually astounding we can see in a western . Thanks partly to Debra Paget's breathtaking beauty , the scenes between Jeffords and Sonseearhay climax the movie . They give the audience a taste of a lost paradise " the homeland we've never seen " : Jefford's dream only really comes true in these sequences where the lovers are under the " big sky " in communion with nature . Some will complain because everybody speaks English , but Tom's voice-over warns us from the very start . Kevin Costner , who makes his Oscar-winning " dance with wolves " in the early nineties , owes a good deal to Delmer Daves .
585090	1219578	41738	9.0	Anouilh and Grémillon .	Immediate background : Jean Anouilh who wrote the screenplay was to direct the movie but he fell sick and had to give up . He chose Jean Grémillon , one of the great directors of the golden age of the FRench cinema ( 1935-1945 ) to do the job and he was right . Jean Grémillon gathered a splendid cast including Paul Bernard , as the fallen aristocrat ( " Pattes Blanches " ) , Fernand Ledoux , Suzy Delair at her bitchiest , and - the Chabrol fans will notice it - a very young Michel Bouquet as the squire's doomed brother , Sylvie and Arlette Thomas . This latter actress is completely forgotten today , but her part brings some hope in a desperate - most of Anouilh's plays are - story . Her character , a hunchback whom Odette ( Delair ) despises , resembles Cinderella , a miserable Cinderella ( check the admirable sequence in the castle ) . Another memorable scene shows the noble , on the edge of the cliff , holding Odette's bridal veil . Don't let the current rating fool you . " Pattes Blanches " , with its distraught lyricism , is a must .
584224	1219578	38975	9.0	I'm glad you couldn't .	" Spiral Staircase " was the horror masterpiece Robert Siodmak had always threatened to make . In 1939 , " Pièges " his last French movie and his finest - remade by Douglas Sirk as " lured " introduced the unusual places , the eerie atmosphere ( Von Stroheim's house ) . In 1944 , " Phantom Lady " from the great William Irish introduced the psychokiller . In 1946 , " the Dark Mirror " would continue the Freudian vein , which " Spiral staircase " had begun . It was not the first time a film had displayed Freudian accents . At the time , all the thrillers directors ( Fritz Lang , Alfred HItchcock ) had their movie dealing with psychoanalysis . Of course it's dated now . Almost all these catharsis revealed something buried in infancy / childhood . Even the " serious " works such " snake pit " were no exceptions . The black and white cinematography is stunning , dazzling , making the whole film a feast for the eye . If Siodmak takes the easy way out for his killer's identity , all that surrounds him is splendid indeed : Dorothy McGuire , in a theater , watching a silent movie ( she is a mute girl ) , while horrible things happen in a room upstairs , things not alike the conclusion of the movie and a sinister omen of events to come ; the ( Gothic , of course ) mansion where scared people flattens themselves after dark ; the park where the whispering trees generate fear ; the cellar where the pages of a book become an impending menace ; this extraordinary dreamlike sequence where MacGuire sees her wedding and this voice which keeps on repeating " Say : I do ! " ; the staircase , the central place of the story where the plot is resolved . " Spiral staircase " is essential viewing for anyone interested in thrillers . Remake by Peter Collinson in 1975 with Jacqueline Bisset . Like this ? Try these : - the three other Siodmak movies I mention . - " Mute witness " Anthony Waller 1994
584737	1219578	266697	9.0	an apparently trivial story transcended in a stylish treatment	" One of these days , I'm going to cut you into little pieces " ( Pink Floyd , One of These Days , Meddle , 1971 ) . I have often written in some reviews on this site that I wasn't a big fan of Quentin Tarantino , a cinema-going filmmaker with a mind-boggling culture . It's true that I have never been very taken with " Pulp Fiction " ( 1994 ) . As for " Kill Bill : Vol . 1 " , I had deemed it as " violent and hollow " . I maintain the first epithet but I jettison the second one now . I watched it again last Saturday night with its other brother " Kill Bill : Vol . 2 " ( that I hadn't seen before ) and I changed my mind about it . I realized that I had overlooked it and I would go as far as saying that I found it much better than Tarantino 1994 film . The staple story doesn't carry much weight . A wedding in the desert takes a tragic dimension when all the guests are killed except the Bride who spends four years in a coma . When she wakes up , she's got one sole word in her mind : revenge . On a scrap of paper , she noted down the names of the ones who made of her wedding a tragedy and is well determined to kill them all . She also keeps the best for the end : Bill . This story is for Tarantino almost a pretext to beef it up with sources coming from different horizons : comic strip , spaghetti western , samurai film and even video games in the elaboration of the fight sequences . And animated by a cinema passion , the filmmaker couldn't resist to the desire to include film-loving details throughout the Bride's adventures . Thus , the title of the second chapter is entitled if my memory serves me well : " the Bride wore blood " . It's of course a hint at François Truffaut's film , " la Mariée Etait en Noir " ( 1968 ) , a film on which Truffaut himself didn't have a warm spot . I have just mentioned the term chapter since the film and its companion are divided into chapters and Tarantino isn't afraid of subverting storytelling conventions by showcasing chapters in a chronological disorder like his previous efforts . The technical command of " Kill Bill : Vol 1 . " leaves speechless . First , I would like to congratulate Tarantino for the cinematography he tapped . It enhances bright colors , especially the red and one thing I noticed : in the first sequence of the film , Uma Thurman drives a vehicle with red seats . In Jean-Luc Godard's " Pierrot Le Fou " ( 1965 ) , the red is also a dominating color . In one scene , Jean Paul Belmondo and Anna Karina are in a car with red seats . If I don't understand at all the symbolical function of the red in Godard's highbrow work , in Tarantino's work , his symbolic is blatant according to the story and the Bride's motivations . Red is revenge , violence , death . This revenge story is filmed with virtuosity to its recesses where nothing is left to chance . It's tempting to deem the introduction of some characters as filler but it's necessary to reveal and consolidate their persona . And throughout these chapters , Tarantino taps all the cinematographic possibilities to bestow and embellish the form to the service of his intentions ( to pay homage to the samurai film among others ) and the contents . Thus , one of the moments of the film is showcased under the form of a Japanese cartoon film and for perhaps one of the most momentous moments ( the scene when the BRie kills some 80 masked enemies , Tarantino borrowed a device from Hitchcock he used in his mind-boggling " Psycho " ( 1960 ) : to shot an incredibly violent fight sequence in black and white not to show the red blood . Besides and while I'm on this sequence as well as the others that involve fights , they are so well choreographed and set with clockwork precision that they can emulate , even outclass the ones of " the Matrix " saga . And as many film buffs know it , one of Tarantino's recognizable signs is his pronounced taste for bloody violence . For " Kill Bill : Vol . 1 " , he didn't shelve it but this violence is virtually all blood and thunder and watching ripped or pierced body parts or whole bodies , slashed arms and legs becomes highly great fun . Thrill-seekers will be overjoyed and the height is reached when the Bride before facing Lucy Liu declares to them : " don't try to get back your missing parts ! " . Tarantino even grants some importance to some apparently trivial things like for instance the Japanese man who sells to the Bride a clean saber writes on the mist of a window , the one whom the Bride wants to get rid of at the end of her list ( you guessed who it is of course ) or when the Bride tries to move her big toe after her coma . It's exciting cinema as one could wish and for Tarantino whose target was partly to pay homage to the samurai movies with which he grew up , he delivered the goods : to spend a truly great cinema moment . The different cinematographic devices and tricks interlock with easiness and fluidity . What about my judgment of the volume 2 ? The answer in my review about it . NB : there's perhaps this unlikeliness in Tarantino's scenario . When the Bride gets out of the hospital and finds herself in the underground parking , thirteen hours pass by before she can feel her feet again . But during this time the staff at the hospital must have realized her departure . Why don't they find her again after such a long time ? It's a minor detail .
584727	1219578	61376	9.0	Robert Enrico's second masterpiece .	. . . the first one being the unsurpassed " Au Coeur De La Vie " Released when the nouvelle vague was à la mode and when critics did not care for the others ( = who were not part of the Godard clique ) , " les adventurers " has stood the test of time remarkably well , so well that ( God preserve us ) some producers could think of a remake . Robert Enrico had already directed " les grandes gueules " ( 1963 ) which enhanced male friendships in a Vosges Mountains sawmill and is still watchable today thanks to its good cast ( Bourvil , Lino Ventura , Marie Dubois ) , and Enrico's efficient directing . But nothing could have predicted " les adventurers " , which seems today stronger than yesterday , when so many nouvelle vague " oeuvres " are reserved for highbrows and make too many people take to their heels when they hear about French cinema . " Les adventurers " was based on the first part of a Jose Giovanni novel ( who had written Becker's " le trou " ; Giovanni himself transferred the second part to the screen as " la loi du survivant " ) . When it was released , it was a huge popular success , but the critics were a bit condescending . The Delon / Ventura / Shimkus threesome shines . They are true raiders , in a way Indiana Jones is not : they have something to lose , and they are human beings of flesh and blood . Enrico used the film sets to stunning results . He makes the scrap heap where Leatitia looks for waste material as poetic as the fort surrounded by the sea where the tragedy is resolved . François de Roubaix's extraordinary score enhances the scenes as few musicians can do . The burial at sea is the most beautiful sequence of the sixties French cinema . I cannot think of a more haunting scene : anybody who has seen it never forgets it . Robert Enrico , who is not regarded as an " important " director in France has nothing to be jealous of his peers here . A work to rival the best of Huston .
585455	1219578	59043	9.0	The crowning of Wyler's career	In the sunny , too sunny country , very nasty things happen . A young man goes chasing butterflies which he kills and adds to his collection . But there's more . . . William Wyler , unfairly deemed " academic " , gave with " the collector " his most sustained piece of work in the sixties . With the impressive exception of " best years of our lives " ( 1945 ) , it might simply be his very best movie . He really took to new limits the psychological drama in huis clos he had already tackled in the past ( little foxes ( 1941 ) , the heiress ( 1949 ) , detective story ( 1951 ) ; desperate hours ( 1955 ) ) But none of these strong works equal " the collector " : they often verge on melodrama , convention and sentimentality . None of these setbacks show up in the 1965 work : it's definitely a modern one , ahead of its time , and of which any great director of the planet would be proud . Using only two characters - John Huston did it before in " heaven knows , Mr Allison " ( 1957 ) , but with less startling effects-Wyler sustains interest and suspense till the very end . And I would go as far as saying that the ending prolongates the suspense , because it's an incredible conclusion , thoroughly immoral ( I really wonder why the censorship did not ask Wyler to " sweeten " it ) Terence Stamp is the collector , and he's probably never been better than in this deadly story . Not only he predates Hannibal , copycats , bone collectors and co for three decades , but he runs the whole gamut of emotions : this character was unique for the time , with only Karl-Heinz Boehm's " peeping tom " character ( 1960 ) as a contender . He is a socially washout , an obscure clerk , his colleagues ' laughing stock , his only family is a ridiculous auntie , no future prospects , no love of his own , alife unfulfilled to a fault . To think that it takes the director a one - minute black and white flashback to let us know about his hero's background ! Matching him every step of the way is Samantha Eggar's sensational portrayal of Miranda , the young girl he kidnaps and holds in a cellar . She's his prisoner , but he's a prisoner too : of his phantasms , obsessions . The young man suffers in his flesh and his mind , in spite of his impassive face - Compare Wyler's work with Stamp here with that of Fellini in " spirit of the dead , part 3 " Tobby Dammit " : although Stamp is outstanding in the Italian's work too , he's much more convincing here because the " academic " Wyler remains in control of his actor . What Stamp cannot forgive Miranda , and the whole world outside it the normal , legal , licit , - the society approves of it - , side of her happiness , her " joie de vivre " ( check the first pictures of her ) . Maybe her parents are not that much rich , but her father is a doctor and thanks to him , she's an art student , she's access to culture and to the in crowd , whereas he will always remain a misfit and a dunce . THe " catcher in the rye " sequence reveals the gap between them . The amour fou which Stamp feels for Eggar will remain platonic because he respects her too much - " respects " is the keyword , it comes at every dialogue . But maybe it's because Miranda ' culture puts her on a throne , an inaccessible icon , which makes the epilogue one of the most terrifying ever filmed . The cinematography and Maurice Jarre's music are also brilliant assets for a movie that should be missed on no account . This was to be Wyler's swansong : his last three movies are disappointing : " how to steal a million dollars " is another comedy , " funny girl " a vehicle for B . S . and " the liberation of L . B . Jones " , just exploited the success of " in the heat of the night " " The collector " must be regarded as his artistic testament .
583252	1219578	66318	9.0	A second look at " la rupture " .	" La rupture " might be the best Chabrol . I've recently seen it and I think it has improved a lot with time , more than any other movie of the Chabrol 1967-1973 heyday , even more , in several respects , than " le boucher " or " que la bête meure " . Completely overlooked , there is a lot of Chabrol fans that don't even know the existence of " la rupture " , and the critic-when they know it - has always been condescending . Why is it the best Chabrol ? Because it has almost everything that we find in the director's other works : love , suspense , bourgeoisie contempt , mystery , humor-mostly black - , and even surrealism . Two influences are glaring as far as " la rupture " is concerned : Alfred Hitchcock ' s ( the actor , telling the heroine that the world is a dirty place recalls Uncle Charlie in " shadow of a doubt " ) and Henri-George Clouzot's ( the boarding house recalls " l'assassin habite au 21 " ) The main topic is the power of money ; never Chabrol has been as convincing as here . Michel Bouquet , the accurate prototype of a French bourgeois circa 1970 is terrifying . He's got a wallet by way of heart and he stalks his daughter-in-law as a spider on its web , to get the custody of his grandson . When Audran , desperate , comes back from the airport , two scenes pack a real wallop : the first one shows the reunited couple , desperately trying to pick up the pieces , whereas they know they are bound to fail . Audran and Drouot are harrowing and the spectator wish they could get out of this money pigpen . A second scene , just following this one , shows Audran telling her contempt to the discreet charm of the bourgeoisie . Chabrol is actually speaking out here , and his voice has never been so devastating . There ' s a lot of subplots and never a Chabrol supporting cast has been so important . He achieves a real tour de force : every character is interesting , be it the owner of the boarding-house , her alcoholic husband , her retarded daughter , the three old ladies , the villain ( Machiavellian Jean Pierre Cassel ) , his nymphomaniac accomplice , the good doctor . . . . Money allows very bad things , the right to pervert an innocent child is not the least . The scenes between the villains and Elise , the poor idiot have a contemporary feel . Money allows the over-possessive mother ( an Hitchcockian influence again ) to pick up her beloved child ( in his thirties ! ) , to read him " the knights of the round table " , and to poison him with protection . Money allows to tarnish a brave mother's reputation when she makes her best to cope with her plight . The movie eventually drags down the whole cast for an astounding finale , complete with drugs , deaths , hallucinations ( a bit dated , admittedly ) and the balloon release comes as a relief . Stephane Audran , more than 15 years before " babette's feast " is wonderfully cast as a mother who ' s got to fight for her child and her honor . Her beauty radiates in this filthy world . Once again , " la rupture " contains whole everything that Chabrol had done before and heralds the best that he has done since . It deserves to be restored to favor . NB : It's superior to Charlotte Armstrong's " balloon man " which provided the story . All the names but one ( Sonia ) were Frenchified , Sherry becoming Helene .
584126	1219578	63442	9.0	An all-time sci-fi classic .	Taking some liberties with Pierre Boulle's book , the movie remains faithful to its spirit , to its Voltaire-like irony . It's interesting if you saw the movie to read the book and compare the two endings : desperate at the end of the movie , it's actually tinged with humor in Boulle's words ( Men inspired by wisdom ? Quite impossible ! the astronaut says before we realize it's a monkey ) On the other hand , the fact that , unlike in the book , the apes do not enjoy a modern life with cars is not a problem . I would go as far as saying that it's better that way . Considering the conclusion , the shattering final clue , desolate landscapes and primitive technology are logical , de rigueur . In French junior high schools , pupils frequently study this book and now , thanks to the video , they study the movie in parallel . I saw the movie when it was released and I knew from the start it would become a classic . The final scene , one of the strongest of all sci-fi movies , filmed with an impeccable science of the picture using high and low angle shots , is mind-boggling . It's a movie that cried to be left alone , I'm not sure that Tim Burton ( whom I admire though ) was right to redo .
584960	1219578	41635	9.0	Absolute film noir .	The substantive " Manèges " in French has three meanings : a merry-go-round , a ring ( where you practice horse-riding ) , and ploys . The last two meanings can be applied to Allégret's movie . It does take place in a ring and hateful people are making ploys . Bernard Blier owns the ring , he's a naïve meek man , not the handsome guy women can dream of . Enter Simone Signoret - in one of her most satanic parts - : abetted by a mother ( played by a remarkable Jeanne Marken ) she marries the poor lad , who believes she loves him , and then the plot will become as ruthless as it can be . Signoret's portrayal is extraordinary , and easily matches her sensational roles in " les diaboliques " or " Room at the top " : emptying her hubby's pockets , lying lazily on her bed , horse-riding in the woods , stalking rich preys among chic clients of the " manège " ( because Blier is only a stage on her way to social elevation ) , or laughing at Blier behind his back , with her mother's strident chuckles which come back as a sinister leitmotiv . She does not realize she remains a rather vulgar woman , and the posh people she sees in her husband's ring cannot be fooled . " Your perfume will always be horse-manure ! " , the stable - lad , her lover , tells her . Signoret's mother ( Marken ) is an evildoer to a fault : she acts with her daughter as a madam . Her charms must provide her with money and respectability . The movie is masterfully constructed , using flashbacks , now Blier's memories , now Marken's ones . The ending is so black that the viewer , after this " horse-manure " atmosphere , needs a breath of fresh air . Film noir buffs , do not miss this gem !
583705	1219578	47136	9.0	Mock - western in true color .	Once upon a time , there were great parts for women . . . . Can this be called western ? The form looks like a western , but the content is a thousand miles away from Ford , Daves , Mann . Only Walsh and his psychopathologic heroes ( " pursued " ) can vaguely be Ray's predecessor . This is a gaudy extravaganza , in which trucolor ( sic ) allows extraordinary shots . Vienna's saloon does not look like a saloon at all . When Emma and her acolytes come to hang her , she is sitting in a white dress , playing the piano , against a fire-colored backdrop , she looks like a fallen aristocrat from the court of . . Vienna ? Sometimes the characters merge in the setting ( I'm part of the furniture , one man says ) . Sometimes everything is black , except for Vienna's and Johnny's faces and their dialogue becomes absolutely sublime . In one scene , Crawford repeats mechanically Johnny's words , then , a second time , with more feeling you'll ever know ( Yes , I was waiting for you ) What makes this western unique is the antagonism between the two women . Why does Emma exude hatred from every pore ? Is it because she's a puritan , but a repressed one , who envies Vienna and her bevy of lovers ? Or , most likely , because , she's attracted by her sexually . When Vienna appears , she's all dressed in black , she looks like a man ( one of the male characters say that men are not men compared to her ! ) To Emma , Vienna epitomizes evil , the forbidden fruit , the desire with which she's eaten , so she must die . MCCambridge is on a par with Crawford , and it is a pity she's always given supporting parts elsewhere . Turkey is a typical Ray character too . He's the adolescent , longing to be a man , but who needs the distaff side : when he's injured and asks for Vienna's help , he acts as if she were his mother . We meet again this kind of guy in " Run for cover " ( The couple John Derek / James Cagney try to rebuild the relation father / son ) and in " rebel without a cause " ( S . Mineo wishes N . Wood and J . Dean were his parents ) Turkey and the two other ones will meet tragic , doomed fate . For the final showdown , men take a back seat , and on the stage , only the two women remains . The happy end is tinged with bitterness , as it is in " run for cover " or " rebel without a cause " . Once upon a time there were great parts for women . But it was a long long time ago .
582507	1219578	130827	9.0	run , run , run ( the Velvet Underground ) . . .	The story takes place in Berlin . Manni , one of the two main characters of the movie is in dire straits . Indeed , he works for a dealer and has forgotten a substantial amount of money in the subway ( 100 000 marks ! ) . If he hasn't given this amount to his boss before midday , he is dead . So you can imagine his state . But his girlfriend , Lola is well decided not to give him up and to get him out of this tight spot . And fortunately , she has an idea to find 100 000 marks . But she must be quick . She has only 20 minutes in front of her to get the money and to save her man . Someone who didn't see " Lola rennt " ( 1998 ) and reads the basic topic might think that he deals with a movie with a hackneyed subject . However , if he is told that the treatment is drastically different , then we may incite him to watch this movie and he probably won't regret it . Indeed , following the starting point , the movie puts forward 3 solutions to solve Manni's trouble . Either , Lola's father refuses to lend her money , either Lola holds up the bank , either , she can't get through to her father . So , this will give birth to 3 different stories which will lead to 3 different conclusions . Inside these stories , a detail , a little moment is sufficient to change Lola's running in the street and it can also modify the course of things . For example , when Lola leaves her flat , there's a young man with a dog in the corridor . Will he trip Lola up ? Will she hesitate a moment because of the dog ? Will she jump over it ? If she chooses one of these three solutions , it can lead to dramatic consequences for others characters ( her father's colleague in the car ) . By adopting a clip side " à la MTV " in the making , by using all the possibilities offered by a camera ( succession of pictures filmed in a fast way or scenes in slow motion ) , by including wild extracts of animation film , through precise camera angles " à la David Fincher " and with a sharp sense of detail , the director Tom Tykwer makes us really share her heroin's state of stress and the fact of knowing that to save her boyfriend is a matter of life and death strikes right at the heart . Lola's uneasiness is heightened by the fact that every time she meets someone in the street , odd sometimes spooky thoughts come thick and fast . Rarely has a director has so well combined anxiety and excitation to the spectator . We allow ourselves to be led astray by Lola's unrestrained running with frenzy while bearing in mind , the fear of time which inexorably passes . It is also relevant to note down that Tykwer's camera nearly never stands still and finds moments of break between the three stories when Lola and Manni are lying side by side . Franka Potente with her loud red hair ( which I interpret as a symbol of hope mingled with fear ) in the wind , wearing a tank top spends most of her time to run in the film , hounded by the camera which continually follows her everywhere she goes , either it is a little street , an avenue or a building site but she also capable of emotion ( when her father refuses to give her financial help , she starts to cry ) . Let's just regret heavy effects ( when she screams , she can break glass . A movie with such a treatment was to be destined to make a beautiful career abroad . Lola had run with enormous success on numerous German screens , she had to run on plenty others foreign screens a bit all over the world to satisfy a lot of viewers . The clip side of the whole , the sustained use of the techno music will probably fail to please certain film enthusiasts but will surely perceive " Lola rennt " as a lively and a really great exercise of style . An exciting experience which is worth the trip and after the projection , Lola keeps on running in the mind of the ecstatic spectator .
585238	1219578	49569	9.0	eye for an eye , tooth for a tooth	With hindsight , André Cayatte's golden hour was the 1948-1957 years , this decade which begins with " les Amants de Verone " ( which does not belong to his " legal " era , although in a way it does : aren't the final scenes some kind of trial ) and ends with this film , one of his strongest and one of his harshest . Even the conclusions of " Justice Est Faite " " Avant Le Deluge " or " Nous Sommes Tous Des Assassins " were not that pessimistic ; one has to watch the film made up of sketches " Retour A La Vie " ( segment " Le Retour de Tante Anna " ) ( 1949 ) to find such a blackness . A doctor who has been working all day is having a rest in his home in Lebanon when a man knocks on his door : his pregnant wife is not very well and he asks for help . The exhausted physician has his servant tell the lad to drive to the hospital . On the road , breakdown . When the doctor finally returns to the clinic , his desperate assistant tells him the woman died in the night : ectopic pregnancy . . " If you had been here . . . " . Is the doctor really responsible for this death ? The first part of the film is relatively slow , building little by little an inexorable tension : strange warnings , phone calls , shadows on the wall , flat tires . . . The widower is a little fat man ( Folco Lulli ) who seems harmless . The doctor ( Curd Jurgens ) feels ( and does not ) feel guilt . From the beginning , an insistent threatening atmosphere . By the beginning of the second part ( the " odyssey " in the desert ) , the film is on fire and there is no letup as it continues to build in intensity and drama as the tempers rise and violence and hatred become even greater . The little fat man which seemed ridiculous does not think that revenge is a dish best eaten cold : he wants his revenge and he takes off the " assassin " towards the infinite desert where thirst and despair awaits : " Can you explain to me why thirst is man's worst enemy ? " The feud in the desert is not unlike Von Stroheim's grandiose " greed " . And the final panoramic shot will leave you on the edge of your seat . André Cayatte Truff ' was always putting down was admired by Ingmar Bergman . Can you forget one more time the Nouvelle Vague and enjoy this extraordinary film noir , which deals with blind ( animal ? ) justice without entering a court ?
584813	1219578	36341	9.0	In a word : mind-boggling	This is by far my favorite Val Lewton's production . How can a film be so disturbing , so scary , without any real special effect , without any hackneyed trick and with a shoestring budget . It's impossible to watch " the seventh victim " and not to think of other films yet to come . And what films ! " Psycho " : the scene when Kim Hunter is having a shower predates that of Leigh by more than fifteen years : the ominous shadow behind the curtain , her threatening words . " Rosemary's baby " : it's quite possible Ira Levin was influenced by this film when he wrote his book . Both Polanski's movie and " the seventh victim " deal with everyday life terror , there's apparently nothing supernatural , it is a normal world where unusual details occasionally surface . Most amazing thing , all the characters are interesting , not at all the cardboard ones you can meet in 95 % of today's fantasy and horror flicks . A poet , an one-armed woman who plays the piano , a circle of respectable devil worshipers , a woman who seems to have gone nuts , because of them , or because she already had this great fascination for death ( this scene when Hunter opens her sister's bedroom door and sees the noose above a chair gives the jitters . ) I cannot find a single weak sequence in this movie . It may last only seventy minutes , its density is extraordinary : the detective's death and the unusually inventive use of the subway ; the sister's reappearance , almost zombie-like ; the shower ; the worshipers , trying to make their victim commit suicide ; the two men setting their faith in Christ and his commandments against the " what is good ? what is evil ? " of the disciples of Satan . But the last sequence is unique : having met a suicidal woman in the stairs , the sister comes into her room , we catch a glimpse of the sinister scaffold ; as the other woman is leaving for the city , she can hear a sound ( a chair ? ) , but she hardly notices it and she comes down the stairs quickly . .
583926	1219578	66207	10.0	French beauty at its best	Jacques Demy is a French maker who is famous for his musicals such as " les parapluies de Cherbourg " or " les demoiselles de Rochefort " . For this movie , he chose to adapt a fairy tale written by Charles Perrault during the seventeenth century and he wisely chose . This movie is a real treat , an absolute enchantment and rare are the movies that succeed in recreating the wonderful atmosphere of fairy tales . Everything , here , reaches a level of perfection rarely reached : sceneries and costumes are marvellous , especially the rooms of the first castle that you see at the beginning of the movie . Moreover , a part of it was made at Chambord . Then , the music is really gorgeous and the songs ravishing . I also noticed that Demy introduced a contemporary humor which contains numerous anachronisms . For example , near the end of the film , Jean Marais appears in a helicopter ! However , the story takes place in the seventeenth century . How strange it is . . . Don't forget , a performance of quality . Catherine Deneuve is an ideal and delicate princess but Jean Marais is probably the best actor in the movie . He's very convincing in his role of tormented and jaded king . Besides , it was his last role for the cinema . After that , he's given over to painting and sculpture . Even if certain special effects are a little kitsch , the movie is impregnated with a lot of poetry . So , at the end , a movie that seduces the eyesight and the hearing and this is one of Demy's masterpieces .
584123	1219578	66249	10.0	Ballerinas , Victoria , and the Loch Ness monster .	They are all here in Wilder's most underrated movie . On the site , people complain about the editing , but you cannot put the blame on the director : his three-hour work was boiled down to a two-hour digest . What remains is splendid indeed : magnificence of the film sets - Trauner's work , he who elaborated those of Carné's " les enfants du paradis " ( children of paradise ) - , intelligence of the screenplay ( not adapted from Conan Doyle , achieving the feat of paying a tribute to the great writer while kindly laughing at his hero : Sherlock is manipulated , cheated , sometimes it seems that he's no more in control of what's happening . His deductions are elephantine : at the opera , they use paper swans , therefore ( sic ) the lake monster is a fake . It could be a fake lake too , mind you . Genevieve Page provides the love interest and her sunshade is a good stroke of inspiration . Sherlock certainly did love her , because , when he reads about her tragic demise , he solaces himself with music and fairly disreputable methods . Let's hope , that some day , we will be allowed to see the whole movie as Wilder had originally conceived it : a great director like him more than deserves it !
585230	1219578	24115	10.0	He gave everything . . . .	. . . and took nothing for himself . . . . This Aline McMahon's last line will haunt you long after watching this extremely moving work by William Wellman who was , along Frank Borzage , America's finest director of the early talkies . Both were fighting for the dignity of men , both made movies which - it's all over nowadays , with the possible exception of perhaps Clint Eastwood's work - can help us become better men and women . THere are similarities between " Heroes for sale " and " I'm a fugitive from a chain gang " . In the latter , Paul Muni tries to sell his medals but in the shop , they already got too many of them , so he ' s got to steal . In " heroes for sale " , Tom , who lost all the honors to a coward who shamelessly walked away with the glory , has to cope with everyday's life in the years of depression . Wellman , although his films were heartfelt pleas for the human being , was not optimistic . Happy ends were not for him : Tom ( Heroes ) , Gilda ( " Safe in hell " ) and Lilly Turner in the eponymous film are victims of the war , of fate or of men . They want to keep their promise ( it's obvious in Gilda's and Tom's case ) , even if it costs them their life or their happiness . And let's not forget " the oxbow incident " , the saddest of all westerns , a scene of which shows Dana Andrews writing a letter to his wife he knew he was not to see again . When I watch these Wellman oldies , I'm amazed by this : the really happy moments are so few and far between I wonder how a man or a woman at the end of a hard earned day find some reason to believe . But they are here : the restaurant where Aline McMahon takes in the last lonely and wretched and gives to the poor for free ; Loretta Young's smile which lightens up the seediest of the rooms ; the boy saying : " when I grow up , I want to be like him " . A masterpiece that should not missed .
582719	1219578	60538	10.0	Harrowing , extremely beautiful .	Childhood is in the center of Comencini's work . " Incompreso " sees him going at a peak of true emotion and aesthetic refinement . Comencini is one of the greatest directors Italy has ever known even if he remains in the shadow for so many cine buffs . If you have the chance to see " incompreso " do not miss his other works " lo scopone scientifico " " Pinocchio " , the best version of the Collodi classic and his mammoth series " Cuore " , these two works dealing with childhood too , not to mention such achievements as " Casanova veneziano " ( which beat Fellini at his own game ) and " l'ingorgo " " Incompreso " is one of the saddest movies in the world and however , it's not a melodrama : it's pure emotion , realism , quivering sensitivity . A man's - a consul - wife dies and he ' s left on his own with his two children . He's a good father , but he wants his older son to become adult , to act like a man . Anthony Quayle's portrayal is not that of a tough man ; it's only little by little , in spite of his good will , that he leads his son whom he loves to despair . Some people say that you become a man when you lose one of your parents , after all ! In many a melodrama , we have heard the mother say after the father's death " now you're the man " . Comencini's work is the contrary : for him , even if a child shows more perceptiveness than the grown-ups ( see " lo scopone scientifico " or " cuore " ) , he still remains a child who should be allowed to suffer , to cry and to love . Because the father thinks that a big boy does not need tenderness anymore and he takes only the little brother in his arms . The mother is still here even if the boy does not see her anymore : there's a painting in the house , a tape which the father recorded before her death and mainly a big garden where the two brothers speak of intimate things like death . All the nannies ( are you like Mary Poppins ? asks the younger boy ) in the world that the wealthy dad can pay cannot help : that's why they stay out of the game ( and out of the games ) : never the boys will communicate with them . The first part of the film tends to show that Milo , the little kid , is the frail one ; an admirable sequence , taking place during a storm at night , shows the father taking his little boy to his room . . . but closing his door to the other . SPOILERS : Because his father does not seem to understand him , to love him , to treat him like a . . . child , the only way for him is to go where his mother is . Then begins a harrowing finale , during which the father understands ( but too late ) that his son wanted to die , even if the accident had not happened . The essay which the boy wrote " my best friend , my father " , climaxes the movie . the last picture is an extraordinary fade - in ( the mother's picture ) fade-out ( the dead boy in his bed ) . These final pictures alone would make the movie a masterpiece . Superb cinematography , remarkable cast and credits over paintings of another century , first-class score which enhances the emotions but never drowns them out . Absurd remake by Jerry Schatzberg in 1984 ( " misunderstood " ) with Gene Hackman taking on the part of the father and colossal mistakes ( flashback where the mother appears , hollywoodian happy end ) . These remakes are really a curse .
583199	1219578	39739	10.0	Chabrol's predecessor .	First of all , there is a detective story : " légitime défense " by Belgian Stanislas André Steeman whose " l'assassin habite au 21 " Clouzot had already transferred to the screen in 1942 , with Pierre Fresnay and the same actress Suzy Delair . Steeman complained about Clouzot's adaptation for both movies . The movie from 1942 was excellent , but the " detective story " side had been kept , so why complaining ? As for " Quai des orfèvres " , Clouzot was now in a new phase of his brilliant career . After having directed " le corbeau " and been blacklisted , he had a lot more to say than a simple whodunit . Steeman complained essentially about the poor detective ending , which I will not reveal of course , but Clouzot focused on the social vignettes , on his characters's psychology , and he did not give a damn about the puzzle à la Agatha Christie . By doing so , he becomes the genuine predecessor of CLaude Chabrol who has always been closer to him than to Alfred Hitchcock whom he admires much though . Suzy Delair has great screen presence , and you will love the song she really sings ( she was a singer too ) " avec son tralala " . Bernard Blier gives , as ever , a sparing of gestures and words performance , and he really pulls it off . Two characters are particularly interesting and disturbing : the first one , Dora , the photographer : she takes pictures of female models , and Clouzot , by subtle touches , reveals us she's a lesbian . Of course , the word is never uttered ( How could it be in 1947 ? ) The police chief ( fabulous Louis Jouvet ) tells her : " You and me , WE are not lucky with women . " The portrait of this cop is very detailed : we learn a lot of things about him , not necessary connected with the Delair / Blier plot : he's a widower , with a son he adores and who runs into school difficulties , particularly in geometry . So we get to know all the characters in depth . One of the most important manifesto of post-war French cinema .
584451	1219578	31885	10.0	dancing on a volcano . . .	Jean Renoir is often considered as one of the masters of French cinema of the thirties . He surprised in the diversity of the genres he tackled during that era : literary adaptation ( Madame Bovary , 1933 ) , entertaining comedy ( Boudu Sauvé Des Eaux , 1932 ) or political manifestation ( la Marseillaise , 1937 ) . Perhaps more than " la Grande Illusion " ( 1937 ) , " la Règle Du Jeu " is the magnum opus of that era and perhaps of Renoir's whole career . A movie offering a great variety of tones and a liberty of style which looks like a light comedy but which conceals delicate topics . Given that it was a mirror of French society , it encompassed an unusual construction , a highly worked and unconventional directing , it is easy to understand why the movie was decried by French public in 1939 . Throughout the years , it was butchered , was cut several times before fortunately being restored to favor in 1965 . Renoir had developed in some of his anterior films a scathing critic of French bourgeoisie . Movies like " Nana " ( 1926 ) , " la Chienne " ( 1931 ) or " Boudu Sauvé Des Eaux " ( 1932 ) already embodied a wholesale massacre of the upper-class milieu whom Renoir underscored their hypocritical aspect . " La Règle Du Jeu " is his last attack on this society . The filmmaker understood that it was impossible to change the aristocratic world and its shallow rules . The tail end is here to prove it . Robert De la Chesnaye ( Marcel Dalio ) by qualifying Jurieu's death as a " deplorable accident " whereas it was a premeditated murder saved the appearances . But Renoir also knew that the Second World War was about to break out and was going to put an end to the aristocratic domination . So , he felt that it was his duty to give a true image of French bourgeoisie before the tragedy . Renoir's magnum opus is an innovative film because the director did the opposite of what a majority of French filmmakers did at that time . Many of Renoir's French peers relished on Hollywood conventions to tell and shoot the stories of their films . Here , the movie isn't built from one character's standpoint but from a group of characters belonging to different social classes , a scheme which was unusual in the thirties . Renoir used this device for a better observation of French society in decay and he was audacious enough to break the rules of narrative continuity and to use a complex directing . For example , he had tapped the depth of field in his wondrous " Partie De Campagne " ( 1936 ) , here , he used it again with startling results to create memorable images , notably during the party sequence . Renoir knew very well the aristocratic world he described in his film because he used to belong to it . He was the son of the famous French impressionist painter , Auguste Renoir . An important part of the film takes place in " la Colinière " , a mansion which seems to be virtually cut off from the world , it's the sole world which exists . " La Règle Du Jeu " represents a world with a constricting etiquette , immutable values . Two camps : the smug , posh bourgeoisie and the servants . Its members are walled up in their respective social background and the two most important criteria of distinction are money and property . Apart this hard-hitting assessment , Renoir's genius shines when it comes to underline their mediocrity and lack of education . Jackie tells Mrs La Bruyère that she studies Pre-Colombian art and the latter assimilates it to Buffalo Bill . Moreover , the " rule " in question is based on lie , hypocrisy and injustice . La Chesnaye has an affair with his mistress Geneviève and his wife Christine ignores this . But the sight at the shooting party is a symbolic object because she makes Christine's eyes open about this illicit love affair . But perhaps the most powerful symbol of this society is the automatons . They are clockwork toys just like the rules , the manners which govern an ossified world . Then if Jurieu died at the end of the film , it's because he remained honest in a world of corruption . Although there are no direct references to war , there are veiled hints at it throughout Renoir's work . Of course , the famous hunting sequence was often interpreted as warning signs to the tragedy , but also during the party with the " danse macabre " , the way the audience reacts : a mirror of French society about the impending tragedy which weighs like a Sword of Damoclès and the military capacities of French army . But there another allusions to war elsewhere in Renoir's work : the tolling of the bells when the guests arrive to la Colinière , the gun shots La Chesnaye can hear when he walks in his domain , his gamekeeper Schmacher's persona . . . Moreover , there are clear signs that this society is in poor running , notably during the party sequence . The frontier between masters and servants is abolished . An impression of disorder is enhanced by an astute use of the depth of field and long takes during which several actions take place in the same time . Then , Christine who will think of fleeing from this rotten microcosm . But , in the end , La Chesnaye will have saved the appearances . But for how long ? Every sequence , every character of " la Règle Du Jeu " should be studied in detail . It's an unqualified must for any cine buff . The technical innovations will have an influence on future directors like François Truffaut while the bourgeois satire will be later resumed by Henri-Georges Clouzot and Claude Chabrol .
583595	1219578	69235	10.0	A modern fable .	The cast for this fable is fabulous : two great American actors , Joseph Cotten and Bette Davis , two great Italian ones : Alberto Sordi and Silvana Mangano . Pepino and Antonia , two Italian proles are waiting , every summer , for " the old lady " , a wealthy and disabled American in order to fleece her . How ? By playing cards with her in a game called " lo scopino scientifico = the scientific broom sweep " We ' ll never know the name of " the old lady " . They always refer to her like that . In fact , she epitomizes capitalism . Bette Davis is wonderful and sadistically smiling all the way . Always with him , an old beau ( her former lover ? ) whom she enjoys humiliating ( brilliant Cotten ) . Against the Money Goddess , two miserable wops , ( pitiful Sordi and authoritarian Mangano ) always short of the readies , to whom the old one is always compelled to lend some dough to begin a game . And a game that will be the funniest ever filmed : the Italians begin to win , they win more , more and more and they want to call it a day ? But the old woman is not prepared to accept it . She wants to play more , even after a heart attack ! There's the rub : the money game is allowed to these who can go on and on indefinitely . That's Pepino and Antonia's downfall . They lose everything . As always in Luigi Comencini's movies , children are wiser than their parents . Cleopatra , Pépino's elder daughter realizes that it's a foolish game , what can do two proles against the most powerful bank ? You've got to refuse such a game and start a realist fight . As far the Old Lady is concerned , Cleopatra will opt for the final solution , and , maybe , her parents will come back to solidarity with their fellows . This is a must-see . This is a comedy of the first order , sometimes verging on tragedy , Luigi Comencini equals Billy Wilder here , that means a lot !
583236	1219578	53318	10.0	Don't look back .	Tennessee Williams is perhaps America's finest playwright of the last ( ! ) century . He used to say he did not like Mankiewicz's treatment of his work . But in my humble opinion , it ranks along with kazan's " streetcar named desire " and Brooks ' " cat on a hot tin roof " as the peak of M . Lanier's adaptations . First of all , there are the actors : Katherine Hepburn , the grande dame of American cinema . Her rendition of Mrs Venable is stunning . When she delivers the lines of her famous " Encatadas " monologue ( " and the sand all alive , all alive as the hatched sea-turtles made their dash for the sea . . " ) , she's so convincing that we do see the whole scene ! There are skeletons in her closet , so she does not want to look back , and does not want her niece Catherine to remember . Traps are everywhere : the carnivorous plants in her garden have an equivalent in the old doctor's study : mundane flypaper ! Elizabeth Taylor ( Catherine ) , who has perhaps never been better , epitomizes scorned innocence : this character is very important for Williams because it echoes his sister's lobotomy . Fortunately , after a real catharsis , one of the Mankiewicz's peaks ( Catherine's memories come back , and they finally use the full screen as she screams " nobody , nobody on earth could possibly believe it ! ) " And however , we do ! Because of the masterful actor direction , we are forced to believe the unbelievable . The shrink , Monty Clift , who was to feature in John Huston's " Freud " ( sic ) a couple of years later , succeeds in bringing Catherine back to life , although his face looks tormented . ( He was disfigured in an accident ) Mercedes MacCambridge provides good support in a thankless part . " Suddenly last summer " , in a nutshell : Freud meets Gothic drama meets Greek myths . Don't miss it !
584927	1219578	20814	10.0	A genesis	With " David Golder " , Duvivier the great director , the master of the darker side of the human soul was born . It contained the seeds of all that would be developed afterward . Harry-Baur gives a powerful performance of a wealthy Jewish businessman ; he is so good that the actresses seem mediocre by comparison . David Golder thinks that money can buy everything ; he does not want to help his associate who takes his own life ( " I do not care " ° ; his wife and his daughter live in luxury and would not imagine it any other way : see the daughter stroke the banknotes which her dad won for her . She displays no love , no tenderness , no human emotion at all . Later when she comes back to her desperate father , she will have the same behavior . And then David has a heart attack ! The missus is not prepared to accept poverty . While the man is lying on his bed she begins to tell him he may die soon and she has not a Franc to her name . A masterful scene where David grabs her by the throat and almost strangles her with her valuable necklace : " What about that ? " he thunders . There's a similar scene in " Chair de Poule " ( 1963 ) when Catherine Rouvel tries to worm information from a wounded bedridden Robert Hossein ; and Golder's shrew is not unlike Danielle Delorme's abominable mother in " Voici le temps des assassins " ( 1956 ) Like many Duvivier heroes , Golder , although a ruthless financier , is still a human being . When he loses the power that gives money , he thinks that his daughter's love will make up for it . Unfortunately there's no place for love in a world where rapaciousness and greed run rampant . Duvivier's blackness is absolute disembodied blackness . David will go to his grave a broken man . on his death bed , his sufferings are so intense we feel them within our body and our soul . Why such a poor rating ? Do people think that there's anti-Semitism in the film ( and in the novel ) ? There isn't : Harry Baur's wife was a Jew . Based on Irene Nemirovsky's novel ; a writer who sadly was to die in the concentration camps .
