584124	1219578	213807	1.0	dated , dated as hell .	This is not a great French masterpiece . It's full of clichés . Most of the characters are unpleasant or ludicrous . The events of May 1968 are a vague background , with trendy words galore : revolution , nudity , freedom ( check the title ) . The hero is a sort of young bourgeois , wishing to avoid an " imitation of life " but not averse to the occasional little financial paternal help . Actually , how could he afford his own flat without it ? The longing for independence ( trying to work for the fruit crop ) is short-lived . The only reason to see the movie is the beautiful and unfortunate actress Juliette Villard who passed away a few months after the movie was released . Too bad she did not live long enough to play in a good movie . French movies buffs , avoid this piece of garbage and check out Claude Chabrol's contemporary works like " le boucher " or " la rupture " instead : you will be highly rewarded .
583815	1219578	120591	1.0	so as Def Leppard said " armageddon it ! " ( the movie )	Two movies : " the fifth element " , " armageddon " . The same subject : to save the world . The same main actor : Bruce Willis . One difference : " Armageddon " is very inferior to Luc Besson's film . Some spectacular special effects don't succeed in hiding a labored and globally conventional screenplay . Several parts of the movie are showing it . I think about the president's speech and especially Willis ' relationship with his daughter , " Grace " . At the beginning of the movie , he tends to neglect and overprotect her and this makes her weary . Then , at the end of the movie , it's true love and understanding that shine in him . On another hand , the movie falls in the following trap : Michael Bay takes his subject too seriously . Of course , the movie tries to be funny but the result doesn't work as the humor introduced in the movie is often crude and pretty low-level whereas in the " fifth element " , the humor was zany , involuntary and enabled to overlook the serious side of the action . The movie suffers from two other handicaps : it often falls into the ridiculous ( the Russian astronaut ) and almost all the actors are bad used . Bruce Willis is all the contrary of his " fifth element " ' s character . He plays the he-man , he hams it up and sometimes , he's unbearable . The other actors are barely credible in their own roles , particularly , Willis ' sinking crew . It seems that this crew is here just for having fun . One of them is taken for being very qualified but he looks like a fool . And poor Liv Tyler ! She's at the NASA just to be decorative . When the movie was released in France in August 1998 , Bruce Willis expressed is weariness of saving the world . His weariness was probably justified by this spectacular but poor movie .
585417	1219578	119972	1.0	a movie full of mediocrity	Just a short and basic review about this turkey and a positive one ! But fortunately three unfavorable votes . The person who wrote it must have few demanding tastes as regards cinema . Let's take the year 1997 . If I had to retain the most outstanding young people movie of the year in the positive sense of the word , I would choose the hypnotic and piercing " Life of Jesus " by Bruno Dumont , a ruthless chronicle about young people trapped in their small city of Bailleul , without future . It's a work with an undeniable artistic weight . What about the worst young people movie of the year ? Well it's this dud : " four boys full of future " ! It occupies a first-choice place in which the young people movie ( even French comedy ) can offer worst and I think that the current mark ( 6 . ) is too much high for such a piece of garbage which flounders between vulgarity and flabbiness , drivel and commonplaces . The title itself of the movie is quite meaningless . There are indeed four boys who are the main protagonists of the film but what is their future made of ? At a pinch , it could be attributed in an ironical way to Arnaud . There's a blatant absence of directing and the director Jean Paul Lillienfield contents himself to record execrable dialogs . Three scriptwriters including the director gathered to produce a two-bit and skimpy story with a more than meager potential . It gives the impression of having been written in a slapdash manner without the single hint of rigor . It never takes off , includes what seem to be parodical components of the teenage movie , elements which have nothing to do here . There are also snatches of " les Sous Doués " ( 1980 ) by Claude Zidi . It wasn't a masterwork but at least Zidi's flick made us sometimes smile . To come back to the story , when it seems to take a direction ( Arnaud's mates who decide to help him ) , it is drowned in a spate of implausibilities and of course , the happy end is " de rigor " . It's not an unfathomable cast which will make up for the extreme paucity of the script . The young comedians ' intolerable antics undermine the movie and some actors are used in an unexpected and absurd way . Why Thierry Lhermitte ( also producer ! ) in the role of a cop ? Without mentioning an atrocious Patrick Sébastien who reveals here , in all its splendor his more than restrained gifts as an actor . A superb hash of money for this incredible drivel which makes me sick . Yuk ! You understood it : it's the kind of movie to skip at all costs . If you're looking for a valuable entertaining movie , please pass by and if you can , try to watch the movie I mentioned in the beginning of my review : " the Life of Jesus " .

And what he gets . . . is not far from what the " scriptwriters " produced here .

583591	1219578	53198	1.0	Living a wild life	This film aka " the four hundred blows " is a mistranslation . Faire les 400 coups " means " to live a wild life . As a French , I'm stunned when I see the popularity of this good , but by no means outstanding film . 1 . It's not the first film of the " nouvelle vague " move ; check Agnes Varda's " la pointe courte " , ( 1956 ) Alain Resnais's " Hiroshima mon amour " ( 1958 ) , Claude Chabrol's " le beau serge " ( 1958 ) are anterior . Historically , " les 400 coups " comes after . 2 . The " nouvelle vague " was sometimes ponderous and hard on their predecessors : Overnight , Julien Duvivier , Henri-George Clouzot , Claude Autant-Lara , Yves allégret and a lot of others were doomed to oblivion . THis selfishness and this contempt is typically " nouvelle vague " . You ' ve never heard ( or read ) the great generation of the thirties ( Renoir , Carné , Grémillon , Duvivier already , Feyder ) laugh at , say , Maurice Tourneur or Max Linder . So , thanks to Truffaut and co , some people will never discover some gems of the French fifties or forties ( Duvuvier's " sous le ciel de Paris " , Autant-Lara's " douce " , Yves Allégret's " une si jolie petite plage " and " manèges " ) . THe novelle vague clique went as far as saying that William Wyler , Georges Stevens and Fred Zinemann were worthless ! 3 . " Les 400 coups " is technically rather disappointing : it's very academic , the story is as linear as it can be , the teachers are caricatures , and the mother Claire Maurier delivers such memorable lines as ( you've got to be a French circa 1960 to understand how ridiculous it is ) : Well , your father ' s got only his brevet ( junior school diploma ) and , as for me , I've got only my high school diploma ! You've got to know , that circa 1960 , hardly 10 % of the pupils had the HSD in France ! Antoine Doinel should have been proud of his mother after all ! She wants him to have diplomas , who can blame her ? 4 . Compared to the innovations of " Hiroshima mon amour " , which features a brand new form , and a new " fragmented " content , " les 400 coups " pales into significance . Truffaut will master a new form only with the highly superior " Jules and Jim " , helped by the incomparable Jeanne Moreau . 5 . The interpretation is rather stiff ; Jean-Pierre Léaud , arguably listenable when dubbed in English , is still decent , but he will soon degenerate into the most affected of his generation . 6 . The topic = stolen childhood had better days , before ( Julien Duvivier's " Poil de carotte " , Luis Bunuel's " los olvidados " ) and will have after ( Maurice Pialat's " l'enfance nue " , Kenneth Loach's " Kes " ) I do not want to demean Truffaut , his movie is not bad , but , frankly , French movie buffs , prefer " Jules and Jim " " l'enfant sauvage " ( a film honest , true and commercially uncompromizing to a fault ) " l'argent de poche " ( as academic as " 400 coups " but much more funny ) or his nice Hitchcock pastiche " vivement dimanche " .
582330	1219578	60561	1.0	Abysmal	" Joe Caligula " was reportedly forbidden by the censorship at the same time as Jacques Rivette's " la religieuse ' , but not for the same reasons . " Joe Caligula " anticipated Quarantino's extreme violence by more than thirty years . That does not make it a good movie for all that , by a long shot . It is actually one of the worst French duds I have ever seen . The credits go as far as claiming this : If John Ford is Homer ( why not after all ? the great director compares favorably with the Greek poet ) , then José Bénazéraf is . . . . . ( you'll never guess it ) Marcel Proust . Well , if it is so , then Ed Wood is Shakespeare . Bénazéraf is known ( but only by people who like that kind of stuff ) for his porno movies which were to follow in the wake of " Joe " : many scenes of this movie verge on porno anyway : strip tease , nude women in bed . . . Well if Howard Hawks depicted Scarface as some kind of Borgia , why not Caligula for a young crook ? The problem lies in the fact that Joe has absolutely nothing to do with the Roman emperor . Played by the late Gérard Blain , who was a commendable actor when there was a Duvivier , a Chabrol or a Wenders to direct him , but here sank without a trace . Ditto for Ginette Leclerc , who was formerly directed by Pagnol , Clouzot and Duvivier ! The rest of the cast is zombie-like , particularly the female lead Jeanne Valérie . The script is so dismal that the actors often repeat their lines twice , five times and even more ! When the starlet in tears tells the story of her lover ( or husband who cares ) who was burnt alive ( and is still burning , she points out ) , it is unintentionally highly comic . The story ? well I shall now come to the question : Bénazéraf pits Joe and his young pack against a bunch of " old " gangsters and their molls . There's no more to say . That such a turkey can be mentioned in " Guide des Films " , the Bible of the French cine buff ( and granted one star at that ! ) is beyond me .
584798	1219578	73155	1.0	The most overrated French movie of all time ?	This one is a strong contender ! Romy Schneider was highly praised ( and granted a Cesar ) for her " harrowing " part but Zulawski is definitely a deeply boring terribly pretentious director . Outside Schneider , the casts includes zombie Dutronc who portrays a totally unconvincing character with suicidal tendencies and Fabio Testi , one of the worst Italian actors . The plot is very trite but it is given a " meaningful " " intellectual " treatment whose purpose is to make the audience feel they have watched an " important " work . Nadine Chevalier was Schneider's answer to those who thought she was still their Sissi . I'm not an intellectual : I like Sissi best .
585350	1219578	120337	3.0	pseudo suspense	Bernard Rapp's premier film is firmly anchored in the world of books and publishing . It's a domain the former French journalist knows like the back of his hand for he composed many books as well as he produced and host some television programs about writers . Sadly , his wide knowledge as regards the publishing world is harmed by a total absent command of the detective genre and its main motor : suspense . From the moment onwards when Edward Lamb ( Terence Stamp ) looks at the telegram informing him about the death of his erstwhile lover and goes to Tunisia to find out the truth about her death , it's downhill because one can easily guess who the culprit is and the conspiracy Edwards will elaborate to avenge himself from his gifts as a forger . Real suspense isn't on appointment and the writing is on the wall for both Nicolas Fabry ( Daniel Mesguich ) and the film itself . " Tiré à Part " is also sadly marred by a caricatured depiction of the characters . It was ill-advised from Rapp to have chosen Daniel Mesguich as the quarry of Lamb's manipulation . His character of unscrupulous , brash writer and his rather repulsive physic make him detestable straight away . It's also hardly palatable that he didn't feel any remorse after his murder . If it had been the case , he would have been a more ambiguous character and the film would have taken another better direction . As for Terence Stamp , he deserves better than his role . Ditto for Jean-Claude Dreyfuss who seems to be bored here . Rapp who had English ancestors was fond of English culture but it's superfluous from him to have chosen Great-Britain than France for the backdrop of his ramshackle thriller for it doesn't bring anything useful to the fragile story . It's a shame for Rapp : had he penned a more solid story , he would have better served his topic of manipulation . A theme which will be at the core of his next effort : " une Affaire De Goût " ( 2000 ) .
584294	1219578	87712	3.0	Wanted	Based on the true story of a French gangster who was widely talked about in the late seventies . Made by Claude Chabrol's producer Paul Genovès . And played by Nicolas Silberg - who is best known for his Bussy character in the excellent " Dame de Montsoreau " miniseries circa 1975 - , de la Comédie Française , thus the only real convincing actor of the whole movie , sadly unsupported by the rest of the cast and Genovès's poor directing . It's difficult to have interest in such a character . There are subjects which are not really appealing . Okay Mesrine thought , and for a good reason , for he spent twenty years of his life in jail , in top security wing , that prison was inhuman and destroyed the human being ; thus his plan of a great escape where he would free all the prisoners of La Santé , a penitentiary where he was the first and only to escape from to this day . It does not justify all those crimes : 39 in all .
584143	1219578	67805	3.0	Sunday boring Sunday .	This is exactly the kind of movie that passes for " intellectual " " must-see " for snobs . Actually it is one of the biggest chores the British cinema has produced . This movie came at least ten years TOO LATE : Antonioni cum Tennessee Williams was over the hill at the time . Intended as some kind of " bourgeois " ordinary life - as Ken Loach does for the proles , but with much more talent - , with a " scandalous " touch thrown in for good measure . Murray Head , the " star " ( of Judas " Jesus Christ Superstar fame ! ) is supposed to be a painter , he's actually a gigolo for both Glenda Jackson and Peter Finch ( two wasted actors ) , since we never see him work . There's the rub : in this bourgeois world , everything is allowed . Had Schlesinger situated his story in middle - class , he would have taken more risks . But look at all these posh people at the Jew celebration ; and look how ridiculous Finch is : he looks almost as old as his parents and his aunt . This may be psychological drama , but it's an overcautious approach , very politically correct . Just compare to James Ivory's courageous " Maurice " , as far homosexuality is concerned . A far cry from his " midnight cowboy " ( 1969 )
584156	1219578	289765	3.0	I can't understand the high popularity rating for " Red Dragon "	The title of my review says it all : I can't understand the high popularity rating for " Red Dragon " . When the movie was broadcast on French TV , I went on IMDb to check the mark : 7 , 4 out 10 ! This made me want to watch this film and the story reminded me of " the silence of the lambs " ' . At first sight , " Red Dragon " seems to be a promising movie : 1 mysterious serial killer nicknamed " the tooth fairy " ( Ralph Fiennes ) slaughters families every full moon . As a consequence , a FBI agent ( Edward Norton ) is required to track him down . Only one man can help him in his investigation : the doctor Hannibal Lecter ( Anthony Hopkins ) . A difficult task for Norton in the way he arrested this doctor a long time ago because he found out his terrible secret : Lecter is very fond of human flesh . . . From there , " Red Dragon " has all the elements to become a first class thriller in the tradition of " Silence of the lambs " . But here , nothing arouses the interest . Where does the disappointment comes from ? From several embarrassing points that handicap the film . First , Edward Norton who can't make forget Jodie Foster as an ambitious cop and his performance has got nothing stunning . Then , unlike Brett Ratner unlike Jonathan Demme is unable to create a constant climate of tension . As a result , you progressively lose interest in the plot . Given that the shortcomings override the assets , there's nothing left but one hope to save this thriller : Anthony Hopkins . Alas ! Dashed hope once again . If his threatening and penetrating countenance contributed to the success of " Silence Of The Lambs " , here in " Red Dragon " his firm and somewhat mocking face doesn't impress the audience . This last handicap finishes tarnishing the movie that you can consider as a pale copy of Demme's movie . A lifeless and tedious thriller . If " Silence of the Lambs keeps on haunting me a long time after I watched it , I have very little memories from " Red Dragon " . If you haven't watched it , you don't miss anything , really .
584664	1219578	219699	4.0	the crew that made this supposedly fantastic thriller wasn't gifted at all !	Possible spoilers . . . Nowadays , psychological fantastic is a cinematographic genre that is so much successful that several film-makers ( who aren't however specialized in this domain ) tried their hand at it . Some of them perfectly succeeded their conversion like Adrian Lyne with " Jacob's Ladder " ( 1990 ) while others failed : " What Lies Beneath " was a disappointment in Robert Zemeckis ' work . Sadly , with " the Gift " ( 2000 ) , Sam Raimi definitely belongs to the second category . Before watching the movie I didn't expect much of it because I had already quite bad reviews about it . I was right and it isn't difficult to define the reasons why this film badly works . First , " the Gift " suffers from a patchy cast . If I am touched by Cate Blanchett and Hilary Swank's sensitive performances , on another hand , Sam Raimi made a mistake by hiring Keanu Reeves . He acts a violent and racist character which makes him disagreeable right away . His pitiful performance spoils the movie and you can really regret his role as Neo in " the Matrix " ( 1999 ) . The failure of " the Gift " also comes from the screenplay . It was partly written by Billy Bob Thornton and it doesn't carry much weight . It consists of a thin plot that has nothing special . Sorry Mr Thornton but we have already seen the trick of the wrong culprit many times before . Furthermore , it isn't really a suspense story that Thornton designed . We can quite easily guess the person who is responsible for the murder of Jessica King from the beginning of the movie . Indeed , at this moment , Katie Holmes asks Cate Blanchett if she and her husband will have a bright future . I can't remember very well what she can see but I know it wasn't hopeful visions . Then , the same Katie Homes dates with quite numerous men in the small town . It is enough to make her husband angry . Due to this , it is very tempting to think that an important part of the film is nearly padding . It seems that Thornton did everything to leave the story a little low-key so as to leave the best in the last sequences of the film . But given that you guessed the real culprit , they fall flat . Besides , the end of the film is no good because the scriptwriters have succumbed to a fashion : to amaze the spectator by inserting a " coup de théâtre " . But it is so hokey that it doesn't make the end of the film convincing . If he perfectly succeeds in recreating a Southern atmosphere thanks to the scenery , the landscapes , the mentality of the inhabitants and even the music , Sam Raimi fails to impose a disturbing climate . It is embarrassing for a supposedly fantastic movie . All right , there are a few frightening moments , but unfortunately too rare , they don't enable the movie to take off . Then , a quality that you could attribute to Sam Raimi is that through the years , he had found his own style without the help from Hollywood which had made him a recognizable director as the cult horror movie " Evil Dead " ( 1981 ) and the excellent detective movie " A Simple Plan " ( 1998 ) testify . Here , he gives the impression of having shooting " the Gift " with Hollywood presence on his back . Several passages in the film clearly show it and I will retain this one : the inevitable trial sequence . " Ultimately , " the Gift " is a very impersonal and disappointing movie where Raimi , once an iconoclastic film-maker lost his credibility in Hollywood mainstream . One last thing , the meeting Raimi-Thornton-Blanchett doesn't necessarily shine .
585414	1219578	415932	4.0	The onset of " Lemming " is catchy but then it gets bogged down in oil slick	In 2000 , Dominik Moll had introduced us Harry in " With a Friend Like Harry " ( 2000 ) , a charismatic and mysterious character admirably acted by Sergi Lopez who by wishing Michel's well had managed to break his peaceful household although it was a bit on the edge on a knife . Five years later , he returned to the attack with the long-anticipated " Lemming " starring once again Laurent Lucas . This time it's not one person who is nasty to him but two offbeat people : André Dussollier and Charlotte Rampling . There's a major difference with Moll's previous opus : " Lemming " doesn't match " With a Friend Like Harry " ' s brilliance at all because it's too woolly , incoherent to hold water whereas the former work was absolutely clear in its script and didn't present the single mistake in its logical way of thinking . The movie promises great things but loses steam halfway through . It gets off to a good start with a Chabrolian aura to let the vices of a seemingly well-behaved and respectable upper-class couple show through . Even better , Moll has the capacity to create from a trite situation an ominous atmosphere which makes the viewer feel uncomfortable . Is there anything more trite than a dinner with one's boss ? But when Rampling asks Dussollier the following question : " Was it one of your b ? " , a feeling of unpleasantness invades the viewer and stays inside him or her until the middle of the film . And an eerie Charlotte Rampling excels in a part which requires ambiguity , mystery . Her motivations towards Lucas and her frail spouse Charlotte Gainsbourg remain undetermined : does she try to put an end to their love life or isn't she prey to madness ? And one could also specify that her husband as weird as her tries to make life impossible to Lucas . Perhaps , he try to split them too . Be that as it may , after this memorable evening , the movie takes the way of the fantastic and one figures that we have a first-class movie between one's hands . The making evolutes on the razor's edge , the unusual nature of the movie is slowly and softly hatched , the relationships between the characters become blurred , the strangeness of the situations alarm . . . Alas , in the middle of the course , it's downhill and the attention ends up diluting itself in the ins and outs of a convoluted and tortuous story à la David Lynch and the protagonists ' psychological drifts remove the flick all charm and all cohesion . Because it wants too much , " Lemming " loses its efficiency and the whole crew loses the plot . Moll's work is also marred by a cosy end which takes the easy way . If " With a Friend Like Harry " occupies a prominent place in my favorite movies made in 2000 , " Lemming " has a prime place in the category of the dashed hopes of 2005 . If you are a David Lynch buff , this one has your name on it and for the others : caution !
583793	1219578	39234	4.0	The supervisor does not work wonders , neither does the film .	This movie features a bunch of children locked up in a reform school under a nasty headmaster's thumb ; then comes a very nice human supervisor played by Noël-Noël . And presto , the naughty brats become angels with golden voices who set up a choir , and the distinguished old ladies who visit the school are on cloud nine , well , you get the picture . First thing to bear in mind is that these children were professional singers : all of them were part of " les petits chanteurs à la croix de bois " ( the little singers with the wooden cross ) , so do not be fooled , the supervisor is not in any way responsible for their prowesses . Well the plot is not unlike " going my way " , except that the main actor is not a singer like Bing Crosby . This mushy weepie , which seems sometimes unbearable - but not more than , say , " dead poets society " - , is typical Occupation cinema , the likes of " le voile bleu " . It's a return to good old morality : individuality is condemned , everyone must be part of the group , the choir becoming a transparent metaphor . The ending in the church is almost sirkesque . Remade ( or almost ) as " les choristes "

Another movie about the white slave trade , a subject the French cinema was fond of : in the thirties Robert Siodmak made " Le Chemin De Rio " aka " Cargaison Blanche " . The working title of " Les Impures " was " Des Femmes Disparaissent " ( Women vanish ) and this title would be used for another movie about the same subject by Edouard Molinaro starring Robert Hossein in 1959 . That said , it's not good news : two excellent leads , Raymond Pellegrin and Micheline Presles are lost in a story unworthy of their talent . There are enormous gaffes : how can Michèle , who works in a nightclub as a chanteuse / Cancan dancer , be so naive ? How can she believe that her love " undergoes a period of training " ? . It depends on what kind of training it is , mind you . Many of the scenes are good for a laugh . Barely .
582385	1219578	67710	4.0	Violent and absurd thriller .	Yves Boisset has always been a director with a political obsession . IN the seventies , he hit his stride with such work as " RAS " , " Dupont-Lajoie - ( which will probably remains his best work - and even " le juge Fayard dit le shériff " . Afterward , his filmography became more disparate , but his ambitions surfaced again in " allons enfants " ( 1981 ) and in his excellent made-for-TV " le pantalon " ( 1997 ) . " Le saut de l'ange " , on the other hand , has almost nothing to recommend it ; for the time is was an extremely violent movie , which actually recalls more Boisset's first effort , " Coplan sauve sa peau " ( 1967 ) than his " serious " political films . A far-fetched script , which includes a lot of sadism ( a man with his two legs broken given over to a cobra , ouch ! ) , and all kinds of crimes and brutality under a caricature of a police ' s faraway eye . No need to say that the political background is quickly forgotten , as the audience follows Yanne's ruthless revenge . The cast is absurd : the late Yanne , a decorative Senta Berger , and Sterling Hayden who is completely wasted - he's supposed to be an alcoholic , but we never see him drink anything , not even Perrier - .

584462	1219578	81339	4.0	When the actors overplay	Robert Enrico was at his best during the sixties , " les aventuriers " ( 1966 ) and " tante Zita " ( 1967 ) ; although deemed " commercial " at the time , these two works have something of a dirge . Actress Johanna Shimkus dies in the former - and her funeral under the sea is one of the most extraordinary sequence of the French cinema in the sixties - , and has to cope with her aunt's death in the latter . Both feature François de Roubaix's sublime scores . Afterwards , Enrico ' s career became eclectic and erratic : " ho " ( 1968 ) which featured Jean-Paul Belmondo and Shimkus again was clearly uninspired and " le boulevard du rhum " was not adequate a vehicle for Brigitte Bardot's career then on the wane . He won a cesar for " le vieux fusil " , but if the first third which enhances Romy Schneider's frail beauty is quite moving , what remains , the castle , complete with dungeons , secret passages and two-way mirrors , recalls Louis Feuillade's silent movies circa 1914 . " Pile ou face " recalls the worst Chabrol movies . Two stories intertwines and do not sustain interest : has a man ( Serrault ) killed his wife ? Who pulls the strings in a drug affair among the young men of means ? Robert Enrico , who directed the two great movies I mention at the beginning of my comment with taste and sensitiveness , has called it a day here . His two actors , Serrault and Noiret ( " le vieux fusil " hero ) , hog the stage and drown him out . Generally the French critics were laudatory as for their performances , but I find them boring and irritating : Noiret has never been so vulgar , he who can act with finesse . " Au nom de tous les miens " ( 1983 ) from Martin Gray did something to restore Enrico's reputation , but he never found back his state of grace of the mid-sixties .
585356	1219578	49491	4.0	Damned Dam !	Yves Allégret had already directed Gérard Philipe in " Les Orgueilleux " , one of his best movies . But by the mid-fifties , his inspiration which had produced such classic films noirs such as " Dédée d'Anvers " " Une Si Jolie Petite Plage " , the highly superior " Manèges " and " les Orgueilleux " began to dry up . Gerard Philippe as the star . The first time Allégret had experimented color . And an American firm production . Wide screen . And a dam to build with Philipe as a sick engineer . You might think that with those assets , " La Meilleure Part " ( all the men who work on the building site give the best part of themselves ) is certainly an impressive work ; unfortunately , such is not the case . Allégret substituted production techniques for soul , building a bridge to his audience with his story of immigrated working men , but erecting a dam in front of them with empty words and an awfully desultory script . It is a boring work . One wishes it had not come from Yves Allégret .
585272	1219578	19480	5.0	Too gentle	" Tire - au - flanc " belongs to a genre which is really an acquired taste , the coarse comedy . It reached its peak in the thirties when Raimu and Fernandel starred in " les Gaietés de l'Escadron " or " Ignace " , not those two actors at their best . It's not because a movie was made by Jean Renoir ( or . . . . . fill in the blank ) that it must be looked upon as an immortal masterpiece . Although they did not take place in barracks , " la chienne " and even " on purge bébé " had a stronger anti-militarist feel . Here , when Jean Renoir regains his humor , his wit and his rebellious spirit , it's principally in the subtitles : his lines ( and cartoons ) seem to possess something the pictures sometimes lack . Of course , there are funny scenes : the girl's presence in the barracks is good fun . But the last pictures are finally a capitulation ; after all , - I quote the colonel - the Army succeeds in making men ! Is that really funny to press-gang young men into a relatively comfortable army ? Opinions differ .
582367	1219578	91535	5.0	Cold as a grave .	This movie enjoys a very good reputation in France . This is a bleak depressing dirge-like effort . A cop ( Marielle ) has lost his daughter ( killed by her mother , now in an insane asylum ) and he acts as if she's still alive , telling her about his investigation into a horrible murder . The last lines , when the detective visits the grave are almost unbearable . The two stories do not hang well together . And we cannot help but feel some homophobia and misogyny while we're watching Heynemann's flick . It's an earnest movie , but it's also a bit boring . The long conversations between the cop and his suspect become grating in the long run . The movie is dedicated to Edgar P . Jacobs . The connection between the creator of the adventures of Blake and Mortimer and the film escapes me , I fear . . . The hero's colleague is a true movie buff . And he mentions Frank Borzague's masterpieces such as " mortal storm " and " strange cargo " . Which is very dangerous . Because , personally , it makes me feel like ditching Heynemann and savoring Borzague . Heynemann's best film remains his first " la question " .
585242	1219578	116445	5.0	a disappointment in Patrice Leconte's work	After a series of movies all excellent since " Tandem " ( 1987 ) , " les grands ducs " is the first real disappointment from Patrice Leconte . Critics and public slagged it off when the movie was released in the beginning of 1996 . What to say about this film ? It isn't a really bad movie . What surprises is the rapidity with which Leconte shot his movie . It gives the impression of a quickly made and somewhat botched movie . That's why it appears as disappointing . All right , Patrice Leconte adopted a lively and brisk making , full of liberty and movements and it is obvious that he gave Jean Rochefort , Philippe Noiret and Jean-Pierre Marielle a free hand . These three strapping fellows have a tremendous time in their respective roles and I am obliged to recognize that it is nearly a treat to see them going over the top . Furthermore , the comical situations are well organized even if a little predictable . In short , the mayonnaise isn't thickening because the rhythm of the movie is too fast to be really interested by the story . Leconte should have shown more rigor and too much liberty , too many gestures end up exhausting the attention . " Les grand ducs " remains a bombastic and excessive film which has its funny sequences but it isn't to be ranked among Leconte's major works .
583297	1219578	39179	5.0	As the miller told his tale . . . .	. . . the viewer's face turned a whiter shade of pale ! The first film using the Rouxcolor process ( and also the last ) , the film was made to fight against American color movies which could attract the French audience to the detriment of their local production . Today the film has lost most of its pristine charm : it looks like another color movie , where the colors are not that beautiful , although it's much better than the faded gevacolor of Christian-Jaque's " Barbe - Bleue " ( 1951 ) " La Belle Meunière is an ( imaginary , without a doubt ) moment in the life of Franz Schubert portrayed by singer Tino Rossi . If you do not like this kind of singer , take to your heels : in the first part , he sings every five minutes ; he even sings when the miller and his daughter are talking ! What's bred in the bone comes out in the flesh : although it takes place abroad , the characters and the story look like . . . a Pagnol story . All that the miller needs is a Provençal accent . Although wearing a horrible wig with big braids - to get the Teutonic look - , Pagnol's wife , Jacqueline is another Pagnolesque heroine : the baron in his castle wants her to be his mistress and he paints in glowing colors what she stands to gain from taking this position ! Of course Pagnol ( and Schubert ) does not approve of such a dishonor , but it's nevertheless the only movie by the director where the moral is not intact in the end . Brigitte is another soon-to-be " Angèle " Schubert spends some time in a mill . Just like Alphonse Daudet in Pagnol's swansong " Lettres de Mon Moulin " . As for the music , just compare with Abel Gance's " Un Grand Amour De Beethoven " !
583938	1219578	65462	5.0	What lies beneath	Actually nothing extraordinary . Pierre Boulle's novel and Shaffner's movie had different endings , so you could not ask the French writer for a sequel . This one uses shots from the first one , and allows us to see the fascinating " discovery " scene once more . As for Ted Post's work , it's OK . Nothing extraordinary , but entertaining all along the way . We are far from the heights of the Shaffner's movie though . Zira and Cornelius disappear too soon , and Heston , after a short stint , only comes for the final apocalypse . None of the actors remaining on the " stage " can sustain emotion and tension . THe settings in the subterraneans where the men live are impressive , but why do they worship the bomb ? The most moving part happens when Nova , out of despair , manages to speak ( in Boulle's book , Taylor ( Mérou ) taught her the human language ) . The end of the movie seemed definitive . And yet . .

She plays a young aristocrat whose family is completely broke . Her fiancé , a duke marries her rival , a rich lumpish bourgeois . So she marries in money with a wealthy manufacturer but she refuses to consummate the marriage . She will soon discover that her hubby has got a big heart . Gance might have filmed the short sequences which take place in the factory , with the molten metal , which are more inventive than the rest which is routine melodrama . Best sequences are those when the Bourgeois tries to become a Gentihomme : as Molière proved it in the Seventeenth century , it's " mission : impossible " . He overturns the countess's cup of tea , and , during the posh meal , his crude manners cannot fool his refined son-in-law and the servants . Like this ? Try these . . . .

585259	1219578	146316	5.0	the moral is : rush on the video games , they're much better	To adapt a video game for the screen is like adapting a comic strip to the screen : the result is rarely convincing . " Lara Croft : Tomb Raider " isn't an exception to the rule . When the film was launched in June 2001 , it was announced as one of the biggest commercial successes of the summer in France but it didn't meet the expected success ( hardly 2 million of spectators in the theaters ) . However , the publicity campaign was quite important ( U2's clip " elevation " featuring Lara Croft was released at the same time with the movie . Now concerning the movie , well under its compound subject , the screenplay is a great banality . A sect called " the Illuminati " tries to appropriate a talisman that would enable his members to control the whole world and time . But for this , she needs two pieces of a triangle and Lara's got one of them . A mad chase's starting . . . In short , this is the classical outline specific to adventures movies . Not only was the screenplay inspired by several elements which made the success of this type of movies but it also drew elements from the video game " Tomb Raider " . For example , in the movie we find : magic objects that assure power to the one's got it , mysterious places ( the temple in Cambodia ) , the struggle between good and evil . This is just a lacklustre movie that doesn't innovate anything in the type of the adventures movie . It could have been another Tomb Raider's adventure on a video game . Moreover , the movie irritates a little by its worthy dialogs and its unlikely special effects . As for Angelina Jolie , she's quite convincing , physically and morally in the main role . At the end , " Lara Croft : Tomb Raider " is a film without any great surprises , a bit nonchalant and the fans of the video game will maybe find something in it .
584887	1219578	40284	5.0	Its days are numbered .	One more time , Bulwer-Lytton's book was cheapened in this movie which was to be L'Herbier's next-to-last one . It ' s got a good beginning and a good ending but what remains is a muddled story , not faithful to the original plot , saved by the magnitude of the actors ( Georges Marchal , Micheline Presles and Marcel Herrand ) . The beginning promised great things : it is a flash forward , repeating the final lines of the novel , when the archaeologists discover the places where the - fictional - events took place ; then a court room where a man stands accused which makes most of the film a long flashback . The leads ' names have undergone changes : Glauco / Glaucus becomes Lysia ( s ) and Ione becomes Helene / Elena ; Nydia , the young slave is not blind and she is killed early in the movie which impoverishes the character who was desperately in love with the hero . The poison which makes Lysia lose his mind and his memory is a pure invention from the screenwriters . Of course the Christians are here , but they come at the most awkward moment . The eruption of the volcano is pretty good for the time and the movements in the crowd and the panic are well directed . But if you come to Pompei , the guide will tell you it was impossible to escape by boats and that there were no survivors . Like this ? try these " Gli ultimi giorni di Pompei " ( 1959 ) The Bonnard / Leone Tarzanesque version should be reserved for Steve Reeves ' fans . " Last days of Pompey " was a fine mini-series in the eighties , the best version I know of the celebrated novel . Starring Olivia Hussey , Nicholas Clay and Lynda Pearl .
584274	1219578	109040	6.0	The animal lover	1994 was a beneficial year for Jim Carrey for three movies revealed him to the general public and lined his pockets : " the Mask " , " Dunb and Dumber " and " Ace Ventura " . At the level of quality , " Ace Ventura " finds itself between the two movies . It is better than the " dumb " movie made by the Farrelly brothers although it doesn't match the success of " the Mask " . And precisely , in France , unlike the USA " Ace Ventura " was released after " the Mask " consequently to the commercial triumph of the latter and probably in order to arouse the public's interest for Jim Carrey . Having watched the hare-brained sequel , " Ace Ventura : when nature calls " ( 1995 ) before the present movie , I was able to compare the two movies and it is arguably the first one which is superior . Tom Shadyac isn't a renowned film-maker but in " Ace Ventura " , he shows his ability in bringing a story to a successful conclusion while keeping an eye on his main actor's acting . The main difference with " Ace Ventura : When Nature Calls " lies in the fact that the detective story isn't too spoiled by Carrey's grimaces and his bombastic gestures . In another extent , the humor verges on bad taste , but fortunately , rarely . And there are some good gags without vulgarity which make honestly laugh . " Ace Ventura " is more bearable and slightly higher the average of comedies in which Carrey acted . A last thing : if your favorite pet , one day goes missing , you've got someone to bring it back as fast as possible in your home .
583825	1219578	297284	6.0	And then there were . . . .	In wikipedia , you can read at the end of the long " And then there were none " entry : " although not a direct adaptation , " mindhunters " closely follows the storyline of the book " . It's true that some scenes bear more than a distant resemblance with Christie's classic thriller , but it is not the only one . It's closer , anyway to the play ( like all the versions but the Russian one ) than to the book . . It's mainly glaring in the last scenes where any Christie's reader will compare the three characters'situation to that of Vera , Wargrave and Lombard . That said , " Mindhunters " is not devoid of interest . You can also feel the " Saw " series influence when the " time is running out " . The crimes display some originality and the characters are a bit less cardboard than they usually are in this kind of flick . In the grand tradition of " Psycho " , the most famous actor ( Slater ) is killed in the first third . He should have studied the domino principle in his FBI school .
583060	1219578	309872	6.0	ready for anything to be successful ?	Either it is in France , Great-Britain or in the USA , nearly every big actor felt one day or another to take a turn behind the camera to show their potential as a director . Guillaume Canet , a young charismatic actor added his name to this list which keeps on extending . With " mon idole " ( 2002 ) , his first long feature movie is strongly rooted in the contemporary reality with the following topics : the hypnotic power of television on the public and the relations of manipulation . However , this exercise of style leaves a bitter taste in the mouth after the vision even if the result is far from being uninteresting . Do you remember professor Castro's leitmotiv in Alejandro Amenabar's thriller " Tesis " ( 1996 ) ( We must give the public what he demands . . . ) . The professor thought of the violence . Today , the public wants not only violence but also daring TV shows pushed to the voyeurism . The satire is well here at the beginning of the movie during the TV show . Moreover , later the film contains a significant detail : Jean Louis Broustal breeds vultures . The metaphor is obvious . Nowadays , TV shows , especially TV reality occupy an enormous place in our lives and it can be source of wealth and respectability for the ones who run them . Besides , Canet seizes the opportunity to deride them . The sequence when Broustal , his wife and a friend of them are dancing in the living-room dressed in silly costumes constitutes a good example . It wouldn't be fair to call Broustal's wife a grown-up because she is still a child deep inside her . As for Broustal , all in all he is an eternal pampered child who only thinks of having fun . Now to come back to the starting point , Bastien ( Guillaume Canet is an ambitious young man who would like to climb the ladder in television . He has a project for the telly and he presents it to his manager Jean Louis Broustal ( François Berléand ) . It is useful to add that Bastien is widely impressed by this apparently serious man . Broustal is interested by Bastien's plan and decides to invite him in his country house in the country for the week-end . But Bastien is going to find out that his real motivations are drastically different from Broustal's . It is quite easy to guess Canet's major inspirations . His movie finds itself half-way between " Masques " ( 1987 ) by Claude Chabrol for the setting , the first part of the story , the food and the cinema of the Coen brothers for the caustic tone . There are also strong echoes of " une étrange affaire " ( 1981 ) by Pierre Granier-Deferre . Canet seems to be film-loving to the core . He has also had intuition for the cast . Having hired François Berléand , a largely underrated French actor with a rich filmography was a good idea . Furthermore , him and Canet are well followed by the rest of the cast . The satire is quite fierce , the situations are comical , the actors feel visibly at ease in their respective roles . So , what is wrong with " mon idole " ? Well , first Canet's opus appears a little hesitating because it wavers between comedy , drama and detective movie and as a consequence the young director has difficulty to find a unity and a lasting tone . Actually , the first part of the movie is the most successful . Gradually , we feel the suspense rising and Broustal's real intentions are taking shape . Roughly , we discover that Canet offers us a farce . Problem : it happens in the middle of the film and has strong chances to run out of steam quite quickly . So in order to restart the interest of the spectator , Canet tries his hand at black humor ( the moment when Broustal's wife is involuntarily killing Broustal's friend ) and it is where the movie goes awry . In a way , the young director artificially furnished the second part of the movie and it involves a lack of cohesion to the whole . As a result , Canet wanders from his subject and his movie has difficulty to hold water . What can we say about his making ? It alternates the best and the worst . There's a careful work on light and the scenery but Canet doesn't avoid the flashy effects like to prove his master of making . But if there's a thing in the film that is spoiled , it is the music . About it , " mon idole " has a common feature with Cameron Crowe's movie " Vanilla Sky " ( 2001 ) : both present a badly used and sometimes too intrusive music . Maybe Canet's work is worse because a few songs in it by the feelings they bring out haven't got their place in a story like this one . At the end of the movie we hear " Abraham , Martin and John " ! What did Canet think of when he wrote this sequence ? That's a real disgrace from Canet . Let's also regret a somewhat unsuccessful end because Canet couldn't use a thing that could have kicked the bull's eye : immorality . So , " mon idole " is an interesting but heterogeneous work which could have been much better . It's a shame for Guillaume Canet . But if he wants to shot a second movie maybe will he correct his mistakes .

Now the mistress has a good job and she does not want to renege on love . that said , the story is derivative and it is too bad that the Andrews / daughter relationship should only be skimmed over , and that the part of his wife should be so underwritten . The three leads , Joan Crawford , Henry Fonda and the always reliable Dana Andrews make the film , if not a winner , at least something watchable . It is not to be ranked among the great Preminger's works though .
584031	1219578	14898	6.0	A melodrama : it has its moments	To try to find some of the seeds which produced Renoir's masterpieces of the thirties is splitting hairs . All we can say is that it shows Renoir's taste for nature , rivers , country landscapes . The heroine called Gudule ( the name has become completely ludicrous in today's France ; no one is called Gudule anymore ) is played by Renoir's favorite actress of the silent era , Catherine Hessling . Her fate is worthy of Hugo's " les miserables " : mistreated by a wicked lecherous uncle , taken in by a poacher and his mum , left in the cold and the rain . . . And finally she finds love : a nice young man falls for her and marries her . His background is very bourgeois , but the parents do not seem to bother . That is to say we are far from " Boudu Sauvé des Eaux " , " La Chienne " and even " Une Partie de Campagne " . Best moment : the heroine's nightmare ; people who know well Renoir's silent era will notice the similarities between this sequence and that of " La Petite Fille aux Allumettes " where the little match girl and her attentive escort go for a horse ride in the sky . The comparison stops here for " La Fille de l'Eau ' is very inferior to the Andersen adaptation . Actually the main influence is DW Griffith but then again Hessling is notLilian Gish . For Renoir's fans . The others might find it a bit obsolete .
582437	1219578	107497	6.0	Jed , Andy , Tracy and the jack of clubs .	The first thing to bear in mind is that there are ( like in Hitchcock's " family plot " , there the comparison ends ) TWO distinct plots : - The threesome Baldwin / Pullman / Kidman and the ominous plans of some of them . - And then a serial killer who hangs about the campus , in the college where Andy works . There's a very thin , very thin connection between the two stories , and it's a question of . . . well I will not write a spoiler . The screenplay is far-fetched , but has enough unexpected twists to sustain the interest till the very end ( yes , even the very last sequence contains a " revelation " ) But the real meat lies in one sequence . A bewildered Andy pays a visit to an old alcoholic shrew , played by Mrs Bancroft . Had she had a more important part , she ' d have stolen the show hands down . Every minute of this sequence is a lesson young actresses should pay attention to . Dig the way she delivers the line : " welcome to the club " . " Malice " is fun to watch , after a hard day's labor . Not much food for thought , but entertaining throughout
584376	1219578	35515	6.0	The four seasons	Based on the opera's libretto , the screenplay suffers for it : as it is not sung , except for one song , the story is sometimes hard to follow , although it's very slow ; for instance , in the opera , Rodolfo ( Rodolphe ) sings his pain when he learns that Mimi is terminally-ill : here he tells it to his friends much to the audience's surprise ( for they hardly heard Mimi cough once before , and that's it ) . It was reportedly based on the novel which inspired the opera but the narration is not really satisfying anyway . The story is divided into four parts : the four seasons , from Spring to Winter . Spring introduces the characters : all are artists ( painters , musicians , poets . . . ) , all are bound for glory , these are the salad days , the youth . C'est La Vie de Bohême , the bohemian life . The best scene shows Mimi and Rodolphe in Les Jardins Du Luxembourg , the happiest part of their relationship . Summer brings the Revolution , probably the 1848 one , although the movie remains extremely vague for that matter . Rodolphe , the poet , is very disappointed cause nobody wants to publish his lines . Autumn ( Fall ) is the beginning of the bad days . The pals have nothing to burn in their fireplace " except themselves " . Mimi has left Rodolphe for she does not want to be a burden for him . Winter : as the snow flies , the friends celebrate Christmas ; Mimi has become a supported woman ; she's dying and she's still in love with Rodolphe . Louis Jourdan , the most handsome French actor of the era , is the stand-out ; Maria Denis who plays Mimi was nearing 30 at the time and was already too old for her part . Supporting cast includes such first-class thespians as Louis Salou and Suzy Delair . Like this ? try these . . . . . Three comrades ( Frank Borzage ) Camille ( George Cukor ) Louise ( Abel Gance )
584271	1219578	154175	6.0	French airmail .	Like John Ford's " airmail " and Howard Hawks ' s " Only angels have wings " , " au grand balcon " deals with the heroic pilots who struggled , suffered and often died to carry the mail . Their boss ( a deadpan and seemingly insensitive Pierre Fresnay ) wants them to consider the mail as a God . George Marchal - who was often compared with Jean Marais - portrays one of these fearless daring pilots with gusto . A versatile actor , he could play sword and sandals as well as his friend Luis Bunuel ' s much more ambitious opus ( " cela s'appelle l'aurore " " la mort en ce jardin " ) . Henry Decoin ' s directing is effective and avoids pathos whereas the numerous deaths could have turned the movie into a tear jerker . Two examples : - Marchal is lost in the snow , he wants to climb higher and higher because he knows that up there he will not be buried beneath . Thus , his body will be found and his old mom will get the insurance money . This sequence abruptly ends in a way that will surprise - and maybe disappoint - the audience . - Marchal's young protégé Didier is about to die , far from his homeland , but the pilot will have to leave the deathbed before the end . " Au grand balcon " is the name of the boarding-house where the pilots live . Halfway between document and novel , the movie achieves the feat of doing without a single love interest , which was rare at the time . That said , it's not really a true Decoin movie ; This director's forte was the film noir and he will be remembered for such works as " non coupable " or " la vérité sur Bébé Donge " . " Au grand balcon " should appeal to people who like the two movies I mention at the beginning of my comment .
584608	1219578	29802	6.0	Geisha blues	Although Max Ophuls ' works of that era are not highly praised ( " Werther " " Sans Lendemain " " De Mayerling A Sarajevo " ) , they nevertheless bear the stamp of the director . These are all romantic stories with doomed lovers , be they fictitious ( the two first movies ) or historic ( the latter ) . " Yoshiwara " was made in the studio and reportedly in the Japanese Garden of the Porte de Saint-Cloud in Paris ( it was first intended to be filmed in Japan ) , and the lack of means is obvious . Rather listless in its first part , this story of love between a geisha and a Russian lieutenant features at least a great scene in the second one : " the night at the opera " . There is a similar scene in " letters from an unknown woman " when the lovers pretend they are traveling on a magic train .

585415	1219578	31600	6.0	Place your bets in Macao .	Fact : although the movie was to be released in 1939 , it was postponed to 1942 . WW2 had broken out and all Stroheim's scenes were remade with Pierre Renoir instead of the Austrian actor / director . After the liberation , the original version was shown in the theaters . Jean Delannoy , although always put down by the nouvelle vague , is a good director , whose best works were made in the fifties though ( notably his two Maigret ) . " Macao " , IMHO , is not Delannoy at his best . One can feel a lot of influences ; Marcel Carné's " Jenny " : in that work , Françoise Rosay did not want her daughter to know about her job ( go-between ) ; in Delannoy's work , Ying-Tchai ( Hayakawa ) does not want his daughter Jasmine ( Louise Carletti ) to discover he's involved in dealings and the owner of a dive ( which recalls " Forfaiture " , also featuring the Japanese thespian ) ; Von Sternberg's extravaganzas such as " Shanghai express " . Roland Toutain is miscast as the young romantic lead . The plot remains a bit confused and , except in the last pictures , Delannoy's perfect style cannot make up for it : it would have taken more madness : only the last sequence , where Hayakawa outdoes himself reaches a peak of tragic grandeur . But weren't it for that only , " Macao " would remain watchable . Besides , Mireille Balin's character is modern , a femme fatale with a down-to-earth side .
585059	1219578	53290	6.0	A few lines in the Bible . . . .	. . . and presto ! a screenplay ! I do not exaggerate : there are five or six lines given over to Sheba in the Bible . She came to visit Solomon and suggested riddles to him . Then she came back singing the king's praises . These riddles allow double entente mind you . So why not a love story between Solomon and Sheba ? In 1959 , King Vidor had nothing to prove . He had made at least a dozen of classics : " the big parade " " the crowd " and " hallelujah " are Early . " " Our daily bread " and " duel in the sun " are Middle . " Fountainhead " and " Ruby Gentry " are Late . " Solomon and Sheba " belongs to the latter phase of Vidor's brilliant career . It has not to be taken seriously but it's much fun to watch it , even if it sometimes becomes ridiculous ( all the " religious pagan " scenes , Lollobrigida praying her idol or the infamous orgy that does not equal the one which the Jews enjoy when Mosis is talking with God in " the ten commandments " ) . Lollobrigida , in spite of her Italian accent , is a superb queen . George Sanders is a delightful villain . Brynner is wearing a wig , but it does not prevent him to be fair , as the obligatory " whose-baby-is-it ? " scene shows . SPOILER : Sheba's resurrection is weird . I'm not a specialist , but it seems to me that this concept is Christian . There's not such a thing in the Old testament . Never mind . If you enjoy epics , you'll enjoy " Solomon and Sheba " .
582843	1219578	265666	6.0	break up the family . . .	Since the critical and commercial success of " Rushmore " ( 1998 ) , Wes Anderson became a promising and talented director . He's even nicknamed " Hollywood's new prodigy " . So three years after " Rushmore " , he released a new movie : " The Royal Tenenbaums " ( 2001 ) . This movie's got a whacky script ( the Tenenbaums are all gifted ) full of zany ideas and powerful cues : " he's not your father " says Gene Hackman to Gwyneth Paltrow about Danny Glover , " Neither you " she replies . But this on the level of the directing that Anderson's talent shines : it turns out to be inventive , clever and we can notice that he favors two devices : static shots and tracking shots . Moreover , it's obvious that Anderson put a lot of effort into the esthetic side of the movie : bright colors have been used on the sceneries and they're enhanced by a luminous photography . With all these advantages , " The Royal Tenenbaums " is a movie full of light and life . But in parallel , I thought that the performances were of varying quality : if Gene Hackman and Ben Stiller dominate the cast , on the other hand , Anjelica Huston and especially Gwyneth Paltrow make the movie a bit dull . Besides , her wild look annoyed me during nearly all the movie . I preferred her in " the talented Mr Ripley " ( 1999 ) . Moreover , given that she's a playwright , could she be Max Fischer's distant cousin ? ( Max Fischer was the hero of " Rushmore " and in his spare time , he wrote plays too ) . Then , I think I didn't understand one sequence : this is the last one when all the members of the Tenenbaum family are gathered to attend Hackman's funeral . What do they feel ? Happiness ? Sadness ? Indifference ? Wes Anderson doesn't really reveal us the members ' feelings about this dramatic event . Although , I don't really regard Wes Anderson as a genius , I'm obliged to recognize that he's got talent to produce movies which can be both funny and wit . So , once again : " the royal Tenenbaums " , a good movie ? Definitely . A masterpiece ? No .
585331	1219578	91270	7.0	the return of inspector Lavardin	In the middle of the eighties , it would be interesting to see what the survivors of the New Wavelet have become . Well , François Truffaut passed away in 1984 and Eric Rohmer persists in signing empty , sloppy films to show his " skills " at film-making . Her majesty Jean-Luc " God Ard " only keeps his small handful of faithful intellectual ones happy with his hermetic products like " Détective " ( 1985 ) or " je Vous Salue Marie " ( 1985 ) . Same judgment for Jacques Rivette who drive many movie-goers indifferent with his version of " les Hauts De Hurlevents " ( 1985 ) ( Wuthering Heights ) . Fortunately , there's still Claude Chabrol to deliver us a worthy , understandable film even if his production as a whole is patchy . In 1985 , " Poulet Au Vinaigre " boosted his career again and so the temptation to give it a sequel was inevitable . " Inspecteur Lavardin " is the heir of the 1985 film and features again the same main character plunged in the same bourgeois universe , in a different provincial town this time in Dinand in Brittany . He's still acted by Jean Poiret who seemed irreplaceable in this role . The writer Raoul Mons was found murdered on the beach and Lavardin has to find the culprit . His investigation is the opportunity for Chabrol to break the respectable appearance of the upper-class milieu but also to include unexpected twists about the plot , notably when Lavardin found who the murderer is . Like in " Poulet Au Vinaigre " , humor is the main motor of the film , notably with the way Lavardin employs to make his suspects talk . More than in the 1985 film , the witty personality of this maverick cop is more precise and deepened for the audience . " Inspectur Lavardin " isn't as intense as " la Femme Infidèle " ( 1969 ) or " le Boucher " ( 1970 ) but with a palatable story and good acting in the bargain , it would be a shame to skip it . In 1988 , a TV series entitled " les dossiers secrets De l'inspector Lavardin " will be launched and four installments will be shot . NB : video and TV play an important role in the film . It must have given an idea to Chabrol about the direction his next film would take : " Masques " ( 1987 ) .
584261	1219578	120449	7.0	how to deal and to improve one's life in a gritty environment	For a long time , French cinema had the bias to choose to overlook the marginalized , the social misfits who have trouble to struggle and to fit in a society . In the nineties , some French filmmakers began to get interested in these categories of ill-fated ones as Erick Zonca's tale bears witness . His chronicle of these two friends facing the harsh economic , social realities together was bestowed with prizes in 1998 , 1999 , especially at the Cannes festival where it was one of the jury's favorites . French public and press specialized in cinema gave it an ovation and the film enjoys a favorable reputation abroad , rather rightly so . The director's forte is to showcase and to assess the persona of his two young interprets . At first sight , they're a mismatched pair that everything opposes and brings together . Isabelle ( Elodie Bouchez ) : a 20 year-old young woman who brims with energy and generosity , ready to accept any job not to get bogged down in poverty including to distribute advertising leaflets on roller skates dressed in " sandwich-woman " . Beside her , Marie ( Natacha Régnier ) , bilious , mercurial dissimilar to her sidekick ( to put it mildly ) . Apart from the liking she feels for Isabelle and their friendship is a touch of light in this drab city , she's her complete antipode . She can't put up with her distressing condition , she's rather in bad terms with her mother . She even shows total egocentricity because she doesn't even go to a lot of trouble to visit her cousin Sandrine in a coma and whose mother died shortly after wards . A consequence to her profound discontentment and to her inability to come to terms with her social condition . Maybe an exit to this life for her would be to live with Chris , a rich kid with a more than comfortable living standards . She has a crush on him but the latter treats her like a ghostly girl . Erick Zonca's chronicle is composed of two parts . The first half is nearly faultless and a prime one from every angle . The director tries to capture short-term moments of bliss when the two friends are together and there's a communicative " feel-good " vibe . Zonca also deftly eschews what could make caricatured some characters like the ruffian-like bouncers . The second part veers to a doom-laden turn which even if it serves the title of the film and Marie also makes it formulaic . From the moment when Marie is enamored of Chris , the audience has to expect the inevitable . Marie's love for Chris jeopardizes her friendship with Isabelle who is very aware that Marie's lover considers her as a casual lover and leads her up the garden path . So , almost adamant feuds break out between Isa and Marie who don't manage to calmly communicate face to face . Zonca steers his film according to what the audience expects and the poise that the film created in the first half is damaged and not well dovetailed as a whole . The interest tends to dwindle and Mr Zonca , I would have liked more unexpected , less easiness but fortunately the communicative vitality , the acting full of spontaneity of the two main actresses largely stop you from dismissing this piece of work . I don't want to be a major spoiler and pour out the end . I will just say that it encompasses an upbeat , placating whiff thanks to a song discerningly chosen . " La Vie Rêvée Des Anges " is worth a watch thanks essentially to the two actresses whose performances boosted their careers . Natacha Régnier was venturesome to agree to hold difficult or trying roles later as in François Ozon's disquieting " les Amants Criminels " ( 1999 ) .
582392	1219578	59170	7.0	A lot of fun ! !	This movie looks like an erotic comic strip of the sixties . Today , it's priceless delightful trash . If you have a chance to see it - which is not easy - do not think twice . It could be the granddaddy of " pulp fiction " " Texas chain saw massacre " or " Born killers " with more humor than the three former works put together . The three girls act like men , they do not seem to like them - with the exception of the " vegetable " whom they despise anyway - . There ' re probably in love with bubble head girl Linda ( they are caricatures of the dyke in the imagination of narrow-minded people ) who spends the whole movie in bikini and whom they bind and gag with an intense pleasure ! ( Tarentino might have found the excellent bikini scene with Juliette Lewis in " from dusk till dawn " here ) . They meet a family who lives in the desert . And what a family ! a crippled ( but wealthy ) father in a wheelchair , a dumb muscle man son and another son , a two-bit hero . Russ Meyer parodies the " intellectual " westerns and the Freudian thrillers of the forties ! And even " Hud " ! Hercules cannot stand the sound of the train , and his father hates women : what do you suppose THAT means ? There's an explanation ! When I started watching " faster pussycat kill kill " , I did not expect anything ! It's not to be taken literally . But if you want something drastically different , I would never recommend it enough .
582527	1219578	53050	7.0	Resistance and whodunit .	Resistance fighter Marie-Octobre ( it's her former code name ) gathers her mates after the war . There's a traitor among them and they've got to discover him and do away with him . The audience is induced to suspect one by one all the " guests " , à la Agatha Christie . The film forgets the historical background very quick to focus on an efficient but rather artificial suspense . The good cast ( Danielle Darrieux , Serge reggiani , Bernard Blier , Paul Meurisse ) makes up for the conventional side of this story . It ' s a watchable work , but it's not representative of Julien Duvivier's greatness : he was in the last part of his brilliant career and time had begun to take its toll . But his touch is still here though .
582455	1219578	104025	7.0	crisis , what crisis ?	On the same day , Victor ( Vincent Lindon ) loses both his wife and a very lucrative job in his firm . Miserable and hopeless he's looking for his friends and family in the country to tell his personal turmoil and hoping to find some relief . But he only receives indifference or misunderstanding . Only a little man Michou ( Patrick Timsit ) is his confident and seems to be the key to solve Victor's inner trouble . Coline Serreau is known and even celebrated in France for her popular comedy " Trois Hommes et Un Couffin " ( 1985 ) with which she scored a big hit so much so that an American remake followed a couple of years later . Its follow-up , " Romuald et Juliette " ( 1989 ) didn't have as much impact . With " la Crise " , she pored over the mood of French society at the dawn of the nineties and it's a rather gloomy one . Her film could walk a fine line with works such as Gérard Jugnot's " une Epoque Formidable " ( 1991 ) . In this film , Jugnot favored laughter to assess a French society driven by financial laws and having lost human values . Coline Serreau takes back these observations and on a frenetic pace , she also relies on a sharp analysis of French society tangled up in stress and absence of communication but also politics eaten up by dishonesty and bribery . Her methodology to keep smiles on the viewer's face is shrewd : every time Victor meets someone and starts to tell him about his devilish day , he can't finish his story because his friends and family are amid their own problems and it's the opportunity for them to lay their souls bare and to express their formidable honesty and thoughts about who they really are or think . This method works but has also its evident limits in the sense that it makes the film a little monotonous and breathless by moments . But overall , Coline Serreau pulls it off with gusto to make us laugh of our woes . " La Crise " was nominated in several categories at the César awards ceremony in 1993 including Best Female Supporting Roles for Maria Pacôme and Zabou and it's a shame that they didn't catch it . The first one has only 15-20 minutes of appearance while the second one has about half an hour of presence on the screen but one clearly remembers their shows in which they demand to live their lives their own ways . In counterpart , the film garnered the César for the Best Scenario and I have my doubts about it because if Serreau's work is formidable but a little dull in its humorist conception , things go wrong in the last half hour when she adopts a conventional , cozy tone with an acceptation of naive solutions . It throws the film a little off balance and loses a part of its strength . See it anyway , its several ferociously funny moments make it worthwhile and fifteen years later , the thrust of " la Crise " is still a topical one .
583627	1219578	417071	7.0	I will tell her the blue words , the ones you tell with your eyes	Alain Corneau has been occupying a steady surge in French cinema for more than thirty years now . Topnotch thrillers like " Police Python 357 " ( 1976 ) , " Série Noire " ( 1979 ) , ambitious works with " Nocturne Indien " ( 1989 ) or " Stupeur et Tremblements " ( 2003 ) reveal his strong ability at film-making . " Le Prince Du Pacifique " ( 2000 ) , unworthy of his directing skills is perhaps the nadir of his career . " Stupeur et Tremblements " which was a triumph when it reached the streets signaled a new direction in Corneau's work . In this intimate film , a young woman ( Sylvie Testud ) was the main character and before he shot his work , stories of men were the filmmaker's specialty . " Les Mots Bleus " is an extension of Corneau's new direction in his career with once again a young woman as the main role . It was the opportunity for Corneau to work again with Testud after their fruitful alliance for " Stupeur et Tremblements " and also to deepen his set of themes partly revolving on communication . Three characters are at the core of " Les Mots Bleus " . Clara ( Sylvie Testud ) , a mercurial , neurotic mother who after she saw her grandmother died before her eyes stopped to read and is afraid of words . Her daughter Anna who is deliberately dumb . To try to cure her , her mother takes her to an institution for dumb an deaf children run by Vincent ( Sergi Lopez ) , a manager who behind his solid look reveals zones of fragility and is unable to have a lasting relation with a woman . The school methods bear fruit for little Anna who gains trust in herself although she still refuses to talk to Clara's disappointment . The latter is smitten with Vincent but is afraid to love her . Relationships the three characters weave between them partly constitute the film's attraction . Of the threesome , Anna is perhaps the more mature one ; Clara and Vincent in a way act like children . The former dreads words and can't face the world that surrounds her while the latter in his course amuses the children by aping animals ( in one sequence he apes a gorilla ) . He's also unable to link a love affair with a woman . Bit by bit , they will become easier to get on with each other . Scenery is also a vital element , notably the shed on the beach , a refugee for comforting childhood memories or the institution , a refugee for deaf and dumb children who through drawings let express what's going on in their souls . Like in Jean-Pierre Sinapi's " Nationale 7 " ( 2000 ) which took place in an institution too ( for disabled people ) , the choice of a DV camera for the sequences in the institution give the film a documentary approach and a blue-tinted cinematography serves Corneau's ideas . All in all , the real subject of the film is Clara and her reluctance to discover words and love again . " Les Mots Bleus " didn't have as much impact as its predecessor and its somewhat formulaic , slick master plan clouds its scale of masterwork in Corneau's filmography although there's nothing mawkish here . Corneau's fans may want to watch it but it's not a film to which you would want to return .
582760	1219578	75005	7.0	the possessed child round 2	For a lot of cine buffs , the masquerade of " the Exorcist " ( 1973 ) was deemed ground-breaking enough to consider this enticing fantastic film to be a benchmark in the horror / fantasy genre but I'm not one of them . Three years later , " the Omen " steps into the breach William Friedkin's standard ( for the ones who are fans of it ) opened and the detractors of the film will surely qualify it as a pale mimicry of Friedkin's film , I will definitely choose Richard Donner's work which is perhaps the finest of all his career . A filmography often characterized by action-packed stories , the likes of the " Lethal Weapon " saga . So , Donner uses again some ingredients which made the success of " the Exorcist " like the child possessed by Satan who worries his surroundings and turns them to his advantage . First , it was a shrewd idea to have located the story in the American political milieu because it prepares the final sequence and the most famous one of the whole movie with sardonic humor : Damien holding the hand of the American president and grinning at him . Evil entering the White House and as the USA is the most powerful country in the world , the latter is in jeopardy . Apocalypse now indeed . . . As for the story , it is shot in a thrifty style . Would-be chilling special effects which plagued Friedkin's film and made it farcical weren't among Donner's priorities when he shot his film . So , special effects are kept to the minimum . It doesn't mean that " the Omen " is a total masterwork . Donner has a conspicuous taste for easy effects like the death of Damien's mother and his conventional directing sometimes stops the viewer from feeling shivers in some spooky sequences . Conventional could also be the most adequate epithet to deem the storyline as a whole . But these weaknesses don't handicap too much the thrill of the vision and as I said before : a ton of special effects wasn't Donner's priority and in spite of the scheduled dramatic progression , the film is eminently watchable . So " the Omen " is a more than valuable effort than its elder brother about the child haunted by Satan . If " the Exorcist " hadn't been created , maybe Donner's film could have had the stance of yardstick . And like its elder brother , this variation of the possessed child made crowds flock to it and caused a chain of cheesy sequels and even a remake which opened on the 06th June 2006 in the world . The choice of the date is evident . What about its quality ? I will talk about it in my review devoted to it on this site .
584358	1219578	96328	7.0	this is a song Charles Manson stole from the Beatles and we're stealing it back !	When U2 arrives in the fall 1987 to start the second leg of their American tour to promote " The Joshua Tree " ( 1987 ) , they already filled with enthusiasm millions of Americans with their masterpiece and they were showered with praise by virtually all musical critics but also important newspapers ( the magazine Newsweek even put them on the cover ! ) . The amount ? Bono and his band were crowned the biggest rock and roll band in the world . A status which isn't easy to assume and when one has a rock and roll masterpiece under one's belt , delivering it a follow-up is a difficult task . Maybe that's why the most famous Irish quartet had the idea to make a film accompanied by an album : to try to forge ahead and to take a new musical direction . So , " U2 : Rattle and Hum " ( 1988 ) is a documentary which goes back over the band's tour in America where they alternate concerts and cultural discoveries ( the visit of Graceland ) . Their album " the Joshua Tree " had already expressed their fascination for America , the movie " Rattle and Hum " confirms it . The director Phil Joanou ( Martin Scorsese turned down this role ) also filled his work with interviews and recording sessions which took place after the tour in 1988 . Each member's disposition is revealed in these interviews but also throughout the movie and during their tour especially with concerts . So , in Joanou's opus , Bono and his men reaffirm their positions on a social , cultural and above all musical point of view while not forgetting their Irish roots . Concerning music which constitutes the backbone of the movie , the band explores several facets of American music . The Stax-soul tribute " Angel of Harlem " , the blues " When Love Comes to Town " with a prestigious guest : BB King , " I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For " in a gospel version show a progressive Americanization of the band . But in parallel , not to lose their identity , the four members remain faithful to their musical influences ; either it is the sinewy " Desire " or the atmospheric " Heartland " that sounds like a " the Joshua Tree " outtake . Hence an impression of hodgepodge : the tracks cut in studio are rather badly linked up . It is difficult to let oneself rock with beautiful heavenly flights then to follow with unusual tracks for the band without losing the thread . That said , the musical trimmings that somewhat hinders the movie didn't stop Bono and his men to write some of U2's best songs . On another extent , Phil Joanou's technical feats enable the spectator to attend the concerts as if he were on stage with the band . The latter is presented in this state like we would imagine them for the ones who have never seen them in concert : fiery , feverish , passionated by their music and ready to make a declaration aiming at peace in Northern Ireland and why not in the rest of the world ( Bono's words in the middle of Sunday Bloody Sunday " ) . And I address the fans of the band who may have the album but not seen the movie and the casual listeners : a good part of U2's hits of the eighties and notably from " the Joshua Tree " are performed on stage : " Bad " , " Where the Streets Have No Name " , " With or Without You " . I also think that having shot the movie in black and white and in color gives it a arty side . At the end of the day , it's a worthy but suicidal undertaking . Indeed , the limited commercial career of Joanou's opus clearly shows once again that this kind of film is seldom successful in the theaters in spite of the fact that the video was a best-seller in the Anglo-Saxon countries . And for U2 , the eighties ended in a little rough way but fortunately , the nineties will begin ( and for me end ) triumphantly with " Achtung Baby " ( 1991 ) .
583318	1219578	75118	7.0	It's hard to see this movie .	Because it deals with tortures in Algeria " la question " remains a movie few people know . Henri Alleg's small book was first sold on the sly , but by the end of the sixties you could find it anywhere : it was in the library of my teacher training college . The title ( " the question " ) is borrowed from the Middle Ages when they called torture " question " what an euphemism ! Actually the movie does not go as far as the tortures depicted by Alleg in his book . The reader will certainly know what I mean . There are scenes that cannot be transferred to the screen , and any man or woman with a heart could not certainly stand them . Even the names were changed : Alleg became Charlègue and his friend Maurice Audin was renamed Oudinot . So were the soldiers patronymics . Laurent Heynemann made a non spectacular movie , and his leading actor , Jacques Denis , remains very sparing of gestures and words as Alleg ( Charlègue ) , the director of a newspaper and a FLN ( Algerians fighting against the French army to get independence ) sympathizer . All that is left for him is his dignity and he will not bargain for salvation , which would mean informing . A very dark page of French history .
585504	1219578	354836	7.0	why can't I be you ?	Bernard Frédéric ( Benoît Poelvoorde ) devoted his life to his biggest icon Claude François , perhaps the most famous mainstream French singer in the seventies . To fully live his passion and his admiration for him , he organized provincial tours in which he sang with female dancers " Cloclo " ' s most popular songs , flanked by his associate Couscous who assured the first parts of his shows , dressed as Michel Polnareff's double . But today , galvanized by his wife Véro ( Julie Depardieu ) who forced him to choose between her or his god , his once exciting life got bogged down in a humdrum one . An employee in a bank , he also lives in a modest suburban house until one day , his former chum approaches him again to prompt him to attend a TV show about celebrity doubles . Frédéric can't withstand to the desire to attend it , dressed as Claude François . But he would have to defy the promise he made to Véro who might see this as the last straw about the future of her relationship with her mercurial man . . . What can be said about a film which enjoyed a conspicuous publicity campaign and made it a household name virtually everywhere in France ? Well , visually , it's an appealing film . The director Yann Moix retorted to a quite kitsch cinematography with often gaudy colors to recreate the aura of the Claude François mania in the seventies . A mania which is still vivacious today in Frédéric's mind and in his relentless training to be on this vital TV show about double celebrities . A quirky directing with split-screens which includes authentic footage dating from the seventies and an epileptic editing consolidates this whimsical menu . One word about the last sequence : Moix doesn't tap overflowing effects to leave the viewer speechless about the harrowing vibe the scene conveys and one forgets its formulaic character . Then , the scenario seems to have been sedately written . It's true that the scriptwriters including Olivier Dazat follow an ultra-mapped scheme to tell Frédéric's efforts to reach the TV show which seems to be the most crucial thing on earth for him . However , there's more on the paper and to the picture than meets the eye . This scenario has its moments and they are numerous like when it comes to showcase and construe Frédéric's apparently simple but complex persona . He's a lackluster man when Claude François isn't on his mind but when his passion for Claude François has the upper hand and his determination to reform his female dance band make his demeanor with his surrounding hateful , obnoxious , on the brink of the unacceptable as the sequences when he selects his female dancers and then asks her questions ( he has all the answers ) about his god bear witness . But he's especially guided by his former tour companion , Couscous , deemed as disreputable by Véro . In a way , this hare-brained Polnareff's double is his evil genius because he indirectly jeopardizes Frédéric's couple to make him resume his one-time favorite activities . It's all the more serious as Véro is deeply enamored of her man . Moreover , does headstrong Frédéric's imagination play tricks on him ? Is the sequence during which he's phoned by Claude François a dream or an hallucination ? So , the scriptwriters have penned a cohesive screenplay which concerns nearly all of us , at least the ones who have heroes in any domain in life . To which extent , can we go to fully identify oneself with a celebrity for whom one is in awe ? Could it make us cut off from the reality ? Doesn't one risk a split personality ? " Podium " was basically a novel written by Moix himself for Benoît Poelvoorde to convince him to transpose it to the silver screen and to act in it . It bore fruit . The Belgian actor , once revealed with the half-gruesome , half-wacky " C'est Arrivé Près De Chez Vous " ( 1992 ) carries an important part of the film on his shoulders and his input both in the film and in his role is visible . His charisma , François ' songs he heartily sings , the choreography are reproduced with painstaking application . But the rest of the cast isn't sacrificed . Julie Depardieu , ( Gérard's daughter ) acts her role with reserve and self-control and deftly circumvents the drawbacks her role was tending . Jean-Paul Rouve , him , keeps a part of mystery to Frédéric's sidekick and Polnareff's double . On the surface , the story of " Podium " smells the reheated but the authors had the gusto to cool it down to better entertain the viewer and to arouse essential questions about his tastes and likes . This a little oddball film should appeal to Poelvoorde's fans and to " Cloclo " ' s . And as soon as the film ends , French viewers , be prepared to hum his tunes . All together now : " Alexandrie , Alexandra " , " Des Magnolias Par Centaines ! " etc . . .

584214	1219578	118978	7.0	only God can see you Denis and only love can break your heart	Since " Versailles Rive Gauche " ( 1992 ) , the Podalydès brothers rank among the darlings of the French press and critic specialized in cinema . This movie " Dieu seul me voit " ( 1998 ) confirms it . It achieved a huge success more critic than commercial and it won the Oscar for the Best First Work in France in 1999 . I watched it recently and I thought it wasn't bad . It's obvious that the Podalydès brothers have got a certain talent as a director ( Bruno ) and as an actor ( Denis ) . Both have concocted a light and subtle movie which isn't however devoid of weaknesses . To sum up this film , someone told me this sentence : " a recording engineer drowned in his loving problems " . It can be checked in one sequence , at the end of the film , when Albert ( Denis Podalydès ) is in front of the Versailles castle after the demonstration with all the women he charmed . Otherwise , I don't think the sentence suits well to the opus . I would have chosen " a recording engineer hesitating between several loving conquests " . Moreover , Albert mainly evokes a loving Candide . Then , " Dieu seul me voit " is supposed to be a comedy . It's rather true . There are , actually two kinds of comic . Firstly , a comic that emanates from the dialogs and secondly , situation comedy . Using these two devices , Bruno Podalydès , let's admit it doesn't always hit the bull's eye but when he succeeds in it , it's a delightful result . But I also thought that most of the sequences were of varying quality : if the ones that take place in Toulouse turn out to be particularly successful , others are badly mastered : when Albert's having dinner with Anna in the " Klow restaurant " . At the end , the whole gives a nice movie even imperfect . A remark : the Podalydès brothers are big fans of Tintin and " Dieu seul me voit " contains three nods at the famous reporter : - in Albert's flat , there's a little copy of the red and white rocket . - when Albert eats out with Anna , this is the " Klow restaurant " and the waiter's got the same aspect as the one in the Tintin's album : " King Ottokar's sceptre " . - at last when Albert is at the advance poll , he wears nearly the same clothes as Tintin : a white shirt and a blue sweat shirt .
584839	1219578	56412	8.0	Fine acting , strong directing , splendid landscapes .	In the late fifties / early sixties , the crepuscular western appeared . " Ride the high country " epitomizes the genre . It keeps the old values of the old guard ( Daves , Mann , Ford ) while opening new doors ( the last scenes predate Sergio Leone style and the future Peckinpah , even if I must confess that I do not go much for his later works . There's no accounting for taste . ) " Ride the high country " has anything that makes a western worthwhile : two veterans , McCrea ( we're far from the madness of " Colorado territory " ) and Scott , getting old gracefully , a fine use of the landscapes , and two plots which hang well together : the gold powder which the two men have to take to the city and the girl who wants to marry a miner . The two stories become one in a very workmanlike way . Peckinpah's first effort " the deadly companions " , starring Ford's favorite actress Maureen O'Hara ( whom he did not like , reportedly ) is also worth watching .
583007	1219578	52708	8.0	The seeds .	Although it's Chabrol's second effort ( the first one being " le beau serge " featuring the same actors ) , this one is closer to Chabrol-as - we - know-him . The detective ending and the first steps in the bourgeois world of Brialy character herald Chabrol ' s heyday ( which begins with " les biches " , encompasses such works as " la femme infidèle " , " que la bête meure " " le boucher " " la rupture " " juste avant la nuit " and ends with " les noces rouges " ; that's not to say all the movies were great during that period : " doctor Popaul " and " la decade prodigieuse " can be forgotten " ; that does not mean there were no great works after " wedding in blood " ( les noces ) either as testify such memorable works as " Violette NOzières " , " Une affaire de femmes " or " l'enfer " . But in France the 1967-1973 era is generally regarded as Chabrol's peak , with " le boucher " , his towering achievement . So we enter the bourgeois world with Brialy's character , a bon vivant as we say in France , with parents ( whom we never see ) who provide him money and a comfortable flat . He is a student , but we never see him studying , girls and pleasures taking the best of him . In direct contrast with him , enters Blain , his provincial cousin . He comes from a much more modest background , his parents ( whom we never see either ) had certainly to struggle hard to send him to the Latin Quarter . So from the beginning , the incommunicability is total . Blain is a grind , and if sometimes he accepts to follow his life-lover cousin in not-so-intellectual places in Paris , he knows he shall not disappoint his old parents . Brialy's kind of life is bewildering for a young lad like Blain : a scene is particularly strange , baroque , and even threatening : some fascination for Nazism from Brialy and his clique during a strange party ( it's 1959 , and German occupation is not that much far behind after all ) . Chabrol has ready begun his bourgeoisie wholesale massacre : Brialy is the prototype of the bourgeois student , selfish and smug , self-confident and apolitical ( And however , 1959 , it's Algerian war ! Young French are sent to do the dirty job ) . Apolitical , such is also Blain's case , but with more excuses : after all , when you're poor . . In his autobiography " le ruisseau des singes " , Brialy told that Chabrol ( and the producer ) had planned an happy end with the two cousins running across the fields , reconciled . Both endings were filmed , and finally the two actors urged Chabrol to renounce this silly conclusion . Hence an almost Hitchcockian ending , Hitchcock whose influence will grow over the years in Chabrol's work .
582994	1219578	45700	8.0	Girls school	The last good adaptation of a Stanislas Andre Steeman novel ( " 18 Fantômes " ) for the screen , ( Clouzot's ones were the best : " Quai Des Orfèvres " " L'Assassin Habite Au 21 " ) , " Dortoir des Grandes " ( = - big - girls dormitory ) remains one of Henry Decoin's best movies in the fifties . The director is at ease with a detective story which includes film noir touches and a lot of good humor . Jean Marais portrays a very handsome cop who investigates in a girls school where a murder was committed ( one of the students ) . A bevy of gorgeous young girls makes his work worthwhile , but they are not paragons of virtue , as the straight headmistress ( a wonderful Denise Grey ) thinks they are . Don't they dress up as ghosts at night to scare the supervisor ? And one of their pastimes the " tied - up " game - one of the girl learned in England , in France we do not do such things of course ! - consists of tying a girl to her bed : if she can free herself during the night , she wins ! And what about the victim ? Doesn't she own a movie-camera ? And if she films the turkey waddling on the yard , she has also immortalized very bad things which happen behind the teachers ' back . A gallery of weirdos have detailed portraits in " Dortoir Des Grandes " : a female maths teacher who seems to be fond of girls ( she says : " I couldn't kill her ! I wouldn't destroy beauty " ) , a supervisor who's afraid of everything , a headmistress overtaken by events ; and in the village , a photograph ( Louis de Funès ! ) who likes to take photographs of the young ladies in swimsuit till something better comes along . . . Jeanne Moreau as a servant who is asked by the cop to spy on the victim's soon-to-be stepfather ( this charming man has already tried to rape his stepdaughter ) . This is an exciting thriller , which displays a lot of dynamism , with an excellent final scene which will remind old viewers of prize giving day . Like this ? try these . . . .

582654	1219578	83947	8.0	Zinnemann's swansong is beautiful ! no , wonderful ! ! !	When the movie was released in the early eighties , it was difficult to realize that the man who made this gem is the same that , many years ago , had done " high noon " " act of violence " or " from here to eternity " . It was also hard to accept Connery in such an intimate , sensitive part . Zinnemann , who was - unfairly - criticized by European critics for being " academic " " Hollywoodian " directs here a true European movie , far from the fashions , as far from Hollywood artifacts as it can be . The equivalent of John Huston's last movie " the dead " , it's one of the most moving swansongs in the seventh art history . SPOILERS Sean Connery portrays a middle-aged man , who at first sight seems very nice , but he ' s got a wife who's much younger than him . . . Little by little , with flashbacks , we learn the truth : this young woman , Kate , is not his wife but his lover . But there's more . The center of gravity of the movie is the discovery of a body in the mountains . Ice has preserved the dead man's youth and the scene when his former love , a woman who seems older than the mountains , sees this fixed face is absolutely mind-boggling . One thinks of the sequences in Pomp��i in Rosselini's " Viaggio in Italia " This incident is not irrelevant : it reveals Connery character's harshness and selfishness when he says to the young guide ( Lambert Wilson ) that they're not in a hurry to bring back the body to the village . This is a movie with few dialogues , where looks are more important than words . The splendid cinematography enhances the mountains which will outlive everyone and make human feelings futile and fleeting . From here to eternity , they will stand , but as the guide tries to say to the heroine , life is too precious to be spoilt The ending is as stunning as Huston's " the dead " conclusion : Connery and Wilson set off to climb a dangerous mountain , one of them fall , but the camera only shows tiny figures in the landscape . Who's dead ? Kate ' s mad running across the snow , the white snow , will haunt you long after you ' ve seen the movie . Elmer Bernstein's music is an also asset and you will appreciate it till the final credits . Wonderful .
582460	1219578	35001	8.0	Quintet	" Lumière d'Ete " is probably Grémillon's most ambitious work . Made during the Occupation days , many people consider it his best . One should add it's also his less accessible . Although it's a Prévert / Laroche screenplay , the main influence here is Renoir's . All that concerns Paul Bernard's character and his fete in the castle strongly recalls " La Règle du Jeu " . Probably the center of gravity of the movie , this memorable sequence of the farandole - while the tragedy is impending - will find an equivalent in Prévert / Carné's ending of " Les Enfants Du Paradis " . There are only five characters : three men and two women . Cri-Cri ( Madeleine Renaud , Grémillon's favorite actress ) , her lover Patrice and a failed painter ( Pierre Brasseur ) represent the bourgeois society . Michèle ( Madeleine Robinson ) and Julien ( Georges Marchal ) are the working class heroes . The latter thoroughly deserves this name , in every sense of the term . Patrice is a perverse man with a racy - and even criminal - past who does not love Cri-Cri anymore : did he ever love her anyway ? or was he just pretending because she knew too many bad things about him ? A man of leisure , he invites Roland ( the artist ) in his castle just because he desires his partner Michele . In direct contrast to that , we have the working men : they are building a dam and they are useful . And they are here when it comes to lend a helping hand . There's a good use of the " play in the play " trick ; During the costume ball , Roland is disguised as Hamlet , which makes sense . Outside Shakespeare , Laroche and Prevert hint at French writer Comtesse de Ségur , since Cri-Cri's hotel is called " L'Ange Gardien " ( The guardian angel ) and one of the guests thinks of dressing up as General Dourakine . With all its qualities , " Lumière d'Eté " is less appealing than " Pattes Blanches " where Paul Bernard plays a squire again : the first third of the 1943 work drags on a bit and may put off some viewers . Nonetheless , it is essential viewing for anyone interested in the French cinema .
583452	1219578	91605	8.0	a cursed abbey in the mountains . . .	Jean Jacques Annaud is a film-maker with a daring character . After he shot this medieval thriller and among the plans he made , he made " the Bear " ( 1988 ) with wild animals as stars and he got down to adapt the Marguerite Duras ' novel " the Lover " in 1992 and however , Duras ' works are difficult to adapt for the screen . No , back in 1986 , to adapt Umberto Eco's voluminous book was no small matter . On top of the detective plot , the work comported a theological reflection and a philosophical richness . They could be sufficient enough to lead the viewer astray . Jean Jacques Annaud seemed very aware of it . That's why he preferred to erase the quoted topics for an investigation à la Conan Doyle with a passionating enigma which is arguably more accessible in the spectator's eyes . Like Christian Slater and to reassure oneself , we rely on Sean Connery's wisdom and insight because we move in an isolated and mysterious place where lives a gallery of disturbing religious characters . The whole is scattered with beautiful pictures and a certain humor adds to the interest of the film . The director also found place to denounce the Inquisition with its unfair methods . Umberto Eco may have judged the adaptation of his novel as too simplistic but the public gave it an ovation in 1987 . If you are interested in Annaud's cinema , don't miss this movie .
582462	1219578	151785	8.0	And when the night is cloudy . . . .	Gabin won the Volpi Cup at the Venice film festival and he thoroughly deserved it . " La Nuit est mon Royaume " , in spite of occasional snatches of melodrama , is a strong film about blind people . The title tells the whole story : the night is my kingdom ( and not my hell ) . In the film , all the blind people lead a normal life , they work , they love , they suffer , but above all , they do not want any pity . That was Raymond's family's first mistake : after an accident which made him a blind man , the hero is treated like a child . " He's going to break my glasses ! " mama says " You should eat more . Do you want me to cut your meat ? " . But fortunately , a nun comes to his rescue . She works in a center where blind people learn to read with the Braille alphabet , but , as the sister tells Raymond , they learn any job they like : cabinet-makers , mechanics , cooks , etc . She will play for Raymond the role Annie Sullivan played for Helen Keller . And there's another light that shines on Raymond : in the center , there's a blind schoolteacher he falls in love with . But she's the head's fiancée . This rivalry is perhaps the weakness of the film , but it does produce a marvelous scene : Raymond and the girl are walking though the wood and he confides in her ; the jealous suitor is here but of course they cannot see him . Georges Lacombe was a talented director with a good sense of mystery ( which surfaces in this film ) . He made the best of a good cast : Gabin , Simone Valère , Suzanne Dehelly , Gérard Oury - yes the director who hit the big time with his Bourvil / De Funès comedies - . His movie displayed humanism , close to that of Christian-Jaque and Jean-Paul Le Chanois : a splendid sequence shows a choir of blind people singing " Ce N'Est Qu'un Au Revoir " ( = " Should auld acquaintance be forgot ? ) . Charles Spaak ' s dialog , by and large , rings true . Like his colleague Henri Jeanson , he laughed at the Legion d'Honneur . After his pompous speech about Raymond's courage , the minister is in a hurry to leave , much to the hero's brother-in-law's disappointment , he who was counting on him to get a promotion in his bank .
584807	1219578	409184	8.0	life isn't a long quiet river	So , here's one of the most anticipated movies of the year 2005 and the sequel to one of the biggest French hits in 2002 : " l'Auberge Espagnole " which also acts as a commendable and valuable ambassador for French cinema abroad , " les Poupees Russes " . Lucid , the director Cédric Klapisch didn't opt for " l'Auberge Espagnole 2 " . Anyway one can't renew the Erasmus stay ( which I am currently experiencing ! ) a second time . " Les Poupees Russes " has nothing in common with the corny sequels that Hollwood cinema has been cramming us for years . And as Francis Veber once said : " what is a sequel ? It's generally a shoddy remake of the original movie " . So Cédric Klapisch finds again his character of Xavier and undertook to tell his life in his early thirties . Five years after his experience as an Erasmus student in Spain , he is back . He had said in the first movie : " my life has always been a mess and will always be . . . " . These words appear to be visionary . His life is far from satisfying him : he has become a writer but he has to pen biographies of celebrities and scenarios for mawkish sitcoms . His private life is hardly better : he struggles hard to find the perfect girl though his charismatic part . In short , it's a rather murky life and have a look at the cover of the film . It depicts Xavier who moves forward , with a puzzled air . He is surrounded by pretty girls . Which one is the the perfect one ? And anyway , does the perfect girl exist ? And why do we have to love just one girl and not several ones . These are some the questions that Klapisch raises and doesn't bring a definitive answer to them . It's up to the audience to think about them on account of Klapisch's piece of work . If Klapisch had built " l'Auberge Espagnole " from start to finish with as a source , his memories of cinema student in New York and her sister's who lived one year in Spain with other European fellows under the same roof , here one has to look in Truffaut's filmography for his credentials , more specifically the Antoine Doinel saga . Truffaut had shot in a series of films , the evolution of his favorite hero in his professional and private life . With " les Poupees Russes " , it seems that we also have this beginning of device with so far better results for I am not really a Truffaut devotee . Would Xavier be the Antoine Doinel of the 2000's ? Anything goes . . . Klapisch has his own trademark to shot the life or rather the various difficulties of his main figure and one is happy to realize that his film writing still works wonders . " Les Poupees Russes " looks like a sequel of a little maladjusted play lets in which Xavier tries to order a life eventually beyond his control . These play lets encompass a great thickness in their writing and a visual richness , the whole with a dash of humor and nostalgia . Their chief force is honesty : a substantial number of situations rings true and it's highly likely that the viewer has already known some of the filmed circumstances . And there's always this typical feature from the director to make a trite situation a dense one . One word about the cast : it's a topnotch one . Romain Duris shines in a part that was tailor-made for him . He has never been so good with Klapisch . All his European sidekicks are present with a special mention to Kelly Reilly and Kevin Bishop as William , the future married in a more subdued part than in " l'Auberge Espagnole " . He has found a soul mate and matured in spite of an explosive apparition : " Hello Paris ! Bonjour Paris ! " . After the bitter memory left by Klapisch's adventure in the film noir with " Ni Pour Ni Contre ( Bien Au Contraire ) , 2003 " , the year 2005 saw him on clover again with a forte he had tapped in " le Péril Jeune " ( 1994 ) : a right chronicle on young people of different ages and an accurate appraisal of their feelings . " Les Poupees Russes " constitutes the second opus of a more than estimable duo . Will there be a third chapter on Xavier's life ?
583531	1219578	143170	8.0	We're captive on the carousel of time . . . . . ( Joni Mitchell )	. . . . we can't never return , we can only look behindFrom where we came And go round and round and round in the circle game . When I began to watch " La Cavalcade des Heures " , I was not expecting much ! I was almost immediately enthusiastic about it . La Cinémathèque Française owns a copy and it's really too bad this work should not get out of that place and at last be screened on the French cultural channel Arte . " La Cavalcade des heures " , like Carné ' s " Les Visiteurs du soir " ( in spite of veiled hints at the Occupation ) , Cocteau-Delannoy's " L'Eternel Retour " or Lherbier's " La Nuit Fantastique " is escapist stuff . And it magnificently succeeds . Probably inspired by Fritz Lang's " Dër Müde Tod " , it is , along Albert Valentin's contemporary works , the lost gems of the French cinema of the days of the Occupation . Prologue : An expressionist film set ( which , again shows Lang's influence ( " Metropolis " ) ) sets the tone : the one thing man will never master is Time . It reigns over the world and from time to time an hour comes to man's rescue . We will follow one of them , Hora . Segment one or " If life's for living then what's living for ? " A working man is sleeping . Rude awakening . First the alarm clock then the clocks . . . ticking . . . Ticking . . . It's just a routine day , but the man begins to think that he is caught in a trap . . . . four minutes for breakfast . . . Then the tube ( subway ) . . . then the factory where he repeats the same gesture 3 , 000 times or more a day . . . Segment two or " Getting old and running out of time " : A state employee realizes how empty his life was with a shrew of a wife ( portrayed by the marvelous Jeanne Fusier-Gir ) Segment three or " The time has come " . A glorious champion was given flowers by a lady ( Hora ) every time he won the race . But one day she makes him comprehend his time is almost through and he ' s got to hand the torch to someone else . Segment four or " these precious minutes " . A lady ( Gaby Morlay ) comes to visit her ( very young ) son in a boarding-school . She's in a hurry , eager to meet her lover , but Hora holds back the hands of the clock and she is an hour late . Too late for her lover who is about to be arrested . Segment five or " Brother can you spare a dime ? " . In spite of Fernandel's presence , this sketch is the weakest , some equivalent of the game of golf in " dead of night " , a comic relief which is too derivative . Segment six or " time waits for no one " . A rich owner of a night club feels sick when he comes home late at night . He takes to his bed , Hora is here . " It's your last hour " she says . The man ( Charpin ) is only fifty and he wants to live more ( " Half a century " she says " think of it ! many men are not so lucky ) . Like in the old Egyptian religion , then begins some kind of weighing of the soul where even the ghost of his late mother comes back . . . . There's nothing to do about it when your time has come . . . DepressingSegment seven or " Where have all the good times gone ? " : this one is the most brilliant . Charles Trénet was never as moving , as good and as charming . . . He portrays a man who seems to have anything : fortune , fame , women aplenty ; one night he invites an old poor woman , who is begging for food in the streets . He treats her to the delights of champagne and caviar . He opens up and tells his frustrations , his regrets , he calls her " Grandmother " and longs for a childhood long gone . Then the haunting melody of " Que Reste-t-il de Nos Amours " is not far from driving the viewer to tears . That's here that the song belongs , not in some of Truffaut's flicks ( that new wavelet director even stole the title of his movie from that superb song ( " Baisers volés " ) ) Segment eight or " You can't beat time " . A man was sentenced to death and he waits for the executioner in his cell . Then comes Hora . The desperate prisoner asks for a reprieve , crying it was not his fault and he was a victim of destiny . We're closer to Lang's " Der Müde Tod " than ever . Hora helps him to escape but she knows that his attempt is doomed . As he drives his car at a dizzying speed , she gives him a cigarette . The condemned man's last smoke . . . . A wheel rolls on the road ( Claude Sautet will use this picture for the first scene of " Les Choses de la Vie " ) Hora comes back there where time reigns over man , eternal captive on the carousel of time . A great film ! Should not be missed . I'd like to see more films of Yvan Noé ! !
584672	1219578	47925	8.0	Leaving the bourgeoisie and its discreet charm . . . .	This must be one of Bunuel's most accessible works . It's often hard to find the master's touch but , although it sometimes recalls Italian neorealism ( all that concerns Sandro's family ) , the picture of the Christ - the only element of surrealism in the whole work - signals Bunuel's inimitable talent . Georges Marchal , who was good friend with the director , portrays a charitable doctor , almost what we could call a secular saint . He's got a practical mind and he does what Nazarin and Viridiana will try to do in the name of God . He is l'Honnête Homme , in the Bunuelesque sense of the term . Religion is not part of his life and however , he is always around when it comes to lending a hand to his fellow men . The man of God , the priest is also here , but he's in the boss's bourgeois house : when the distraught Sandro ( Gianni Esposito ) comes to him , he tells him " go back home , my son " , when the poor man has got no more house and wife . The movie tells the story of a man leaving slowly but inexorably the discreet charm of the bourgeoisie . First step is falling for a woman who is not part of his milieu ( Lucia Bosé ) . Second step is breaking up with his wife ( and his father-in-law ) . Third and final step is refusing to become an informer and finally joining his friends , all working class men . Georges Marchal gives an effective warm performance . His character is very close to the one he will play in Bunuel's French follow up " La Mort en Ce Jardin " . That raider might possibly be the doctor estranged from his country , milieu and family . Both have got a practical mind : in " La Mort En ce Jardin " , Marchal lights a fire with the pages of the Bible . Bunuel's obsessions are still here : the mistreated donkey , the girl raped by her grandfather , the boys playing at soldiers and blindfolding one of them before shooting him . But they do not seem to matter much next to the hero's line of thought : this be called the dawn of his life .
584251	1219578	43465	8.0	Detective stories	French critic and director Bertrand Tavernier wrote : how can somebody find interest in cheesy theater à la Jean Delannoy like " detective story " ? ( in " 50 ans de cinéma américain " ) He was twice wrong 1 ) Jean Delannoy is , although academic , a very competent director . 2 ) " detective story " is a very absorbing work , with a sensational Kirk Douglas , who runs the whole gamut of emotions . Douglas portrays a pure cop but one hard on himself and the others . He perhaps gives the best performance of a detective in a movie . He gets strong supports from William Bendix , Lee Grant , Eleanor Parker and Cathy O'Donnell . There are so many subplots that it fits Wyler style like a glove . Many things happen at the same time , and only the " Best years of our lives " director could use the depth of field to such startling effects . A scene is hardly over , another one begins , and almost all the action concentrates in the stifling atmosphere of a police station , during an afternoon . By the time the night has fallen , everything is over . A lot of subjects are on the screen : from an old lady complaining they're building atomic bombs in her neighborhood , to the problems of abortion-it was a courageous move for the time - . The young lad , whom O'Donnell tries to save , recalls the characters of " the best years of our lives " : he was a soldier for five years during WW2 , and because , in a moment of distraction , he stole money from his boss , his life might be ruined . William Wyler's direction is stunning and flawless . I wish Tavernier could make movies that stand the test of time as well as this one .
583628	1219578	206396	8.0	Le Visiteur du Soir	Immediate background : Dréville's 1944 weepie " la Cage aux Rossignols " was a blockbuster in the Occupation years . It featured the boys choir " les Petits Chanteurs A La Croix de Bois " playing boarders in a reformatory . It was such a huge success it was remade some years back as " les Choristes " . " Le Visiteur " features " Les Petits Chanteurs . . . " again . They are cast as boarders of an orphanage . A rehash ? Pas du Tout . Whereas " La Cage aux Rossignols " is a dated tear-jerker , " Le visiteur " is a somber meditation on heroes and villains , on childhood's lost illusions ; it is Jean Dreville's most satisfying movie , and one of Pierre Fresnay's unfairly forgotten parts . Around midnight at the orphanage . . In the corridors of the house , in the darkest night , up comes a man . Dréville , from the very start of his story , creates a mysterious haunting atmosphere . Who is this man ? For the headmaster , it's the second coming ! The messiah ! He'd always told him he would come back some day . He was the pride of the orphanage , a former pupil who became a celebrated lawyer . He is a God , no less . . . There's in the house a place dedicated to him , with his pictures , flowers , decorations . . . It looks like an oratory ! But the hero is not the one you think he is ; the Police are hot on his heels , and he is looking for a refuge . Jean-Bernard Luc's screenplay avoids all the traps ( no love scenes : the one woman who appears for a five-minute scene is a bitch and an informer ; no easy way out : no miscarriage of justice , no wrong man trick ) and is as demanding as a good film noir should be . For the headmaster , it would be terrible , unthinkable to tell his pupils the man they admire is a criminal ; " I leave you the legend " Pierre Fresnay says before his night begins . These children , who live in a fairy tale , which becomes a thriller in which they are involved , these children who have no fathers to admire desperately need a model . The scene on the train in Paris is revealing . They would give everything to ride this train with their hero . And when the cops capture him , they help him to escape . Sauval ( check the name : it looks like the French verb " sauver " ( save ) ) has not become a criminal overnight . He's always been one . To climb the social ladder rung by rung , he had to push the others out of his way ; he was not a lawyer who , like a knight from the MIddle Ages , used to protect widows and orphans . Even children were his victims . And even the money he sent to his old school was dirty money . . . But he and the headmaster will arrange things so that nobody among the children can hear the awful truth . One of the boarders , more mature , knows more things than his pals . A sublime shot shows the young teenager watching a bird in a cage , then shedding a tear . Maybe he , too , will pretend the legend is intact . He needs it . The boys choir sings two French folk songs " A la Claire Fontaine " and " Trois Jeunes Tambours " and the French version of " Auld Lang Syne " as a moving finale .
583432	1219578	175503	8.0	The shameless old lady	Although Pierre Fresnay is at the top of the bill , the actual star of " Le Briseur de Chaines " is sixty-year-old Marcelle Geniat portraying a centenarian with a lot of make - up and an absolutely extraordinary talent . A lady the average viewer of French oldies has seen many many times without perhaps noticing her ( notably Duvivier's " L'Homme Du Jour " and " La Belle Equipe " ) . This lady had her day : it was her triumph and she outshone all the cast , be they Pierre Fresnay , Blanchette Brunoy or Ginette Leclerc . Although labeled " comedy " , " Le Briseur de Chaines " is a harsh work , sometimes verging on human tragedy ( the old lady dying while the youngsters are dancing a farandole ) . A village is about to celebrate their centenarian's feast . In fact , she is only an attraction , something the inhabitants want to show to attract the tourists ( the sign which reads : " to see the centenarian , follow the arrow ) , they do not really care about her . Around her , the family begins to fragment at the edges . The old woman's son wants to choose his children's and nephews's spouses . Then comes a circus with a handsome tamer ( Fresnay ) riding his horse , like some hero of a faraway land . These people mean getting away from this place , sailing away from this cupid narrow-minded bourgeois mean word . The old lady remembers her hundred years and realizes that a life does not measure out in years : hers was a monotonous humdrum life , and the only moments of pleasure she knew were those she spent long ago with a man from that circus " LE BRISEUR DE CHAINES " ( chain breaker ) . And she will break the chains , the ties that bind , and rebel against her family : she " marries " one of the girl to the tamer but she fails with another boy , Laurent , who cannot make up his mind to follow the lovely brunette of the circus ( Ginette Leclerc ) . This shameless old lady her family wants to take to bed on the night of the circus show ( A circus comes every thirty years , I can't afford the luxury to wait ! ) , and make a honorable speech in front of her 147 descendants had to wait to be a hundred years to take a rebel stand . As the lovers are riding away from this mean place , she waves goodbye at her window , after her own grandson has tried to close all the shutters of the inn ( " I'm not still dead ! " ) This is a wonderful movie of the Occupation years , this side of ' Le Corbeau " or " La Vie De Plaisir " ) Like this ? Try these . . . . " Make way for tomorrow " , Leo McCarey 1937 " La Vieille Dame Indigne " , René Allio 1970 " Buon natale , buon anno " Luigi Comencini 1989 " Stanno tutti bene " Giuseppe Tornatore , 1989
584011	1219578	1155621	8.0	Defiant , pacifist , witty . . . .	. . . . Arletty was all this and more ; my favorite French actress , she possesses a voice you cannot mistake for another one . I second to everything my good friend writer's reign wrote . This Docu focuses on Arletty's salad days and on the war years followed by the sad days of the " epuration " . Only five minutes were given over to her fifteen last professional years ; we are told she triumphed on stage ( they say Brando loved her portrayal of Blanche Du Bois " in Williams play ) and had to content herself with supporting parts , which is untrue . she played several leading parts , notably in " Portrait d'Un Assassin " " L'air De Paris " " L'amour madame " and mainly in two films the French critics have recently restored to favor : Jacqueline Audry's - who was long before Varda , THE female director of the French cinema - " Huis Clos " ( " no exit " from Sartre ) and " Gibier De Potence " . Apart from this , the film does the great actress justice . Frederic Mitterrand , the late president's nephew and an historian , and Jean-Claude Brialy complain about the way she was treated after the war ; she was , as Mitterrand cleverly states , a WW1 child , her first love was killed on the first day of the massacre , then she decided she would not have a child cause a child is bound to be a soldier ( she would have an abortion in the thirties ) . She expresses her disgust for war and above all , her disgust for " holy " war ! And Mitterrand points out that Alexandre Trauner - who would work with Billy Wilder and other American luminaries - who was a Jew would have been sent to the concentration camps if it hadn't been for Arletty's protection ; the same goes for poet Tristan Bernard . After the liberation , some could not forget she had a German lover ; many artists were in trouble too : Sacha Guitry , Ginette Leclerc , Henri-Georges Clouzot ; the " épuration " was so absurd a " clean " film such as " le Ciel est à Vous " was deemed " pétainist " . Arletty was never an informer , and it's obvious she tried to save as many people as she could . Like Madame Tallien during the 1793-94 Terror years of the French Revolution . Some day , they will make a movie based on her life .
584074	1219578	58700	8.0	A vampire's nightmare	Richard Matheson's " I am legend " is , along with " The incredible shrinking man " , his finest hour . His decline is all the more blatant in " stir of echoes " . " I am legend " features three parts ( January 1976 , March 1976 , June 1978 ) and an epilogue ( January 1979 ) . Do not let the titles fool you : it's a timeless story . As the hero in " shrinking man " is reborn and thus preserves the reader from despair , the conclusion of " legend " completely renewed the vampire tales by making man THE enemy . Man will become a legend , the one the new creatures will tell their sons and daughters when the dark comes . Man will become an old superstition . The collective unconscious . " The last man on earth " , unlike Boris Segal's " omega man " based on the same novel , is an accurate adaptation of the book . Its bleak black and white leaves Charlton Heston's urban landscapes far behind . Vincent Price gives a sober performance , and since he's often alone on the screen , is all the more moving . Whereas Boris Segal shows Heston watching " Woodstock " in a desert theater ( because he needs to see crowds , he who ' s on his own in LA ) , and thus horribly dates his movie , Ubaldo Ragona shows Neville watching amateur films of his dear past ( his daughter's birthday party , scenes , unlike " Woodstock " , anybody can relate to . ) . He carries on with a flashback , which begins with Neville . . . . filming what we've seen before . An emotionally powerful sequence shows Neville watching the fires which are burning in the dark night : one of them is his daughter's dead body ( " there're my children too , a soldier says ! ) Too few people people know " last man . . . " . If you've read the book , do not think twice . And if you've seen the movie , you've got to read the novel .
583780	1219578	35521	8.0	Once upon a time . .	It's the only Carné-Prévert movie that takes place in another era , the Middle Ages . During the German occupation , it was an alibi : the Devil was meant to represent Hitler and the two lovers the Resistance . But for the people at the time , their hints at French plight were so disguised - or else , it would have been banned by the censorship - , they only saw the escapist movie which they did need . Over the years , the movie has lost some of its charms : after a brilliant introduction , the pace remains too slow and it's hard to believe that Alain Cuny and Marie Déa are eaten with desire . As always in Carné's movies , it's the supporting cast that walks out with the honors : Arletty is as splendid as ever in her androgynous beauty , and Jules Berry is ideally cast as the Devil . Though it remains inferior to " le jour se lève " and " les enfants du paradis " , " les visiteurs du soir " is a curiosity for French movies buffs . People who like it should see " l'éternel retour " , a collaboration between Jean Delannoy and Jean Cocteau . NB : " Children of paradise " also takes place in another era , the nineteenth century ; sorry .

Susan Sarandon and Nick Nolte - in spite of his fake Italian accent - give superlative performances . That moment when Nolte is crying in his stairs is one of the most harrowing desperate scene I have ever seen . What's really extraordinary is that we do not always side with the parents . Sometimes , we think they are monsters to carry on a pointless fight . Sometimes we think that maybe the nurse who reads the fairy tale as if she were reading grocery's lists might be right . Two people who did not know anything about biology ( aside from what we learn in high school ) and who become capable of arguing against leading medical experts after studying books night after night deserve our undivided attention . " Laurenzo " is not an easy movie to watch ; it's not what you would call " entertaining " . For this family , the famous sentence " life is a daily struggle " takes on a terrible meaning . Recommanded .
584078	1219578	98532	8.0	no love , no future , a desire for revenge	Iris is a young Finnish girl whose life has no horizon . She works in a match factory and still lives at her parents ' . She escapes by reading soppy love stories or by attending a dance . One night , she thinks she has found Prince Charming . But the latter reveals himself a scornful human being who has no consideration for her . Then , she is chased away by her parents and relies on her brother's generosity to put her up . But Iris didn't say her last word and she decides to prepare a plan to have a revenge on the ones who couldn't love her . In the nineteenth Century , Andersen , a Danish writer wrote a tale entitled " the little match girl " . Here , the film-maker Aki Kaurismäki kept certain elements of this tale to create in his own way , a sort of updated version . And it's a much more austere one so much that it virtually evokes Robert Bresson's cinema . This is how I perceive " the Match Factory Girl " ( 1990 ) : a cross between a modernized version of Andersen's tale and Bresson's cinema for the straight-forward style and the intense austerity in which the story bathes . Aki Kaurismäki seems to have understood that to give his movie a big dramatic intensity , ostentation and exaggeration were to be excluded . The amount ? A grievous movie which hurts where everything in the cinema writing is reduced to simplicity , nearly stillness and despair . This , to better express the dreary world in which Iris is prisoner and the wrong hopes she comes up against . Barely camera movements ( the movie nearly looks like a succession of paintings ) , sinister scenery , blue-green lighting , dumb or merciless characters blend themselves to create a universe impenetrable to happiness . To plunge more in this desolate world , Kaurismäki nearly shot a silent movie , only scattered by laconic and reduced in the extreme dialogs . But to tell the truth , dialogs are not the most important thing . Looks matter more and reveal best the characters ' thoughts and feelings . The director's sympathy towards Iris and making her put up at her brother's are the only pities he shows and his movie would be of a total blackness if there wasn't humor . A humor which acts in an ironic way : " I came to tell you goodbye . . . " . Overrall , this grave movie about the lack of love strikes right at the heart and its vision is rather difficult . If you are down in the dumps , save it for a better day . It's a short movie ( hardly an hour ) but Iris ' pale and retiring countenance stays rooted for a long time in the spectator's brain . And Kati Outinen , impressive of fragility and sensitiveness is perfect in this role .
582536	1219578	115744	8.0	evening glory	Grimley , a small mining town in the Yorkshire is at death's door . The pit which constitutes for many blue collars their sole course of action ( even their " raison d'être " ) is on the brink of closing down . A good number of them gathers to play in a brass band , the Grimley Colliery Band , led by Danny , a tubercular but steady conductor who devotes in it all his energy and this is where things go askew . If Danny advocates an intensive training and demands from his fellows more investment , his occasional musicians are more preoccupied by the impending closing down of the pit . And the arrival of a young woman , Gloria who works for the governmental agency who has to cut off the jobs antagonized many members . Then , in the space of a few days , things happen quickly : the minors choose to vote for voluntary unemployment , the pit closes down but in the meanwhile , the band wins several musical competitions which enable them to attend the finale in the prestigious Royal Albert Hall . It's a momentum concert to enable them to express their plight and their anger against Thatcherism . The director Mark Herman chose to locate his half-comic , half-tragic film in a prickly British era so as to stress the ravages of Thatcherism on the mining industry and to make the audience feel how much thousands of minors suffered by finding themselves jobless overnight . There are echoes with Ken Loach's cinema : the gloomy setting , a category of workers ( here , minors ) with a more than modest living standards and the same committed side to sympathize with their plight . However , Herman's piece of work contains a good dose of humor and it's not a free choice from the director to have incorporated it into his scenario . The very last sequences with their false air of happy-end and the rueful background would convey an impending sorrow . Herman perfectly understood that it was vital to include this component because the end of the film will abandon these castoffs to their fate . This indispensable humor usually linked with the brass musical sequences and cleverly tapped in the way it precedes according a more or less lapse of time a raw or gritty scene stops the movie from falling in a desperate blackness and paves the way to a formula Herman applied with gusto here : mix slightness with gravity . Inthis respect , his directorial style works wonders like this ingenious alternate editing in one scene when we see the orchestra play and the tension which arises in the put office and the declarations made by the manager to the journalists . But Herman's directing often rises to the occasion , notably during one of the key-moments : the finale scene . His camera , either makes itself as inconspicuous as possible to let the musicians take advantage of this moments either aerial to enhance it . Symbols are also the director's forte : the billiard ball which eventually succeeds in falling in the hole anticipates the film's finale whereas Phil's empty house after the bailiffs ' coming and the withdrawal of his wife and children reflects his despondent state of mind . Herman also shelved certain narrative conventions : the end of the film in which we don't smell any odor of " happy end " diverts the codes of the success story : these minors and occasional musicians will have won the national competition and known their hour of glory but it won't alter the murky future that awaits them . In a way the viewer identifies himself to the audience in the Royal Albert Hall : bitter , helpless and Danny's speech is of a harrowing speech . Then , in another extent , look at the love Andy ( Ewan McGregor ) feels for Gloria . Where a Hollywood director would have filmed their love affair from the beginning , Herman is more astute at this game and proceeds by small touches : we only sees close-ups of McGregor and lets the suggested filter through . The 2 young people will exchange their first kiss only in the very last sequence . It would be a crime to pass over the topnotch and true to life cast . The actors take their roles with an admirable easiness and naturalness . A special mention to Pete Dopplewaite , a chameleon actor who displays once again his exceptional gifts of actor ( remember the eerie Kobayoshi in Bryan Singer's " Usual Suspects , 1995 ) and Ewan McGregor whose career was buoyed the year the movie was open thanks to Danny Boyle with " Trainspotting " ( 1996 ) . It's just a shame that a certain Manicheism taints a little the film in the relationships between Gloria's boss and her ( he isn't treated as a caricature but the way he treats Gloria makes him an obnoxious character ) but it's minor quibble . " Brassed Off " is a wonderful piece of work straddling between laughter and emotion . When British cinema is able to incorporate laughter in a thorny social situation , it can shine and Mark Herman's flick is a good example , see it at any costs !
583933	1219578	58329	8.0	A farewell to greatness ?	In my humble opinion , " Marnie " remains Hitchcock's last major work : subsequent movies will be entertaining at best ( " torn curtain " , " family plot " ) , overblown ( " Frenzy " ) when it's not downright disastrous ( " Topaz " ) . And however , " Marnie " has not got a good reputation . François Truffaut used to call it " un grand film malade " ( = a great sick movie ) , but he used to add : " masterpieces are not always vibrant ; great sick movies always are " . It's the last movie in which the mother plays a prominent part . All Marnie's problems deal with childhood . How many Hitchcock's heroes are like her ? A whole lot : Rod Taylor in " the birds " , Perkins in " Psycho " , Walker in " stranger on a train " and even , in a minor mode Cary Grant in " north by norwest " . However , " Marnie " is not on a par with the former movies : Sean Connery , whose talent nobody can deny , seems ill-at-ease in this universe ; Grace Kelly was to play the lead , but because of problems between Monaco and the général de Gaulle , she was not allowed to do so ; so she was replaced by Tippi Hedren , an ok but limited actress . Marnie's character is much more complex than Melanie from " the birds " and Hedren is not completely convincing . Supporting actors include a fine Diane Baker and in a cameo ( a sailor ) , Bruce Dern who will star in Hitch's final movie " family plot " .
583379	1219578	74860	8.0	typical thriller of the seventies	Along with " Midnight Cowboy " ( 1969 ) , this is John Schlesinger's most important work in a rather undistinguished filmography . Although they belong to two distinct genres , these two works have some common points : the same backdrop New York , the same main actor , Dustin Hoffman , here hires for another type of character . The 1969 film had seen him in the shoes of a little miserable Italian emigrant who suffered from TB . The second film gives him the role of a student , " Babe " haunted by the suicide of his father caused by McCarthysm . His thesis about the abuses of power in American political history seems less prominent to his eyes than the marathon for which he intensely trains . A solitary life which will be interrupted by an infernal chain of foreboding mishaps . They revolve around a conspiracy involving a former Nazi criminal , Szell ( Laurence Olivier ) nicknamed the " white devil of Auschwitz " . Babe finds himself in the throes of darkness , wrestling with unforgiving , formidable evil forces whose motivations and goals are elusive to him . " Marathon Man " is a representative film about a trend which developed in the seventies : the conspiracy cinema fueled by generalized suspicion and an increasing paranoia . Just check works such as " the Parallax View " ( 1974 ) by Alan J . Pakula or " Three Days of the Condor " ( 1975 ) by Sydney Pollack . From a fragmented , meandering master plan elaborated by William Goldman , John Schlesinger captures a discomforting climate of fear and paranoia which increase throughout Babe's struggle in the darkness . The director has also the aptitude to generate eerie feelings from sequences shrouded with a muted anxiety . Helped by a brutal editing , an invisible , impending threat hangs over the film and will sooner or later catch Babe up . To puzzle more the audience , Schlesinger muddies the waters and one of his cunning tricks is to delay as much as possible the clarification and the denouement of this apparently convoluted story to make this unsettling atmosphere last . For a major part of the film , the different parts of the puzzle remain separated but to piece them together and so to decipher the story , the viewer will have to be patient just like Babe . He's caught in a spiral of unnerving events which go beyond him and his immature behavior inconveniences the audience , perhaps more than Szell and his henchmen . Before having made the acquaintance of Elsa , Babe tried to flee from reality but is finally caught up by it . To blur the picture , Schlesinger and Goldman tap numerous possibilities of the suspense genre . Illusions and lies abound in the film under different forms : the image " Doc " gives to Babe , the moment when he sneaks into Babe's cramped flat to test his reactions , Babe's false release from Szell's clutches . Schlesinger's directing is laced with effective suspenseful scenes but about the notorious torture sequence with dental surgery instruments , I have never found it really creepy and doesn't live up to its reputation . A character will hint at it in a droll sequence in " Serial Mom " ( 1994 ) by John Waters . On the other hand , the scene is somewhat intense when Olivier asks to Hoffman : " is it safe ? " . One of the best sequences of the film shows him in Madison Avenue where he is recognized by former prisoners and no one seems to care about the woman's shouts . This scene rings true . On the other hand , the film includes weaknesses to bridge the steps of the story like the moment when Babe asks his scoffing neighbors to pretend to burglarize his flat to give him his clothes and his gun . And while I'm on the possible drawbacks of the film , Schlesinger's directing doesn't exclude some easy effects . But they are of minor importance . Even if he's credible as an immature , brazen student , Dustin Hoffman was a little too old for the role . To think that the same year , he acted a clear-sighted journalist , Carl Bernstein in Alan J . Pakula's compelling " All the President's Men " . Beside him Laurence Olivier is brilliant as usual and the two secondary actors , Roy Scheider and Marthe Keller confer to their characters mysterious , opaque dimensions . This is a legion suspenseful movie of the right bottle .
584721	1219578	89072	8.0	good Charlotte . . .	François Truffaut and Jacques Doillon who have often worked with children know well one thing : making a movie about childhood or adolescence is a quite difficult thing . Here , it is Claude Miller's turn to broach the delicate topic of adolescence . The less we can say is that he signed here a sensitive and bitter work that brings out enough strength and emotion to compare with the filmmakers ' movies previously quoted . The first indisputable quality that we can put forward is the following one : Claude Miller's film is very far from the clichés generally attributed to teenagers . Charlotte isn't a nymphet , only a teenage girl who is not a happy person and who's searching for love and understanding . The director succeeds very well in making us share his heroine's profound discontentment and Charlotte Gainsbourg won a well-deserved Oscar for her remarkable performance . Apart from the relevant and convincing description of Charlotte , Miller painted a series of characters who are never on the edge of caricature . Lulu is perhaps a naive little girl and the director somewhat made her look ugly by giving her glasses but he does everything to hide her dumb air . Then , Charlotte's father is presented as a good man and faced with her daughter's insolence , he can contain his anger . One last example , Clara's manager is not obsessed with money . With Charlotte Gainsbourg , it would be unfair to neglect the rest of the cast . Either the actors are young or old , they all have a common point : they are all excellent . This only confirm one gift that Claude Miller had already shown in his first movie , the harrowing " la meilleure façon de marcher " ( 1976 ) : an excellent direction of actors . Besides , like in " la meilleure façon de marcher " ( 1976 ) , " l'effrontée " ( 1985 ) is a perfectly stable movie , both funny , touching and where Miller skilfully alternates moments of tension and calm and the rare moments of violence are only suggested like the scene when Charlotte hits Jean with his globe . Quite obviously , what mainly interested the director in this film is Charlotte's relationship with the most important character of the film : Clara Baumann . Their confrontations constitute the key-moments of the movie . Clara is a talented young pianist and Charlotte blindly idolizes her . She is ready to believe everything she says , even when Clara confides to her that she would like to become her impresario on tour . It is interesting to note down that when she talks about Clara , Claude Miller gently laughs at her naivety . More important , through their relationship , Miller compared their respective worlds . The music used ( the song " Sarà , perché ti amo and Mozart ) reveal the incompatibility of these worlds and the beginning of the sketched friendship ( but is it really friendship ? ) is eventually bound to fail . To tell this failure , Miller proceeds by little touches : the manager's telephone that doesn't answer , Lulu who creates a scandal during the show . This failure clearly shows Charlotte's disillusion but it doesn't stop the movie to end on a positive tone : when we see the heroine take care of Lulu , she seems to have understood that her place is among her family . The movie also contains another strong point : the relationship between Jean and Charlotte where Miller favors the progressive rise of tension . For this , he uses the same method as Charlotte's failure with Clara : he proceeds by little touches : the movie they watch at the cinema is " the Exorcist " ( 1973 ) and the tension gradually grows and explodes when they are in Jean's hotel room . I must admit that I don't know enough Claude Miller's work . I only saw " la meilleure façon de marcher " ( 1976 ) , " la petite voleuse " ( 1988 ) and this one " l'effrontée " ( 1985 ) but these three films were sufficient to make me a very good impression of this filmmaker and I am long to discover his other opus .
583263	1219578	372784	9.0	and ends with brilliant results	" Batman " was created by Bob Kane in 1939 and in the sixties , a wacky version with gaudy colors was shot . The Batman saga was revived by Tim Burton and it started under auspicious skies with the two following novel chapters : " Batman " ( 1989 ) and " Batman Returns " ( 1992 ) . With the arrival of Joel Schumacher , the series plumbed . " Batman Forever " ( 1995 ) and " Batman and Robin " ( 1997 ) were real downers which tarnished Batman's reputation . Due to this , Gotham City's most well-known inhabitant took refuge in his den and waited for things to evolute . In the meantime , he was upstaged by other superheroes like " Spiderman " . Was there a future for Kane's son ? Rather than pouncing on the elaboration of a new adventure ( at one point , one even talked about the possibility of a story called " Batman vs Superman " ) , why not plumping for a streak which has been seizing the Hollywood firm for several years ? Just look at the titles of the following works : " the Exorcist : the Beginning " ( 2004 " or recently " the Texas Chainsaw Massacre : the Beginning " ( 2006 ) . These titles give this inkling : to go back to the sources and roots and unearth what made Batman a myth . Like many moviegoers on this site , when I learned that Christopher Nolan was the heir of this work , I felt that the project was in good hands . I'm not a fan of his " Memento " ( 2000 ) but I recognize that he's a canonical filmmaker and this was largely conducive to Batman's rehabilitation . The storyline is apparently slick on the surface , but in depth it conceals several directions . More than half of the storytelling is based on Bruce Wayne's psychological turmoil , His trip in the world to forget the traumatizing death of his parents under his eyes . His apprenticeship and learning to gain trust and knowledge and to try to overcome his demons and to put a term to his weaknesses . As Liam Neeson puts it : " you are afraid of your own strength " . But eventually , the young man will have recourse to his own fears to fight fear ! To admire the hero , you'll have to be very patient for one can't see him before almost the half of the film . The second half which sees the young cape crusader going back to Gotham City to make justice triumph and creating some of his gadgets which cemented his popularity like the " Batmobile " is more devoted to action sequences . These thrilling moments keep a very reserved feeling to insist that Batman is a flesh and blood protagonist . It is more embellished by a restricted use of special effects . But Nolan and his scenarist didn't put aside rigor and construction . The development of the story is fantastic as one could wish with twists , turns to keep the audience interested . Apparently the scarecrow wants to command Gotham City but the biggest villain isn't necessarily the one you can think of . Even " Batman Begins " is a typical Hollywood product , it is earmarked of Nolan's touch . The filmmaker deftly introduces flashbacks at the right time and sometimes flashbacks inside flashbacks ! And Nolan once said that he liked to oppose the subjectivity of a character to the objectivity of the world . This declaration could make sense in one of the thrusts developed in the film : many inhabitants in Gotham City may think that justice is lost but Bruce Wayne / Batman is back and here to stay to convince them that it's not dead . The setting helps to capture this and Nolan's own ominous vision of the city : a Gotham City shrouded with a gritty urban realism and in which bribery and violence easily propagate due to the power of the underworld . This assumed perspective breaks out in the apocalyptic end of the film which in a certain extent harks back to George Romero's cult film " the Night of the Living Dead " ( 1968 ) with the population wandering in a hazy , artificial fog in the throes of fear and madness . Thanks to Nolan's stringent brio , these different levels in the scenario and in the directorial style are combined to amount to a meshed , well-rounded poise shot without alacrity . An overlong movie ( 2h 20 minutes ) but the length eludes the viewer . For this resurrection of Batman , Nolan gathered a stellar cast . Every actor slips into his or her role in an unselfconscious way . Christian Bale can preen himself on having got the role of his life and he has never been so much better than here . Michael Caine brings a mix of complicity and mischievousness to the butler Alfred and I have a preference for Cilian Murphy whose cynicism and deadly charm have positively devastating effects . For Nolan , the transition from a " film d'auteur " to a Hollywood blockbuster wasn't knotty at all and even if the whole seems easy , it's very bracing . So thank you Mr . Nolan for having re gilded Batman's credibility . The follow-up is currently under way . Let's hope it will showcase the same high standard of quality .
585155	1219578	105131	9.0	he said that Christine Pascal would make a beautiful film	SPOILERS A divorced man ( Richard Berry ) learns that her daughter's got an incurable illness . They're leaving on the French and Italian roads and they tend to become closer themselves as if they wanted to escape from the terrible truth . Finally they arrive on their second home in the southern France where Berry's wife ( Anémone ) is there and she knew the truth about Violette before coming here . . . . The movie is very similar to " l'arbre de Noel " , a film made by Terence Hill in 1969 but this one was very poor and flat whereas Vincent's film is beautiful and successful ( it won the Louis Delluc's price in 1993 and it deserved it ) . In spite of the dramatical situation and the presence of death in the background , her film remains very gleeful : during their travel , the two main characters are alive , thrilled and the landscapes are magnificent and sunny , besides several pictures are beautiful . Pascal succeeds in alternating the comical and the dramatical scenes , these last ones are harrowing and touching like the sequence in the theater of Milan . Moreover , she avoids tears and it was what " l'arbre de Noel " wanted to produce . There is only one weird scene : the last sequence . Of course , it's an open end : what will Richard Berry do after he saw Violette falling asleep ? I think that it was useful because if the director had filmed Violette's death , the film would have been a flop . To sum up : a light and beautiful film .
583896	1219578	33105	9.0	Two masterpieces in a year .	In 1940 , Frank Borzage gave two great movies in a row . In these trouble times , it was a true tour de force to achieve that . " Strange cargo " and " mortal storm " are admirable works , works of redemption , full of compassion for the human race . Hats off to you , M . Borzage , you who are often ignored when they list their favorite directors . A user wrote that " strange cargo " was ahead of its time . It's so obvious that even now , it remains demanding , deep , and absorbing . When you see where the adventures movie has gone , the likes of Indiana and co , you wonder that some works like that have been produced . " Strange cargo " anticipates the cinema future . In several respects it's John Huston before John Huston , but with more faith in the human nature . I would go as far as saying the first part is some kind of Bunuel's " la mort en ce jardin " ( 1956 ) , but a Christian ( ! ) Bunuel . The users who saw the Spanish director ' s underrated film will be struck by the analogies between the two works . Gable's and Crawford ' characters resemble George Marchal's and Simone Signoret's in " la mort en ce jardin " . Or rather the other way about . The main difference is the indomitable faith in God that Cambreau displays in the whole movie . His face radiates like a Christ , and Ian Hunter outshines the two stars Gable and Crawford . His performance , subdued and sober , but always mesmerizing , fascinates . There are unforgettable scenes : the beach , where he opens the gates of eden for some kind of thief ; the cask of fresh water ; his strange predictions ; Clark Gable screaming " I'm God ! " after throwing him into the water . The movie often verges on fantastic , but a spiritual and sustained fantastic , not drivel such as " IJ and the last crusade " . " Strange cargo " was followed by " mortal storm " , which iseven more superior to it . Here , Borzage anticipates on Minnelli " the four horsemen of the Apocalypse " 1961 ) and Visconti ( la caditi degli dei 1969 ) . His love for the human race is still beaming : in a world gone mad where nazi hate oozes everywhere , there will be several Cambreau to heal the wounds : Mr . and Mrs Roth , Martin , Freya and the old Mrs Breitner . Do not miss his earlier works , pacifist ones of course : " three comrades " and " no greater glory " . Should they give a Nobel price of cinema , Frank Borzage would have been a strong contender in his lifetime .
582890	1219578	33627	9.0	49th parallel	It would be absurd to dismiss " forty-ninth parallel " as a propaganda movie . At the time a whole lot of movies were like that . Names ? William Wyler's " Mrs Minniver " ( 1942 ) , Fritz Lang's " man hunt " ( 1941 ) and " hangmen also die " ( 1943 ) , Alfred Hitchcock's " foreign correspondent " ( 1940 ) and " lifeboat " ( 1943 ) , Frank Borzague's " mortal storm " ( 1940 ) , Howard Hawks's " sergeant York " ( 1941 ) in America , Michael Powell , but also Alexander Korda ( " that lady Hamilton " ( 1941 ) ) in England , no to mention Russia ( SM Eisenstein ) or France ( Marcel Lherbier's " entente cordiale " ( 1939 ) ) . To be precise , one should add that Powell's masterpiece " a matter of life and death " ( 1946 ) ( stairway to heaven ) was also a commissioned work " to sweeten the US / England relationship " . When a movie brings something to heart and mind , it transcends propaganda and can become a work of art . Leave the term to Leni Von Riefenstahl's " Triumph des Willens " . Powell's movie is absorbing , it literally grows on you : during the first fifteen minutes you say to yourself : " another war movie " but further acquaintance shows this : Michael Powell is an auteur , a pacifist , and he knows cinema can be a powerful tool because of its popularity . Barely realist , it sometimes becomes some kind of fable road movie . Violence is thoroughly absent except for the beginning and the execution . The movie is full of extraordinary scenes : Sir Laurence Olivier dying , clutching his rosary ; the German Christian community - influenced by Frank Capra's " lost horizon " ( 1937 ) but the atmosphere of which predates Peter Weir's " witness " by forty years-the long dialogue about democracy : here , Powell puts a question over the notion of " native country " no less ; this recurrent picture of kneading trough which epitomizes not only the daily bread but also the new values the children who escaped from crumbling Europe can share ; the gigantic gathering of white and red men where a mounties man asks everybody to scrutinize his neighbor's face , in order to find the enemies , a sequence to rival the best of Hitchcock ; Leslie Howard , the educated man , who loves Matisse , Picasso and Thomas Mann , whose works he proudly keeps under his teepee ; the finale at Niagara falls on the trainor how to find a pacifist solution . Besides , the movie completely avoids pathos and grandiloquence by a very mundane last line which Billy Wilder would not disown . A movie where the stars do the supporting cast job : Sir Laurence Olivier only appears a dozen of minutes ( love his " alouette , gentille alouette " tune ) ; anyway , before he shaves , you hardly know him ; and ditto Leslie Howard , but his character is so endearing you'll remember him even if it's a ten - minute part . One ceaselessly rediscovers Powell ( not forgetting his first-class scenarist Pressburger ) and it's only the beginning . Most of his works are crying to be seen . If propaganda means conveying a message of love , peace and understanding , you can call most of his movies so .
584361	1219578	210476	9.0	Nouveau riche	In spite of a very poor rating , this film is really a killer ! By far Jean Dreville's most important film as well as one of the best Charles Vanel's performances . First intended for Raimu , it seems that Vanel was finally a better choice and anyway if you give this movie a chance , he's gonna blow your mind . Lord ! What an actor ! MOnsieur Lechat is a nouveau riche : he epitomizes the American dream turned French . A self made man , he worked his way up and now he lives in luxury in a desirable mansion where his missus ( who tells her daughter that if there are poor people it's because they are lazy ) is ill-at-ease ( it's so huge , I cannot get used to it ) . He ' scompletely devoid of compassion , a heart of stone and a desire to push people out of his way , a smug smile every time he puts one of his business ' colleagues down . He feels no remorse when he learns a man committed suicide whereas he could have saved him effortlessly . " Business is business " is Octave Mirbeau's play masterfully transferred to the screen . Monsieur Lechat makes all Chabrol's bourgeois seem nice by comparison . Monsieur Lechat ' s next victim is to be the Marquis de Porcellet ( Marquis of Piglet ) . Now the bourgeois have replaced the nobles at the top , and there is no room there for the ruined aristocrats except . . . if they let their son marries the wealthy businessman's daughter . For , like Monsieur Jourdain , in Molière ' s " Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme " , Monsieur Lechat wants his daughter to be a Marquise ( and maybe a duchess ) . Unlike Jourdain , Lechat is no idiot and he kills two birds with one stone : he enters an obsolete world which retained in the first half of the twentieth century some prestige ; and he humiliates a man whose pride , honor , duty and moral values are his reasons to live . But if Mirbeau shows some sympathy for the Marquis ( and finally avenges him ) , he does believe that all those values are doomed and fast becoming things of bygone days . " Les Affaires Sont les Affaires " , released in the darkest year of the Occupation is almost a desperate work : only the tycoon's daughter , by breaking off communication with her family , may mean hope for the future . Her lover is a scientist the discoveries of whom the daddy wanted to take over . 72 minutes : evil reigns .
583655	1219578	33523	9.0	Exciting French whodunit thriller .	It's a Georges Lacombe ' s movie , but actually , it marks the birth of a giant of the French cinema : Henri-George Clouzot . Here credited " Georges Clouzot " , he wrote the dialogue , and his wicked sarcastic humor occasionally surfaces . From Belgian Stanislas-André Steeman ' s detective story " six hommes morts " ( six dead men ) , it's really a very exciting thriller . Six friends go their separate ways during five years in order to make their fortune around the world . When they go back , some have succeeded , some have failed . But one of them covets the whole pile and is doing away with his former mates . To reveal more would be a real spoiler . Suffice to say there's a very good suspense sustained till the very end . Not only Clouzot wrote the script , but he also provided the movie with a female star : his then-partner Suzy Delair . She portrays exasperating Mila Malou , detective Wens ( Fresnay ) ' s girlfriend . The movie was a commercial success , and Clouzot became a director : his first movie was the wonderful " l'assassin habite au 21 " ( a must ! a must ! ) which reunited Fresnay and Delair playing the same characters of another SA Steeman book .
583525	1219578	37976	9.0	Déjà Vu	Once upon a time there was a land where they made movies where a good story to tell , beautiful pictures and wonderful actors were the only things that counted . Some day - must be the early sixties I can't remember - a wicked fairy came and said : " Listen to my magic spellListen carefully , listen well You old lousy directorsPrick your fingersAnd sleep for a hundred years ! " That was the way many a movie from the late forties and the fifties became sleepers , still waiting for the prince who would wake them . . . . or an IMDb reviewer : " La Foire aux chimères " by Pierre Chenal , " La Fete à Henriette " by Duvivier , " la Neige Etait Sale " by Saslavsky and many more . . " Le Pays sans Etoiles " is one of these sleepers ! To think that many Gerard Philipe fans do not even know that this movie exists . Oddly , and although he plays the main character , his name does not appear at the top of the credits , because he was relatively unknown in the world of cinema whereas he was already famous on stage . Gerard Philippe is perfectly cast as the romantic young lead of a movie which is crying to be seen . The director , George Lacombe , is not considered an " auteur " in France , but he did give an excellent thriller ( " Le Dernier Des Six " which owed a lot to Clouzot's screenplay though ) and two interesting works : " Martin Roumagnac " and " Les Musiciens du Ciel " . " Le Pays Sans Etoiles " is easily Lacombe's peak ; like " Dernier Des Six " , it ' s got a brilliant screenplay by Pierre Very . Very was excellent when it came to introducing a sense of mystery in a detective story : one remembers " L'Assassinat Du Père Noel " and " Les Disparus De Saint-Agil " both classics by Christian-Jaque . " Le Pays Sans Etoiles " ( what beautiful title ! " starless land " ) features an unusually inventive screenplay , brillantly blending present and past . Here , Lacombe ' s directing is almost in the same league as the best of Jacques Tourneur when he conjures up fear and mystery in the places he depicts : the train , the " cliff " , the old mansion , the cemeteryThe hero coming to the village of Tournepique has a deja vu sensation . It seems to him he was here in ancient times , he feels something threatening over him . He meets a schoolteacher ( Jany Holt ) who , in the village , has a bad reputation cause she played around with the first to come . She hates her mother ( the always reliable Madame Sylvie ) and her mother treats her like dirt . Simon falls in love with her and discovers there's something strange about her too : doesn't she resemble the woman of a painting of the last century ? Up comes Simon's brother ( Pierre Brasseur , at his most cynical ) . This woman of long ago used to write a diary : Aurelia was some kind of Cinderella , divested of her inheritance by her wicked uncle and her vicious cousin . The two stories are told in parallel and finally becomes one in the last scenes . It's difficult to summarize such a movie , but just one word : if you are interested in the French cinema , you should watch this . Like this ? try these . . . . . . " Portrait of Jennie " ( Dieterle , 1949 ) " The French lieutenant's woman " ( Reisz , 1981 ) " Dead Again " ( Branagh , 1991 )
583370	1219578	335266	9.0	take the time to relax yourself a little with this little pearl	In 1999 Sofia Coppola made a breakthrough in the landscape of North-American cinema with " the Virgin Suicides " in which she walled up 5 lovely female teenagers in silence due to their severe parents and notably their mother . 4 years later , Francis Ford's daughter moves to Tokyo in Japan but keeps the theme of loneliness to give it to her two lost main characters as a means to assess their lives . So , Tokyo constitutes the backdrop for this bitter story . It's a city brimming with lights and people and from a Western standpoint , one often imagines the image of an uptight city . Sofia Coppola rather showcases us a laid-back , carefree vision in which the modernism of the city symbolized by a highly advanced technology and tall buildings is next to a preservation of old traditions and customs . Japan has a strong power of fascination on Western society and I've heard several times some of my peers that they would love to go there . If their dreams come true one day , it is highly likely that they will feel puzzled on the first days of their stay , just like Bob Harris ( Bill Murray ) and Charlotte ( Scarlett Johansson ) . The former is a prestigious , seasoned actor who came to Tokyo to pocket a few millions of dollars for a whiskey brand while the latter is a fresh philosophy graduate from Yale who hurriedly married a young photographer . Both are somewhat jettisoned by their native close relatives . Both wind up in a four-star hotel amid a country with a culture and a language they don't understand and both are sleepless due to jet lag and in prey to a deep inner turmoil . Nothing at first lets suggest the success of this May-to-December relation but each of them found a soul mate to provide them solace and relief . Charlotte doesn't know what to do with her life but perceives Bob as a solid rock while Bob who is at wits ' end considers Charlotte as a reminder of his youth . From the arrival of the two heroes in the chic hotel to their first moments together to their exploration of the city through the mob , colorful places and with their mutual support , Sofia Coppola reused a formula which proved its worth in her precedent work and here it shines again to give astounding results . Everything in her directing breathes delicacy , fragility and she favors a low-key cinematographic language . So it entails a sort of complicity with her two leads . A good pack of her sequences rings thoroughly true like for example when Charlotte rings her mother to tell her her first day in Tokyo . Then , the fax and the telephone are the sole means of communication with their native country for her two heroes and lets the audience suggest the state of their own relationships , especially with Bob whose private life and particularly his marriage goes unravel . Looks , gestures have a big intensity while the suggested has a meaty part in the dialogs . To make the dish more appealing , the female filmmaker had also recourse to a discreet humor like when Bob tries to follow the Japanese director's instructions through the interpreter . Sofia Coppola was right not to steer her film towards a well-worn master plan which would have seen the two characters almost at once in each other's arms . Actually , I must admit that I didn't think of this perspective during the major part of the film . It's much more novel to see two human beings finding their bearings in the throes of a whirlpool shrouding a noisy city and a seemingly indecipherable culture that they timidly tame . The evocative original soundtrack is in perfect adequacy with the images and was discerningly chosen . The lyrics of " More Than This " by Roxy Music could apply to Bob ( you have to see his performance on a karaoke ) and Charlotte . Specialists of noise such as " My Bloody Valentine " and " the Jesus and Mary Chain " are a perfect musical illustration of the urban chaos in which the two characters happily wrestle . This is also Bill Murray's most ground-breaking role since " Groundhog Day " ( 1993 ) . Like in this ingenious comedy , he acts a cynical man who eventually transmits joy and happiness to the ones he meets . Here his deadpan humor and his sense of restraint could justify the screening of the film . Beside him , Scarlett Johansson epitomizes grace and fragility . This trip to Tokyo was bracing for them and also for the viewer . This prizewinning indie remains etched on his or her memory and this is one to ponder .
585528	1219578	184483	10.0	Happiness is a misfortune you cannot see .	" La foire aux chimères " is a jewel , a sparkling diamond . It would deserve one hundred comments , and that would not be enough . Pierre Chenal was a film noir director who made moderately successful movies before the war : " l'alibi " which featured Von Stroheim too and his first version of " the postman always rings twice " , " le dernier tournant ( 1939 ) . But the 1946 work is much superior , being at once a film noir , a baroque melodrama and a fairy tale . Frank , a disfigured man ( Von Stroheim ) meets at a fair a beautiful blind long-haired blonde Jeanne ( Madeleine Sologne ) who is a knives thrower's partner ; this man , Robert , has a lover , Clara . Jeanne marries the ugly man , undergoes an operation and recovers sight . But , as says Marilou , Frank's housekeeper a proverb says " happiness is a misfortune you cannot see " . There are at least ten ( and maybe more ) memorable sequences ; each one is actually a work of art . Even if the movie is close to the realisme poetique dear to Carné , Chenal transcends it and makes a movie which verges on fantastic : when Jeanne appears for the first time at the fair ( la foire aux chimères = the dreams fair ) , she looks like a fairy , or an angel , the angel she plays in the small circus where Frank is the only spectator . The baroque house where Von Stroheim hides his beloved wife is a splendor . It's also a trompe l'oeil . The screenplay combines harshness and elegance , and works wonders : when Jeanne awakes after the operation , she pretends she cannot see because she has seen her husband's frightening face . It's only when she looks at herself in a mirror and bursts into tears that we get the picture . It might be the dark side of Cocteau's contemporary " Beauty and the Beast " . Stroheim outdoes himself and gives one of his greatest performances which compares more than favorably to that of Max Von Mayerling in " Sunset Boulevard " - who was yet to come in 1946 ! - . His character will meet the wickedness of the human race ( the flies in his mashed potatoes in the canteen , the gibes when he dances with his wife at the ball ) He will become a counterfeiter to spoil his Jeanne . But everything is illusion : " everything is illusion in this house , the paintings , the furniture , your love for me ! " he screams when he discovers his wife's secret . Chenal's camera goes crazy during the stunning last minutes : a distraught Stoheim rushes in the streets to get to his enemy's house , and it leads to a double ending ( both sad and happy ) that will haunt you long afterward . Chenal uses slopings with absolute skillOne should also mention the extraordinary use of the Pont Mirabeau où coule la Seine ( as poet Appolinaire wrote ) . " La foire aux chimères " had remained a sleeper for about forty years when it was praised to the skies during the eighties ; but too many people who like French cinema do not even know its existence . Yes , there was a cinema before the nouvelle vague .
583319	1219578	405159	10.0	long live Clint Eastwood !	Hardly one year after the shady " Mystic River " ( 2003 ) , " grandad " Clint Eastwood changes mood and perseveres with " Million Dollar Baby " ( 2004 ) , an unusual film about women's boxing which presents none sign of quieting down from the former cowboy and " dirty Harry " . He once said about his movies that they had to be before all : entertaining and compelling . Given the commercial and critical enthusiasm of his work , he well fulfilled his pledges . On the paper , " Million Dollar Baby " nearly looks like any success story , a genre that American cinema has a liking for . Maggie Fitzerald ( Hilary Swank ) is a 31 year-old woman who works as a waitress in a restaurant . Perfectly aware that her life isn't much worth , she only sees boxing to find a way in life . With the help of an old coach Frankie Dunn ( Clint Eastwood ) and after weeks of intense training , she knows a meteoric rise with fame and glory under her belt . But Clint Eastwood is a too demanding author to content himself to shot this kind of story and is ready to go beyond it to get more interested in the relationship between Maggie and his character Frankie . As a matter of fact , " Million Dollar Baby " diverts codes of the boxing world and success story to develop a touching friendship story between two opposite characters that will peak in the last wrenching third of the film . One the one hand , Maggie Fitzerald , ready to do anything to become the best woman boxing . She sees in Frankie Dunn , the perfect coach and eventually a father figure to enable her to reinforce her trust in herself . On the other hand , Frankie Dunn , an irascible old man whose life has especially been a series of disappointments and who tries to find a hope in redemption ( I think the somewhat dreary scenery of the gymnasium reflects well his temper ) . But in reality , he hides a golden heart and perceives Maggie as the daughter he hasn't had but would have liked to . To tell this absorbing story of an unlikely friendship , Eastwood uses pure film-making basics : a straight-forward narrative line , lovable characters and a calm directing without exaggerations . The whole is tinged with a huge tenderness and a humor of quality to which it is impossible to resist . And just like in " Unforgiven " ( 1992 ) , to hear a few guitar notes is better than a whole classical music orchestra . A new variation of the American dream , a praise to courage and perseverance , a just description of the boxing world , a poignant father-daughter relationship . " Million Dollar Baby " combines all these things . With this monument of emotion , Clint Eastwood is really at the peak of his art . It probably won't be his last movie but one thing is sure : by getting old , he improves and currently shots better than ever . It's simple , genuine and moving cinema at its best and no wonder it seduced the jury at the Oscars ceremony earlier this year by awarding it 4 Oscars including best actress ( Hilary Swank ) and best director ( Clint Eastwood ) .
585346	1219578	120338	10.0	my heart will go on . . .	One of the monuments of the cinema which won 11 Oscars in Hollywood in 1998 , a huge success ( well deserved ) all over the world . The revelation of two actors until then virtually unknown . This is James Cameron ' masterpiece . He chose to relate the tragedy of the Titanic that took place on the 12th of April 1912 , through the intermediary of a love story lived between a wealthy and pretty young woman ( Kate Winslet ) and a modest painter ( Léonardo Dicaprio ) . Cameron succeeds in making it fascinating in the first part of the movie . The love between " Jack " and " Rose " is so strong that can hardly believe the Titanic will bump into an iceberg and will sink . It's also together with a model bravery that the two lovers will try to escape the ship's sinking ( although historically accurate ) . Léonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet will stay among the famous mythical couples in the cinema's history . It's obvious that they are between the hands of a conscientious and carefully organized film-maker . James Cameron doesn't leave anything high and dry . He adopted a sustained rhythm not spoiled by the enormous means that he's got . It's useless to say that he masters them perfectly thanks to an important budget . Not only has this budget enabled a meticulous reconstruction of the ship but it has also enabled a reconstruction from the traditional life in 1912 with its contrasts , its oppositions . Moreover , the movie enjoys an outstanding performance from all the actors , even the minor ones and several sequences and dialogs don't lack humor . But " Titanic " is also a limited place where takes place the confrontation of two different worlds : the proletarians and the middle-class persons . This confrontation is particularly well described during the ship's sinking : the rich are by the lifeboats whereas the poor are still inside the ship and they're forbidden to go outside . The second part of the movie is remarkably well filmed and follows a logical advance based on the increase of fear and distress . Cameron emphasizes particularly on the madness that spread to the passengers but also on the officers . Little by little , these last ones are becoming mad ( one of them will kill unwittingly one of the passengers who was trying to get into a lifeboat ) . Besides , a few touches make the movie surrealist ( the four musicians keep on playing while the ship's sinking ) The other obvious qualities : a gorgeous music , some smart costumes . At the end , a movie that creates a deep emotion and where everything contributes to a perfect success .
584329	1219578	48104	10.0	Everybody's celebrating ! And Duvivier's triumphing one more time !	What can I say of " La Fête à Henriette " ? It's stating the obvious to say that Julien Duvivier was one of the most inventive directors of the French cinema . He almost never looked back , pushing his experiments forward for most of the films he made . " La Fete à Henriette " did not come out of the blue : it's the son of " Sous le Ciel de Paris " one of his most extraordinary achievements . I will try and explain the connection : the 1951 work was made of little stories , subplots - " Magnolia " was not that much an innovation for that matter - and Duvivier already displayed a compassion for his characters , he was some kind of puppet master , a God in miniature who was fascinated by the whims of fate . " La fete à Henriette " is at first a more demanding - less entertaining maybe - , more free-form , but when you've watched it , all you have got to do is stand and applaud . There are much more ideas , much more innovations than in , say , Truffaut's " day for night " ( " la Nuit Américaine " ) . Two scenarists see their last screenplay banned by the censorship . That ' s why the movie begins with ? ? ? ? and ? ? ? ? and ? ? ? ? ? in lieu of cast and credits . They've got a whole screenplay to write , and according to the mood they are in , " La Fete à Henriette " will be in turn romantic , dramatic , zany , satirical , you name it . Henri Jeanson lets his inspiration flow and his lines , his ferocious lines never lose their bite ( A VIP from the French government is about to die and the journalists around the mansion are exchanging nice lines such as : " the ideas he has ! dying on the 14th of July ! or " Hope he ' ll kick the bucket before aperitif's time ! " ) It is Henriette ' s fete , the 14th of July , French Bastille Day ! A gorgeous girl , played by the young romantic female lead of the era , Dany Robin ( most of the users saw her in Hitchcock's " Topaz " ) , has a fiancé , a photograph who has a - professional , that's what he says that is - rendezvous with a glamorous horsewoman ( Hildegarde Kneff ) . Henriette is cross and she starts to flirt with the first to come . That character whose name is subject to several changes is played by highly talented Michel Auclair . The narration is not linear , since Auclair's character is now a crazy person fresh from the asylum ( and Jeanson gives one of his best anti-militarist lines ever - Auclair to a general : " you see me and you do not stand to attention ! ) , now a b . . . . . who tries to rape the heroine , now a hoodlum with a big heart , now a wealthy family's son . . . . The whims of fate ! Duvivier himself reveals as he never did in this work : although it's meant to be a " happy " tale , his legendary pessimism resurfaces now and then . Duvivier's style is constantly superb and the camera work is dazzling . When the story ( ies ) become ( s ) too far-fetched , the scenes are filmed obliquely . The plot often stops since the two writers do not agree and they have endless discussions about what will happen next . They even quote their colleagues : one of them mentions the script ( a news item in the paper he's reading ) of " ladri di biciclette " ( " That would not make a good film ! " ) ; later they will parody Marcel Carné as they introduce for a short while a blind man who epitomizes . . . fate of course ( remember " les Portes de la Nuit " ) . Even the last scene of the fireworks verges on a spoof romantic drama . You can go as far as to write that Duvivier appropriates René Clair ' s " Quatorze Juillet " , but he effortlessly beats his predecessor at his own game . Expect the unexpected and till the last pictures ! The unexpected final twist is witty and as the cast and credits finally appear after the final " revelation " , we feel how much " Henriette " was ahead of its time , not only because it was remade by Richard Quine in the sixties ( the so-so " Paris when it sizzles ) but because many of its strokes of inspiration we found them back in such later works as Michel Drach's " Les Violonsdu Bal " ( the subject has nothing to do with " Henriette " but it imitates the form ) or Peter Weir's " Truman Show " . Did we need the Nouvelle Vague so bad when we had a great director like Duvivier ? A writer like Jeanson ? WE DIDN'T ! ! ! !
583273	1219578	56581	10.0	La Tête Contre Les Murs	After his shorts , Georges Franju made three classics : " La Tête Contre Les Murs " " Les Yeux Sans Visage " and this one . " Therèse Desqueyroux " , based on a celebrated novel by François Mauriac ( the writer wrote the screenplay of the film ) strongly recalls Franju's first masterpiece " La Tete Contre Les Murs " . Both Thérèse and François rebel against a hypocrite society whose sole concern is to keep up appearances . François is confined to a mental hospital ; Thérèse is forced to live in an isolated house , in the middle of a forest the trees of which are like bars of a cage . Franju's use of the nature , of the trees , of the leaves , of the Landais landscape is really breath-taking . Nobody can understand Thérèse but her cousin's boyfriend ( Samy Frey ) : the long conversation they have in the forest is the only moment in the whole movie when Thérèse COMMUNICATES with another human being . Her cousin , Anne ( Edith Scob , Franju's favorite actress ) is too superficial , too conformist ( even in her love affair ) and finally too preoccupied with her own interests to be someone the heroine could rely on . After the young intellectual has left , Thérèse is definitively alone . Emmanuelle Riva is one of the ten ( maybe five ) greatest French actresses of all time . As Roger Boussinot wrote : " Unfortunately for her and her carer , she ' s that kind of artist who cannot survive mediocre cinematographic ambitions " . Her best parts were , besides " Therese Desqueyroux " , " Hiroshima Mon Amour ' , " Kapo " and " Leon Morin Prêtre " and " Thomas l'Imposteur " , another Franju movie , actually his last important work . She even transcended Cayatte ' s conventional art in " Les Risques Du Métier " . Philippe Noiret , playing opposite her , portrays her husband with talent : a man so mean , so spineless , so sexless he is almost frightening . A bourgeois eunuch .
582593	1219578	30457	10.0	A salty dog	The second half of the thirties was the moment when the French cinema was at its best ! Only the Nouvelle Vague aficionados will disagree , more power to them but boy If I could , I ' d find the mathematical formula which would prove me right . Take Robert Siodmak : " Mollenard " is probably his French masterpiece , the great work he threatened to make during his French years . Along with " Pièges " ( 1939 ) . Suffice to say that these two films ( and particularly " Mollenard " ) contain the seeds of everything he would make in America in the forties , particularly his films noirs and his thrillers . But none of his American movies can be compared to " Mollenard " where the director reaches for the first time a breathtaking directing maturity . Charles Spaak , the script writer , comes up with plenty of his better lines . The dialog is sometimes so anarchistic , so risqué in the writer's vitriolic style that they say the 1937 audience was baffled by the crudeness of the language . Simply , it has something of Renoir's first bourgeois attacks such as " la chienne " - there are many similarities - . The film features two parts , and those two halves do not seem to belong to the same film ; against all odds , they do . . . ROBERT SIODMAK : A FILM NOIR GENIUS . Suffice to write he made " the killers " " cry of the city " and " criss cross " to name but three . At least 50 minutes of the film are film noir virtuosity where virtually all the scenes are unforgettable : a mythic Shanghai recreated in a studio - but as exotic as Von Sternberg's " Shanghai Gesture " - where a captain and his crew indulge in illegal practices : arms dealing . Siodmak's flair hits home at every picture : the young Chinese contact standing tied on his boat , the international concession where " no one can come back alive " from this dark part of the town , among the ruins , the fog and the machine gun waiting for the sailors ; Dalio's face in the mirror which a bullet breaks ; Dalio's death on his piano , after he confessed that anyway he was bound to lose and it was not his fault if he was an informer . The characters move like jaded human beings , almost zombies , or as if they were out of an opium den . The ship which catches fire in the night . . . The captain of a wrecked ship is always a hero . Although the company knows they were traffickers ( first for the company itself , then for themselves , a thing the boss cannot stand ) , an official fanfare is waiting for them ; actually two are here in Dunkirk harbor , for their buddies have their own band which plays " Dors Mon P'Tit Quinquin " in a gleeful cacophony while the other breaks into " le Régiment de Sambre et Meuse . In a fit of anarchistic delirium , the captain stops the stodgy speech a notable is delivering and refuses to kiss his wife ( " I'd sooner snuff it ! " ) This wife , we met her at the beginning of the movie . It's a sexually repressed bourgeois character , full of bigotry ( you'll serve tea and biscuits to the vicar ; you " ll bring the jam jar but don't you open it " ) , despise and hate for her husband . Everytime he returns is for her a calvary . The performances will blow your mind : Harry Baur was definitely the strongest actor of the era , an anarchistic macho when he was a sailor , an anti-bourgeois anti-clerical boor when he comes home and then a poor bedridden man asking for a revolver to end his life with dignity ; Albert Préjean gives fine support as the big-hearted second in command ; Gabrielle Dorziat shines in her part of a selfish socialite who smiles when she takes her dying hubby to bed ; Marcel Dalio who was often cast as a traitor is so pitiful the audience feels like forgiving him ; Robert Lynen portrays Baur's son ( he'd already done it in Duvivier's " Poil de carotte " 1932 ) , a shy boy who's afraid of his father ( and of his over possessive mum ) . Both Baur and Lynen , oddly , were killed by the Nazis . At a time when the French cinema was at his best , I say it again , " Mollenard " compares favorably with all the classics of the era " Quai des Brumes " " Pépé le Moko " " Le crime de Monsieur Lange " . It's the lost great masterpiece of the golden age . It's essential viewing for anyone interested in Robert Siodmak's sensational American career . The final pictures are superb for the captain has finally come home . The captain cried , we sailors wept Our tears were tears of joy A salty dog , the seaman's log Your witness my own hand ( Keith Reid )
582708	1219578	68361	10.0	Bunuel's towering achievement .	Bunuel's career was one of the most sensational you could dream of . At least ten of his movies are among my favorites and ten others are not far behind . Once he said : " when I was young and I was watching the sky and saying : " it's beautiful up there and there's nothing ; now , I simply say : " it's beautiful " Atheism had turned into agnosticism . Perhaps so , but Bunuel's favorite targets are still here . The bishop and the army are here to stay ; they already were in " l'âge d'or " ( 1930 ) " DIscreet charm " is a comprehensive work : it includes almost everything that made Bunuel the genius every cine buff loves ; his permanent features are all included : these bourgeois walking on an endless road are the same who were locked up in the house in " el angel exterminador " ; Rabal trying to catch one more peace of meat is like the men who were fighting for water in " el angel " . THe selfishness of the bourgeoisie is given a stunning treatment : the impossibility to get a good meal . Bunuel explodes certitudes and he explodes different genres . One of them is the light comedy with its adulteries , its mistaken identities and its contretemps . and if the message is not clear enough , one of the scenes shows the characters on a stage ! Another one is the horror and fantasy film : the young boy's mother asking him to kill his father ( who is actually not his parent ) ; and most of all the soldier's dream which could provide the substance for at least a whole movie . Dreamlike sequences are Bunuel's forte . He has sometimes been equaled ( André Delvaux : " un soir un train " ) but never surpassed : just think of Pablo's dream in " los olvidados " ; the Christ on the electric wires in " cela s'appelle l'aurore " ; Séverine's fantasies in " Belle de Jour " ; Rey's head as a bell clapper in " Tristana " . But in " discreet charm " Bunuel seems to connect all the links of the chain and his film becomes a tapestry of Bayeux where dreams and reality follow naturally . " I dreamed , Thevenot says , that Senechal dreamed that he was on a stage and . . . " It ' s " Jacob's ladder " twenty years before that later movie appears . It's also a political movie , but not a work for highbrows . What he did not fully achieved with the spotty " la fièvre monte à El Pao " , and the more interesting " death in the garden " , Bunuel pulls it off with gusto here . The republic ( sic ) of Miranda whose ambassador is none other than Rey is , even if we never see it , depicted in minute lavish detail . Unlike highbrows like Godard who deals out his lecture on Mao in " la chinoise " , Luis Bunuel remains accessible to everybody : we laugh and we laugh a lot when we discover the harsh realities of Miranda Land which has no pyramids , but has Nazis and poverty . Actually it's not that much funny . A word about the cast ; it's perfect : Rey is wonderful as a drug trafficker ambassador who is always afraid to be slain ; Stephane Audran and Jean-Pierre Cassel had teamed up two years before in another attack against bourgeoisie , Chabrol's " la rupture " ; Bulle Ogier , for once , forgets her usual parts who give the non-intellectual terrible headaches and manages to stay very natural ; Claude Piéplu and his inimitable voice ( make sure you hear his voice : nobody can dub him successfully ) portrays a colorful colonel who tells the ambassador home truth and literally invades Audran's house with his staff and has lunch with the guests ( a meal where the bourgeois , the Church and the Army eat together is something to watch ) . But for me the stand-out is feminist Delphine Seyrig , with her beaming face , her preciosity and her sweet stupidity . To say that " discreet charm " is a masterpiece is to state the obvious . Maybe Bunuel's tour de force lies in the fact that even in reality , strange things happen and the characters do not seem to be surprised and shocked . . . . as long as their privileges are not called into question . If you should only see one Bunuel film , you had to choose this one . But if you like it , treasures are waiting for you .
584877	1219578	39661	10.0	The miracle worker	It's the second time I've seen " Nightmare Alley " and I still consider it Goulding's best of all his movies I've ever seen . Tyrone Power gives perhaps his greatest performance ever . As great when he plays a handsome miracle worker as when he portrays a human wreck . The screenplay is absorbing from start to finish . The geek scenes might seem pointless at the beginning of the movie but just wait and see . . . Magic ( fake magic ) walks hand in hand with religion : the sequence when Power tells the marshal's fortune is the key to the film : the crook knows the Bible and how to use it to good effects , he read it in a reform school . The whole film is wrapped in an atmosphere of mystery : from the secret code-which fools us the audience - to the tarots Zeena reads and which often mean death , from the psychologist's recordings - which predate lots of movie by decades ( " Conversation " " Sliver " ) to this extraordinary scene in Grindle's garden ( it looks like a cathedral ! ) which is given a supernatural treatment whereas , we , the audience , do know that all is phoney ! When Stanton realizes that he reigns over people ' s minds , he does believe he is more than a magician : he is a miracle worker , a minister , not far from God himself . It's no surprising he teams up with a psychologist . Who can deny that today the shrink has replaced the priest for many people ? For that too , " nightmare alley " was years ahead of its time . The psychologist is Stanton's perfect partner : she knows his weaknesses she uses " what we call " total recall " - well before Verhoeven - " to dominate him , he who wanted to rule the world of minds . We do not really know whether the police cars arrive with their sirens wailing or if she suggests it or if it's in Stanton's mind . God preserve us from a remake of this masterful film noir !
584500	1219578	37635	10.0	Expect the unexpected !	A collective work , " dead of night " is to be ranked as one of the finest fantasy and horror movies ever done . Its screenplay is so brilliant it contains the seeds of yet-to-come movies . Two great films which recall sometimes " dead of night " , Maurice Tourneur's " La Main du diable " and Julien Duvivier's " Flesh and fantasy " look like rough drafts compared to it and however they are first-class eerie films . " Dead Night " anticipates the future of the fantasy and horror movie : its premonitory dreams , its extraordinary construction , its stories " à tiroirs " , its disturbing ending - which was imitated several times : Hubert Cornfield's " the night of the following day " among others - and above all its ominous threatening atmosphere in the cozy living-room of an English cottage . But the most extraordinary thing is the connection between the " stories " and the main plot . All the " segments " could spawn a whole movie ; they did anyway : " Christmas party " is " the others " in miniature ; " haunted mirror " would probably inspire Robert Parrish for " doppelganger / travel to the far side of the sun " ; and the " Ventriloquist's dummy " was remade , so to speak , in the late seventies as " magic " ( fans of Anthony Hopkins remember ) . This latter segment takes the viewer to a story full of madness where the writer and the director play with his reason . Michael Redgrave ' s performance is absolutely admirable , and his last sentence is really spooky . The only slight sag in the texture and the tension of " dead of night " is given by " golfing story " which is some kind of comic relief and which does not fit well in this context . After being treated to the delights of such sensational stories as " Hearse driver " " Christmas party " " Haunted mirror " and finally " ventriquolist's dummy " which leaves you on the edge of your seat , the best is yet to come ! The architect who has this feeling of " déjà vu " feels that something frightening is about to happen . The directors take the viewer to an incredible finale , which connects all the links of the chain . This film predates Luis Bunuel's dreamlike sequences in " the discreet charm of the bourgeoisie " and Adrian Lyne's " Jacob's ladder " . A work which is so ahead of its time that it does not seem to have a beginning and an end . Full circle . A fantasy and horror buff MUST SEE " dead of night " ; it's essential viewing , the grammar of the genre .
582719	1219578	60538	10.0	Harrowing , extremely beautiful .	Childhood is in the center of Comencini's work . " Incompreso " sees him going at a peak of true emotion and aesthetic refinement . Comencini is one of the greatest directors Italy has ever known even if he remains in the shadow for so many cine buffs . If you have the chance to see " incompreso " do not miss his other works " lo scopone scientifico " " Pinocchio " , the best version of the Collodi classic and his mammoth series " Cuore " , these two works dealing with childhood too , not to mention such achievements as " Casanova veneziano " ( which beat Fellini at his own game ) and " l'ingorgo " " Incompreso " is one of the saddest movies in the world and however , it's not a melodrama : it's pure emotion , realism , quivering sensitivity . A man's - a consul - wife dies and he ' s left on his own with his two children . He's a good father , but he wants his older son to become adult , to act like a man . Anthony Quayle's portrayal is not that of a tough man ; it's only little by little , in spite of his good will , that he leads his son whom he loves to despair . Some people say that you become a man when you lose one of your parents , after all ! In many a melodrama , we have heard the mother say after the father's death " now you're the man " . Comencini's work is the contrary : for him , even if a child shows more perceptiveness than the grown-ups ( see " lo scopone scientifico " or " cuore " ) , he still remains a child who should be allowed to suffer , to cry and to love . Because the father thinks that a big boy does not need tenderness anymore and he takes only the little brother in his arms . The mother is still here even if the boy does not see her anymore : there's a painting in the house , a tape which the father recorded before her death and mainly a big garden where the two brothers speak of intimate things like death . All the nannies ( are you like Mary Poppins ? asks the younger boy ) in the world that the wealthy dad can pay cannot help : that's why they stay out of the game ( and out of the games ) : never the boys will communicate with them . The first part of the film tends to show that Milo , the little kid , is the frail one ; an admirable sequence , taking place during a storm at night , shows the father taking his little boy to his room . . . but closing his door to the other . SPOILERS : Because his father does not seem to understand him , to love him , to treat him like a . . . child , the only way for him is to go where his mother is . Then begins a harrowing finale , during which the father understands ( but too late ) that his son wanted to die , even if the accident had not happened . The essay which the boy wrote " my best friend , my father " , climaxes the movie . the last picture is an extraordinary fade - in ( the mother's picture ) fade-out ( the dead boy in his bed ) . These final pictures alone would make the movie a masterpiece . Superb cinematography , remarkable cast and credits over paintings of another century , first-class score which enhances the emotions but never drowns them out . Absurd remake by Jerry Schatzberg in 1984 ( " misunderstood " ) with Gene Hackman taking on the part of the father and colossal mistakes ( flashback where the mother appears , hollywoodian happy end ) . These remakes are really a curse .
583199	1219578	39739	10.0	Chabrol's predecessor .	First of all , there is a detective story : " légitime défense " by Belgian Stanislas André Steeman whose " l'assassin habite au 21 " Clouzot had already transferred to the screen in 1942 , with Pierre Fresnay and the same actress Suzy Delair . Steeman complained about Clouzot's adaptation for both movies . The movie from 1942 was excellent , but the " detective story " side had been kept , so why complaining ? As for " Quai des orfèvres " , Clouzot was now in a new phase of his brilliant career . After having directed " le corbeau " and been blacklisted , he had a lot more to say than a simple whodunit . Steeman complained essentially about the poor detective ending , which I will not reveal of course , but Clouzot focused on the social vignettes , on his characters's psychology , and he did not give a damn about the puzzle à la Agatha Christie . By doing so , he becomes the genuine predecessor of CLaude Chabrol who has always been closer to him than to Alfred Hitchcock whom he admires much though . Suzy Delair has great screen presence , and you will love the song she really sings ( she was a singer too ) " avec son tralala " . Bernard Blier gives , as ever , a sparing of gestures and words performance , and he really pulls it off . Two characters are particularly interesting and disturbing : the first one , Dora , the photographer : she takes pictures of female models , and Clouzot , by subtle touches , reveals us she's a lesbian . Of course , the word is never uttered ( How could it be in 1947 ? ) The police chief ( fabulous Louis Jouvet ) tells her : " You and me , WE are not lucky with women . " The portrait of this cop is very detailed : we learn a lot of things about him , not necessary connected with the Delair / Blier plot : he's a widower , with a son he adores and who runs into school difficulties , particularly in geometry . So we get to know all the characters in depth . One of the most important manifesto of post-war French cinema .
583599	1219578	36342	10.0	The other side of the mirror .	Theresa Wright's character universe is cosy , harmless and safe . Her family is prepossessing . In a nutshell , her little town is some kind of paradise on earth where evil can't reach . Enter Uncle Charlie . See how Hitchcock introduces him : when the train enters the station , a black smoke signals an impending threat . ( the director will use this technique again in " the birds " : when Jessica Tandy comes back from the farm , after discovering a dead body , a black smoke is coming out of the exhaust pipe ) So , as Alice , the heroïne will discover the darker side of the mirror . Once proud of her beloved uncle , she becomes suspicious . In the most famous scene of the movie , she discovers her hero's misanthropy , who thinks the world is a big pigpen , where greedy women are staking their preys . A lot of people said ( among them François Truffaut ) that Hitchcock spoke through Charlie's voice . Some kind of self-portrait ! What puzzles and bewilders us is the way the great Master manipulates us , making us almost side with Charlie . Then horror grows ever greater when the wicked uncle tries to do away with his niece who has discovered he's a serial killer . The family's attitude is amazing : they do not seem to notice , they act as if they do not care , because Charlie is so handsome and charismatic . At the end of the movie , the dialogue almost disappear between the two leads , but the looks tell it all . I will not spoil the ending , I will content myself with saying it's ambiguous , and certainly not a happy one in the Hitchcock vein . Later , David Lynch will try to update " shadow " with his " blue velvet " : the innocence versus the wrong side of town . But Hitchcock had already achieved all that . Because , like the very few true creators of the seven art , he was not born to follow but , but to pioneer .
584923	1219578	253474	10.0	Spilzman ? What a beautiful name for a pianist . . .	In March 2003 , Roman Polanski's " the Pianist " ( 2002 ) pocketed three Oscars including best actor ( Adrien Brody ) and best director ( Roman Polanski ) . One month earlier , the ceremony of the French Oscars showered the movie with praise by attributing to it and his author similar prizes . Earlier in May 2002 , the festival of Cannes crowned it of the most prestigious prize : the deservedly Golden Palm . Already in 2002 and chiefly throughout 2003 , awards rained on Polanski's deeply moving piece of work and rightly so . It is a true return to form for him after an uneven career which started after the spooky " the Tenant " ( 1976 ) and wildly oscillated between duds ( Pirates , 1986 , Frantic , 1988 ) and palatable but not peerless works ( Death and the Maiden , 1994 , the Ninth Gate , 1999 ) . " The Pianist " helped to rekindle the flame that made such treasures , hallmarks in their own domains ( the wonderful " Rosemary's Baby " , 1968 in the fantastic or the fabulous " Chinatown " , 1974 in the film noir ) and could be a stalwart success in the movie with the Second World War as the backdrop . It is perhaps Polanski's most personal film to date and the one he has always wanted to shot , surely to exorcise traumatic memories haunting him since his childhood . Like his main protagonist , Wladyslaw Szpilman , he experienced the horror of the ghetto of Warsaw . To get his demons out of his head , he preferred to adapt for the screen Spilzman's memories , a genius pianist and a man who bit by bit lost his family and friends on whom he could rely , a man who was deprived of his piano and thus of his " raison d'être " . As Stefan Zweig says : " to read is to live " , well for him " to play is to live " . Even when he has the opportunity to play , he has to refrain himself . See the scene in which he has settled down to his flat . Before leaving him , the owner says to him : " please , don't make noise " . Polanski makes us share his craving for playing by putting his main protagonist in front of the sacred instrument ans plays us the music in Spilzman's head without the latter touches the keys . He was also a man who saw sorrow , pain and the unthinkable ( the sequences in which German officers and soldiers kill Jewish people give goose pimples because they're precisely unthinkable ) . Throughout his sufferings , chance didn't totally relinquish him : he was rescued at the last minute by a Polish policeman ( and a fellow of his brother ) who stopped him from going up in the train of death to Auschwitz . At this moment , he was saved from death but he lost his family . Then , he had to rely on his courage to survive and enjoyed the help of some fellows even if they absconded ( the woman Spilzman made the acquaintance at the beginning of the film and her husband who found him a flat ) . At last , the German officer at the end of the film , was his ultimate glimmer of hope . Roman Polanski shot his film with a classic but startling directing for the sake of detail and realism . It has a linear but inevitable progression which has the look of a downward spiral : the tightening of the restrictions on Jewish people which become increasingly harsher ( the armband to distinguish the Jewish from other peoples , then the delimitation and the encircling of the ghetto , the Jews chased away from their neighborhood and deported to the extermination camps ) and the least sign of certainty is nearly automatically blighted : " we have work certificates at last " sighs Spilzman's father . Alas ! Hopes blighted since just as he pronounces these words , a German officer asks them with other people to go outside . Some of them are killed while the others ( including Spilzman's family ) have to wait on a large square with thousands of others . Polanski also relates notable events with a minimum of means ( the fight and shooting sequences are often perceived from a balcony or a window ) . The second part of the film strongly recalls Polanski's murkiest hours extracted from his masterworks . For example , in his flat , Spilzman tries to be as quiet as possible and while searching for food in his kitchen and drops crockery . The noise makes his neighbor intervene and by giving the alarm in the building obliges him to flee once again . At this moment , we find one of Polanski's trademarks : the eerie neighbor who has a harmful influence on the hero and contributes to his or her fall ( the Castevet in " Rosemary's Baby " , the offbeat inhabitants of the building in " the Tenant " . In another extent , when Spilzman has to lurk in the destroyed ghetto ( the distant shot where we can see him trudging in the ruins of this apocalyptic landscape deserves to rank among Polanski's most notable shots in all his filmography ) , Polanski really places us amid a " in camera " in spite of the sprawling scenery . The filmmaker should also be thanked for having chosen Adrien Brody in the main role . He works wonders in a part which seemed to be tailor-made for him , a far cry from his cardboard character in M Night Shyamalan's " the Village " ( 2004 ) . He can act several persona in himself : a smart young man as well as a dirty and bearded tramp . His angular face , his acute and melancholic countenance stay with us for a long time . As for the German officers , they are often caricatured but ultimately Polanski eschews the trap of Manicheism which seemed to pervade the whole film thanks to the last sequences with the sympathetic German officer . Not all Nazis were beasts . . . Interspersed with either unbearable , either excruciating or either moving sequences and with striking shots , " the Pianist " has its place on the podium of Polanski's towering achievements . See it any costs ! Unfortunately it would seem that the flame began to flicker again given the lukewarm critics " Oliver Twist " met this year . The slump again ? Only time will tell . . .
583421	1219578	46807	10.0	If you love someone deep enough , anything is possible .	The fifties will remain Minnelli's heyday . During this decade , there are at least four masterpieces in his filmography : " lust for life " , " tea and sympathy " , " some came running " , and definitely the crème de la crème of his musicals " Brigadoon " . " Brigadoon " is perfection itself , and only " singing in the rain " can equal it , as a fifties musical : sparkling colors , dreamlike landscapes , terrific score which encompasses Irish bagpipes , peerless cast ( Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse , it's a dream come true ) , and , most of all , a wonderful script . A solid script is often lacking in musicals : that's the drawback , of , say , " An American in Paris " , which is a feast for the eye , but does not completely satisfy , because it has not got a true story . The same goes for " band wagon " . Some scenes are at least five or seven years ahead of their time : the chase in the woods , which Minnelli treats like a ballet , predates " West Side Story " . The wedding , with the torchlight procession , is impressive as well . Brigadoon story looks like a fairy tale , but it leaves a bitter taste in the mouth . The village may be the fountain of perpetual mirth , but it indicates man's failure in his pursuit of happiness . Unlike other musicals , behind its cheerful characters , the movie hides a " lost paradise " feel . The return to the modern world is impossible to the hero , ( the passage from Brigadoon to NYC skyscrapers climaxes the movie , as Charisse keeps on repeating " any day . . any night . . I love you . . . I love you " ) Reality is an impossible world for many a Minnelli character : in " lust for life " , the painter ( Van Gogh ) takes refuge in his art ; in " some came running " , the prostitute lives in a dream , thinking the writer loves him ; in " home from the hill " , the hero escapes from his wealthy milieu and becomes a worker . " Brigadoon " has few predecessors , only Henry Hathaway's " Peter Ibetson " ( 1935 ) and Frank Capra's " lost horizon " ( 1937 ) can be mentioned . Francis Ford Coppola's rather obscure " Finian's rainbow " ( 1968 ) might have tried to recapture some of the magic of " Brigadoon " , but this kind of Magic , like the village , happens every century .
584927	1219578	20814	10.0	A genesis	With " David Golder " , Duvivier the great director , the master of the darker side of the human soul was born . It contained the seeds of all that would be developed afterward . Harry-Baur gives a powerful performance of a wealthy Jewish businessman ; he is so good that the actresses seem mediocre by comparison . David Golder thinks that money can buy everything ; he does not want to help his associate who takes his own life ( " I do not care " ° ; his wife and his daughter live in luxury and would not imagine it any other way : see the daughter stroke the banknotes which her dad won for her . She displays no love , no tenderness , no human emotion at all . Later when she comes back to her desperate father , she will have the same behavior . And then David has a heart attack ! The missus is not prepared to accept poverty . While the man is lying on his bed she begins to tell him he may die soon and she has not a Franc to her name . A masterful scene where David grabs her by the throat and almost strangles her with her valuable necklace : " What about that ? " he thunders . There's a similar scene in " Chair de Poule " ( 1963 ) when Catherine Rouvel tries to worm information from a wounded bedridden Robert Hossein ; and Golder's shrew is not unlike Danielle Delorme's abominable mother in " Voici le temps des assassins " ( 1956 ) Like many Duvivier heroes , Golder , although a ruthless financier , is still a human being . When he loses the power that gives money , he thinks that his daughter's love will make up for it . Unfortunately there's no place for love in a world where rapaciousness and greed run rampant . Duvivier's blackness is absolute disembodied blackness . David will go to his grave a broken man . on his death bed , his sufferings are so intense we feel them within our body and our soul . Why such a poor rating ? Do people think that there's anti-Semitism in the film ( and in the novel ) ? There isn't : Harry Baur's wife was a Jew . Based on Irene Nemirovsky's novel ; a writer who sadly was to die in the concentration camps .
583423	1219578	18806	10.0	When my ship comes in .	Restored with a very nice score , " the crowd " hasn't aged a bit . The topic is as relevant today as it was in 1928 . Do have a look at the first pictures of " the apartment " ( 1960 ) or the last ones of " working girl " ( 1988 ) and you'll know what I mean . John Sims tries to beat the crowd , this crowd that follows him everywhere , at work , in the streets , at the fair or on the beach . He doesn't even realize his condition : you should see him laughing at the people on the street , behaving like sheep . It's always someone else , his wife says , take a look at yourself . The secondary characters are wonderfully depicted : the well-padded buddy , the mother and brothers-in-law always contemptuous , always putting John down . Lots of sequences are memorable , now comic , now tragic : the tiny flat where even the bed must be folded , the huge office where employees are doing the same job at the same time , where everybody acts alike when they leave their job , like some kind of ballet . John Sims is the embodiment of the American dream , but it has an universal appeal . When he was born , his father promised he would have good prospects , he would become someone big . King Vidor does not show the relationship father / son cause the father disappears when John is still a boy , but we can easily imagine it . So Sims thought NY was depending on him , and he discovers that he will be a wash-out all his life . If it weren't for his little boy who still believes in him ( Vittorio de Sica will remember it for his " bicycle thief " , he would throw himself under a train . The cinematography is prodigious ; two examples : The father is dead , the boy is climbing a stair : stunning high angle shot , enhancing his awful pain . On the contrary , the skyscrapers are filmed from below , showing how lost a human being can feel in this steel and glass world . A detail : the hysterical / historical joke at the fair will be used again by the Beatles themselves in their " magical mystery tour " home-made movie . 1928 : the silent era was coming to an end but we had not heard the last of it .
582409	1219578	57930	10.0	Christian-Jaque's swansong .	Christian-Jaque was a good director , who gave some of the great films of the French cinema : " les disparus de Saint-Agil " ( 1938 ) " l'assassinat du père noel " ( 1942 ) " boule de suif " ( 1945 ) and " un revenant " ( 1946 ) . From 1950 onwards , he slowly but inexorably degenerated into mediocrity ( with the exception of " Fanfan la Tulipe " and " madame du Barry " and which featured racy lines - and the cheerful ' Si Tous Les Gars Du Monde " 2and you could pronounce him dead well before the coming of the nouvelle vague . But " le Repas des fauves " ( dinner for savages ! ) is a staggering exception , and I hope that some day it will be given the rating it deserves . This is , par excellence the anti-hero movie , and Henri Jeanson , who wrote so many lines in the French cinema , is at his nastiest , abetted by an incredibly good script . During WW2 , seven bourgeois people , who celebrate the twenty-second birthday of one of them's young bubble head wife , revel thanks to the black market , while their compatriots in occupied France are starving . In the street , two German officers are killed . Kaubach , a German officer enters the dining-room and tells them they will take hostages to be shot . And , there's the rub : they will have to choose two of them . The seven cowards are stunned . They are not prepared to become heroes . WW2 does not really matter . It could take place anywhere anytime . The movie deals with human cowardice , stupidity and selfishness . And Jeanson lets his inspiration flow with such lines as : " I'd rather have a dead body on my conscience than be a dead body on someone else's conscience " or " - an enemy is a friend who lies dormant " " but a friend may also be an enemy who lies dormant " . The action takes place almost in real time and looks sometimes like filmed stage production . But the actors are first-class : Francis Blanche , who unfortunately made mediocre farces by the dozen , finds here his lifetime part , a fat mean man who befriends the Germans ; Claude Rich , almost frightening as a philosophy teacher , pretending to be THE hero , because he cannot live in the same world than him anymore ; Claude Nicot , who tries to give his young wife to the German officer ( " the intentions are good ! " ) , and suddenly the movie becomes an update of Maupassant's " Boule de Suif " which Christian - Jaque brilliantly adapted some twenty years before ; the blind man ( Dominique Paturel ) " who has got no reason to live , the poor dear , so why not him ? ; the doctor who tries to convince his pals that he cannot die because his patients do need him ; and the stupid young wife , whose IQ must rate under 60 , played by France Anglade , another clone of Brigitte Bardot ; and finally the onlt person who keeps a certain dignity , a woman whose husband is a prisoner in Germany and who tries to refuse the " game " as she urges his mates to " let the Germans choose their two victims . The plot is marvelously constructed , with a lot of black humor , and what we ' ve got to call suspense . Yes it is Christian-Jaque's great swansong and had Billy Wilder seen it , maybe he would have thought of a remake .
582433	1219578	73341	10.0	King Huston	This movie seems to have been made by a young man . It took the adventure genre to its peak ( it was to be cheapened by Spielberg in the eighties with I . Jones and co ) . The screenplay is marvelous , now funny , now dramatic , now parodic , now epic . John Huston runs the whole gamut of emotion , suspense and humor . Abetted by two peerless actors , he tells us a tale so weird that only a first-rate director could have pulled it off . A metaphor on the power , on man's conceit ( wasn't it the case for such early gems as " Sierra Madre " or late masterpieces like " the dead " ? ) , a conceit that knows no bounds . Actually , Connery's character doesn't want to be a king , he wants to be adored and worshipped as a God . ( In a famous scene , he asks Caine to bow low before him ; it's comic admittedly , but it's a dark spooky humor : in a nutshell , the " Divinity " is losing His mind ) Comedy and tragedy walk hand in hand is this subtile work . See how Connery's imposture is being found . Then we have the sublime final confrontation Connery / Caine , when the former is to be executed . It's difficult to hold back your tears ! And as for the very end of the movie , when Caine returns , it's more terrifying than the whole of " the exorcist " . " Vanity of vanities , all is vanity " Huston seems to whisper in the gloom .
584993	1219578	29192	10.0	You know old trees just grow stronger . . . .	. . . Old rivers grow wider every dayBut old people just grow lonesomeJohn Prine , " Hello in there " . My favorite MacCarey drama , better , IMHO , than his beloved works such as " Going my way " " the bells of St Mary's " " An Affair to remember " . Its influence was important in Europa , notably in France ( René Allio's " La Vieille Dame Indigne " ) or in Italy ( Luigi Comencini's " Buon Natale , Buon anno ; Vittorio de Sica's " Umberto D " ) . Unforgettable scenes : The bridge game during which the old lady gets in the way . The sound of her rocking-chair , the phone call , the children ashamed of their mum , all rings true , all leaves a bitter taste in the mouth . The letter ma sent to pa : " I cannot read anymore , you'll read the rest when your glasses are fixed " the old man's buddy says as the news become more and more depressing . One should notice here McCarey's skills ; a tearjerker maker would have shown us through the home for aged people , but the sentences of the letter are much stronger than the pictures " This is a lovely place " the daughter-in-law keeps repeating . The last afternoon together , the last hours which are all the more precious . The tenderness the director feels for his characters is infinite . Victor Moore and Beulah Bondi shine during this extraordinary romantic final : coming back to the chic hotel where they spent their honeymoon , they won't return to their selfish children's home for one last meal ( what kind of beast could enjoy such a feast ? ) . In the hotel , they dance and there's that magic moment : the conductor , realizing these old people cannot adapt themselves to the new jazzy rhythms , asks his musicians to play " let me call you sweetheart " . The ending is one of the saddest I know . Whereas Frank Capra would have probably gathered the whole family in the station , or had Thomas Mitchell arrive at the last minute when the train moves off , McCarey refuses any happy end . Hence the failure of the movie when it was released . Make way for tomorrow indeed ! There are very revealing shots of New York with the skyscrapers and the cars which run faster and faster , leaving the old by the wayside . And however these sacred lines had warned us before the tragedy began : " honor thy father and thy mother " , written on an ominous sky . Waiting for someone to say Hello in there , Hello ( J . P . )
