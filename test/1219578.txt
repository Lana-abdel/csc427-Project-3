583810	1219578	204626	1.0	Botched job	Dog food . Everything sucks in this so-called movie : a screenplay so hackneyed the average viewer must have seen the story a hundred times or more , flashy directing , poor acting from the leads , poor-as usual - female part whose only raison d'être is screaming . James Spader's wooden acting is absolutely awful . At the beginning of the movie , he's a deeply depressed man , living on acebutolol , seconal , you name it , unable to find the way back home ( that's what he says to his analyst ) and the following day , he turns into a dashing , dynamic elegant cop . As far the analyst is concerned , her only purpose is to provide the movie with an " intellectual " side . Keanu Reeves is totally unconvincing as the villain , , particularly when he " dances " . Some would be terrifying scenes look like spoofs on thrillers . Do not watch !
583815	1219578	120591	1.0	so as Def Leppard said " armageddon it ! " ( the movie )	Two movies : " the fifth element " , " armageddon " . The same subject : to save the world . The same main actor : Bruce Willis . One difference : " Armageddon " is very inferior to Luc Besson's film . Some spectacular special effects don't succeed in hiding a labored and globally conventional screenplay . Several parts of the movie are showing it . I think about the president's speech and especially Willis ' relationship with his daughter , " Grace " . At the beginning of the movie , he tends to neglect and overprotect her and this makes her weary . Then , at the end of the movie , it's true love and understanding that shine in him . On another hand , the movie falls in the following trap : Michael Bay takes his subject too seriously . Of course , the movie tries to be funny but the result doesn't work as the humor introduced in the movie is often crude and pretty low-level whereas in the " fifth element " , the humor was zany , involuntary and enabled to overlook the serious side of the action . The movie suffers from two other handicaps : it often falls into the ridiculous ( the Russian astronaut ) and almost all the actors are bad used . Bruce Willis is all the contrary of his " fifth element " ' s character . He plays the he-man , he hams it up and sometimes , he's unbearable . The other actors are barely credible in their own roles , particularly , Willis ' sinking crew . It seems that this crew is here just for having fun . One of them is taken for being very qualified but he looks like a fool . And poor Liv Tyler ! She's at the NASA just to be decorative . When the movie was released in France in August 1998 , Bruce Willis expressed is weariness of saving the world . His weariness was probably justified by this spectacular but poor movie .
583498	1219578	65515	1.0	A ( very very ) poor man's Hitchcock .	Frankly I doubt Schneider herself said that this movie " set the tone for her future roles " . If such was the case , what a poor taste she used to have . Actually , it was rather " la piscine " made the year before , that boosted her career that was on the wane after the Sissi saga ( forever my love ) . Romy Schneider teamed up again with Maurice Ronet ( who was in " la piscine " too ) , but this time with laughable results . Leonard Keigel , the director , wrote a screenplay in which the paucity of the ideas is so glaring that only a member of the audience who has never seen a Hitch , Chabrol ou Clouzot movie could enjoy this poor would - be suspense thriller . Keigel hired Chabrol's dialogue writer , Paul Guégauff : probably horrified by the emptiness of the story , he made up for it with a lot of swear-words . I wonder why talented actors like Ronet and Schneider agreed to make such a bomb ; besides , the supporting actors do not " support " at all : Keigel's wife , Simone Bach and Gabriele Tinti , sink into utterly ridiculous ham . The songs , in English ( " who are you " ) sung by a Dutch band , Wallace Collection , would nicely fit in a commercial for Martini . The critical reception was so disagreeable in France at the time ( " a film made of brics , bracs and thingummies " ) that Keigel was not to made another movie before 1977 . And it was his last one .
583754	1219578	183142	1.0	It has to be seen to be believed ( 2 )	I used the same title for " Broceliande " which took the horrror film to new heights of stupidity . This is the worst French ( and arguably Polish ? I cannot judge for that matter ) thriller that has ever been filmed to date , even beating the worst photocopies of " silence of the lambs " the likes of " les rivières pourpres " or " les morsures de l'aube " . It's a shame to take such a serious subject ( snuff movies ) and give it such a couldn't-care - less treatment . It's mindless and irresponsible to turn something unbearable into a pure entertainment movie . Alejandro Amenabar , when he made his highly superior " Tesis " did not fall into this trap ! Even " 8mm " ( with Nicholas Cage ) is a masterpiece compared to this piece of trash . The cast is abysmal ; the two cops are ridiculous : one of them is supposed to provide the movie with a comic relief but we do not even know which one ; the muscle man , who is supposed to be the hero-with-a - painful - past is perhaps worse than his so-called comic partner who treats ( sic ) whores as princesses and princesses as whores . Poland has got to find another country to team up with if they wanttheir cinema to gain a huge international audience . Why not Spain ?
582330	1219578	60561	1.0	Abysmal	" Joe Caligula " was reportedly forbidden by the censorship at the same time as Jacques Rivette's " la religieuse ' , but not for the same reasons . " Joe Caligula " anticipated Quarantino's extreme violence by more than thirty years . That does not make it a good movie for all that , by a long shot . It is actually one of the worst French duds I have ever seen . The credits go as far as claiming this : If John Ford is Homer ( why not after all ? the great director compares favorably with the Greek poet ) , then José Bénazéraf is . . . . . ( you'll never guess it ) Marcel Proust . Well , if it is so , then Ed Wood is Shakespeare . Bénazéraf is known ( but only by people who like that kind of stuff ) for his porno movies which were to follow in the wake of " Joe " : many scenes of this movie verge on porno anyway : strip tease , nude women in bed . . . Well if Howard Hawks depicted Scarface as some kind of Borgia , why not Caligula for a young crook ? The problem lies in the fact that Joe has absolutely nothing to do with the Roman emperor . Played by the late Gérard Blain , who was a commendable actor when there was a Duvivier , a Chabrol or a Wenders to direct him , but here sank without a trace . Ditto for Ginette Leclerc , who was formerly directed by Pagnol , Clouzot and Duvivier ! The rest of the cast is zombie-like , particularly the female lead Jeanne Valérie . The script is so dismal that the actors often repeat their lines twice , five times and even more ! When the starlet in tears tells the story of her lover ( or husband who cares ) who was burnt alive ( and is still burning , she points out ) , it is unintentionally highly comic . The story ? well I shall now come to the question : Bénazéraf pits Joe and his young pack against a bunch of " old " gangsters and their molls . There's no more to say . That such a turkey can be mentioned in " Guide des Films " , the Bible of the French cine buff ( and granted one star at that ! ) is beyond me .
584215	1219578	185183	1.0	Oh my God ! They ( John Travolta and Roger Christian ) killed science-fiction !	In the world of the cinema , there's one thing I don't understand and that I find mysterious : how with a pharaonic budget can we produce such appalling movies ? Roger Christian should have thought about it before he began shooting his film . He even should have given up his project . An important amount of money would have been saved . The place of " Battlefield Earth " in the top of the worst movies in IMDB is absolutely justified . This film's got every conceivable fault , every imaginable fault so that you can name it : the perfect load of rubbish : a stupid script full of flaws , rotten special effects , ludicrous actors , beginning with John Travolta . It's so overwhelmed with mediocrity that you quickly get tired of an extremely manichean plot . Nothing can be saved from a movie which is quite similar to " Planet of the apes " ( 1968 ) by Franklin Schaffner . The worst movie made in 2000 . TO AVOID !
584799	1219578	74840	1.0	Pretentious . .	Sautet had jettisoned his films noirs influences which gave the great " Classes tous Risques " and the good " L'Arme à Gauche " . One could have thought that " Max et les Ferrailleurs " his best film in the seventies would herald a return to form as well as a return to what he did best . But " Vincent François , Paul et les Autres " had continued his chronicles of bourgeois-with-a-tender-heart which " Cesar et Rosalie " had begun ( " les Choses de la Vie " is a different matter since it has an emotional power the subsequent works have not ) " Mado " is more of the same . Bourgeois " in danger of despair " to quote Sautet himself . And zombie Dutronc on top of that . The scene when the cars get bogged down in the mud is the most grotesque metaphor I ' ve ever seen in a movie . " It's the movie itself which gets bogged down " sneered the critics at the time . Romy Schneider's fans , beware ! Her appearance does not exceed five minutes ( in a 2hours + movie ) !
582354	1219578	86655	1.0	The nadir of the French psychological thriller .	Thirty years later , this movie tries to capture the atmosphere of the great Clouzot , Duvivier and Decoin film noirs of the forties and fifties . But it's wishful thinking . Because no one is HG Clouzot except HG Clouzot and do not expect the return of " diabolique " . Besides , novelist Sebastien Japrisot is one of the worst suspense writer France has ever known , and he's no match for Boileau-Narcejac , Simenon or Frédéric Dard . Such horrors like Litvak's " la dame dans l'auto avec des lunettes et un fusil " and Clement's " la course du lièvre à travers les champs " ( check the pretentious titles ! ) suffice to demonstrate this . With its " terrible past " flashbacks , its amateurish performances ( Alain Souchon , a good singer but a poor actor ) , and Isabelle Adjani who tries to make up for the paucity of ideas by showing up completely naked ( because of the heat of the Summer maybe ) , the movie can convince someone who has not seen a Hitchcock movie yet . But is there a thriller buff who hasn't ? The story is inept , complicated instead of complex . " L'été meutrier " was one of the greatest hits of the eighties French box-office , but the critics were tepid . Quite rightly so . Note : director Jean Becker is none other than Jacques Becker's ( casque d'or " " Goupi mains rouges " " le trou " and other great classics ) son . Like father , like son , definitely not .
582734	1219578	230753	2.0	After an intriguing start , it amounts to ( almost ) nothing	Do not let the Gospel reference fool you : it is not the return of Pasolini ! It has nothing to do with the Holy Writ ! Actually , this Beauvois work begins quite well , with a hunting scene , followed by a meal where the conversation is probably improvised , à la Cassavetes . Then a wedding scene which is not unlike that in Chabrol's " le boucher " . So it takes at least twenty minutes before the story really begins . Then it's downhill . As soon Baye's character is on the screen , the movie has nothing in store for the audience . The movie begins and ends with very pretentious music , that shows a tendency to make the viewer feel he's going to watch ( or has been watching ) an " important " " meaningful " " deep " work . The worst of it is , one suspects that Beauvois actually believes he's made a genuine sleeper , and does not know , has no idea at all that it's the bland and hackneyed bourgeois / blue collar love affair it actually seems to me . Mind you , Xavier , Luke , John , and Mark are up for grabs .
583819	1219578	190861	2.0	flashy , showy , no substance .	This is a movie made for His Majesty Gérard Depardieu , with an absurd supporting cast and lots and lots of wasted money . Depardieu is everywhere in the movie and reduces the others characters to walk-ons . Roland Joffé films everything he can , and tries to impress the audience with fireworks , audacious camera tricks , Fellini-inspired settings but he does not create anything . The Sun King is featured but he pales into insignificance , which is a shame all the same ! His brother is first shown as a wicked perverse man ( in the French tradition : for that matter , take a look at the " Angélique " series ) when the historians describe him as an admittedly gay man but a human being who was courageous , generous with the vanquished at war , and finally gentle ( see " Monsieur , frère du roi " by Philippe Erlanger ) . At least his last line shows his real nature but it's too little too late . But the biggest bomb is Tim Roth's Lauzun ! The duc de Lauzun was a Gascon , who was always cracking jokes , a bon vivant , fond of women , so insolent that he was finally sent to the Pignerol jail where he met again Vatel's former master , Nicolas Fouquet - the movie briefly hints at him - . Tim Roth's sullen face is by no means duc de Lauzun , this joker who would marry the king ' s cousin , la grande Mademoiselle , a spinster , for her dough : oddly this colorful dowager does not appear at all . Montespan , La Vallière do , but they do walk-on parts . ( Only one line each : Montespan : " I'm coming up " Vallière : ' I'm coming down " , the only touch of humor in the whole movie ) Queen Marie-Therèse is not well portrayed either : she was rather ugly , gauche and self-effacing . Here she seems to outshine Montespan , which is rather odd !
584409	1219578	74843	2.0	Nothing magic	After " les noces rouges " ( 1973 ) , began Chabrol's second period of barren inspiration . Although adapted from a Frederic Dard novel ( Robert Hossein's best film was a Dard novel : " Toi le Venin " ) , " Les Magiciens " is a mediocre movie , which was probably made to combine business with pleasure ( holidays in Tunisia in a luxury hotel ) . The plot : a conjurer explains to an idle dandy , Edouard , that he can predict a murder . Edouard will help make his prediction come true . The cast includes Jean Rochefort - a non chabrolesque actor - , Gert " Goldfinger " Froebe , one of the few foreign actors which Chabrol did not have to dub in French , and one of Bertolucci's favorites , Stefania Sandrelli . That does not make a film for all that .
585001	1219578	95898	3.0	Crimes in the street ( and everywhere )	a French thriller of the eighties , " Preuve d'Amour " bears all the appropriate scars of the time : it is a patchy inconsistent movie , with gaudy scenes and an unbearable music : flashy and no substance . Influenced by former works which were not that much good in the first place ( the flashbacks inspired by " l'Ete Meurtrier " , the cinematography desperately trying to ape that of " Diva " ) . If there were a time for French thrillers , it was the fifties when Clouzot , Decoin , Duvivier and even Hossein were here with their firm screenplays . The film is dedicated to Michel Auclair who died when the film was released , it's a very sad swansong for an exceptional actor who was featured in at least half a dozen of classics , notably " La Belle Et La Bête " by Cocteau , " Les Maudits " by Clement , " Manon " by Clouzot and " La Fete A Henriette " by Duvivier . He has only three or four scenes and , probably already sick , he is only the ghost of himself . The rest of the cast is undistinguished and badly directed , even earnest thespians such as Darmon and Spiesser cannot play their game well . The poor plot revolves around blackmail and murder . Because of the lack of substance , the writers call American cinema and literature for help ; we learn that both the hero and the heroine love Francis Scott Fitzgerald and his " design " apartment shows posters of " Crimes in the city " ( Don Siegel ) and " Night of the iguana " ( John Huston ) . The hero's pet is an iguana called " Hypocrit " . This reptile steals the show .
584156	1219578	289765	3.0	I can't understand the high popularity rating for " Red Dragon "	The title of my review says it all : I can't understand the high popularity rating for " Red Dragon " . When the movie was broadcast on French TV , I went on IMDb to check the mark : 7 , 4 out 10 ! This made me want to watch this film and the story reminded me of " the silence of the lambs " ' . At first sight , " Red Dragon " seems to be a promising movie : 1 mysterious serial killer nicknamed " the tooth fairy " ( Ralph Fiennes ) slaughters families every full moon . As a consequence , a FBI agent ( Edward Norton ) is required to track him down . Only one man can help him in his investigation : the doctor Hannibal Lecter ( Anthony Hopkins ) . A difficult task for Norton in the way he arrested this doctor a long time ago because he found out his terrible secret : Lecter is very fond of human flesh . . . From there , " Red Dragon " has all the elements to become a first class thriller in the tradition of " Silence of the lambs " . But here , nothing arouses the interest . Where does the disappointment comes from ? From several embarrassing points that handicap the film . First , Edward Norton who can't make forget Jodie Foster as an ambitious cop and his performance has got nothing stunning . Then , unlike Brett Ratner unlike Jonathan Demme is unable to create a constant climate of tension . As a result , you progressively lose interest in the plot . Given that the shortcomings override the assets , there's nothing left but one hope to save this thriller : Anthony Hopkins . Alas ! Dashed hope once again . If his threatening and penetrating countenance contributed to the success of " Silence Of The Lambs " , here in " Red Dragon " his firm and somewhat mocking face doesn't impress the audience . This last handicap finishes tarnishing the movie that you can consider as a pale copy of Demme's movie . A lifeless and tedious thriller . If " Silence of the Lambs keeps on haunting me a long time after I watched it , I have very little memories from " Red Dragon " . If you haven't watched it , you don't miss anything , really .

The movie was recently broadcast on the French TV and it's a big disappointment , particularly coming from a scenarist like Charles Spaak . First of all , the action takes place in a chocolate box Australia ( they tell us it happens in Australia , we would never guess ) . Gabin has killed a man , and of course he did not mean to do such as a thing . So , he ' s got to sail away to the islands in the sun ( a permanent feature in the thirties French cinema ) . Morgan , who appears only in the second half , committed a murder too . A policeman is hot on their heels . And to crown it all , there's an influenza epidemic . Enough is enough ! There are more holes in the plot than in Swiss cheese . Gabin and Morgan were to make a third movie together , and that last one was successful : " Remorques " by Jean Gremillon , a few years later .
584113	1219578	90090	4.0	Back to family life . . .	Pierre Joliver's works often mix fantastic with daily life . His most exciting work , " simple mortal " was an impressive sci-fi work without the special effects paraphernalia . Most of his other works , although ambitious , fail because of weak endings and cast ( Alan Bates is the only real actor in " force majeur " the end of which takes the easy way out anyway ) and absurd ideas ( why the Middle Ages in " le frère du guerrier " ? ) Although praised by the critic at time of release , and in spite of a really good thespian ( Pierre Arditi who recalls sometimes Serge Reggiani ) , it has not worn well . A cop ( who is also a writer whose works are ridiculed by the publishers ( " Have you ever read " Madame Bovary " ? ) and his partner ( " your book resembles " Madame Bovary " ) comes back to Paris to be confronted with a married again father - with a woman who could be his daughter - , and brother , brother-in-law and sister who ' re doing very bad things unbeknownst to him . . Strange dreams à la Luis Bunuel ( the hero's climbing a mountain while a voice over is begging him " please come down ! ) and a two sequences at the railway station which verge on fantastic ( the clowns scene is particularly disturbing ) promise something disturbing , unexpected twists . . . But the Pandora's box is empty and the story is so trite that it does not even improve on Gilles Grangier's " 125 rue Montmartre " . It would have taken a writer of another calibre altogether , someone like Patricia Highsmith who wrote a novel ( " Ripley goes underground " ) on a similar subject ( fake paintings ) which is highly superior to Jolivet's script . Is it a coincidence if we can see one of Highsmiths ' books ( " that sweet sickness " ) on Arditi's bed ? Another problems lies in Arditi's family : all the characters are cardboard only Arditi is trying . " Leon " ' s numerous fans might be pleased to see Jean Reno play a deadpan cop . The others will rather choose Jolivet's " simple mortal " .
585071	1219578	72337	4.0	Another Mocky's botched job .	Jean - Pierre Mocky has made a lot of movies ; few gained critical acclaim and few ( if any ) were commercial successes . Although an adaptation of an American novel , the movie is Frenchie to the core . It has , mainly in its first part a crude dialog , using the word " baiser " ( = f . . . ) in almost every line . This film does nothing but state the obvious : a newspaper which wants to tell the truth all the truth and nothing but the truth is a hackneyed subject ; and Mocky treats his subject like a bull in a china shop . Besides , he cannot even enhance the all-star male cast ( Londsdale , Serrault , Constantin . . . ) the production generously bestowed on him ; one should add that the female cast is rather poor ( Sylvia " Emmanuelle " Krystel is very bad but one can see her swim in the nude in her pool ) . From time to time Mocky makes a good work ( " l'albatros " is probably the most interesting ) but they are oases in the desert of a burned out career .
583757	1219578	139134	4.0	Choderlos de Laclos and our times .	When Stephen Frears made his much superior version , not only he cast two great thespians ( Glenn Close and JOhn Malkovich ) but he did not transpose the action to our times . Neither did Milos Forman for that matter . This movie repeats Roger Vadim's colossal mistake of the sixties ( " les liaisons dangereuses 1960 " ) , which cheapens the novel . What was amazing , disturbing and ahead of its time in Laclos ' s novel was that Madame de Merteuil , who lived in the eighteenth century , had the mind and the psychology of a contemporary woman . In our times , this character becomes banal , to put it mildly . You can find lots and lots of Kathryn Merteuil ( sic ) and Sebastian Valmont ( re-sic ) without calling Choderlos de Laclos to the rescue . IF you have read the book and you want to see a good adaptation , take the Frears one . If you want another adolescent movie , well . . . .
585371	1219578	85333	4.0	deadly vehicle round 2	From the eighties onwards , it became trendy to adapt one of the most prolific and popular American writers , Stephen King for the silver screen and the telly . I must say that I'm not a devotee of his work at all . Ditto for John Carpenter whose filmography didn't embellish the horror / fantasy genre except maybe at a pinch : " Halloween " ( 1978 ) . The tenet of a cursed vehicle that gives the ones who have the misfortune to stand in its way a hard time isn't novel . Steven Spielberg's debut movie , " Duel " ( 1971 ) revolved around the same thrust with the difference that it was an enormous truck instead of a car that tracked down Dennis Weaver and the film was gripping in its dramatic progression . Spielberg's making nearly evolved on the razor's edge and " Duel " is one of his finest cinematographic moments to date . And his movie kept a part of mystery : was there really a driver in the truck or not ? In Carpenter's flick , this zone of shadow is clarified : " Christine " is possessed by devilish forces and can drive ( and mend ) itself . Carpenter's film is nearly a rehash of Spielberg's film . Yes , technically the director keeps an attentive eye on his work and his efforts on the camera work , lighting , tightened scenery are palpable with some spooky special effects in the bargain : when the car turns on the radio to play some rock n'roll music of the fifties / sixties or mends itself , it gives goose pimples . But the film is handicapped by a weak scenario which doesn't carry much weight . Take a timid , hung-up teenager named Arnie who is the scapegoat of the riff-Raff of his high-school , make him fall in love with an old car which epitomizes an exit to a sultry familial household , change his behavior and then . . . Well what to expect ? Nearly nothing as soon as we make the acquaintance of the main characters of the film and their various relationships with Arnie and his car . The story is as linear , predictable as one could wish . Hence an absence of dramatic progression . But there's perhaps this ambiguous ( and positive ) side all the same : is Arnie really in love with " Christine " ? Isn't he rather manipulated by her ? And still this tepid music that Carpenter persists in writing . If you want a good dose of shivers with a deadly vehicle , why not doing justice to Spielberg's film ?
583781	1219578	89092	4.0	USFO	Unidentified Sci-Fi Object . What is it ? An update of Boorman's " duel in the Pacific " ? A remake of " Robinson Crusoe on Mars " ? But if it's so , who's Robinson ? and who's Friday ? A pean to universal fraternity ? Or most likely , in the last third , some kind of Rambo fighting alone against his own race to save an alien's offspring ? Well it could be of that but it amounts to almost nothing . It would have done a very funny parody , had Petersen focused his movie on Dennis Quaid's undeniable deadpan sense of humor . Alas , the director wants to be taken seriously . And he accumulates unlikelihoods , clichés and involuntary comic sequences . It takes hardly one day to the Drak to speak fluent English , complete with nuances . Shame on Quaid who speaks only broken dracon language ! Another flaw , one of the most frequent in sci-fi is the " humanity " of the E . T . : the eyes , the look , the swagger , even the language . Stanley Kubrik did know that danger , he who refused to show the e . t . , in his masterful 2001 . ( Like it or not , 2001 , remains the reference for grand art in sci-fi ) The baddies seem to come from the lousiest comic strip you can think of . The dialogue is ridiculous ; Drac Baby to Quaid : - I wish I could have a face like yours , Uncle . Thanks to this brightly thought out line , Uncle feels avenged . The Drac Brat's parent ( yes , it's singular , Dracs insist on that ) once said , aping ( no pun ) Zira , telling Taylor in a sci-fi classic : " You're too ugly " .
583312	1219578	88671	4.0	Philippe Leotard deserved better !	Philippe Leotard was a very talented actor who passed away recently . Since his debut ( his first important part was in the war movie " avoir vingt ans dans les Aurès " though he already was in TRuffault - who " invented " him , they say - in " domicile conjugal " ) , he remained an interesting personality , a Serge Gainsbourg who would have relinquished music for the movies . Like the great singer / composer , his premature death suggests he probably used to burn the candle at both ends . To crown it all , his brother was a politician , the minister of defense at the time at that ! ( Leotard used to say : me , I'm the minister of " défonce " ( = getting high ! ) ) Everything rests on his shoulders and the director contents himself with a story full of clichés ( an umpteenth version of Dassin's " night and the city " , if you know what I mean ) . The lighting effects favor dark blue and orange and most of the action takes place at night . A pre-AA Juliette Binoche briefly appears as a singer . Annie Girardot could have been an ideal partner for Leotard but her part is so underwritten it's a wonder we remember her . Watchable for Leotard's fans but only for them .
585209	1219578	383966	4.0	Talk , talk . Not enough Darroussin .	This little comedy begins well enough with a flat invaded by moths . Victoria Abril in the shop trying to understand the difference between flying and creeping insects is good fun . Her argument ( You cannot kill these poor things ! They are animals ! It's murder ! ) with partner Darroussin is even better : his comical expression makes him the funniest contemporary actor . But Darroussin's part is underwritten and too much time is given over to an uninteresting love story between an ugly girl and a so-called legionnaire . The attempts at true black humor are lame ( the bags the mysterious man carries : a nod to " rear window " ? ) . There's the obligatory " is he gay ? " trick and the scene in the toilets is ponderousness itself . There's also an unpleasant bourgeois side . Working in a small supermarket is a demeaning job , but do not worry , the ugly duckling is not what you think he is . The last scene is revealing .
585053	1219578	268755	5.0	All along the watchtower	Brother Mike and sister Kate have lost their father and the boy finds it hard to get over this death . Kate finds him a job on a watchtower while she's busy fishing . Alas he has to team up with an impostor , a serial killer ( Berenger ) . Tom Berenger is the only reason why you'd like to watch this umpteenth story of another Jack the Ripper . He's a very earnest thespian and he tries his best to give the audience an in-depth performance , complete with miserable childhood and paradoxical ( and a bit childish ) philosophy . His relationship with Kate is so predictable I will not mention it ; but with the boy , it's a different matter . He feels the boy's need for a substitute ( no pun intended as far Berenger is concerned ) . And it's really too bad the relationship Mike / Art is only skimmed over . The film is marred by an absurd ending , although the last words do not lack black humor . " I have changed " it reads . He has . indeed .
583748	1219578	283957	5.0	It's not Benoît Poelvoorde who is the millstone but the movie itself !	Launched in the Spring 2002 in France , " le boulet " was hugely successful ( more than 3 million of spectators in the French theaters ) . Why ? This success remains both mysterious and unexplainable because Alain Berbérian's movie's got every conceivable fault , every fault imaginable so that you can name it : the perfect load of rubbish . It consists on an uninspired and hackneyed script with threadbare topics . Dialogs that aren't very worked and a poor directing that emphasizes too much on special effects . But above all , " le boulet " is a bad movie because it borrows mostly elements or sequences from a lot of French movies . Thus , you find traces of " la cité de la peur " ( 1994 ) made by the same director , always Berbérian . But you also think about " la soif de l'or " ( 1993 ) and " la grande vadrouille " ( 1966 ) both made by Gérard Oury . Even the duo of characters with opposed disposition ( here , we deal with the frail Poelvoorde and the heartless Lanvin ) and who are however compelled to work together isn't original . Indeed , this comic device had been already used ( and brilliantly ) by Francis Veber . You only have to watch " la chèvre " ( 1981 ) or " les fugitifs " ( 1986 ) to realize it . With this poor movie that looks hollow , we deal with a very serious situation : it would appear that French comedy is declining . . .
583418	1219578	120399	5.0	" U Turn " away from this movie	With " U-Turn " , it seems that Oliver Stone ( Platoon , 1986 , JFK , 1991 , Natural Born Killers , 1994 ) wanted to prove his ability to shoot a thriller with simplicity and efficiency . I must acknowledge that I couldn't wait to discover his 1997 film because of its offbeat , eerie story . It's a real downward spiral for his main character Bobby ( Sean Penn ) who after a car breakdown has no other choice than to stay in a small isolated town amid a desert landscape . A short stay that will soon mutate into an overlong nightmare for him . Unfortunately , the result finds itself very below my expectations . The opening credits show Penn driving his car with a flood of fast close-ups showcasing details of him or the surrounding landscape . This cinematographic process sets the scene for the rest of what will follow . " U-turn " is in its major part marred by a flashy form which depletes the interest and ends up annoying the viewer . It was not exactly the required treatment to film this kind of story and to assess the absurdity , the madness it conveyed . The psychology of the characters is given a rough side and so is suspense . The scene of the murder of Nick Nolte falls into the grotesque . Without mentioning an endless , exasperating end at that with Penn and Jennifer Lopez who kill each other the former doesn't trust the latter and than it's Lopez who wants to abandon Penn and so on . . . Yes , Sean Penn is one of the greatest American thespians of these last years but here , the secondary roles steal him the show , particularly Billy Bob Thornton as a nonchalant garage mechanic . But is it sufficient to spend your time with them in front of this black comedy ?
585247	1219578	106977	5.0	on the run . . .	An adaptation of a famous TV series , " the fugitive " was a blockbuster when it was launched in 1993 . Did I enjoy it ? Yes and no . . . We deal with a spirited action movie , led without any dead times and with a well-balanced performance . I was told that Tommy Lee Jones almost stole the show from Harrison Ford . Honestly , I didn't have this impression . But " the fugitive " is also a movie without any major surprises and where you can detect a lack of inventiveness because it confines itself to the usual rules of the detective movie : a man wrongly accused of a crime he didn't commit , a will to discover the real culprit , police on his tail , a predictable progression sprinkled with stirring chases . Furthermore , the script , which is sometimes repetitive doesn't exclude unlikelinesses and the end makes the whole conventional . Nonetheless , Andrew Davis knows his job and " the fugitive " remains a spectacular and watchable movie but also too much superficial to call it a masterpiece .
583082	1219578	116555	5.0	to believe in love and happiness ( instructions leaflet )	I remember that this Claude Lelouch effort was surrounded by much hype when it reached the streets in 1996 . In general , when they are theatrically released , the director's efforts follow this media pattern and it probably reveals his narcissistic side . But " Hommes Femmes Mode D'Emploi " caused a stir due to the presence of Bernard Tapie who managed the Marseille football club . I must acknowledge that he gave a thoroughly honorable performance for his first steps in cinema and Fabrice Lucchini gives him strong support which was the least he could do for a seasoned actor like him . I could say the same thing for the rest of the cast . The input from each actor is surely the sign that Lelouch loves his actors and is ready to give them presence on the screen and to maintain it . This quality put aside , " Hommes Femmes Mode D'Emploi " is in the same league as virtually all Lelouch's efforts which preceded it . The director remains faithful to his favorite topics , notably fate and fortunes of life that link different characters . A little iffy editing , characters who enjoy philosophizing about life and time that go by in a positive way ( see the sequence between Lucchini and Tapie in the car when talk about the French philosopher and mathematician Pascal ) bestow the film with a naive , simplistic aura . Lelouch can't make the distinction between realism and fabulous . More serious , his freewheeling look at life leads him to irresponsibility . Pierre Arditi acts a doctor who declares his theory to Allessandra Martines that the brain is responsible for our aches . So , if you say to a healthy man that he is gravely ill and to a seriously ill man that he is in good health , morales should be inverted . Reality Mr . Lelouch is drastically different . A doctor has to tell the truth to his patients , no matter harsh it is . And there's still this drawback from him to include superfluous sequences and a subplot which barely bring something to the bulk of the main plot ( the sequences with the two tramps and the subplot featuring Claude Lelouch's daughter and Ticky Holgado's son who try hard to see again ) . As I've written it before , the cast makes up a bit for the unlikeliness and the dangerously naive side of the venture and Lelouch's virtuosity at camera is sometimes gripping but is it enough ? If you're a Lelouch buff , you'll certainly want to include it in your DVD collection . The others , you can look away without remorse .
585242	1219578	116445	5.0	a disappointment in Patrice Leconte's work	After a series of movies all excellent since " Tandem " ( 1987 ) , " les grands ducs " is the first real disappointment from Patrice Leconte . Critics and public slagged it off when the movie was released in the beginning of 1996 . What to say about this film ? It isn't a really bad movie . What surprises is the rapidity with which Leconte shot his movie . It gives the impression of a quickly made and somewhat botched movie . That's why it appears as disappointing . All right , Patrice Leconte adopted a lively and brisk making , full of liberty and movements and it is obvious that he gave Jean Rochefort , Philippe Noiret and Jean-Pierre Marielle a free hand . These three strapping fellows have a tremendous time in their respective roles and I am obliged to recognize that it is nearly a treat to see them going over the top . Furthermore , the comical situations are well organized even if a little predictable . In short , the mayonnaise isn't thickening because the rhythm of the movie is too fast to be really interested by the story . Leconte should have shown more rigor and too much liberty , too many gestures end up exhausting the attention . " Les grand ducs " remains a bombastic and excessive film which has its funny sequences but it isn't to be ranked among Leconte's major works .
583198	1219578	120018	5.0	The title is apt as far as the second part is concerned .	This Chabrol's movie begins well with funny characters , Michel Serrault cast as a bogus colonel , Huppert , as a bogus femme fatale , and FRançois Cluzet as a security guard working for shady guys . The scenes in the ski resort and on the plane , with a witty dialog including money , of course , gastronomy , army ( Ah ! our beautiful French Army ! an old and distinguished lady tells the " colonel " ) , and even Dead Poet Society ( watch out for the lines ) . Then , half-way through , the movie loses steam , the pace becomes too slow , the dialog ponderous . Jean-François Balmer ( a great actor though ) and his gang of baddies are not convincing , being too stereotyped compared to the three initial characters . At times , it would seem that Chabrol and his actors preferred to enjoy the sea sun and beach of the wonderful setting . Hence this disappointing second part where " rien ne va plus " ( nothing works anymore ) , and with a very trite ending at that ! Average .
582993	1219578	136912	5.0	Blistering	Marcel Blistene was an odd-job man of the French cinema . His movies dealt with Edith Piaf , comics character Bibi Fricotin , saints ( " Le Sorcier Du Ciel " a biopic of the Curé D'Ars which I saw at Sunday school and which scared me to death ) and more . . " Le Feu Dans La Peau " got a PG 18 when it was released and vetoed by the Centrale Catholique Du Cinema " that deemed it " immoral " . It did not spare the viewer the sordid details . The characters are defective people who look like Emile Zola's minus the writer's genius . A peasant meets a city girl ( Giselle Pascal ) during his military service ; he takes her to his farm where his sexually-repressed brother ( Raymond Pellegrin ) and a crude servant ( Nadine Basile ) live . The men are bestial brutes , the women sluts or false virtuous ladies . The screenplay is sometimes very weak : for instance , Pierre ( Philippe Lemaire ) appears and disappears without much purpose , which makes the viewer think that the whole thing was made haphazard . A note about the actors : Raymond Pellegrin goes to great pains to give his character substance ; by far the best actor of the cast , he is to be commended considering the limits he is working under . He was Giselle Pascal ' s husband in real life . Giselle Pascal had reportedly an affair with Gary Cooper before marrying Pellegrin . She never made a truly memorable movie , with the eventual exception of " Horizons sans Fin " ( Jean Dréville , 1952 ) which was about pilot Helene Boucher . Nadine Basile was specialized in demeaning parts ( see also " La Neige Etait Sale " ) , a nasty Arlette Thomas who also played parts today's actresses would not even think of .
582729	1219578	102869	5.0	What are these secrets ?	This is a sketches film introducing the Apfelglück doctor ( Thierry Lhermitte ) and four of his patients who are living each other a weird or embarrasing adventure . Among these patients , there is Jacques Villeret who's got to spend the night in a disturbing hotel . Philippe Bruneau , actor of a movie in which a cinema crew doesn't succeed in making a sequence . Then it's Alain Chabat's turn in the skin of a quizmaster who can't get rid of a crude candidate ( Roland Giraud ) . At last , it's Thierry Lhermitte's turn ! ! Indeed , following a fatal malaise , he's going to heaven ( where everything's fine . . . ) . Most of sketches movies are unequal and this movie isn't an exception to the rule . If the second and the last sketches are rather correct , the third one is falling into vulgarity and easiness , whereas the story of the first one is told and made in an indigent and unlikely way . Moreover , the movie often introduces some abortive situations and a bit of a mess that hardly maintain the spectator's attention ( Lhermitte who tries desperately to get rid of his wife in heaven ) . Now what to say about the Apfelglück doctor ? Well , he's a bad doctor : he has no control over his secretary , he doesn't care about what his patients say to him . But , we learn nothing about his professionals secrets . . . At the end : it's an untidy and light movie . In the register : sketches film , " Paris vu par . . . " is clearly superior .
584787	1219578	86984	5.0	the son of " Vertigo " ( 1958 )	An unemployed actor , Jake accepts the offer from a friend to put him up in a luxurious flat where with a telescope , he can admire and fantasize about a female neighbor who languorously takes her clothes off . It's the same " show " every night . But it's the start of a perverse game which will prove to be infinitely more dangerous for him and will catch him in the heart of a big conspiracy . " Body Double " is a piece of work that bears the seal of its auteur Brian De Palma . Manipulation and voyeurism are once again the two unifying threads of this effort and called upon to play with the hero's nerves and even the audience's . Unless you've never heard about him , it's blatant that De Palma went for a new ride in Hitchcock universe . " Rear Window " ( 1954 ) for the observation of the female neighbor and as the Master said : " don't start to spy your neighbors , it can get you into trouble " , " Psycho " ( 1960 ) for the sparse cinematographic writing and the somber story of doubles and especially , the shadow of " Vertigo " ( 1958 ) hangs over the whole film . The scheme of " Body Double " is practically identical to Hitchcock's masterpiece . In the 1958 film , James Stewart suffered from vertigo . Here , the hero is claustrophobic and the replacement is done . Then , De Palma's effort includes features that are common to his films : a main character suspected of a murder he didn't commit and who has to manage all alone to find the culprit and to exempt himself . An actress of X-rated films who isn't depreciated and ends up helping the hero even if at first , she thinks he's crazy . To shot his incredible adventure , De Palma has recourse to a sparse directing with taut camera work to fuel suspenseful sequences like the very long one when the hero follows Gloria . To increase the interest , the filmmaker interspersed his work with bombastic visual effects and there's the rub . These tricks besmirch the film and its story , notably the second part after Gloria's murder ( a would-be creepy sequence that turns out to be farcical ) . And one can't skip on certain disputable steps of the plot : is it sensible from De Palma to make Gloria and the hero kiss each other after the latter didn't manage to arrest the killer ? The two people don't really know each other . And in the second part , how can Jake precisely identify the woman who made her striptease in the neighboring flat ? Many women must have an identical act . Because of his hateful penchant for visual excesses and a lack of rigor in the story , the student doesn't match at all the Master . I say it : De Palma's finest efforts are the ones exempted from extreme effects like " Sisters " ( 1973 ) or " Obssession " ( 1976 ) . The latter being " Vertigo " ' s truly legitimate son .
583441	1219578	49632	5.0	The visitor	A parboiled cross between " rose tattoo " and " a streetcar named desire " , both Tennessee Williams ' plays . A hunky man ( Vallone ) comes to a farm in Italy on the Goats island ( ? ) . There are three women who live on the farm : the mother ( Madeleine Robinson , one of my favorite French actresses in one of her worst parts ) , the sister-in-law ( hot Magali Noel ) and the daughter ( a young Dany Carrel who puts her hair in braids , at least at the beginning ) . Guess what happens ? The movie is handicapped by ponderous symbolism such as the birth of the kid ( a goat's kid ! ) or the long sequence of the well , which in the end amounts to nothing . Most of the time , the dialog does not ring true , seasoned actors such as Robinson and Valone overplay . It is a boring movie .
583108	1219578	354448	5.0	ethereal	Like so many contemporary French thrillers , " cette femme-là " is no substance and all atmosphere . Josiane Balasko portrays a cop down in the dumps , desperate because of her only son's death on the 29 th of February . Every four year , when the fatal date gets closer , she begins to have awful nightmares all about suicide . A woman hung herself ( or was she helped ? ) in a wood . Balasko investigates and finds herself in the heart of a muddled confusing story . The final lines on the screen are , par excellence , the easy way out . The picture is dirty à la " Seven " and the music is lugubrious although , oddly , the old fifties hit " young love " comes back from time to time along with other American easy-listening tunes . There's the obligatory hint at S / M , the obligatory gay interest and the obligatory moving " mum's alone " story . THe screenplay is finally derivative and all we see on the screen was treated by George Simenon a long time ago . You'd better choose Nicloux's " Une affaire privée " ( 2002 ) which had at least a disturbing ending .
584237	1219578	33858	5.0	A belle and her beaus	When the film was finally released in Duvivier's native France , it did not meet critical favor . I personally find little fault with the opinions expressed . " Lydia " is a confused cold work . Duvivier's great American movies are not " Great Waltz " or " Lydia " . They were yet to come : " tales of Manhattan " and " Flesh and fantasy " are immensely superior to the aforementioned efforts . " Lydia " is supposed to be a remake of " Un Carnet de Bal " , Duvivier's indisputable masterpiece . But the two works are worlds apart . I would go as far as to write " Lydia " is to " Carnet de Bal " what " The long night " is to " Le jour se lève " . But Carné's chef d'oeuvre was remade by Anatole Litvak whereas Duvivier redid himself . Actually " Lydia " reminds me of Duvivier failed film " Untel Père Et Fils " ; it's a hodgepodge : a grumpy granny with a golden heart , a sailor , the Civil War ( ? ) , a blind pianist , the sad fate of blind children during the nineteenth century , the good lady whose life is not empty cause she creates a house for these unfortunate kids ( a permanent feature of the French cinema of the era : see also " Le Voile Bleu " - remade as " the blue veil " - and " Péchés de Jeunesse " ) . Nothing is left from the original work , the Madeleine of Proust of the French cinema : and showing Merle Oberon with her three beaus ( and the fourth is not far away ) does not make up for Marie Bell's spleen , solitude and nostalgia on the banks of the lake . One should also add that the male characters are not really interesting . Orson Welles was a great Duvivier fan and it's probably the reason why Joseph Cotten is part of the cast . Later , Welles would borrow the female star of " Au Royaume des Cieux " ( Suzanne Cloutier ) from Duvivier for his " Othello " . The best of this movie is its pictures : the ball is nicely filmed , although a bit kitsch ; the snowy landscapes are enhanced by a refined cinematography . The sound of my copy is rather lousy . The music , which is intrusive , often drowns out the actors ' voices .
582423	1219578	118972	5.0	Alan J Pakula's disappointing swan song	Alan J Pakula made a name for himself thanks to the stunning thrillers he made in the seventies such as " Klute " ( 1971 ) , " the Parallax View " ( 1974 ) , " All the President's Men " ( 1976 ) . Alas ! More than twenty years after the release of these movies and at the screening of " the devil's own " , this director seems to have lost his talent and inspiration . First , " the devil's own " features two Hollywood monsters : Brad Pitt and Harrison Ford but Pakula badly manages them . You are under the impression that he wanted to balance their respective sequences so that each of them has his own equal part on the screen . A particular moment clearly shows it . The day after Pitt's arrival in the USA , he comes into contact with the arms dealer Billy Burke to purchase missiles . Pakula alternated this moment with a sequence aiming at showing Ford in his role of bold cop . This demonstrative side is useless for the plot . On another hand , Pakula steeped his movie with sentimental romance for Pitt and Ford . Even if this latter point is only a detail , it makes the movie uninteresting by endowing it with a somewhat Hollywood character . It goes to show that counting exclusively on two famous actors to save a movie is not sufficient . It can even hinder its success . The disappointment of " the devil's own " also comes from the fact that not only is Pakula powerless to try something new but he is also unable to renew the detective movie . He exploits without any major surprise , a few themes with overrated reputation . You can also detect in it a lack of relief : the IRA subject is barely sketched out . Then , the relationships between the characters often boil down to a series of looks that speak volume , of pistol shots , of weak dialogs . Let's add that the movie accumulates the stereotyped characters , the predictable sequences . All these shortcomings reveal Pakula's lack of investment in his film . " The devil's own " is the final movie of a weary filmmaker . It is a pity to see him leaving the cinema on a disappointing movie , ( he was to die one year later in a car crash ) .
584631	1219578	288477	6.0	an honest horror movie . Starring Gabriel Byrne	The third movie produced by the production company " Dark Castle " and managed by Joel Silver and Robert Zemeckis , " Ghost Ship " ( 2002 ) marks a step forward and constitutes a neat improvement in comparison with the two previous movies , " the House on the Haunted Hill " ( 1999 ) and " 13 Ghosts " ( 2001 ) . This can be checked at the level of a meticulous making and quite outstanding special effects . It is all the more positive as with " Ghost Ship " , we deal with a B movie . Another good point : the change of scenery . It is a judicious choice to have replaced the threadbare topic of the haunted house by the haunted ship . If the screenplay doesn't avoid all the Hollywood conventions , neither all the clichés of the horror film , the director Steve Beck makes up for it by shrouding his movie an atmosphere of mystery as soon as the crew discovers the ship . He's also imposing ( slowly but surely ) a progressive rise of the tension which reaches its climax in the end . The result : we come in for a few real moments of fright and Beck , in the long run puts the spectator in his pocket . As far as the cast is concerned , there are two surprises . First : Julianna Margulies who for once decided to give up scalpels in the " ER " series and especially Gabriel Byrne . An ambitious actor who isn't reluctant to sometimes act in a horror movie which is potboiler for him like " End of Days " ( 1999 ) or " Stigmata " ( 1999 ) . It is a shame that the end isn't really satisfying and suits badly to the whole . But no matter , " Ghost Ship " remains a nice little horror movie whose main function is to make shiver . For this , it reaches its goal . One last thing , if the movies that come out of the " Dark Castle " production company keep on gaining in quality , maybe will they create a masterpiece one day . . . NB : it borrows a bit from " shining " .
583825	1219578	297284	6.0	And then there were . . . .	In wikipedia , you can read at the end of the long " And then there were none " entry : " although not a direct adaptation , " mindhunters " closely follows the storyline of the book " . It's true that some scenes bear more than a distant resemblance with Christie's classic thriller , but it is not the only one . It's closer , anyway to the play ( like all the versions but the Russian one ) than to the book . . It's mainly glaring in the last scenes where any Christie's reader will compare the three characters'situation to that of Vera , Wargrave and Lombard . That said , " Mindhunters " is not devoid of interest . You can also feel the " Saw " series influence when the " time is running out " . The crimes display some originality and the characters are a bit less cardboard than they usually are in this kind of flick . In the grand tradition of " Psycho " , the most famous actor ( Slater ) is killed in the first third . He should have studied the domino principle in his FBI school .
582575	1219578	26193	6.0	Walking on a wire	One of the first Litvak French movies , " Cette Vieille Canaille " stars Harry Baur , who was Julien Duvivier's favorite interpret at the time . He portrays an old wealthy man , in love with a woman much younger than he is . His rival is an acrobat ( Pierre Blanchar ) . Realizing his wife is only with him for the money , he urges her to go with his younger partner . The best scenes are to be found at the end , particularly those in the theater where Blanchar and his pal perform somersaults . The operation is also a goo moment , with a good use of superimposed pictures . However Litvak's following films " Coeur de Lilas " " L'Equipage " and " Mayerling " were improvements on this one which has remained watchable for Baur's performance . Like this ? try this " La Foire Aux Chimères " Pierre Chenal 1945
582768	1219578	310203	6.0	a typical Francis Veber product	In the delicious " le Dîner De Cons " ( 1998 ) by the same director Francis Veber , Pierre Brochant ( Thierry Lhermitte ) says to his doctor on a dogged tone : " I've got a damn fool of world class tonight ! . . . " . The viewer who discovers " Tais-toi ! " for the very first time could attribute as well this opinion to Quentin from Montargis ( Gérard Depardieu ) in this film . The IQ of this character is so low that the wardens in prisons and the male nurses in psychiatric hospitals can't stand him until one day , he makes the acquaintance of a taciturn inmate Ruby ( Jean Reno ) and thinks he's his friend because unlike all the ones Thomas met in his life , Ruby never tells him to shut up . The two men escape in a preposterous way and are soon tracked down by the police and the underworld . . . For many French viewers , Francis Veber is the guarantee of a quality entertaining movie . Throughout the years this respectable scenarist gained a large reputation thanks to a recognizable comic recipe : the mismatched duo of men . Two men with a very different disposition who have to be and to face together unexpected situations . This formula gave laugh-filled works like " la Chèvre " ( 1981 ) , " les Fugitifs " ( 1986 ) when it wasn't pure genius with " le Dîner De Cons " I mentioned earlier . With " Tais-Toi ! " , he remains faithful to his cinematographic writing and coming after the dismaying " le Placard " ( 2001 ) , it is a few notches above his precedent work . Of course , it never reaches the pinnacle of " le Dîner De Cons " but the Veber touch can be felt here and there . This man is a mastermind when it comes to depict the persona of his duo of men between the grouchy , ominous Ruby and his partner , the silly , simple-minded Quentin or to put verbal wit in hilarious dialogs . And it would be hard to resist taut , droll moments . If the 2003 vintage is more palatable than the 2001 one , that doesn't make a great film for all that . Apart from indisputable assets , Veber's scenario is plagued by a humdrum imagination and a lackluster directing to weave an immaculate story for our maladjusted duo of men . Most of the film consists in a chase with fights , shooting and stunts a little lazily filmed during which the director doesn't appear to be at ease in spite of the fantastic steps his tandem goes through . What also hampers the venture is its ultra-mapped direction and a patchy direction of actors . It would be hard to resist the blissful ignorant Gérard Depardieu but Jean Reno is a more debatable choice for he's unable to shade his acting even if Veber wrote him some witty lines . I would be tempted to write that this film showcases Veber's strong points and his limits . When he stays confined to the grounds of comedy , Francis Veber is in his element . But when he tries to make a foray into other cinema territories or to incorporate his comical gifts in it , laughter are too scattered even rare . Even if " Tais-toi ! " isn't to be hammered , it will be soon forgotten after the screening .
582987	1219578	79980	6.0	not the masterwork it is supposed to be	Alain Corneau is part of the fixture in French cinema and delivered highly estimable pieces of work throughout his career . Hence the diversity of the genres he explored either it is the adventure film with " Nocturne Indien " ( 1989 ) , probably his finest hour or the detective film with " Police Python 357 " ( 1976 ) or " la Menace " ( 1977 ) . Nominated for the Golden Palm in Cannes in 1979 and for several French Ocsars the following year , " Série Noire " is generally regarded as the filmmaker's peak as far as detective film is concerned . I don't share this enthusiasm at all . True , Corneau hired the services of two of the greatest Actors , France has ever had : Patrick Dewaere and Bernard Blier shine in their respective acting and one can't say who is the grimmest of the two . They evolve in dreary scenery rightly enhanced by a somber cinematography to confer the film a depressing atmosphere . Corneau shot his film on a shoestring budget and a reduced crew to better involve emotionally the audience . However , I'm not convinced at all by Dewaere's downward spiral who contemplates to steal the old lady's loot . Corneau doesn't leave enough clues likely to shed his demeanor and his motivations to do it . Then , if Corneau wished to highlight his tragical fate , he partly failed . The fact that Dewaere is trapped in a vicious circle because he is a victim of fatality leaves me deeply unimpressed . Mainly because once again Corneau doesn't make it obvious on the screen . And I found Marie Trintignant's lifeless acting more irritating than gripping . So what remains are indisputable assets such as the acting and the choice of scenery but that's all . Definitely not the Corneau to which I would return .
584586	1219578	407251	6.0	the bakers stripped bare ?	One negative comment for this little comedy of manners , it's a little unfair . I would tend to be more generous towards Franck Landron's effort which has the merit to bring to the light of day a social phenomenon rarely explored in cinema : naturist communities . I agree with the precedent viewer who deemed the end of the film underwhelming because unexplained . Alacrity seemed to be prevailing in the director's mind when he shot these ambiguous ending sequences . What do Olivier ( Alexandre Brasseur ) and Sophie ( Barbara Schulz ) really think about ? Are they ready to settle down in the camp or do they want to abscond and go back to their humdrum daily life in Paris ? While I'm on the drawbacks , it will also certainly be easy to fault on certain derivative points of the story . We learn that Olivier purchased this house because he didn't want to spend his holidays at Sophie's mother's . Could there be a stormy relationship between him and her ? Then , the values of this close-knit naturist community make the film a little outdated and falsely modern because it harks back to the hippie culture which used to laud a return to nature and the basic pleasures of life , notably free sex . But Landron's effort shouldn't be dismissed all the same . The title of the film designates the people who wear clothes in a nudist camp and so Sophie and her children are them . Her wary demeanor makes sense : in a society so much concerned with fashions in clothing and sense of decency , how many people would be ready to take their clothes off and to follow the rules and manners of a nudist community ? It is highly likely that many people including me and you would react like her . " Les Textiles " is a call for tolerance , integration about the right to live naked in an isolated community . There's nothing crass in Franck Landron's treatment of nudism and he films without complacency and a certain neutrality , Sophie's stay on the island among its naked inhabitants . Comical sequences are efficiently subdued . " Get your clothes off ! " says some inhabitants to Sophie . It is also to his credit to have reduced the danger of some traps which seemed inevitable like a latent voyeurism and he plays on evocative colors between bright ones during the day and dark ones in the evening . A special cinematography gives the film an almost documentary style . Don't be fooled by the low rating and give this social comedy a go .
584271	1219578	154175	6.0	French airmail .	Like John Ford's " airmail " and Howard Hawks ' s " Only angels have wings " , " au grand balcon " deals with the heroic pilots who struggled , suffered and often died to carry the mail . Their boss ( a deadpan and seemingly insensitive Pierre Fresnay ) wants them to consider the mail as a God . George Marchal - who was often compared with Jean Marais - portrays one of these fearless daring pilots with gusto . A versatile actor , he could play sword and sandals as well as his friend Luis Bunuel ' s much more ambitious opus ( " cela s'appelle l'aurore " " la mort en ce jardin " ) . Henry Decoin ' s directing is effective and avoids pathos whereas the numerous deaths could have turned the movie into a tear jerker . Two examples : - Marchal is lost in the snow , he wants to climb higher and higher because he knows that up there he will not be buried beneath . Thus , his body will be found and his old mom will get the insurance money . This sequence abruptly ends in a way that will surprise - and maybe disappoint - the audience . - Marchal's young protégé Didier is about to die , far from his homeland , but the pilot will have to leave the deathbed before the end . " Au grand balcon " is the name of the boarding-house where the pilots live . Halfway between document and novel , the movie achieves the feat of doing without a single love interest , which was rare at the time . That said , it's not really a true Decoin movie ; This director's forte was the film noir and he will be remembered for such works as " non coupable " or " la vérité sur Bébé Donge " . " Au grand balcon " should appeal to people who like the two movies I mention at the beginning of my comment .
585059	1219578	53290	6.0	A few lines in the Bible . . . .	. . . and presto ! a screenplay ! I do not exaggerate : there are five or six lines given over to Sheba in the Bible . She came to visit Solomon and suggested riddles to him . Then she came back singing the king's praises . These riddles allow double entente mind you . So why not a love story between Solomon and Sheba ? In 1959 , King Vidor had nothing to prove . He had made at least a dozen of classics : " the big parade " " the crowd " and " hallelujah " are Early . " " Our daily bread " and " duel in the sun " are Middle . " Fountainhead " and " Ruby Gentry " are Late . " Solomon and Sheba " belongs to the latter phase of Vidor's brilliant career . It has not to be taken seriously but it's much fun to watch it , even if it sometimes becomes ridiculous ( all the " religious pagan " scenes , Lollobrigida praying her idol or the infamous orgy that does not equal the one which the Jews enjoy when Mosis is talking with God in " the ten commandments " ) . Lollobrigida , in spite of her Italian accent , is a superb queen . George Sanders is a delightful villain . Brynner is wearing a wig , but it does not prevent him to be fair , as the obligatory " whose-baby-is-it ? " scene shows . SPOILER : Sheba's resurrection is weird . I'm not a specialist , but it seems to me that this concept is Christian . There's not such a thing in the Old testament . Never mind . If you enjoy epics , you'll enjoy " Solomon and Sheba " .
583707	1219578	133152	6.0	Escape from the Boulle planet .	Visually , this film is sometimes a splendor ; the light falls on a crepuscular world . The Apes ' town is quite scary particularly when you see it from a distance , as it stands out against an ominous sky . In the very beginning , the cast and credits are also successful , with an adequate martial music . The first third has some funny , parodic and sometimes politically incorrect lines . In the second third , the movie begins to lose steam , although the discovery in the wrecked spaceship is a rather good idea . But that's not all good news . First of all , the hero lacks charisma and the apes and their sensational make-up simply overwhelm him and drown him out . On the contrary , majestic Charlton Heston , even when he was in chains , displayed a Shakespearian grandeur in the first version . The last third consists in battles , a " second coming " and the " astonishing " ending without which . . that would not be " planet of the apes " . Actually , the new ending was borrowed from Pierre Boulle ' s novel , but not without adding a mathematically unlikelihood which will give you headaches if you begin to think too hard : the least they can do : Everything , even the proper nouns from the French writer's book have been removed , even if some characters recall some of the Boulle / Shaffner version . Shaffner had contented himself with changing the astronauts ' name ( eg : Ulysse Mérou = Taylor ) Hats off to Helena Bonham-Carter who brings warmth and emotion in a rather vapid cast : in a part close to that of Kim Hunter / Zira , she really asserts her distinctive identity . Tim Roth is effective as well , but his part is less so . David Warner and Kris Kristofferson are wasted . As a tribute to Shaffner ( ? ) both Linda Harrison ( an unidentified woman captured with Leo ) and Charlton Heston ( moaning his curse , which is , admittedly , funny ) appear unbilled . Tim Burton might be a director to remember . Although he has not made a genuine masterpiece yet , his filmography is already rich : " Sleepy hollow " , " Edward Scissorhands , the marvelous " Ed Wood " ( Martin Landau is unforgettable ) . But redoing " planet of the apes " was a hard task . Shaffner's movie followed a progression , it moved slowly , from the long introduction showing the three astronauts making their way across desolate landscapes to the stunning final shots with Heston and Harrison ' s roaming down by the sea . Remember how long it took Taylor to convince Zira he was a thinking man ! Here it seems natural to Ari almost as soon as she sees him , that Leo is no dumb idiot animal . And that's the last straw , even Tim Roth ( some kind of cross between Shaffner's Cornelius and a pulp fiction baddie ) pretty damn quickly believes too that that human is too clever for his own sake . Tim Burton's so-so remake epitomizes the dearth of good scripts . Pierre Boulle's book is a golden mine and one could have written a coherent story out of it , different from that of the first version . Why not , for instance , introduce the two " astronauts " whose scenes open and close it , and turn Leo's adventures into a flashback ? What about showing the love between the hero and the woman-animal ? And the son they had ? And the menace this son represented for the simian race ? All these ideas were left over by Shaffner's script writers and could have built a strong new tale . The main flaw lies in the human beings : here , they speak - English ! - , they can reason , they can swim ( ! ) , they are ( except for bubble head Warren ) clever , so why the hell did the apes tame them ?
584075	1219578	67525	6.0	The omega man will not be legend .	I saw the movie when it was theatrically released and I enjoyed it very much . Since , I read Matheson's novel , I saw the first version " last man on earth " and , when I saw it again recently , I was not as much thrilled as I had been then . On the plus side , Heston is a solid actor whose talent is obvious , the desert landscapes are impressive , and the scene when Rosalind Cash becomes a mutant gives the jitters even today . But the script writers have given a totally false rendering of Matheson's sensational conclusion : man has become THE enemy , now the new society is the vampires ' one ( it deals with vampires , not mutants in the book ) and man will become a legend ( hence the title of Matheson's novel ) , a superstition , a tale the parents will tell their naughty children when the lights are on ( or I hope so ) . Here Neville is not only the omega man , he's also the alpha man . And the final shots show him in the Christ position , a Christ without whom the others could not have survived . But these others are the human race carrying on and en route to the brand new world it's never too late to build . Plus ça change . . Also handicapped by frequent use of the hippie ideology . Heston watching " Woodstock " in a desert theater ( Coming into Los Angeles , sings Arlo ) , because he needs company - and " Woodstock " is par excellence the " crowd " movie-cannot match the intimate pictures which the hero of " last man on earth " enjoys . Both " Woodstock " and the " normal " human neo hippy community date the movie , whereas the black and white version is timeless . It's very interesting , provided you've read the novel , to see the Vincent Price version and the Charlton Heston one in a row .
583700	1219578	218657	6.0	The soft side of May 1968 .	This little movie owes a lot to his main stars , Marina Vlady and Frederic de Pasquale . This is the simple story of a laborer working overtime to give his wife a comfortable life , but who does not understand she's frustrated . While snatches of turmoil are heard on the radio , their couple runs into difficulties when she falls in love with a teacher . He epitomizes culture , a world she hardly knew ( there is a very odd scene , at the beginning , showing the eleven-year old son and his mother , watching some kind of opera " the Persians " ; another unusual scene : on the building site , the laborers discover some kind of Venus de Milo and some of them act with it as if it were a woman in the flesh ) Simone Signoret's daughter Catherine Allégret plays the occasional prostitute who appears briefly at the end . A very nice score by Georges Moustaki .
582964	1219578	273148	7.0	Adrien got his gun . . . . and became John Merrick .	Based upon a true story which reportedly happened to the novelist's ancestor , " la chambre des officiers " is a strong manifesto against war . The first third of the movie ( before Adrien leaves his bed ) strongly recalls Dalton Trumbo's masterpiece " Johnny got his gun " but with a weaker direction . The voice over , the nurse and the visit of the secretary , not to mention the " dream " about the deer , everything reminds me of " Johnny . . . " ( 1971 ) . But the movie hits its stride afterward , and , despite of overlong sequences , grabs the audience till the end when two wonderful sequences ( the one with the little girl in the metro ( = subway ) , then the last sequence with the woman who repeats " you're no monster " ) preserve the viewer from despair . Whereas war movies have often displayed maimed soldiers , they have rarely ( if they have ) shown disfigured fighters . In the hospital , we catch glimpses of the outside world only from the windows ; " From a distance , one of the unfortunate victims says , we all look the same " . And when the war's over , the 11th of November 1918 , the hero is the only one who does not rejoice . Because His war is not over : it has only begun . And these last sequences , as I said above , are the most poignant of the entire movie . " La chambre des officiers " was first a best-seller ; it was written by an engineer who had never published anything before .
583629	1219578	37024	7.0	The picture of Dorian Slade	Although a remake of a Hitchcock's celebrated silent movie , the 1944 version compares favorably with it . The conclusion is different from Hitchcock's who had " the wrong man " concept in mind . Laird Cregar gives a tormented performance , which often reminds me of Peter Lorre's " M " . John Brahm uses him with an absolute skill , working like a painter with shadow and light . Merle Oberon was never as beautiful as here . Snatches of " Beauty and the Beast " and " Phantom of the opera " occasionally surface . Oberon plays an actress who performs on stage French cancan and sings a little saucy song half in English half in French ( " Un Petit Je Ne Sais Quoi " " C'est Chic " ) And the Ripper kills the actresses , not the prostitutes as he usually does in the other versions .
582358	1219578	83925	7.0	20 years after .	" Les fantômes du chapelier " , very well received at the time of release , still stands as Chabrol's best movie in the eighties , though certain aspects of its premise have undergone some reassessment . Seen today , the movie displays flaws that were hardly noticeable 20 years ago . First of all , Michel Serrault overplays : his over-the - top performance , once lauded , seems now exasperating and throws the movie off balance . ( I wonder what Chabrol's other favorite , Michel Bouquet , would have done in this part ) . This imbalance is increased by the fact that Charles Aznavour's character is not present enough on the screen . Aznavour gives a wonderful portrayal of an Armenian émigré , whom bourgeois Serrault enjoys humiliating and demeaning . With hindsight Aznavour beats Serrault hands down . The problem with " les fantômes du chapelier " is that it recalls other superior movies : bourgeois impunity had always been treated by Chabrol himself during his 1967-1973 heyday ( notably : " la femme infidèle " , " la rupture " " juste avant la nuit " " docteur Popaul " ) , but also long before him : Henri Decoin's " non coupable " ( 1946 ) and " la verite sur Bebe Donge " ( 1952 ) : in the 1946 film , the intention is much clearier and scarier than in Chabrol's 1982 effort , and , anyway , Serrault is no match for Michel Simon . We can also mention George Lautner's " le septième juré " . " Les fantômes du chapelier " has an eerie side , verging on fantastic , but , again , there's the rub : let's face it , it looks like some kind of " psycho " of which the secret would have been be revealed sooner . Something intriguing : the camera often shows a " Ben Hur " poster in the neighborhood . A tribute to William Wyler is dubious from a " nouvelle vague " family director , but who knows ? See it anyways . Its several incredible moments will make it worth your while . For Charles Aznavour and for Chabrol's always absorbing depiction of a small town .
583087	1219578	116367	7.0	the unlikely marriage of " Pulp Fiction " ( 1994 ) and " Evil Dead " ( 1981 )	Sourced from a story Quentin Tarantino penned in his youth and dusted off in the wake of the " Pulp Fiction " impact , this Robert Rodriguez effort achieves this incredible hybrid . I must say I am uneven about the two authors of these credentials . For Tarantino , I thoroughly enjoyed " Kill Bill : Volume I and II " ( ) and at a pinch " Reservoir Dogs " ( 1992 ) but " Pulp Fiction " isn't in my straitjacket of the most memorable movies made in the nineties . As for Sam Raimi , the " Evil Dead " saga hasn't got a prominent place in my favorite horror movies but " a Simple Plan " ( 1998 ) and the adventures of Peter Parker / Spider-Man gave me a positive side from him . I could have the same judgment about Rodriguez himself : I saw " the Faculty " ( 1999 ) when it was theatrically released and I forgot all about it . Ditto for " Sin City " ( 2005 ) which was visually a black splendor but I don't remember much about the story . On the positive side , " From Dusk Till Dawn " entertained me until the last shot . It's cut in two distinct parts . The first one has more the look of a road-movie imbued with thriller with stunts , shootings , corpses galore and a dash of suspense . It's the part I favor the most . The second half of the film changes territory and takes a leap into the gore movie sourced from the eighties with blood , special effects to satisfy the genre . There is also a little of George A . Romero's masterwork " the Night of the Living Dead " ( 1968 ) and I do think this part is weaker than the first . The action becomes a bit sluggish and special effects are sometimes too intrusive . But perhaps , it was an inescapable rule to this kind of story . The amount is a film rooted in two different cinematographic genres and if it's a little hard to swallow , it means to jump on a genre while jettisoning the other , Rodriguez's effort has positive things in its contents to have a good time . Sequences are shot with care and shrewdness like the very first one . Like in " Reservoir Dogs " , we won't properly see the bloody break-in but just verbal facts from the characters and the TV . It is also permitted to hail Tarantino for his sharp dialogs . My favorite lines are when George Clooney and Tarantino take Harvey Keitel and his son hostage and Juliette Lewis arrives in the room from the swimming pool : - What's , um , going on ? - We're having a bikini contest and you just won . Later in the van on the road that leads to Mexico : - Where are you taking us ? - Mexico - What's in Mexico ? - Mexicans . Black humor shouldn't be neglected like the sequence when the journalist says the increasing number of killed people after the hold-up . And the actors seem to have fun as much as we do , notably Clooney and Tarantino in psychopathic killers who shoot first and ask themselves questions then . This B movie won't cater for all tastes for evident reasons but as it is painstakingly made as a whole , the alliance Rodriguez / Tarantino paid off well and it's a film to which I would return with pleasure .
585411	1219578	52436	7.0	The ball chase .	At my time of writing , " échec au porteur " has a very low rating . It's too bad : people who ' ll give it a chance will not be disappointed . Gilles Grangier's fifties movies are almost all worthwhile . Okay the gangsters side - with Gert " Goldfinger " Froebe - as the leader is conventional . But all that remains is original : first of all , Serge Reggiani , the star , disappears very early in the story . Then the hero becomes a ball ( you read well ) which contains a bomb which will explode around 10PM . A child takes it , then he is sent to hospital ( and he wants to keep his ball with him ) . Captain Paul " Diabolique " Meurisse has got to find back the thing . A lot of characters are involved including Jeanne Moreau as Régianni's love . Recalls sometimes that Hitchcock short " Bang ! You're dead ! " where Bill ( ) y Mumy played with a true revolver . The last sequence , when the ball almost becomes a living thing , is worthy of a film noir master .
583097	1219578	202460	7.0	Sophie's choice	Given the very poor users ' rating and given the fact that only a 70 min copy is available , it's doubtful people might want to see Jacqueline Audry's take on a child's book which is a classic in France ( in Russia I was told the young students who learn French frequently read the Comtesse de Segur's book , for this writer was born a Russian ) . The credits read " inspired by Segur's novel " so don't expect a faithful academic adaptation . Actually only the first twenty-five minutes come directly from the original story . The book was not that easy to transfer to the screen for it's not a linear story . Jacqueline Audry , instead of treating the chapters one after another-as Jean-Claude Brialy did in his late seventies listless adaptation - , blended several episodes : the doll , the tea , the donkey , etc . She added one character , Mademoiselle ( Marguerite Moreno ) , who epitomizes authority , punishment and submission . Madame de Rean , a not very kind character in the novel , became a sweet mother , under Mademoiselle's thumb . Jacqueline Audry , and it's the first thing to bear in mind , was the only female French director of the fifties . It was long before Agnes Varda . Only Ida Lupino dared to do what she did , and like Lupino , her main subject was woman and early feminism . It makes her work all the more precious to us now . I loved Segur's novels but they were reactionary to the core . Hence the second part which happens when Sophie has become an adult . It is probably the reason why people hate this movie . Cousin Paul , the virtuous boy , has turned into a revolutionary man , on the 1848 barricades . Sophie's mother being dead , Mademoiselle wants her to marry a notable's son . Audry's Sophie wants to venture off the beaten track . As the child , she was already a rebel . Unlike Segur's character she will not quiet down when she grows up . Audry laughs at the perfect little girls and their ridiculous song . The last picture is a transparent metaphor of woman's lib well before it's become trendy as well as a spoof on the Prince Charming myth .
584341	1219578	284573	7.0	Girod's best since " le trio infernal " .	Francis Girod began his career with a scandalous movie : Romy Schneider , who was looked upon as a Madonna by most of the FRench audience became one the most disgusting criminals an actress had ever played . Since he watered down his wine and subsequent works were much more moderate ( " Lacenaire " " la banquière " ) when they were not drastic failures ( " descente aux enfers " " passage à l'acte " . " Mauvais genres " is a return to form for Girod . He has never been so nefarious since his debut . Two actors give stunning performances : Robinson Stevenin plays a transvestite , a part so difficult - he is on the screen from the beginning to the end - it's a miracle he could pull it off so brilliantly . But Richard Bohringer's cop is even more impressive : his character speaks in a croaking voice , close to a whisper . Meava the transsexual is probably the most humane character in the whole movie . The plot is so complex it will demand several viewings . A lot of elements interfere : a serial killer who kills male and female prostitutes , a transvestite whose father has just been arrested for pedophilia - which might or might not lead his son ( Stevenin ) whom he abused to lead such a life - ; the " sens interdit " ( one-way street ) gay club where you can see a drag act , the " twin duet " featured in Demy ' s " les demoiselles de Rochefort " ; elements of melodrama : the past of the characters recalls those endless novels from the nineteenth century when the characters did not know exactly who their father was ; and a love the hero feels for a so-called straight mover ( who's also a gigolo ) . But more than the story , it's the atmosphere which matters . Girod creates a destabilizing world which leaves the viewer panting for breath . And it's not sexist . The monsters are not necessarily the non-straights .
582527	1219578	53050	7.0	Resistance and whodunit .	Resistance fighter Marie-Octobre ( it's her former code name ) gathers her mates after the war . There's a traitor among them and they've got to discover him and do away with him . The audience is induced to suspect one by one all the " guests " , à la Agatha Christie . The film forgets the historical background very quick to focus on an efficient but rather artificial suspense . The good cast ( Danielle Darrieux , Serge reggiani , Bernard Blier , Paul Meurisse ) makes up for the conventional side of this story . It ' s a watchable work , but it's not representative of Julien Duvivier's greatness : he was in the last part of his brilliant career and time had begun to take its toll . But his touch is still here though .
583118	1219578	107275	7.0	sweet euphemism . . .	A widowed man , Mr Charme ( Michel Bouquet ) doesn't recover from his wife's death and he asks a nurse , Reine ( Gwennola Bothorel ) to find a solution so that he can join his late wife . Reine accepts because Mr Charme is a well-off widowed and she hopes to appropriate his fortune . For this , she is helped by Mr Charme's involved nephew , " Joyeux " . The starting point of this movie is very interesting because it aims at showing the stinginess and the hypocrisy of certain characters obstinate by appropriating a person ' inheritance . As a rule , such a topic would have demanded a caustic and malicious humor but unfortunately , it's not really the case . The movie rather distills a slight and discreet humor . The ironical side of the movie is especially softened rather than showed . Nevertheless , Roger Guillot offers us a pleasant movie that is worth seeing for Michel Bouquet ' imposing performance . It just goes to show that a great actor can save a quite minor movie . When Bouquet is out of the sequences , the movie loses its interest . He also epitomizes a caricature of retired people : sullen and a tiny bit cynical .
584958	1219578	80661	7.0	prime form , trite contents	In France , it's considered polite from French critics to genuflect to the apparently cohesive chain of films Brian De Palma left behind him . However , a good proportion of his films are marred by bombastic effects " Carrie " ( 1976 ) , " the Fury " ( 1978 ) " Scarface " ( 1983 ) without mentioning his borrowings from Hitchcock . Here , in " Dressed to Kill " , it's impossible not to think of " Vertigo " ( 1958 ) for the long sequence in the museum while the key moment in the lift makes inevitably think of the shower anthology sequence in " Psycho " ( 1960 ) . About our involved film , I don't want to revive the old debate : does De Palma rip off Hitchcock ? Instead , i would tend to be generous and to classify " Dressed to Kill " in the category of De Palma's winners alongside " Sisters " ( 1973 ) and " Obssession " ( 1976 ) . With however some reservations and they're the ones I previously enumerated which fuel the bickering between De Palma's rabid fans and his detractors . If there's one sure thing in " Dressed to Kill " which can generate general agreement among film-lovers , it's De Palma's virtuosity in directing . He wields his camera just like a filmmaker expert is supposed to do . His sophisticated camera work brilliantly fuels the suspense which entails a rise of the tension and a discomforting aura . The audience is easily glued in front of the screen . This is helped by the use of several long silent sequences during which everything depends on looks and gestures . By the way , in " Psycho " , there were also long silent , suspenseful parts . . . But the main drawback in De Palma's 1980 vintage is that the quality of the plot can't be found wanting and appears to be a rehash of many formulaic , corny ingredients pertaining to an incalculable number of murder stories . The prostitute is the sole witness of the crime . Then , she's suspected by the police and has to act on her own ( with a little help from the victim's son from the scene in the subway onwards ) ) to track down the murderer and to prove her innocence . Apart from the fact that De Palma uses a type of character who for once isn't demeaned at all , it's a menu which smells the reheated . And the filmmaker ends his film on a sequence that echoes to the opening one . Yes , it's superbly filmed but when one discovers its real function , one figures : " it's almost gratuitous filler " . Perhaps De Palma wanted to stretch his film beyond one hour and a half when at this time the viewer knows ( and even before ) who the killer is . The two central mainsprings in De Palma's set of themes articulate hinges on manipulation and voyeurism . The latter theme is well present in " Dressed to Kill " from the first scene onwards which makes the film almost look like a soft porn movie . And the filmmaker isn't afraid to film his main actress and wife Nancy Allen in her underwear . I find his approach about this theme rather doubtful . But maybe the first sequence was conceived to be a mirror of the viewer and De Palma wanted to stir his peeping tom side . I don't want to demean at all De Palma's work . His prestigious work in directing which entails a communicative treat to film redeems the global weakness of the story and its doubtful aspects . Twenty six years after , the controversy he aroused amid movie-goers isn't ready to subside .
584299	1219578	41378	7.0	The granddaddy of " 10 Rillington Place " and " The Boston Strangler "	The two movies I mention in my title were proofs positive that , all that Fleischer threatened to do in the film noir field all the promises were fulfilled . " Follow me quietly " can be looked upon as a blueprint for these masterful works . Its only flaw is its length : it's obviously too short , and we would like to know more about the Judge . This serial killer apparently " punishes " : like in Agatha Christie's famous " And then there were none " ( 1939 ) , a subject which was also that of the celebrated " Seven " . All the scenes which feature the dummy are extraordinary , and Fleischer shows his brilliance when it comes to make us feel he is " alive " . Outside these three works , do not miss early efforts such as " the clay pigeon " ( with a shoestring budget too ) " the narrow margin " or later works such as " blind terror " and " Solyent green " ( a sci fi classic with film noir accents ) ; only Fleischer's final movies were mediocre , the likes of " Amytiville " " Conan " and " Ashanti " which perhaps went against him and tarnished his image . Which was unfair .
582702	1219578	27951	7.0	Mayerling revised and updated by the seventh art .	In my reviews of the 1968 Terence Young version , I've already told my thoughts on the historical facts . There's no need to get back on it : suffice to say the true story was not as romantic as sensitive people still thinks so today . Anatole Litvak does not pass over in silence Rudolph's dissoluteness , as two orgy scenes testify . Besides , Charles Boyer is a much better archduke than Omar Shariff . Ditto Danielle Darrieux who was about 20 ( whereas Catherine Deneuve was nearing 25 when she played Mary ) , thus a more credible baroness Vetsera . Both versions , it's important to notice , are both from Claude Anet's NOVEL . It's not a historian's work and it should be not looked upon so . However , Litvak is a better director than Terence Young . With a much smaller budget , and of course without the 1968 technical aids , he works wonders : the tiny church where Rudolph meets Mary in half-light creates a mystical and heathen atmosphere at once . The night at the opera house is dazzling . To conclude the scene of the ball at the German embassy , the artist uses a stunning tracking out which leaves the swirling twirling dancers , then stops on a glass door adorned with the Habsburg emblem . Rudolphe , firing at his reflection in a mirror is an adequate metaphor . A minor flaw : Gabrielle Dorziat is completely miscast as Sissi , Rudolph's mother : she was one of the most beautiful women of her time ( we can see the magnificent Winterhalter portraits at the beginning of the movie ) . At fifty , when the Mayerling tragedy occurred , her beauty was still incomparable . She had nothing to do with the aging dowager we see on the screen ( in Young ' s version , it's Ava Gardner ! ) And hats off to Danielle Darrieux who , sixty-four years after " Mayerling " , recently triumphed in " 8 femmes " , a blockbuster in France . Any advance ?
582497	1219578	71737	7.0	the polar opposite of " Excalibur " ( 1981 )	In Robert Bresson's short filmography , " Lancelot Du Lac " is probably his most dismissed piece of work for evident reasons . The author of such pearls like " Journal d'Un Curé De Campagne " ( 1951 ) and " au Hasard Balthazar " ( 1966 ) chose to adapt his minimal , inimitable style to the fabled tale of the Knights of the Round Table with Lancelot's adulterous love for the Queen Guenièvre . Was it an appropriated choice for a topic whose treatment inevitably required greatness , heroism , violence pertaining to a chivalrous tale ? Well , viewers who aren't familiar with Bresson's genuine cinematographic approach won't approve of it with a basically epic story and the filmmaker seemed aware of it given his cinema is everything but spectacular . But the auteur pushed his ideas to the extreme . So , we have here an austere view of a story usually full of greatness with very little action . The film opens and ends after a fight with bodies falling down , horses running and a desolate battle ground in the heart of a deep green forest . In the middle of the film , the audience will be allowed to watch a tournament which Bresson will reduce to its simplest elements with flags waving , Gauvain and Arthur's looks , shots on some of the horsemen's characteristics like their horses ' legs or their armors . Once again as in many Bresson's works , ellipses are given priority . When the two adversaries collide , one can't properly see the action but just the before and after . Between these rare , fragmented action sequences , the rest is devoted to an aging Lancelot and his relationships with Queen Guenièvre , King Arthur , Gauvain and the other knights . Proud characters have given way to weary ones . The Quest for the Holy Grail was lost and Lancelot attributes this defeat to the guilty love he has for Guenièvre . And he is torn between this serious mistake and the chivalrous demeanor he should adopt for Arthur . Gauvain is stuck in a similar situation between his respect for Lancelot and Arthur with whom he wants to remain faithful . Like in other Bresson works , redemption has a sizable role . Towards the end of the film , Lancelot wants to redeem himself by fighting with Arthur against Mordred . Animals also seem to play a small but vital role . A magpie is often on the branch of a tree facing the Queen's bedroom . It's no wonder this dry overhaul of the Knights of the Round Table baffled many viewers , especially the ones who have never heard of Bresson . Lines full of bitterness , regret or suspicion are recited by models with a monotonous voice and a stone-cold acting lead a film mostly deprived of action and violence . That's why I would only recommend it to Bresson's die-hard aficionados and not for newcomers who will be better served with John Boorman's " Excalibur " ( 1981 ) .
585492	1219578	75082	7.0	the wrong man	Like his elder brothers , Claude Sautet and Jean-Pierre Melville , Alain Corneau began to cut his teeth in French cinema with a series of fine thrillers : " la Menace " ( 1977 ) and " Série Noire " ( 1979 ) among others . " Police Python 357 " is a good example of how Corneau conceived and shot his works at this time of his career . They had a splendid cinematography , painstaking screenplays and a sophisticated directing elaborated for efficiency's sake . The police superintendent Ferrot ( Yves Montand ) is a cop with unconventional methods who usually works all alone . He makes the acquaintance of a young woman Sylvia Léopardi ( Stefania Sandrelli ) and becomes her lover while ignoring that she has another lover : his superior Ganay ( François Périer ) . When the latter learns it , he kills her in a fit of anger . Ferrot has to investigate the murder and all the clues are inexorably against him . . . One could deem that this kind of far-fetched story isn't exempt from glitches and sometimes , one can see right through it but Corneau's pedantic directorial style helps to conjure up a stifling , dusky atmosphere . The first part of the film before the night of the murder might seem uninteresting and however , it is crucial for what will follow this key-moment . Corneau falls back on a sober treatment with rather sparse moments and short appearances by secondary , minor characters whom the viewer will see again during the investigation . In spite of drawbacks , Corneau and his scenarist Daniel Boulanger penned a deft story . Ménard ( Mathieu Carrière ) who sometimes expresses his surprise because Ferrot keeps a relatively low profile during the investigation . But his superior knows that he usually works alone . Actually , Ferrot has to find solid tricks to muddy the waters and so to exonerate himself . Eventually , the chief idea of the film concerns Ferrot himself . He's a cop who bit by bit loses his identity and finds himself in the heart of a terrible depersonalization . It is epitomized by the moment when he throws himself acid on his face so that witnesses won't recognize him when he is brought face to face with them . The backdrop of this thriller , Orléans is efficiently enhanced by Corneau's camera and helps to inspire this eerie thriller its pernicious charm .
583941	1219578	40257	7.0	The great sinner	This Robert Siodmak may seem derivative as another film noir . But he does not follow the rules . First the two leads are cast against type . We would expect Mature as Rome and Richard Conte as Candella . It increases the interest because we do not know how their characters will evolve . Then , and it was extremely unusual at the time , there is no female central character ; gorgeous Debra Paget appears in the first sequences ( " she must be an angel " ) and only returns at the end of the movie in the church . No central female character , but plenty of them , and all are interesting : a nurse and her mom , a street gal ( Shelley Winters ) , a mannish ( lesbian ? ) female crook-the scene in the subway is very suspenseful - , and finally Rome's mom . A true mom , who still believes in her children , but who begins to lose her illusions ; fortunately there is a younger son , and the cop keeps a close watch on him . This mother is very different from the terrifying over possessive one Siodmak had introduced in his overlooked " Christmas holiday " ( 1944 )
585123	1219578	316654	8.0	I didn't see the first Spider-Man but I really enjoyed the second !	Possible spoilers . . . As I wrote in the title , I didn't watch the first Spider-Man when it was released in 2002 . But a friend invited me to go and see " Spider-Man 2 " at the movies and I honestly don't regret it at all . I was surprised to discover that Sam Raimi made this sequel ( as well as the first Spider-Man movie ) . I found out later that he is a big fan of the comic strip ; so he seemed to be cut out to shot the adventures of Peter Parker alias Spider-Man . It's better this way because this blockbuster has got plenty of qualities that worth the detour . The movie owes its success partly thanks to the nearly constant humor that are in the dialogs and also in the character acted by JK Simmons . For him , it is the opportunity to offer a delightful performance . Spider-Man 2 also enjoys quite stunning special effects which are never intrusive and used only when necessary , mainly in action or bravery sequences . But these sequences don't seem to be the most important ones in Raimi's eyes . We can't say that " Spider-Man 2 " is a pure action movie from the beginning to the end . Indeed , the director rather put the accent on the psychology of his main character , Peter Parker . He doesn't introduce him as a perfect super hero but as a clumsy young man torn between his private life that he can't manage to assume and his doubts about being Spider-Man . In short , Raimi goes against the clichés generally attributed to super heroes and offers a more complex and ambiguous view of a super hero . He also had intuition by choosing Tobey Maguire for the first role because he's truly talented and perfect . Moreover , he's got a nice personality which makes him likable straightaway . There's also an excellent choice for Kirsten Dunst whose beauty and face light the film up . With " A simple plan " ( 1998 ) , Sam Raimi had achieved a tour de force in the thriller . Here , in another extent , " Spider-Man 2 " can be taken for a new success in Raimi's work and his efforts are widely rewarded because the movie is already a huge commercial success in France . Even , if you can find faults in the film ( when Spider-Man flies in the air , the movie resembles pictures taken from a video game . The film also follows a classical outline typical from Hollywood scripts with a scientist acted by Alfred Molina who wants to use his power through his latest discovery to control New York . So , it seems that Spider-Man can be the only one to save the city . Then , the end of the movie which sees Maguire and Dunst united together lets suggest that Hollywood has been through that ) , you can only find pleasure in watching Raimi's film which should logically lean on to a third opus in the Spider-Man series . If it's the case , let's hope that Raimi will shot it and as far as I'm concerned , the success of " Spider-Man 2 " made me want to watch the first movie . But at the moment , for once that a follow-up is really successful , let's take advantage of it !
584286	1219578	89860	8.0	what lies beneath a cozy upper class mansion	Michel Deville is a French filmmaker known for his aesthetic refinement and " Péril en la Demeure " bears its author's trademark . It's filmed with elegance and everything from the scenery to the acting , the camera angles to the music without mentioning witty dialogs breathes the refined . One can't forget the neat link shots , the fluid editing that add to the pernicious charm this shady thriller exudes from its three exploited mainsprings : perversion , manipulation and voyeurism . Nearly everyone in this film is a peeping tom like the offbeat female neighborhood ( Anémone ) who films the lovemaking between the guitarist teacher David ( Christophe Malavoy ) and Julia ( Nicole Garcia ) or Julia's husband Graham ( Michel Piccoli ) who watched these lovemaking sessions on the videotape . As for the manipulation , Julia leads David up the garden path by making him believe that he killed her husband while seasoned killer Daniel ( Richard Bohringer ) tries to make him understand that he's got a mission to fulfill . Deville diverts the codes , the ingredients of the genre to his own advantage to create a stylish , idiosyncratic thriller and a mirror film directed to the viewer about his peeping tom side . It's easy to let oneself immerse in this universe and to forget the irregularities or glitches that undermine a little the storytelling even if Deville has recourse to zones of shadow and clues likely to explain the characters ' motivations . If the filmmaker bore this in mind , he can be forgiven for his possible mistakes .
585240	1219578	110776	8.0	taste of Yvonne	Adaptation of a novel by Patrick Modiano , " le parfum d'Yvonne " represents another Patrice Leconte's success . To make this film , the director drew from several elements dating from his previous movies . Thus , the doctor Meinthe ( excellent Jean-Pierre Marielle ) is very close to Michel Mortez in " Tandem " ( 1987 ) while Yvonne's sensual beauty evokes Mathilde's in " the hairdresser's wife " ( 1990 ) . So , Leconte turned a novel into a personal movie . This movie tells a past love story that brings on a deep nostalgia due to gorgeous summer pictures enhanced by a luminous photography . It's almost a poetic and dreamlike work . And however , this happiness is too good to be true . Indeed , behind this idle and free life , hide zones of shadows . Victor Chmara claims to Yvonne that he is a wealthy Russian earl but he's nothing of the sort . He's just a young man who fled Paris so as to avoid his military enlistment ( we are in 1958 and at this time , it is the Algerian war ) . Moreover , he wants to go to the USA but Yvonne refuses because Victor can't speak English . So , she leaves him and there's this famous sentence that says : love stories , in general don't have a happy ending . It is true . Leconte built his movie on a long flashback and he alternates the story with two of the main characters ' current situation . From this moment , we can take down a strong contrast between the shiny pictures of a celebrated and distant summer and the dark photography to connote a dull present that shows the main characters ' distress and bitterness ( especially the doctor Meinthe ) . A beautiful and bitter movie . If you are a fan of Patrice Leconte , don't miss this one .
583606	1219578	50367	8.0	So ahead of its time it remains indecipherable today .	This is HG Clouzot's most ambitious work , one of the most demanding and complex movie of a soon-to-be - nouvelle-vague France . Let's put it straight : although modern to a fault , " les espions " has nothing to do with the nouvelle vague : no " " free " camera here " , a bunch of " old actors " , a very elaborate screenplay . The problem is that it has nothing to do with the " old guard " either . The " story " flouts conventions , and HGC does not give a damn if his audience cannot catch up with it . The film was bound to be a commercial failure , particularly with an audience who got enthusiastic over " le salaire de la peur ' ( wages of fear ) and " les diaboliques " . The starting point may recall " the diaboliques " : in this latter work , a seedy boarding-school ; in " les espions " , a doctor short of the readies , whose clinic is sinking . So why not gladly agreeing a mysterious man's proposal ? One million francs , if he puts " them " up ? Who are " they " ? That's how the doctor's ( Gerard Sety ) nightmare begins . He is caught up in the system , and a lot of threatening characters ( played by topnotch international actors : Curd Jurgens , Martita Hunt , Sam Jaffe ) begin to show up : every time he thinks he begins to understand , the truth eludes him-Gérard Séty ' s character predates Laurence Harvey's in " the Mandchourian candidate " and even Michael Douglas's in " the game " . HGC watched the spies as if they were microbes under a microscope . It's a rather unpleasant view . Vera Clouzot-the unforgettable heroine of " les diaboliques " - appears in the role of a deaf and dumb neurotic woman ( She was to die of an heart attack three years later ) . Clouzot ' s health began to deteriorate during the sixties . After " les espions " he was to make only two works " la vérité " ( the truth ) one of Brigitte Bardot's best parts and " la prisonnière " . He made only 11 movies in all , which may not seem much , but most of them are among the best works French cinema has produced .
583196	1219578	74152	8.0	Children's realm .	When this film was released , one French critic , Gilles Colpart wrote that TRuffaut did better when he focused on a main character , Antoine Doinel , for instance . At least here , we do not have to stand Jean-Pierre Léaud's mannerism . The people who watch Léaud's movies dubbed in English cannot imagine how lucky they are . Gone is Léaud , gone is Truffaut's sometimes smugness and pretension . Here we find what Truffaut does best : a movie about children played by children ( he had brilliantly succeeded in the very hard task of bringing Victor the " wild child " to the screen ) A lot of humor ( a quality that is not generally Truffaut's forte ) , a lot of plots and subplots masterfully intertwined , no stars , and a lot of spontaneity too . These vignettes are often delightful : the reluctant student declaiming Molière , the girl who " has already slept with a boy " ( What did he do when you were in bed ? her best friend asks-Oh , he read a comic strip , was the answer ) , the boy who says to his friend's mother " thanks for this frugal meal " after having swallowed a whole lot of food . But Truffaut , present in the movie through the schoolteacher character , does not give up more serious topics : here mistreated children . After he discovered one of his pupils suffered such physical cruelty , the schoolteacher explains this problem to his school mates with delicacy and intelligence , as if they were adults . Don't miss this simple , yet heart-warming movie .
583073	1219578	384177	8.0	Bertrand Tavernier's 2004 vintage	Doctor Pierre Sézac ( Jacques Gamblin ) and his wife Géraldine ( Isabelle Carré ) a childless couple leave for Cambodgia to adopt one . When they arrive there , a real obstacle course awaits for them . Countless , various problems surface , wanderings from orphanages to orphanages amount to nothing and the courage and love of the young couple is put to a serious test . When I was in my first year at university , I remember that one of my courses was entitled reading comprehension and for my exams , the topic of this course was based on a conversation between a man and a woman who talked about this widely talked about society phenomenon that is children adoption in Southern Asia . The two protagonists particularly insisted on the testing process that parents had to go through to get their beloved one . Bertrand Tavernier confirms in images and in this harrowing story , the meandering road the Sézac couple take to satisfy their desire to adopt children . This giant in French cinema who has keep on producing varied great works for more than thirty years is a true auteur whose sincerity and commitment about a prickly topic is never questionable . Such is once again the case here with this film that is based on true facts . The difficulties , the problems which the Sézac couple comes up against may seem numerous and exaggerated . One can't help but think that there are true to life either they are of administrative source or that they involve bribery . Tavernier also pores over the problem of children adoption through the different French couples at the hotel . The adventure the Sézac couple has is their common adventure in which chance and fate can smile or leave them at any time . If one can be destabilized by the didactic even documentary side of the venture , one can't deny its strong heartfelt vibe . The background is also essential . Tavernier voluntarily chose a gritty tone and found place in his film to shake the viewer's nerves in front of Cambodgia ravaged by misery , war ( some sequences showcase some soldiers clearing of mines a part of the country ) , shameful traffics which constitute a serious break to child adoption . " Holy Lola " is a momentous work for two reasons : Tavernier added one more worthwhile piece of work to his own Aladdin's cave and also a work destined to the mainstream to make them realize of the hard process of child adoption . All the future parents who contemplate this step should have a look at it . And not only them but all those who are fond of topnotch French cinema .
583662	1219578	154509	8.0	A saint in Hell .	Those were the dark hours of the Occupation in France . The sinister Gestapo was torturing prisoners - some of whom were still almost children-in a jail where a German priest was trying to ease their terrible pain . This man was a Franciscan Brother ( hence the title ) but he was above all a man for whom all are brothers . This is German actor Hardy Kruger's lifetime part . He gives a restrained performance but he makes us feel his sympathy for these suffering people . As he is fluent in French , it's his voice we hear in this French movie . Claude Autant - Lara , who had tackled a highly topical subject at the beginning of the sixties ( conscientious objection , " tu ne tueras point " ) , made another courageous movie with " le Franciscain de Bourges " : the French audience , twenty years after WW2 , was perhaps not ready to learn that among devils there might have been good men . This is a true story . It was filmed where the events happened . Hardy Kruger refused any fee for his extremely moving part of Alfred , a saint in a living hell .
584017	1219578	47195	8.0	Ludwig , Wagner and Sissy .	Helmut Kautner's biopic of the famous king was dwarfed by Visconti's four-hour mammoth magnum opus ( 1972 ) . It did not deserve to fall into oblivion though . Of course people will complain because the writers passed over in silence the fact that this king was gay . In 1954 , what else could they do ? When they filmed Tchekovsky's life , they did the same . Some people will say that Helmut Kautner took the easy way out : he made Ludwig's so called impossible love for Sissi the reason why he did not marry . Visconti's Elizabeth was not fooled when she ironically asked her cousin : " you want me to be your impossible love ? " And however , I like this film : there are beautiful romantic scenes between OW Fisher and Ruth Leuwerick : " look at those clouds up above , they seem very near from each other but they are actually faraway " or " down there , it's eternity " . The pacifist side of the king is highlighted , which made him a man ahead of his time ; what could such a man do in the company of such wolves as Bismarck and the other politicians of the era . Klaus Kinski - nowadays the most famous actor of the movie - appears as Otto and he makes each of his three scenes count : particularly impressive is that scene when he feels the first effects of the madness : Visconti's Otto is rather bland by comparison . But the reason why you should give this movie a chance is its cinematography : the colors are splendid indeed , sometimes luminous when Sissy urges Ludgwig to remain pure , sometimes dark under an ominous sky when the king's megalomania knows no bound anymore . Dig that scene where the king and Sissy's sister Sophie are all alone in an opera theater and the girls breaks down crying " I cannot stand that anymore " . Wagner's music enhances all the film and Visconti's and Kautner's treatments are not that much different as far as the musician is concerned . At about the same Time , Ernst Marischka began his Sissy saga .
582581	1219578	53168	8.0	pickpockets of the Parisian unite	The year is 1959 and a bunch of aspiring filmmakers reunited under the sign of the New Wavelet plans to rejuvenate French cinema . To achieve their goals , one of the advocated solutions is to shoot their works in the street on natural location . One of their darlings Robert Bresson has the same idea but with one major difference : he's a whole better than any of them including François Truffaut and Jean Luc " God Ard " and his contribution to the Seventh Art is much more valuable than theirs ' . After having told a true story of an escape lived by a prison inmate during the Second World War with " Un Condamné à Mort s'est Echappé " ( 1956 ) , Bresson chose for his next film to shoot the everyday life of a pickpocket . In an interview from 1960 , Bresson cleverly noticed that the 1956 film began in prison and ended in liberty whereas it's the contrary for " Pickpocket " . Keeping a narrative process from " Journal d'Un Curé De Campagne " ( 1951 ) which is to show a written page from a textbook read by a voice-over while the following sequence shows us the action , the filmmaker introduces to us Michel's career as a thief , the techniques and processes employed by a pickpocket to steal his victims ' wallets and watches and important characters who try to make him come back to the " normal world " like Jeanne . From the beginning , Michel is a typical " Bressonian " hero . It means that he lives on the fringe of society but unlike other Bresson heroes , his intellectual ideas prompt him to claim his stake and he's proud not to be part of the crowd whereas other characters in Bresson's work become unconventional figures in spite of them like the young priest in " Journal d'Un Curé De Campagne " or dropouts such as Yvon later in " l'Argent " ( 1983 ) . As he says : " a few superiors human beings should find themselves above the laws " . In another extent , the notions of sin and redemption run throughout the work until the very last sequence which is likely to make many viewers ' imagination work . While I'm on this last point , Bresson never wanted the viewers to be lazy in front of his films but wished to arise stimulation among them . It means that you can think what you want about Michel's dangerous life and the famous last sequence . Bresson said that his film was especially a film of looks and gestures and he was right to think it . The sequences dealing with stealing are shot with care and in a somewhat distant manner . One of the filmmaker's goals was also to make us feel the loneliness which traps a thief . On this point , Michel is locked in his convinced theories and his resolute actions which means he can't listen to the people who are his contrary and he wanders all alone in the streets of Paris . His solitude is enhanced by the cramped attic in which he lives . Then Bresson perfectly managed to capture the feeling invoked when he robs someone and he well fulfilled his pledges . When Michel goes into action , a feeling of danger mingled with pleasure invades the screen and it is doubled when Michel " works " with other professional thieves . The apex finds itself in the station where all these thefts end up forming a dance . These key sequences as well as Jeanne's , the police officer's and Michel's friend Jacques attempts to make him see reason are dovetailed to give a highly-elliptical , limpid film . Like a good proportion of Bresson's works , it improves with each extra viewing . A documentary about this film was shot a few years ago in which the models talked about their roles in Bresson's magnum opus and how they changed their lives forever . Martin Lasalle currently lives in Mexico city and he's not the cold , young man one could expect to see . He's charming and funny .
583120	1219578	43164	8.0	Waltzing into darkness	The first thing to bear in mind is that , at the time , Michèle Morgan and Henri Vidal were the ideal French couple for sixteen-year old schoolgirls . They met when they were making " Fabiola " and they got married . Jean Grémillon and Albert Valentin do what they do best : setting a working class milieu against the bourgeois world ; the former had done " Gueule d'Amour " and " Lumière d ' Ete " , the latter had given " l'Entraineuse " and " la Vie de PLaisir " . This is the kind of " cinema-made-in-the-studio " which the Nouvelle Vague used to despise but it is this cinema which had lent credibility to the French films since the thirties . There's a striking contrast between the proles ' places ( the street , the uncle's restaurant , Etienne's bedroom , the small apartment where he thinks he ' ll lead a peaceful life with the woman he adores and their baby girl ) and the excessive luxury of the Voisin-Larive mansion . THe construction of the movie can disconcert the audience cause the director takes us from one world to the other one , without giving any explanations . MIchèle Morgan is the only link between them and it is only little by little that we discover the truth . Etienne ( Henri Vidal ) is a good guy , in the grand tradition of Jean Gabin's parts of " Quai des Brumes " or " Le Jour se Lève " . It is often mooted that Henri Vidal was a limited actor but his naiveté , his human warmth and his handsome smile work wonders here . His hope is to marry Irene who told him she was the Voisin-Larive's chamber maid . Irène ( Morgan ) is married to a rich bourgeois with whom she has no sexual relations . For him , she is a marvelous toy , a statue or a masterpiece , something decorative you can show when you throw a party . When Irene tells him she is pregnant ( by Etienne ) he does not care , he sends her to Switzerland . " I do not need any descendants " he says in a terrifying neuter voice . Jacques , the rich husband is some kind of monster . He is not evil , and the fact that he does not need children is downright disturbing , cause the bourgeois ' s dream is par excellence a dynasty , a boy who will continue his work . But this one seems selfishness itself . When Etienne - who still believes Irene is the chamber maid of the house - tells him his wife is pregnant by him , he finds it rather funny and does not give the game away . Jeanette , the less-than - attractive girl in love with Etienne , is the rejected person we had met in " Pattes Blanches " ( 1948 ) . Played by the same actress ( Arlette Thomas ) , she epitomizes hope against hope , she is a Cinderella whose pumpkin never turns into a horse-drawn coach . Both those heroines ( Jeanette and " Pattes Blanches " ' s young hunchback girl ) have a similar fate . Both think that a dress can make the job done , both were born to cry . This cinema-in-the-studio which I mention is often dazzling : there's a sublime shot of a prostrated desperate Morgan while a train is whistling and a hearse down there is crossing the street , a scene to rival the best of Sirk ( there's a similar scene in " a time to love and a time to die " ) . Those carols ( " Gloria in Excelsis Deo " ) become something as obscene as the dazzling Xmas decorations ( one finds the same refinement in the final scenes in the castle in " Pattes Blanches " ) when a child is dying . Those bourgeois , dancing in their luxury mansion , waiting for the clock which's going to strike twelve , is really a sickening sight . " There are so many ways to die " Irene says to Jeanette , and then , back home , she begins her waltz into darkness .
583445	1219578	104756	8.0	The miracle workers	It's impossible to remain indifferent to this family's sufferings . Susan Sarandon and Nick Nolte - in spite of his fake Italian accent - give superlative performances . That moment when Nolte is crying in his stairs is one of the most harrowing desperate scene I have ever seen . What's really extraordinary is that we do not always side with the parents . Sometimes , we think they are monsters to carry on a pointless fight . Sometimes we think that maybe the nurse who reads the fairy tale as if she were reading grocery's lists might be right . Two people who did not know anything about biology ( aside from what we learn in high school ) and who become capable of arguing against leading medical experts after studying books night after night deserve our undivided attention . " Laurenzo " is not an easy movie to watch ; it's not what you would call " entertaining " . For this family , the famous sentence " life is a daily struggle " takes on a terrible meaning . Recommanded .
582536	1219578	115744	8.0	evening glory	Grimley , a small mining town in the Yorkshire is at death's door . The pit which constitutes for many blue collars their sole course of action ( even their " raison d'être " ) is on the brink of closing down . A good number of them gathers to play in a brass band , the Grimley Colliery Band , led by Danny , a tubercular but steady conductor who devotes in it all his energy and this is where things go askew . If Danny advocates an intensive training and demands from his fellows more investment , his occasional musicians are more preoccupied by the impending closing down of the pit . And the arrival of a young woman , Gloria who works for the governmental agency who has to cut off the jobs antagonized many members . Then , in the space of a few days , things happen quickly : the minors choose to vote for voluntary unemployment , the pit closes down but in the meanwhile , the band wins several musical competitions which enable them to attend the finale in the prestigious Royal Albert Hall . It's a momentum concert to enable them to express their plight and their anger against Thatcherism . The director Mark Herman chose to locate his half-comic , half-tragic film in a prickly British era so as to stress the ravages of Thatcherism on the mining industry and to make the audience feel how much thousands of minors suffered by finding themselves jobless overnight . There are echoes with Ken Loach's cinema : the gloomy setting , a category of workers ( here , minors ) with a more than modest living standards and the same committed side to sympathize with their plight . However , Herman's piece of work contains a good dose of humor and it's not a free choice from the director to have incorporated it into his scenario . The very last sequences with their false air of happy-end and the rueful background would convey an impending sorrow . Herman perfectly understood that it was vital to include this component because the end of the film will abandon these castoffs to their fate . This indispensable humor usually linked with the brass musical sequences and cleverly tapped in the way it precedes according a more or less lapse of time a raw or gritty scene stops the movie from falling in a desperate blackness and paves the way to a formula Herman applied with gusto here : mix slightness with gravity . Inthis respect , his directorial style works wonders like this ingenious alternate editing in one scene when we see the orchestra play and the tension which arises in the put office and the declarations made by the manager to the journalists . But Herman's directing often rises to the occasion , notably during one of the key-moments : the finale scene . His camera , either makes itself as inconspicuous as possible to let the musicians take advantage of this moments either aerial to enhance it . Symbols are also the director's forte : the billiard ball which eventually succeeds in falling in the hole anticipates the film's finale whereas Phil's empty house after the bailiffs ' coming and the withdrawal of his wife and children reflects his despondent state of mind . Herman also shelved certain narrative conventions : the end of the film in which we don't smell any odor of " happy end " diverts the codes of the success story : these minors and occasional musicians will have won the national competition and known their hour of glory but it won't alter the murky future that awaits them . In a way the viewer identifies himself to the audience in the Royal Albert Hall : bitter , helpless and Danny's speech is of a harrowing speech . Then , in another extent , look at the love Andy ( Ewan McGregor ) feels for Gloria . Where a Hollywood director would have filmed their love affair from the beginning , Herman is more astute at this game and proceeds by small touches : we only sees close-ups of McGregor and lets the suggested filter through . The 2 young people will exchange their first kiss only in the very last sequence . It would be a crime to pass over the topnotch and true to life cast . The actors take their roles with an admirable easiness and naturalness . A special mention to Pete Dopplewaite , a chameleon actor who displays once again his exceptional gifts of actor ( remember the eerie Kobayoshi in Bryan Singer's " Usual Suspects , 1995 ) and Ewan McGregor whose career was buoyed the year the movie was open thanks to Danny Boyle with " Trainspotting " ( 1996 ) . It's just a shame that a certain Manicheism taints a little the film in the relationships between Gloria's boss and her ( he isn't treated as a caricature but the way he treats Gloria makes him an obnoxious character ) but it's minor quibble . " Brassed Off " is a wonderful piece of work straddling between laughter and emotion . When British cinema is able to incorporate laughter in a thorny social situation , it can shine and Mark Herman's flick is a good example , see it at any costs !
584644	1219578	58265	8.0	watch it , stupid .	A legend goes a s far as pretending that " kiss me stupid " is subpar . As far as Wilder comedies are concerned it's only one notch or two under the two Monroe ones and probably the underrated " avanti " , and probably superior to " apartment " " one two three " or " stalag 17 " Reductio ad absurdum that love between husband and wife is laudable , playing with every cliché you can think of and creating absolutely stunning scenes out of them . This is a movie one can only dream of , nowadays , when comedies are vulgar , not funny at all and gamble on audience's stupidity ( ! ) Once again , once more , Wilder ' s screenplay is exciting , witty , now delirious-the parrot watching the telly - , now almost dramatic - the scene when Walston throws a loaded Martin out of his home , this admirable sequence when Novak thinks that it would be great to be a housewife . Wilder plays with his characters , no one is in the right place , no one acts as if he's supposed to do , and , that's the miracle , everything will turn right . Invention is everywhere , in every scene , in every line of dialogue , even in these silly songs the hero and his pal want Dean Martin to sing ( check the words : " when I'm without you , I'm a Yorkshire pudding without a roast beef ( sic ) ) Wilder was a director who used to dare , provocation was his forte : from the name of the one-horse town ( Climax ) to the holier-than-thou woman who set up a petition against the " belly button " , this den of iniquity . And however , in the end , his movie is more " moral " than one hundred of these sanitized contemporary comedies . As I said , reductio ad absurdum .

Bearing more than a distant resemblance to Fanny Hurst ' s tear-jerker ( which was filmed in the thirties by Stahl and remade by Sirk in the late fifties ) , though the mother : daughter relationship is much more dramatic in Curtiz's film : whereas Bea and her daughter went though simple love rivalry , the problem of Veda and Mildred is much more complex : Veda is ashamed of her mother , because she feels ( maybe her paternal heredity ) her place is not in her mother's modest house . When her mother succeeds in business ( restaurants ) , - always the last refugee for the woman love is denied to ( see also " Only yesterday " " Mannequin " and of course " Imitation of live ; in " Written on the wind " , all that is left to Dorothy Malone is black gold business ) - , things get even worst : Mildred becomes a parvenu , a nouveau riche , nothing to do with the ( even if he is broke ) aristocracy Monte epitomizes . Superlative performances by Joan Crawford and the rest of the cast . In " Imitation of life " ( 1959 ) , it's the black girl who parades around ; in " Mildred " , it's the spoiled daughter who does .
584527	1219578	344604	8.0	the game of love and chance strikes again . . .	Antoine ( Daniel Auteuil ) is a head waiter in a chic Parisian restaurant and lives with his girlfriend Christine ( Marilyne Canto ) . His work occupies a lot of place in his life . One evening , by going through a park to be more quickly at his apartment , he saves from suicide a neurotic man Louis ( José Garcia ) . After vainly attempted to take him back to his close relatives , he takes him under his wing and succeeds to find him a job as a waiter in his workplace . Louis wanted to kill himself because his love affair with his ex girlfriend Blanche ( Sandrine Kiberlain ) went unravel . Antoine found her again because he wants to reconcile them again . She's a charming florist and , you guess it he becomes enamored of her . From then onwards , his well-ordered life starts to showcase signs of poor running . I'm a little surprised but glad to discover that this little high charged , hilarious comedy enjoys a small reputation abroad . About twenty reviews have already been posted for this film and most of them gave the movie thumbs up . I will post another positive one in spite of minor flaws Pierre Salvadori's film showcases . Some will be probably surprised but the outset reminded me of Jean Renoir's classic " Boudu Sauvé Des Eaux " ( 1932 ) , perhaps because of the quite prestigious situation the main protagonists of the films occupy and maybe also because they save from suicide ill-fated men who are cracking up . And then , the saved ones immerse themselves in their rescuers ' lives and disrupt their living environment . But although both movies are comedies , they don't belong to the same sub-category . Pierre Salvadori preferred not to follow the steps of the master which bestowed his own work with a strong social satire whiff . There's no trace of it in " Après Vous " , although there may be an inkling of it in the following sequence : when Antoine takes Louis in the cellar and shows him the names of the different wines . Louis is afraid not to recognize the right wines and I think that Antoine answers him the customers ape the connoisseurs and don't know anything about wines . The director preferred to choose the road of the sentimental comedy and to especially focus on Antoine's turbulent love life . Pierre Salvadori commands his film at arm's length and delays the most momentous moment of the movie ( the meeting between Louis and Blanche ) to better linger on Louis ' new life and especially on Antoine's love trouble . In a way , by making Louis work in his restaurant , by undertaking to reconcile him with Blanche and unfortunately by having a crush on her , he is a victim of his generosity . And Louis doesn't really realize the situations in which he puts Antoine . There's a funny sequence around the beginning of the film during which Antoine is at Louis ' grandmother's and tries to alter Louis ' suicide note in a placating , comforting letter . Then , deep down inside him , he thinks of leaving his ex girlfriend to live with Blanche and has to lie to his protégé and circle not to arouse suspicion about his real motivations . The movie becomes very enjoyable when it accumulates misunderstandings and embarrassing situations linked with Louis ' job as a waiter or Antoine's sentimental trouble which the latter tries to escape by hilarious means ( check the sequences in the Chinese restaurant ) . The scenario is also interspersed with droll lines : " how do you find the chicken ? Dead " . A threesome of actors serves the film . Daniel Auteuil is able to provide enough caliber to his character to watch the film until the tail end and I would like to congratulate the user " writer's reign " for the tasty pun he inserted in his review : " maitre d'Auteuil " . José Garcia who earlier showed in his career that he could hold comical as well as dramatic roles ( Philippe Harel's " Extension Du Domaine De la Lutte , 1999 ) shines as the neurotic , wound up Louis , indirectly responsible of Antoine's mishaps . At last , Sandrine Kiberlain , a little frail , naive but the director never ridicules her . She was ideally cast as Blanche . In French , this name is also an adjective which means white and the actress has a somewhat pallid face which suits well to both the name and the personality of her character . If the director honed his work with a palpable painstaking care for much of his work , there are little setbacks towards the end of the road . The end is thoroughly unexpected but was made in a rush and the trick of the lighter has been seen many times before . But these flaws aren't major enough to reject Salvadori's film . So , " Après Vous " and enjoy your film !
584721	1219578	89072	8.0	good Charlotte . . .	François Truffaut and Jacques Doillon who have often worked with children know well one thing : making a movie about childhood or adolescence is a quite difficult thing . Here , it is Claude Miller's turn to broach the delicate topic of adolescence . The less we can say is that he signed here a sensitive and bitter work that brings out enough strength and emotion to compare with the filmmakers ' movies previously quoted . The first indisputable quality that we can put forward is the following one : Claude Miller's film is very far from the clichés generally attributed to teenagers . Charlotte isn't a nymphet , only a teenage girl who is not a happy person and who's searching for love and understanding . The director succeeds very well in making us share his heroine's profound discontentment and Charlotte Gainsbourg won a well-deserved Oscar for her remarkable performance . Apart from the relevant and convincing description of Charlotte , Miller painted a series of characters who are never on the edge of caricature . Lulu is perhaps a naive little girl and the director somewhat made her look ugly by giving her glasses but he does everything to hide her dumb air . Then , Charlotte's father is presented as a good man and faced with her daughter's insolence , he can contain his anger . One last example , Clara's manager is not obsessed with money . With Charlotte Gainsbourg , it would be unfair to neglect the rest of the cast . Either the actors are young or old , they all have a common point : they are all excellent . This only confirm one gift that Claude Miller had already shown in his first movie , the harrowing " la meilleure façon de marcher " ( 1976 ) : an excellent direction of actors . Besides , like in " la meilleure façon de marcher " ( 1976 ) , " l'effrontée " ( 1985 ) is a perfectly stable movie , both funny , touching and where Miller skilfully alternates moments of tension and calm and the rare moments of violence are only suggested like the scene when Charlotte hits Jean with his globe . Quite obviously , what mainly interested the director in this film is Charlotte's relationship with the most important character of the film : Clara Baumann . Their confrontations constitute the key-moments of the movie . Clara is a talented young pianist and Charlotte blindly idolizes her . She is ready to believe everything she says , even when Clara confides to her that she would like to become her impresario on tour . It is interesting to note down that when she talks about Clara , Claude Miller gently laughs at her naivety . More important , through their relationship , Miller compared their respective worlds . The music used ( the song " Sarà , perché ti amo and Mozart ) reveal the incompatibility of these worlds and the beginning of the sketched friendship ( but is it really friendship ? ) is eventually bound to fail . To tell this failure , Miller proceeds by little touches : the manager's telephone that doesn't answer , Lulu who creates a scandal during the show . This failure clearly shows Charlotte's disillusion but it doesn't stop the movie to end on a positive tone : when we see the heroine take care of Lulu , she seems to have understood that her place is among her family . The movie also contains another strong point : the relationship between Jean and Charlotte where Miller favors the progressive rise of tension . For this , he uses the same method as Charlotte's failure with Clara : he proceeds by little touches : the movie they watch at the cinema is " the Exorcist " ( 1973 ) and the tension gradually grows and explodes when they are in Jean's hotel room . I must admit that I don't know enough Claude Miller's work . I only saw " la meilleure façon de marcher " ( 1976 ) , " la petite voleuse " ( 1988 ) and this one " l'effrontée " ( 1985 ) but these three films were sufficient to make me a very good impression of this filmmaker and I am long to discover his other opus .
584295	1219578	13933	8.0	Hearts divided	" Coeur Fidèle " is a very simple story : Marie ' s in love with Jean , but she is forced to marry Petit Paul , who , in spite of his name , is an alcoholic brute . Epstein's script was probably inspired by the novelists from the nineteenth century , probably Victor Hugo and Emile Zola . Marie is nobody's child : she was brought up by a shrew and her husband who never showed some affection to her : she is akin to Cosette or Fantine in " les Miserables " . Petit Paul seems to come from Zola's " L'Assommoir " the seventh volume in the Rougon-Macquart saga . Marie and Jean are unfortunate lovers ; Jean is a good man , in the noblestsense of the word . Epstein's closest relative in the cinema field is Frank Borzage in " Coeur Fidele " , with whom he shares the same fascination for the fair and the merry-go-rounds ( see " little man what now ? " ) Like Abel Gance , Epstein was a pioneer : the scene on the fairground has a sense of madness which makes the viewer dizzy ; it predates Hitchcock's experimentations in " Strangers on a train " by thirty years . For that scene alone , the movie would be essential viewing ; with the addition of another extraordinary scene when the crippled girl , whose crutch has been crushed by a car crawls all along the way to save her friends , it becomes a major twenties French classic .
584666	1219578	60138	8.0	Les mémoires d'un âne	During the nineteenth century , the comtesse de Segur wrote a novel for the children called " memoirs of a donkey " . A very pious writer , she chose the donkey as a symbol of humility . . . as Robert Bresson did I suppose . The very first pictures of the movie , with the children , " christening " the donkey , might be a nod to the writer whom the young Bresson , like all his generation must have read when he was a young boy . " Au hasard Balthazar " is an updated version of " les memoires d'un ane " , but a very austere story : although Bresson's work enjoys a very high rating on the site , I must say that it's not for all tastes . I cannot imagine , say , a " matrix " fan getting enthusiastic about it . Bresson's actors are non - professionals - with the exception of Anne Wiazemski , but it was her debut ; then she became the par excellence intellectual actress , for the likes of Godard , Tanner and Garrel , all directors that easily make me yawn my head off - , but do not expect a " natural " performance . I hope the non-French speaking who wrote a comment saw the movie in French with English subtitles . Dubbed in another language , Bresson's works lose a lot of their originality . Because the actors speak in a distant voice , in a neutral style as if they were reciting Descartes's " the Discourse on Method " . They never show any emotion , even through their darkest hour ( not even after the heroine's rape ) . Bresson films his human characters as if they were Martians , and his sympathy for the donkey is the only pity he has to give us . This beast of burden seems to carry on its back all the sins of the world , and his route is a calvary . A woman says " this donkey is a saint " . Bresson showed us the Beast in Man and the Man in Beast .
585476	1219578	31088	8.0	Beautiful Gesture .	People who know Julien Duvivier's " la bandera " ( 1935 ) will find analogies between the two movies . In both of them , the legion is an escape from law . The approach is different however : in " la bandera " , the hero and his mates are simple , crude people . In Wellmann's work , they are distinguished , " noblesse oblige " characters . Wellman's movie has a romantic flavor , which is totally absent in Duvivier's pessimistic story . It seems that " beau geste " has worn well , better than Duvivier's dated saga . Both movies have the same flaw : the Tuaregs are the " villains " , we absolutely know nothing about them . In Duvivier's movie , we don't even see them , and they are always referred to as " the bastards " ( sic ) They seem reduced to attacking baddies , an entity whose humanity is denied . Wellmann's superiority lies in the fact that he plays the game of adventure , now matter how unlikely it is while Duvivier has " realist " ambitions . Wellmann smartly blends a whodunit with pure adventure elements . The solution of the mystery , which we learn at the very end of the movie is very unexpected and gives the movie some kind of Hustonian touch ( and in 1939 , Huston had yet to make a movie ! ) As for the directing is concerned , the last third of the movie shines . If the legion routine life scenes inside the fort are inferior to those of Duvivier , on the other hand its finale is more moving and more astonishing . The sergeant , using dead bodies as scarecrows , is almost surrealist and might have influenced the conclusion of Anthony Mann's " Cid " . A scene we saw at the beginning , " the Viking funeral " finds an absolutely brilliant explanation . While John ( Ray Milland ) is preparing the " ceremony " in a fort full of dead bodies , we don't realize . It's only when he explains to his brother ( yes , there was a dog at his feet ) that we understand . A very fine cast , including Susan Hayward on the threshold of a brilliant career ( it's her second movie ) . The title is justified too . Because " Beau Geste " means in French " Beautiful gesture " . NB : A trip to Norway taught me this : the Vikings were buried in the ground on their boats .
584737	1219578	266697	9.0	an apparently trivial story transcended in a stylish treatment	" One of these days , I'm going to cut you into little pieces " ( Pink Floyd , One of These Days , Meddle , 1971 ) . I have often written in some reviews on this site that I wasn't a big fan of Quentin Tarantino , a cinema-going filmmaker with a mind-boggling culture . It's true that I have never been very taken with " Pulp Fiction " ( 1994 ) . As for " Kill Bill : Vol . 1 " , I had deemed it as " violent and hollow " . I maintain the first epithet but I jettison the second one now . I watched it again last Saturday night with its other brother " Kill Bill : Vol . 2 " ( that I hadn't seen before ) and I changed my mind about it . I realized that I had overlooked it and I would go as far as saying that I found it much better than Tarantino 1994 film . The staple story doesn't carry much weight . A wedding in the desert takes a tragic dimension when all the guests are killed except the Bride who spends four years in a coma . When she wakes up , she's got one sole word in her mind : revenge . On a scrap of paper , she noted down the names of the ones who made of her wedding a tragedy and is well determined to kill them all . She also keeps the best for the end : Bill . This story is for Tarantino almost a pretext to beef it up with sources coming from different horizons : comic strip , spaghetti western , samurai film and even video games in the elaboration of the fight sequences . And animated by a cinema passion , the filmmaker couldn't resist to the desire to include film-loving details throughout the Bride's adventures . Thus , the title of the second chapter is entitled if my memory serves me well : " the Bride wore blood " . It's of course a hint at François Truffaut's film , " la Mariée Etait en Noir " ( 1968 ) , a film on which Truffaut himself didn't have a warm spot . I have just mentioned the term chapter since the film and its companion are divided into chapters and Tarantino isn't afraid of subverting storytelling conventions by showcasing chapters in a chronological disorder like his previous efforts . The technical command of " Kill Bill : Vol 1 . " leaves speechless . First , I would like to congratulate Tarantino for the cinematography he tapped . It enhances bright colors , especially the red and one thing I noticed : in the first sequence of the film , Uma Thurman drives a vehicle with red seats . In Jean-Luc Godard's " Pierrot Le Fou " ( 1965 ) , the red is also a dominating color . In one scene , Jean Paul Belmondo and Anna Karina are in a car with red seats . If I don't understand at all the symbolical function of the red in Godard's highbrow work , in Tarantino's work , his symbolic is blatant according to the story and the Bride's motivations . Red is revenge , violence , death . This revenge story is filmed with virtuosity to its recesses where nothing is left to chance . It's tempting to deem the introduction of some characters as filler but it's necessary to reveal and consolidate their persona . And throughout these chapters , Tarantino taps all the cinematographic possibilities to bestow and embellish the form to the service of his intentions ( to pay homage to the samurai film among others ) and the contents . Thus , one of the moments of the film is showcased under the form of a Japanese cartoon film and for perhaps one of the most momentous moments ( the scene when the BRie kills some 80 masked enemies , Tarantino borrowed a device from Hitchcock he used in his mind-boggling " Psycho " ( 1960 ) : to shot an incredibly violent fight sequence in black and white not to show the red blood . Besides and while I'm on this sequence as well as the others that involve fights , they are so well choreographed and set with clockwork precision that they can emulate , even outclass the ones of " the Matrix " saga . And as many film buffs know it , one of Tarantino's recognizable signs is his pronounced taste for bloody violence . For " Kill Bill : Vol . 1 " , he didn't shelve it but this violence is virtually all blood and thunder and watching ripped or pierced body parts or whole bodies , slashed arms and legs becomes highly great fun . Thrill-seekers will be overjoyed and the height is reached when the Bride before facing Lucy Liu declares to them : " don't try to get back your missing parts ! " . Tarantino even grants some importance to some apparently trivial things like for instance the Japanese man who sells to the Bride a clean saber writes on the mist of a window , the one whom the Bride wants to get rid of at the end of her list ( you guessed who it is of course ) or when the Bride tries to move her big toe after her coma . It's exciting cinema as one could wish and for Tarantino whose target was partly to pay homage to the samurai movies with which he grew up , he delivered the goods : to spend a truly great cinema moment . The different cinematographic devices and tricks interlock with easiness and fluidity . What about my judgment of the volume 2 ? The answer in my review about it . NB : there's perhaps this unlikeliness in Tarantino's scenario . When the Bride gets out of the hospital and finds herself in the underground parking , thirteen hours pass by before she can feel her feet again . But during this time the staff at the hospital must have realized her departure . Why don't they find her again after such a long time ? It's a minor detail .
585455	1219578	59043	9.0	The crowning of Wyler's career	In the sunny , too sunny country , very nasty things happen . A young man goes chasing butterflies which he kills and adds to his collection . But there's more . . . William Wyler , unfairly deemed " academic " , gave with " the collector " his most sustained piece of work in the sixties . With the impressive exception of " best years of our lives " ( 1945 ) , it might simply be his very best movie . He really took to new limits the psychological drama in huis clos he had already tackled in the past ( little foxes ( 1941 ) , the heiress ( 1949 ) , detective story ( 1951 ) ; desperate hours ( 1955 ) ) But none of these strong works equal " the collector " : they often verge on melodrama , convention and sentimentality . None of these setbacks show up in the 1965 work : it's definitely a modern one , ahead of its time , and of which any great director of the planet would be proud . Using only two characters - John Huston did it before in " heaven knows , Mr Allison " ( 1957 ) , but with less startling effects-Wyler sustains interest and suspense till the very end . And I would go as far as saying that the ending prolongates the suspense , because it's an incredible conclusion , thoroughly immoral ( I really wonder why the censorship did not ask Wyler to " sweeten " it ) Terence Stamp is the collector , and he's probably never been better than in this deadly story . Not only he predates Hannibal , copycats , bone collectors and co for three decades , but he runs the whole gamut of emotions : this character was unique for the time , with only Karl-Heinz Boehm's " peeping tom " character ( 1960 ) as a contender . He is a socially washout , an obscure clerk , his colleagues ' laughing stock , his only family is a ridiculous auntie , no future prospects , no love of his own , alife unfulfilled to a fault . To think that it takes the director a one - minute black and white flashback to let us know about his hero's background ! Matching him every step of the way is Samantha Eggar's sensational portrayal of Miranda , the young girl he kidnaps and holds in a cellar . She's his prisoner , but he's a prisoner too : of his phantasms , obsessions . The young man suffers in his flesh and his mind , in spite of his impassive face - Compare Wyler's work with Stamp here with that of Fellini in " spirit of the dead , part 3 " Tobby Dammit " : although Stamp is outstanding in the Italian's work too , he's much more convincing here because the " academic " Wyler remains in control of his actor . What Stamp cannot forgive Miranda , and the whole world outside it the normal , legal , licit , - the society approves of it - , side of her happiness , her " joie de vivre " ( check the first pictures of her ) . Maybe her parents are not that much rich , but her father is a doctor and thanks to him , she's an art student , she's access to culture and to the in crowd , whereas he will always remain a misfit and a dunce . THe " catcher in the rye " sequence reveals the gap between them . The amour fou which Stamp feels for Eggar will remain platonic because he respects her too much - " respects " is the keyword , it comes at every dialogue . But maybe it's because Miranda ' culture puts her on a throne , an inaccessible icon , which makes the epilogue one of the most terrifying ever filmed . The cinematography and Maurice Jarre's music are also brilliant assets for a movie that should be missed on no account . This was to be Wyler's swansong : his last three movies are disappointing : " how to steal a million dollars " is another comedy , " funny girl " a vehicle for B . S . and " the liberation of L . B . Jones " , just exploited the success of " in the heat of the night " " The collector " must be regarded as his artistic testament .
584833	1219578	301357	9.0	guten Tag Meisterwerk !	With " Goodbye Lenin ! " ( 2003 ) , German cinema is very well and by showing that it can deliver a true gem from time to time , it still reserves us good surprises . Besides , the commercial triumph of the film abroad was precisely a surprise . True , it filled with enthusiasm about 6 million of German spectators which is nearly normal since the action unfolds during a key-date of their history : 1990 but one didn't expect that the movie would ride high in the box-offices of numerous countries in the world . I think this success is witness of a comforting thing : there are still many people in the world with a taste for a cinema of quality . I noticed that for a while , German cinema has the gift to reject hackneyed topics or to renew them through an unexpected treatment as the frenzied " Lola Rennt " ( 1998 ) showed . Or otherwise , it can favor new ideas . " Goodbye Lenin ! " definitely ranks in the second category . Basically , there's an original idea that we have never seen treated on the screen : to tell on a comic mode the reunification of Germany and Berlin in 1990 . This idea is very well exploited and gives a watertight screenplay which constitutes the main strength of the film . The heart of the movie begins in October 1989 . Because she saw her son beaten as he was demonstrating in the street to demand more liberties , Christiane Kerner had a coronary and went into a deep coma for several months . In the meantime , wall of Berlin fell down . When she awoke , communist system has disappeared and left place for a gigantic capitalist economy with , among others Coca-Cola and Burger King as its symbols . Eager not to cause her a second coronary that could kill her , her son Alex , with the help of his friends and close relatives decides to reconstitute in her mother's bedroom , life as it was during the communist system . On the paper , " Goodbye Lenin ! " is , first , to be taken as an inventive situation comedy which from a fragile topic unlikely to hold well water , increases the sudden new developments and continually revives the spectator's attention . It is sufficient to read the end of the previous paragraph to have an overall idea of the situation and to begin to smile . Just try to imagine this : a bedroom decorated and furnished like during the communist time in the middle of Berlin that is converted to the capitalist rules with in the background significant events which happen to Germany in 1990 like its victory at the World Cup or the day it celebrated its reunification on 03 October 1990 . So , this bedroom was conceived by Alex and unlike his friends and close relatives who try to " rock ( in their own way ) in the newly free world " , he isn't really touched by the wonders but also the excess of the capitalist world . Her mother's frail health is much more on his mind and he fully devotes himself to take care of her and not to reveal her the truth about Berlin since the 09 November 1989 . One must recognize that the process ( hare-brained if they are ) designed to avoid a deadly shock to her mother are of an impressive ingenuity like the false television news and it works for Christiane can't see anything . Although " Goodbye Lenin ! " belongs to the register of the comedy , the director Wofgang Becker is a real master of the suspense and brilliantly handles the delaying effect . Indeed : to which extent , Alex can invent or find tricks likely not to shock her mother ? And to which extent can the latter accept to be well treated until she gets tired of comforting but boring words like " You can't go out Mum . You've got to rest " ? If she fully recovers , will Alex have to tell her that Berlin is under the capitalist influence ? I don't want to reveal much of the film but go and see for yourself . On a second degree , " Goodbye Lenin ! " can also be read as a satire of the former communist system . The bedroom can be considered as a metonymy of East Berlin , even of the whole communist world . Beside this satire , Wolfgang Becker describes with a touch of irony , wonders but also exaggerations of the capitalist universe and reactions of the former inhabitants of East Berlin are always pertinent , either it is wonder ( customers in a video shop hypnotized by a porn movie ) or nostalgia ( Alex's old neighbor who regrets the former communist system ) . Overrall , " Goodbye Lenin ! " is a refreshing and witty work from start to finish that cleverly and skilfully exploits an original idea . Tinged with a huge tenderness for its characters , especially Christiane , it contains sequences which would deserve to go down in the history of cinema because they are true anthology moments . Those who have seen the movie may know which sequences I am thinking of . A movie which strikes right at the heart just like Yann Tiersen's simple but efficient original soundtrack which should delight numerous piano players .
584429	1219578	12745	9.0	Greed	This is an excellent adaptation of Zola's much-debated novel about the peasants , the 15th volume in the Rougon-Macquart saga . A lot of people thought when the book was published , that Zola gave to the world a too pessimistic vision of the people from the country , that he showed them as beasts . It's a far cry from George Sand's pastoral works such " La Mare Au Diable " or " La Petite Fadette " . André Antoine focused his movie on the patriarch , Le Père Fouan , whereas the novel had no central character but a profusion of cupid tight-fisted greedy men and women , each one more despicable than the one before . As the book was part of the Rougon-Macquart saga , Zola had to introduce one member of that family into the story : Jean Macquart plays a similar part to that of Etienne in " Germinal " . And he is featured in the movie too ; even Uncle Charles is showed , in a very short sequence and there is a hint at his " sweets shop " , in fact a brothel . Le Père Fouan wants to retire , so he divides up his land between his two sons , Buteau - who got a girl pregnant and is waiting for his share to marry her - and Jesus - Christ - who lives with his daughter , La Trouille ( = Jitters and not " Pest " as the subtitles read ) , by poaching , and his daughter Fanny , a fanatical about cleanliness . Le Père Fouan seems at first the only positive character ( with the exception of Jean , but Jean is an outsider ) , a victim of his offspring's ungratefulness : but he is much like them when he hides his " treasure " . Le Père Fouan realizes in the admirable scenes that the land should not have been divided ( " look what the ants do with it " one of his pals says ) ; he used to own this land , this ocean of fields on the plains around Chartres ( the movie was filmed on location ) , and now , he is only looking for a place to live in . But it's too late and only the earth can greet him . Directed by André Antoine ; one of his assistants was none other than Julien Duvivier , whose legendary pessimism would show in his masterpieces .
584732	1219578	378194	9.0	the adventures of the Bride , round 2	Here comes the Bride again in what was one of the most-anticipated films of 2004 which like its elder brother " Kill Bill : Vol . 1 " ( 2003 ) generated much hype . So far , she killed two important enemies ( and many more into the bargain ) and so erased two names on her list . There are still three left including Bill who will come last . Through its title , " Kill Bill : Vol . 2 " is both a sequel and a non-sequel . The Bride perseveres in her vengeful adventure still related in a chronological disorder but in some chapters or telling flashbacks , Quentin Tarantino reveals us some facts of her past life , notably how she became an expert at martial arts and so how she acquired her knowledge in this domain . Otherwise , this second installment is here to illustrate the famous sentence : " revenge is a dish best served cold " . And like its elder brother " Kill Bill : Vol . 1 " ( 2003 ) , it's still painstakingly shot . The composition of every sequence , the way they interlock even the position of the characters . Everything is precise , set in a pedantic manner and filled with neat visual or scenarist ideas . About this , I would like to mention the first sequence , the key one which is the origin of the Bride's bloody , vengeful adventure . It's of course , the famous massacre scene in the church isolated in the desert . Tarantino favored off-camera so we will see almost nothing of it but the sounds of the massacre . Another scene is the fight between Uma Thurman and Daryl Hannah . Tarantino pulls it off with gusto to insert a violent fight in a cramped place which is a trailer . Then like in the great tradition of the film in which two antagonist protagonists confront each other , the filmmaker delays the final , decisive meeting between them until the end and when this moment will arrive , it won't be what the audience will expect in its construction and its evolution . Like in its elder companion , the Bride perseveres in her desire of revenge and its fulfillment and as for Tarantino , he continues in his quest to pay homage to essentially the samurai film and the spaghetti western . Thus , " Kill Bill : Vol . 2 " is filled with cinema-going details , borrowings or influences , here mainly linked to the second cinematographic genre . John Ford and Sergio Leone's worlds are quoted and in another extent , I wonder whether the scene when Budd buries alive the Bride in the ground wasn't influenced by George Sluizier's chilling " Spoorloos " ( 1988 ) . But " Kill Bill : Vol . 2 " differs from its elder brother on numerous points . About the influences , if the samurai film was essentially to the fore in the first installment , the second one favors the spaghetti western , would it be only by the scenery and the barren landscapes . And as many users pointed out before , violent fights were the most momentous scenes in " Kill Bill : Vol . 1 " , at least the scenes which were the most vivid to the audience . These scenes take a back seat in " Kill Bill : Vol . 2 " in spite of the admirable fight sequence I mentioned above . An increasing psychological tension in the confrontations between the characters reigns during a good part of the movie . Besides , the first sequence which partly showcases a long conversation between the Bride and her worst enemy Bill sets the scene for this chosen perspective . So , action and stunts are relegated to a position of secondary importance to leave the place to long , chatty sequences but Tarantino could have deleted Bill's superfluous words about Superman . Be that as it may , it was maybe the best choice from Tarantino because these long conversations have several functions : to act as a counterbalance to the choreographed action scenes , to unveil the characters ' motivations and for the Bride , eloquent bribes of her past . This assumed side from Tarantino to put the accent on the dialogs ( very good in most of them ) enables to appreciate the performances of the whole cast and this , perhaps more than in the debut opus . Minor characters aren't forgotten and I would grant a distinction to Michael Madsen as Budd , perhaps the best of the batch . The pinnacle of his acting has to be found in the scene when he's about to bury alive the Bride , he just has to say simple but formidable words to tame her . I repeat it : I'm not really a Tarantino devotee but I have a warm spot on these two " Kill Bill " movies and I would trade " Pulp Fiction " ( 1994 ) for this duo of films . Various influences from diverse horizons were melded to give two well-rounded flicks which in spite of their different contents complete themselves . Was it wise from Tarantino to release it on two volumes ? I think so because if the two films had been bridged end to end , it would have given a spotty , irregular film . So , it was perhaps necessary to divide two distinct parts .
585357	1219578	40989	9.0	Learning by doing .	Dedicated to Mrs Montessori ( Italy ) , Mr . Claparède ( Switzerland ) , Mr Bekulé ( Tchecoslovakia ) , Mr Décroly ( Belgium ) and to Mr Freinet ( France ) . The latter's wife contributed to the screenplay , and Monsieur Pascal is none other than Célestin Freinet . Celestin Freinet who was wounded in WW1 , and thus could not talk very much so had to find new methods which revolutionized teaching skills . Unlike Monsieur Pascal , he did have to resign and to create his own schools . Even today , even if you are not in a Freinet school , you can feel his influence here there and everywhere : if it had not been for him , education would perhaps have remained purely theoretical . Now for the film . First of all , this is a GOOD movie , nay , a splendid one , regarded in context . Jean-Paul Le Chanois , too often dismissed by those fusty Cahiers Du Cinema ( which should be relegated to the archives , we are in 2007 dash it ! ) , outdoes himself and gives his best film ever . Bernard Blier is wonderful as Monsieur Pascal . We all would like to be his pupils . With him , gone is the iron discipline , gone is the lesson you learned by heart even if you did not understand a single word of it , gone is the dunce the teacher shamefully hides in the back of his classroom . Monsieur Pascal loves all his pupils , he wants to give them all a chance : the classroom's dunce , reciting the 1789 Declaration des Droits de L'Homme et du Citoyen - which is much more important to Mr Pascal , and now to the youngster himself than the futuretense , an arithmetic operation or the Sun King's death - in front of the board of examiners during his " Certificat d ' Etude " ( certificate formerly obtained by pupils at the end of primary school ; it no longer exists ) climaxes the movie . WW1 was just over - and in 1948 , when the film was made , WW2 was just over too - so the time had come to face the changes . . Pascal displays the same enthusiasm , the same faith in man and the same joie de vivre as the youth of Jacques Becker's " Rendez-vous de Juillet " . He believes in social advancement : the antique dealer's attitude is revealing , by preventing the old lady from selling for a song her valuable piece of furniture , they begin to rebel against the establishment for the first time : for that man , being part of the city council has got the power in his hands . " Let there be light " is Mr Pascal's motto . When he sees an old typewriter he thinks " printing " and as Gutenberg did at the end of the Middle Ages , he is ready to take his pupils out of obscurantism . Another remarkable fact : the women , who did not vote , who were not part of the city council are often smarter than their hubbies . A blind woman " feels " the good vibrations , she feels that now children are happier , more responsible . Only naive viewers are still thinking that Truffaut was the first to turn his attention to the brats ' misfortunes in Rousseau's land . Le Chanois was one on the first to start a mini-woman ' s lib : this is already present here , this will be more obvious in " Le Cas Du Docteur Laurent " ( 1957 ) , a plea for painless childbirth . Joseph Kosma's music is magnificent : during the cast and credits , it is so stirring , so infectious that we are sure the film will not disappoint us . Something like the music George Van Parys would write for " Si Tous Les Gars du Monde " ( 1956 ) . This tuneful piece will be used again music box style when the children draw the poor cat's story and sung by the whole classroom to support their dear teacher threatened by the antique dealer and his bourgeois friends . There are so many things to write about " l'Ecole Buissonnière " : teachers of the world , you have got to see it . . . . and to show it to your pupils to make them comprehend how lucky they are to work with their computers , in their modern classrooms : there was a time when teachers had to invent everything : a water-powered electric generator which the children , learning by doing , built , and let there be light !
585460	1219578	118015	9.0	witty , funny , no vulgarity : all that a good comedy can ( and must ) be	The movie " Cuisines et Dépendances " ( 1993 ) had revealed Jean Pierre Bacri / Agnès Jaoui's original talent . Here , " un air de famille " ( 1996 ) which is once again an adaptation of a play written by the duo constitutes a kind of extension and especially a clear improvement for them . This movie made by Cédric Klapisch is very superior to the first quoted movie although " Cuisines et dépendances " is a worthy work . The meeting Bacri-Jaoui-Klapisch shines to delivers a stunning flick . It is difficult to tell because it is so rich and crowded with incident that it would take several pages to sum it up . So , to tell you the main reasons that justify the vision of this film , I will go to the essential . 3 things confer to the movie a strong appeal . First , the scriptwriters have the remarkable gift to make sparks fly from the single cue and to let what is left unsaid and the suggested leak out . Dialogs are also their best weapon to revamp the middle-class ' image but also to harm the characters ' meanness and faults . This last feature enables to Bacri and Jaoui to distinguish themselves in the French comedy . It is their recognizable stamp to disclose certain faults that we have inside us but which we really don't want to admit . In this way , it is quite easy to identify with the characters . We have a little " air de famille " with them . But " un air de famille " is also worth for Klapisch's accurate making with an outstanding work on the lighting effects . The lighted café contrasts with the dark restaurant in the background of the scenery . Moreover , the split of the family amazingly answers to the dreary aspect of the scenery . Little by little , the film becomes a stifling In Camera tempered by a few sequences which relate childhood memories . In another extent , there's another strong point from Klapisch : the directing of actors which is flawless and well studied . Personally I think it is a real treat to see Jean Pierre Bacri coming and going in his café , with his sullen look . Beside him , Catherine Frot is irresistible in her role of silly woman while Jean Pierre Darroussin is the sole stable character in the middle of this family which is slowly breaking up . He also tries to bring his support and comfort to the members . " Un air de famille " is a smart and ferociously funny movie . Jean Pierre Bacri and Agnès Jaoui rank among the finest comical authors of the nineties and Cédric Klapisch can without problem join the group of the best French film-makers of his generation . Don't miss this movie which will give you another image of the French comedy .
582775	1219578	52918	9.0	Exponential melodrama	The greatness in this movie essentially lies in the two black characters . The scene at school when the young daughter is ashamed of her mother is unforgettable . As for Juanita Moore's funeral , it might be the most moving final a movie can have : a cast of thousands , Mahalia Jackson , and the prodigal daughter who cries over her mother's coffin screaming " forgive me mama " . Douglas Sirk gets away with the honors : such a tear-jerker screenplay could have been disastrous with any lesser talent . The Lana Turner / John Gavin affair is much more conventional and the story of the woman who prefers movie stardom ( imitation of life ? ) to the warm love of a good man ( " true " life ? ) has been told before . Besides , one can wonder where is the " true " life and where is the " imitation " . You've got to be a real macho like Gavin's character to think that a woman is born to be a housewife . Don't forget your box of kleenex .
584829	1219578	74910	9.0	In cold blood	René Allio was certainly one of the most overlooked French directors . " Moi Pierre Rivière " is his towering achievement but do not miss his earlier works such as " La Vieille Dame Indigne " , based on a Brecht short story . " Moi Pierre Rivière " could be subtitled " anatomy of a murder " . It's a true story which happened in the rural Normandie in the nineteenth century but anyway , those peasants , anyone who has read Maupassant's short stories or Zola's " La Terre " already knew them . Pierre Rivière cut the throat of his mother , his brother and his sister and is waiting for his trial . In the meanwhile , he writes a manuscript where he tells the whole story . Witnesses appear too and tell the story as they've seen it . Allio's treatment is anything but derivative . Sometimes Bressonesque ( his major influence ) with his use of non-professionals actors for his peasants , and their neuter voices , with something borrowed from Truffaut's " L'Enfant Sauvage " ( 1970 ) - screenplay entirely based on historical documents - . Pierre is a complex character , whose behavior thoroughly eludes the viewer . He sees his father , a crude uneducated meek man humiliated and harassed by a shrew of a mother , who always lets him down after she's taken everything she can steal . Probably under an over-possessive mother's thumb , this woman does not want to share her husband's home . Pierre's report is stunning : the style is perfect , using a very refined French , most of the verbs in the historical past ( Passé Simple ) a tense which increases the distance between Pierre and the events he depicts . He even uses the subjunctive imperfect , a tense only an educated person can know . Pierre is an enigma to the world : how a boy who was nurtured in such a demeaning milieu can he be able to write like this ? He bought a book , some kind of mini-encyclopedia where he found subjects ( Napoleon , Indians ) which fueled his misogyny . Is he a lunatic ? Certainly not in the way the doctor thinks he is during the trial . The fact Pierre refers to Abraham and the " God told me to do that " thing are not surprising , coming from a country boy , at a time when religion verged on superstition . I think that Pierre cannot stand his father's passiveness . He needs an outlet : crucifying a frog or squashing a bird between two stones are first attempts at a murder . Hate , anger and frustration are in him and won't live him alone . One day animals are not enough : the saucy song ( which we can hear twice ) sung by the neighbor about his dad , it's this which sparks off the incident or should I say the tragedy . They are three dead bodies in the kitchen , lying in a pool of their blood . A boy is running across the country thinking " what have I done ? " and putting his trust in God , cause he gave his life in sacrifice so the others ( his father , his grandmother , his other brothers ) could survive . He still do not know whether he'll be sentenced to death when he's arrested , but he knows that he is dead anyway . This is a slow moving movie , not exactly an accessible one ; but it's a demanding one , and one that will reward you if you give it a chance .
583138	1219578	16232	9.0	From the silent era to the coming of the Nouvelle Vague . . . . .	. . . which was so hard on him , Duvivier reigned over the French cinema during 40 years . He made films in America , in England , in Italy , in Germany . Which director of the New Wavelet can say the same ? In Lille today , Duvivier's native town , there ' s no Duvivier street , no Duvivier school , no Duvivier hospital . Do they even mention his name when they teach cinema at the university ? . In Rouen , one metro station is called François TRuffaut and that director was not even born here . This is the silent version of Jules Renard's classic , seven years before the talkie featuring Harry Baur and Robert Lynen . Once again all we have to do is stand and applause . Renard's book , made of small vignettes , very short chapters , is very hard to transfer to the screen . As he would do in 1932 , Duvivier - who was also a writer - selected several scenes he particularly liked in the novel ( the hens , the little girl ) and wrote a linear screenplay . The storyline of the remake is more assured for the 1925 treatment includes a love affair between Felix and a bad gal ( not from the book ) which sometimes gets in the way . THis is minor quibble : " Poil de Carotte " is Duvivier at his best ; he ' s second to none when it comes to depicting nastiness , and Madame Lepic epitomizes nastiness . This terrifying mustached shrew surpasses the histrionic strident missus of the second version . If smile could kill , hers probably would . She looks like a man with a wig : Duvivier probably wanted to show the father's weakness , his impossibility to be a man . The young boy who portrays the miserable boy is as good as Robert Lynen . His face covered in freckles is so desperate , so touching : he is literally begging to be loved . The first time he's wanted to commit suicide , he gives up , because " it would sadden his friends " . . . . the dog and the cat . . . . The second time , those sinister lines appear on the screen , twice : the barn . . . . . the beam . . . . the rope . . . . As the precedent user , a Duvivier specialist has pointed out , there are plenty of technical innovations , probably inspired by former experiments by Abel Gance : the specter in the sky when the brat goes to the hen house ; four of five boys are working around L monsieur Lepic who realizes that his son has really got a raw deal ; the merry-go-round and Poil de Carotte's head . The fair , Duvivier already knew how to use it to startling effects : he would use it again , in an even more outstanding way in his 1945 masterpiece " Panique " . Too bad Duvivier did not treat the harrowing chapter " La Tempête des Feuilles " ( = the leaves storm ) . It would have fit a silent movie like a glove . Duvivier's legendary pessimism is present , although there's some kind of happy end ( Now there are two of us ) , the same as in the remake . A happy end when you know your mother will never give you any love . . . like Jules Renard's own mother . It was a true story . Like this ? try these : Luis Bunuel : " los Olvidados " ( 1950 ) Luigi Comencini : " incompreso " ( 1967 ) Maurice Pialat : " L'Enfance Nue " ( 1968 ) Dardenne bros : " Rosetta " ( 1999 )
583782	1219578	49366	9.0	shoestring budget , great results .	No stars , hardly 80 minutes , black and white , special effects kept to the minimum : and however , one of the most striking sci-fi movie you can think of . Don Siegel would make some of the modern directors blush , these directors who cannot do anything if there's not a ton of make-up and special effects to help them . An allegory , this story can be interpreted in different ways : some saw totalitarian system , and considering the era ( the fifties , when cold war was at his heights ) , they may be right . Fear does not stem from monsters or stuff like that , but from friendly faces that suddenly turn threatening . A kiss can scare you to death . It's the same world , but where smiles hide something definitely spooky . And Don Segel does not even allow himself a happy end . Perhaps the policemen at the end can do something , but perhaps it's too late , and anyway , are they really who they seemto be ? Remakes were made , with stars , with color , with enhanced special effects . No one comes close to the pristine 1956 version .
584495	1219578	52600	10.0	So little time to love , so much time to die .	" Ballada o soldate " has one of the most poignant sequences of all war movies : when the mother holds only for a few minutes , her dear boy in her arms , it's impossible to hold back your tears . I saw the movie for the first time thirty years ago and I have never forgotten it . Far from politics , " ballada o soldate " is an universal poem , enhanced by a magnificent grandiose score , which enhances the simple beauty of the pictures , climaxing on a symphony for the finale . Aliocha's furlough is so short ( 48 hours ) and it's such a long way to his dear home . His journey becomes an odyssey , but , unlike Ulysses , his happiness will be short-lived . He and the girl form one of the most touching , lovable and innocent couple you will see on a screen . Their simple joys , particularly when they share the soldier's food , or when they meet again in the desert station , are the ones which make a life worthwhile , even in the hell which surrounds them . Sometimes recalling Sirk's " a time to love and a time to die " ( 1958 ) from Erich Maria Remarque , the great German pacifist writer , with which it shares the same disgust of war ( " I wanted to film a subject which could condemn war " , the director said ) , " ballada o soldato " is one of these rare movies that will reward you each time you watch it .
583919	1219578	32811	10.0	Admirable	The last pictures of " three comrades " indicated that " they " were fighting in town " little man what now ? " had already depicted a society about to explode . " The mortal storm " concludes the tragedy . " The mortal storm " is the hard rain that's gonna fall . It is superior to the two aforementioned works which were nothing short of masterpieces though . Should they have awarded a director the Nobel prize of peace , Frank Borzage would have deserved it hands down . I cannot think of another artist of the era whose movies moves me to tears like him . Borzage's influence was strong on such directors as Minnelli ( 2nd version of " the four horsemen of the apocalypse " ) and Visconti ( " la Caduti Dei Degli " ) . But none of them can match Borzage when it comes to showing hope against hope , human warmth , friendly persuasion , and above all the greatness of man , the noble one and the humble one , the professor who refuses to give up the scientific truth to endorse the Nazi " theory " and the little schoolteacher who proclaims freedom of conscience , the student who remains true to his ideals and his heroic mother ( my favorite supporting part in the movie : Maria Ouspenskaya ) , the tender wife whose love for her non-Aryan husband proudly survives the terrifying brainwashing and the young girl who discovers that her fiancé has become an enemy . All these characters are so endearing we have the strange feeling we have known them for our whole life . Some will call it a propaganda movie . When a movie reaches such heights , the word becomes pejorative , and anyway all Borzage's movies I've seen are all propaganda movies , but in a very special way : they advocate peace , tolerance , justice , love , friendship , altruism . The pictures of the ominous sky , when the film begins , give the movie an universal meaning . And even if the director magnifies the greatness of man , he is not so naive : many of his heroes have to pay dearly for rebelling against fascism . Like Trumbo's " Johnny got his gun " , Abel Gance's " J'accuse " or Kubrik's " paths of glory " , a movie that should be studied in every school of the world .
585261	1219578	41634	10.0	Nothing is dirty when we love each other . . . . .	" Manon " might well be Clouzot's masterpiece , surpassing even " diabolique " " le salaire de la peur " or " le corbeau " . It's an adaptation of " l'histoire de Manon Lescault et du chevalier des Grieux " by L'Abbé Prévost , a novel from the XVIIIth century , but never mind . When HGC Clouzot takes a novel , he makes it his very own . He would do the same for detective story " celle qui n'était plus " which he completely rewrote for " les diaboliques " Clouzot's misanthropy has never been so omnipresent that in this opus . He became an outcast after the liberation in 1945 because of his " collaboration " - " le corbeau " was produced by a German firm-and one cannot help but think that his painting of the end of WW2 seems a settling of scores : the cropped women - they say it happened to the star of " le corbeau " Ginette Leclerc who had a lot of problems too - , the black market , the war profiteers , no one is spared in this wholesale massacre . Serge Regianni epitomizes the scumbag , in a part which sometimes recalls that of Carné's " les portes de la nuit " . But evil is not only inside him , it's everywhere : Clouzot's world is noir , noir , noir and leaves absolutely no hope to the audience . And however the way he films his lovers is stunning : on the ship , Manon under the pouring rain , trying to spend her last hours with Robert ; Manon , in the confessional , in a church in ruins , explaining to Robert she did not do any harm to anyone and that , had the American come first , she would not have played around with the Germans ; the first night of love where the lovers become shadows in the dark ; Robert finding Manon in a brothel ; Manon desperately searching for her lover in the overcrowded carriage ; and mainly mainly the extraordinary final scenes the romanticism of which surpassing even the frenzied passion of " Colorado territory " or " duel in the sun " . Actually , Clouzot's extravaganza is not unlike Von Stroheim's " greed " ' s madness . The male lead , Michel Auclair , is absolutely extraordinary : the last ten minutes are his and he ' s so moving that he carries these sequences in the desert single - handedly as much as he carries Manon ' s dead body . But Clouzot's directing will leave you on the edge of your seat as well : the long walk under a blistering sun , the cactuses which become ghosts from the past , Robert burying Manon in the sand and screaming that now she's his at last . Cécile Aubry ( debut ) portrays Manon . Seven years before Carroll Baker in " baby doll " , she is a femme enfant - much more than a femme fatale - . She's not evil , but she lives in a hostile world and she does not want to live like her mother , she needs luxury ; it's a sensitive character who feels remorse , pain and loves Robert dearly even when she cheats on him outrageously . Her good-natured sexuality and her absence of hypocrisy predates that of Brigitte Bardot by seven years too . Their problem is the world outside : that's why the key of the movie is the sequence in the oasis " why couldn't we stay here forever ? " Manon asks . As they leave this haven of peace - the only minutes of happiness in the whole movie " , Clouzot films their reflections in the cool clear water . And the fact that Manon and Robert are looking for a promise land in the desert in the company of Jews , what a symbol ! " paradise is too far away " she says . The rest of the cast features some of the best actors of the era : Serge Regianni , Manon's dirty brother ; Gabrielle Dorziat , a madam , screaming " quel bordel ! " ; Helena Manson , the nurse in " le corbeau " who wants to punish the whore who sleeps with the enemy ; and more and more and more . . Another permanent feature in Clouzot's work is the sordidness of the places : the crummy boarding-school of " les diaboliques " , the seedy apartments in " quai des orfèvres " , the poor hospital in " les espions " , and here the ship where they pack Jews on their way to Palestine , not to mention the desert with its animal skeletons - soon to be joined by those of the Jews-The action of this movie is remarkably dense , and its construction very subtle : the film begins with the illegal embarkation of the Jews , and then , at the least expected moment , the lovers appear for the first time and shortly afterwards tell the captain their sad story . Did French cinema need the nouvelle vague so bad when it had a genius like Clouzot ? " Manon " is an absolute must . N . B . 1 . Another modern " Manon " " Manon 70 " ( sic ) was made in the sixties with Catherine Deneuve , but it was laughable . 2 . Cécile Aubry's actress career was short-lived ; in the sixties , she moved into the - rather bland - serial for children , the likes of " Belle et Sebastien " featuring her own son ; she was very successful .
583715	1219578	35823	10.0	Patience and resignation / Impatience and rebellion .	SPOILERS SPOILERS " Douce " is one of the absolute peaks of the French cinema during the Occupation . Sixty years later , its strength is still intact , its beauty fascinating . Probably Claude Autant-Lara ' s masterpiece , it's a work every movie buff must see , particularly the ones who love Max Ophuls's or Joseph L . Mankiewicz's esthetic refinement . Quintet could be another name for it because it deals with five characters , played by five equally brilliant actors . Meet them : - the countess of Bonaffé : an old noble , who has not forgotten 1789 , and who wants to keep the world as it is : " do not give the Poor too beautiful things because they could dream of a luxury they will never be able to afford " . She reigns in her luxury home over her servants whom she despises and humiliates . Marguerite Moreno portrays this dowager with authority . - Her son , a wash-out widower , who lost a leg in the war of 1870 against the Prussians , a big defeat for France . And for the nobles , whose occupation has always been war , particularly before the 1789 revolution , it's ultimate decay . Disenchanted , he's secretely in love with his daughter Douce's teacher Irène . Jean Debucourt plays this aristocrat with bonhomie and a certain naiveté . - Her granddaughter , Douce : a romantic young girl . she's too young to understand . She's in love with the countess's ostler , Fabien . Odette Joyeux was one of Autant-Lara ' s favorite actresses . She will also star in " Sylvie et le fantôme " and " le mariage de chiffon " . - Douce's teacher , Irène . She was hired by the countess , recommended by Fabien , because she's his lover . Madeleine Robinson really shines and is probably the stand-out of a stellar cast . She literally mesmerizes the audience . - And finally , Fabien , loved at once by an aristocrat and a common . He's a rebel , he ' s got nothing but contempt for the countess and her world of privileges . It would take pages to depict all the richness of this work . The most famous scene remains " la visite aux pauvres " ( paying a visit to the Poor ) : the countess bringing a tiny Xmas tree-which contrasts with the huge one in her hall - and a pot - au - feu ( boiled beef with vegetables ) to a needy couple : " patience and resignation " she tells to " comfort " them . Behind her back , Fabien mumbles " impatience and rebellion " . The situation is a cul - de - sac : nothing is possible ; the father's love for the teacher is a misalliance the countess would never agree with . As for Douce , she tries to escape her stifling milieu : she leaves home with Fabien , but tragedy awaits round the corner . SPOILERSµµµµµµµµµSPOILERS The final pictures are astonishing : Irène and fabien are turned out by the countess on Xmas day ; while they leave the house , which represents a crumbling and crepuscular world , more than ever , now that Douce is dead in a fire , you can hear a heavenly carol . END of Spoiler . It would be a crime to pass over Philippe Agostini's cinematography , which enhances the muffled atmosphere of the candlelit mansion . Under this veneer , so many frustrations , so much wickedness , rottenness everywhere .
582830	1219578	41452	10.0	De Havilland's legacy . . . .	. . . to all young actresses who want to learn about their job : watch Mrs De Havilland whose performances are close to perfection ; an actress who did not think twice when it came to make herself look ugly . And the rest of the cast is admirable too : Monty Clift was perhaps the most gifted actor of his generation and sir Ralph Richardson is equally powerful as the selfish resentful father . How is it possible that there are still " critics " who despise William Wyler , maybe the best story teller of the whole American cinema ? His directing is BY NO MEANS academic . Nobody films a ball like Wyler used to do : everybody remembers the fabulous scenes in " Wuthering Heights " , " the letter " and of course " Jezebel " . Here he outdoes himself and his filming of these people dancing is a feast for the eye . I also love the way Wyler introduces his male lead . Besides , Clift is so subtle an actor he makes us believe he might not be a fortune-hunter . Another stroke of genius is the use of the stairs . All along the movie , Catherine goes downstairs then upstairs , till the impressive final sequence . The cast and credits appear on a tapestry which become a picture of the street . A tapestry Catherine will be making during the whole movie too . It represents an ossified society where time stood still . Catherine on her stairs is like a squirrel in a cage . A remake , called " Washington square " , was made by A . Holland starring Jennifer Jason-Leigh , Albert Finney , Maggie Smith and Ben Chaplin . Although it cannot hold a candle to the 1949 version , it's worth a watch though .
583986	1219578	434166	10.0	Let there be light !	Is there anyone more important in the history of cinema than the Lumière bros ? If there is , I want to know his name right now ! Without them . . . . The pictures are all by Louis Lumière , the editing by Marc Allégret who made pleasant films , although not as exciting as those of his brother Yves . Marc Allégret was born in 1900 at a time when the cinema was still a new born child . . . . or a marvelous toy , a magic eye , or should I say a time machine . . A time machine is the right word : thanks to Louis Lumière we can see Paris as it was at the end of the nineteenth century . Although the cinema was reportedly born in 1895 , some of their movies were made the year before . The film begins with a biography of the Lumière family , but from 1894-5 onwards , their life ( actually Louis's ) and their work merge . The first shorts ( " Le Dejeuner de Bébé " ) revolved around family life . Louis Lumière did not think that his invention would last and he wanted to capitalize on it . It's often said that it took Melies to make the cinema a show , but Lumiere had already felt that it could " tell stories " : " L'Arroseur Arrosé " and " La Concierge " ( a female part played by a man ) . . But more than these anecdotes , the real meat lies in Louis's news movies . At a time people did not travel , this was a fantastic new way to see the world : Lumière began to film everywhere : in England , in Austria , in America ( where he was carried in triumph ) , in Russia . One must remember that at the time , Russia was France's ally ; some may call these films propaganda but we are taken to the coronation of Nicholas the Second and we attend his visit to president Emile Loubet at the beginning of his reign . The voice over insists on the quality of the pictures , which were influenced by the painters : there are " colors " in the blacksmiths segment and there is plenty of relief everywhere . Lumiere was capable , for a period of years , of ceaseless change : moving from his garden to the whole world , taking his movie camera everywhere , on a moving train or in the elevator of the Eiffel tower ( which predates Clair's technique in " Paris Qui Dort " ) . He invented the tracking and the editing . This movie is really a time machine ! It's well worth your time !
582388	1219578	53291	10.0	Some like the fanfares d'amour hot .	In the thirties , Billy Wilder used to work in France , where he made his first film " mauvaise graine " , with Danielle Darrieux in 1934 . The following year , Richard Pottier made his " fanfare d'amour " . So Wilder probably heard about it . Here's a short summary of " fanfare d'amour " : Two comedians in dire straits , Jean and Pierre are chasing after any sort of work . This year , female combos are trendy . So they dress up as women and become part of " Dutch tulips " and all-women orchestra . Everybody take the night train . Jean and Pierre fall in love with Gaby and become rivals . But the girl has met Jean ( in a man's clothes ! ) and she's crazy about him . Besides the theater director ( a man ! ) falls also in love with Jean whom he mistakes for a woman ! There's no coincidence ; there are too many similarities between the 1935 " fanfare d'amour " and 1959 " some like it hot " . The former is impossible to see even in FRance where the telly never broadcasts it . Anyway , Wilder wins hands down : Richard Pottier was a moderately talented director , the American director a genius . Almost fifty years later , " some like it hot " remains my all-time favorite comedy . And as this not avowed remake does not need a third one , because I could hardly imagine someone doing a better work than Wilder . Nobody's perfect , but at his best he was .
582770	1219578	25408	10.0	We are all little men ( and women ) .	Peace and tolerance are the hero's favorite words . " Little man what now " was the first part of the trilogy which encompassed " three comrades " and would culminate in " the mortal storm " . The three movies featured the same star ( Margaret Sullavan ) and depicted life in Germany before WW2 . " Little man " - although Hitler came to power in January 1933 - , like " Three comrades " , remains vague as far politics are concerned . But we feel while the heroes pace up up and down the street that there's something in the air ( the first pictures ) . In " three comrades " , the ending in the graveyard tells us that " they " are in town . And " the mortal storm " connects all the links and is the absolute masterpiece Borzage always threatened to make . " Little man " is an overwhelming movie . Lammchen and Hans believe in love , tolerance and peace and the world they live in is harshness , selfishness , corruption and contempt . Hans's longing for human warmth is harrowing in the scene with the nurse . With an exception , when Hans is looking for job , he meets people who enjoy humiliating and demeaning their fellow men . " Little man " is full of strong scenes : the stroll in the country where the outside world ( the hateful Kleinholz ) will not leave the heroes alone ; the actor who wants to play the part of a guy who " lives in the wrong side of the town " but who does not show any compassion when he meets one of those guys . Margaret Sullavan on the carousel , confessing she ate all the salmon she bought ; on a bench in the park feeding the pigeons . Both Hans and Lammchen display the same naiveté : she really did know that near the pigeons , there were a man and his wife who were starving . Hans did not know either that his stepmother's parties were very bad things . When the movie ends , there's another little man who , says Lammchen , will be by your side and help you cope with your struggle . Watching " little man " ( or any of Borzage's movies ) helps you being a better human being .

' s three final gigs of the Monster tour in November 1995 in Atlanta , Georgia , the band's native state . A very testing trek punctuated with serious incidents like the drummer Bill Berry's aneurysm in Lausanne , Switzerland or the bassist Mike Mills ' intestinal tumor after a concert in Köln , Germany . But Michael Stipe's great band overcame these dramas and overall , the tour was a big financial success . When the band landed in Atlanta , they were in excellent mood and " Roadmovie " is a valuable witness of their state of mind . Mike Mills seemed to be on top form these nights . Although Michael Stipe isn't here at his most talkative , " Roadmovie " also stands as an eloquent witness of the concerts the band gave during the Monster tour with the screening of films and photos behind the stage , Michael Stipe in a Kurt Cobain style due to his glasses , at least for the beginning of the film , Mike Mills in a glittering costume and the order of the songs for most of these nights . As for the set , the usual suspects are here : " Losing my Religion " , " Man on the Moon " , " Everybody Hurts " or " What's the Frequency Kenneth ? " keep the audience overjoyed with new songs to boot at the time which were to find their places in " New Adventures in Hi-Fi " ( 1996 ) : " the Wake-Up Bomb " or " Undertow " . My favorite moment was " Let Me In " practically filmed in static shot that gave the performance a harrowing feel . Stipe dedicated this song to Kurt Cobain and Mills plays this swirling guitar part with a guitar that once belonged to the Nirvana front man . If you stand in awe for R . E . M . , this is a must-have in your collection . You can forgive the sometimes flashy effects for some fast songs like " Star 69 " and enjoy the rest . The end of their world as we knew it ? It was highly likely to arrive in 1997 with Bill Berry's departure but now , let's hope that it will be delayed as soon as possible .
