395874	2483625	96149	1.0	There was a mutiny at the drive-in when this was shown	On it's own Space Mutiny is bad enough , but I unfortunately saw it immediately after viewing the latest Star Wars endeavor from George Lucas so I got to compare it to a really good science fiction film . Poor Cameron Mitchell and John Philip Law respected actors that they are handled things differently . Mitchell just looked like he was about to throw up , I think that's why they gave him that obviously fake Santa Claus beard , to try to hide his discomfort . Now Law , just overacts outrageously as Kalgan , the leader of a mutiny aboard a futuristic Babylon Five . His dastardly plan is to take over and sell the people on board into slavery with some space pirates he deals with . During the course of the movie he borrows from Sir Laurence Olivier torturing Dustin Hoffman in Marathon Man . The hero and heroine Reb Brown and Cassandra Cissie will never be confused with Lord Oliver and Vivien Leigh . In fact old Reb ain't as good an actor as the Governator of Calleefornia . But he does look attractive enough in his sleeveless undershirt which he wears throughout most of the film . One scene that totally cracked me up was Brown and Law battling it out with those futuristic bumper carts . But it ain't enough reason to see this film or buy the video .
396661	2483625	910936	2.0	A Couple Of Stoners Turn Rambo	Don't look for anything to terribly sophisticated in Pineapple Express . In fact the nuggets of humor to be mined here are few and far between . Maybe I'm old fashioned , but the notion of a minor league drug dealer and his number one customer as heroes is just a bit bizarre for my taste . But that's what happens when Seth Rogen after making a purchase of some really primo grass called Pineapple Express , just fresh on the market , he sees a murder committed by a big drug lord , Gary Cole and his girlfriend , policewoman Rosie Perez . That telltale roach he left behind leads Cole and Perez to dealer James Franco and they spend the rest of the film running for their lives . Until the very end when they turn Rambo and all the drug traffickers in two gangs get dealt with severely . And I certainly don't see anything remotely humorous in these two lugnuts looking for traveling money , selling some of this really good marijuana to school kids . But what do I know and I reached maturity in the Sixties .
396851	2483625	112817	3.0	Finding Meaning In The Obscure	Well maybe I'm just a Philistine but I certainly have to dissent from all the rave reviews this film has gotten . It happens I like my westerns traditional , John Ford , Howard Hawks , Delmar Daves , Burt Kennedy , those guys make westerns . Jim Jarmusch makes weird . So does Johnny Depp who I salute for having the artistic courage to play an incredible variety of roles . I love what he did in Edward Scissorhands , Nick of Time , and in the Pirates of the Caribbean series . But he came up short in playing William Blake , the guy who is not the famous English poet . This William Blake travels west spending every dime he has on a promise of a job keeping books for a metal works company owned by Robert Mitchum . When he arrives late , he's told the job is filled . He casually drifts into a relationship with a woman and wouldn't you know it , she's the gal pal of Gabriel Byrne , Mitchum's son . Byrne comes in guns blazing and catches Depp and his woman en flagrato . He shoots the woman and Depp shoots him in self defense . No matter , Mitchum's the big he bull of the area and a bounty goes on Depp's head . In the words of that immortal 20th Century philosopher Joe Louis , he can run but he can't hide . Not even with the help of a new found Indian friend in Gary Farmer . A lot of reviewers extracted meaning from obscure things in this film which wanders rather aimlessly with Depp's fugitive status . I extracted nothing , but boredom . But Dead Man might be your cup of tea , it certainly isn't mine .
393501	2483625	43828	3.0	Just what did Ava's Grandma do that was so terrible ?	My Forbidden Past has Ava Gardner as decadent New Orleans belle living with her great aunt Lucile Watson and her cousin Melvyn Douglas . She's got a yen for Yankee doctor Robert Mitchum who is doing research over at Tulane University . They break things off and Mitchum goes away and returns with a bride , slatternly Janis Carter . In the meantime Ava inherits a whole bunch of money from her grandmother who left New Orleans years ago under a cloud . Just what she did is never revealed , but her name is spoken in hushed tones . Whatever she did , she sure got rich at it . It kind of reminds me of The Road to Rio where we never do find out what those papers were that foiled the dastardly schemes of Gale Sondergaard to marry off Dorothy Lamour . As Bing concludes about the " papers " the world must never know . This film was conceived so that Howard Hughes who was crushing out on Ava Gardner big time at that point could get her over to RKO . He paid Louis B . Mayer's price and Mayer apparently threw in Melvyn Douglas . Melvyn Douglas knows full well what a clinker this is so he overacts outrageously in the best Snidely Whiplash tradition of screen villains . He's the best one in the film . My Forbidden Past should come with a warning label that if you manage to sit through this melodrama because you want to find out just what Ava's forbidden past was with grandma , you will be left hanging .
394783	2483625	70653	3.0	What Was The Point Of All This ?	Scorpio was a film Burt Lancaster didn't think too much of according to a recent biography and after viewing it I can certainly see why . On the plus side Lancaster got to work with former co-stars Alain Delon from The Leopard and with Paul Scofield from The Train , both films considerably better than Scorpio . Too bad he wasn't given something better than a warmed over espionage story . Lancaster is a CIA agent suspected of being a double agent . Word has come from on high to terminate his existence . Not an easy task by any means . Lancaster hasn't survived in the spy business by being a dummy for thirty years . From French intelligence the CIA borrows hit-man Alain Delon who has worked and trained with Lancaster . He's got the title role as one nicknamed Scorpio because of the way he strikes . Lancaster has an ace or two up his sleeve also . An old friend with the KGB , Paul Scofield , is willing to help up to a point . Here's where there is a real problem . Both Lancaster and Scofield are identified by the script as having served in Loyalist Spain with ' volunteer ' groups . Of course in the Soviet case I'm sure volunteering was strongly urged . In America however that would have been the Abraham Lincoln Brigade . And during the post World War II McCarthy era that was one of a group of organizations past and present that was considered a Communist front . I'm sorry , but there ain't NO WAY that Lancaster with that in his background would have ever gotten a job with the Central Intelligence Agency . And if he did , he would have been found out and dismissed back then and there . The whole story falls apart knowing this . There are some nice location shots of Vienna and of Washington , DC in Scorpio and acting honors if any go to Paul Scofield . But the film is one colossal waste of time .
394382	2483625	61144	3.0	Another Rebel Who Doesn't Believe In Surrenders	Like Ethan Edwards in that much better western The Searchers , Joseph Cotten's Temple Cordeen doesn't believe in surrendering . He's taken no notice of the surrender at Appomattox and in fact when we first meet him , he's hanging a Yankee journalist who had the temerity to tell the black people on Cotten's Texas ranch they weren't slaves any more . At the same time his oldest son Gordon Scott comes home just in time to see the lynching and he's appalled by what dear old dad has done . This is how The Tramplers begins . Joseph Cotten before the Civil War was the local Ben Cartwright in his corner of Texas with five sons , two daughters and a host of other relatives . But by the end of the war , he and most of his family are acting more like the Clantons . Scott and youngest brother James Mitchum are against the father along with their two sisters . The three middle boys , three really putrid specimens of humanity stick with Cotten . Elements of The Searchers , The Texans , Saddle The Wind , and The Westerner are to be found in The Tramplers . I'm sure that Scott , one of the people who played Tarzan , Cotten , and Jim Mitchum , took their European vacation and their paychecks and said their lines and made sure the checks cleared the bank before saying them . I'm not a fan of European westerns and The Tramplers is not a film to convince me to be one .
396135	2483625	43542	3.0	Jeff Chandler wins the Maureen O'Hara handicap	Back in the 1940s Universal studios big star was Maria Montez who hit a gold mine in those Arabian sand and sandal epics with Jon Hall and Sabu . A whole set was built for her and her films . Now boss Carl Laemmle at Universal was always practical and why waste those sets . So Universal made a whole lot of those films for its post war pin up boys , Tony Curtis , Rock Hudson , and Jeff Chandler . But this was one of the worst of them . Of course the obvious flaw is Maureen O'Hara as the Red-headed Arab princess . Ms . O'Hara was great when she was cast right , but here , she looks ridiculous and she knows it . The plot such as it is involves Jeff Chandler as a Bedouin chief who has one aim , to capture the Black Stallion , Shozada . Along the way he develops a yen for Maureen . Well who wouldn't , redheads being such a premium out there in the Tunisian desert . Maureen wants the horse too . She wants it so she can win the annual horse race and not have to marry one of the two Corsair Brothers , Lon Chaney , Jr . and Buddy Baer . Yoikes , what a choice . So hero and heroine find a commonality of interest in the horse and each other . I've often wondered what Jeff Chandler , who's real name was Ira Grossel , and who took being Jewish very seriously thought about playing an Arab . Remember this is post the Israeli war of independence and Chandler was a noted Zionist . He didn't look thrilled to be in this picture either . Was it politics or was it because it was such a stinkeroo .
395256	2483625	26432	3.0	Small Town School Marm	May Robson , two years after her Academy Award nominated performance in Lady for a Day , got roped into doing this film about a school principal in small town USA . The premise is actually an interesting one and you can follow the concept from a film like Grand Old Girl right up to a television series like Boston Public . She's a school principal 24 hours a day and takes an interest in all that goes on in her small town . The problem was that the script just had so many saccharine characters in it who in the end don't really turn out to be as bad as they first seem that it gets ridiculous . Alan Hale who runs a malt shop , but who has a back room where gambling and liquor are available to the kids , is one of her foes . In the end however he feels sorry for the old gal and turns out to be her rescuer . This is after she attempted to run him out of business . Mary Carlisle in the next generation would be labeled a high school hellcat . At first she is one spoiled rich kid tramp and then she breaks down and cry when the town fathers led by her father put Robson out to pasture . Among Robson's former pupils is a man who became an unnamed mythical President of the United States who makes a dramatic appearance in his home town . It can't be FDR since the president's face is never shown . Sort of like how Jesus was portrayed in films like The Big Fisherman or Ben-Hur later . Also the president is walking unaided which FDR could not do . But Gavin Gordon who plays the president has an FDR like mellifluous voice . Fred MacMurray here is wasted , none of his gifts of comedy are utilized and that's a shame . He's a delivery man who Carlisle has a yen for . Cecil B . DeMille made a controversial film two years earlier called This Day and Age about high school kids fighting corruption in their small town . Some of the same elements are here in Grand Old Girl , but the scriptwriters I believe were trapped by the persistent mythology of small town America and the good people in it . So the film got watered down to nothingness . Sad to say , but there's nothing of any real interest in Grand Old Girl .
393719	2483625	78801	3.0	Actors Boredom Transferred To The Audience	If Ashanti had been a serious attempt at a film about the institution of slavery , still prevalent in third world countries the film might have been better received . Instead it turns into a star studded disaster of a movie where the stars came in , said their lines , and picked up their paychecks without much conviction . Michael Caine and his wife Beverly Johnson work for the United Nations World Health Organization and are busy doing their humanitarian thing in East Africa . Along comes Peter Ustinov who can barely summon enough ham in him to make a go of the part as a Moslem slave dealer . As Johnson is black he grabs her anyway along with a lot of children and a few adults as well . Of course Caine doesn't take kindly to the kidnapping and the rest of the film is spent in a rescue attempt . The rest of the cast has such folks as William Holden , Rex Harrison , Omar Sharif and Indian film star Kebir Bedi in parts and looking so incredibly bored with the whole thing . Usually in something like this talented people like those mentioned above will just overact outrageously and feast on a diet of scenery . But Ashanti doesn't even have that going for it . What an incredible waste of time . The aroma of tax write off is permeating the air .
396030	2483625	78740	3.0	If Not For The Courage Of The Fearless Crew , The Concorde Would Be Lost	The real star of the last of the Airport films is that big supersonic carrier the French created called The Concorde . If you bear in mind that the whole film is dedicated to showing what that needle nosed plane could do in the sky , than the whole film kind of makes sense . But if you're expecting some serious drama here , than by all means take some of the evasive action the Concorde shows here when some nasty folks try to shoot her down . Susan Blakely plays a television news reporter who also happens to be the mistress of military industrial tycoon Robert Wagner . One of Wagner's aides just happens to bring her information on some of Wagner's dirty business dealings , selling arms to folks not friendly to the USA . When the source , Macon McCalman , is killed in front of her and she's nearly done in by a hit-man whom she escapes from of course she confronts Wagner with the information . And of course he denies it . But right before Blakely boards The Concorde , McCalman's widow Kathleen Maguire hands her the necessary documents . But on the way to Moscow with a stop in Paris , Wagner and his minions try to put the big bird down . But the fearless crew of Alain Delon , David Warner , and George Kennedy is up to all their tricks . It's quite a bag full as you'll see if you want to watch the film . If you're an aviation enthusiast , you absolutely won't care about the plot . It's like the film Le Mans with Steve McQueen which has a legion of auto racing fans who have made it a cult item . Maybe Le Mans is better at that because they just didn't bother with any kind of story . Among the passengers is a pot smoking saxophonist played by Jimmie Walker , a distraught mother accompanying a new heart for her child , played by Cicely Tyson and Martha Raye a woman with a weak bladder who spends the entire trip from Washington to Paris in the loo . She's actually the best one here . Robert Wagner must have been psychic though because I'm sure on the strength of this film he got the part of Doctor Evil's number two in the Austin Powers series . I'm sure all concerned got a big pay day out of this film , but it seems to have killed the Airport saga of movies .
393465	2483625	52601	4.0	Vic Phoned This One In	Victor Mature was always fond of telling people how bored he was in the acting profession and pretty soon he'd be out of it for the most part . He was at his most bored making The Bandit Of Zhobe an Indian Northwestern set on the real Indian frontier . He sleepwalks through this part , probably worried his paycheck wouldn't clear . Back in the day tales of the British army defending those outer reaches of the Empire on which the sun never set were as popular with British kids as the dime novels written about the exploits of our frontier characters out west . The Bandit Of Zhobe plays like one of those westerns . The evil Walter Gotell wants to get the frontier ablaze and what better way to do it than get the British army fighting with a neighboring native leader . Gotell has his guys attacking the British army and also has his guys in British army Sepoy uniforms go into Mature's town and massacre the place , killing his wife and child . I've seen this plot premise in many of our own westerns . Taking on the task of bringing everyone together is Anne Aubrey , daughter of British Colonel Norman Wooland . A little bit of Rudolph Valentino's The Sheik is thrown in here with Aubrey's obvious attraction for Mature even though he's been doing terrible things to her people after he's been set on the warpath . Best in the film without a doubt is Anthony Newley as the corporal and bodyguard of Aubrey . He proves to be quite resourceful and has the best lines the script . The final battle between Gotell's people and the British army is also well staged . But we've seen all of it before in many an American western .
396450	2483625	60801	4.0	Hate Me Glow	If anyone follows my reviews one will note that I always use the expression hero / heel when talking about Tyrone Power . He could be a full blooded hero or he was a hero / heel , a likable sort of guy , but one who was ruthless in getting what he wanted . You need someone of Power's ability and charm to play such a part . And sad to say that was something Stephen Boyd just doesn't bring to The Oscar . Even when one is an anti-hero there has to be certain qualities brought out that make you root for the guy . Two minutes into watching The Oscar and I wanted to punch out Stephen Boyd . This guy is all heel with no charm and uses people like toilet paper . Joseph E . Levine assembled quite a cast to support Boyd and I don't think I've ever seen so much talent squandered on such a mediocre picture . Try counting the number of Oscar winners in it . Just Edith Head's Oscars and she plays herself in the film must bring the total to over 20 . She got a nomination here for costume design , one of two The Oscar got , the second was for Art & Set design . Tony Bennett is the hero's best friend who is similarly used and abused doesn't give a half bad performance and this was to be a breakthrough for him as a dramatic actor like Bing Crosby or Frank Sinatra . I also liked Milton Berle as his agent . Some of the women in Boyd's life in this film are Eleanor Parker , Elke Sommer , and Jill St . John . The one I liked best was Jean Hale as a star who the up and coming Boyd is sent on a publicity date with . She's a female version of him so there is one great moment where she gets dumped on literally . One woman who was in Stephen Boyd's life and who always tried to promote his career in her column appears her as herself in one of her last appearances . Rumor has it that Boyd made old Hedda Hopper's life particularly memorable in her golden years . In the old My Favorite Martian series there was an episode where Ray Walston uses a special light bulb in the room and it gives off a benevolence bulb . You just become inexplicably likable to all around . Bill Bixby sees this as a great way to score with women and he uses it . But Walston tells him that on earthlings it gives you a hate me glow and the two spend the rest of the episode trying to find the antidote . That's what Boyd projected here , a two hour hate me glow . And in fact this review is dedicated to an attorney I knew back in Brooklyn , a man who had ambitions for a great political career , but had a hate me glow that made Boyd look like Albert Schweitzer . No names of course , but Ronald J . D'Angelo this film is for you . The Oscar is a campy all star look at an ambitious actor and if you can stand the hate me glow that Boyd projects , you'll like looking at the stars .
393471	2483625	140594	4.0	I Miss Walter Matthau	Keeping up with the times this 1998 remake of The Taking Of Pelham One Two Three had to change certain things and deliberately changed others . One indisputable fact was that in 1998 the New York City Transit Police had ceased being a separate entity and was now just part of the NYPD . Hence Walter Matthau's character as a Transit Cop would not have existed any longer . For this version Edward James Olmos is not only a regular NYPD detective , but he's a hostage negotiator specialist . The change out the Transit Police was necessary , but part of what made the first version work so well was Walter Matthau being placed in a situation he wouldn't normally be dealing with . In that version in fact he's shepherding a bunch of Japanese railroad people around the Transit Authority Command Center when the hijacking occurs . Instead of Jerry Stiller as his partner , Olmos is paired with Lorraine Bracco , certainly women by that time were doing more than administrative work in the NYPD . The mysterious head of the four hijackers is Vincent Donofrio on the other side of the law . We don't know who he is , but he certainly didn't have the air of mystery that soldier of fortune Robert Shaw did in the Seventies . In fact we never really find out anything about Donofrio . The plot follows pretty much the story in the original version . Since it was shot in Toronto , the streets of New York where a lot of the excitement above ground as the City tries to meet the hijackers deadline is missing from this version . Seeing Donofrio and Olmos makes me wish for Matthau and Shaw . Maybe the new version that will have Denzel Washington and John Travolta as antagonists will be better .
396203	2483625	35553	4.0	I Am Tondelayo , the baddest girl in the East .	Everyone in this movie is overacting , even Hedy Lamarr if that's possible for her . One of the campiest , most unintentionally hilarious things ever put on screen . The plot briefly is Walter Pidgeon is both head of a rubber plantation and magistrate of a colonial area , presumably under British possession . He's getting rid of one assistant and a new one is coming on the plantation . The biggest problem in the district is not disease , heat , jungle animals or natives who don't want to be slaves . It's Tondelayo a mixed racial native woman in tight dresses who gets everybody's mojo working overtime . She's working in her own way to relieve the white man of his burdens . And now she's got her eye on Richard Carlson , Pidgeon's new assistant . Pidgeon's insistence that Carlson not get involved with Lamarr amounts to an obsession . The rest of this story has to be seen to be believed . Hedy Lamarr was an extraordinarily beautiful and sexy woman and that made up for the fact she was not a good actress . But she could give a good performance in a great while with proper guidance . But she didn't get it here . Cecil B . DeMille , no player's director did better for her in Samson and Delilah . Walter Pidgeon , Henry O'Neill , Frank Morgan , Richard Carlson , and Bramwell Fletcher are all gifted performers . They all look embarrassed to be there so they just overact the dickens out of this script . All and all it makes for hilarious viewing .
395540	2483625	95854	4.0	Far Fetched Set Of Circumstances	Perry Mason : The Case of the Avenging Ace is one of the more far fetched episodes where the murderer and the individual behind the murders will do anything , kill anybody to keep a particular family scandal from seeing the light of day . If you remember in Perry Mason Returns , Raymond Burr was an appellate judge who resigned the bench to defend Della Street from a murder charge . This film begins with a flashback to those times on the bench where he votes to sustain a conviction for murder on procedural grounds of Larry Wilcox , a decorated Air Force colonel who allegedly murdered a woman he was allegedly involved with . Fast forward to the present when a witness has come forward who on the day of the hearing reneges on his testimony under threat . Then Wilcox is busted out of jail and later the recanting witness is shot to death and Wilcox is found with murder weapon in hand . This far fetched set of circumstances would defeat any lesser lawyer , but we're dealing with Perry Mason . You know this top gun will eventually be free of all charges , including the original murder that sent him up . This particular Mason film I found a bit too bizarre for my taste , but fans of the series will love it .
395442	2483625	36166	4.0	FDR's Man In The Kremlin	One of the most controversial films ever made , Mission To Moscow was not good for anyone's career who got involved with the making . Like Song Of Russia made over at MGM , Mission To Moscow was a film made specifically to improve Soviet-American relations in facing the common enemy they had . The Soviet Union no matter how much the American Communist Party trumpeted their virtues , still had a real image problem in a lot of quarters due to the purges that Joseph Stalin conducted , due to the tremendous dislocation his five year plans created , due to the misery caused by the collectivization of agriculture and the systematic slaughter of Kulaks . Kulaks roughly translated could be anyone who owned a large estate to someone who might own a slightly bigger piece of land and maybe some farm animals . Stalin slaughtered thousands of them to force collectivization . Our first ambassador to the Soviet Union was William C . Bullitt who was sent there in 1933 . The Republican post World War I presidents did not diplomatically recognize the Soviet Union , Franklin Roosevelt's first foreign policy initiative was to extend recognition . Bullitt was a guy at first enthused , but then got very disillusioned by what he saw . He and FDR had a falling out and he left Moscow in 1936 . Joseph E . Davies was an industrialist and large Democratic contributor who did go back with FDR to the Wilson administration . He was appointed US Ambassador and after that became a cheerleader for the Soviets . As is shown in the film , Davies just blindly accepted every piece of propaganda handed to him . Films made in 1943 were not going to cast a critical light on the dark underside of Communist Russia . Walter Huston dusts off his Sam Dodsworth persona to play Ambassador Davies . Ann Harding plays his dutiful wife and Eleanor Parker their daughter . Vladimir Sokoloff is President Kalinin , Gene Lockhart plays Prime Minister Molotov and Oscar Homolka plays Foreign Minister Litvinov all well known personalities of the day . In the Soviet Union like other countries Davies would have been required to present his credentials to the president and Russia did have a figurehead president who was a great deal less than Mission To Moscow makes him out . At that time Joseph Stalin was only the Secretary of the Presidium of the Communist Party , but as such wielded the real power . The People's Republic of China adopted a similar set up that never changed with Mao Tse-tung as Party head and holding the real power while Mao lived . Stalin is played by actor Manart Kippen and is only seen once as Davies is prepared to leave the Russian embassy . He's so shy and retiring the portrayal is so absolutely ludicrous that it leaves me laughing . But Davies sitting through the purge trials and accepting without question all the testimonies and forced confessions is also ludicrous . After his time was up as Ambassador , Davies wrote the book on which this film was based and did go on a speaking tour promoting Russo-American cooperation . He was doing this on behalf of his friend and president FDR , but Davies had also become a real true believer in the ' miracle ' that was Soviet Russia . When the Cold War started three films became the targets of the House Un American Activities Committee , they were ripe targets that the conservative members were grateful for . The three films were The North Star from 20th Century Fox , Song Of Russia from MGM , and Mission To Moscow . None got more criticism than this one . Screenwriter Howard Koch who had won an Oscar this same year for Casablanca , earned a place on the blacklist because of Mission To Moscow . Whatever Koch's personal political convictions were , in this case all he did was translate to the screen what was in Davies's book . Davies was held up to ridicule and in some measure deserved a bit of it because of Mission To Moscow . Time and the end of the Cold War have given us a proper perspective of the Russian contribution towards defeating the Nazis . In fact it was the lion's share in Europe . Policy decisions were made on the basis of keeping the Russians in the war before the Americans and British and respective allies got on the European continent with forces to make it a two front war , first in Italy and then in France . There was a justifiable fear that Stalin would make a separate peace with Hitler just as he signed the non-aggression pact with him before World War II started in 1939 . Of course the reports that Davies wrote off about the brutality of the Soviet Union were also true . The reactionaries had a field day with him , he was never taken seriously again . For that reason Mission To Moscow has not worn well either as history or entertainment .
395328	2483625	105608	4.0	The Mission , Kill Crooked Cops	To Protect And Serve is the motto of Police Departments across the USA and in this case the title of a film starring C . Thomas Howell who finds himself among a lot of crooked cops . True to the blue wall of silence , Tom backs up this crew when they beat a suspect to death in their custody . He becomes part of the crew and earns their trust . Months later somebody on a mission is doing a very nice job of killing all of this bunch who had a hand in the beating . Are they going to get to Tom next ? Will his new partner and former lover , Lezlie Deane , get in the way when it all hits the fan ? This was one of those straight to video film releases that film distributors decided at the last minute wasn't marketable for the big screen . That's a pity because this film did have the potentiality to be something better . Even with all the holes in the plot , if someone like Clint Eastwood had starred , it would have gone to the big screen . C . Thomas Howell is also listed as an associate producer . Had I been Tom I'd have paid more attention to the script because Tom does give a good performance . Standing out in the supporting cast is Zoe Trilling as a working girl who is a potential witness to the cop serial killer .
396124	2483625	59431	4.0	Marriage Sank Without A Trace	The only reason this film gets as high as four is for all the talent involved . If Frank and Dean had sung in this film it might have rated higher . But the plain fact is that Marriage on the Rocks just ain't that funny . Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin are best friends and partners in an advertising agency . Sinatra is married to Deborah Kerr with two kids and a mother-in-law in the house . Dino is a carefree bachelor and all around swinger and boozer . Basically these two really play themselves so there's no great stretch of any thespian talent . Through an odd combination of circumstances , Sinatra and Kerr whose marriage is going through a rough patch go to Mexico on a second honeymoon and through the machinations of divorce attorney Cesar Romero they get an instant Mexican divorce . Then when Sinatra can't make it back to Mexico , he sends Dino back to pick up Kerr and offer an explanation and Martin winds up married to Kerr . Now their roles are reversed and Martin is now a stepfather to Nancy Sinatra and Michael Petit and Sinatra's having a whale of a good time leading a swinging , ring-a-ding life . Of course all gets righted in the end . We've seen it all before from Frank and Dean . This would be their last joint film appearance for 17 years until Cannonball Run II . Mainly because of the critical roasting this film got . Both of them just walk through the parts here . Dean Martin was just starting his highly successful television series which would be his main venue for the next decade and Frank was doing some very nice television specials around that time . It would have been nice if both of them had sang some more on the big screen , but no more movie singing for them , except for Dino in the first Matt Helm film . In any event the Rat Pack was breaking up as the two of them plus Peter Lawford , Sammy Davis , Jr . and Joey Bishop all started doing their own thing more and more . Deborah Kerr looks like she's wondering how she got there with the boys , she certainly doesn't have the right spirit to be a Rat Pack broad like Shirley MacLaine or Angie Dickinson or Barbara Rush . In fact Marriage on the Rocks is one colossal waste of an incredible assembly of talented players .
396340	2483625	26523	5.0	The Lady In Red - - - - - - - - What a Personality ?	Pat O'Brien , part time critic and full time boozer , gets pulled away to Caliente in Mexico by his friend Edward Everett Horton to avoid getting married to gold digger Glenda Farrell . But it's out of the frying pan into the fire . Dolores Del Rio has a Spanish dancing act that O'Brien savagely panned one night after attending her performance stewed to the gills . That hurt her career and when she sees him on her home turf , she's going to get a little vengeance . She and father / manager Leo Carrillo . Of course if you can't figure out where this plot is going by now , you haven't seen too many old films . But the plot is just an excuse to string together four Busby Berkeley numbers , including the big hit that came out of the film , The Lady in Red . Dolores Del Rio , what a beauty she was . Hard to believe anyone could have panned her dancing . She sang beautifully as well . When she got her first big break in American cinema in the silent version of Ramona , she recorded the title song and even though the screen was silent , her record sold quite a bit , such was the allure she conveyed . Of course Pat O'Brien was his usual fast talking promoter , though slowed down a bit due to hangover . He didn't contribute anything musical here , but he's always a pleasure to watch . Phil Regan did some vocalizing including the elaborate Muchacha finale number . The DeMarcos danced , Wini Shaw sang , and Judy Canova in her screen debut reprised a hillbilly version of The Lady In Red to a flustered Edward Everett Horton . It was quite a funny moment . In Caliente is not the best of the Busby Berkeley Warner Brothers musicals , but it's still good entertainment .
393650	2483625	43673	5.0	Drought On The Range	In Old Amarillo finds Roy Rogers working for cattle baron Pierre Watkin as a range detective investigating a drought that is plaguing all the ranches in the Amarillo area . The foreman of the Watkin ranch , Roy Barcroft , has got a few schemes of his own to take advantage of the drought and clean up in a bad cattle market . Why the film is called In Old Amarillo is beyond me because it is set in the modern day west . One of the schemes used in fact is an airplane trying to seed the clouds so they will rain . Another problem Roy has is Watkin's spoiled son Kenneth Howell who is more at home in a nightclub than home on the range . Watkin's sends Howell to Roy to straighten out , but he falls under Barcroft's influence instead . In the midst of all this Roy takes some time to woo Penny Edwards , granddaughter of another ranch owner , Elizabeth Risdon . Risdon usually played old battle axes in her films , she's probably best known at least in western films as Audrey Long's aunt who Gabby Hayes spanks in John Wayne's Tall in the Saddle . Here she's a nice old pioneer granny . In his later films Roy's Christianity was creeping more and more into his work . When all else fails he calls a cowboy prayer meeting in which he sings the song Wasteland hoping the Good Lord will prevent such a thing happening in Texas and give up with some rain . Of course you know what's going to happen , but you might want to check out the mysterious ways God moves In Old Amarillo .
395453	2483625	43550	5.0	Some Historical Revision Might Be Needed	Some other reviewer made a comment that this was the worst sports biographical film since The Babe Ruth Story that starred William Bendix as the Bambino . He might not have seen the independent productions about Jackie Robinson or Joe Louis which The Babe Ruth Story also was . There's less excuse for Follow the Sun because it was made by a major studio , 20th Century Fox . Ben Hogan did come from poverty , he earned money as a kid as a golf caddy and learned the game and learned it could be a way out of the dire financial straits his family was in . Yet that part of the Hogan story was never really developed in Follow the Sun . But the comeback he had after that near fatal automobile accident in 1949 is the stuff legends are made from . That part of the film is absolutely true and it was in fact the reason the film was made at all . Otherwise if someone wanted to do the Ben Hogan Story again , we'd certainly have the vantage of historical perspective now . In fact Tiger Woods is approaching the kind of numbers and the kind of impact that Hogan had in his day in the world of golf . A whole lot of Hogan's rivals and great golfers in their own right like Dr . Cary Middlecoff , Jimmy Demaret , and Slammin ' Sammy Snead all play themselves in the film . That in itself shows the respect his peers had for their rival . Grantland Rice who has never been approached in his title as dean of American sportswriters also appears as himself . Glenn Ford is not given all that much to work with as Hogan , he was very much on the scene and could have sued if he didn't like what he saw . Anne Baxter is the best in the film as Hogan's wife Valerie who both narrates the film and has her best scenes tending to and watching over her injured husband . Dennis O'Keefe plays the fictional Chuck Williams and too bad he was fictional because I really liked the guy . He's a happy-go-lucky sort of golfer , earn just enough to stay on tour . He has some great scenes clowning in the way Al Schacht and Nick Altrock used to do for baseball . June Havoc is his wife . Larry Keating has a strange role as a golf writer who doesn't like Hogan because he's not accessible to the press . That frankly is his business and Keating should have known that . It was a wholly artificial plot device . Even worse was when Ford as Hogan bears down like the competitor he always is and beats his good friend O'Keefe . Havoc takes all kinds of umbrage at that and O'Keefe is a bit put out . That was just plain dumb . Golf was the man's business and Hogan was the best and never gave less than his best . That plot device was worse than the feud with the writer . But the scenes involving the accident and recovery were well done and maybe Ben Hogan's story could use some historical revision now .
396729	2483625	35746	5.0	Commandos Invade Norway	In Commandos Strike At Dawn , Paul Muni is a Norwegian fisherman who does not like what the Nazis have brought in occupying his country . After a murder he resolves to leave Norway and do something about it . As Eric Toreson , Muni has his most stoic role with the exception of Benito Juarez . But his facial expressions and the controlled anger in his voice tell the story than a lot theatrics . It's unfortunate that a better story could not be utilized for a man of his talents . I'm still struggling over the idea that before the war an admiral of the Royal Navy , Cedric Hardwicke together with his daughter Anna Lee , are visiting Muni's village . It certainly doesn't look like a vacation spot or that she would take up with Muni who was certainly beneath her in the European class system . A year later Warner Brothers produced The Edge of Darkness also about the Norwegian resistance which starred Errol Flynn . Now Flynn was in no way in Muni's class as an actor , but as an action hero he certainly filled the bill . Lillian Gish is in this film as the wife of Ray Collins who is picked up for his anti-Nazi views and tortured . For someone of her talents , she's given little to do . Western fans will recognize B picture cowboy actor Rod Cameron in the role of the Lutheran parson of the village . George MacReady is the village school teacher in one of the few sympathetic roles he ever had on screen . Doing double duty is Alexander Knox as the Nazi captain among the occupiers of the village . You can also easily recognize Knox's voice as the unseen parson blessing the British commandos as they embark on a raid near Muni's village . It's typical World War II propaganda and if it weren't for the quality of the cast Commandos Strike At Dawn would barely be a blip on the nostalgia radar .
392975	2483625	69989	5.0	Playing for all the marbles	Charles Cioffi , the consigliere of a jailed Mafia chieftain decides to get a war started among the three Las Vegas crime families . Knowing that Angel Tompkins , singer girlfriend of the son of a recently deceased Mafia Don , is looking for a break , he arranges a meeting with Anthony Quinn , Godfather of the third Mafia family where nature takes its course . When former boyfriend Robert Forster returns to America and finds out it ain't long before the bullets start flying . When the film is over there are only a couple left standing and if you want to know who does pick up all the marbles than watch the film . Of course this film came out to take advantage of the enormous publicity reaped by The Godfather in the previous year . It's an average sort of gangster flick , it could have been done at Warner Brothers during the Thirties with their stable of gangster players . Al Lettieri and Abe Vigoda were both in The Godfather and their presence sort of lends an aura authenticity to the film . Lettieri was just coming into his own as a great portrayer of villains and assorted gangland types . His early death was a real loss to film . Anthony Quinn of course is always good and fans of his which are legion will want to catch The Don is Dead .
396743	2483625	43390	5.0	Oh Please , Wait A Minute Mr . Postman	For the life of me I can't understand why Loretta Young fought so hard to get this part . It hardly shows her to her best advantage on screen . She's terribly miscast in a role that Barbara Stanwyck could have phoned in or Joan Crawford have telegraphed . She's Mrs . Suburban Housewife to all appearances , married to Barry Sullivan who's now bedridden with a touch of illness . Physical and mental . Sullivan's conceived of a plot that Loretta's hatching with the doctor , Bruce Cowling to kill him . It's all in his mind , but Sullivan's written a letter to the District Attorney and Loretta gave it to the postman . Loretta spends the rest of the film trying to get that letter back , but in the end fate and good old Dr . Cowling seem to solve her problems in the end . I say seem to because given her behavior during most of the 73 minutes of the film , there ain't no way she ain't raised a few eyebrows . In other words she's got plenty Cause For Alarm . My guess is that since the character of the wife is on screen every moment of the film and narrates the melodrama Loretta might have seen it as a good woman's picture where the female dominates . She probably also wanted to expand her range from films like The Farmer's Daughter and Come to the Stable so she decided to poach on Stanwyck / Crawford territory . Her best scenes are with Irving Bacon the complaining postman and with Postal Superintendent Art Baker trying to retrieve that letter . Also she has some nice scenes with young Brad Morrow the kid in the Hopalong Cassidy suit which was just becoming the rage back then . The scenes with Morrow are to establish the niceness of her character , not the sort who plans on killing husbands . Cause For Alarm just was not material in Loretta Young's league .
394740	2483625	156030	5.0	Cowboys Halt A Coup	John Payne's first feature film western was El Paso in 1949 , but earlier on when he was under contract to Warner Brothers he did this Vitagraph Short about a Wild West Show that comes to a Ruritanian type kingdom in the Balkans . Young king Scotty Beckett is real enthusiastic about it , especially after Payne saves his life after he falls over from the royal balcony . But Payne has to keep doing it because some of the king's adult counselors are planning a coup d'etat . Payne and sidekick Cliff Edwards foil the plans of plotters Stuart Holmes and Boyd Irwin . The film is a cut down version of the Ken Maynard feature film Royal Rider and between all that life saving , several musical numbers get thrown into the bargain . I'm betting that Jack Warner was trying out young contract player Payne to see if he might make a passable singing cowboy . In any event within two years Payne was doing A musicals at 20th Century Fox with Alice Faye , Betty Grable , and Sonja Henie . And when he got around to westerns again , he sung not a note .
394665	2483625	282521	5.0	Lindsay Drew Gets A Clue	For this Disney Channel television movie Get A Clue , Lindsay Lohan turns Nancy Drew in everything , but name to solve the mystery of her disappearing teacher . Turns out that the teacher has a mysterious past , Ian Gomez used to be a high profile banker who was accused of embezzling ten million dollars from a bank he worked for in Arizona and has been living under an alias and teaching at a fashionable prep school where Lindsay goes . Gomez is also carrying on a romance with fellow teacher Amanda Plummer . But when Lindsay publishes an article in the school newspaper with his picture , somehow it comes to the attention of the police and other folks seeking to know Gomez's whereabouts . When Gomez fakes his death and disappears , Lindsay and her friends don't believe it and the four of them , Brenda Song , Bug Hall , and Ali Mukaddam go on the case . It's amazing that the kids seem to be one step ahead of the cops and the other seekers through creative use of the internet . Doesn't say much for New York's finest . Get A Clue is an amusing teen comedy that has its moments . It's not the best work that the Magic Kingdom ever did nor is it the top tier of Lindsay Lohan's work .
395568	2483625	43013	5.0	Ambitious , But Badly Executed	It's entirely possible that the VHS that I watched of this film was badly edited because the film seemed to begin in the middle . The Cloud Brothers , Robert Sterling and John Drew Barrymore , have settled in some country where there's a nice range war in progress . They've got both big cattle baron John Litel and a group of smaller ranchers against them . All they want to do is be left alone , but neither group will allow that . A third brother , Robert Preston , arrives on the scene . He's a noted outlaw named Kid Wichita and he really ratchets up the violence quotient . That also includes killing the sheriff who is Litel's son and Jack Elam who's married to Cathy Downs who he's taking a fancy to . This is a nice cast and John Drew Barrymore certainly showed he had the potential to be an earlier version of James Dean . The heritage of that name proved too much for that man though . One of the more ambitious undertakings from Eagle-Lion Studios . But The Sundowners was flawed in the execution . Yjr Robert Mitchum / Deborah Kerr Sundowners was far better .
393009	2483625	25472	5.0	Who's Looking To Blow Up The Panama Canal ?	One of the very few Spencer Tracy Fox films that is available is Marie Galante . In it Spence plays an American agent working out of the Canal Zone in Panama and trying to stop a plot from blowing the canal up and incidentally trapping the American fleet as it is steaming through . Complicating matters is Ketti Gallian playing the title role of the film . She's a French girl who gets picked up by a drunken sea captain and left ashore in Yucatan . She works her way down to the Panama Canal hoping to get a boat back to France , but she kind of blunders into the whole scheme of some master criminal to destroy the canal . Of course her undocumented presence without passport in the Canal Zone arouses everyone's suspicions . Only Tracy has faith in her . Marie Galante boasts the presence of Helen Morgan playing a variation on her Julie role from Show Boat . She's a drunken chanteuse and of course this too sadly reflected on her real life . She gets a couple of songs to do in her inimitable torch style , but nothing on the order of the hits Jerome Kern wrote for her . The usual suspects in films like this are there , but this is not World War II yet and alliances have not been formed . Also the reason for blowing up the canal reflects a bit more on today's politics than in those of that era interestingly enough . Marie Galante was an example of the kind of two fisted action parts that Spencer Tracy was doing over there with barely a stretch on his considerable talent . Still fans of Tracy will appreciate the film .
394371	2483625	236493	5.0	The Last Assignment Is The Last Straw	Luckless Brad Pitt can't seem to work off a debt that he owes crime boss Gene Hackman in an unbilled role . Four years earlier he got into a fender bender with Hackman right at the moment that Hackman was carrying someone in the trunk of his car . Only because it was a live someone , Hackman got off with a few years in the joint , but he makes sure Pitt pays and pays for that fender bender . His last assignment seems simple enough go to Mexico and find a bring back an antique pistol , a real piece of craftsmanship that several legends have been told about . But even that last assignment is the last straw for his girlfriend Julia Roberts . She gives him the old heave ho as he leaves for Mexico . But just to make sure Pitt follows through , Roberts is kidnapped and held hostage by James Gandolfini , a gay hit man with whom she bonds rather strangely with . Of course you don't expect things to go smoothly for Pitt . The Mexican is one of those murphy's law films , if anything can go wrong it does go wrong . The Mexican is a film that was made more than likely for no other reason than let's team Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts and get some real box office out of it . They seem to work well together , but this very quirky film just doesn't quite jell . Possibly it should have been played more as an out and out comedy than it was . James Gandolfini comes out best in this film . Still fans of Pitt , Roberts , and the Sopranos might like it . Although if you go in expecting to see Tony Sooprano , fuggedaboutit .
393324	2483625	79013	5.0	I'll See You In C-U-B -	According to the Citadel Film series book on Sean Connery , Sean violated a rule that both he and Charlton Heston normally follow , never take an assignment on an unfinished script . The cameras were rolling on the players before the final script was done and the results clearly show it . Cuba as a film certainly had potential , but it's not realized in this story . Sean Connery plays a British mercenary who is going to go to work for the tottering Batista regime . He's being hired on the strength of good work he did in Malaya where the British did successfully quell a Communist insurgency in the Fifties . Connery's got a lot of reservations when he sees the quality of the troops that Batista has . But that's not what's totally occupying his mind . He's found an old flame in Brooke Adams who is married to wealthy Cuban cigar factory owner Chris Sarandon . As a film Cuba veers back and forth between an action adventure , a political tract , and a romance novel , never really settling in any one category . Best performance in the film is that of Jack Weston who plays the archetypal ugly American . It's a sad film Cuba , because it had the potential to be a whole lot better .
393802	2483625	25371	5.0	Tragic Romance Along the Navajo Trail	In viewing Laughing Boy today I counted elements of Camille , Romeo and Juliet and Duel in the Sun in the plot of this Indian love story . Ramon Novarro plays the title role and he's a Navajo from way off in the rural part of the reservation . Lupe Velez is also a Navajo , but an orphan who is the live in mistress of William B . Davidson . It's doomed from the start . Lupe's been living too long in the white man's world and Ramon's family simply will not accept her . It ends bad for both of them . I've got a mixed reaction to the film . I've got to give some credit to MGM at that time for even attempting to make a film showing Indians as three dimensional people . They do in fact include some stereotypes , but give the studio credit for trying . Both Lupe and Ramon were big stars in the silent era and did make the transition to sound . They both had pleasant speaking voices . But both led lives that given the times should have been more discreet . They were both descending into B films at a steady pace . In Ramon's case the vogue for Latin lovers which crested with Rudolph Valentino in the silent era with Ramon as one of his imitators had long passed . MGM had trouble casting him . Laughing Boy might have been a better film if MGM had been trying to build Lupe and Ramon up instead of looking to be rid of both .
395055	2483625	175880	6.0	A Biblical Plague	I was enjoying Magnolia right up to the part where a biblical type of plague came down upon all the characters in the film and I was then wondering what it was all about . Magnolia is an episodic , along the lines of director / writer Paul T . Anderson's previous success , Boogie Nights . A whole bunch of people , tied to each other by a successful long running quiz show have a lot of life altering events happen to them within 24 hours . The problem was that in Boogie Nights you followed a community of people from the pornography industry over a period of years . In Magnolia this all happens over 24 hours , more like Crash , although I think Crash was better handled . Some parts are better than the whole . Several characters for me really stood out . Tom Cruise took a daring career move in playing a motivational speaker for hedonism and male supremacy . How he arrived at this particular doctrine he preaches and makes money off is his story . His hedonism is covering up a very deep hurt from childhood . I liked William H . Macy as a has been celebrity made by that quiz show as a child . He's come to the end of his rope being able to cash in on that celebrity . Now he's a forty something gay man , mooning over a young and humpy bartender at his local watering hole and thinking he could nail the guy with a little cosmetic improvement on his part . Magnolia was the last theatrical film of Jason Robards , Jr . who plays the producer of the quiz show , Kids Know Best . The idea was to match whiz kid type geniuses against grownups in some sort of academic bowl situation . It actually sounded like a good idea for a real quiz show , I'm surprised no one thought of it in real life . Robards is dying of cancer and he's made a mess of his life as well as his sons's . Their reunion is painful to say the least . But of all the performances in the film by the grownups , I liked young Jeremy Blackman as one of the current kids on the show . He's being pushed by a stage father , Stanley Spector , who's living vicariously through his kid . All these good performances and others just somehow don't come together in the way Boogie Nights or Crash does . And the ending with the plague of frogs descending on Los Angeles was really too much and unnecessary .
395529	2483625	52718	6.0	Preacher Dan Takes Out A Vampire	This is one of those classic cult films that get a devoted following from repeated viewings . I remember seeing it on television for the first time , hosted by that vampire fiend , Zacherley . Michael Pate is a mysterious gunfighter who seems invincible and there's a good reason for it , he's a vampire . Though he dresses in western garb , he's still an old world type vampire . Right after this film Eric Fleming got slated to play the lead in the long running western series Rawhide with that well known co-star of his , Clint Eastwood . He's the town preacher and he figures out what the town is plagued with . I think that when Fleming strapped on the six gun and faced Michael Pate in a gunfight , armed with revolver loaded with silver bullets , it was one of the great camp moments in film history . The bullets of course were on loan from the Lone Ranger . For that reason , this film gets as high a rating as six stars and should not be missed whenever it's broadcast .
393067	2483625	34882	6.0	" Hey Butcher , Hey Baker , Love's Landed a Real Haymaker "	It was not planned that way , but as it turns out the film adaption of the Rodgers & Hart Broadway musical I Married an Angel turned out to be the last pairing of Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald . Nelson in fact left Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer after this film and bought his own contract out for $250 , 000 . 00 according to a recently published book about the pair by Sheryl Rich . They are in good voice and the songs of Rodgers & Hart never got a better treatment . Unfortunately the film ran into some censorship problems about celestial creatures doing some very earthly things . Rodgers & Hart were busy on Broadway and couldn't help . Two very big shows for them , Pal Joey and By Jupiter kept them occupied . Nelson is a happy carefree Hungarian playboy who's grandfather started the Bank of Budapest . But Nelson would rather spend his time with wine , women , and song and since it's Nelson Eddy , song doesn't take third place to the other two . At his birthday party he's taken by a little known to him employee at the bank in an angel costume . Guess who that is ? Feeling a little the worse for wear from the revelry , Nelson takes a little snooze . During the dream Jeanette appears to him as a real angel and Nelson is smitten . He asks her to marry him and she agrees . She's without a dishonest bone in her heavenly body . Unfortunately her time in heaven has not prepared her to deal with certain earthly hypocrisies . It's one wild celestial ride that Jeanette gives Nelson . The title song , I'll Tell the Man in the Street , and Spring is Here are the big hit numbers from the Broadway show and the stars do them well . The satire comes off far better here than it did for Jeanette and Nelson in Bittersweet , but still censorship really crippled some of the best lines from Broadway . Binnie Barnes , Reginald Owen , Edward Everett Horton and Douglass Dumbrille give good support to the singing sweethearts . Barnes practically steals the show as the wisecracking earthly friend of MacDonald who sets out to teach her worldly ways . I think fans of MacDonald and Eddy and others who do knock this film ought to give it a second look . It's not as bad as some would make it out to be .
394210	2483625	43547	6.0	Close Air Ground Support	Flying Leathernecks finds John Wayne in the Marines again , but this time as a commissioned officer / pilot . He has an idea about better coordination with ground troops on that lovely tropic isle of Guadalcanal and he inherits a squadron that essentially become guinea pigs to test his theory out . He also inherits a resentful Executive Officer in Robert Ryan who keeps getting passed over for command . Ryan's a favorite with the men and he bleeds over the prospect of any of them being killed . Fine traits for a human being , but not something that works in a war situation . As so many others have said , Flying Leathernecks has a whole lot of the elements that made Sands of Iwo Jima a critical and popular success . Wayne and Ryan work well together , possibly the political differences with both in real life lent itself to the performances of both men . In the supporting cast you will like Jay C . Flippen as the larcenous sergeant in charge of the ground crews . Flippen provides a lot of what comic relief we have in Flying Leathernecks . Years later Flippen and Wayne worked together again after Flippen lost a leg to diabetes . Wayne gave him a small part in The Hellfighters to help him with medical expenses . Wayne did that on numerous occasions when he later produced films himself or had a say in casting . He wasn't about hand outs , but he always was ready to help an ill colleague with a pay day that did not rob folks of dignity . He didn't give jobs , he hired men as he said in a later filmNot the best stuff technically speaking for the air sequences . That Howard Hughes put in Jet Pilot with unfortunately a ridiculous story to go with it , not anything like the Flying Leathernecks story which admittedly is average at best . Still it's far from the worst or best work John Wayne ever did .
393098	2483625	53065	6.0	Get That Trophy Wife	The team that brought you Marty , writer Paddy Chayefsky and director Delbert Mann brought Middle Of The Night to the big screen . It was first an original drama for television with E . G . Marshall and Eva Marie Saint for the Philco Playhouse . It then went to Broadway where it ran 477 performances in 1956-57 and starred Edward G . Robinson and Gena Rowlands with Joshua Logan directing . Delbert Mann who did direct the original television play returns for the screen version and Paddy Chayefsky considerably expanded his play to accommodate for the screen . That was probably a most wise move by the producers . The story is a March / September romance between Kim Novak , a young divorcée and widower Fredric March who seems to have settled down to a dull existence with work and his children's problems . Kim's a troubled girl herself , having been hurt a few times by men her own age maybe looking for a bit of stability which she sees in March . March met certain criticism that he was not ethnic enough to play a middle aged Jewish businessman in the garment trade . But March overcomes the objections with talent honed over 40 years at that point . In fact he'd played an Italian father in one of the stories in It's A Big Country and done that well . There's a really nice performance from Albert Dekker as a salesman in March's firm who makes no secret of his flagrant abuses of his marriage vows when on the road trying to sell . The character is more than borrowed from Arthur Miller's Willy Loman in Death Of A Salesman which March starred in on the screen . It's a good film with a bad message , in fact I'm not sure what Chayefsky is trying to say . Basically it seems that he's saying get that trophy wife you rich old dudes and bear the problems that come with it . Novak causes March a good deal of headaches and if he marries her it's with the full realization a lot of heartaches are going to come with it . She's a lusty young girl with needs more than security and he's getting on in years . Need I say more . Better March start dealing with a reputable escort agency .
394335	2483625	53220	6.0	Allies Of Convenience	After a bad beginning because I could not believe the way that bounty hunter Randolph Scott was able to bring in James Best , the rest of the film fleshes out nicely to another tension filled western directed by Budd Boetticher and written by Burt Kennedy who would soon be directing features of his own . When Scott does bring in Best unfortunately he must rely on a pair of young guns , Pernell Roberts and James Coburn , to bring Best in . These two have one idea about what to do with Best , but Scott's working an agenda all his own . They settle down as allies of convenience . They have to because there are hostile Mescalero Apaches all around . For a while they fort up at a stagecoach station operated by Karen Steele and her husband . The husband's away and later we find out the Apaches have killed him . She's also forced to join the group . Besides Apaches , Best's brother Lee Van Cleef has heard about his capture . Van Cleef and Scott have a lot of history between them and that's part of the story as well . Ride Lonesome borrows quite liberally from the successful James Stewart / Anthony Mann western The Naked Spur where Stewart is also a bounty hunter forced to make some allies of convenience . When the film gets down to business , the best part of it belongs to Pernell Roberts and James Coburn in his feature film debut . They are one pair of morally ambiguous characters and right until the very end you don't know exactly whose side they will come down on . If only Burt Kennedy had devised a better way of capturing James Best at the beginning , Ride Lonesome would rank at the top of the Randolph Scott / Budd Boetticher collaborations . As it is , it's still not a bad film from the two of them .
396252	2483625	35689	6.0	Knute Rockne Joins the Army Air Corps	Pat O'Brien takes his Knute Rockne character and joins the Army Air Corps in Bombardier and he and Randolph Scott have a disagreement as far as air tactics go . Scott wants to do things as they do in the RAF where he's been an observer . Fly in low and drop bombs and avoid being shot at . O'Brien is more interested in technology . Develop and learn how to use an accurate bombsight so you can be up around 20 , 000 feet and only have to worry about enemy planes which presumably your fighter escort has to deal with . But since these guys are friends it's a good natured fight as both are in the business of training bombardiers . Among the familiar faces they train are Eddie Albert and Robert Ryan before both went in the service themselves . Bombardier is so very dated now , but still entertaining . The advances in technology are light years beyond what O'Brien and Scott are dealing with . Film buffs who are air historians might like it though .
392743	2483625	52877	6.0	" I catch them , I don't hang them . "	The Hangman finds Robert Taylor as a relentless U . S . Marshal who pursues criminals with the zeal of Lieutenant Gerard when he was hunting for Richard Kimble in The Fugitive . Barry Morse's words from that show could equally have served as Taylor's bywords , " I don't philosophize , I hunt . " Who he's hunting is the last man of a four man gang accused of a holdup where a death occurred . Two guys are already dead and one is sentenced to hang . But nobody knows who number four is or what he looks like . Taylor in his quest goes to an army post where he finds recent widow Tina Louise and he's authorized by Wells Fargo to offer a reward of $500 . 00 if she'll come to a town where he's reputed to be and point him out . When he arrives in town , the object of his quest who turns out to be Jack Lord is about the most popular fellow there . Why he didn't run for mayor or even for Fess Parker's job as sheriff is beyond me . But Taylor gets no help from anybody . The title derives from the nickname Taylor has acquired for his dogged dedication to duty . The Hangman is a western with very little action surprisingly , but it has a good character study by the mature Robert Taylor . It's a well rounded portrait of a man who'd like to leave the job he's in , but has grown used to it and it's the only living he's known for years . The Hangman was the first film Robert Taylor did outside MGM since Magnificent Obsession in the Thirties . He has a record , definitely unlikely to be broken now of the longest running studio contract in film history . The Hangman is a good , not great western besides those already mentioned I did enjoy Mabel Albertson's performance as a dotty old biddy who's eying Robert Taylor like a slab of romantic beef . Well he was one of the biggest screen heartthrobs ever . Personally , I think Taylor should have concentrated on westerns in his later years the same way Joel McCrea and Randolph Scott did . He liked making them and though he's not primarily known as a western star , films like Devil's Doorway , Saddle the Wind , The Last Hunt and The Law and Jake Wade hold up very well today . The Hangman's not as good as these I've mentioned , but it still has a fine performance from Robert Taylor and the rest of the cast .
393222	2483625	36105	6.0	Quite A History	A little research will yield some interesting results sometimes . Let's Face It was originally a very risqué comedy from the Roaring Twenties entitled Cradle Snatchers . It was written by Norma Mitchell and Russell Medcraft and produced on Broadway by Sam Harris and ran 332 performances in 1925 . It concerned some college kids working as gigolos who some married women pick up after their husbands take one too many trips out of town for some frolicking of their own . Two of the married women were Mary Boland and Edna May Oliver and one of the college kids was Humphrey Bogart . I would love to have seen this play . By the way it should be remembered at this time Bogart was playing young juveniles on Broadway and it was he who uttered the line " tennis anyone " for the first time . Maybe it was here . Fast forward to 1941 and Cole Porter sees the possibilities of this play as a book for one of his musicals . It certainly has the plot elements for his double entendre lyrics . The book was updated to have the gigolos be recent army draftees from a nearby camp and it starred Danny Kaye and Eve Arden . But as what happens in all of Cole Porter's work it gets watered down so it's a passably good comedy now for Bob Hope . Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn write extra material suited to Betty Hutton . Eve Arden repeats her role as one of the man hungry women . Betty Hutton is in this as the proprietor of a fat farm where three husbands led by Raymond Walburn dump their wives so they can frolic . Only this time Arden and her chums decide to do some frolicking on their own as in the original play . Who do they pick but Bob Hope and two of his fellow draftees . Hope incidentally is going out with Betty Hutton and she catches wind of the scheme . I think you can figure the rest out . Cole Porter's score was totally emasculated for the screen version . Some additional numbers were written for Betty Hutton , I don't think Porter exactly wrote her type of material . And of course it even has a Nazi submarine in the plot . That you have to see to believe . Hope and Hutton do click very well , it's a pity they didn't get to work together again on material that was constructed for them as opposed to something watered down . I imagine you could sure make a film of Cradle Snatchers now without the censor . But imagine , a story filmed by Humphrey Bogart , Danny Kaye , and Bob Hope . Great piece of trivia at your next tournament .
394557	2483625	51816	6.0	Was Sophia a Jinx ?	This is a curious film . A gritty , tough realistic movie during the action sequences at sea , but when the story shifts to land and Sophia Loren and the men her life , it's dull and lifeless . Trevor Howard and Bill Holden are men numbers three and four in refugee Sophia Loren's life . The key is the key to her apartment which the guys make duplicates of and pass on to friends . Right after that's done , the giver is killed at sea . Howard and Holden are tugboat captains assigned to tugs who go out to the open sea and pick up crippled freighters bringing needed war supplies to Great Britain during World War II and tow them in . The tugs are poorly armed and barely sea worthy and are easy marks for theGermans . It's hard tough work and director Carol Reed does a superb job showing that . This is one of the least glamorized war movies I've ever seen . The men are fatalistic to say the least , but especially around Sophia as if the Nazis weren't enough to worry about . Sophia Loren is a lovely thing of beauty and certainly a pleasure to watch , but her scenes with her two male co-stars have absolutely no spark at all . If you watch this I recommend you fast forward the romance and get to the action .
395405	2483625	174168	6.0	Early And I Mean Early Bing Crosby	The Road to Hollywood is a compilation of bits and songs from the Mack Sennett shorts that Bing Crosby appeared in during the time he was between the Paul Whiteman band and his first feature film starring role in The Big Broadcast . Probably in 1947 Bing Crosby was at the high point of his career . At that time he was number one in films , in record sales , and on the radio and no one has ever duplicated that success , albeit even with radio's successor television . He was probably the best known entertainer in the world at that time , it's first truly international star . There are some Crosby fans who consider his early work during the days of his crooning rivalry with Rudy Vallee and Russ Columbo to be his best and one can make an argument for it . If you feel that way , here is a great opportunity to see some Crosby performances of early solo hits he had like I Surrender Dear , Just One More Chance , Out of Nowhere , etc . In fact it was when William Paley heard Bing's record of I Surrender Dear that he made up his mind to sign him for a 15 minute radio show on CBS . The rest is history . For Crosby fans , a must .
394301	2483625	44158	6.0	Hughes showing ' em how it's done	Two Tickets to Broadway was to be Howard Hughes's answer to MGM type musicals and in fact he engaged the two leads from MGM , Tony Martin and Janet Leigh . The usual criticism was voiced with Martin being 15 years older than Leigh , but in this case it works because part of the plot is fresh faced Ms . Leigh avoiding being taken in by older Broadway sharpies . No memorable songs were written by composers Jule Styne and Leo Robin for this film and that's a pity because if a hit had come out of it , the film would be better remembered . Martin , I'm sure realized no hits were coming out of this and he probably had two of his own songs put in there . He had hit records around this time of the Prologue from Pagliacci and There's No Tomorrow ( O Sole Mio ) . He performs them well . I would love to know if Janet Leigh was dubbed and by who . I don't believe she ever sang in any other film . For that reason I suspect a dubbing if for no other reason that she wouldn't want to be going up against a singer with as powerful a voice as Tony Martin . Ironic that two of the players in this Ann Miller and Janet Leigh died this year . Nobody had to worry about dubbing Ann Miller in any department . She performs her big number , Let the Worry Bird Worry for You in classic style . Bob Crosby who by that time was known as the afternoon Crosby because his radio and later TV show came on in the afternoon unlike his legendary brother . Being the Bing Crosby fan that I am , I have a soft spot in my heart for his Let's Make Comparison where he's comparing himself to brother Bing . Bob led a pretty good jazz band at that time and had a modest career in B films . Eddie Bracken who was so good in his Paramount films was cloying and annoying in this one . His machinations trying to get his clients on the Bob Crosby show were downright stupid here and not terribly funny . The ending though was an unintentional hoot . Janet Leigh comes from Pelican Falls , Vermont and early in the film she's given a send off by the high school band performing their alma mater song . I thought the ending with the high school band , interrupting Bob Crosby's broadcast to reprise their high school song was ridiculous . Was that Howard Hughes's idea ? Well he didn't do as much damage here as he did on The Outlaw . The film had a lot of potential and it could have been done better even at RKO , but I suspect Howard Hughes meddled a bit too much here .
394875	2483625	33159	6.0	Very New Dealish for the Duke	Viennese surgeon Charles Coburn and daughter Sigrid Gurie arrive in America and are placed in a rural area of Oklahoma . They stay in a large old house with John Wayne and Spencer Charters . Pretty soon , despite Gurie's homesickness , they are involved in the social and political life in the area . This is the famous Oklahoma dust bowl era when drought and poor cultivation practices brought about a drying up of once fertile farm land . Wayne and the other farmers do their best to save the land , but in the end except a government offer to homestead new farm land created by a dam built in Oregon , I presume on the Columbia River or one of its tributaries . Gurie of course falls big time for the Duke . But she hears that Roland Varno who saved them from the Nazis and who she thought dead is still alive . Wayne of course leads a modern day wagon train to Oregon with automobiles instead of Conestoga wagons . He's got his own problems with Trevor Bardette , another farmer who's constantly trying to undermine his leadership . 23 years later John Wayne made McLintock which is more a serious statement of his conservative political and economic philosophy than one realizes . In Three Faces West we have him accepting a government program's help , albeit a self help type program . The film though is couched in terms good enough to satisfy any free marketeer . One thing I could not understand . Roland Varno purportedly risked his life to save Gurie and Coburn from the Nazis . But when both of them meet up with Varno in San Francisco , he's now a big time Nazi supporter and wants to take them back to Vienna to aid in his new cause . They are taken aback and walk right out on him . I'm somewhat taken aback myself . For the life of me I don't understand Varno's about face . The script gives us no explanation . It's a big hole in the plot . Three Faces West also labors under the handicap of coming out in the same year as The Grapes of Wrath . A much better film about the dust bowl and its economic effects .
396844	2483625	80097	6.0	Dudley DooRight versus Wile E . Coyote for Jessica Rabbit	I'm not quite sure why Kirk Douglas took the part of a live Wile E . Coyote in the film villain other than to say that he had now tried the slapstick comedy genre . But in this case the frustrated coyote is not matched up with the beeping road runner . His adversary is Dudley DooRight in the person of Arnold Schwarzneggar , the Handsome Stranger . Yes folks , that's his character name . We've got a third cartoon character in the mix , Ann-Margret doing a prototype of Jessica Rabbit . Annie's really showing off the stuff today with bosoms akimbo , she's got every member of the cast panting after her with the exceptions of Strother Martin who is her father and still sees Daddy's little girl and Arnie whom she pants after , but who doesn't show the slightest interest . The bulk of the film is taken up with Kirk as villainous Cactus Jack and his horse Whiskey , doing their best to stop Arnie and Ann and rob them of a large sum of money from banker Jack Elam to Strother Martin . It's here where all the comparisons to the road runner cartoons take place . I'm sure Kirk Douglas liked the change of pace , burlesquing his own western image . And he had a tough assignment because the majority of his scenes are alone and the dialog was spoken to his horse . Maybe Mr . Ed should have been cast in the role . If anybody noticed the name of the horse Whiskey is the same name that Kirk Douglas used for his horse in his acclaimed Lonely Are The Brave . Lest you think that because this is a road runner film the ending is a road runner ending . Let's just say that Jessica Rabbit has her needs and priorities as well .
393623	2483625	43968	7.0	" Paris is All of These Things That They've Left Unsaid . "	One of Jane Powell's best musicals for MGM is Rich , Young and Pretty and Ms . Powell winds up all three and married to boot . She and father Wendell Corey and housekeeper Una Merkel are in Paris where Wendell is on business for the United Nations where he works . But he wasn't always a high powered diplomat . After the first World War he took a French bride , Danielle Darrieux , back to Texas . Texas didn't agree with Danielle and she left Wendell and her infant daughter . Wendell has told Jane her mother had passed away . Of course all this deception by Corey leaves room for more deception by Danielle upon Jane's arrival in Paris . With a little subterfuge Darrieux and Powell meet . And Powell's also got eyes for a young French official , Vic Damone and she's forgetting about the boy she's seeing back home . The story line of Rich , Young , and Pretty gets a little too cute , but there are some talented players here to smooth out the rough spots . And Nicholas Brodzsky and Sammy Cahn wrote some nice songs . One of them , Wonder Why , was nominated for Best Song , but lost to In the Cool Cool Cool of the Evening . Still Wonder Why is a very pretty ballad , sung by both Damone and Powell . My favorite song however is Paris , a city that certainly has inspired some of our best songwriters . Here it's done by Fernando Lamas and sung well . Fans of this talented cast will want to see their stars perform even though the story is a bit silly .
393667	2483625	87985	7.0	Call Out The Wolverines	The scenario depicted in Red Dawn didn't happen as we all know . The Cold War ended with a fadeout instead of a bang , the USA did not get invaded . At first glance Red Dawn seems like a quaint and ancient propaganda piece , but it still raises some interesting issues . Note how the invasion of America happened . Lots and lots of illegal aliens crossed our borders and infiltrated from within . Back in the day Red Dawn was National Rifle Association recruiting material , today however it's the film that the strict immigration people must love the most . Several members of the Eighties Brat Pack gave stand out performances in Red Dawn like Patrick Swayze , C . Thomas Howell , Jennifer Grey , Lea Thompson and Charlie Sheen . Considering what he's peddling now , I wonder if Charlie Sheen likes to be reminded of his participation in Red Dawn . Swayze and Howell are brothers who when the paratroop invasion happens at their high school , they zoom on out of there , take supplies , weapons and ammunition and lead a guerrilla movement in their little corner of Colorado . It's fascinating that the northeast of the United States didn't get invaded and that was the Free Zone . You wonder if the young people in blue state America would fight as these kids do . Kids like Howell and Swayze today are what make up our Armed Forces , they are a precious commodity indeed , blood not to be spent extravagantly or unwisely . Red Dawn is dated in some ways , relevant in others . It's super-patriotic , jingoistic , never explains really but for a brief voice over prologue why all these people don't like us . But at the same time it invokes a fighting spirit in America that I hope never dies , because we will die . It's nice to discuss geopolitics , look for economic solutions to age old problems , try to make people respect each other's differences . When the bombs are dropped though , discussion and reason are over .
394074	2483625	43680	7.0	The U . S . A . of the Cold War	I doubt if a film like It's A Big Country could be made in and about the America of post Vietnam and Watergate . A whole lot of the clichés presented here just aren't bought any more by large segments of the population . For whatever it's worth the film is a presentation of what we thought about ourselves in 1951 . It's a film with several different segments , some serious some pretty funny about every day Americans in all walks of life , in all parts of the then 48 states . The two I liked best were those that ironically starred the two men who were not MGM contract players , Gary Cooper and Fredric March . Gary Cooper plays a Texas cowboy talking about his state and disillusioning us with a tongue in cheek delivery about the way Texans and Texas are perceived by the other 47 states . Of course Cooper's humor and the whole premise behind this segment was that Texas was our largest state in land mass . That ended in 1959 when Alaska became the 49th state , still it's the highlight of It's A Big Country . Fredric March plays an Italian American father who's opposed to his son , Bobby Hyatt , getting needed glasses even after teacher Nancy Davis tells him it's necessary . He's got some old world ideas that need a bit of adjustment . March plays the role with dignity never do you feel he's a caricature . Another episode that is nicely done involves Gene Kelly , Greek American boy falling for Janet Leigh , Hungarian American girl . They've got a problem though , her father played by Hollywood's number one Hungarian S . Z . Sakall . In the past 20 years we've seen a whole lot of stories about ancient ethnic hatreds coming out of Eastern Europe . Sakall is carrying some old grudges against Greeks though he really isn't sure why . Point being that here in America you're supposed to leave that all behind . That segment is still very much relevant . Could we make It's A Big Country today ? Not at this time , maybe at some future point when we've reached a national consensus that despite all our problems , America's a pretty good place after all .
395852	2483625	52445	7.0	" He Wore A Cane And Derby Hat , They Called Him Bat , Bat Masterson "	One of the things about this show that lingers in my mind besides the nattily dressed Gene Barry was the fact that this show eschewed any kind of supporting cast . No sidekicks , no permanent love interests , what you got was Gene Barry as Bat Masterson taming the west in his own small way . The real Bat was quite the dude himself , maybe not as noble a character as Barry played him . That cane was as effective as the Irish Shillelagh and he used it more to disarm opponents than kill them . He wasn't always the gentleman , Masterson did make a living as a scout and a buffalo hunter and I doubt he was so stylish on the trail . Barry was a literate and bright western hero , he would have to be because the real Bat Masterson eventually made a living as a newspaper reporter for a quaint metropolitan newspaper . If he didn't always battle for truth , justice , and the American way , he always reported it in a dignified manner . The real Bat Masterson made his living in the last century , died , and is buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx . I think he would have liked the way Gene Barry played him .
393422	2483625	202489	7.0	" It All Belongs To Applegate "	My first exposure to the Hardy Boys came courtesy of this serial from the Mickey Mouse Club . It was after seeing this that I bought a load of the Hardy Boys kids novels to read . Those two certainly did have some adventuresome lives . No doubt that later incarnations of the boys with Parker Stevenson and Shaun Cassidy in the Seventies and later for Canadian television Paul Popowich and Colin K . Gray in the Nineties were good in their day , but Tommy Kirk and Tim Considine will be the quintessential Hardy Boys for this former devoted Mouskaviewer . The film is based on the very first of the Franklin K . Dixon novels which came out in the Roaring Twenties , The Tower Treasure . The Disney Studio nicely updated the story to fit into the Fifties . The boys get wind of a secret treasure hidden in the dark secluded mansion of miser Applegate . Somebody's taking very seriously the legend that pirate gold is hidden there . And miser Applegate , played by Florenz Ames isn't a guy to ask for help . In the books the Hardy Boys did have a living mother who was not a really memorable character , just your average good mom . Their father is Fenton Hardy , formerly of the NYPD and now a famous private detective . In this serial , he's played by Russ Conway . But the show made Fenton a widower and had Sarah Selby as their constantly interfering Aunt Gertrude . She was in the books as well , but here she was the female of the house . Half the time Kirk and Considine were trying to outfox her to get to their sleuthing business . Selby was memorable I have to say . However what you will remember best is that Treasure Island pirate theme song of the serial about ' gold doubloons and pieces of eight ' that is guaranteed to rattle around in your brain for weeks upon hearing it . The Disney channel used to run all these old shows , but around 2000 just surrendered and now run their new shows on the cable network . Hopefully stuff like this will see the light of day again .
395223	2483625	35798	7.0	What a Fellow Does For a Friend	Randolph Scott and Glenn Ford were once outlaw pals together , but now Scott's a sheriff and young Ford is still hiring his gun out . He gets hired to pull a bank job , but is delayed getting to town and those that hired him get someone else . That leads to all kinds of complications , a lot for a film that's not even 90 minutes long . Randy and Glenn both got girls here . Claire Trevor plays her usual good time gal with a heart of gold . And Evelyn Keyes is the daughter of Edgar Buchanan who falls for Ford big time without realizing who he is or why he came to the town that Scott is the sheriff in . It's B western , but unusual for the time and for Columbia Pictures it was given the full technicolor treatment . The Desperadoes marked Glenn Ford's first film in technicolor , a process reserved only for some of the more expensive films from bigger studios . Harry Cohn was certainly not one to shell out for it . And definitely not during war time . The plot gets a bit convoluted as both Ford and Scott are put to the test of friendship versus expediency / duty . The plot also involves some high class hypocritical skunks in Randy's town who are the real outlaws as far as the film is concerned . The four leads do a fine job and the best supporting performance is Guinn Williams as Ford's lovable explosive lunkhead of a sidekick . The climax involves a cattle stampede and a shootout in the town saloon and is one of the best ever done in a western film . Fans of the four leads and westerns in general will enjoy this one .
396335	2483625	25718	7.0	Gee , Now Who Didn't Think They Were Talking About Barbara Hutton ?	The Richest Girl in the World in 1934 meant Barbara Hutton . Her exploits made her the Paris Hilton of the day . Did anyone seriously think that by titling the lead character Dorothy Hunter that RKO wasn't trying to cash in on Hutton's reputation ? Miriam Hopkins as Dorothy Hunter is naturally concerned with both privacy and wanting to know if she would really be marrying someone for love . She's hatched a scheme with her secretary Fay Wray to in public exchange identities . But that may come to an end soon as Fay is looking to marry Reginald Denny . But along comes Joel McCrea who's got his own ideas about supporting himself in the true McCrea tradition . Hopkins crushes out on him big time and he falls for her thinking she's the secretary . I can't say more , but any movie fan can take this plot from here . Still the leads are at their best and the film is good entertainment . But who was RKO kidding ?
394625	2483625	87222	7.0	Torturer In Chief	In 1984 the film The Evil That Men Do was very relevant because of the news coming out of El Salvador . During the Cold War the USA supported some pretty nauseating folks , El Salvador's regime was one of them . The unnamed Central American country where the action takes place is El Salvador . Charles Bronson is a retired hit-man who takes a commission to avenge the death of Theresa Saldana's husband , a journalist critical of the regime . The guy she holds responsible is Joseph Maher , known as ' El Doctor ' a bloodless sadist of distinctly non-Latin origin who apparently holds the rank of torturer in chief . It's Maher's performance which you will remember from The Evil That Men Do . He's a man who apparently studied under Joseph Mengele and learned the trade well . He has but one weakness , for his lesbian sister , Antoinette Bower . Bronson plays on that to get his man . Also note some good work from Raymond St . Jacques as Maher's number one assistant and from John Glover a sleazy CIA station chief in Central America who apparently Maher and company can call on for help . Jose Ferrer is in the film all too briefly at the beginning as he hires Bronson on Saldana's behalf . He's always been a favorite of mine , I wish there was more of him here . As for the climax , Director J . Lee Thompson took his inspiration from Tennessee Williams's Suddenly Last Summer . Some very eerie parallels to what happens to Sebastian in that film . I like The Evil That Men Do because it deals with evil as an entity unto itself . We just have to remember to realize that . The Doctor is pure evil and we rejoice in bringing him down .
394551	2483625	26073	7.0	Little Sure Shot Gets Her Man	Annie Oakley ( 1860-1926 ) born in dire poverty and without spending one day in a school room , became one of the great feminist icons of all time . Talk about taking a man on in his game and beating him . It was not press agent ballyhoo about her prowess as a rifle shot . This romanticized biographical film captures the essence of her character and her love for the guy she dethroned as shooting champion . In some spots of the film you can practically drop the songs that Irving Berlin was later to write for his hit show about Annie . But we get a different picture of Frank Butler than in Annie Get Your Gun . Butler is not even Butler , he's Toby Wheeler as played by Preston Foster . He's a kid from the mean streets of New York City who learned his sharpshooting in the shooting galleries on the Bowery . He doesn't near and endear himself to the westerners working at Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show . In fact they hate Foster so much that whatever qualms they had about Annie being a member of the female sex the crew gets over real fast . Barbara Stanwyck captures the real Annie if not in height in spirit . The real Ms . Oakley was barely five feet tall , but by all accounts she was a modest retiring type who never forgot where she came from . She was not as raucous as Ethel Merman on stage and later Betty Hutton on screen portrayed her . She let her shooting speak for her . Melvyn Douglas has the third lead as William F . Cody's business partner Jeff Hogarth . Melvyn usually lost the girl to bigger name players though he was always a gentleman as he is here . Personally I wish he had done better in this film especially . Annie Oakley is a nice film , not as well known as the musical later derived from her life , but still easy to take with good players at their best .
395254	2483625	26056	7.0	Alice Tries To Get A Fellow	Showing her versatility Katharine Hepburn gets her best part since her Oscar winning Morning Glory in the title role of Alice Adams . Alice and Eva Lovelace are worlds apart . Eva leaves her small town in search of fame and fortune in the theater . But poor Alice just wants to compete with the rest of the girls in her midwest Indiana small town that Booth Tarkington wrote about and land a real Prince Charming of a fellow . The Prince shows up at a dance she goes to in the person of Fred MacMurray . She's taken with him , but she's ashamed of her family's rather humble living condition . When MacMurray does come calling they have a family dinner that turns into a real disaster . Kate got one of her Oscar nominations for her role and MacMurray also gets one of his best early film parts as well . Kate's family is also nicely cast with Ann Shoemaker , Frank Albertson , and especially Fred Stone filling out the roles of mother , brother , and father . I do kind of feel sorry for Stone , he's really put upon by his family . In today's world Ann Shoemaker would have gone out and gotten a second job for another income , back then that would have been unthinkable . Alice Adams is a nice nostalgic trip by Booth Tarkington into the lives and mores of small town Indiana . This film was also George Stevens's first major film and he'd work with Kate again in Woman of the Year .
392911	2483625	25955	7.0	Too Beautiful For Words	Maybe Wake Up and Dream is not that . But that is the title of one of three songs Russ Columbo both sung and had a hand in writing for this film that was to launch his career as a musical film star with Universal Pictures . In his other feature film lead , Broadway Through a Keyhole , Columbo was not called on to act much , but sing beautifully . He does again here , but also begins to show traces of a nice film personality . No doubt he would have been a fine romantic lead . Russ , together with June Knight and Roger Pryor are a vaudeville trio act where Russ is clearly the lead and the talented one . The film is a story of their misadventures to get to stardom for at least one of them and the romantic triangle that was complicating things . At the time Wake Up and Dream was being shot Columbo was doing a fifteen minute weekly radio show with Hollywood columnist Jimmy Fidler . I happen to have a bootleg recording of that broadcast where Fidler plugs his co-star's upcoming film . It was in July of 1934 and on September 2 , 1934 , Russ Columbo was shot accidentally with an antique dueling pistol by friend and companion Lansing Brown . Even more ironically on August 31 , 1934 Columbo entered a recording studio for the first time in a year and a half . He had a dispute with RCA Victor which kept him contractually from recording anything . He did four sides in that session , the three songs from Wake Up and Dream : Too Beautiful for Words , Let's Pretend There's A Moon , and When You're In Love together with I See Two Lovers from the Rudy Vallee / Helen Morgan film , Sweet Music . This was to be the start of a long term deal with Brunswick Records who had just lost the services of Bing Crosby who had gone to that new company Decca , that year . As you can see this man's career was entering into high gear . In fact Universal planned to star him in what would be their big budget musical film , Showboat as Gaylord Ravenal . Eventually of course Allan Jones played the part opposite Irene Dunne . Jones was great in the role , but Russ would have made a fine Ravenal . Wake Up and Dream also features Henry Armetta as Columbo's foster father who is being chased by lovesick fortune teller Catherine Doucet . They do a fine obbligato version of When You're In Love after Columbo and June Knight sing it as a duet . When Russ Columbo died before the film was released , Universal of course took a great loss . Columbo was intended to be their musical star opposite Bing Crosby at Paramount or Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers at RKO or even Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald at MGM or Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler at Warner Brothers . Universal had to wait a few more years before getting a box office bankable musical performer in Deanna Durbin . It was a great loss monetarily for Universal Pictures , but an even bigger loss to cinema that Russ Columbo died so tragically at the age of 26 . I think you'll agree with me if you ever see Wake Up and Dream .
393910	2483625	25315	7.0	How Charley Succeeds	It Happened One Day finds young Charley Chase , a veritable Sammy Glick of the Thirties , getting hired by a firm headed by Oscar Apfel . Two problems with that , Apfel had some unpleasant run ins with the bumptious Chase . Chase even makes an offhanded comment about marrying the boss's daughter and the other employees immediately take it in their minds to put the upstart in his place . Popular Chase leading lady Betty Mack is Apfel's daughter and on a train trip back from Long Beach the two of them meet and do fall for each other . Life does take some funny turns . Chase was perfectly cast as a bumptious type . Thirty years later I could have seen him doing How To Succeed In Business Without Really Trying . This was one short which depended more on character than gags for laughs and Chase succeeded admirably .
395696	2483625	44782	7.0	Bing Under The Live Oak Tree	This is the second of two films Bing Crosby partnered with Jane Wyman after their stunning success in Here Comes The Groom . This time Paramount gave them color and Ethel Barrymore and the results are a treat . Bing's a successful stage actor who's about to marry his leading lady , Jane Wyman , when he discovers he's got a communication problem with his two kids . Daughter Natalie Wood wants to get into an exclusive girl's school and son Robert Arthur misreads some signals and starts crushing big time on Wyman . Ethel Barrymore is headmistress of the school and she helps Crosby solve his daughter's problems . His son , after writing a love ballad for Wyman , is rebuffed and joins the Air Force . All is righted in the end and in the usual Crosby charming way . Paramount gave Bing some good production numbers out of the Harry Warren-Leo Robin score . Bing sings I'll Si Si You In Bahia as a number from the show he's rehearsing and later sings The Live Oak Tree with the girls from the St . Hilary's School at their picnic . He also does a nice vaudeville patter number with character actor Ben Lessy called On the 10-10 from Ten-Ten-Tennessee . The big hit is a duet with Crosby and Wyman called Zing a Little Zong which is a complete ripoff of the number he and Wyman did for Frank Capra in Here Comes The Groom . Well if they can't ripoff from themselves who can Bing and Jane ripoff from ? The song was nominated for an Oscar , but lost to Do Not Forsake Me from High Noon . Just For You is the title song and it's the one that Arthur writes for Wyman . A couple of numbers that Crosby recorded failed to make the cut , Spring Fever and A Flight of Fancy . The latter is heard as an instrumental background . It's one of my favorite Crosby songs and I wish it had been done in the film .
392777	2483625	86200	7.0	She's In Product , He's In Sales	Risky Business and All The Right Moves are the two films that launched Tom Cruise's career as brat pack film star . Unlike so many of his contemporaries from the Eighties , he's proved to have staying power and will no doubt continue to do so . All The Right Moves established Cruise as a dramatic actor , but Risky Business is a fun comedy about a hormone driven teenager who when the folks go away from his Chicago suburban home and he's left to play , he gets himself in all kinds of problems . First dialing up call girl , Rebecca DeMornay and then not having enough coin of the realm to pay her . Then getting mom's treasured glass egg stolen . And then getting the family car driven into Lake Michigan . But Cruise and DeMornay , who is having trouble with her pimp Joe Pantoliano , hit on the brilliant idea that there's a market out there for his group of eager overachievers . And Tom's house becomes quite the swinging brothel . Risky Business turns out to be pretty funny business . Best scene in the film involves Tom with Princeton interviewer Richard Mazur . You've got to love the way this boy gets into the Ivy League . Second best scene involves Tom and the family car as it plunges into the lake and then gets hoisted out . Tom's definitely proved to have staying power in show business . I can see his character in Risky Business growing up to be Jerry Maguire .
395589	2483625	44085	7.0	Bill Holden Had To Wait For Another War	The problem that Submarine Command had from the start is that it came out in the same year as Operation Pacific which had similar plot situations . It might be better known today if that were not the case . As it is it's not a bad action adventure film and no disgrace to its star William Holden or any of the supporting cast . When I reviewed Operation Pacific I said that I like submarine films , but inevitably the same situations and clichés follow into each film . In this case William Holden was a newly assigned Executive Officer to the USS Tiger Shark and he was a recent Annapolis graduate who had just done a few shakedown cruises and had never seen any real combat . And it's the summer of 1945 . In action Holden like John Wayne in Operation Pacific is forced to leave his wounded captain , John Gregson on top and dive the submarine and take command . This gains the enmity of CPO William Bendix who was devoted to captain Gregson . Wouldn't you know it , the day this happens , Holden's only experience under fire during World War II is the day the Japanese surrender and news of it comes when the Japanese suddenly break off an engagement with the Tiger Shark . Unlike the Duke who got an opportunity in this war to redeem himself in a few eyes , Holden had to wait until Korea for his chance . In the meantime he marries Nancy Olson . Submarine Command was their fourth and final film together , the two had been teamed for Sunset Boulevard , Union Station , Force Of Arms , and now Submarine Command . Three good films and one classic isn't a bad record . Olson seemed to be Paramount's answer to MGM's June Allyson in those good girl next door roles . She and Holden clicked very well on screen . Of course the incomparable William Bendix is here as well . That man never gave a bad performance in anything he was in . He and Holden worked together at Paramount in Blaze At Noon and Streets Of Laredo . They would not be teamed again as well . Although I liked Operation Pacific better , Submarine Command is a fine film on its own that just suffered from bad timing . Fans of William Holden will like it .
395999	2483625	43859	8.0	Nothing Like Becoming Part of Your Own Experiment	No Highway marks both the reunion film of James Stewart and Marlene Dietrich and Stewart's second film with Henry Koster as director . Stewart never played an intellectual before , but he's quite convincing here as the absent minded aeronautical scientist . Stewart is a widower who is Rhodes Scholar , an American who decided to stay in Great Britain . He married and had a daughter , but his wife was killed in the blitz and he's raising his daughter in the off-time between his scientific projects . His interpretation of a man who in his grief has just buried himself in his work is very well handled . We first see the way he lives after his new boss Jack Hawkins gives him a lift home . His daughter Janette Scott is a bright little girl , approaching her puberty though and not real well equipped to handle it . Stewart is convinced that a new type metal alloy used on a new line of aircraft passenger planes will weaken after so many hours of flight and cause crashes . Hawkins urges him to report his suspicions , but the ivory towered Stewart refuses until his scientific calculations have been thoroughly checked out . All of a sudden he gets good and personally involved in his own experiment . He's flying to Newfoundland and learns he's on one of those planes he considers defective . He is a respected scientist and people listen to him , like stewardess Glynis Johns and traveling film star Marlene Dietrich . Of course when the tail section does not fall off in the time he thought , Stewart is made the object of ridicule . He disables the same plane he was on which was making a further stop in Montreal . I think you can guess where this one is going , but it's a pleasant journey nonetheless . Stewart did in fact another variation of this same character in Dear Brigitte for Henry Koster and with Glynis Johns as his leading lady . Of course that film isn't as good . Janette Scott said that during the filming of No Highway , Marlene Dietrich was kind and gracious to her and gave her innumerable pointers on how to act and react before the camera . Stood her in very good stead in Scott's later career . Poor Marlene , two films with James Stewart and she didn't get him in either . Of course during Destry Rides Again they were in the midst of a torrid affair and it was a more important film for both of them . For the film is about aircraft design without any derring do heroics , No Highway has no pretensions . Stewart since his service in the Army Air Corps in World War II was a well known advocate of air power and this maybe the best of his films concerning that subject .
393004	2483625	52303	8.0	It's All On The Line For Glenn Ford	I happen to like submarine movies , but normally the plot situations are the same in every one of them . Torpedo Run though it bares most resemblance to the Cary Grant World War II film from Warner Brothers , Torpedo Run has a unique involvement of Ford's family in combat . Japanese intelligence has marked Ford as one of America's top submarine commanders so when on a mission , Ford receives word that his wife and three young daughters have been accounted for in the Phillipines and are being held by the Japanese , you've got to wonder . The Swiss government which did the liaison work during World War II regarding prisoner information and exchange has just gotten word about Diane Brewster and the daughters . The devilish orientals have something up their sleeves all right . A transport ship with the civilian prisoners is screening the new pride of the Japanese fleet , one humongous aircraft carrier . That's not something Cary Grant faced in Destination Tokyo or any other American submarine skipper in any other film I remember . It's a grim Glenn Ford we see doing his duty in World War II . Only Executive officer Ernest Borgnine knows exactly what's at stake for Ford and he's reliable and supportive . The flashback sequences before the war involving Ford and Brewster are poignant and contribute to the overall tension of Torpedo Run . The combat and rescue sequences are well staged . Torpedo Run is a good portrait of a man under tremendous stress . My guess is that Ford was cast in this role seeing how well he performed in another film involving a pressure situation , Ransom . Glenn Ford's legion of fans and fans of World War II films in general will applaud Torpedo Run .
395884	2483625	60955	8.0	Word Of Mouth Into A New Life	In Seconds life's become pretty boring for John Randolph , no interest in the little woman any more , a dead end job , all the money in the world , but no interest in spending it anywhere . So when he gets a call from an old friend who he's heard has died , the possibilities are intriguing . Start over with a newly reconstructed body and a little more spring in your step so to speak . As you can gather this is a service that only the people that Robin Leach talks about can afford . It's kind of hush / hush and news of it is passed on by word of mouth . We just don't want any slug out there being able to have something like this . Imagine going in for some heavy duty surgery going in John Randolph and coming out Rock Hudson ? Of course not everyone quite takes to the new life , but The Company that provides this new life and identity has their ways of dealing with unsatisfied customers . John Randolph / Rock Hudson plays the man seduced by the promise of eternal youth and health and pleasure . It's one of Rock Hudson's most highly rated performances and deservedly so . Production wise , Seconds does resemble a rather long episode of the Twilight Zone , but that's not a derogatory comment . The Company provides some people to help newbies transition . Two of the best performances are Wesley Addy as a rather creepy factotum assigned to Hudson and Salome Jens as a woman who evinces interest in the new man that is Hudson . Seconds is not a feel good movie , but it's a great horror story told without any of the usual monsters , blood , and gore associated with the genre . If you see Seconds , it will raise some disturbing questions .
395402	2483625	43286	8.0	Now who'd have thought angels would be helping a bunch of pirates .	Before the New York Mets came along , the Pittsburgh Pirates were the first name in baseball for flat footed futility . At the time that Angels in the Outfield was made the Pirates had a long term lease on the National League cellar . In fact the only reason the Pirates drew any crowds at all was the presence of the premier slugger in the National League , Ralph Kiner . One shudders to think where they might have finished without him . But that's reality . In this film some heavenly help is granted the Pirates , presumably by a long suffering Deity who's maybe a Pirate fan . That is on condition that manager Paul Douglas clean up his act . He's told that by unseen angel James Whitmore . As it turns out Douglas is not the only one getting celestial visitations . He only hears angels , but little Donna Corcoran sees them behind every Pirate player on the field . When reporter Janet Leigh writes the story all kinds of complications ensue . Even without the special effects of the 1994 remake , Angels in the Outfield still maintains an innocent charm that is irresistible to baseball fans of a perennial losing team . After all we found out in Damn Yankees the kind of outside help they've been getting to stay on top . Nine years later the Pirates were in fact World Series winners , humbling the mighty Yankees in seven games . And for thirty years after that the Pirates were a contending ball club . They're back in the doldrums that Angels in the Outfield portrays . Maybe time for another heavenly assist .
394529	2483625	36342	8.0	Good Old Uncle Charlie	I don't believe Shadow of a Doubt will rank as one of Alfred Hitchcock's best film . But second rank Hitchcock is better than most people's best efforts . Joseph Cotten has come for a visit to Santa Rosa , California to see his sister Patricia Collinge and her family . They welcome him as the prodigal brother . But his very perceptive niece named after him played by Teresa Wright suspects something is wrong with this picture . Uncle Charlie is suspected of being a serial killer with the monniker of The Merry Widow Killer . He strangles rich old widows and robs them . I guess it's a living , albeit one with risks . Those risks are getting to him and on some levels you see Cotten almost wants to be caught . In fact Teresa starts to suspect him over a trivial incident involving her dad's paper . Cotten goes to great lengths to hide a feature story about The Merry Widow Murders . When she goes to the library to see what was in the paper that he didn't want the family to see , this is when she starts figuring it out . Really all Cotten had to do is nothing . But he really did want it to end . I'm not sure any player ever had such an auspicious beginning in such top rated films as Teresa Wright . In the space of three years she appeared in The Little Foxes , Mrs . Miniver , Pride of the Yankees and now Shadow of a Doubt . She's a Nancy Drew if Nancy had ever discovered there was a criminal who was a close relative . Patricia Collinge essentially repeats her role from The Little Foxes . If she's not quite as daft as Miss Birdie , she's still kind of operating within her own world . Henry Travers does fine as her husband as does Hume Cronyn as his partner in their own make believe world of crime . Of course giving a big assist to Ms . Wright's suspicions is the presence of detectives MacDonald Carey and Wallace Ford . They are a team chasing Cotten as one of two men they think is the Merry Widow Killer . One thing with this film is that unlike Suspicion , Hitchcock stood firm and did not bow to pressure to exonerate Cotten like he did with Cary Grant in the previous film . Of course Cotten was fairly new to the cinema so he could be cast as a villain . And Hitchcock does what he does best , toy with the audiences emotions . Like Suspicion when a whole lot of things happen to Teresa Wright they can be explained away and there is that red herring of that other suspect across the continent . Of course the other part of Shadow of a Doubt is how the thing is resolved in regard to Cotten's family . The ending might be a bit too pat , but still it does tie up the loose ends in the best way for all concerned .
392751	2483625	51525	8.0	Cellmates and Soulmates	There is this story going around that Robert Mitchum refused the part Tony Curtis eventually played because he did not want to work with a black man . The actual story is that Mitchum who did spend time on a southern chain gang said there was no way that back in the day a black and white man would have been chained together in the first place . In fact Stanley Kramer must have taken the critique in stride because sheriff Theodore Bikel has a line of explanation saying the warden had a sense of humor . Though the film dates a bit , it's still quite dramatic even now . Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier chained together have an unplanned jail break while being transported . Curtis has all the attitudes typical of his time and Poitier doesn't take nothing off anybody . Still joined at the hip as they are , they do need each other and find eventually there's more that unites than divides them . Besides Theodore Bikel in a strange role for him as a laconic southern sheriff , look for good performances from Lon Chaney , Jr . who runs a turpentine work camp who saves Curtis and Poitier from a lynching and Cara Williams as a trampy white trash farm lady whose needs haven't been met for a while . Tony Curtis in an incredible act of generosity insisted on equal billing for Sidney Poitier since due to the nature of the film , they are on screen together for most of it . That act of generosity may have cost him an Oscar for both he and Poitier were nominated for Best Actor , but lost to David Niven for Separate Tables . An act that rankles Tony Curtis to this day because at the drop of a hat he will insist Niven got ' his ' Oscar . Despite the sour grapes , The Defiant Ones though dated is still a good bit of cinema .
396357	2483625	36174	8.0	Turned Out To Be Lucky After All	Along similar lines to Suspicion , dapper Cary Grant plays a gambler confidence man with two problems that he solves in what he thinks is a masterstroke . The army is out to draft him so he has another crook with high blood pressure , Paul Stewart , pose as him at the draft physical . He also takes the name of a dead Greek sailor on a gambling boat that was raided . Of course when it turns out that the sailor had a lengthy criminal record including three felony convictions , that's not so good . On to a big score however . Grant offers his services to a war relief committee that is run by Park Avenue dowagers like Gladys Cooper and Florence Bates with the idea of doing a Las Vegas Night and stealing the take . Of course when pretty Laraine Day who's also involved in the committee comes on the scene , Grant reassesses himself . Especially after he gets a letter for the dead Greek sailor and has Greek Orthodox priest Vladimir Sokoloff translate it . MGM did a similar story about a draft dodger in For Me and My Gal which was Gene Kelly's debut film . That one was a good deal lighter than Mr . Lucky yet the plot line about being redeemed by the love of a good woman is the same . Mr . Lucky was one of RKO's biggest hits that year and it's clear that they knew what they were doing by not letting Cary Grant remain a heel . Try as he may , Grant had a lot of difficulty in getting studios to see him as anything other than the good guy . Eventually he surrendered to studio wishes , whatever studio it was . Besides those mentioned , Mr . Lucky also has good performances by Charles Bickford as the boat captain and amateur surgeon who saves Grant's life and by Alan Carney as Grant's driver and man Friday . It's definitely worth a look when next on TCM .
395823	2483625	36191	8.0	The Fabled Baron	You've got to hand it to that Josef Goebbels . When the little club footed maniac wasn't busy trying to get into the pants of every starlet of the German cinema , his UFA Studios could turn out some good work . Such is the case of the lavish spectacle Munchhausen . The color cinematography and special effects definitely equal the quality of anything Hollywood could do . The Munchhausen Stories in German culture are akin to Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels . The author Rudolf Erich Raspe was trying for Swift like satire of the political events of his time . In time though they became beloved for their face value alone . In fact the protagonist became a synonym , Munchhausen's syndrome is a diagnosis for one who tells exaggerated stories or outright lies the better to ingratiate themselves with another individual or a group . In fact at the same time that German romantic cinema star Hans Albers was doing Munchhausen over in Germany , a different kind of Munchhausen was popular in America . Jack Pearl , a former vaudevillian , had a radio series based on the Munchhausen character and his famous line to those who questioned the authenticity of his stories was " Vas you dere Charlie " . Quite popular back in the day . The story of the fabled Munchhausen is told in flashback during a party in modern Germany by the current Baron Munchhausen . By the way , another reviewer said that it would be Germany in the Thirties before World War II started . Not necessarily because the Nazi regime was notorious for not asking the kind of sacrifices demanded of its civil population until late in the war . Such a lavish type party was definitely in keeping with the regime's culture of the time . Though Goebbels kept it light as he did most of UFA's product except those that were outright propaganda , they did get their shots in . During the part of the film concerning Munchhausen's visit to Imperial Russia , the German background of Catherine the Great played by a fetching Brigitte Horney is emphasized . Catherine was a name she took when she married the Czar , she was in fact Sophia of Anhalt-Zerbst . Also there is a scene when Pugachev , the peasant leader of a revolt in Siberia , is brought in caged like an animal and looking like something from Dr . Moreau's laboratory . Pugachev was later played by Van Heflin in the film Tempest in the next decade . The caricature was definitely in keeping with the Nazi ideas to depict Slavic people as some kind of subhumans , almost as bad as Jews . Throughout the film as Munchhausen travels from St . Petersburg , to Istanbul , to Venice and even the moon , Albers's faithful sidekick is Herman Speelmans who is like Sancho Panza or even Gabby Hayes if you will . Speelmans does a fine job and dies on the moon in a beautifully played scene . As the propaganda is kept to a minimum , Munchhausen has survived to be appreciated on its own merits which are considerable .
393463	2483625	16804	8.0	The Great Profile As The Great Seducer	Although John Barrymore was 44 when he played the role of Tirso DeMolina's famous libertine , the soft focus photography enabled to look years younger and really do a convincing job as the most famous seducer in fiction . In fact Barrymore plays two roles , the dashing cavalier Don Juan and his stern father who was cuckolded by his wife and imparted some cynical views on women to his young son in a prologue . When the main action of the film gets going it takes place in Rome when the Borgias were running things . Cesare Borgia played by Warner Oland and his evil sister Lucretia who has Estelle Taylor , then Mrs . Jack Dempsey playing her part . They're quite a pair , cruel and sadistic , and they've got a cousin played by Montagu Love who rivals Don Juan in the seducing department . Barrymore is ostensibly in Rome as a student , but he's way too busy with his female conquests for any academics . He and Love have their eyes on the same woman , Mary Astor , who is royalty herself , related to the Orsinis who the Borgias have kicked out of power . That rivalry is what fuels the plot of this film . Director Alan Crosland was obviously influenced by Cecil B . DeMille in directing this film . The sumptuous sets and even more the scenes of debauchery could be found in many a DeMille spectacle . And we don't get DeMille's moralizing with the film either . As for Barrymore he plays the part with the dash and verve of Douglas Fairbanks who later got to play Don Juan , but as a much older man in Faribanks's final film during the sound era . Note the dueling sequence with Love . Warner Brothers for whom this film was produced used some of the same bits in their sound version of The Adventures Of Don Juan with Errol Flynn . There is also a nice bit by Willard Louis as Barrymore's lackey , Pedrillo . Sad that he would die the same year as this film came out . He was quite amusing in the role . Still it's Barrymore's show and quite a show it is . Don Juan is a good chance to see a young John Barrymore at the zenith of his acting talent .
393216	2483625	35979	8.0	Henry Van Cleave , You've Had A Wonderful Life	At the top of the list of Don Ameche's best films , in that first five , Heaven Can Wait is always listed . As a film with that inimitable Ernest Lubitsch touch , how could it miss ? The very dapper an elegant Mr . Henry Van Cleave has arrived at the entrance to the underworld where he feels given the risqué life he's led on earth , he feels he belongs . To convince the Prince of Darkness , Laird Cregar , that he should be his guest for eternity . And he tells him his life story to prove his case . We see Don Ameche at the various stages of his life during this film and the picture we get of him is a very decent man , but one who could not resist a pretty face or a pretty ankle , depending on which order he noticed them . Nevertheless he does meet the girl of his dreams , Gene Tierney , and while she kept him on the straight and narrow , it wasn't without a look here and there to the side . Some of Hollywood's favorite character actors show up in this film which is one of the reasons it's such a favorite . It's hard to pick from a cast that includes Signe Hasso , Spring Byington , Marjorie Main , Louis Calhern , Eugene Palette , Allyn Joslyn , and Charles Coburn any particular favorite . But I'd have to say my favorite is Laird Cregar . There has never been a more cultivated or civilized Satan on the screen before or since . Cregar's performance more than anything else is symbolic of the Lubitsch touch . Heaven Can Wait is an interesting commentary on our system of morals . Don Ameche's character is absolutely sure he's going to hell and if you listened to fundamentalist ministers he sure would be . Apparently for Laird Cregar's place though , if you spread some happiness in life you certainly don't qualify for admission . An interesting criteria , don't you think . Don Ameche is charming , Gene Tierney is beautiful , the script is witty and bright , the direction faultless . Can't do better than that .
393056	2483625	25493	8.0	Jeanette's In No Mood For A Banker	When Jeanette MacDonald left Paramount and signed with her new studio of MGM it was her wish that she not do any more films with Maurice Chevalier . Though the three films she did for that studio with him were very successful , the two of them did not get along at all . She thought he was a rake , he thought she was frigid . So imagine her chagrin when she learned that her first MGM film , The Merry Widow which has some great songs for a soprano she would be co-starred once again with Chevalier . He wasn't exactly thrilled either , it was known he was hoping to do the film with Grace Moore . But they both went back to work for Ernst Lubitsch who had guided them in The Love Parade and One Hour With You . Lubitsch got the best out of them , especially Jeanette . There are some who say her work at Paramount with him is far superior to anything she would do at MGM , even with Nelson Eddy . Jeanette's the richest woman in the tiny kingdom of Marshovia , her taxes bankroll the kingdom . But she's bored there and cynical about all the men courting her for her money . The king and queen of Marshovia , George Barbier and Una Merkel , want to keep her Marshovian money in Marshovia so they send the most romantic guy they know , captain of the guard Maurice Chevalier as Count Danilo who cuts quite a romantic figure and romantic swath among the ladies . Of course he falls in love , but he's still got a roving eye and in his own way Maurice is as cynical as Jeanette . It will take some doing to get these two together . The Merry Widow had its American premiere on Broadway in 1907 and ran for 416 performances . The basic numbers of the score that Franz Lehar wrote are retained . My favorite is one of the best operetta numbers ever written for a soprano , Vilia . Jeanette sings it beautifully as she does the famous Merry Widow Waltz . And who could sing about the joys of courting Girls Girls Girls while hanging out at Maxim's than Maurice Chevalier ? Lubitsch does a grand job at getting some real comic moments out of Edward Everett Horton as the Marshovian Ambassador in Paris who together with Herman Bing . I do so love the scene where Bing is translating the diplomatic codes for Horton with the king's editorial comments . Chevalier and MacDonald never worked together again , but they certainly went out on a high note ( no pun intended ) with The Merry Widow .
392972	2483625	24962	8.0	That Catherine Was Great and Popular	Although Marlene Dietrich was a far more glamorous Catherine the Great , closer to the real one was definitely Elizabeth Bergner in this British production from Alexander Korda . The former Princess Sophia of Anhalt-Zerbst , one of many small pieces of turf in Germany before that country became a country instead of a geographical expression , pulled off something unique in history . She came as a promised bride to the tsarevitch who in this case was Peter , nephew of the Empress Elizabeth of Russia . Through her own will and genius for intrigue , this Queen Consort , without a drop of royal blood of Russia in her , got to rule Russia and well for over 30 years after deposing her husband . Woman must have done something right . The film here like the one in Hollywood ends with the deposition and death of the Czar and Catherine taking over . We don't see the regal , confident , and promiscuous empress Catherine was to become . We see her as a shy and overwhelmed German Princess who grows in her role as her husband won't in his . Catherine grows in her character as Elizabeth Bergner does in this part . Sam Jaffe as Peter is far closer to the mark of the real character of that unfortunate soul than Douglas Fairbanks , Jr . is in this film . Yet Fairbanks gives an extraordinary performance , far from the swashbuckling parts that his father patented on the silent screen . In fact both the Fairbanks were in the UK at the same time . Fairbanks senior gave his farewell screen performance in the Private Life of Don Juan and his son did about seven films for four years of which this is probably his best effort . The pleasure loving Empress Elizabeth as done by Flora Robson is light years different from Queen Elizabeth in Fire Over England and The Sea Hawk that Robson did later , but still very nicely done . Alexander Korda perfectly captured the mood and feel of old Romanov Russia as taken over by a usurper , a popular one , but still a usurper .
395753	2483625	28315	8.0	Shirley Finds A Family	1936 was a breakthrough year for Alice Faye for two reasons . First this was when stopped being 20th Century Fox's platinum blond answer to MGM's Jean Harlow . But Darryl Zanuck did her a big favor when he hired the songwriting team of Mack Gordon and Harry Revel away from Paramount and for the next five years they were practically Alice Faye's personal composers . Nearly all the succeeding films she did had a Gordon-Revel song in it and after Mack and Harry split up , Gordon continued to write with Harry Warren as a partner for 20th Century Fox . Gordon in fact put more words in Alice Faye's mouth than any other lyricist . Gordon and Revel wrote a couple of songs for this Shirley Temple film Stowaway where she unites Alice Faye and Robert Young to become her new parents . The setting is China though they never got anywhere near the real Kuomintang China for this film . Shirley's an orphan who's being raised by some missionaries in place of her parents who were also missionaries . When bandits are threatening the mission , Shirley's sent to Shanghai . But Willie Fung to whom she's entrusted skips out on her and leaves her and her Pekinese dog stranded . But our little moppet is resourceful and she charms playboy Robert Young and later Alice Faye who's engaged to both Allan Lane and his mother Helen Westley . That's right Lane and Westley are definitely a package deal . It's a Shirley Temple film so any of you who are fans of her's know exactly how things go here . Gordon and Revel wrote for Stowaway my favorite ballad of their's and one of the best movie songs ever done , Goodnight My Love . Alice even got to record this one . First Shirley sings it and then Alice does it as an adult obbligato with adult lyrics . It was one of Alice Faye's best loved movie songs though the real hit record was done by the Benny Goodman Orchestra and a new vocalist he had hired , one Ella Fitzgerald . You can't go wrong with either recording . Helen Westley also does well as the prospective mother-in-law from hell and my favorite in the supporting cast is J . Edward Bromberg who after Shirley testifies at a divorce hearing , refuses to grant a divorce for Young and Faye . It's one of Shirley Temple and Alice Faye's best films and even today you will love how orphan Shirley finds a family that she has to put together .
395145	2483625	41948	8.0	Training the First Generation of Top Guns	Task Force was the first of two films Gary Cooper made regarding the development of aviation . Here he plays the fictional Jonathan Scott who looks back on his life after retiring from the Navy . The second is the Court Martial of Billy Mitchell where he plays the real life Army Aviation pioneer . For today's fans if one wants to see where Tom Cruise and the gang from Top Gun all got their start , take a look at Task Force . The idea of a floating flattop ship from where airplanes could take off and land was one that was scoffed at post World War I . Pilots didn't have the skills yet for that . What Task Force shows is Gary Cooper and a whole bunch of other people who believed in an idea living and dying to prove that idea . Task Force was memorable in the career of Gary Cooper for two other reasons . It was the first film he did after leaving his original studio , Paramount , at Warner Brothers where he worked for about five years . It was also the last film he did with good friend Walter Brennan . They made eight joint film appearances , including some memorable ones in The Westerner and Sergeant York where they got Oscars , Brennan for The Westerner and Cooper for Sergeant York . Jane Wyatt is Cooper's leading lady , playing the part of the faithful wife where if this had been made at MGM , June Allyson would have had the part . She's the widow of one of Cooper's early Navy flier friends who is killed trying to land on a new aircraft carrier . Director Delmar Daves made good use of actual combat footage both black and white and in the last 15 minutes color . Lent a real air of authenticity to what we were viewing . Look for some good supporting performances from Brennan , Wayne Morris , Bruce Bennett and the best being an obtuse United States Senator played by Stanley Ridges . The final shot of the film shows Cooper now in civilian attire with jets passing overhead . That was a whole new skill that had to be learned by the next generation of Top Guns . Very graphically demonstrated in The Bridges at Toko-Ri . I'd like to think that Tom Cruise and the rest of the cast of Top Gun saw those two films and realized the great heritage they were now going to portray .
394353	2483625	103074	8.0	A Feminist Classic	A pair of bored thirty something friends decide on a girl's weekend and in that time become the most wanted women in America . Not that bedding either Susan Sarandon or Geena Davis hasn't got its delightful aspects , but that's not the kind of wanted I'm talking about . The film is shot in some of the reddest part of red state America where gender roles and rules are laid down real specific and you don't cross them . Just these two women going out without husband or significant other partner of the opposite sex means they're loose and available . So when alpha male Timothy Carhart decides after some line dancing at a county honky-tonk that Geena's hot to trot , he decides to do something about it in the parking lot . And if she resists he certainly knows how to bring her in line . But when Sarandon pulls a gun on him he backs down very reluctantly . In fact Carhart's defiant attitude and assumed male superiority snaps something in Sarandon and she blows him away on general principles . After that they're on the run . Sarandon and Davis work beautifully together in Thelma & Louise . Close friends before the homicide takes place , they learn a lot about each other on the journey . They air out finally the way they feel women have been treated in their part of the country . Though I wouldn't recommend women act out quite the way they do , the film remains a great feminist manifesto . Harvey Keitel does a fine job as a caring police officer who wants to bring them in with no problems and before they run up a real criminal record . Christopher McDonald and Michael Madsen are the men in their lives , both in their different ways clueless as to what is going on inside Thelma & Louise . Just the fact they wanted a girl's vacation should have lit up some bulb . McDonald , Madsen are just two of the men these two get to degrade and humiliate on their merry race with destiny . One however that gets the better of them is Brad Pitt in his breakthrough role as a young cowboy they find hitchhiking and give a lift to . Despite their new found feminism , Sarandon and Davis are still quite vulnerable in some areas , as are we all . Callie Khouri won an Oscar for Best Screenplay written directly for the screen . Thelma & Louise got five other nominations including for both Sarandon and Davis for Best Actress . They split the balloting as is what usually happens and Jodie Foster took her second Oscar home for Silence Of The Lambs . Thelma & Louise is destined to be a classic and a feminist manifesto for generations .
394197	2483625	41907	8.0	Everybody's got their own agenda	Joel McCrea , Douglas Kennedy , and Zachary Scott are partners in the Three Bell Ranch in Texas as the Civil War starts . When war does come it splits the partners up . The ranch is raided by Victor Jory and his cutthroats and the partners are wiped out . Kennedy opts for enlisting in the Confederate Army . McCrea and Scott decide to go into gunrunning to make enough money to re-stock the ranch . McCrea makes enough , but Scott likes the profits and he wants to keep on gunrunning . As you can see the three partners all have different agendas . In fact everyone in this movie is working on his own agenda . The female leads Alexis Smith and Dorothy Malone have a hankering for McCrea . Victor Jory rides for the Union the Confederates and for himself . Bob Steele who's a slimy sort that Scott recruits in the gunrunning business has his own plans . Believe it or not it all jells into a very nice plot and is good entertainment . Joel McCrea was his usual stalwart hero as was Douglas Kennedy . Zachary Scott was no better than he had to be on any occasion . It's a good western and I wish it was shown more often .
392895	2483625	70511	9.0	Butterfly Man Of Devil's Island	Watching Papillon today it occurred to me that the film it most resembles is Birdman of Alcatraz . Both Steve McQueen and Burt Lancaster were sent to prison for murder convictions although allegedly McQueen was innocent . Both were based on true characters who wrote , in the case of Lancaster ghost wrote , their own memoirs of their time in the joint and the films are based on those books . And certainly both men were rebel spirits . In Lancaster's case it's an internal rebellion against the rules of the penal system . Of course in the work he did developing those bird remedies , he rehabilitated himself in a way that ' the system ' did not understand . But in the case of Henri Charriere aka Papillon for the butterfly tattoo on his chest , he just wants out of the penal colony at Devil's Island and makes many attempts to get shed of the place . The film is about his many attempts and his refusal to quit no matter what is done to break him . Devil's Island in the Thirties was not any better than it was when Alfred Dreyfus was doing his time in the tropical prison . Still McQueen is resourceful enough as you will see . McQueen though he's far from French has the rebel persona that really fits this part . Had he been younger and this been a French production I could have seen Jean Gabin in the role . It's one of McQueen's best roles and he holds your interest throughout this nearly three hour film . Leading an impressive supporting cast is Dustin Hoffman who plays what we would now call a white collar criminal . He becomes a devoted acolyte of McQueen seeing he's going to need friends himself if he's to survive Devil's Island . He also wants to escape in the worst possible way . Later on we see Hoffman in a different light as if completing the Birdman of Alcatraz analogy , Hoffman's role is similar to that of Telly Savalas who's a tough character when we first meet him in Birdman , but later becomes acclimated to prison life . Hoffman has worked himself into a nice situation relatively speaking on the Island and has resigned himself that this is his home for better or worse . It's a very good performance by Hoffman as his character changes during the film . I'd really recommend seeing both Birdman of Alcatraz and Papillon back to back . It's a good prison doubleheader for a rainy afternoon .
394265	2483625	252501	9.0	An Unusual Fugitive	If anyone is looking for some typical Stephen King fare with lots of blood and vividly imagined monsters , Hearts of Atlantis is not your film . If however your taste runs to well acted drama about growing up in the early sixties Hearts of AAtlantis is definitely the film for you . Although it's not stated my gut tells me that this tale is somewhat autobiographical . David Morse comes back to the small town he grew up in to attend the funeral of a friend killed in action , presumably Kuwait during Desert Storm . He also learns that his first girl friend also passed on a few years earlier . They were a trio that hung out and did things together as kids . Morse's mind wanders back to those innocent days when Anton Yelchin as young Morse , Will Rothhaar as the man who was killed as a youngster and Mika Boorem as the girl friend are all of eleven . Yelchin lives with his mother Hope Davis , a woman made bitter by the split between her and Yelchin's father . Into their lives comes a mysterious boarder whom Davis takes in because she needs the money , but remains suspicious . The stranger is Anthony Hopkins and he and Yelchin form a bond . Hopkins is a fugitive , but not in the usual sense . As we discover he's got powers and abilities far beyond those of ordinary men which are in the mind reading field . It's a gift and a curse and Hopkins is wanted by some mysterious strangers who want to make use of his abilities . Presumably this is the Central Intelligence Agency . Hearts in Atlantis is a tender and loving film that is made by the performances of Anthony Hopkins and the juvenile cast around him . Best scene in the film is Hopkins defusing a confrontation between Yelchin and friends and a school bully played by Timothy Reifsnyder . Hopkins reads Reifsnyder and tells him things about himself he would not want known , but they do ring true and play into the pathology of bullying . This is an absolute must see films , one of the best screen performances by Anthony Hopkins on film .
394535	2483625	60934	9.0	A Primer On Sino-American Relations	If The Sand Pebbles had been filmed ten years earlier it might have been called From Here to Eternity Goes to Sea . Like the James Jones novel it's protagonist is a loner type who finds a sense of purpose and order in the military . As Robert E . Lee Pruitt loved bugling and boxing , Jake Holman loves his engines . He's real happy to be on board the naval gunboat San Pablo , nicknamed Sand Pebbles , because he is the engineering staff and he takes real pride in making the naval vessel perform . Also kind of like Eugene O'Neill's Yank in The Hairy Ape . But Steve McQueen as Jake Holman , probably THE rebel character he ever played in film , finds his life getting increasingly complex by America's mission in China between the two World Wars . In 1911 China overthrew the Manchu dynasty which in its weakened state over the last century had sold off parcels of real estate outrightly controlled by European powers and later by Japan as well . The United States controlled no territory outright as other powers did , but we did insist on extraterritoriality involving our citizens doing business there . What that meant was that our citizens were not subject to Chinese laws , civil or criminal , matters involving them went to American courts . Other powers had those same treaties . That was resented , westerners were resented , Japanese were resented most of all because they were fellow Asians doing it to the Chinese . But in this story we are concerned with Americans , particularly our missionaries who viewed China as one vast mission field for Christianity . Missionaries like all people come in different shapes , sizes and intelligence . Some of them really did contribute positively to China . But when westerners began being resented , missionaries were included with the rest . Two such would be Larry Gates and Candice Bergen . Candice plays a sincere young lady who heard a church talk and filled with romantic religious notions about saving the heathen in China volunteered to go there . She and McQueen bond in the same way that Monty Clift and Donna Reed do in From Here to Eternity . But Gates is a fascinating character . He's a very knowledgeable man , quite versed on the current political situation in China . Yet he's absolutely blind to the fact that he's in grave danger . It's a peculiar thing about some liberal types , they have great insight into the terrible wrongs done in the past . But at a certain point when guns start firing , buildings start toppling , we can't worry about political , economic , and social abuses of the past . You have to defend yourself and as vigorously as possible . Still it's McQueen's film . As I said he's a rebel hero , but the military doesn't exactly favor individualism . His captain , Richard Crenna , is a by the book sailor who also doesn't understand the forces of resentment around him , but will not see his ship disgraced in any way . He and McQueen don't hit it off from the start . There's a touching side story involving Richard Attenborough and a Chinese woman , Marryat Andriane who do the unthinkable and get married . Oriental women are for shacking up with , but not to be brides . They find no acceptance in either society and meet a Sayonara like end . McQueen's performance was one of eight Oscar nominations The Sand Pebbles got including Best Picture , Best Director for Robert Wise , Best Supporting Actor for Make as the coolie who McQueen bonds with and who also finds no acceptance in either society . Unfortunately this was McQueen's only Oscar nomination and The Sand Pebbles had the misfortune to be up against A Man for All Seasons . In fact The Sand Pebbles took home nary a statue . Yet viewed today , The Sand Pebbles is a primer for one who might want a visual as to Sino-American relations in the last century . And a great performance by Steve McQueen for his legion of fans .
394006	2483625	70355	9.0	Harry Callahan's Back On The Job	At the end of Dirty Harry , Clint Eastwood throws a way his badge and ID after ending the life of that evil piece of protoplasm Scorpio . The intention obviously was like High Noon when Gary Cooper just threw away the marshal's badge after killing four Miller brothers , Eastwood was quitting the San Francisco PD . Well he must have thought better of it because Harry Callahan became such an iconic figure that the public wanted him back on the job . So Eastwood made the first of four sequels in Magnum Force . Somebody is doing a great job in reviving the vigilante tradition of San Francisco with a string of assassinations , starting with the opening sequence of a shooting of a labor / racketeer who massacred a rival and his whole family . Shades of the United Mine Worker's Tony Boyle and what he did with Joseph Yablonski . A pimp who murders a prostitute who was withholding on him , there's another massacre at the house of a drug dealer , it's getting open season on criminals . His supervisor Hal Holbrook hates his guts , but there's no one like Harry Callahan for these kinds of cases . Mitchell Ryan who's an old friend of Eastwood plays a cop falling apart at the seams and he looks good for it . And there's a group of four sharp shooting rookies on motorcycle patrol , Tim Matheson , David Soul , Kip Niven , and Robert Urich . Any one of them could be our vigilante . In a way Magnum Force is the polar opposite of Charles Bronson's Death Wish films . Bronson's pretty good at selecting some of the right kind of criminal scum to eradicate , but doing this seems to offend Eastwood although Deity only knows , this has been his game for a long time . There's a nice climatic sequence with an unarmed Eastwood dealing with the responsible party for all of this . Magnum Force is every bit the equal of Dirty Harry in action and violence . In the end as Clint's famous tag line in this film says , it turns out that Dirty Harry was dealing with a man who did not know his limitations .
393424	2483625	52357	9.0	Detective Obsessed	Although it got at best mixed reviews when first released , Vertigo is now considered one of Alfred Hitchcock's classic films . A tribute to the players , the director , and the composer of that haunting musical score that will stay with you forever . The music is probably more important here than in most films , let alone most Hitchcock films . Because for most of the first half of the film and a great deal of the second half , it is without dialogue . In fact Kim Novak does not have a spoken line until about 48 minutes into the little more than 2 hour feature . She's under James Stewart's surveillance and the whole story of his growing obsession with her is told through his facial expressions and through Bernard Herrmann's music . Stewart is a cop retired on disability who is hired by an old college friend Tom Helmore to follow his wife . Helmore tells Stewart a tale about his wife falling under the spirit of her dead great grandmother who committed suicide . The wife he's following is played by Kim Novak . Novak in fact makes a suicide attempt and by jumping into San Francisco bay and Stewart jumps in and saves her . In a brief prologue the reason for Stewart's disability is told . While on the police force , he lost a man while pursuing the suspect in a rooftop chase . Another cop was killed trying to save Stewart who had slipped and was hanging on to a roof gutter for his dear life . After that Stewart acquired an understandable fear of heights with accompanying dizziness , vertigo . Later on at an old mission which has significance for Novak's family , Novak runs up to the top of the bell tower and Stewart because of his Vertigo can't pursue her to prevent her from jumping off and taking her life . Later on he spots Kim Novak again with a different color hair and this time essentially stalks her until they meet . By now he's totally obsessed with the dead Novak who he fell in love with . Alfred Hitchcock is plumbing some depths of the human psyche in Vertigo . Certainly good old all American Jimmy Stewart would not be one you would think of casting as a voyeur and a stalker . But he pulls off the performance in probably the film with the least dialogue Alfred Hitchcock ever made since sound came in . Kim Novak is hauntingly beautiful in Vertigo , she has to be or the whole plot would make no sense . Barbara Bel Geddes is in this also as Stewart's girl friend who finds herself losing him to an obsession with a ghost . She also serves as a sounding board for Stewart as he expresses some of his feelings to her . This was the first of two films Stewart and Novak made together . Ironically enough the second one , Bell Book and Candle , is about a witch played by Novak who actually uses witchcraft to ensnare Stewart . Given Stewart's obsession with Novak in Vertigo , if Hitchcock had thrown in witchcraft into the plot , the audience would certainly have believed it . Of course this is an Alfred Hitchcock film and therefore not all is as it seems . I can't sat any more , but there are no happy endings for anyone in this haunting film .
395914	2483625	105323	9.0	A Generation Gap Of Values	In Scent of a Woman Young Chris O'Donnell at the Baird Prep School on a scholarship , has to earn the money he needs for a round-trip back to Oregon to see his family at Christmas break . He takes a job posting off a bulletin board at school advertising for a companion to a blind man . The blind man turns out to be Al Pacino whose sister and her family want to unload him so they can go away for Thanksgiving . Pacino is no helpless invalid however . He's a former lieutenant colonel in the army and used to being obeyed on command . But he's facing a crisis in his life , he's just tired of being an invalid and dependent on people . O'Donnell's having a crisis too . Headmaster James Rebhorn feels he and another student , Philip Seymour Hoffman , saw an act of vandalism committed on the school grounds . It goes against O'Donnell's grain to be an informant . But these other kids , Hoffman included come from old money and can buy their way out of most things . If the ax has to fall as Pacino tells him , it's going to fall his way . The film is a touching story involving a generation gap of values that is bridged when Pacino and O'Donnell discover a genuine respect and affection for each other . Pacino's iconoclastic retired Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade finally won for him an Oscar for Best Actor that his peers had not voted him , despite being nominated 7 previous times in both the lead and supporting categories . In fact that same year Pacino was also up in the Supporting Actor category for Glengarry Glen Ross . Chris O'Donnell had a breakout performance as the young preppie who has far more integrity than his richer and more privileged classmates . And Philip Seymour Hoffman is great as the kid who rats under the financial umbrella of daddy's millions . Scent of a Woman is a great part for Al Pacino , not my favorite role for him . That one for me is . . . . And Justice For All . Still this award like the one given to Paul Newman for The Color of Money is more for Pacino's lifetime of artistic achievement in the cinema . And that's one artistic life anyone could envy .
394057	2483625	43338	9.0	A Thousand Dollar Day Newspaperman	It took twenty five years , but when Paddy Chayefsky wrote and scored a critical and popular success with Network it went a long way towards redeeming Billy Wilder and Ace in the Hole from the critical and popular drubbing it took in reviews and at the box office . The cry then was that Wilder was way too cynical and in the height of the superpatriotic McCarthy days maybe he was for that time . Perhaps Kirk Douglas's Charles Tatem would find employment as a writer at UBS for Howard Beale's mad prophet of the air or at Fox News or if your tastes run the other way , scripting one of Michael Moore's documentaries . Kirk Douglas is a veteran reporter who's been fired off a whole lot of newspapers and arrives in Albuquerque looking for a job . Editor Porter Hall after an interesting job interview hires him . Two months later , a bored Douglas and cub reporter Robert Arthur are sent on some nothing story and on the way learn of a man , Richard Benedict , trapped in an old cave with a broken leg . Remembering the real Floyd Collins story from the Twenties about a Kentucky man trapped in a cave for 18 days while America followed every move of the rescue attempt , Douglas smells a return to the big time . With the aid of a corrupt sheriff , Ray Teal , Douglas starts controlling the story and indirectly making the story . Of course things get out of hand . Kirk Douglas has never been afraid of being seen as unlikeable on screen and in Charles Tatem he's at his most unlikeable . In fact until he did There Was A Crooked Man in 1971 , I'm not sure he's ever been this big of a canine descendant . He's matched every step of the way by Jan Sterling who plays Benedict's tramp of a wife who wants her cut of the proceedings and takes it out of Douglas literally . Ace in the Hole was made when newspapers still were a major source of news . Televisions were still scarce and I don't think it's an accident that Billy Wilder chose a sparsely populated state like New Mexico as the setting . Television sets in the Rocky Mountain states in 1951 were scarcer than the people . I think Ace in the Hole could be remade today , maybe with Michael Douglas taking over an internet news blog to bring it up to the times . Still Billy Wilder's magical cynical touch would be missing .
396733	2483625	53221	9.0	" You Can Do Just About Anything You Want To , Chance . "	Howard Hawks initially wanted to reunite John Wayne and Montgomery Clift who had worked so well together in Red River in his second film with Wayne . Clift however was at the beginning of the slide that would ultimately destroy him in seven years and said no . It was then that Dean Martin was cast as John Wayne's alcoholic deputy . By the way if Clift had done the part it would have reunited him with Walter Brennan also who is playing a very similar part to the one he did in Red River in relation to Wayne . In the wordless beginning of Rio Bravo , Wayne while going into the town saloon to fetch Dino , witnesses a cold blooded killing perpetrated by Claude Akins . Akins is the no good brother of rich rancher John Russell who keeps trying to spring Akins from Wayne's jail . He also brings in some hired guns who bottle the town up . Both Howard Hawks and John Wayne absolutely hated High Noon and made Rio Bravo as their answer to it . This sheriff doesn't go around begging for help from the townspeople he's sworn to protect . He's supposed to be good enough to handle the job himself with some help from only a few good men . Dean Martin said that the Rio Bravo role for him was one of the most difficult . At that time he was playing a drunk on stage and was not yet into the substance abuse problems that beset him later on . But turns in a stellar performance . This film marked the farewell feature film performance of Ward Bond who took some time from his Wagon Train TV series to play the small role of a Wayne friend who offers to help and gets killed for his trouble . Fitting it should be in the starring film of his best friend John Wayne . The only bad note in Rio Bravo is that of Ricky Nelson who is too much the nice kid from Ozzie and Harriet to suggest being a young gun . But Rio Bravo marked the first of many films Wayne used a current teenage idol to insure box office . Later on Frankie Avalon , Fabian , Bobby Vinton all the way down to Ron Howard in The Shootist brought a younger audience in for the Duke . James Caan who played the Ricky Nelson part in El Dorado was much superior to Nelson . Then again , Caan is an actor . But I will say that Dean and Ricky sung real pretty . When you hear Dean singing My Rifle , Pony , and Me in the jailhouse , you might recognize the same melody from Red River as Settle Down . Dimitri Tiomkin wrote it and Dean recorded it as well as the title song for Capitol records . At Capitol Dino did mostly ersatz Italian ballads , it was what he was identified with . When he switched to Reprise , Dino started doing far more country and western and it really starts with the songs he did in Rio Bravo . Rio Bravo is a leisurely paced western , probably one of the slowest John Wayne ever did . But Howard Hawks created some characters and a story that hold the interest through out .
393206	2483625	35586	9.0	A Lifetime of Service To His King And Country	I finally got to see The Young Mr . Pitt , a film I had wanted to see for decades . Mainly because Robert Donat perfectly fit my conception of what William Pitt , the Younger was like . In that I was not disappointed , Pitt is definitely one of Donat's best screen performances . William Pitt , the Younger 1759-1806 was the second son of William Pitt , the Earl of Chatham . As he was the second son , he did not inherit the earldom , but he did inherit his father's name and in British history , he is probably one of the five greatest individuals ever to be their Prime Minister . And he became Prime Minister at the ripe old age of 24 and held that office for most of the rest of his life . Although certain things were left out , what was in the film stuck pretty close to the facts . When Pitt turned 21 he entered Parliament in 1781 and the following year , Lord Frederick North , the Prime Minister who lost the American Revolution was finally kicked out . There was a bit of jockeying for power and several governments were formed over the next two years when George III got the idea to ask young Pitt to take the job . He managed to win the next elections and was master of Parliament the rest of his life . He also never lost the confidence of his sovereign . Donat captures Pitt perfectly , his only vice was every now and then to drink a bit much . No cheap swill for him though , only the finest of wines did he occasionally overindulge in . His chaste behavior around Phyllis Calvert is also true , it's pretty much established the man was celibate all his life , probably due to a low sex drive , though that's not explicitly gone into . Without family attachments , Pitt's whole life was devoted to the protection and governance of the United Kingdom . He saw the danger of radical Jacobinism from France to British society and the even greater menace of Napoleon Bonaparte . Like FDR and General George C . Marshall reaching down the ranks to get Dwight D . Eisenhower in World War II . Pitt was the man who found Horatio Nelson and gave him command of Great Britain's fleet and who responded with victories at Aboukir Bay and Trafalgar . As Pitt was chaste and aesthetic , his great rival of the period Charles James Fox was a rake and a gambler . Robert Morley gives one of his greatest performances also suitably cast as Fox . My favorite moment in the film is after Aboukir Bay , Fox gets a brick thrown through his window while dining with four lovely young ladies . When one of them asks what this was , Morley drolly replies , ' the voice of public opinion . ' What makes that particular scene more effective is that the next scene cuts to demonstrations against Pitt , calling for a truce in the war . The fickle finger of public opinion very graphically demonstrated . John Mills plays William Wilberforce of whom a film was made about last year to great acclaim . He was Pitt's devoted friend and ally , but Wilberforce's crusade to abolish slavery gets a brief mention in The Young Mr . Pitt and nothing more . What gets no mention at all is King George , III's periods of insanity and the Prince Regent , later George IV is not a character here . The film takes us up to Trafalgar . In real life Pitt died very soon after the battle of Austerlitz which left the United Kingdom bereft of continental allies for several years . Worn in body and spirit , sadly he died without knowing of Great Britain's eventual triumph over the force of despotism . Of course the film was made while the United Kingdom was also going through a great trial against an even greater evil , with another resolute Prime Minister who devoted his heart and soul to his country's service and protection . I'm sure Winston Churchill saw the film as some propaganda against his critics , but I'm also sure that William Pitt the Younger was a role model for him . As Pitt should be a role model for all who put country above all .
394417	2483625	43278	9.0	Experiencing Paris With Gershwin	Gene Kelly came up with some really grand ideas for musicals while with MGM . Here he's at the top of his creative powers working with the Arthur Freed musical unit . Hard to believe when you watch An American In Paris that the players never left the back lot at MGM . The magic of An American In Paris is due to the creative editing under the direction of Vincent Minnelli and the sets that MGM designed blended with some background establishing shots . The idea of the film originated with Kelly who wanted simply to do a film with a lengthy ballet sequence involving George Gershwin's tone poem An American in Paris . It sounded good to Arthur Freed who approached Ira Gershwin who said fine with him as long as they used other Gershwin material . Gershwin got the kind of deal for Gershwin music that Irving Berlin normally got . Not one note of non-Gershwin music is heard in An American in Paris . Listen to some of the background music and you will hear things like Embraceable You and But Not For Me which are not real musical numbers . Another guy who was a fair hand at writing lyrics , Alan Jay Lerner , wrote the story which admittedly is a thin one . All about an ex-GI played by Gene Kelly who after World War II never left France , just settled into an apartment on the Left Bank and proceeded to become a starving artist . He lives with eccentric composer Oscar Levant and does that ever sound like a redundancy . Two women are interested in him . Another expatriate American played by Nina Foch who wants to sponsor him as a painter if he'll reciprocate in other matters . But Kelly falls for a shop girl played by Leslie Caron in her film debut . Caron also has musical comedy star Georges Guetary interested in here . Of course the plot is just an excuse to sing and dance to the music of George Gershwin . An American in Paris happens to be the first film I ever saw as an in flight movie on the first airplane trip I ever took . I still remember flying back from Phoenix Arizona to Kennedy Airport seeing Gene Kelly doing I've Got Rhythm . My favorite number in the film however is Tra-La-La which Kelly sings and dances all over the apartment with Oscar Levant playing the piano . At one point Kelly dances on top of the baby grand piano . In a book about Arthur Freed , I read a quote where he said in the American in Paris ballet sequence was to be done with the background of the French impressionists which he felt the public would take to rather than a realistic setting on the streets or back lot . So it happened that way . Kelly had done lengthy ballet sequences in Words and Music , The Pirate , and On the Town . But this one topped them all . Still does in my opinion and that includes some of Gene Kelly's later films . In a surprise upset at the Oscars , An American In Paris was chosen best picture for 1951 , beating out the heavily favored A Streetcar Named Desire . I guess fantasy trumped realism that year . Big budgets also have an upper hand in these things as well . Still An American in Paris is one of the best movie musicals ever done and since the studios no longer have all that creative talent under one roof , something less likely to be repeated .
393569	2483625	60438	9.0	Something For Everyone , A Comedy Tonight	It's ironic that just as Stephen Sondheim was establishing himself as both composer and lyricist on Broadway , musicals just stopped being made except on rare occasions . As a result most of Sondheim's work is sadly not filmed . In any event we don't have the musical stars on screen to do the roles justice . So in his first effort at writing both music and lyrics we're lucky indeed to have A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Forum on the big screen . A cut down version to be sure in terms of songs , but still a tribute to Sondheim in a fashion . The accent is more on comedy however and you cannot give enough praise to both Zero Mostel and Jack Gilford who were the only two from the Broadway cast to repeat their roles . In fact I can't conceive of A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Forum being made without Mostel . He dominates the proceedings and that's not easy considering his main co-star is Phil Silvers . Phil Silvers was supposed to be on Broadway , but would not do the part on stage because he could not wear his glasses . Those were not just a comic prop , the man was terribly nearsighted . As a result his part was played by John Carradine . Who'd have ever thought those two would have been up for the same part ? Another movie veteran the garrulous Raymond Walburn played the wandering Erronius and his part was played by the great stone face Buster Keaton in what turned out to be his farewell performance . Richard Lester the director comes in for a lot praise as well . The way he maximized the use of the screen you can hardly tell the stage origins of this show . Certainly that wild and crazy chariot race at the end could not have been done on stage . It's a great sequence even if the idea originated in the Eddie Cantor film , Roman Scandals . This movie was also the return of Zero Mostel to the screen after the blacklist . Mostel previously had done some really nice character parts , he stands out in those two Humphrey Bogart films , The Enforcer and Sirocco and was really good as Jack Palance's lapdog companion in Panic In The Streets . But when he could not get work in Hollywood , he returned to nightclubs and the theater where he obtained real stardom . One of the many Tony Awards A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Forum won was for Zero Mostel as Best Actor . On Broadway the show ran for 964 performances from 1962-1964 and also won a Tony for Best Musical . I haven't even described the plot because it's impossible . It revolves essentially around young Hiero , played by Michael Crawford to get the woman he loves who happens to work over at Phil Silvers's pleasure house and his family slave Zero Mostel to obtain his freedom . That's as far as I can go . As another movie icon expressed , fasten your seatbelts , A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Forum is a wild and bumpy ride .
394142	2483625	35417	9.0	Living Justice	The Talk of the Town puts visiting law professor Ronald Colman in a delicate situation . He's rented a cottage for some peace and quiet before going before a Senate committee dealing with his nomination to the Supreme Court . But things are anything , but peaceful in the town of Lorchester , Massachusetts . The factory owned by Charles Dingle has burned down , arson is suspected and Cary Grant in an unusual working class role is the suspected arsonist . He's a man of radical opinions in the town so he's a convenient suspect . As the factory was the main employer in the town you can imagine that folks are crying for blood . Which brings an escaped Cary to that same house that Jean Arthur has rented to Colman . Though there are some amusing moments to be sure from all three of the stars , I find The Talk of the Town to be more serious than dramatic . Grant challenges Colman to come down out of the ivory tower he's been living in and apply his high minded principles to real life , if not necessarily his case . When he does Colman does it with a vengeance and it brings down a whole lot of Lorchester's leading citizens . Though Grant and Arthur are first billed , this film really belongs to Ronald Colman . His character is modeled I believe on a recent Harvard law professor who was also appointed to the Supreme Court , one Felix Frankfurter . Of course what the impeccable English Ronald Colman playing WASP Michael Lightcap and a Viennese Jew have in common is not obvious at first . But before becoming mentor to a host of New Deal civil servants , Felix Frankfurter was not only a professor of law at Harvard , but concerned himself with a host of social issues . He was for instance , very prominent in the defense of Sacco and Vanzetti whose plight in the twenties is very similar to Cary Grant's . Like Colman's character Lightcap , Frankfurter was also known as a man of impeccable integrity , who even his worst enemies conceded . He could also be a bit too high minded at times and had to be brought to realize in his philosophy of judicial restraint , that the courts are and should be an instrument for progress and social change . His story would make an excellent film itself . Although I can't see Felix Frankfurter putting the moves on beauty parlor owner Glenda Farrell to learn the truth about the arson . Farrell who graced many a Warner Brothers crime feature in the Thirties has the best of the supporting roles in The Talk of the Town . Also the ever unctuous Charles Dingle is wonderful as the very corrupting influence on the town itself . Colman's final speech to the mob who are ready to lynch Cary Grant is a masterpiece , one of his best moments on screen . The words ought to be required reading and viewing for those who would dismantle our judicial system out of heated passion of the moment . As a film that challenges folks to live up to the creed they espouse The Talk of the Town should not be missed .
393585	2483625	51496	9.0	A Good Realistic Western	As one of the other reviewers pointed out , this whole film is based on a few lines of an autobiography where the protagonist Frank Harris joins a group of cattle RUSTLERS for a spell . So in fact that as tough as Glenn Ford and his crew are , at least they're on the right side of the law . Also Frank Harris is probably best known for the first definitive life of Oscar Wilde . And Harris like Wilde was born in Ireland . Might have been nice if Jack Lemmon had played him with a brogue . Another reviewer pointed out that Jack Lemmon did not fit into the western film . True enough , but in fact this is the story of a tenderfoot who goes on a cattle drive and has quite the adventure . Still and all Cowboy is a pretty good realistic western about life on a cattle drive . These drovers aren't any kind of heroic , but they do the job that has to be done . Jack Lemmon's ideas about cowboys are taken from the dime novels of the period . He gets rid of his romantic notions , but fast . Among the supporting cast Brian Donlevy comes off best as the world weary former town marshal who joins the drive to get away from his job and meets a tragic end . Cowboy came out in 1958 which was the height of Glenn Ford's career . Ford did some of the best westerns of the 1950s and Cowboy ranks right up there .
393085	2483625	311429	9.0	In Her Majesty's Service	I've found it fascinating over the past 20 years that with the advances made in special effects techniques , comic book heroes have had an explosion in popularity on the screen . The films , good , bad or indifferent seem to make money with a built in market . We seem to get a few of them every year with accompanying merchandise . One I liked very much was based on the idea of combining a whole bunch of literary characters from the 19th century into The League for Extraordinary Gentlemen . Some heroes , some villains , some troubled people all get together in the service of the British Empire to find out just who wants to brew a lot of trouble among the European Powers . It's quite a crew they've assembled , Allen Quatermaine , Mina Harker , Dorian Grey , Captain Nemo , The Invisible Man , Dr . Jekyll and his alter ego Mr . Hyde , and visiting from America Tom Sawyer . They're in for some high adventure , the kind kids eagerly used to read about in the books these people are found in . The League of Extraordinary Gentleman has a kind of infectious charm that I find irresistible . A lot of that has to do with Sean Connery as Allen Quartermaine , fresh from the continent of Africa , and leader of this band . As of today , this film has been the last screen appearance of the man some word argue is the biggest international star the movies have right now . I particularly like the scenes that Connery has with Shane West who plays Special Agent Tom Sawyer of the United States Secret Service . I'll bet you didn't know where Tom Sawyer would wind up when he grew up and left the Mississippi . Seems perfectly logical watching this film . Quartermaine lost a son and buried two wives and he bonds with young Sawyer . He even warns him against romancing Mina Harker , played by Peta Wilson whose vampiric proclivities might be a bit much for a young man to handle . I'm sure The League for Extraordinary Gentlemen got a lot of young viewers going to see it . If any of them get curious enough to read the books these characters are found in , than this film will have done a great service . By the way , the chief villain when he's unmasked is yet another villain found in a series of classic books from that time period and one of the recruited league in fact is a traitor . I won't say , you'll have to buy or rent the video / DVD .
394104	2483625	86720	9.0	First In War , First In Peace , First In The Hearts Of His Countrymen	To take that imposing figure come down to us from Gilbert Stuart's famous portrait and turn George Washington into a flesh and blood human being was quite the achievement . I watched this and the succeeding mini-series about Washington and came away thinking I actually knew the man . I think the credit goes to two people . First the source of this mini - series is James Thomas Flexner's authoritative biography on Washington . I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to know about our first president and what went into the shaping of his character . The book is eminently readable and Flexner writes so that even a non-historian can appreciate Washington . The second is Barry Bostwick's performance as Washington . It's not easy to make someone who's attained near mythological status into a flesh and blood human being , but Bostwick succeeds brilliantly . His life and loves are told from early manhood through to the end of the American Revolution . Martha Washington is ably played by Patty Duke . During our revolution at any number of given points the colonial army could have been snuffed out if British commanders had made different and better choices . Washington endured a few victories , some defeats , but he kept his army intact and in being until the advantage that made that final victory at Yorktown in 1781 presented themselves . He also had to endure a lot of criticism of his leadership from some elements of the Continental Congress . In fact one should see this together with 1776 and get an idea about the American Revolution from both the military and civilian leadership perspectives . In the supporting cast I enjoyed James Mason in one of his final roles as British General Braddock who Washington served under during the French and Indian War . It's there where Washington got his baptism of fire in the woods of western Pennsylvania . This is the 18th century equivalent of what the Indians did to General Custer . Washington was lucky to escape that day and Mason does in good job in portraying a very brave , but incredibly stupid general . I would also single out Jaclyn Smith as Washington's first love , Lady Fairfax and Jose Ferrer as Virginia colonial Lieutenant Governor Robert Dinwiddie who gave Washington his first military command in the French and Indian War . George Washington is good drama and good history . Anything you want to know about the first American president can be learned here .
394379	2483625	36515	9.0	Vagabonds For A Cause	Watch On The Rhine started as a Broadway play by Lillian Hellman who wrote the film and saw it open on Broadway at a time when the Soviet Union was still bound to Nazi Germany by that infamous non-aggression pact signed in August of 1939 . So much for the fact that Hellman was merely echoing the Communist party line , the line didn't change until a couple of months later . Lillian was actually months ahead of her time with this work . The play Watch On The Rhine ran from April 1941 to February 1942 for 378 performances and five players came over from Broadway to repeat their roles Frank Wilson as the butler , Eric Roberts as the youngest son , Lucile Watson as the family matriarch and most importantly villain George Coulouris and Paul Lukas . Lukas pulled an award hat trick in 1943 winning an Oscar , a Golden Globe , and the New York Film Critics for Best Actor . Probably if the Tony Awards had been in existence then he would have won that as well . The Oscar is even more remarkable when you consider who he was up against , Humphrey Bogart for Casablanca , Gary Cooper in For Whom The Bell Tolls , Mickey Rooney in The Human Comedy , and Walter Pidgeon for Madame Curie . Every one of his competitors was a bigger box office movie name than he was . Lukas's nomination is usually the kind the Academy gives to round out a field . Jack Warner knew that which is why Mady Christians did not repeat her Broadway part and the role of Lukas's wife was given to Bette Davis . Davis took the part not because this was an especially showy role for her , but because she believed in the picture and just wanted to be associated with it . It's the same reason she did The Man Who Came To Dinner , a much lighter play than this one . Davis is the daughter of a late American Supreme Court Justice who married a German national back in the Weimar days . After many years of being vagabonds on the continent of Europe , Davis Lukas , and their three children come to America which has not yet entered the European War . They're made welcome by Lucile Watson who is thrilled naturally at finally meeting her grandchildren . The fly in this ointment are some other house guests , a friend of Davis's from bygone days Geraldine Fitzgerald and her husband who is also from Europe , a Rumanian diplomat and aristocrat George Coulouris . Coulouris is a wastrel and a spendthrift and he smells an opportunity for double dealing when he suspects Lukas's anti-fascist background . His suspicions are quite correct , it's the reason that the family has been the vagabonds they've become . Lukas fought in Spain on the Republican side and was wounded there . His health has not been the same since . His family loyally supports him in whatever decision he makes . Those decisions affect all the other members of the cast . Adding quite a bit more to the Broadway play including some lovely fascist creatures was Dashiell Hammett who was Lillian Hellman's significant other . Coulouris playing cards at the German embassy was a Hammett creation with such loathsome types as Henry Daniell , Kurt Katch , Clyde Fillmore , Erwin Kalser and Rudolph Anders . Coulouris is truly one of the most despicable characters ever brought to screen as the no account Runmanian count . He was a metaphor for his own country who embraced the Nazis with gusto and then equally repudiated them without losing a step after Stalingrad . Lucile Watson was up for Best Supporting Actress in 1943 , but lost to Katina Paxinou in For Whom The Bell Tolls . Dashiell Hammett was nominated for best adapted screenplay and the film itself lost for Best Picture to that other anti-fascist classic , Casablanca . Though it's an item firmly planted in those specific times , Watch On The Rhine still packs a stern anti-fascist message that bears repeating infinitely .
392734	2483625	51776	9.0	Missionary / Innkeeper	This film concerns the life and achievements of one Gladys Aylward , a Christian woman from Great Britain who conceived early on that her place in the world was in China . She was a remarkable person who let absolutely nothing deter her in her calling . That included a lack of formal education , no support at all from any accredited missionary group and no money of her own . She worked as a maid to get the money to get a one way ticket to China with only an address of an aged female missionary who needed a young assistant . This film marked Ingrid Bergman's complete return to our fickle public's favor . After the scandal of her affair with Roberto Rosellini and her divorce , the public would not accept her in saintly roles like Joan of Arc and The Bells of St . Mary's . But winning her second Oscar two years earlier cemented her comeback from Europe and this part restored her in our fickle public's affections . We'd never get away with casting her as an Englishwoman today , but she overcomes any accent problems with unbridled talent . She soon inherits the whole mission when Athene Sayler dies . And she supports it by working as a foot inspector for the local mandarin . In those days of the twenties among other things the Kuomintang government was trying to do was undo the Chinese custom of footbinding females at a young age so they would have petite feet . It met with a lot of local resistance , but she proves up to the task . The title of the film comes from the idea that Athene Sayler had . Not to open up a formal church as such . Instead she wanted to open an inn in which travelers could stop and hear stories for entertainment . No television in those rooms . The stories they heard were those of the Bible . It was Sayler , Bergman , and their cook Peter Chong who ran the place and soon it was Bergman and Chong . If Bergman's casting seems bizarre by today's standards , the casting of Curt Jurgens as a Chinese Kuomintang Army Colonel is worse . Jurgens's occidental features are written into the script making him bi-racial , Dutch father and Chinese mother . He's a man with little convictions about spiritual matters , except he comes to believe in Bergman , in her innate decency , her dedication to his people , and what she's trying to accomplish . The mandarin is even more bizarrely cast . The part calls for an asthetic actor so they got the best around in Robert Donat . This was Mr . Donat's farewell performance , he died while the film was still in theaters . No one would get away with that casting today , but Robert Donat is also that good a player . I'm sure if the film were remade today , we'd have real oriental players like Russell Wong for the Colonel and James Shigeta for the mandarin and maybe someone like Kate Winslet for Gladys Aylward . But would it be as good as this film ? The subject of missionaries and the good they do is one hotly debated topic . It does take a certain amount of brass to go to a given place and tell everyone your belief system is all wrong . I suppose the best way to lead is by example and Ingrid Bergman as Gladys Aylward set the best example she could . In fact she did one thing most missionaries , good or bad , wouldn't consider . She gave up her British citizenship and became a Chinese citizen . The film was helped a great deal by the inclusion of that children's song This Old Man where Ingrid tries to teach her youngest charges some English with it . It was enormously popular back in the day and Mitch Miller's record of it was heard constantly . The climax of the film and what gave Gladys Aylward her place in history is that trek with a hundred orphans away from the advancing Japanese army . A remarkable achievement indeed from a remarkable dedicated woman who wouldn't listen to anything , but what was inside her soul .
395868	2483625	34862	10.0	Bing was a marketing genius .	Finally Paramount gave Crosby a big budget musical and didn't rely on his charm and personality to carry the film . The budget went to hire such outside talent as Fred Astaire and Irving Berlin . And none of them disappoint . In the first of two films Astaire and Crosby did together the characters are remarkably the same . Astaire is the elegant and charming show business professional who's ambitious for success . Crosby is the talented , but lazy partner who just wants a life of ease and comfort and not to work more than he has to . Small wonder that their double act broke up . But now enter a complication . They both get interested in the same girl who in this film is Marjorie Reynolds . Crosby dreams up the idea of a nightclub / hotel called Holiday Inn where they only work on holidays . He wants Reynolds to help with the shows there . Astaire wants her for his act after his other girl partner Virginia Dale runs off with a millionaire . And the fun starts . Now since this was Crosby's home studio and he's first billed , just who do you think gets Reynolds in the end ? As maid Louise Beavers put it , don't sit and mope because some slicker stole your gal . Irving Berlin writes a majority of new songs to supplement a couple from his vast trunk of songs mostly about our holidays . By that time Berlin had extracted an agreement which became standard for all the films he wrote for . Not one note of non-Berlin music is ever heard in a score he writes . Just listen to this and just about any other film Berlin is associated with . Even music in the background is his . The hit song in this was supposed to be Be Careful It's My Heart , the Valentine's Day song , sung by Crosby and danced to by Astaire and Reynolds . It did have a good deal of success . But the success of White Christmas was exponentially phenomenal . It netted Irving Berlin his one and only Academy Award and for Bing Crosby his number one item on vinyl . In fact everyone's number one item on vinyl . I don't know if Bing Crosby ever set out to become the voice of Christmas , but if he did he was a marketing genius . If he's known and appreciated for anything with today's audience , it's for that . White Christmas became the first Yule song he was identified with although he had recorded some Christmas material before that . After this he started doing the holiday music in serious . Just think , along around Columbus Day , record companies even now reissue his Christmas stuff every year and his totals as largest selling recording artist in history grow once again . That's why the Beatles and Elvis , etc . don't have a prayer of overtaking him . In fact White Christmas's initial success was so great that Decca wore out the original master putting out records to meet the demand . So in 1945 , Decca got Bing , the Ken Darby Singers and John Scott Trotter to re-record it almost note for note . The original 78 had White Christmas with the flipside of Let's Start the New Year Right also from Holiday Inn . The newer version which most people hear has as it's flipside God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen . I don't want to ignore Fred Astaire's contribution here . He does a nice comic turn with I Can't Tell a Lie , the Washington's birthday number where Crosby keeps changing the tempo to upset him and Reynolds . The Fourth of July yields a number for each . Reynolds is kept from the show by Bing's machinations and Astaire has to " improvise " something . He " improvises " Firecrackers and anyone who knows anything about Astaire knows how hard he worked to get that spontaneous feeling in his dancing . Bing sings The Song of Freedom , reminiscent of James Cagney's Grand Old Flag number from Yankee Doodle Dandy also out in 1942 and Song of Freedom is also reminiscent of what Paramount could have given Bing in the 1930s had they hired someone like Busby Berkeley to give Bing some of the production numbers that Dick Powell had at Warner Brothers . So what more is there to say , but sit back and enjoy the fun .
394933	2483625	34891	10.0	" God Bless This Ship And The Men Who Serve In Her "	It's ironic indeed that in Noel Coward's greatest screen role he played a part so atypical of what we expect from that most witty and erudite of artists . There's a lot good in In Which We Serve , but if you are expecting Coward bon mots , skip this film . Whatever else Coward was , he was one patriotic British citizen who loved his country and wanted to do his bit in World War II . The incident in which In Which We Serve is based on what actually happened to the the destroyer HMS Kelly in 1941 off Crete which was sunk after taking a few of the enemy with her . The ship was commanded by one Louis Mountbatten of the royal family and a good friend of Coward's . Coward's character while not a member of the royal family is still of the upper crust of British society . Mountbatten when war broke out used his considerable royal connections to get into a combat assignment when war broke out . The sequences in which Coward's ship is sunk and the actions of Coward and the crew hews pretty close to what happened to Mountbatten and the men of the Kelly . While we Coward and his survivors clinging to life rafts and bits of wreckage , the audience gets a series of flashbacks revolving around three men , Coward , CPO Bernard Miles , and Seaman John Mills . We see them at peace and at war with the women they are involved with who are Celia Johnson , Joyce Carey , and Kay Walsh . This was total war for Great Britain , something until I don't think Americans could fully appreciate . While the men are at sea , the women live under threat and fact of bombardment by air . Their scenes are every bit as important as the battle scenes at sea , showing a people totally mobilized . In small roles you can find such people as James Donald , Michael Wilding , and Richard Attenborough all part of the crew . Attenborough in particular makes a vivid impression in his part . The Earl of Mountbatten made a series of televised memoirs in the early seventies that didn't reach American television until after his assassination in 1979 . It was about 10 episodes and they dealt with all facets of his career . Before he retired in fact he became the First Sea Lord of the British Navy . But one episode dealt with the sinking of the HMS Kelly and the men of the Kelly who survived year after year got together for a remembrance . Some footage was shown of one of the gatherings . I wonder if they still do that and how many men are left from the ship survivors . In fact it's altogether fitting and proper that this review be dedicated to Lord Louis Mountbatten who not without controversy served his country well and faithfully throughout a long a productive life . And of course this review is also dedicated to the brave men of the HMS Kelly , those that have passed on and those who might still survive . They and the other members of the Royal Navy kept their country from invasion for almost a thousand years and in the case of World War II kept the world from a totalitarian nightmare . And they couldn't have a better film than In Which We Serve to perpetuate the memory of their deeds .
395180	2483625	53125	10.0	" War Is Hell , Even When It's A Cold One . "	Following up on his two previous masterpieces , The Thirty Nine Steps and Saboteur ; Alfred Hitchcock put together his ultimate chase film with elements of both coming into Ernest Lehman's screenplay . I've seen figures that show in terms of box office and later video sales and rentals , North By Northwest was Hitchcock's most successful film financially . At this point Alfred Hitchcock's name over the title could sell a movie , but I'm sure he didn't mind having Cary Grant in it to draw the movie going public . This was Cary's fourth and final appearance in a Hitchcock film and I think it is his best performance in one . Like in the two films I cited , Cary is innocently caught up in a web of intrigue and he got there by just answering a telephone page at a hotel dining room . He took a call right after someone paged a George Kaplan and the bad guys think he's Kaplan . And he gets grabbed . It's a devilishly difficult situation for him because there ain't no George Kaplan . He's a fictitious guy who was invented by one of our spy agencies ( that's never identified in the story ) to take the heat off an agent very close to masterspy James Mason . Mason tries to murder Grant by getting him drunk and putting him behind the wheel of a car . Later on Grant gets framed for murder while trying to find out what's going on and he's on the run from New York to Chicago to Rapid City and the Mount Rushmore monument . James Mason plays the cultured villain Philip Van Dam . Mr . Mason who had some of the most precise diction heard this side of Ronald Colman on screen , could play villain and hero and a lot in between equally well . Among other things he's a bi-sexual and his henchman / boyfriend Martin Landau is jealous of his involvement with Eva Marie Saint . With the Code still firmly in place , it was quite daring for Mason to refer to Landau's suspicions as his ' woman's intuition . Eva Marie Saint joins the list of cool and fiery blonds Hitchcock was so partial to for his films . I'm surprised he never used Eva Marie again , she seemed the perfect successor for Grace Kelly who if she hadn't become a princess would have been playing this part for sure . Bernard Herrman who wrote the acclaimed score for Hitchcock's Vertigo followed that up with an equally good score . Especially during the moments of Grant's tangle with a crop duster plane and the chase across the Mount Rushmore Monument , Herrman made great use of music to help the audience feel the tension . It's a great instrumental piece , violins that seem to pound with a drum counterpoint . The best kind of film music . And why wouldn't it be because North By Northwest is some of the best kind of film making .
394611	2483625	35575	10.0	Red White and Blue , Cagney for You	James Cagney won his only Oscar for his recreation of George M . Cohgan in Yankee Doodle Dandy . Already terminally ill , Cohan lived long enough to see the film and no doubt he would have approved of it because it sure is how he would like to have been remembered . In 1942 when Yankee Doodle Dandy premiered there was a whole generations of people left alive who saw George M . Cohan perform . Watching the film today Cohan is like a figure from antiquity . But Warner Brothers was lucky to have James Cagney with the studio who's dancing style closely paralleled Cohan's . If it is ever run on Turner Classic Movies , make sure you see George M . Cohan's sound film The Phantom President . You will be astonished to see how closely Cagney captured his style . In the same way that Philip Seymour Hoffman captured Truman Capote and Joaquin Phoenix became Johnny Cash . Cohan's contemporaries are also like names from antiquity . But a century ago when Cohan was just hitting the big time performers like Fay Templeton , Nora Bayes , and Eddie Foy were very big stars and in 1942 plenty of people saw them also . I wish we had some film of them to see how Irene Manning , Frances Langford , and Eddie Foy , Jr . did in their recreations . I'm sure Foy , Jr . did a smashing job with his Dad . The background stuff is true enough . Cohan was born to a pair of vaudeville performers Jerry and Nellie Cohan played here by Walter Huston and Rosemary DeCamp . Later on a sister was added to the Cohan family and here Josie Cohan is played by Jeanne Cagney . They did do all the towns , big and small , in America . Cagney meets wife Joan Leslie at Shea's Theater in Buffalo , New York and Shea's survives to this day . And his first real success was Little Johnny Jones which score included American classics , Yankee Doodle Dandy and Give My Regards to Broadway . What's left out is the fact Cohan had two wives . His second wife survived him and died in the early Seventies . As his songs became popular in patriotic / rightwing circles , Cohan's personal politics reflected that . He fought hard and lost in the battle for Actors Equity . Cohan thought a union of players was tantamount to Communism . But such was his standing among performers that Cohan was granted the unique privilege of being allowed to appear on stage without having to join Equity once the union was recognized as the bargaining agent for players . Cohan is shown in Yankee Doodle Dandy as gracefully having retired when other trends in popular music took over . Far from it , he was a very bitter man and when he did that final comeback in I'd Rather Be Right he fought with Kaufman and Hart over the book and Rodgers and Hart over the songs . But Yankee Doodle Dandy presents the public musical face of George M . Cohan and does it very well . To this day , some forty years after first seeing Yankee Doodle Dandy on television , I love the recreations of Yankee Doodle Dandy , Give My Regards to Broadway , and You're a Grand Old Flag as they were first seen on stage . Plus some of the snatches of the lesser known Cohan songs as performed by the players portraying the Cohan family and others . When all is said and done , George M . Cohan was a great force of nature in the American musical theater . And we thank his father , mother , and sister , and George M . himself for what he left us .
393923	2483625	71562	10.0	The Continuing Saga Of The Corleones	Although most movie sequels never equal the original this is certainly not the case of The Godfather : Part II . Many would argue it surpasses the original . With both films declared the Best Picture by the Motion Picture Academy in their separate years , I'd hate to argue the difference . In this case we should thank the executives at Paramount for retaining both director Francis Ford Coppola and the original The Godfather author Mario Puzo to put their talents to this film . I'd hate to think what would have happened in other hands . Certainly these two men knew their characters and knew how to expand on them . And the best thing about The Godfather : Part II is that one can pick up the story , at least the modern portion of this one without reference to the original . In fact viewing this film will give you a burning passion to see the first . Unlike The Godfather and The Godfather : Part III , this film runs on two parallel tracks . The modern story is a continuation of Al Pacino as Michael Corleone now residing on the shores of Lake Tahoe and now directing the family affairs from Nevada where the Corleone family is heavily into gambling as we well know organized crime was back in those days of the Fifties and Sixties . He's going into partnership with Lee Strassberg playing Hyman Roth , a thinly veiled portrait of Meyer Lansky . But there are a lot of things making Pacino hesitant about this move into Cuba under the Battista dictatorship . The prequel parallel story is how young Vito Corleone came to this country as an orphan and worked his way up to establish himself as a crime boss . Here Coppola does a brilliant job in capturing the flavor of pre-World War I New York in the Italian ghetto . Robert DeNiro is young Vito Corleone and won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar . Remarkable when you consider that two of his rivals were Lee Strassberg from this film and Michael V . Gazzo playing Frankie Pantangeli from this film as well , the Mafia kingpin turned Senate witness modeled on Joe Valachi . DeNiro and Marlon Brando have the unique distinction as players of winning an Oscar for playing the same role . The woman do better in this film as in the original . Talia Shire got an Oscar nomination in the Supporting Actress category as Connie Corleone Rizzi . You remember her husband betrays the family and is killed in the original . She now is a drunken dependent on Pacino . Diane Keaton's character of Kay Adams Corleone is expanded here as well . She's a cultural outsider and the Sicilian vendetta code that she's expected to approve without comment becomes too much to bare . Her scene with Pacino when she tells him she's leaving him is one of the best for both in their respective careers . Overlooked unfortunately at award time was John Cazale as Fredo Corleone . He's the middle son who's passed over for succession after eldest son James Caan is killed in The Godfather . Fredo's big moment in The Godfather is being unable to fire his weapon in defense of his father being shot and how he breaks down . Fredo's got feelings as John Cazale dramatically points out . He does something really stupid in this film and it costs him dear . Cazale has some of the best moments in this film . If the first Godfather film doesn't do it , The Godfather : Part II will have you permanently hooked on the inner workings and dynamics of the Corleone family both in the criminal and personal sense .
393965	2483625	59742	10.0	One of Our Favorite Things	I was fortunate enough to see The Sound of Music on Broadway with the original cast minus Mary Martin , her part had been taken over by Martha Wright at that point . The production was good , but the thing I like best about The Sound of Music was how well Robert Wise transferred it to the screen . I defy anyone to show any trace of stage origin in this magnificently photographed film from that aerial opening with Julie Andrews singing the title song to the end with the Von Trapp family climbing every mountain . The main difference between the stage production and the screen version is that the role of the Baroness Elsa Schrader played by Eleanor Parker is a singing role . With the casting of Ms . Parker , a talented player but no singer , certain songs out of necessity had to be eliminated . Eleanor is fine in her role , but I do wonder if Robert Wise meant to cast a singer in her part originally . On Broadway the Baroness was played by Marion Marlowe . Julie Andrews who became a Broadway star in My Fair Lady and Camelot and didn't do either role for the screen , gives her greatest screen performance in a Broadway role originally written for someone else . There was some criticism that Mary Martin was too old to be playing Maria in the original play , but she certainly was guaranteed box office on Broadway . Julie Andrews was just right for the part and she's in great voice . I always marvelled listening to her at the perfect diction she was able to maintain hitting those high notes . Christopher Plummer took over the role that Theodore Bikel on Broadway and he too gained a signature role for his screen career . I've always felt that the talented Mr . Plummer has never been given the credit due him . He was a perfect Duke of Wellington in Waterloo and his portrayal of Commodus in The Fall of the Roman Empire is the highlight of that film . I like Christopher Plummer because he's also never taken himself seriously though he takes his art very seriously . I don't think too many other actors today could have played that comic villain in the Tom Hanks / Dan Ackroyd Dragnet movie and done it with such obvious zest and enjoyment . A real old timer got into this film with Peggy Wood playing the Mother Abbess at the Convent where Maria is a postulant . Ms . Wood's Broadway career dates back to 1911 and on stage she introduced songs by such people as Victor Herbert , Jerome Kern , Sigmund Romberg , and Noel Coward . You've got to be real good to get folks like that to write for you . And now her art is preserved in one of the most popular films of all time . The charm of the music and the leads and the kids sometimes obscures the anti-Nazi message that The Sound of Music conveys . The story takes place in Austria before and during the Anschluss . Christopher Plummer makes no secret of disgust for the Nazis and all they stand for . The Sound of Music makes it clear he is very much in a minority in terms of Austria uniting with Germany . Of course the irony is that Anschluss did not quite turn out for the Austrians as they hoped it would . The Sound of Music , it's story , it's music , it's lyrics and it's charm will stay with you and never leave after a hundred viewings .
394225	2483625	59749	10.0	The Dirty Business of Espionage	The Spy Who Came In From the Cold is one of the few Richard Burton vehicles that he did without Elizabeth Taylor in the sixties . Some might argue it is the greatest film performance of his career and I'd be hard pressed to disagree . Taken from the John Le Carre novel , The Spy Who Came In From the Cold is a grim , realistic look at the world of espionage . No glamor , no gadgets involved , no derring-do to save the world , just people trying to acquire information illegally on both sides . The black and white photography in this film gives it a noir like quality and the performances are from a perfectly cast group of players . Headed of course by Richard Burton . He's a man over 20 years in the espionage game , but he knows no other life . Offered a desk job , he refuses and instead gets a dirty mission trying to bring down a crack East German intelligence agent . Burton when he gets the job uses true believer Communist Claire Bloom to gain entry as a defector to the Eastern bloc . Once in East Germany he cleverly plays off rivals in the Communist camp Oskar Werner and Peter Van Eyck against each other . Werner is of Jewish descent and Van Eyck is a former Nazi , so there's history between them that Burton cleverly exploits . Werner and Van Eyck are perfect in their roles . Richard Burton received another Oscar nomination for Best Actor , but lost to Lee Marvin for Cat Ballou . Cat Ballou is a funny film , but I don't think Marvin's performance in any way ranks over Burton in this . Of course Burton probably took consolation in the fact that Sir Laurence Oliver was up for Othello at the same time and he lost . One of the worst decisions ever made by Academy voters . The Code was getting a bit loose in this one and while there are no sex scenes , even in a film where part of Burton's mission was to seduce Claire Bloom . I guess this is the closest The Spy Who Came In From the Cold gets to James Bond . But one thing was also there and that was the performance of Michael Hordern as the explicitly gay man who makes contact with Burton as a supposed defector . Gay was almost invisible during the hey day of the Code and now gay characters were emerging on the screen . Claire Bloom's character is truly one of the most tragic ever put on the screen . It should serve as a warning to starry eyed idealists of the Left and how they can be exploited by their own people and those they are opposed to . In the years after Germany has been reunited , The Spy Who Came In From the Cold stands as a reminder of how dirty the Cold War could get .
