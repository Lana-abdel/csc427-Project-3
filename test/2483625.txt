395874	2483625	96149	1.0	There was a mutiny at the drive-in when this was shown	On it's own Space Mutiny is bad enough , but I unfortunately saw it immediately after viewing the latest Star Wars endeavor from George Lucas so I got to compare it to a really good science fiction film . Poor Cameron Mitchell and John Philip Law respected actors that they are handled things differently . Mitchell just looked like he was about to throw up , I think that's why they gave him that obviously fake Santa Claus beard , to try to hide his discomfort . Now Law , just overacts outrageously as Kalgan , the leader of a mutiny aboard a futuristic Babylon Five . His dastardly plan is to take over and sell the people on board into slavery with some space pirates he deals with . During the course of the movie he borrows from Sir Laurence Olivier torturing Dustin Hoffman in Marathon Man . The hero and heroine Reb Brown and Cassandra Cissie will never be confused with Lord Oliver and Vivien Leigh . In fact old Reb ain't as good an actor as the Governator of Calleefornia . But he does look attractive enough in his sleeveless undershirt which he wears throughout most of the film . One scene that totally cracked me up was Brown and Law battling it out with those futuristic bumper carts . But it ain't enough reason to see this film or buy the video .
396029	2483625	34902	2.0	It's Not Easy Dealing With An Invisible Agent	When a bunch of Nazis come calling on Jon Hall at his print shop in New York City , they seem to know all about him and the background he has tried to hide . Seems as though an ancestor of his was none other than Claude Rains who as John Griffin invented that invisibility formula that had the entire United Kingdom on edge . Hall barely escapes from the agents who include Cedric Hardwicke for the Nazis and Peter Lorre as a visiting ally from Japan . Right after Pearl Harbor like Wonder Woman , Hall decides his talents are best put to use in the Allied Cause . His condition is that he alone will be given the invisibility drug , mindful of the bad side effects it has including causing the madness that killed Claude Rains back in the day . Hall finds out some vital information , like the day the Axis is going to invade the USA and who their agents are in America . He has the help of the beautiful Ilona Massey , but he's not quite sure what side of the fence she's playing . The Nazis are stupid , even more stupid than usual in these films , but they've also got a lot of intrigues going among each other , between Cedric Hardwicke and J . Edward Bromberg to see who will be top dog under Himmler in the S . S . And Peter Lorre does not think terribly much of German efficiency and with these two around who could blame him . Maybe the Japanese ought to gain the secret of invisibility and they might be calling the tune in the Axis . It all makes for one horrific wartime propaganda flick that would be hooted off the screen by some and would offend others . Peter Lorre who was Jewish Hungarian , gets to do his Mr . Moto act with malevolence saying such things as you occidentals have this really big fetish about your white women and Hall coming back that he can't tell any of you monkeys apart . To be fare to Hardwicke , Lorre , and Bromberg , it's not easy dealing with an invisible man . Too bad they were at war with the British or they could find out how Claude Rains ultimately met his end .
394810	2483625	419946	2.0	Vince McMahon Has No Shame	After the first 10 minutes or so of The Marine when John Cena after singlehandedly rescuing three fellow Marines from Al-Queda execution in the best Sly Stallone / Arnold Schwarzenegger fashion and then got himself a discharge for his trouble for disobeying an order , I knew this one was going to be a Thanksgiving treat . As we learned from Clint Eastwood in Heartbreak Ridge , the Marines do value initiative . Anyway the rest of the film has him unable to adjust to civilian life and then his and wife Kelly Carlson's path cross that of a gang of murderous crooks at a filling station who take Carlson hostage . Bad mistake guys . If you are a fan of the Schwarzenegger / Stallone school of action flicks , you know exactly what the rest of the film is all about . One bright spot in this film is chief villain Robert Patrick's performance . He is well aware of what a clinker this film is and he may cop the award for the most over the top , outrageously overacted performance of 2006 . And of course all the explosive pyrotechnics are nicely done as well . Vince McMahon of the World Wrestling Federation and a man who has no sense of embarrassment as he proves time and again produced The Marine . John Cena of course had to lose the WWE title to get several weeks off to film this thing . It may lead to a career in action films . Cena's got the body of a young Governator and no German accent either .
396661	2483625	910936	2.0	A Couple Of Stoners Turn Rambo	Don't look for anything to terribly sophisticated in Pineapple Express . In fact the nuggets of humor to be mined here are few and far between . Maybe I'm old fashioned , but the notion of a minor league drug dealer and his number one customer as heroes is just a bit bizarre for my taste . But that's what happens when Seth Rogen after making a purchase of some really primo grass called Pineapple Express , just fresh on the market , he sees a murder committed by a big drug lord , Gary Cole and his girlfriend , policewoman Rosie Perez . That telltale roach he left behind leads Cole and Perez to dealer James Franco and they spend the rest of the film running for their lives . Until the very end when they turn Rambo and all the drug traffickers in two gangs get dealt with severely . And I certainly don't see anything remotely humorous in these two lugnuts looking for traveling money , selling some of this really good marijuana to school kids . But what do I know and I reached maturity in the Sixties .
396851	2483625	112817	3.0	Finding Meaning In The Obscure	Well maybe I'm just a Philistine but I certainly have to dissent from all the rave reviews this film has gotten . It happens I like my westerns traditional , John Ford , Howard Hawks , Delmar Daves , Burt Kennedy , those guys make westerns . Jim Jarmusch makes weird . So does Johnny Depp who I salute for having the artistic courage to play an incredible variety of roles . I love what he did in Edward Scissorhands , Nick of Time , and in the Pirates of the Caribbean series . But he came up short in playing William Blake , the guy who is not the famous English poet . This William Blake travels west spending every dime he has on a promise of a job keeping books for a metal works company owned by Robert Mitchum . When he arrives late , he's told the job is filled . He casually drifts into a relationship with a woman and wouldn't you know it , she's the gal pal of Gabriel Byrne , Mitchum's son . Byrne comes in guns blazing and catches Depp and his woman en flagrato . He shoots the woman and Depp shoots him in self defense . No matter , Mitchum's the big he bull of the area and a bounty goes on Depp's head . In the words of that immortal 20th Century philosopher Joe Louis , he can run but he can't hide . Not even with the help of a new found Indian friend in Gary Farmer . A lot of reviewers extracted meaning from obscure things in this film which wanders rather aimlessly with Depp's fugitive status . I extracted nothing , but boredom . But Dead Man might be your cup of tea , it certainly isn't mine .
393501	2483625	43828	3.0	Just what did Ava's Grandma do that was so terrible ?	My Forbidden Past has Ava Gardner as decadent New Orleans belle living with her great aunt Lucile Watson and her cousin Melvyn Douglas . She's got a yen for Yankee doctor Robert Mitchum who is doing research over at Tulane University . They break things off and Mitchum goes away and returns with a bride , slatternly Janis Carter . In the meantime Ava inherits a whole bunch of money from her grandmother who left New Orleans years ago under a cloud . Just what she did is never revealed , but her name is spoken in hushed tones . Whatever she did , she sure got rich at it . It kind of reminds me of The Road to Rio where we never do find out what those papers were that foiled the dastardly schemes of Gale Sondergaard to marry off Dorothy Lamour . As Bing concludes about the " papers " the world must never know . This film was conceived so that Howard Hughes who was crushing out on Ava Gardner big time at that point could get her over to RKO . He paid Louis B . Mayer's price and Mayer apparently threw in Melvyn Douglas . Melvyn Douglas knows full well what a clinker this is so he overacts outrageously in the best Snidely Whiplash tradition of screen villains . He's the best one in the film . My Forbidden Past should come with a warning label that if you manage to sit through this melodrama because you want to find out just what Ava's forbidden past was with grandma , you will be left hanging .
395857	2483625	43626	3.0	Road Gangs for Wayward Youth	Heart of the Rockies is one of two films that Republic Pictures put out with this title . The first was a Three Mesquiteer film with Max Terhune , Crash Corrigan , and Bob Livingston . It was infinitely superior to this Roy Rogers epic . I sincerely hope that this film did not play in any of the prisons because if it did there would have been a riot . The premise of this film is that a crusty local rancher , Ralph Morgan , has been violently against a work camp for young prisoners cutting through his land . Roy Rogers is the chief engineer for the road and the labor he's using is young first offender convicts . The idea behind it is the director of the camp is a former warden William Gould says it's to keep the young guys in the fresh air and away from the hard cases . If the camp closes down the government might actually have to pay civilian workers and the road might never get done . Well it's certainly an interesting take on the penal system and a defense for using convict labor . Of course such films as Brubaker take a much different line . And my idea of a convict road gang is best expressed cinematically by Cool Hand Luke . Anyway Morgan's got troubles in his own house . His niece Penny Edwards has taken a real shine to Roy . And he's got a doubledealing , doublecrossing foreman in Fred Graham who both has something on Morgan and is working his own agenda . I don't expect much from the B westerns and don't usually get it , but this film actually left me aghast . I wonder if Robert Mitchum who actually did time on a road gang ever saw this film and what he must have thought .
395631	2483625	60848	3.0	Maybe the creators were on some of the product	Poppies Are Also Flowers is an all star amalgamation of two previous films on the narcotics trade . Sharp eyed fans of the cinema will spot plot elements from those two Forties era films , To The Ends Of The Earth and Port of New York . Of course both those films were infinitely better . Still a whole bunch of international stars lent their names and got a fat paycheck for this muddled episodic film which tries to make E . G . Marshall an action star . Talk about ridiculous . Best in the film by far are Yul Brynner as an Iranian general and Rita Hayworth as the dope addicted wife of Gilbert Roland who is one of the villains . Roland plays it rather straight and that ever present twinkle that I love in him is missing . The filming was done on actual locations including some of the harder to reach regions of Iran . Of course that was back in the day of the Shah's pro-western government and you can see photographs of the Shah in some of the shots . I also liked Hugh Griffith as I always do with those wild eyes of his , the wildest this side of Jack Elam . Griffith just dusts off his Sheik Ilderim portrayal from Ben-Hur and hams it up to beat the band . There wasn't much else the man could do , he knew he was in a Thanksgiving special .
392996	2483625	25544	3.0	What Mystery Does It Hold ?	Mystery Mountain is a 12 part Mascot Pictures serial where silent movie cowboy Ken Maynard is trying to track down a nefarious criminal called the ' Rattler ' . This dude who when he's not walking around posing as other cast members with life like masks is busy trying to get a feud going between a railroad and a freight wagon outfit that's owned by leading lady Verna Hillie . The railroad is busy digging a tunnel into a mountain where the ' Rattler ' has a vested interest . But sent to get to the bottom of all this is range detective Ken Maynard together with a sidekick , newspaperman Syd Saylor , looking for a scoop as all good newspapermen do . Maynard's horse Tarzan has absolutely nothing on Trigger , in fact I think Tarzan ought to ask for a recount or demand to know when the election was held that named Trigger the smartest horse in the movies . He pulls Maynard's gluteus maximus out of the proverbial sling a few times in Mystery Mountain . In fact Tarzan's the one who finally after 12 chapters identifies who the ' Rattler ' really is beneath those disguises as other cast members and going around in a Phantom of the Opera like disguise for most of the film . I won't give it away , but the hint for the viewer who wants to sit through the four hours of this serial is : think The List of Adrian Messenger and how they nailed Kirk Douglas in that one . By the way do you it's possible that John Huston and the writers who worked on The List of Adrian Messenger got inspired by Mystery Mountain ? If you look at the cast list of Mystery Mountain you will note the names of Gene Autry and Smiley Burnette . Both in fact were brought to Hollywood by Ken Maynard who met them in Chicago when he was doing a personal appearance tour and they were doing radio . This was the second of two serials they did literally learning the picture business , courtesy of Ken Maynard . According to a recent biography of Autry , Public Cowboy Number 1 , when Hollywood had totally abandoned Ken Maynard and he was living in poverty in a trailer park , Gene Autry sent him regular checks until the day Maynard died to keep him literally in eating money . Maynard was not the nicest guy in the world , but at least one man was grateful for a kindness shown . I will say this for Mystery Mountain , at least it did attempt to rewrite history as some serials I've seen did . It's a Mascot film so don't expect too much /
394152	2483625	52131	3.0	Hit The Road Drac , And Don't You Come Back , No More No More No More . . . . . . . . . . . . .	In a better film such as the kind Universal put out in the Thirties and Forties , Francis Lederer might have made an interesting Count Dracula . He certainly had the old world manners of the no account count from Transylvania . But in The Return of Dracula where the world's most famous vampire has gone to seek the blood of the new world , Lederer looks extremely uncomfortable trying to make sense of the crummy dialog he has to mouth . Lederer also has police inspector John Weingraf from Interpol on his trail . The old count's got a taste for young teenage girls as he goes after blind Virginia Vincent and tries to put the bite on Christina Eberhardt , to the chagrin of boyfriend Ray Stricklyn . He's in southern California , he must like them there wishing they all could be California girls . I'd go out and hang 10 rather than sit home and watch Dracula return .
396443	2483625	35218	4.0	Wartime Musical	Private Buckaroo is one of those wartime musicals set in the army where the plot is barely noticeable among the musical numbers . In fact I'm not sure of what the plot was . In fact this one was another of those films to incorporate a top big band into the Hollywood studio system . In this it was Harry James and his Orchestra . Harry's gets one of those letters from FDR that a lot of men between 18 and 45 were getting back in 1942 . But his orchestra apparently thinking they'd have to go out hustle other jobs decides the one that Harry's getting is good enough for them so the whole band enlists . Including Helen Forrest and Dick Foran who are his vocalists . Unlike the patriotic Foran who was a CPO in In The Navy , this Foran has an attitude similar to that of Lee Bowman in Buck Privates . Of course when you're drill sergeant is Shemp Howard it's kind of hard to take the army seriously . Foran's also pursuing Jennifer Holt who is Tim's sister . Also in the film are the Andrews Sisters and Donald O'Connor and Peggy Ryan and that about covers the musical portion of the film . For a 69 minute film they had at least a dozen numbers so you can see the plot barely got in the way . Not to mention there was a triangle involving Shemp with Mary Wickes and Joe E . Lewis . The film that Frank Sinatra made about Joe E . Lewis , The Joker Is Wild is infinitely better than Private Buckaroo . But this certainly is an opportunity to see the real Lewis perform . So if you're a fan of any or all of these folks you might spend some time watching Private Buckaroo . All this Universal classic needed was Abbott & Costello .
394106	2483625	60232	4.0	Don't Chase After This DV	The Chase has one of the best casts ever assembled . At least three generations of Hollywood are represented here from Miriam Hopkins and Henry Hull , to Marlon Brando and Angie Dickinson , and finally to up and coming stars like Robert Redford and Jane Fonda . I'm still trying to figure what all the fuss was about . The film opens with the luckless Robert Redford escaping from a Texas prison with another convict who murders a passing motorist and then takes off stranding Redford . He's guilty even if he didn't do the actual killing . Poor Bob has no luck , his wife Jane Fonda is not staying faithful and true , but she's been carrying on with James Fox , the son of the local kingpin E . G . Marshall . Marlon Brando is the sheriff who people think takes his marching orders from Marshall . He'd like to bring in Redford alive , but for reasons I'm still trying to figure out , everybody has this real hatred for Redford and no one talks of anything else . It all ends rather badly for a few of the cast . Arthur Penn directed Lillian Hellman wrote the screenplay and with the cast they assembled you'd think something better would have emerged . Brando who sometimes is accused of mumbling his lines , does so with a vengeance and looks bored and the rest of the cast follows suit . I don't think Marlon Brando's most devoted fans would particularly like this one . Skip it by if it's broadcast unless you're a stargazer like me .
394346	2483625	79770	4.0	Bleak , Bleak , Bleak	Quintet marks the only venture of both Paul Newman and director Robert Altman into the realm of science fiction . It was said of Newman that he could not do comedy , but he tried until he finally scored a real success in that genre with Slap Shot . But the failure of this film left him gun shy and he never tried it again . This is one of the biggest downer films I've ever seen . It's a futuristic ice age , brought on by who knows what , but presumably it's a nuclear winter . Even during the ice age of thousands of years ago , the equatorial parts of the earth still sustained animal and human life , but apparently not here . Seals have survived and Paul Newman is a seal hunter on the outside . But hunters do need a little R & R and Newman goes to a futuristic city where things are so boring the natives have some kind of game played with six people and it's a kind of Russian roulette . To win you have to kill five other participants in your game . It's a sad turn to see what man has come down to . Which is one of the reasons I just could not get into this story . The atmosphere is bleak , the story is bleak , the people are bleak , it's all so bleak . No wonder this thing came up short at the box office . It's a film that just about everyone thinks is never going to be on the top ten list of Paul Newman films , including me . This is man's future , what a bummer .
394509	2483625	43899	5.0	Melodramatic Fantasy	Many a man might give up just about anything for a tumble with Ava Gardner . But what would Ava give up , would she give it all up for a man she truly loved ? That questioned is answered if not to everyone's complete satisfaction in Pandora and the Flying Dutchman . Ava's character of Pandora Reynolds , cabaret singer and jet-setter is a trial run for her later role of Lady Brett Ashley in The Sun Also Rises . She's a cool one Ava , one guy commits suicide over her , Nigel Patrick trashes a perfectly good car to prove something to her , even Harrold Warrender who has a sort of Van Helsing like role is not immune to her beauty and charm . But the guy who's really taken with her is James Mason , the legendary Flying Dutchman . He's been cursed for about 300 years to sail the seas in search of a woman who would lay her life down for him . He gets to port once every seven years to search and he's put in on the northern coast of Spain this time . The color photography by Jack Cardiff is nice , the scenery is almost as beautiful as Ava . But I think for this film to work , a more innocent type rather than the worldly Ms . Gardner would have to have been written into the story .
394055	2483625	43812	5.0	Cleaning Up The Docks	After Broderick Crawford won his Oscar for All the King's Men , Columbia Pictures put him into a potboiler called Cargo to Capetown . AFter that he did the second role that is identified with him on screen in Born Yesterday . After that one , Harry Cohn once again gave him a potboiler noir about a police lieutenant going undercover to clean up the docks . In the beginning of the film Crawford happens to be on the scene of a murder and when the actual killer flashes a badge at him , Crawford lets him go . Turns out the deceased was a key witness in a mob investigation . Instead of hanging him out to dry with Internal Affairs which would be what really would happen as all devoted watchers of NYPD Blue know , Crawford is assigned to go undercover to ferret out the mysterious boss of the rackets plaguing the docks . Call me picky , but I would think the last guy they would send undercover would be another material witness to a homicide . Yet that's what happens here . The premise is so dumb , I can't give this film a higher rating . But in fact The Mob is blessed with an incredible cast of name players just starting out . Neville Brand , Richard Kiley , Ernest Borgnine , even an easily recognizable Charles Bronson who has only one line of dialog are all in this film . Fifteen years later this cast would have cost Columbia Pictures a small fortune and wouldn't be wasted on a black and white B film , souped up for Broderick Crawford . If you're expecting On the Waterfront , don't be looking at this film .
396679	2483625	34961	5.0	The Rabbit Man And The Star	Part of the premise of The Lady Is Willing is that the famous can get away with anything . Picture if you will yourself who while the police are investigating reports of a baby abandoned in a boardinghouse , just up and taking the infant . That would probably land you in jail for a stretch . But for Marlene Dietrich , famous musical comedy star , everyone is just forgiving as all heck and let's her keep the little tyke . Everyone except the IRS who is insistence that she be solvent . Unmarried or not doesn't seem to be the issue . She owes a lot in income tax . So she persuades pediatrician Fred MacMurray to marry her . That would certainly save on doctor bills . As for Fred who wouldn't want to marry Marlene ? But when they enlarge their living quarters it's for cages for rabbits . MacMurray is doing research and needs them for experiments . He's also got an ex-wife sniffing around in the person of Arline Judge . She's more trouble than the rabbits . The Lady Is Willing just will never be ranked as one of the 10 best for either Fred or Marlene . It makes so little use of MacMurray's comic talents which I find very strange . As for Marlene , there are times in the film when she comes across more like Doris Day . Best in the film might possibly Marlene's girl Friday Aline McMahon . She has the film's best lines . But fans of Fred and Marlene should like it well enough .
396920	2483625	95357	5.0	What I Did For Love	When Rob Lowe decided to wear his glasses for real in this film ( in real life he's quite nearsighted ) I think it was his and director Peter Bogdanovich's homage to Cary Grant in Bringing Up Baby . Would that Bogdanovich had as good material as Howard Hawks had with Grant and Katharine Hepburn . Rob's a near do well here , living at home with mother Jessica James and brother Ira Heiden and sometimes whomever mom's current boyfriend is , in this case it's Harry Carey , Jr . in one of his very few roles not in a western . Rob gets a jury duty notice and like most of us , he considers it one royal pain . But when he's chosen for the jury trial of Colleen Camp it's an opportunity he's been waiting for since grade school . Back in those childhood years he was crushing out on Camp big time and now she's on trial for attempted murder . I wrote a review for 12 Angry Men in which I said the film was flawed because of what Henry Fonda did , going to the accused's neighborhood and buying a switchblade similar to the murder weapon . That was absolutely nothing compared to what Lowe does while he's not deliberating on the evidence to prove the object of his affection is innocent . The film has its moments , but I'd have to say it was more silly than funny . Colleen Camp is not quite Katharine Hepburn , though Lowe does give a good try at a Cary Grant type comedy part . Still fans of Rob Lowe will like it .
392740	2483625	53109	5.0	Singing And Dancing On the Waterfront	James Cagney in his autobiography said that he never ran his old films at home with the exception of the musicals . Those he ran continuously and he regretted he didn't do more of them . Which is probably why towards the end of his film career he decided on a musical which had a certain amount of potential , but went sadly awry . Labor Unions were a big news back in the day . The hearings held by the McClellan Committee in the Senate made the doings of the Teamster's Union presidents , David Beck and Jimmy Hoffa front page headlines . There were any number of exposes showing how organized crime was muscling into honest unions . The Taft-Hartley law was a perennial issue back then with Democrats wanting to repeal it and Republicans staunchly in favor . The songs by Allie Wrubel and Maxwell Anderson were singularly unmemorable and the comedy in Never Steal Anything Small is forced . However James Cagney is such a dynamic performer that he's put over far worse . Roger Smith who played a straight arrow lawyer was a protégé of Cagney's back then . He played Cagney's son in Man of a Thousand Faces and after this film with a plug from Cagney to his old boss Jack Warner got cast in the television series 77 Sunset Strip . My favorite in the film is Cara Williams . She's got the part that Joan Blondell or Gladys George would have played opposite Cagney back in the day . Williams is a worthy successor to both those women . There is one true incident in Never Steal Anything Small . At one point Cagney nearly gets acid thrown in his face . There was just such an incident involving columnist Victor Riesel which was more successful and left him blind . But Riesel was a far more noble character than the one Cagney plays here . Though in the end Cagney does show he has some scruples where women are concerned .
393256	2483625	25822	5.0	An Interesting Experiment	Though the role of Trigger Hicks in Spitfire turned out to be disastrous commercially for RKO and did nothing to help the career of Katherine Hepburn , it's still an interesting experiment when seen today . Especially seen by fans who regard Kate as a feminist icon . Trigger Hicks is about as far as you can get for a role from the most well known graduate of Byrn Mawr in history . Kate's an illiterate hillbilly lass who is a mountain faith healer , respected by many and feared by more for her alleged powers . Two who don't fear here are a pair of engineers sent to the Ozarks to build a railroad , Ralph Bellamy and Robert Young . Hepburn unfortunately falls for the married Young who of course doesn't tell her of his marriage to Martha Sleeper . In her own way Trigger Hicks is as much an independent spirit as Tess Harding or Pat Pemberton or any of the other more sophisticated women that Kate later portrayed . I'm sure she thought of the film as expanding her range a bit even though it didn't quite stretch in that direction . Still it's interesting to watch .
395938	2483625	26097	5.0	Little Caesar on the Barbary Coast	I love the story about Sam Goldwyn who said that he bought the rights to the title , Barbary Coast , and then said to the writers hired to write a story with that title . They gave him a story that made a pretty good picture . Edward G . Robinson is at his snarling best as a nineteenth century version of Little Caesar on San Francisco's Barbary Coast during the gold rush days . Basically Miriam Hopkins has come to San Francisco to marry a newly minted millionaire whom she barely knows , but finds he's dead and fortune gone on her arrival . Since there was no real love involved , she doesn't have a problem teaming up with the man who probably had her fiancé robbed and killed , that being Edward G . Robinson . It's a pretty lawless place San Francisco . It's been newly acquired by the USA in the Mexican War and it being one of the great natural harbors of the world , a perfect arrival point for people traveling by sea to the gold fields . And such law that's operating is pretty much operating for the town bosses . There is a scene where after Brian Donlevy , who's Robinson's chief henchman , kills a man a trial is held right in Robinson's gambling palace . It's an impromptu affair with a crooked judge who naturally finds Donlevy not guilty . It's no wonder that certain citizens form a vigilante committee to restore some kind of justice to San Francisco . All part of the colorful history of that place . And that part of the film is well done . Where Barbary Coast fails is in the romance department . Miriam Hopkins though a woman of conscience has a practical side to her . The weakness of the film is in Joel McCrea's performance . He's a prospector who having made his fortune wants to return home . He has a chance encounter with Hopkins and she takes a shine to him and McCrea doesn't know she's Robinson's main squeeze . Now I'm a big fan of Joel McCrea , the most virtuous of heroes Hollywood ever produced . But in this one , he's not really virtuous as much as he's an idiot . Let's just say that I cannot understand why Hopkins wants anything to do with him . A much stronger character might have believably taken her from Robinson , but not McCrea in this film . Barbary Coast was responsible for the first real notices of two prominent character actors . Walter Brennan had been knocking around for years , but he received his first real attention as a player as waterfront character Old Atrocity . And with minimal dialog , Brian Donlevy made his first real impression on film audiences as Robinson's strong arm killer . It's entertaining , but I'd mute the sound when Barbary Coast turns away from the action .
393934	2483625	25903	5.0	A Northwestern for the Duke	Within the first 10 minutes of The Trail Beyond , John Wayne gets a chore from a friend to locate the friend's friend and his daughter in the Canadian woods , meets another friend Noah Beery , Jr . from college , gets innocently involved in a murder and is fleeing up to Canada with Beery . There's almost as much canoe paddling as horseback riding in The Trail Beyond for our intrepid heroes . They've got to keep on the move from the Mounties who are looking to extradite both of them to America and Wayne's still got his mission on his mind . And if that ain't enough they get involved in a feud between the Hudson Bay Company local trading post owner , Noah Beery Sr . and some French Meti trappers . They're the bad guys and as another reviewer remarked their accents are pretty bad . Like Pepe Le Pew . Other than Island in the Sky , I believe this might be the only John Wayne film with a Canadian location . Even though they got no farther to Canada than the Sierras in California . What this film does give , is an opportunity to see both Noah Beerys , senior and junior in the same film . I saw that they have about seven screen credits jointly and this I believe is the only one available on VHS and DVD . Furthermore for once the senior Beery is not playing a bad guy . So while this one won't even make the top Fifty of John Wayne's films for all those reasons it might be worth a look .
392809	2483625	25969	5.0	The Monogram Stock Company	West of the Divide finds the Duke as a man searching for his younger brother and at the same time the people who kidnapped him and murdered their father . The film opens with a piece of good luck coming their way in the person of the dying gunman Gatt Ganns who's been hired by Lloyd Whitlock to kill rancher Lafe McKee . Of course Whitlock is once again a villain in the Snidely Whiplash tradition who not only wants the ranch , but also has evil designs on McKee's daughter Virginia Brown Faire . In reviewing B westerns , sometimes I have a tendency to reach back to those 19th century morality plays so popular in that era . Whitlock in fact even laughs like a villain in one of those plays . For reference you should see the Irene Dunne-Allan Jones version of Showboat to see just the kind of drama they used to put on then . It survived in the B western , John Wayne's as well as other's . Wayne of course by the end solves all the problems concerned and the villain gets his just desserts . We can't say how though . The Duke pretends to be the recently deceased Mr . Ganns to get the goods on the bad guys along with sidekick Gabby Hayes . He discovers a young kid being raised by one of the outlaws . Interesting in this B western set firmly in the 19th century morality play tradition , we also have a topic so very gingerly touched on as child abuse . A rather adult theme for a western or any kind of picture at that time . Wayne was just beginning his stay at Monogram Pictures Lone Star westerns , this was his third . Monogram had a stock company to rival the much better one of John Ford . Note how for the next three or four years , the casts are just about the same in every Wayne western at that studio . It gets hard to keep these in chronological order , I wouldn't be surprised if a few of these weren't shot simultaneously . The best you can say about the Monogram films is that they kept John Wayne employed , not something easily said during the Depression . And they beat those serials he did for Mascot . West of the Divide will never be on any John Wayne fans top 10 list .
396728	2483625	79117	5.0	The Reluctant Nazi	Roger Moore is the Austrian commandant of a German POW camp located in the Grecian Isles in Escape to Athena . He's got a couple of favorites among the prisoners , an Italian cook in Sonny Bono , an archaeologist in David Niven and a black GI magician in Richard Roundtree . In addition USO entertainers Elliott Gould and Stefanie Powers are shot down in their transport plane and become Moore's prisoners . Moore really hasn't got his heart in the commandant business . He's an antique dealer in civilian life and he relishes the assignment only because of the location where he's also involved in Adolph Hitler's looting of Greek antiquities of which there are many in that area . Niven and company aid him because if they didn't they'd be in the hands of the SS . STill they want there freedom . Which they get when they join with resistance leader Telly Savalas and his mistress , bordello madam Claudia Cardinale . It's rumored there's a lot of hidden loot in a monastery on a nearby hill , whatever Moore hasn't taken for his own private stock for after the war . But Savalas is interested in some prototype V2 rockets located there . Escape to Athena mixes the plot elements of The Guns of Navarone and Topkapi , but they're not stirred too well . The scenery is quite nice and I'm sure the prospect of some paid time in the Aegean Sea might have been a big inducement for all these people signing on for the movie . As he was involved with Stefanie Powers at the time , William Holden gets a small unbilled cameo in a brief scene with Elliott Gould . As it turns out Moore's Prison Camp is also Stalag XVII . That might have been part of the package for Stefanie to go to Greece . It was also plain dumb to make Richard Roundtree a black GI . Americans were not involved in that theater , let alone black soldiers . Now if they had made his character be part of the African colonial troops of the British Empire , it would have made more sense . Then again we couldn't have heard Roundtree call a German soldier a ' cool cat ' . The action sequences are done well enough , but the cast here just collected their paychecks and walked through the parts .
393065	2483625	25284	5.0	Out of His League	I Sell Anything features Pat O'Brien as a fast talking auctioneer who operates from a store on Second Avenue who boasts he can sell anything to anybody . As Spot Cash Cutler , Pat has one busy afternoon when he takes in Ann Dvorak who tries to lift a watch from him because she hasn't eaten in a few days . Things like that happened during the Depression . But also he gets himself good and taken when he lets go for Fifty dollars a silver belt buckle that was owned and designed by Cellini . The glamorous Claire Dodd who bought it from him then turns around and sells it to the Metropolitan Museum of Art for $5000 . 00 . Of course Pat's hot under the collar having been taken like that . It's his pride more than anything else that's hurt . So he goes to her place on Fifth Avenue and demands a cut . Now he has about as much standing to squawk , legal or otherwise , as I do . But Dodd's intrigued with him . Pat should have listened to the advice of his faithful assistant Roscoe Karns and stayed well clear of Dodd . She's got quite a ride in store for him and for that you have to hope TCM runs this film again in the near future . We're all used to seeing Pat O'Brien as the fast talking streetwise con man , but we're not used to seeing him get taken . That's the gimmick here in I'll Sell Anything . Might make one curious to watch . O'Brien is in a comfortable part for him as is Roscoe Karns . Ann Dvorak and Claire Dodd are in their usual good girl / bad girl roles . Actually a good thing Dvorak is around as a choice , although she really doesn't contribute anything to the story except offer O'Brien an alternative woman . Still it's an amusing 71 minutes .
393783	2483625	36229	5.0	The Oklahoma Kid Lite	If anyone who saw this film back in 1943 as a short subject with a Warner Brothers feature and thought this looked familiar , they were absolutely right . Even the costumes were the same for Robert Shayne and Warner Anderson playing the roles that James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart played . Of course with those guys being somewhat taller than Cagney and Bogey the fit had to be considerably let out for this mini-version of The Oklahoma Kid . Apparently Warner Brothers was doing something like that with a few of their classics . I saw another mini-version of Dodge City done by them at the same time which also used footage from the original . That one was so badly edited you could plainly recognize Errol Flynn and Olivia DeHavilland in crowd scenes . Never say the old moguls didn't know how to salvage and reuse .
392758	2483625	60164	5.0	Dino , say Mini-Series	Dino DeLaurentis was a man who thought big and somewhere in the early sixties he got the idea to do the biblical spectacle film of all time . Not just settle for one story mind you , but the whole Bible . Of course what he proposed would have been something along the lines of Erich Von Stroheim's silent film Greed which in the director's cut ran something like nine hours . DeLaurentis was persuaded that maybe just half the book of Genesis might contain enough subject matter for a theatrical film . But even at that it was too much . But curiously enough according to the Films of John Huston , The Bible was the best grossing John Huston film ever . Mainly because the one section of the film that got good critical response was the section dealing with Noah and the Flood . And playing Noah and directing himself was John Huston . I'd have to agree with the critics , Huston was a good Noah indeed , in fact in the last of the Planet of the Apes series he kind of reprises his part as the patriarch Noah with simian makeup . I remember back in the day , The Bible got a whole lot of family trade as parents brought the little kids in to see all the animals on the ark . The rest of the film unfortunately is too long . The people talk just like they did in a DeMille film , but without DeMille's flair for the spectacle . In fact Dino should have waited for another decade when the mini-series format was accepted on television and tried his original idea on the small screen . For myself , I don't think there's ever been a film about Joshua and his leadership of the Israelites in conquering the land of Canaan . Jericho's walls a-tumbling down , make a great movie scene , especially now with computer graphics . Maybe one day they'll release the Noah portion as a single film and it might still get good reviews today .
392913	2483625	44919	5.0	Montana Bull	Montana Belle which probably at best started out to be an average B western product from RKO got to Howard Hughes's attention because it starred his protégé Jane Russell . This make believe account of the famous female outlaw Belle Starr got cut and recut and edited down to a mess of a story if you're looking for coherency . The film was made in 1948 and released in 1952 and that's always bad news . Like Jane's first feature , The Outlaw , certain western legends who never in real life met up with each other , have dealings in the Hollywood west . In The Outlaw , it's the Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid story rewritten to have Doc Holiday's participation . In Montana Belle , Jane as Belle Starr is rescued by Bob Dalton played by Scott Brady . But later when she mistakes a doublecross she forms her own gang with Forrest Tucker and Jack Lambert as a most stereotypical Indian . In the meantime another guy with his hormones in a tizzy over Jane's titanic weaponry is George Brent , gentleman gambler and owner of the largest liquor & gaming establishment in Guthrie , Oklahoma . He's going to reform Jane and separate her from her disreputable outlaw companions . Nice work if you can get it . You can't say too much about the story , Howard Hughes muddled this one , the same as he muddled , The Outlaw , Jet Pilot , and My Forbidden Past . One thing he didn't do for which we can thank the Deity is that he didn't cut Jane's number , The Gilded Lily from the film . It's definitely the best thing about Montana Belle . But over at Republic they were shooting westerns with all their B stars that had more coherent plots than you see here .
394371	2483625	236493	5.0	The Last Assignment Is The Last Straw	Luckless Brad Pitt can't seem to work off a debt that he owes crime boss Gene Hackman in an unbilled role . Four years earlier he got into a fender bender with Hackman right at the moment that Hackman was carrying someone in the trunk of his car . Only because it was a live someone , Hackman got off with a few years in the joint , but he makes sure Pitt pays and pays for that fender bender . His last assignment seems simple enough go to Mexico and find a bring back an antique pistol , a real piece of craftsmanship that several legends have been told about . But even that last assignment is the last straw for his girlfriend Julia Roberts . She gives him the old heave ho as he leaves for Mexico . But just to make sure Pitt follows through , Roberts is kidnapped and held hostage by James Gandolfini , a gay hit man with whom she bonds rather strangely with . Of course you don't expect things to go smoothly for Pitt . The Mexican is one of those murphy's law films , if anything can go wrong it does go wrong . The Mexican is a film that was made more than likely for no other reason than let's team Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts and get some real box office out of it . They seem to work well together , but this very quirky film just doesn't quite jell . Possibly it should have been played more as an out and out comedy than it was . James Gandolfini comes out best in this film . Still fans of Pitt , Roberts , and the Sopranos might like it . Although if you go in expecting to see Tony Sooprano , fuggedaboutit .
396302	2483625	79813	5.0	Spreading The Ramone Gospel	If you're not a fan of the post disco music scene that The Ramones represented you're probably not going to like Rock " N " Roll High School . And if you do nothing that I or any other reviewer says will influence you in the slightest degree . There's no plot in this anarchistic film by Roger Corman , but that's part of the fun . It involves new school principal Miss Togar from the Ilsa Koch's Buchenwald school of education trying to restore some discipline to Vince Lombardi High School . Her main opponent is P . J . Soles who has dedicated her life to spreading the gospel of The Ramones to her peers . But in Mary Woronov as principal Togar , she's got a ruthless adversary . There's a subplot going involving young Vincent Van Patten looking for some sex from somewhere . Here it gets a bit ridiculous because I can't believe Vincent Van Patten couldn't get any female or gay male if that was what he might want . He plays the same kind of goofy teenager that David Cassidy did on The Partridge Family . Of course all this is an excuse to play a whole lot of Ramone songs including the title song of this film . Stylistically Rock ' N ' Roll High School borrows from A Hard Day's Night and from Grease and the mix is good . It ain't exactly my kind of music and it's not O'Neill or Shakespeare , but the film is amusing and harmless . And the ending is the dream of a lot of teenagers .
395984	2483625	59418	5.0	Made Up as he went along	In his autobiography , Charlton Heston spent more time talking about this film than any other . Some other commentator said that it looked like someone took over the direction . The commentator was very observant . Heston had to take over the direction because Sam Peckinpah just lost interest and began indulging in all kinds of vices down on location in Mexico which I won't get into . Read Heston's book . Suffice it to say that he was unable to go to the set , for any number of reasons . Heston says that Peckinpah was making it up as he went along and the film sure looks it . The plot just meanders into various situations that this motley crew of Indian fighters encounter . Heston also said that he violated a rule of his own to never start a film without a complete script , something he never did again . The film is an incredible waste of fine talented cast . Charlton Heston and I both think the film had real possibilities and that Sam Peckinpah was a flawed talent . If you want to see the film , read Charlton Heston's account of its making .
393522	2483625	36419	5.0	Not Your Current View of Andy Johnson	Though Tennessee Johnson boasts fine performances by Van Heflin , Ruth Hussey , and Lionel Barrymore as Andrew Johnson , Eliza McCardle Johnson , and Thaddeus Stevens respectively , the wrong story about Johnson was told here . The accepted historical view of Andrew Johnson's presidency now is that had he been a bit more of a politician and also had been able to rise above the prejudices of his poor white class , the whole impeachment would never have happened . His actions through the use of the presidential veto in stalling the Reconstruction set racial equality in the USA aside for a century . Men of good will on both sides had they been willing to give a little might have settled on a compromise Reconstruction policy without all the rancor that characterized it and U . S . politics for decades . The real story is Andy Johnson's rise to the presidency . As is showed here young Johnson arrives in Tennessee escaping a kind of slavery of his own . He was an indentured servant to a tailor and learned the trade , but after differences with his employer in his native North Carolina , Johnson escapes to Tennessee . Andrew Johnson is the only United States president who never spent one day inside a school classroom . He was taught to read and write by the woman who later became Mrs . Johnson . There's was a real love story , one of the most romantic in our history . Johnson's real moment of courage was after a slow rise up the political ladder that saw him elected as Mayor of Greenville , Tennessee , the state legislature , the House of Representatives , governor and then senator from Tennessee . In 1861 he was the only southern Senator to not walk out of the Senate when the south seceded . He became military governor of Tennessee when the Union Army captured enough of it to set up a government . Johnson's very life was in peril every minute from the firing on Fort Sumter to Lee's surrender at Appomattox . That's a story worth telling . Unfortunately Johnson represented the poor white class in Tennessee and saw freed slaves as a rival labor force . He had all the prejudices of his class and wasn't hesitant to voice them . That part of the story is not told in Tennessee Johnson . I did like Charles Dingle's performance as Senator Waters , why he wasn't given his real name in history of that of Ben Wade of Ohio is beyond me . As President Pro Tempore of the Senate with no sitting Vice President , he was first in line of succession had Johnson been impeached . From what I know of Ben Wade , Dingle fitted the role well . Though it made good cinema , Andrew Johnson never addressed the Senate personally during his impeachment trial . There was an ill Senator who cast a deciding vote that saved Johnson's presidency . But unlike William Farnum's character of Senator Valley , James Grimes of Iowa had been felled by a stroke and no one expected him to be in the Senate that day . But he was carried in and voted not guilty . The real story of Andrew Johnson is one of the most dramatic about one who turned out to be one of our worst presidents . Too bad it wasn't told in Tennessee Johnson .
395819	2483625	70825	5.0	" Let's Go to Mexico "	Ann-Margret has hired John Wayne and company to find some stolen gold that her husband along with other outlaws had robbed . It's in Mexico , a four day ride according to her . So off our intrepid group goes to Mexico . Of course those other outlaws are after it also so therein lies the tale . Burt Kennedy did so much better for the Duke in The War Wagon than in this one . Pity because the chemistry between the cast is pretty good . If this were back in the days of B westerns , I can easily see Wayne with Ben Johnson and Rod Taylor in a kind of Three Mesquiteer series with a bigger budget . There are so few action sequences . The chemistry is good , but that's only part of it . In my review of The Comancheros I mentioned that Wayne and Stuart Whitman's chemistry was excellent and it carried the film . But there was a LOT more action in The Comancheros than in The Train Robbers . It's only 90 minutes and that is short for a feature film by 1973 . There is a real explosive climax with the nameless , faceless , villains that have been pursuing the group at the end . And Ricardo Montalban's Pinkerton man at the end really gives an unexpected twist to the proceedings . That was pure Burt Kennedy . I think most fans of John Wayne will be disappointed in this one .
395799	2483625	70438	6.0	Disaster Film On A Budget	The Neptune Factor deals with some scientists who live and work out of an undersea lab in the Atlantic Ocean . One fine day while their bosses , Walter Pidgeon , Yvette Mimieux , and Ernest Borgnine are up top , an earthquake occurs and the lab topples over into an underwater crevice . Though an atomic power submarine could stay down there indefinitely the problem is that crevice is way too small for one of those big boys . A smaller type submarine able to withstand the pressures of the very deep is needed and that's where Ben Gazzara and his ship the Neptune come in . As disaster films go The Neptune Factor is small potatoes special effects wise . It's a Canadian production and I've seen Hollywood come up with worse films spending a ton more money than was done here . The special effects such as they are , are merely movie films of some ordinary species of marine life blown up several times their size , because these are the creatures the crew finds down at depths that man hasn't been before . It's beautiful undersea photography just like a trip to Marineland . It's a no frills production , no subplots of any kind , no social interaction of any kind with the crew , just do the mission and go home . That's why it was given a G rating when first released . If you love Jacques Cousteau , you'll love this film .
393502	2483625	43955	6.0	Updating of a Prohibition era play	The Racket was originally a play on Broadway which ran for 119 performances in the 1927-1928 season and was later made into a silent film by Howard Hughes . Come 1951 and the Kefauver Senate Rackets Committee hearings in full swing , the gangster film was having a renaissance . So Hughes dusted off this old chestnut and updated it to post World War II America and gave it to his most reliable star at RKO . Robert Mitchum , though cast against type , does well as the upright police captain . I believe his character is based on a man named Lewis J . Valentine who was a well known police captain in New York in the Hylan-Walker era . Valentine was assigned to something called The Confidential Squad which delved into organized crime . Valentine like Captain McQuigg in The Racket , stepped on a lot of toes and got transferred to garbage assignments . Ultimately he was vindicated when Fiorello LaGuardia became mayor , he made Valentine first the Chief of Uniform Patrol and later Police Commissioner . He probably was the best that ever held that job in New York City . Robert Ryan is at his snarling best as old time gangster Nick Scanlon . Ryan is a man behind the times , the syndicate is looking for less public methods to enforce it's will and Ryan is constantly bumping up against them . Interestingly enough , problems are not solved here . McQuigg keeps his precinct clean , but the corruption is shown to be quite systemic . A very groundbreaking attitude for that era . Though The Racket met with a great deal of criticism by reviewers as being old fashioned , I rather like it and would classify it as one of the better products coming out of RKO during the Hughes era .
393362	2483625	52627	6.0	Would You Believe They Wanted John Wayne ? ? ? ?	Howard Keel says in his posthumously published memoirs that he grabbed the part of Simon Peter in The Big Fisherman to prove his versatility as an actor . Musicals were pretty much done by that time and he was free of his MGM contract . He got the role after John Wayne turned the part down . That one was an eye opener I have to say . My conception of St . Peter has always been that of a big hale and hearty man used to working in the outdoors . We see an older Peter in Quo Vadis with Finlay Currie and now we have a younger one in Keel . Still I can't believe that Frank Borzage wanted John Wayne . After coming off that disaster in The Barbarian and the Geisha , the Duke wisely turned this one down . Keel does give a good performance as Peter . Other than Keel the player best remembered for this film is Ray Stricklyn as the evil young Arab prince . It's good to remember that this is a fictional story about a biblical figure though some scenes of events described in the Bible are in the film . Nevertheless there are some plot flaws . Peter goes among the Arabs here and this was six centuries before Mohammed came on the scene . If you were to follow the logic of the film , the Arab people would have been converted to Christianity . Now maybe it would have saved us all a lot of bloodshed over the centuries had they , still even in a work of fiction that's a bit much to swallow . Keel liked making the film and had high hopes for it . Unfortunately it ran up against Ben-Hur another filmed biblically based novel this time with the protagonist being a fictional character . Additionally The Big Fisherman got lost somewhere in the corporate doings of Buena Vista Films and the Walt Disney studio . Back in the Fifties , Buena Vista did distribute films not necessarily with the Walt Disney brand on them . It's been seen on television a few times , I saw it again about 12 years ago . It should be seen in theaters though . Like Ben-Hur something is lost even with a letter box version . But can you imagine John Wayne as St . Peter ? Turn that one over in your minds .
393820	2483625	61024	6.0	Ain't a Patch on the John Ford version	After seeing this version on AMC a few days ago , I took out my copy of the original from 1939 . It's the difference between a classic western and a routine action film . Director Gordon Douglas probably because there is an unwritten rule in Hollywood that no one is ever to shoot a film in Monument Valley but John Ford , shot this thing in Colorado . It's not badly photographed , but you really miss the sweeping vistas of the Arizona desert . The Apache become the Sioux here and instead we have Geronimo jumping the reservation it's Crazy Horse instead . One of the great moments of cinema westerns in the original Stagecoach is when the cavalry sweeps by the passing Stagecoach to engage the Apaches in the rescue . John Ford liked it so much he used the same gambit in Fort Apache . In this version you have to believe that the passengers fought them off themselves and then made it into Cheyenne on three wheels with less horses . No way , Jose . Poor Alex Cord , a competent actor , is no John Wayne . Of course who is and Cord tries his best , but you can't forget the Duke . Michael Connors as Hatfield lacks fire in his portrayal . John Carradine created a real air of mystery about the gambler . Nothing like that here . This is one of Bing Crosby's few non-singing roles and he got some deservedly good reviews for reprising Thomas Mitchell's Doc Boone . In fact some of his scenes with Red Buttons as Peacock the whiskey drummer are faintly reminiscent of Crosby's work with Bob Hope . Buttons is not Donald Meek and he plays the part differently . Meek was a man with a Dickensian name and he played mostly parts that fit that name perfectly . After the Indian attack , Buttons is a man with a few drinks under his belt ready to lick the world . It's different , but nicely done . Another musical performer in this was Ann-Margret . For the life of me I can't figure out why with two people like Crosby and Ann-Margret , they didn't give her and him a song or two , a duet maybe . Especially since in the plot line here , Crosby takes a fatherly interest in Ann-Margret as well as in Alex Cord . Her role of Dallas is as a saloon girl so a musical number would not have been out of place . The rest of the cast performs adequately . Bob Cummings's Gatewood is more fully developed a character here and a bigger rat . Van Heflin and Slim Pickens are able substitutes for George Bancroft and Andy Devine . Stefanie Powers as the pregnant cavalry officer's wife is adequate . The part itself is as thin as the original version with Louise Platt doing it . The gunfight between the Plummers and Ringo is more fully developed here . You actually don't see it in the 1939 version . Keenan Wynn as Luke Plummer is also more fully developed than was Tom Tyler . Tyler with a minimum of dialog suggested the menace of Luke Plummer . But Keenan Wynn is one evil man here . In fact whole pages of dialog are taken from the original . Interesting that 20 years later another version was done . But this Stagecoach is a perfect example of why classics should just be left alone .
393996	2483625	217521	6.0	Idolized Outlaw Father	The Great Stagecoach Robbery was one of the Red Ryder series from Republic Pictures . Though Herbert J . Yates's main star at this time was singing cowboy Roy Rogers not all of his stars sung . Bill Elliott was one of several actors to play the role comic book cowboy hero Red Ryder on the screen . He might be the best known of the screen Red Ryders although his nickname of Wild Bill Elliott came from playing Wild Bill Hickok in a few films . This film was something of a shock to me as it involved the murder of a child and a deliberate one on one act of homicide . The Ryder tries to aid an outlaw played by Francis McDonald to go straight which is his intention . But other people have different ideas for McDonald . First his two kids John James and Sylvia Arslan who idolize their outlaw father . Two of McDonald's former henchmen want to take up business as usual . But the fact that McDonald is coming back to Painted Valley to return $150 . 000 . 00 in stolen money which he hid before being arrested doesn't sit well with them at all . These two try to use the kids for their nefarious purposes . The murder of Sylvia Arslan in a film that was designed for the Saturday matinée crowd was something I never figured to see in a Republic cowboy movie . It's all the more gruesome because the perpetrator is an authority figure . How Herbert J . Yates let this one out let alone the censors miss it is a mystery . Considering what has transpired the Heigh-Ho Silver ending with Red Ryder and Little Beaver riding off into the sunset is a bit much . Still The Great Stagecoach Robbery is not a bad B western and you can see why the strong and personable Wild Bill Elliott was such a popular cowboy star back in the day .
394578	2483625	26043	6.0	Cashing In On It Happened One Night	A year earlier Clark Gable as a " punishment " for a recalcitrant star was farmed out to Columbia Pictures by Louis B . Mayer to make a real dog of a film about a bus trip entitled It Happened One Night . That film essentially created the modern screen comedy as we know it and made a grand slam of the major Oscar categories including one for Clark Gable as Best Actor . Gable played a newspaper reporter in that one , on the trail of runaway heiress Claudette Colbert . One thing about Louis B . Mayer , if he saw a trend he'd capitalize on it . If his number one star got an Oscar as a reporter , we'll make him an editor . And we'll bring the society girl into the newsroom where she's also working as a reporter . Common job interests should provide a basis for romance . And that boys and girls is how After Office Hours came into being . But despite the naughty title , the main thing that Clark Gable and Constance Bennett are working on after work is an argument over a society murder . Gable has a notion that the man arrested for murdering a society grand dame who was doing a little stepping out is not the guilty party . He needs Bennett to help him gain entree to the Cholly Knickerbocker set to prove it . Bennett and Gable settle comfortably into their roles and Stu Erwin has a nice turn as Gable's sidekick . As for Louis B . Mayer and MGM , After Office Hours did OK , but Gable made them some big money that year in Mutiny on the Bounty . But I'll bet Mayer was mighty careful over what he assigned as punishments .
393690	2483625	43175	6.0	The TV Show Takes The Rap For Radio	I don't think I've seen any Amos ' n Andy Shows for over 40 years now , but I still remember them from television and the history behind them . Early television was stuck for creative programming and what better programming than to bring successful radio programs over to television . There certainly was no more successful radio program than Amos ' n Andy . A couple of average vaudevillians who did a blackface act called Sam ' n Henry named Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll sold a radio program based on their act . They just changed the names and it became Amos ' n Andy , the better for alliteration . This was in the middle of the Roaring Twenties and it was the most successful of radio programs during radio's golden age . If you were to look at television Amos ' n Andy and contrast it with something like Sanford and Son , you'd find a remarkable lot of similarities . On television Amos got into the episodes , but mostly functioned as narrator as the character Kingfish really starred in the series . Every week this Fred Sanford like character had all kinds of plans and it usually involved getting his Lamont like pal Andy swindled in some manner . This Sanford was not a widower , he lived with his Elizabeth who is not the saintly figure Fred makes her out to be . Sapphire was at her wit's end with her lazy husband . George Stevens was Kingfish's straight name and he also lived with an Aunt Esther in the person of Sapphire's Momma , not a woman to cross as I remember . The men hung out at the Mystic Knight's of the Sea Lodge probably to stay away from the wives . Except Andy who was a confirmed bachelor . They also included a shyster lawyer Algonquin J . Calhoun who I remember actually got to court in one episode and we learned he was disbarred . I daresay you could have taken the plot of any given Amos ' n Andy television episode and have rewritten it for Sanford and Son . They may have done just that in fact . Still though Amos ' n Andy with its origins in vaudeville blackface has born a stigma that it can't erase . I really feel if Amos ' n Andy had been an original television creation it would not have the stigma it has today . The Kingfish with his never ending get rich quick schemes that involved duping the hapless Andy every week and his henpecked home life that W . C . Fields never saw the equal of was a pretty funny show . I knew it was even in my single digit years . The chemistry between Tim Moore as Kingfish and Spencer Williams as Andy was evident even for a little kid . The Kingfish was a funny guy , but he was a loser and I sympathized with Ernestine Wade as Sapphire for being stuck with this lunkhead . And no one should have had the mother-in-law from hell Amanda Randolph . One of these days I'll see some of those episodes with Sanford & Son side by side and test my theory .
393671	2483625	25939	6.0	Combining The Genres	Randolph Scott at this point in his career when he wasn't doing other films was learning the western genre in a series of films that Paramount's B unit was doing from Zane Grey novels . In this particular one , Rocky Mountain Mystery , Grey tried his hand at a detective story and skilfully combined the genres . Randy's a mining engineer , but he's turning amateur sleuth to find out what's happened to his brother-in-law , who no one has heard from . Upon arriving at the scene he meets deputy sheriff Chic Sale who's investigating the murder of the owner of a mine . The two of them decide to join forces . The film is set in the contemporary west , at least the contemporary west of when Zane Grey wrote the story . There's reference to Chic Sale's son killed in the Great War and how Scott reminds him of his late son . When these two arrive at the mine , there's a lot of interesting people living there . As it turns out there's quite an intricate scheme working there of which the homicide is only one aspect . I wish this film had been given a bigger budget and the A treatment because the film had potential . Young Ann Sheridan is the female lead , this is probably one of her first films in that regard , she'd be signed by Warner Brothers next year . However the important reason to see the film is the appearance of one of the great stage stars of the last centuries and notorious personalities . Mrs . Leslie Carter ( and that's how she was billed ) has the role of family matriarch of the clan at the mine and even in her old age you can tell what a beauty she was back then . Her acting is also decent , no exaggerated stage mannerisms from back in her day when she learned her craft from David Belasco . Her divorce from her husband was one of the great scandals of the day . Divorce back in her time was scandalous in and of itself . She was left penniless by the divorce , but Belasco seeking to capitalize on her notoriety , took her under his wing and trained her in the thespian arts . People exploiting their celebrity , some things never change . You can see her story in the film , The Lady With Red Hair starring Miriam Hopkins and Claude Rains . By the way she was billed under her former married name to take advantage of the fact that was how the public knew her and to stick it to her ex . Even without Mrs . Leslie Carter , Rocky Mountain Mystery is a decent film , I wish had been given better production values by Paramount .
395369	2483625	122255	6.0	A Cutthroat Profession	Like America when Australia decided to make its first talking motion picture it decided it should sing as well . With the exception of one player in the cast , the film was mostly made up of folks who must have primarily been stage performers . The theater in the outback must have been one cutthroat profession . Susan Denis and Sadie Bedford are in a traveling theatrical troupe that seems to be barely getting by . Anyway when an offer comes for Denis to star in a new talking motion picture to be made in Sydney , Bedford steals it and pretends to be Denis . The troupe travels in a cattle car with a koala bear for company and Denis , desperate for work , signs on as a Swedish maid at a hotel . Why they specified Swedes in the job application , God only knows , but she fakes it . And wouldn't you know , the film company doing some location shooting also arrives and things start to pop . All the cast members who this Yank hasn't heard of have real limited screen credits . But Arthur Tauchert had several silent films for his resume and he was one of Australia's leading actors at the time . My knowledge of Aussie cinema begins with Chips Rafferty , but Tauchert in fact made his farewell appearance in this film . Sorry I don't know more about him or the films of Australia . I will say this though , having seen the recent big budget production of Australia , I am impressed with it now more than ever seeing how well it captured the outback after having seen this .
395423	2483625	25532	6.0	Murder On A Budget	Murder on the Blackboard is the second of three Hildegarde Withers stories that Edna May Oliver and James Gleason were teamed for . Today the charm of these two people , two of the best character actors that movies ever saw carry this rather dated and melodramatic story . One of the teachers at Edna's school , Barbara Fritchie , winds up very dead and she's quite the lively corpse as the perpetrator keeps moving the body in an effort to be rid of it . In fact the only way the crime is discovered is because that day Edna kept young Jackie Searle after school . Unlike the Thin Man movies where you could have as many as ten suspects or more in a room as Nick and Nora reveal all , this is not MGM with their lavish productions . This is RKO and this studio had a limited budget for their films . We only have four suspects so your chances of guessing who did it increase quite a bit . Edgar Kennedy as the dumb cop who gets clunked on the head and develops amnesia is his usual funny self . In fact he's the foil used to catch the murderer in the end . As for the end , I found it a bit melodramatic for my taste and let it go at that . But for fans of the wonderful Edna May Oliver and the dependable James Gleason this film is a must .
394948	2483625	36677	6.0	As Buffalo Bill saw himself .	If William F . Cody had lived until 1944 he would have loved this film . Most of all he would have approved of the casting of Hollywood's most straight arrow hero Joel McCrea as himself . That's the image Cody liked to convey even if it wasn't exactly the truth . The real Cody was a brave enough hero all right and this film does mention some of the highlights of his real life , the buffalo hunt with Grand Duke Alexei of Russia , the hand to hand fight with Yellow Hand at War Bonnet Gorge , and the formation of his wild west show . The trouble was the real Cody got into show business and he was ballyhooed out of all proportion to his real accomplishments . And Cody was lent himself admirably to exploitation . The movie is the kind of ballyhoo that Cody would have approved . Cody's chief publicist in real life was Ned Buntline who is faithfully portrayed here by Thomas Mitchell . Maureen O'Hara is Louisa Frederici Cody and she's the faithful , but eastern bred wife . No hint of the real marriage problems that plagued the Codys . Linda Darnell and Edgar Buchanan are in this film and I don't really know why . Darnell is an Indian school mistress and Buchanan is a grizzled old army trooper . No real reason for either of them in the film . Darnell is killed at War Bonnet Gorge and she must have been the first squaw who rode into battle . Buchanan's character is also left hanging in the air . Anthony Quinn is Cheyenne chief Yellow Hand and is Cody's worthy adversary on the screen . Buffalo Bill Cody's real contribution was the wild west show . Cody had many imitators , but he was the original . Until Hollywood took over with the making of the first silent westerns , these shows created the myths surrounding the winning of the west . Sadly that part of Cody's life is given short shrift . But Buffalo Bill would have loved this film . Whether today's audience would is open to speculation .
393112	2483625	36699	6.0	Teresa Says , " Just Gary and Me , and Baby Makes Three . "	Gary Cooper in the first half of the Forties made four films for director Sam Wood . Three of them were big budget items , Pride of the Yankees , For Whom The Bells Toll , and Saratoga Trunk . The fourth is a pleasant and innocuous little comedy called Casanova Brown . The film was adapted by Floyd Dell who wrote the novel and play it was based on called Accidental Father . It had previously been filmed twice by Warner Brothers and once by the French cinema . It ran on Broadway in the 1929 season and probably got closed with the stock market crash . All the names were changed in this adaption , but the plot line remained essentially the same . Gary Cooper is about to get married to Anita Louise when he gets a cryptic note from Teresa Wright . He confides in Anita's father , Frank Morgan who is a fellow colleague at the college where Cooper is an English professor . Morgan also seems to function more as a western sidekick for Cooper than a father of the bride for Louise . Cooper's little secret is that he was ever so briefly married to Teresa Wright . Her cryptic note says he should go to a maternity hospital in Chicago and see a certain doctor there . Cooper of course arrives at some logical conclusions . Teresa of course has an agenda of her own and I can't say too much more as both women fight for Cooper . Of course with that baby , Ms . Wright definitely has the upper hand . Casanova Brown was the second of two films Cooper and Wright did together , the first being the highly acclaimed Pride of the Yankees . This film isn't anything like the epic story of Lou Gehrig , but it is definitely a pleasant enough diversion . It's an opportunity to see Frank Morgan in a rare appearance outside the MGM studio . He has some very good moments in Casanova Brown as Cooper's confidante . However Casanova Brown has one claim to immortality . There is a flashback sequence where Cooper is telling Morgan about the relationship with Wright . After they've eloped Wright brings Cooper to meet her parents who are played by Edmond Breon and Patricia Collinge . Collinge is a believer in astrology and no smoking . Cooper in an effort to hide the fact he smoked a cigarette in their house , manages to burn their house down . It is one of the most hilarious things ever put on film . The rest of the film is good and entertaining , but it doesn't match up to that scene . See Casanova Brown for that alone .
395972	2483625	24916	6.0	Horse With A Heart	In his memoirs Frank Capra gave very short shrift to Broadway Bill . In fact he only mentions it when he starts to talk about the remake of this film Riding High . The remake was in 1950 and Broadway Bill was done immediately after It Happened One Night . In just a couple of paragraphs he mentions that he did a film called Broadway Bill sandwiched between It Happened One Night and Mr . Deeds Goes To Town . He was dissatisfied with it because the leading man , Warner Baxter , was afraid of horses and it showed . Capra then said he resolved to do the film over again with an actor who loved horses . Of course he got Bing Crosby and second to golf Crosby did love horses and horse racing . It was a perfect fit . I didn't notice anything to terribly wrong with Baxter's performance away from the horse playing the title role . Baxter's a footloose sort of guy who's married to the daughter of millionaire Walter Connolly , Helen Vinson . Baxter's heart is at the racetrack , he loves the life and the people there . Vinson's younger sister Myrna Loy understands him though and it does take Baxter a while to figure out he married the wrong sister . Frank Capra filled out his cast with many of the regulars who appeared in his more well known classics and they all look like they were born and bred at the racetrack . In this and in Riding High , my favorite is Raymond Walburn , the larcenous and lovable old ' Colonel ' Pettigrew ready to make the ultimate sacrifice and marry ' Vinegar Puss ' Margaret Hamilton . Broadway Bill is not up there with Capra's more populistic films nor is it as good as Riding High , but it still is a wonderful heartwarming story of a horse who showed us in the higher species , the meaning of courage and heart .
394319	2483625	44144	6.0	Life's Real Treasure	No longer the debonair and very urban leading man , William Powell was trying to move into roles more in line with his age . Powell turned 60 at the time The Treasure of Lost Canyon and was now playing an eccentric married man who's cousin , Henry Hull has been robbing him blind for years . Into his life comes young Tommy Ivo whose mother died and his father killed in a stage holdup . Though he didn't think so , Powell takes to the young boy and his dog and plans to adopt him . Ivo locates some old bandit loot on Powell's property which seems to be the answer to their financial worries . That's the treasure in the title . But there are still a lot of questions to be answered . The Treasure of Lost Canyon is based on a Robert Louis Stevenson short story , The Treasure of Franchard and is clearly aimed at a family audience . It's a pleasant and rather short film , 82 minutes and is moderately entertaining . Stevenson fans will note the similarity between young Tommy Ivo and a couple of other young Stevenson heroes , David Balfour and Jim Hawkins . Besides those mentioned Rosemary DeCamp is Powell's wife and Charles Drake and Julia Adams play a pair of helpful neighbors . Especially Drake who is most helpful in getting a lot of questions answered . The Treasure of Lost Canyon is not a great film , but entertaining enough . Sad to say movie audiences apparently didn't take to William Powell in a role more suited to Gabby Hayes or Walter Brennan . Still though , Powell as romantic lead was far more ridiculous at his age .
395691	2483625	28269	6.0	That's What She Played , A Small Town Girl	For most of her career Janet Gaynor did nothing , but play small town girls , the best known being Esther Blodgett . But I've seen her in films like State Fair and Three Loves Has Nancy and it's the same part , the girl from the tiny hamlet who conquers the big city and the men in it . With a title like this , there was only one casting possibility . Janet's a girl who's thoroughly stuck in a rut in her New England hamlet and yearns for a little adventure . She finds it in the person of Robert Taylor , a young doctor who comes from a wealthy Boston family . After a night's carousing Gaynor and Taylor are married , to the chagrin of his fiancé , Binnie Barnes and her boyfriend James Stewart . Remember this is Boston so Taylor's father Lewis Stone prevails on Taylor to give the marriage a few months trial . Of course this is where the balance of the story comes in . In many ways this plot seems like a harbinger of The Way We Were . Taylor's career was now in full swing as Small Town Girl was the next film after his breakout performance in Magnificent Obsession . Remember in that film he was a playboy who became a doctor . Here's he's a doctor who doubles as a playboy . Never mind though , feminine hearts all over the English speaking world were fluttering over MGM's latest heartthrob . My mother who was a juvenile at this time told me that Taylor's appeal back in these days was just about the same as Elvis's . James Stewart was at the beginning of his career as well as MGM had him in about seven features in 1936 , mostly in support . Interesting though with worse career management , he could have gone on playing hick roles like Elmer the boyfriend . But it was also obvious there was a spark of stardom with him as well . Gaynor would leave the screen a few years later , Taylor was at the beginning of his career . He'd have better acting roles in his future , but for now Small Town Girl is a great example of the screen heartthrob he was at the beginning of his stardom . Fans of both stars will like what they see in Small Town Girl .
396587	2483625	41902	6.0	One Hopeless Marker	Sorrowful Jones is both the first time Bob Hope teamed up with Lucille Ball as a leading lady and it's his first try at a Damon Runyon character . It succeeded , but it's not as good as some of the other of Bob Hope's Forties comedies . This is a remake of Little Miss Marker where Adolphe Menjou played the role of Sorrowful Jones . The problem with this version is that in the first one the main character is the little girl left as a human marker for bookie Sorrowful Jones . The little girl back then was Shirley Temple and it was a Shirley Temple picture . No child was going to steal the spotlight from Bob Hope and this one has the emphasis on Hope's character which is all wrong . Little Mary Jane Saunders is not Shirley Temple , but who is . Anyway she does not steal the film from Hope and that's wrong . On the plus side Hope and Lucille Ball show some really good chemistry and they did far better in their next film together Fancy Pants . Also look for good performances from Bruce Cabot as the gambling kingpin and from William Demarest as Hope's sidekick . But if you want to see Hope and Ball at their best I recommend Fancy Pants .
393931	2483625	43959	7.0	Hostages Of A Volatile Bunch Of Outlaws	In the film Rawhide things start out like any other day for Tyrone Power who plays the son of the stage line owner spending some time at one of the way stations learning the business from grizzled old timer Edgar Buchanan . A stage stops by and Susan Hayward and toddler are among the passengers . But when a passing cavalry patrol brings news of a crashout by four very desperate criminals , one of whom was scheduled to be hung the next day , the driver decides he's not taking Sue and the little girl if there's going to be trouble . Even with a cavalry escort which you would think would have been enough to discourage any outlaws from robbing the stage . Sue stays at the station until word of capture or a stage going in another direction arrives . The four outlaws do arrive and they are four really lousy specimens of humanity . Led by Hugh Marlowe the candidate for the rope , the others include Jack Elam , George Tobias , and Dean Jagger . They kill Buchanan and stay at the station hoping to holdup a stage carrying a gold shipment . Marlowe is light years away from the nice guy playwright in All About Eve . You can hardly believe this is the same actor . But the guy making his first real mark in the cinema is Jack Elam . One of the most psychotic villains ever put on screen , Elam makes full use of his blind eye for some incredible facial expressions . His unconcealed lust for Hayward is driving Marlowe to his wits end who needs Power alive at least until the robbery is done . Tyrone Power was 37 when he made Rawhide , a bit too old for the part he was playing , still he does a good job . This is a remake of an earlier 20th Century Fox film Show Them No Mercy which had a modern setting and the Power and Hayward roles were played by Rochelle Hudson and Edward Norris who were barely in their twenties . But it's the outlaws here who really make this film . As Marlowe is quick to comment this isn't a crew he'd pick , they just happened to be around when he made his break and they went along for the ride . Tobias and Jagger play a pair of amiable duds , Marlowe is bitter and angry , but Elam is psychotic . Henry Hathaway got good performances in this suspense filled western . Of the outlaws the idiot Jagger in the end has the most sense . See the film to know what I'm talking about .
394789	2483625	26121	7.0	From The Working Class Studio , A Film For The Working Man	During the Thirties Warner Brothers had the reputation of being the working class studio and it was films like Black Fury that made for Warner Brothers that reputation . It was rare indeed to see another studio take stories about ordinary working people . Mostly they concentrated on the middle and upper classes because film was a form of escapism during the Depression . Black Fury coming out as it did in the middle of the New Deal was a timely reminder of the difficulties organized labor faced . Not coincidentally 1935 was the year that the Wagner Labor Relations Act was passed , an effort finally by the government to give labor some kind of equal footing with management . The need of the Wagner Act was to correct some of the abuses shown in films like Black Fury . Paul Muni plays happy go lucky immigrant coal miner Joe Radek . A man admittedly who works hard and no one thinks of as any kind of brain . He gets used good and proper by the company to stir up the miners so they will strike and give the company an excuse to lock out the union and bring in scabs . What you see with those miners living on subsistent wages in company towns was taken right from current headlines . It may be ancient history to us now , but it was very real for those people back in the day . The Pinkertons as represented by brutal and corrupt company policeman Barton MacLane had an unsavory reputation as strikebreakers and enforcers for management . That too is no exaggeration . Muni , aided and abetted by former girl friend Karen Morley now seeing the error of some of her ways , sees what a chump he's been and takes some real direct action against the employers . It's spectacular I'll tell you that . Though his acting style seems to have not worn well with some , not with me mind you , Muni was given a really rare tribute that year . His performance as Joe Radek was the second time a performer had a sustained write-in campaign for him for an acting Oscar . He finished second in the balloting to Victor McLaglen for The Informer and ahead of Mutiny of the Bounty nominees , Clark Gable , Charles Laughton , and Franchot Tone . The following year the Academy banned write-ins and that's been so ever since . Of course the following year Muni won his Oscar for The Story of Louis Pasteur . We've moved on in America from an industrial to an information based society and films like Black Fury are now part of history . But it's a history we should not forget .
396454	2483625	43821	7.0	An English version of Green Acres with uranium .	In one of his last feature films Douglas Fairbanks , Jr . plays American expatriate Donald Drake who has inherited a farm in Sussex where he has brought his new bride to settle . Kind of an English version of Green Acres . His bride is also an American , Yolande Donlon . She's very much like Eva Gabor and there are the English rustic types just like on Green Acres . Yolande goes on a shopping trip to town with their hired hand Jon Pertwee and while waving to him at an auction she accidentally buys five dozen ducks . So far so good , but one of the ducks turns out to lay uranium eggs with a lead shell . In come all the British armed services , quarantining the Fairbanks farm and turning his honeymoon into a nightmare . Adding to their problems the Doug and Yolande are also trapped with Jon Pertwee and their loan officer from the bank , a handyman , and an official from the Agricultural Ministry all of whom happen to be on the premises when the quarantine order is issued . It's an amusing film , nothing terribly spectacular about it . I always enjoy seeing Jon Pertwee in anything . Back when the Doctor Who show was run on American television he was my favorite of all the actors who played the Doctor . Yolande Donlon was competent enough , but if the film had been made five years later , Marilyn Monroe would have been a natural for the part . My only question is , why didn't the British Army just take the ducks instead of quarantining the farm . Because there would have been no film at all .
396817	2483625	26205	7.0	Steaming Up The High Seas	In China Seas , Clark Gable and Jean Harlow essentially take their characters from Red Dust off the rubber plantation and transplant them to the high seas . What's wild about this film is that both Gable and Harlow are supposed to be English , but do not even attempt to adopt an accent . In Gable's case he figured the public accepted him in Mutiny on the Bounty so why not . In any case the part called for a rough and tough adventurer and that certainly did fit Gable . Harlow's a girl who's been around the block a few times and she's crazy about Gable . But Gable takes her for granted and he's now pursuing a cultured widow of a friend in Rosalind Russell . That doesn't sit too well with Harlow so she goes after China trader Wallace Beery who's always had a yen for her . The problem is that Beery is hooked up with Malay pirates , a nasty bunch if there ever was . They're looking to steal some gold bullion that Gable's transporting on this voyage . What happens is the rest of the story . This was one of Rosalind Russell's earliest roles and once again there's little trace of the fine comedic actress she became . She worked with Gable again in They Met in Bombay and the results there were excellent . Here she's being a mannered version of Myrna Loy . MGM did that a lot , had back up players in case stars became hard to handle . In this case that's what they envisioned Russell as at this time . She does well in a part , gets more out of the role than I'm sure was originally intended . Actually my favorite in China Seas is Lewis Stone . He's a former captain himself who was beached for cowardice . Gable signs him on as a third officer and Stone makes himself a human bomb and martyrs himself to save the ship . It's a touching and tragic performance . Russell in her memoirs says that at this time she was not terribly friendly with the MGM star roster while she was an up and coming player in the ranks . One exception she did mention was Jean Harlow who she describes as warm , friendly , and helpful . Not that the two would have been up for the same kind of parts , but I got the feeling Russell felt Harlow was a genuinely nice person . The stars and the supporting cast fill out the roles they are normally type cast in . China Seas is still rugged action adventure entertainment .
394074	2483625	43680	7.0	The U . S . A . of the Cold War	I doubt if a film like It's A Big Country could be made in and about the America of post Vietnam and Watergate . A whole lot of the clichés presented here just aren't bought any more by large segments of the population . For whatever it's worth the film is a presentation of what we thought about ourselves in 1951 . It's a film with several different segments , some serious some pretty funny about every day Americans in all walks of life , in all parts of the then 48 states . The two I liked best were those that ironically starred the two men who were not MGM contract players , Gary Cooper and Fredric March . Gary Cooper plays a Texas cowboy talking about his state and disillusioning us with a tongue in cheek delivery about the way Texans and Texas are perceived by the other 47 states . Of course Cooper's humor and the whole premise behind this segment was that Texas was our largest state in land mass . That ended in 1959 when Alaska became the 49th state , still it's the highlight of It's A Big Country . Fredric March plays an Italian American father who's opposed to his son , Bobby Hyatt , getting needed glasses even after teacher Nancy Davis tells him it's necessary . He's got some old world ideas that need a bit of adjustment . March plays the role with dignity never do you feel he's a caricature . Another episode that is nicely done involves Gene Kelly , Greek American boy falling for Janet Leigh , Hungarian American girl . They've got a problem though , her father played by Hollywood's number one Hungarian S . Z . Sakall . In the past 20 years we've seen a whole lot of stories about ancient ethnic hatreds coming out of Eastern Europe . Sakall is carrying some old grudges against Greeks though he really isn't sure why . Point being that here in America you're supposed to leave that all behind . That segment is still very much relevant . Could we make It's A Big Country today ? Not at this time , maybe at some future point when we've reached a national consensus that despite all our problems , America's a pretty good place after all .
395268	2483625	34922	7.0	Take Your Best Shot At Joseph Cotten	While returning from a conference munitions expert Joseph Cotten and his wife Ruth Warrick are taken to a nightclub in Istanbul by the mysterious Edward Sloane where Cotten is almost killed . Magician Hans Conreid is a victim of his own slight of hand , but it's Cotten who's the target as Orson Welles as the Turkish police inspector deduces . Welles's solution get Cotten out of the country so if he's killed at least it won't be on his watch . Welles books passage on a tramp freighter for Cotten and the freighter is loaded with highly interesting characters , one of whom at least is a Nazi assassin . This was another Mercury Theater production with most of the regulars from Citizen Kane / The Magnificent Ambersons back again . Welles's police inspector is a small , but crucial part of the story . Welles , for whatever reason is being unduly modest . Journey Into Fear is undoubtedly the greatest film that Orson Welles never took credit for directing . I can find certain touches here from Citizen Kane , The Magnificent Ambersons , and The Stranger . If he didn't officially direct you can take it to the bank that Norman Foster knew exactly what Welles was trying to get out of each and every scene . Look also here for a good performance by Mexican cinema great Dolores Del Rio as a most mysterious femme fatale on the freighter . Journey Into Fear is a short film , slightly less than 70 minutes running time . I'm sure that RKO had it playing at the bottom end of double features . Maybe we'll see a ' director's cut ' of this one day and know what Welles's own perspective was .
392689	2483625	34919	7.0	Small scale Casablanca	Joan of Paris is best known for the joint debut of both Michelle Morgan and Paul Henreid on the American cinema . Henreid is a member of the Free French flying with the RAF and he and the crew are shot down over occupied France . Henreid and the group including a wounded Alan Ladd make their way to Paris where he tries to contact either the French underground or any British intelligence operatives . When Henreid came , he came to stay in America , becoming a citizen years later . Morgan made a few films and went back to France after the war where she resumed her star status . She and Jean Gabin are probably the two most well known French players who managed to flee the occupation and continue their careers on foreign soil . Henreid displays all the charm later put to full advantage in Casablanca and Now Voyager . Their romance is tender and all too tragically brief . Like Casablanca , Henreid wants to get back in the fight . Morgan , who's patron saint is Joan of Arc , will sacrifice all to aid him . The best performance in this film is that of 20th Century Fox loan out to RKO , Laird Cregar . Cregar , a clever and epicene occupier who's bulk suggests Herman Goering , is the relentless pursuer of the downed fliers . Alan Ladd scored a notable success as the kid flier although he tries at times to affect a British accent . They should have just made him Canadian as they did all the other American actors who played in British locations and situations . It wasn't as bad as Gregory Peck's in The Paradine Case though . Joan of Paris is a good , but routine product from RKO , one of the minor studios . In her next film Morgan would be opposite that American icon making his feature film role debut , Frank Sinatra in Higher and Higher . Still she and Henreid acquit themselves well , albeit in a minor key .
394539	2483625	104647	7.0	From The Days of the Miners and Forty Niners	If the rather quirky and unique screen personality of Christian Slater is not your cup of tea , than I'd stay away from Kuffs . Reading the film credits before writing this review I learned that Kuffs was written specifically for Slater . I can't see anyone else this role of George Kuffs , amiable high school dropout who can't get his life together and is sponging off his big brother Bruce Boxleitner . Boxleitner is a patrol specialist , an institution dating from the days of the Forty Niners and unique unto San Francisco . There were not enough police to enforce any semblance of law and order in a town that just mushroomed over night . The city fathers assigned specific areas to people to enforce law and order and Boxleitner has one of those districts . But in his area , the merchants are being harassed and extorted and he's being offered a huge bribe to sell his district to some really nasty people . When he doesn't Boxleitner is killed and Christian Slater inherits his job . Despite some really gaping holes in the plot , the film is really carried along quite nicely by Christian Slater . Others in the cast of note are Milla Jovavich as his pregnant girlfriend , Leon Rippy as the hood who murdered Boxleitner and Tony Goldwyn as the SFPD officer assigned to Slater to keep him from getting killed . Still Kuffs is strictly a Christian Slater show and his fans will absolutely love it .
395223	2483625	35798	7.0	What a Fellow Does For a Friend	Randolph Scott and Glenn Ford were once outlaw pals together , but now Scott's a sheriff and young Ford is still hiring his gun out . He gets hired to pull a bank job , but is delayed getting to town and those that hired him get someone else . That leads to all kinds of complications , a lot for a film that's not even 90 minutes long . Randy and Glenn both got girls here . Claire Trevor plays her usual good time gal with a heart of gold . And Evelyn Keyes is the daughter of Edgar Buchanan who falls for Ford big time without realizing who he is or why he came to the town that Scott is the sheriff in . It's B western , but unusual for the time and for Columbia Pictures it was given the full technicolor treatment . The Desperadoes marked Glenn Ford's first film in technicolor , a process reserved only for some of the more expensive films from bigger studios . Harry Cohn was certainly not one to shell out for it . And definitely not during war time . The plot gets a bit convoluted as both Ford and Scott are put to the test of friendship versus expediency / duty . The plot also involves some high class hypocritical skunks in Randy's town who are the real outlaws as far as the film is concerned . The four leads do a fine job and the best supporting performance is Guinn Williams as Ford's lovable explosive lunkhead of a sidekick . The climax involves a cattle stampede and a shootout in the town saloon and is one of the best ever done in a western film . Fans of the four leads and westerns in general will enjoy this one .
392899	2483625	18037	7.0	Walking A Million Miles For One Of Your Smiles	For a mawkishly sentimental play that was outdated even when it first was presented on Broadway , The Jazz Singer has had a remarkable life with now three movie versions and possibly more to come . Of course it being considered the first sound film probably has a whole lot to do with it . I doubt it would have been remade twice already if it wasn't a historical moment . But for trying to hold up the Brothers Warner for some extra salary for doing that first sound feature , Georgie Jessel might have been able to repeat the role he created on Broadway as Jakie Rabinowitz aka Jack Robin , cantor's son who runs away from home as a juvenile and comes back home in time to sing Kol Nidre at Yom Kippur services in place of his dying father . Jessel's greed was Al Jolson's gain as America's greatest live entertainer at the time got to inaugurate the era of movie sound . As Al Jolson was wont to do in his stage shows , he interpolated material from all sources in his first film that he felt was suitable for him . Toot Toot Tootsie and interestingly enough My Mammy were songs he'd done on stage before and were proved material his audience would respond to . The first song he actually does sing is Dirty Hands , Dirty Face which was something he had not done before . Blue Skies which he sings to his mother after returning home as a Broadway star was in fact a current hit on Broadway at the time Jolson was singing it . People from that era say that you cannot appreciate Jolson on the screen , that to really get the full impact of his dynamic stage presence you had to see him live . Maybe so , but since that isn't possible , there's enough of him in The Jazz Singer and other of his films to realize what a great entertainer he was , black-face or not . Warner Oland , later to be the first Charlie Chan , plays Cantor Rabinowitz and Eugenie Besserer is touching as Jolson's mother caught hopelessly between her husband and son . In that first scene of a grownup Jolson in a café before he sings Dirty Hands , Dirty Face you will note that is William Demarest who he's dining with . Myrna Loy has a small role as a chorus girl . Still both the play and the personality dictate that this film is owned exclusively by Al Jolson . Despite later versions with Danny Thomas and Neil Diamond in the lead , the story will always be identified with the man who said we ain't heard nothing yet . Though The Jazz Singer is exponentially sentimental and mawkish , it does have a very nice depiction of Jewish life and neighborhood in the Teens and Twenties of the last century . And of course The Jazz Singer is a historic first .
394893	2483625	175447	7.0	An Erotic Technique That Can't Be Beat	Though the acting from the Royal Shakespeare company is first rate , this version of Antony and Cleopatra is little more than a photographed stage play . And a bit long for the cinema at that . The title roles are played well by Richard Johnson and Janet Suzman . The story has been told three times in contemporary verse in the cinema by Theda Bara , Claudette Colbert , and Elizabeth Taylor as the seductive Queen of Egypt who tried to bend one too many conquerors to her will by use of her legendary charms . William Shakespeare's Mark Antony was a principal character in two of his plays , Julius Caesar where he skillfully picked up the leadership of his late patriarch Caesar and routed the conspirators who assassinated the legendary conqueror . To give legitimacy to his enterprise , Antony was forced into partnership with Octavian Caesar , Julius's grandnephew and a legion commander Lepidus made the triumvir of three . This play is a story of the dissolution of that partnership caused in no small part by Cleopatra . Sex may have more a part in Antony and Cleopatra than in any other work of Shakespeare . Historians might very well argue that Mark Antony was using Cleopatra as his entrée to gaining alliances with various Roman dependencies in a power play against Octavian . But Shakespeare was no doubt titillating his 16th century audience with the tales of Cleopatra's erotic technique . Ahenobarbus , Antony's good friend played here by Patrick Stewart , says that while Octavia's sister's a pretty thing , when you get entangled with Cleopatra , she's so good that men are never satisfied , they keep hungering for more . So that's the reason why Antony instead of tending to business and keeping an eye on Octavian gradually loses support in Rome where it really counts . The guy who was so shrewd in Julius Caesar in Antony and Cleopatra is just a love struck fool . It's the basis for his tragedy . As for Cleopatra , three times wasn't the charm . Julius Caesar and Mark Antony may have succumbed although there is debate about who was using who . But in Octavian as played here by Corin Redgrave is all about business . I was interested in the difference between Ahenobarbus in Cecil B . DeMille's Cleopatra which starred Claudette Colbert and the way Shakespeare writes him and Stewart plays him . In the DeMille film , Ahenobarbus is played by C . Aubrey Smith as a stout old soldier who finds it a matter of conscience to leave Antony and support his beloved Roman Empire which he sees embodied now in Octavian . Patrick Stewart's Ahenobarbus is far more of an opportunist who makes a calculated move at the right time . The money here was spent on talent with the people mentioned and the others in the cast from the Royal Shakespeare Company . Down the cast list you'll find Ben Kingsley in a minor role . Look also for a very touching performance by Rosemary McHale as Charmian , Cleopatra's faithful handmaiden who makes the last journey with her . This version of Antony and Cleopatra is not a movie per se , it lacks the production values of one . The Elizabeth Taylor Cleopatra had the spectacle to go with the acting . This one succeeds on talent alone .
394298	2483625	51688	7.0	A Question of Honor	My vote has always been that of all the great stars identified as western heroes , none was more upright than Joel McCrea . In fact whenever he tried to vary that character , the results usually weren't that good . Even in comedy parts like his films with Preston Sturges , he's still an honorable man , albeit caught up in some lunacy . McCrea never crossed the line into making himself look ridiculous like Dudley Doo-Right and The Gunfight at Dodge City is a case in point . Here he's playing Bat Masterson who has come into Dodge City after a killing in another town and buys an interest in the Lady Gay Saloon owned by widow Nancy Gates . Brother Ed Masterson , played by Harry Lauter is the town marshal and he's keeping company with preacher's daughter played by Julie Adams . Brother Ed is shot in the back during a cowboy hurrahing of Dodge City and Bat steps in to take his place . He brings some law and order back to Dodge City and makes both friends and enemies in the process . And he's got both the women mentioned before interested in him . Fate would have it , a friend from another town comes back in his life . He wants him to bust his brother , who's mentally retarded , out of custody . The brother has killed a man who was making fun of him . He owes this guy big time and he has a responsibility to his badge in Dodge City . I won't say anything , but Joel McCrea never took the less honorable route in his cinematic career . And as for which woman he winds up with ? See the film . Also look for an unusual performance against type from Richard Anderson . Anderson usually plays nice guys and he's best known for being Lee Majors boss in the Six Million Dollar Man . He's a serpentine villain here and a good one . I saw this when I was 12 years old when it was the second feature of a double bill . That's what McCrea westerns were relegated to at that time . But Joel McCrea was a real cowboy hero to this 12 year old . Still is .
393536	2483625	25520	7.0	Connie And Connie	Don't be misled by the title of the film . Moulin Rouge does not take place in Paris at all . It's a pleasant backstage musical comedy story though no one will mistake it for 42nd Street . It gives Constance Bennett a chance to imitate Fifi d'Orsay and play a dual role as twin sisters . Once upon a time Connie and Connie were a sister act . But one Connie went to France and became a big musical French star like a Caucasian Josephine Baker and the other Connie stayed in America and married Franchot Tone . But no one knows American Connie has a twin sister with a decided French accent like Fifi d'Orsay . French Connie's been imported by producer Tullio Carminati to star in his Broadway revue . American Connie wants to get back into show business , but husband Tone isn't having that at all . Anyway French Connie wants a break , so the sisters agree to switch . Of course this causes complications as Franchot is much taken with who he thinks is a French star that bears a fascinating resemblance to his wife and Carminati is on the make himself for her . I think most of you can see where this is going . Like the Busby Berkeley films which Moulin Rouge tries so hard to imitate , the plot is just a flimsy device for the final numbers in the show . The film has two things going for it that make it slightly better than some ersatz Berkeley . The first is the song writing team of Harry Warren and Al Dubin , imported from Warner Brothers and some Berkeley films they were writing . The second is choreographer Robert Muskert who has only two film credits , Moulin Rouge and the Paul Whiteman revue , The King of Jazz . But he's more importantly known as the founder and first choreographer of the New York City Radio Hall Rockettes . Look in that chorus line and you might spot a young Lucille Ball . Bennett gets to sing two great Harry Warren songs . The first is a duet with Russ Columbo later re-prised by the Boswell Sisters , Coffee in the Morning . And the second is that famous torch ballad Boulevard of Broken Dreams . Two decades later Boulevard of Broken Dreams was revived and became a big mega-hit for a young and up and coming singer named Tony Bennett . I have to say Constance Bennett did quite well with both numbers . She also turned in a fine performance . And Franchot Tone got to wear tails again . And you thought he'd get a break from that just cause he was on a loan out from MGM .
396031	2483625	70909	7.0	For $1000 . 00 A Day	You can see the roots both in the plot and the special effects in Michael Crichton's Westworld that can later be found in the incredibly popular Jurassic Park series . Like Jurassic Park the protagonists of Westworld are a pair of wealthy American yuppies who are going to a futuristic vacation resort . The place is called Delos and like Disneyland with its separate theme parks of Fantasyland , Adventureland , Frontierland , and the World of Tomorrow , Delos has three different resort type places to visit , Romanworld , Medievalworld and Westworld . Our two intrepids have chosen the Westworld experience . They get to mix and mingle in an old west frontier town , or at least a Hollywood type version of same and get the feel of western life . Included are gunfights and bar brawls such as you see in any good Hollywood western . This is what Richard Benjamin and James Brolin have chosen for themselves . For reasons unexplained in the story , the whole thing breaks down in all three theme worlds and in the case of Westworld , a very nasty gunslinger robot has shaken loose from his programming and is on the hunt for human targets . Will man with all of his weaknesses defeat an apparently indestructible machine ? You can also see some of the themes in the later Terminator films that Arnold Schwarzneggar popularized . Here the relentless hunter is played by Yul Brynner in the familiar black western garb that he made popular in The Magnificent Seven . The VHS copy of Westworld advertises itself as the very first use of computer graphics . If that's the case this is one unique experience for that reason alone and should not be missed .
394787	2483625	36427	7.0	Knocking the Axe Out Of the Axis	They Got Me Covered is one of two films Bob Hope did on loan out from Paramount to Sam Goldwyn . After that Goldwyn once again signed his own house comedian Danny Kaye so he wouldn't have to pay an exorbitant ransom Paramount put on Hope's talents . Hope's a bumbling newspaper reporter who turned out to be the only wire service man who did not get the story of the German invasion of the Soviet Union . That got him fired by boss editor Donald MacBride in one of his patented movie temper tantrums , If you can believe it Hope actually won a Pulitzer Prize , but we soon learn the reason for it . He's got a Rumanian source named Venescu played by John Abbott . Abbott's got another big story for him , but he manages to get himself killed . Hope and ever suffering gal pal Dorothy Lamour have to find out what happened . This could have been the plot line for any number of melodramatic noir type films , but this is a Bob Hope film so we're talking satire of same . Hope gets a lot of help from a very good cast of players Sam Goldwyn assembled here . Representing the Axis are Otto Preminger , Philip Ahn , and Eduardo Ciannelli plus a very seductive Lenore Aubert as the traditional femme fatale . Best moments for me are those that Hope has with Donald Meek playing an addled old caretaker who believes the Civil War is still going on . The two of them reprise a couple of old burlesque routines in Abbott and Costello style . Also look for a really nice performance by brassy blond Marion Martin as stripper Gloria the Glo-Girl . They Got Me Covered despite the dated World War II topical references still has quite a lot of laughs for today's audience .
393882	2483625	102914	7.0	Updating Of The Squaw Man	The very first film usually dubbed a Hollywood western was Cecil B . DeMille's The Squaw Man which came out in 1913 . The plot involved an English earl going west to America after one of those Victorian affairs of honor and settling down with an American Indian wife . A lot of the plot elements of The Squaw Man are in Showdown at Williams Creek . In this Tom Burlinson is not an earl , far from it he's a British officer who sees a chance for promotion in the 1860s in the army of Great Britain slim because of the custom of purchasing a commission . Ironically enough right at the time he was deciding to head to North America to seek his fortune , the Gladstone ministry and its Secretary for War Lord Cardwell was finally addressing just such abuses . In any event Burlinson goes to America , falls in with some bad companions and one of them leaves him to die with an Indian arrow wound . But he's rescued by a band of Metis , mixed racial descendants of fur trappers and Indians and falls in love with Michelle Thrush one of the women who he has a son by . The story is told in flashback by Burlinson on the stand during a murder trial where he's accused of shooting down Donnelly Rhodes that bad companion he fell in with . As the story unfolds Burlinson being left to die is only part of the reason for the homicide . I first saw Burlinson in his native Australian production of The Man From Snowy River . He gave a good account of himself here as he did there . In that other film , I managed to learn what a ' brumbie ' is , we call them mustangs in the USA . Playing the judge in the courtroom is Raymond Burr who in fact is a native Canadian . I'm sure he was there to encourage independent Canadian film making and lend a little Perry Mason box office to the effort . The film is nicely photographed in British Columbia and if it's broadcast in Canada or in the USA or at the North Pole for Santa Claus , I urge you catch it .
396097	2483625	52617	8.0	Can You Imagine Dickens in Hollywood ?	Beloved Infidel is based on the memoirs of Hollywood columnist Sheilah Graham , specifically her three year affair with F . Scott Fitzgerald , who is still a legend in American literature , and a genuine legend in his own time . That's the key to the film . Can you imagine in the previous century Charles Dickens whose works in the United Kingdom were also acclaimed in his time getting a contract and asked to turn out potboiler drama three or four times a year for the London stage ? In the late 1930s F . Scott Fitzgerald was in Hollywood having to pay mounting bills for his wife Zelda's care and his daughter schooling and the way to quick cash was in Hollywood writing screenplays . But the studios don't want genius , they want entertainment churned out quickly on a mass scale . That isn't how Fitzgerald operates . So he's fired and returns to the alcoholism that was his lifestyle during his literary hey day in the Roaring Twenties . As Fitzgerald , Gregory Peck's one consolation in his final years is the love affair with Hollywood columnist Sheilah Graham . I have to disagree with the other reviewers who say this film is too rosy a portrayal . Remember this is Sheilah Graham's work this is based on and it's through her eyes we see Peck's disintegration . Deborah Kerr is once again a prim and proper Sheilah Graham whose slum background she's worked like a demon to overcome . Peck and Kerr work well together , but as this is a Henry King film from 20th Century Fox , I wouldn't be surprised if the film might have been intended for Tyrone Power at one point . If it had been Power would have been well cast in the part of Fitzgerald . This is also Henry King's next to last film and take a look at his film credits and the astonishing list of classic films that he did over 50 years in Hollywood . I guess as a followup to Beloved Infidel , King chose to do a film adaptation of F . Scott Fitzgerald's Tender is the Night . That one for some reason is never shown . Beloved is a classic old fashioned romantic drama the kind that sadly is not being made any more .
395976	2483625	52427	8.0	" Though He Be No Bigger Than My Thumb "	Unfortunately for the career of Russ Tamblyn he came along just as musicals were being phased out along with the big studio system . But MGM did have Russ under long term contract and there was the fact he had to be used . Tamblyn went to the United Kingdom in 1958 to film tom thumb , one of the Brothers Grimm more interesting fairy tales . As desired by Jessie Matthews after she and husband Bernard Miles waste three wishes granted by the forest fairy June Thorburn , she would love any child sent though the child be a wee one . Of course Tamblyn becomes the joy of their lives and his best scenes are dancing with those animated George Pal Puppetoons . Twenty years earlier , Russ Tamblyn would have been a great musical star , he didn't do half bad coming along when he did . The Puppetoon scenes won for tom thumb an Oscar for Special Effects in 1958 . I remember accompanying my younger siblings to see the film when it opened . Believe it or not the thing I remember best is that scene where Miles races home to tell Matthews about the three wishes . He casually remarks he'd like a sausage and then it appears . And then she just as casually wishes it would grow on his nose and poof there it is . Seeing it today on TCM brought that memory back of the sausage growing on Bernard Miles's nose . Fortunately the kind fairy gave her a heartfelt fourth wish . Alan Young is an earnest if diffident hero who performs a heroic deed and wins mortality and the heart for and of June Thorburn . And Peter Sellers and Terry-Thomas make a wonderful pair of villains who trick Tamblyn into using his small size to rob the king's treasury . And in the Grimm Brothers world of happily ever after , young tom gets a bride of his size . They might have been the ancestors of the gnomes from the Gnomemobile
393774	2483625	1092014	8.0	Bares Resemblance To Anthony Mann / James Stewart Westerns	In Lone Rider Lou Diamond Phillips returns to his small Texas town after war service and looks to settle down with his family . When he left there before the Civil War his parents and cousin had a prosperous ranch and a mercantile in town . But while he's been away , a boyhood friend has become the town boss and is looking to take over the ranch and the mercantile . Lou's father Stacy Keach has borrowed for the store with a loan on the ranch which boyhood friend Vincent Spano wants paid in full . Spano's moving on a few fronts in that town and in the tradition of many westerns the town looks for a champion and Lou fills the bill . Lone Rider reminds me a whole lot of some of the Anthony Mann / James Stewart westerns of the Fifties . Phillips is playing a part that half a century ago Jimmy Stewart would have been playing . In fact there are distinct plot elements from The Far Country and Bend of the River in Lone Rider . And fifty years ago Lone Rider would have been released on the big screen when westerns had more of a market and would have been acclaimed and enjoyed . But for western fans like your's truly , we still enjoy them .
394253	2483625	43030	8.0	Doris and Gordon dust off an old chestnut	No No Nanette , each stage and screen version , of it is one of those items that's going to have an eternal life on stage . This version of it , retitled with the best known number in the show is one of the best tellings of the story of a girl who has to keep saying no to all questions . Tea for Two will be sung as long as people have voices . Doris Day and Gordon MacRae sing a nice version of it here , but the primo version of this song is done by Bing Crosby and Connee Boswell for Decca Records . The whole ensemble performs quite nicely and settles into the roles that we've come to know and love them . Eve Arden as the wisecracking best friend , S . Z . Sakall as the confused old world uncle , Billy DeWolfe as the fussbudget conman producer just settle comfortably into their parts . If on Jeopardy the answer is the most frequent leading man for Doris Day , phrase the question Gordon MacRae . They did four films together and sang beautifully in all of them . Of course in this one Vincent Youmans gave them a great score , but Warner Brothers had a song catalog themselves and Gordon MacRae sings I Only Have Eyes for You and does it well . In fact in a lot of Doris Day's films , the Brothers Warner dusted off some of their old song hits . Gene Nelson appeared in a few Warner Brothers musicals . A very talented dancer , he should have come along when musicals were at their height . He'd be better known today . You can't go wrong with Tea for Two , the song or the film .
395502	2483625	87056	8.0	Scrooge Gets A Wake Up Call	As the celebration of Christmas has evolved through the years , whether one concentrates on the religious or the secular traditions , it is a time when people are supposed to behave a little better to each other . That has somehow slipped past one Ebenezer Scrooge , merchant and money lender in 19th century London . As his nephew points out to his uncle , he doesn't keep Christmas in any way because Scrooge feels the whole thing is humbug . The humanity in Scrooge was driven out long ago , he's a hard case , a whole lot like his 20th Century counterpart , Mr . Potter of Bedford Falls , New York . But as Charles Dickens told this tale , redemption is not too late for any of us and a lonely ghost and three spirits visit Scrooge and show him how . A Christmas Carol is such a timeless holiday classic that we sometimes forget that it is as much a social commentary of 19th century Great Britain as Oliver Twist was . The characters in this film are middle and lower class . The Cratchits are a couple of rungs above the street people in Oliver Twist , but they are having to struggle to stay up there . Still love and happiness radiate their home , no thanks to the guy Bob Cratchit works for . Like George Bailey who did a whole lot of good in his life and just had to be reminded how much , Ebenezer Scrooge needed a wake up call as to the potentiality he still had for doing some good in this old world . Patrick Stewart in his live performances and filmed play has pretty much taken over the part of Scrooge . But George C . Scott captures the old miser pretty well in this film . The meanness of him , but with a trace of sadness that makes us root for him to change . Scott joins a fine tradition of people like Reginald Owen and Alastair Sim who've both done great interpretations of Scrooge . Among the supporting roles I particularly enjoyed David Warner as Bob Cratchit and Edward Woodward as a hearty and stern spirit of Christmas present . According to IMDb this is one of 32 versions of A Christmas Carol made that they have archived and it is one of the best .
393298	2483625	45049	8.0	Dizzy the Great	In a sport that prizes quirkiness and treasures it's characters , one of the greatest of them from the 1930s was pitcher Dizzy Dean . He was so colorful a personality he was probably elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame on the strength of that as opposed to his pitching statistics . After all part of the Dean story is that early end to his career . In the Pride of St . Louis Dan Dailey successfully captures the character of Dizzy Dean , at least the Dean I remember . I'm not old enough to remember him pitching , but I do remember him broadcasting Baseball Game of the Week during the 1960s . For that's part of the Dean story as well , being a pioneer broadcaster on radio and later television . Now that announcers are in the Hall of Fame , there's no question Dizzy belongs there . Jerome Herman Dean was one of a tribe of sharecropper's kids who had very little schooling , but an amazing talent for throwing a baseball at blinding speed . In fact he had a younger brother Paul Dean who was a pretty good pitcher himself . Richard Crenna plays Paul in this film and it's one of his earliest film roles . Paul Dean in real life was a quiet retiring sort who's career was also cut short by injuries . Because of that Crenna isn't given much to work with . During the Dean heyday , sportswriters tried to pin the nickname of Daffy on Paul , but it never took . Joanne Dru , taking a break from playing , western gals in gingham dresses and corsets is first rate as the wise , patient , and understanding Patricia Nash who met and married Dizzy while he was playing for Houston in the Texas League . In the 1937 All Star Game Dizzy started for the National League . Facing Cleveland's Earl Averill , Dean was hit on the foot by a line drive smack at him . Refusing to listen to medical advice , Dean came back to pitch too early . He'd broken a big toe and put too much of a strain on his arm . He was never the same pitcher and his refusal to accept that is part of the story . Had he had a career of say ten to fifteen years who knows what pitching statistics he might have rolled up . Dean was the next to last pitcher to win 30 games in 1934 and after Denny McLain ( who was something of a character himself ) did it 1968 it hasn't been done since . Dean went into broadcasting and while he was not the first former player to go into the broadcast booth , his colorful game descriptions made him an instant hit . He started broadcasting for the other St . Louis team , the Browns , and the Browns were a pretty miserable team with not much to cheer about . Dean became a star attraction there . Of course part of the Dean story is the trouble he got into because of his lack of education and his colorful way of expressing himself on the air . That's part of the story I won't go into , but in the film it's handled with tact and humility and your eyes might moisten if you tend to the sentimental . A fine baseball film , a real tribute to an American success story .
393463	2483625	16804	8.0	The Great Profile As The Great Seducer	Although John Barrymore was 44 when he played the role of Tirso DeMolina's famous libertine , the soft focus photography enabled to look years younger and really do a convincing job as the most famous seducer in fiction . In fact Barrymore plays two roles , the dashing cavalier Don Juan and his stern father who was cuckolded by his wife and imparted some cynical views on women to his young son in a prologue . When the main action of the film gets going it takes place in Rome when the Borgias were running things . Cesare Borgia played by Warner Oland and his evil sister Lucretia who has Estelle Taylor , then Mrs . Jack Dempsey playing her part . They're quite a pair , cruel and sadistic , and they've got a cousin played by Montagu Love who rivals Don Juan in the seducing department . Barrymore is ostensibly in Rome as a student , but he's way too busy with his female conquests for any academics . He and Love have their eyes on the same woman , Mary Astor , who is royalty herself , related to the Orsinis who the Borgias have kicked out of power . That rivalry is what fuels the plot of this film . Director Alan Crosland was obviously influenced by Cecil B . DeMille in directing this film . The sumptuous sets and even more the scenes of debauchery could be found in many a DeMille spectacle . And we don't get DeMille's moralizing with the film either . As for Barrymore he plays the part with the dash and verve of Douglas Fairbanks who later got to play Don Juan , but as a much older man in Faribanks's final film during the sound era . Note the dueling sequence with Love . Warner Brothers for whom this film was produced used some of the same bits in their sound version of The Adventures Of Don Juan with Errol Flynn . There is also a nice bit by Willard Louis as Barrymore's lackey , Pedrillo . Sad that he would die the same year as this film came out . He was quite amusing in the role . Still it's Barrymore's show and quite a show it is . Don Juan is a good chance to see a young John Barrymore at the zenith of his acting talent .
393216	2483625	35979	8.0	Henry Van Cleave , You've Had A Wonderful Life	At the top of the list of Don Ameche's best films , in that first five , Heaven Can Wait is always listed . As a film with that inimitable Ernest Lubitsch touch , how could it miss ? The very dapper an elegant Mr . Henry Van Cleave has arrived at the entrance to the underworld where he feels given the risqué life he's led on earth , he feels he belongs . To convince the Prince of Darkness , Laird Cregar , that he should be his guest for eternity . And he tells him his life story to prove his case . We see Don Ameche at the various stages of his life during this film and the picture we get of him is a very decent man , but one who could not resist a pretty face or a pretty ankle , depending on which order he noticed them . Nevertheless he does meet the girl of his dreams , Gene Tierney , and while she kept him on the straight and narrow , it wasn't without a look here and there to the side . Some of Hollywood's favorite character actors show up in this film which is one of the reasons it's such a favorite . It's hard to pick from a cast that includes Signe Hasso , Spring Byington , Marjorie Main , Louis Calhern , Eugene Palette , Allyn Joslyn , and Charles Coburn any particular favorite . But I'd have to say my favorite is Laird Cregar . There has never been a more cultivated or civilized Satan on the screen before or since . Cregar's performance more than anything else is symbolic of the Lubitsch touch . Heaven Can Wait is an interesting commentary on our system of morals . Don Ameche's character is absolutely sure he's going to hell and if you listened to fundamentalist ministers he sure would be . Apparently for Laird Cregar's place though , if you spread some happiness in life you certainly don't qualify for admission . An interesting criteria , don't you think . Don Ameche is charming , Gene Tierney is beautiful , the script is witty and bright , the direction faultless . Can't do better than that .
394725	2483625	201048	8.0	A Lot Of Faith	Father Flannagan said there was no such thing as a bad boy and founded Boys Town to prove his theory . With only one test case , but a real hard case , priest Cesar Romero has that particular theory tested by young Roger Mobley . Mobley was 14 at the time he made The Runaway and he had done a similar role as a Mexican street kid in Dime With A Halo . Here he's an orphan urchin who sleeps in a room in a barn and hustles for whatever money he can make . All the time he's looking for his father . He stows away in a truck driven by Father Cesar Romero , but gets stopped at the border crossing . The officials of both sides of the border give him over in custody to Romero . Oh , there was another stowaway on the truck , a young puppy that Mobley took with him that turns out to be a greyhound . One fast greyhound to boot . The dog turns out to be Mobley's salvation . The Runaway is a heartwarming boy and his dog story shot completely on location in Tijuana , San Diego and many points in between in the USA and Mexico . On the shelf for 45 years , it just made its debut on television on TCM . I wonder what Roger Mobley must be thinking , 45 years to see what could be his best performance as a juvenile .
395560	2483625	51818	8.0	" And He Goes By The Name of King Creole "	By this time Elvis Presley was a big movie box office name due in no small measure to the astute management of Colonel Tom Parker . I have no doubt that the Colonel got him Michael Curtiz as a director and a top flight supporting cast consisting of Oscar winners like Dean Jagger as the King's father and Walter Matthau as the villain of the piece . And other such outstanding players as Carolyn Jones , Vic Morrow , Paul Stewart , and Dolores Hart . Presley steps into James Dean territory here , had he lived I'm sure Dean would have played the part of Danny Fisher in what would have been a non-musical story or one where Dean's singing would have been dubbed . Danny Fisher is just the kind of troubled youth searching for himself that Dean excelled with in East of Eden and Rebel Without a Cause . In fact in the relationship between Presley and Jagger you can see a lot of the dynamics of Dean's and Jim Backus in Rebel Without a Cause . Elvis has had to go to work because his father has been unable to hold down a job ever since the death of his wife . So's Elvis's sister , Jan Shepard , also had to work . He gets a break in Walter Matthau's club with an impromptu audition , but it's rival owner Paul Stewart who hires Elvis . That sets the stage for a lot of the action to come . For those who are used to seeing Walter Matthau as the lovable grouch starting from The Odd Couple it would surprise many to learn most of his early roles were bad guys . He's an exceptionally nasty bad guy in King Creole . The title song became one of Elvis's early best sellers and it is also the name of the club Matthau owns in the New Orleans French Quarter . Presley has some other good numbers in this film as well . Some other reviewers have mentioned that Elvis should have done more dramatic stuff like King Creole . Maybe he should have , who knows . But I think the point should be made is that first and foremost Elvis was a singing icon , not an acting one . As were the idols of former generations Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra . I don't think Elvis was willing to push himself as player in the same way they were . Neither Crosby or Sinatra also had a manager with as tight a control over them creatively as Colonel Tom Parker . Both Crosby and Sinatra got Oscars , but it was for parts that they knew they could handle and went after , especially Sinatra . Maybe Elvis in the words of another icon , knew his limitations or the Colonel did . King Creole also was one of the first of Harold Robbins's novels to be made into a film . Yet it's never thought of as a Robbins film like The Carpetbaggers or The Betsy . It's an Elvis film , first and foremost . And that's good enough for fans of the King and others .
393366	2483625	51899	8.0	Gary Cooper pinch hits	Man of the West is a fine gritty western with Gary Cooper stepping into the James Stewart parts in those 50s Anthony Mann westerns . Mann and Stewart during the 50s did eight films , five of them westerns . and some of the best westerns ever made . They were on the set of a sixth , Night Passage , when they quarreled and Mann walked out . I'm sure that both The Tin Star and Man of the West were properties that he originally developed with James Stewart in mind . But at least in this one Gary Cooper pinch hits admirably . The key here is incest . Gary Cooper is former outlaw Link Jones trying to live his past down . He's on the way with his town's savings for a schoolteacher . The train is held up by the Doc Tobin gang and while he eludes them in the holdup , he runs into them later on when he's left behind by the train . These aren't just former outlaw compatriots , they're his family . And what a family , the most frightening group of inbreds ever put on screen until Deliverance . From Lee J . Cobb on down , a lovely group of twisted psychos . Cooper is not just running from his past , but from his lineage . The rest of the gang is Robert J . Wilke , Royal Dano , Jack Lord , and John Dehner . Lee J . Cobb is Doc Tobin and though he's 10 years younger than Cooper , he plays his uncle . Along for the ride are fellow train passengers Julie London and Arthur O'Connell . It's an admirable cast . A real downer of a western , but a great classic .
396497	2483625	41847	8.0	A Cop Killing In Los Angeles	Van Johnson plays it a lot rougher than usual when cast as a hardboiled police detective in Scene Of The Crime . He's got reason to be hard in this case . A fellow detective has been murdered , shot down in the mean streets of Los Angeles . The victim had a thousand dollars in his pocket and may have been doing some off duty guard duty for some bookmakers . Which would make the cop and incidentally Van's friend a crooked cop . Which among other things is what Captain Leon Ames wants Van to find out as well as bring in the killer . What Van and his squad uncover is a gang of crooks who are robbing these illegal gambling establishments , be they bookmaking parlors , dice games , poker games , whatever . This case is the main concern of this film , but Johnson has a whole lot of other things on his plate . A partner , John McIntire , who is slowing up with age , a young detective Tom Drake who is learning the ropes as fast as Van can teach him , and his wife Arlene Dahl who would like very much for her husband to get out of the cop business . Two other performances really stand out in this film . First Gloria DeHaven as singer / gangster girl friend who's definitely the most hardboiled character in the film . Her reasons for her actions tread into adult areas that the Code frowned on , but are still implied . Secondly Norman Lloyd you will not forget as one of Van's stool pigeons who might just be missing a whole suit in his deck of cards . Lloyd will definitely make your skin crawl . Scene Of The Crime is a good cop drama , atypical for MGM at that time , but they would soon be doing more of these .
396495	2483625	50631	8.0	Why Am I Gone About Those Girls ?	Cole Porter's final film score and next to last music written for any media is Les Girls . The same team producer Sol Seigal and writer John Patrick who produced and wrote the adaption of The Philadelphi Story for High Society worked with Porter again and this time George Cukor was directing . It's a good film , but I've got the feeling that it could have been a whole lot better . One of the criticisms that Porter used to get annoyed with was the perennial ' it isn't up to Cole Porter's standard ' and then you'd look in the score and see a lot of classics . Can-Can is the best example of that . But in the case of Les Girls Porter admitted this to be true . According to the George Eells biography of Porter , he was starting to suffer the decline in health that would eventually end his life in 1964 . He did have surgery to bypass an ulcer and was not feeling up to par . Still the numbers are mostly for a vaudeville act , Barry Nichols and Les Girls so they're serviceable to a bright Rashomon like plot . The members of the act are Gene Kelly and the girls are Mitzi Gaynor , Taina Elg , and Kay Kendall . Kay's written a memoir that includes an alleged suicide attempt by Elg and she's suing her in an English court . As we get testimony from Elg , Kendall , and Kelly , they all give out with different versions . It's also clear he had his fling with all of them at one time despite his alleged no fraternization policy . Elg has the best ballad of the score , Ca C'est L'Amour which sounds like something that might have been written for Can-Can and discarded . Cole Porter discards are better than a lot of composer's best efforts . The sparkling Kay Kendall was never shown to better advantage on the screen than with You're Just Too Too in a duet with Kelly . And Cole Porter wickedly satirizes Marlon Brando and The Wild One in Why Am I So Gone About That Gal with Kelly and Mitzi Gaynor . In addition to this being Cole Porter's last film score , this film also marks Gene Kelly's last full blown musical . He did do other musical numbers in films like What A Way To Go and Young Girls From Rochefort and Xanadu , but this was the last musical he did . They were getting way too expensive to make , something Kelly learned from behind the camera when he directed Hello Dolly . Even with a score that Cole Porter himself wasn't thrilled with , Les Girls is still a fresh bit of film making . And since it's original to the screen , the Porter wit is not edited severely . All in all four great musical performers , three of them Les Girls .
394420	2483625	41944	8.0	Baseball and Vaudeville	Gene Kelly took this idea to Arthur Freed about an original musical which would combine two big loves of his , baseball and the dance . The story would be based on Al Schacht and Nick Altrock who played ball during the regular season as pitcher and catcher and then in the off season toured in vaudeville . So Take Me Out to the Ballgame was born . In fact the song Take Me Out to the Ballgame was written during that era of Theodore Roosevelt . But instead of a battery , the story revolved around a double play combination of Gene Kelly , Frank Sinatra and Jules Munshin . Right in the same Teddy Roosevelt era the famous double play combination of Tinkers to Evers to Chance was doing great things for the Chicago Cubs . So it seems natural that a nice novelty number of O'Brien to Ryan to Goldberg seemed in order for this film . Vaudeville and baseball are not complete strangers either . During the previous century Michael ' King ' Kelly , colorful star catcher and base stealer for the Cubs toured in vaudeville . Rube Marquard the number two pitcher for the New York Giants in the second decade of the last century married musical comedy star Blossom Seeley and toured with her as part of her act before they broke up . In fact the original idea in Take Me Out to the Ballgame was to have Leo Durocher play the Jules Munshin part . Of course it would have been a lot different role then . Durocher hung out with a lot of show business types , one of his best friends was George Raft . That got him in some trouble , but that's a story for another film . Kelly and Sinatra essentially play the same roles they did Anchors Aweigh . Sinatra doesn't get as many good numbers as he did in that film , but he does have a very nice ballad , The Right Girl for Me who he thinks might be Esther Williams as he sings it to her . Of course Betty Garrett gets in the picture and she has some different ideas . Esther Williams was not kind to Gene Kelly in her memoirs . She gets only one brief dip in a pool in a one piece bathing suit that was just being popularized at the time of this film by Annette Kellerman . Of course Esther later played Annette Kellerman in another film . She had a lot of trouble with the dance numbers because as she explained it , the muscles one develops for swimming are not the same as those needed for dance and she was really as she describes cruelly razzed by Kelly and Stanley Donen . She grew to dislike him intensely . Kelly's best number is The Hat Me Father Wore on St . Patrick's Day , a nice Irish jig number that he does with style . Busby Berkeley directed the film , but the kind of mammoth musical number that typifies his work is only seen in the ensemble song , Strictly USA . The plot involves some gamblers trying to fix the pennant race against the heavily favored Brooklyn Wolves , Kelly and Sinatra's team . Edward Arnold is the number one fixer . As we well know , gambling and baseball weren't strangers back in the day . Players were hardly paid what they are today and in the days before Kennesaw Mountain Landis became the first Commissioner , fixes were talked of in hushed tones . Kelly gets tricked and tempted . Take Me Out to the Ballgame , the first good musical film on baseball , a harbinger for Damn Yankees and nice entertainment .
394512	2483625	59245	8.0	Go Forth To All the Nations	When first released George Stevens's version of the Gospel was dismissed as too long , too reverential , too soon after the sound version of The King of Kings was released , and too many stars in the cast taking one's attention from the story . Too some degree that is true , but being a stargazer myself I'll never find fault with a film for that . And who knew in 1965 that we would get The Last Temptation of Christ and the Passion of the Christ in our future . George Stevens's film is looking pretty good now . No doubt about the presence of a whole lot of movie names helped bring in the bucks . But with one glaring exception you do pay attention to the roles , not who's playing them . Some parts are pretty substantial . Charlton Heston as John the Baptist has the longest amount of screen time other than Von Sydow . Also given a large amount of time is Jose Ferrer as Herod Antipas , Telly Savalas as Pontius Pilate , Dorothy McGuire as the Virgin Mary and Donald Pleasance as the Prince of Darkness . The personification of the Devil is something Mel Gibson borrowed for his film . Personally I think Donald Pleasance is quite a bit better than what Gibson did . Other stars had smaller roles . Sidney Poitier played a silent part as Simon of Cyrene who helped Jesus with his cross on the way to Calvary . You could not have gotten away with an all white cast in a film like this by 1965 . A whole group of players from previous Stevens films got some bit parts and more like Van Heflin , Shelley Winters , Sal Mineo , and Ed Wynn . One star Joseph Schildkraut had the rare distinction of playing in both Cecil B . DeMille's silent King of Kings and this film . Schildkraut played Judas for DeMille and is seen as Nicodemus here . This was Schildkraut's last film . An interesting double distinction for a man who came from a prominent Jewish theatrical family . One big glaring error though . Stevens should never have cast John Wayne as the Roman Centurion who supervising the crucifixion . Wayne is seen in passing through out the journey to Calvary , but with no dialog . At the moment of Jesus's death with the drama unfolding it was just wrong to have that recognizable a voice utter , " truly that man was the son of God . " Instead of concentrating on the story the audience gets distracted and in the theaters the whispers went up with ' ooh , that's John Wayne . ' Arizona served as the location for ancient Judea . Unlike DeMille in The Ten Commandments , Stevens concentrated on the beauty of the location as opposed to filling the screen with people . It got filled enough with the story . You might recognize the Grand Canyon as the backdrop for the sermon on the mount scene . Of course Handel's Messiah is almost obligatory for these films and it's done well here . One scene that you will not forget comes at the end of the first act , the raising of Lazarus who is played by Michael Tolan . His sisters , Mary and Martha , are played by Ina Balin and Janet Margolin . They had shown Jesus and the disciples hospitality earlier . When Lazarus is taken ill , Mary and Margaret , go after Jesus to bring him back . It is too late , Lazarus has died and he's in his tomb . Or so everyone thinks . The sparse dialog , the photography , and the background music are so well done at this point the most hard hearted nonbeliever will pause . Of course most of the name players in The Greatest Story Ever Told are no longer with us so the cameos don't mean as much today . It is probably better in that an audience of today can concentrate on the story without even the most minimal interference of recognition . And they can concentrate on the story without either alternate realities as in The Last Temptation of Christ or all the gore and violence of Mel Gibson's epic . Definitely worth a look by today's contemporary audience .
394904	2483625	87892	9.0	There'll Always Be a Raj - - - - - - - NOT	A Passage Through India tells a story about the radicalization of a native Indian who happens to be a Moslem . This was in the days before the idea of a separate Pakistan took hold in the independence movement . Victor Bannerjee plays Dr . Aziz Ahmed and as you see by his title he's a professional man . But he's still looked down upon by most of the British who are ruling India . He's befriended by Peggy Ashcroft who is visiting India with her daughter-in-law to be , Judy Davis . Peggy's son is a magistrate . Bannerjee is also friends with James Fox who is an administrator at a local college . He's warned against fraternizing with the British by his friends and family , but Bannerjee goes on a picnic with Ashcroft and Davis and Davis has a horrifying experience in the historic caves at Marabar . It's only her claustrophobia acting up , but Bannerjee winds up accused of rape . And his trial becomes a cause celebre for the Congress Party . Note that Bannerjee has two defense attorneys , a Moslem and a Hindu . E . M . Forster who wrote A Passage to India brought two elements of his background to the writing of this novel . He served as a private secretary to a local maharajah so he knew the customs of India as well as the political scene . Most in the United Kingdom wanted to see India free after World War I . A few very powerful folks like Winston Churchill and some influential press lords , most prominently Lord Beaverbrook did not . There opposition kept India a British colony until after another World War . Secondly Forster was a closeted gay man . His homosexuality was not publicly revealed , he wasn't ' outted ' until after he died in 1970 . One of his relationships was with a Moslem Indian who died at a young age . He's the model for Dr . Aziz . The India Forster writes about is not Rudyard Kipling's India . A place where the native population is made to feel like outsiders . Forster identified with them in a way Kipling could never conceive . Peggy Ashcroft won a Best Supporting Actress Award for her role as the kindly Mrs . Moore . I've got a sneaking suspicion that Forster modeled her character on his own mother who lived with him until she died in 1945 . Judy Davis got a nomination for Best Actress and A Passage to India was nominated in a whole bunch of technical categories . A Passage to India is a disturbing look at a bygone era in a place where you can see a lot of the problems we face today being nurtured .
395914	2483625	105323	9.0	A Generation Gap Of Values	In Scent of a Woman Young Chris O'Donnell at the Baird Prep School on a scholarship , has to earn the money he needs for a round-trip back to Oregon to see his family at Christmas break . He takes a job posting off a bulletin board at school advertising for a companion to a blind man . The blind man turns out to be Al Pacino whose sister and her family want to unload him so they can go away for Thanksgiving . Pacino is no helpless invalid however . He's a former lieutenant colonel in the army and used to being obeyed on command . But he's facing a crisis in his life , he's just tired of being an invalid and dependent on people . O'Donnell's having a crisis too . Headmaster James Rebhorn feels he and another student , Philip Seymour Hoffman , saw an act of vandalism committed on the school grounds . It goes against O'Donnell's grain to be an informant . But these other kids , Hoffman included come from old money and can buy their way out of most things . If the ax has to fall as Pacino tells him , it's going to fall his way . The film is a touching story involving a generation gap of values that is bridged when Pacino and O'Donnell discover a genuine respect and affection for each other . Pacino's iconoclastic retired Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade finally won for him an Oscar for Best Actor that his peers had not voted him , despite being nominated 7 previous times in both the lead and supporting categories . In fact that same year Pacino was also up in the Supporting Actor category for Glengarry Glen Ross . Chris O'Donnell had a breakout performance as the young preppie who has far more integrity than his richer and more privileged classmates . And Philip Seymour Hoffman is great as the kid who rats under the financial umbrella of daddy's millions . Scent of a Woman is a great part for Al Pacino , not my favorite role for him . That one for me is . . . . And Justice For All . Still this award like the one given to Paul Newman for The Color of Money is more for Pacino's lifetime of artistic achievement in the cinema . And that's one artistic life anyone could envy .
396733	2483625	53221	9.0	" You Can Do Just About Anything You Want To , Chance . "	Howard Hawks initially wanted to reunite John Wayne and Montgomery Clift who had worked so well together in Red River in his second film with Wayne . Clift however was at the beginning of the slide that would ultimately destroy him in seven years and said no . It was then that Dean Martin was cast as John Wayne's alcoholic deputy . By the way if Clift had done the part it would have reunited him with Walter Brennan also who is playing a very similar part to the one he did in Red River in relation to Wayne . In the wordless beginning of Rio Bravo , Wayne while going into the town saloon to fetch Dino , witnesses a cold blooded killing perpetrated by Claude Akins . Akins is the no good brother of rich rancher John Russell who keeps trying to spring Akins from Wayne's jail . He also brings in some hired guns who bottle the town up . Both Howard Hawks and John Wayne absolutely hated High Noon and made Rio Bravo as their answer to it . This sheriff doesn't go around begging for help from the townspeople he's sworn to protect . He's supposed to be good enough to handle the job himself with some help from only a few good men . Dean Martin said that the Rio Bravo role for him was one of the most difficult . At that time he was playing a drunk on stage and was not yet into the substance abuse problems that beset him later on . But turns in a stellar performance . This film marked the farewell feature film performance of Ward Bond who took some time from his Wagon Train TV series to play the small role of a Wayne friend who offers to help and gets killed for his trouble . Fitting it should be in the starring film of his best friend John Wayne . The only bad note in Rio Bravo is that of Ricky Nelson who is too much the nice kid from Ozzie and Harriet to suggest being a young gun . But Rio Bravo marked the first of many films Wayne used a current teenage idol to insure box office . Later on Frankie Avalon , Fabian , Bobby Vinton all the way down to Ron Howard in The Shootist brought a younger audience in for the Duke . James Caan who played the Ricky Nelson part in El Dorado was much superior to Nelson . Then again , Caan is an actor . But I will say that Dean and Ricky sung real pretty . When you hear Dean singing My Rifle , Pony , and Me in the jailhouse , you might recognize the same melody from Red River as Settle Down . Dimitri Tiomkin wrote it and Dean recorded it as well as the title song for Capitol records . At Capitol Dino did mostly ersatz Italian ballads , it was what he was identified with . When he switched to Reprise , Dino started doing far more country and western and it really starts with the songs he did in Rio Bravo . Rio Bravo is a leisurely paced western , probably one of the slowest John Wayne ever did . But Howard Hawks created some characters and a story that hold the interest through out .
395603	2483625	53143	9.0	We All Live In A Pink Submarine	In Tony Curtis's filmed tribute to Cary Grant for TCM he made much of his well known idolatry of the man who made him want to become an actor . As a kid growing up in the mean streets of New York , young Bernie Schwartz saw in Cary Grant all he ever wanted to be up there on the silver screen . During naval service on board a submarine in World War II he got to see Cary Grant in Warner Brothers Destination Tokyo . As Curtis said , life has a funny way of working things out . What happens ; Tony Curtis gets to star with Grant years later in a World War II service comedy that is set aboard a submarine . Destination Tokyo was not one of Grant's best films , but Operation Petticoat definitely is . Right after World War II starts , Grant's new ship , the Tigerfish is sunk right in her berth in a remote Pacific Island . Grant persuades Admiral Robert Simon to make whatever repairs he can and try and get the ship back to Pearl Harbor for repairs . Among other things Grant gets is a new officer Tony Curtis who hasn't exactly seen much sea duty , but he's quite the operator . The two develop quite an interesting relationship on the voyage . And it's one thing after another on that memorable shakedown cruise back to Pearl Harbor . But Cary Grant is as unflappable and charming as ever , though even he seems a bit put out at times . There are some pretty hilarious moments in Operation Petticoat , the sinking of a truck , the painting of the Tigerfish pink and then having to leave it that way until Pearl Harbor . And who can forget how they are saved from friendly fire at the climax of the film . Operation Petticoat was one of the biggest commercial and critical hits that Cary Grant had in Hollywood . Coming right after North By Northwest it could well be argued this was the high point of his career . The film holds up very well today , I think today's audience would laugh just as hard as they did in 1959 .
393016	2483625	52896	9.0	" Cause He's Got High Hopes "	A Hole in the Head is based on a Broadway play that ran for 156 performances during the 1956 season by Arnold Schulman . So popular and enduring has it proved that a full musical version was done on Broadway in 1968-1969 that starred Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gorme in the parts done here by Frank Sinatra and Eleanor Parker . High Hopes didn't make it to Broadway , but the song I've Got To Be Me was introduced there by Steve Lawrence and made popular by fellow Rat Packer Sammy Davis , Jr . In Frank Capra's autobiography he says that Schulman was not happy with the change of characters from Jews to Italians , but Capra brought him around to his point of view on this and other things . The ending in the film version is not as upbeat as in the original play . Capra had heard a lot of stories about how disagreeable Sinatra could be to work with , but he says that Sinatra was nothing , but cooperative during the entire work . His biggest difficulty was the fact that Sinatra likes to do things in one take because he becomes bored with repeated efforts . Whereas Edward G . Robinson likes to go over things repeatedly until it was perfect . Capra did work out a compromise where Robinson did his rehearsing , but without Sinatra . The story is about a widower who owns a ramshackle motel in a not popular area of Miami Beach and he's got money problems . Sinatra as the widower also has a son , Eddie Hodges and they are devoted to each other . Edward G . Robinson and Thelma Ritter are his brother and sister-in-law who are visiting from New York and Sinatra is hoping for a touch from him . Robinson's bailed him out a few times and he puts a lot of conditions on future help . Like maybe a remarriage for instance and Ritter tries to hook him up with an old friend , Eleanor Parker . They actually hit it off . But there's still a whole lot of complications . High Hopes which is sung by Sinatra and Eddie Hodges sold a few platters for Frank back in 1959 and won the Oscar for best movie song . Sinatra also sings All My Tomorrows over the opening credits and that song did not catch on at first . Later in the mid Sixties , Sinatra recorded it again this time for his own Reprise label , before it had been done for Capitol as had High Hopes and this time it became a minor hit for him . It's quite a poignant ballad . Keenan Wynn has a small , but important part as a real estate kingpin promoter who came down with Sinatra to Miami Beach , but made a big success . Sinatra also tries to hit him up with not so good results . Funny thing is that his big idea was a Walt Disney like park for Florida and life imitated art there , though the park got located in the Orlando area . Frank Sinatra is not as noble as some of Capra's populist heroes , but he's also down to earth and likable . It's one of his best screen performances in one of his best films . Though I have to say with that red hair Eddie Hodges looked a whole lot more like Eleanor Parker's son than Frank's .
394844	2483625	52902	9.0	The Section Hand and The Croker	John Wayne's been given a critical job to do by none other than General Ulysses S . Grant . He's been ordered to take 3 brigades deep into Confederate territory and destroy a critical rail supply station at a place called Newton's Station and then get his troops out the best way he can . He's ordered to take along , an army surgeon played by William Holden . Wayne's got what appears to be an unreasoning dislike of Holden and their rivalry professional and personal is what drives the plot of the Horse Soldiers . John Ford always disparaged the films he made after Wings of Eagles , but in my opinion , The Horse Soldiers is one of his finest films . Also in my humble opinion he managed to get one of John Wayne's finest film performances . Wayne's a volunteer officer , in civilian life he rose from section hand on a railroad to an construction engineer . Holden calls him " section hand " as a term of derision after Wayne consistently refers to him as " croker . " Wayne and Holden were very close personal friends and friendly rivals at the box office . That's part of the reason that The Horse Soldiers is so good , the chemistry between them . In fact when Wayne died in 1979 , Holden was said to have gone on one legendary drinking binge . Who would have suspected we'd have lost him as well two years later . Holden as the doctor has a less flamboyant part than Wayne , but he makes the most of what he was given . I suspect knowing the relationship between Wayne and John Ford , he knew going in his part would be less , but he did it anyway . Anyone who thinks John Wayne incapable of acting should see the scene in the saloon at Newton's Station after the Union forces repel a Confederate attack and are about their business destroying the railroad property . In a great drunk scene he reveals to Constance Towers the reason for his hatred of the medical profession . I won't reveal it , but it's something we can all understand . Wayne did this scene so well that Ford used an abbreviated version of it in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance . Ford makes marvelous use of music in there , weaving traditional Civil War era songs with the song written by Stan Jones for the film , I Left My Love . That is one catchy and infectious ballad , one of the best things written for a John Ford movie . Incidentally Stan Jones makes a brief appearance in the film as Ulysses S . Grant and does well by him . There are two in the supporting cast that deserve mention . During the Civil War Lincoln had to deal with volunteer political generals , most of whom were a flop . Willis Bouchey playing John Wayne's co-commander in the expedition captures the phenomenon to perfection . He's argumentative , arrogant , and a general pain in the butt to Wayne . It's probably Bouchey's finest screen performance . And Carleton Young also gives what I think is his finest screen performance as the one armed Confederate colonel who tries in vain to stop Wayne from completing his plans . It's a role that requires dignity and strength and Carleton Young is marvelous . In fact the contrast between Bouchey and Young as soldiers is pretty obvious . The relationship between the Section Hand and The Croker evolves during the running time of The Horse Soldiers . It's a relationship well worth seeing develop .
393062	2483625	60200	9.0	Never Outfox The Fox	After The Fox finds Peter Sellers and his then bride Britt Eklund working in Italy for director Vittorio DeSica . In it Sellers plays a criminal who if he's not quite a master at the crime trade , at least he's not a bumbler like Inspector Clousseau . The laughs Sellers gets in After The Fox come at the expense of others . A robbery of gold bullion has occurred in Egypt and Interpol is on the case . As we learned in The Lavender Hill Mob , gold bullion is not that easy to transport . Taking on the job of getting it into Europe after he's broken out of jail once again is Peter Sellers . How to do it ? Right out in the open during the course of shooting a movie about a heist . Sellers pretends to be a director and gets the a whole coastal village in on his scheme . After all , who doesn't want to be in the movies ? Part of Sellers plan is to convince over the hill American movie actor Victor Mature to star in his film . After The Fox was Mature's first film in five years , at this point in his life he worked when he felt like it . Mature was one of the least vain of all film stars , how many will say that he's no actor and have 63 pictures to prove it . He looked like he was having a ball satirizing himself and several of his colleagues still pretending they're leading men . Britt Eklund is Seller's girl friend and Akim Tamiroff is the guy who pulled off the gold heist . Maria Gracia Buccella has an unforgettable part as Tamiroff's sister and ' the bikini trap ' . This woman in a bikini makes Sophia Loren look flat-chested . Martin Balsam also has a good role as Mature's exasperated agent . To see what happens if the budding film director can really smuggle some gold into Italy you have to see After The Fox . It's one of Peter Sellers best films and you've got to love Victor Mature for what he does with his own image here .
393013	2483625	426470	9.0	Yugoslavia Tears Itself Apart	I saw this film tonight at the Image Out Film Festival in Rochester and what I saw is a powerful story about both love and hate reaching across ethnic and religious boundaries . The love is what Mario Drmec and Tarik Filipovic have for each other . Same sex couples have it bad enough there , but in this case Mario is a Moslem from Bosnia and Tarik is a Serb . The story is told to us in flashback by Mario being interviewed by a French journalist played by Jeanne Moreau . As Yugoslavia breaks apart the various ethnic groups resume all their ancient hatreds and start killing each other with vehemence as we all read in the Nineties . Mario in order to pass into the Christian Serbian area goes into drag . It seems as though the Christians check out the privates of all the males and if they're circumcised as Moslems have to do as well as Jews they're summarily shot . The ruse works , but the lovers have to continue the masquerade when they get to Tarik's village . Or at least until a helpful friend can obtain the necessary documents to go west to the other side of the Rhine in Europe . Of course when someone does discover the ruse there are unforeseen consequences . Yugoslavia itself was a creation of western European fatuity . Serbia was on the Allied side of World War I and they got a kind of hegemony over a whole lot of territory formerly belonging to both the Hapsburg and Ottoman Empires . At Versailles the Serb king was made monarch over the whole polyglot nation and after World War II , a very charismatic leader named Josip Broz Tito led an independent Marxist / Socialist government . When Marshal Tito died , the country itself died . Held together by an extraordinary man the one thing Tito did not do was solve any ancient hatreds . What happens here happened all over what was Yugoslavia , only this story has gay angle to it . Love , even same sex love can bridge all kinds of boundaries if we're open to it . The friend who is helping the lovers urges them to go west to western Europe where they can live free and prosper . All they have there is ethnic hatred . One other very valuable lesson here is that the film does focus on the atrocities of the Serbs and the Bosnians . Remember this is now a decade where admittedly Moslems are doing some horrible things in many parts of the globe . I am glad that the villain here is not one religion , but a fanatical fundamentalist interpretation of any religion with which people can justify all kinds of barbarism . Ahmed Imamovic the director has received death threats from all sides in the former Yugoslavia for even creating a story involving gay people there . The man has risked his life for this powerful story , buy a ticket and don't miss it .
394277	2483625	36126	9.0	Garson and Pidgeon , A Perfect Fit	For their third MGM collaboration , Walter Pidgeon and Greer Garson were cast as Pierre and Marie Curie in this epic biographical drama about the first woman to win a Nobel Prize in science . The Curies contribution to science was a newly discovered element radium which did nothing less than alter how we think about matter itself . The film carries the story of Marie Curie's life when she was a young student at the Sorbonne from Poland under her maiden name of Sklodowska . The mere fact she was a student there and a brilliant one was highly unusual for women in the 19th century . Her brilliance attracts the attention of young instructor there Pierre Curie , first her mind and then her heart . Pierre and Marie Curie seem such a perfect fit for each other mainly because Pidgeon and Garson worked so well together on screen . Both got nominations for Best Actor and Actress for 1943 , repeating what they had done for Mrs . Miniver in 1942 . This was Pidgeon's second and last nomination . They lost to Paul Lukas and Jennifer Jones in their respective categories . The film itself was nominated for Best Picture but lost to Casablanca . What I like most about Madame Curie is that you don't need a degree in physics to understand what's happening . The actors , the direction by Mervyn LeRoy and the script all are at their best . Look for up and coming MGM stalwarts like Robert Walker and Van Johnson to play brief roles . Easy to tell why both became stars . I think Madame Curie and her husband would both have liked the way they were portrayed in this film .
396812	2483625	35896	9.0	The Bell Tolls for Republican Spain	Ernest Hemingway was most particular about how is work should be portrayed on screen . He had hated the version of A Farewell to Arms that was done ten years earlier . What he did like was Gary Cooper's portrayal of a Hemingway hero . He and Cooper got to be good friends , so he was Papa's first and only choice to be Robert Jordan in For Whom the Bell Tolls . The novel grew out of Hemingway's experience in the Spanish Civil War that raged for almost four years . A number of generals not liking the leftist trend the new Spanish Republic was taking pulled a military coup d'etat . The whole world took sides with the Soviet Union aiding the Republic's defenders and Italy and Germany aiding the Nationalist Generals . The USA was officially neutral , but people had their opinions . Believe it or not many supported the rebelling generals seeing them as upholding traditional Catholic Spain . But some in America organized the Abraham Lincoln Brigade , a group of volunteers who fought for the Republic . Some in there were U . S . Communist Party members , but a whole lot were idealists . All of them had a lot of difficulty after World War II , for shall we say being to prematurely anti-Fascist . Gary Cooper plays just such a volunteer and he's got a mission , to blow up a key bridge in the Guadarrama mountains . He makes contact with the guerrilla band of Akim Tamiroff and Katina Paxinou . Of course fighting with them is Ingrid Bergman , so we had some romantic interludes there which steamed up the screen . This was quite a year for Ingrid , she did Casablanca as well that year and her name became synonymous with romance . She was not the first choice here . Director Sam Wood did not like his original leading lady Vera Zorina and replaced her with Bergman who he really wanted in the first place . In fact Wood was a second choice . Paramount originally scheduled this film for Cecil B . DeMille . I'm betting there were some creative differences between DeMille and Papa Hemingway . If this had become a DeMille type film , it would have been a disaster . Gary Cooper , Ingrid Bergman , Akim Tamiroff , and Katina Paxinou all got Academy Award nominations . Only Paxinou won the Oscar for this film . A great performance , but also probably a tribute to her refugee status . She had fled her native Greece when the Nazis took over where she was a leading member of their national theater . She accepted her Oscar in memory of her late colleagues there . The only criticism of the film came from those that thought it lingered too long on Cooper and Bergman's romance . Something by the way they were having in real life as well . But Ernest Hemingway liked the film just fine and I think most will as well .
393512	2483625	51433	9.0	Losing A Moral Compass	John Wayne's Ethan Edwards , Jimmy Stewart's Howard Kemp , or any number of roles Kirk Douglas has played have nothing of the intensity of Gregory Peck's Jim Douglas in The Bravados . Peck is perfect casting for the part because he's playing against type . If Atticus Finch's wife had been a homicide victim , I think this is how we would see him . Totally lose a moral compass and become a relentless stalker . It's what makes The Bravados work , because we identify Gregory Peck with an innate decency . Peck's house was robbed and his wife raped and murdered by intruders . Peck has a line on them , they're four killers who've been caught and scheduled to hang for a bank robbery in a town several miles away where a bank teller has been killed . But they escape with the help of the hangman , Joe DeReda soon to become a stooge . These are a quartet of the nastiest villains ever , Stephen Boyd , Albert Salmi , Lee Van Cleef , and Henry Silva all of whom have played villains with relish on the big screen . One of them , Boyd , in fact is a rapist , they take young Kathleen Gallant the daughter of the town's dry goods merchant along as a hostage . Charles Bronson never executed bad guys with as much relish as Peck did . They are convicted murderers who've escaped , there's no law to answer to . Peck may be doing some public service homicides , but there's a higher law he must answer to for the preservation of his own soul . In fact the ending brings quite a twist to the tale . The Bravados is one of six films directed by long time 20th Century Fox director Henry King who is most known for doing nine films there with Tyrone Power . In fact the first couple that Peck did were probably properties that were meant for Power , but Darryl Zanuck switched them for his new up and coming leading man . This one however is all Gregory Peck's film , I'm not sure Power could have done a better job . Peck gets some able support from the villainous quartet and from Joan Collins as an old flame he finds that has settled in the town the four have savaged . Special mention should go to Andrew Duggan as the priest in the town where apparently everyone is Catholic . Duggan does a good job as the padre who gives just the right spiritual advice and counsel to a troubled soul . Themes like rape were not exactly subject matter for westerns before the Fifties . The Bravadoes succeeds both as Saturday matinée shooting and as serious adult drama . It shouldn't be missed when broadcast .
393233	2483625	59675	9.0	Returning to the Primitive	I'm really gratified to find so many other reviewers having good memories of Sands of the Kalahari and feeling as put out as I do that it is not on VHS or DVD . Nor apparently has it been seen in America at least for some time . This is a tale of survival , but the characters sure don't come out of Swiss Family Robinson . A small plane crashes in the Kalahari desert in South Africa . One woman , Susannah York , and five men . Only one of them Stuart Whitman who is a big game hunter is really trained for the business of survival . The others are products of the ease and comfort of civilization . One of them , Stanley Baker , is badly injured and needs constant nursing by York . There's a colony of baboons nearby and Whitman starts identifying with them in every sense of the world . He turns on the others , eliminating them one by one except York who he decides will be his savage Eve to his savage Adam . The injured Baker gradually heals and in the end proves to be the savior for York . I'm not going to say any more , but hopefully TCM or AMC will run this film at some point for American audiences . Susannah York is beautiful and talented and goes through a gamut of emotions regarding Whitman and their predicament . Stanley Baker is a favorite of mine among British players , he never gave a bad performance in any film I ever saw him in . But the real treat is Whitman . His devolution of character out in that desert was Oscar caliber material and why he wasn't nominated in 1965 is a mystery . If some American movie channel gets a hold of this film , do not miss it .
393997	2483625	70748	9.0	Adjustments	Summer Wishes , Winter Dreams casts Joanne Woodward as a woman going through mid-life crisis in her forties , realizing that she's settled and not selected in her choice of husband and life . Not that husband Martin Balsam is not a good man , he's a decent enough fellow , an optometrist and back in my parents generation such a guy would have had their mothers pushing their daughters toward him . But Joanne's true love was killed in World War II and Balsam was a guy she settled for . What brings all her anxieties to a head is the sudden death of her mother Sylvia Sidney while both women were having an afternoon of lunch and a movie . Life seemed a lot more simple back growing up on Sylvia's Connecticut farm . With a second choice husband , a daughter Dori Brenner who's not on the best of terms , a son played by Ron Richards who is gay and living in Amsterdam with another man and only seen in dream sequences , it seems like life is closing in on her . Balsam's sees what's happening to his wife and maybe this optometrist's convention in London is a great excuse for a tax deductible European trip where maybe things can be rekindled . This film is short on plot , but long and deep on characterization with some great women's roles for actresses who've past their ingénue days . Summer Wishes , Winter Dreams got Joanne Woodward an Oscar nomination for Best Actress and for movie veteran Sylvia Sidney for Best Supporting Actress . Joanne lost to Glenda Jackson for A Touch of Class , both of those women were going for a second Oscar and Jackson lucked out . What was a real shame was Sylvia Sidney not winning and losing to Tatum O'Neal for Paper Moon . Those supporting categories have become a really good place to honor veterans like her who have moved on to character parts . Don Ameche's award for Cocoon is a great example and I wish Sylvia had gotten this one , for her great performance here and the work of a lifetime . Summer Wishes , Winter Dreams is a poignant film . The best scenes in it are dealing with Sidney's surviving family and how Joanne wants to hold on to the family homestead when all the rest want to sell . She can't articulate to her family why she feels she could cling to her childhood as embodied in that farm , but we the audience feels what she feels , especially those of who've had a similar experience . For me it was nothing like Woodward's in the film , but I had to face selling our family home in Brooklyn in 1997 . The only survivors of my family were my brother and myself and I had my pangs as Joanne did . Three family members of mine died in that same home . What she was able to convey is the mark of a great actress . Summer Wishes , Winter Dreams gives lie to the idea that they don't write some great parts for the female gender .
396253	2483625	44079	9.0	Criss-Cross	In Strangers On A Train , it's obvious from the start that playboy wastrel Robert Walker has singled out Farley Granger as an unwilling accomplice to a pair of murders . Granger's a semi-public figure , he's a tennis pro , but not an especially high one . High enough however for him to know that Granger is trapped in a loveless marriage and would like to be free to marry Ruth Roman . So when they meet as complete Strangers On A Train one afternoon , Walker knows enough that Granger will at least be intrigued enough with the possibility that if the two of them , complete strangers , did commit homicide on parties that the other would be convenienced by their demise . Though Granger is repulsed by the idea , one of the beautiful things about this film , is that you can see in the performance he gives that Granger just might submit to temptation . In fact when Walker kills Laura Elliot , Granger's wife whose been two timing him and even gotten pregnant by another man , he expects that Granger will in turn murder Walker's father so that Walker can inherit his estate . Today Walker would be called a trust fund baby and a pretty malevolent one at that . Alfred Hitchcock directed Walker to his career role , ironically in his last complete film . Walker died the following year with most of My Son John finished . Hitchcock does not do too bad by Farley Granger either . Of course when Granger does balk at committing homicide on people who never did anything to him , the tension . Strangers On A Train is also characterized by great editing , first in the tennis match in which Granger has to finish the match and waylay Walker before he plants evidence convicting Granger at the crime scene . And also in that final climax with a fight on a runaway carousel between Walker and Granger . Strangers On A Train is Hitchcock at his best , it should not be missed and ought to be required viewing when film classes study editing .
395184	2483625	36377	9.0	A Visit From The Virgin Mary	Bernadette Soubirous , 1844-1879 , was a modest , shy , retiring religious girl of strong convictions in her faith who would have passed through this world unnoticed by many , but for an incident in her hometown of Lourdes in France . If you believe it was all a hallucination than this film will mean nothing to you . But there are a great many people who believe that the pious young lady was chosen for a visit from the Virgin Mary one day when she was an adolescent teen . The Virgin Mary appeared to her several times in that location which in fact was the town garbage dump . In that spot an underground spring was discovered that had healing properties . The film is based on a historical novel by Franz Werfel and Darryl F . Zanuck decided on an unknown to play young Bernadette . The girl chosen was Phyllis Isley of Oklahoma whose name was changed to Jennifer Jones and in her third film and first under her new identity , Jennifer Jones walked off with Best Actress Award of 1943 . She beat out such seasoned veterans as Ingrid Bergman , Joan Fontaine , Jean Arthur , and Greer Garson . I'm sure it helped Jones that Fontaine and Garson were the previous two year's winners , that the film was such a hit , and that David O . Selznick had totally flipped for her and used every bit of influence to get that Oscar . With all of that and a great performance as well . Jones captures both the simple beauty and piety of the young girl who may have been given insights into matters spiritual . Playing the Virgin Mary in an unbilled part was Linda Darnell , a fact I believe that did not come out until after Ms . Darnell's death in 1963 . Director Henry King gave his young unknown a lot of support by assembling a thoroughly professional cast without a bad performance in the lot . Such people as Lee J . Cobb , Vincent Price , Charles Dingle , Gladys Cooper , Roman Bohnen , and Anne Revere were just perfect in their parts . As was Charles Bickford in the role of the priest and director of the Catholic school in Lourdes . He's very skeptical at first , but becomes her firm champion . Jones and Bickford became extremely close in this film , she looked up to Bickford for the rest of his life as a father figure in Hollywood . Bickford was nominated for Best Supportin Actor , but lost to Charles Coburn and Cooper and Revere both received nominations for Best Supporting Actress , but lost to Katina Paxinou . Even with a more recent film telling the Bernadette Soubirous story that came out in 1989 with Sydney Penny , this film is still owned and shown in many Catholic churches and schools to this day . But even the most hardened of unbelievers will be blown away by Jones's performance .
395613	2483625	120514	9.0	The Importance Of Being True To Thine Own Self	Two very fine films about Oscar Wilde came out roughly at the same time during the sixties and they starred Peter Finch and Robert Morley respectively as the great literary icon . But those were in the days before Stonewall and you couldn't be all that explicit . I'm not just talking about sex scenes though there are some here . As far as films were concerned homosexuality was the love that really dare not even breathe let alone speak its name . One reason I liked this film Wilde that starred Stephen Fry in the title role is that the others began with Wilde's involvement with Lord Alfred Douglas , played here by a sexy Jude Law . Here we get a bit of background and we discover that Wilde was a latent case for years because society dictated gay was an abomination . He married and fathered two sons whom he no doubt loved . Just some of the beautiful children's stories he did write attest to that . But as the film opens with Wilde in America and touring a mining camp and giving a lecture to miners below the earth's surface , you can see the look of love in his eyes as he beholds some of those hunky miners with their shirts off . Since you know who Wilde was and his story already , you're looking yourself for signs . Wilde was a latent case until he was seduced by Robbie Ross an actor in one of his plays portrayed by Michael Sheen . I can certainly attest to the fact that if gay is your orientation and you've been with women before , when you do it the first time , you KNOW it's right for you . Later on Ioan Gruffud who apparently is his inspiration for Dorian Gray actually falls in love with Wilde . But Wilde's like a kid in a candy store and when he meets the incredibly handsome Lord Alfred Douglas . Unlike the other two Wilde pictures I mentioned this version fleshes a bit more out of ' Bosy's ' character and Jude Law may be pretty to look at , but he's a vain , shallow , selfish , and spoiled young aristocrat . Among other things Law introduces Fry to is the availability of rent boys on the street and at certain posh establishments frequented by closeted Victorians . But it all comes to an end when Bosy's dad played by Tom Wilkinson leaves a calling card accusing Wilde of being a sodomite . In the other two Wilde films , it's Oscar who just arrogantly think he can squash this thing in court with his fabled wit . Here it's Bosy who pushes Wilde into it . The other films concentrated on the trials , civil and criminal . In Wilde the emphasis is on Oscar's character and relationships . The women in Wilde's life are wife Jennifer Ehle and mother Vanessa Redgrave . In watching the two women how they interact it's like watching the families of Ennis and Jack from Brokeback Mountain and how they react to their husband's strange behavior . Also in the film very briefly is Orlando Bloom playing a rent boy . I'm surprised that the film received no Oscar nominations , no pun intended . Though it was honored in the United Kingdom . Some 40 years after Stonewall , the tragedy of Oscar Wilde not being true to his nature as he says he wished he had done from the beginning is still being played out in many areas , in many walks of life . Just look at the number of outings there have been of various political figures on the right and you know it is so . Wilde is a great film which speaks to this generation of GLBT people with current players to tell sadly an often repeated story .
395802	2483625	35093	10.0	The People's War	With the help of the extensive British colony in Hollywood , William Wyler directed at MGM the best World War II propaganda film to come out of our film industry . Mrs . Miniver won a host of Oscars including Best Picture , Best Actress for Greer Garson , Best Supporting Actress for Teresa Wright , Best Director for William Wyler , all deserved . Forget all the war pictures , this film about the trials of a British family just before and during World War II struck a poignant note with the American public . Showing how they were coping with the attacks on their civilian population made every American family identify with the Minivers . If they fail in their resolution to defend their blessed isle , we in America could be facing these same trials and depredations . Like the people in The Diary of Anne Frank , the Minivers are such ordinary folks , caught up in a thing that was not of their making . The film opens with Greer Garson coming home after a shopping trip to London deciding how to tell her husband Walter Pidgeon about a new hat . On the way home , the stationmaster Henry Travers asks Garson permission to name a rose he's been cultivating for the flower show the Miniver Rose . Pidgeon's splurged on a new car and he's trying to figure out how to tell Garson . The war comes and the Minivers and all their neighbors in their small country town have to deal with rationing and shortages and then the blitz as the ruling malignancy in Germany seeks to terrorize the British people into submission . As London took it as their Prime Minister said it would , so to do the small villages and hamlets , especially if they're located next to an RAF base . Which is where their oldest boy , Richard Ney , is now stationed after having left Oxford . He's involved too , with a radiantly beautiful Teresa Wright as the granddaughter of the local grande dame , Dame May Witty . Wright is involved in two of my favorite scenes . When she first meets the pretentious Ney and gently but firmly puts him down , who could help but fall for this girl . And her final scene with Greer Garson is what I'm convinced got them both Oscars . You have to see it , I can't say more and the hardest of hearts will be moved . Pidgeon's moment comes when he's called away because he owns a small boat , a cabin cruiser we'd call it and ordered to take it to Ramsbottom . It's the beginning of the greatest citizen mobilization of the last century , the evacuation of the British Army from the beach at Dunkirk . He and thousands like him are told what the mission is and they could expect to be under fire at that beach and crossing 40 miles of English Channel . No one flinches and a very nice animated scene at night is showing all of these small crafts filling up the river on a date with history . Garson also comes face to face with Nazism herself as she first is held captive and then turns the tables on a wounded Nazi flier who bailed out played by Helmut Dantine . Don't think all the women in America didn't think about coming face to face with evil right in their kitchens . Both Walter Pidgeon for Best Actor and Henry Travers for Best Supporting Actor got nominations themselves , but lost to James Cagney and Van Heflin respectively . In addition Dame May Witty was also up for Best Supporting Actress , but lost to her fellow cast member Teresa Wright . The valedictory for the film is delivered by Vicar Henry Wilcoxon after a bad raid in which several cast members are killed . With so much death and destruction waged on them at home , it has become the people's war , more a people's war than it was even in the United States with so many civilian casualties . We got a taste of it at Pearl Harbor and a much bigger taste on in New York , Northern Virginia , and on the Pennsylvania countryside . The words of Henry Wilcoxon should be standard reading or viewing . It's what makes Mrs . Miniver such a timeless classic as we deal with another brand of totalitarian malignancy in this century .
395119	2483625	70212	10.0	The Denizens of Harry Hope's Waterfront Dive	The Iceman Cometh is one great film to go out on for not one , but two of the best players ever . This turned out to be the last performances for both Fredric March and Robert Ryan . In the case of Ryan he knew he was terminal and his performance has real poignancy . Of course you can't beat the material that was given to them and the rest of the cast . It's been argued that The Iceman Cometh is the greatest work from the pen of America's greatest playwright Eugene O'Neill and I'm not going to argue the point . Some would give the honor of O'Neill's greatest play to Long Day's Journey Into Night . That particular play was Eugene O'Neill's remembrance of his childhood and family . The Iceman Cometh is also about a family of sorts , the community that's been established around Harry Hope's waterfront bar and SRO flophouse . It's owner Harry Hope played by Fredric March , is a former Tammany politician who's not set foot outside his establishment because he's in mourning over his late wife Bessie . The whole usual crowd of boarder / drinkers is awaiting the arrival of one of the regulars who apparently likes to go slumming there . It's Hickey , a gladhanding traveling salesman Lee Marvin who spends like a Diamond Jim Brady and is generally the life of the party . But it's a new and somber Hickey that comes to bar that day . A stranger arrives that day also , Jeff Bridges a young anarchist is on the run he says from the Pacific Coast where his mother among others has been picked up . He's looking for an older leader of the movement Larry Slade who is played by Robert Ryan . Ryan is a beaten and tired man and of all the people in the bar he's the one with the most realistic assessment . It's the last stop for this crowd before the Grim Reaper . But the somber Marvin , still full of salesman's guile gets them all to reassess themselves and their ' pipe dreams ' even for a little while . He also reveals a terrible secret about himself and Jeff Bridges has even bigger cross to bear and Bridges can't bear it . I was blown away by the performances of everyone in the cast . Marvin came in for some criticism at the time , attempting to serious a part and one that Jason Robards , Jr . was given acclaim for as his career role . But there was nothing wrong in Lee Marvin's performance that I could find . Young Jeff Bridges more than held his own with the veteran cast . My favorite among the supporting parts is Bradford Dillman who plays a lawyer who graduated from Harvard Law and for whatever reason , broke down and is now here . One member of the cast in this production was in the original Broadway cast when The Iceman Cometh premiered on Broadway in 1946 . That was Tom Pedi who played the bartender Rocky Pioggi who also doubled as a pimp for some prostitutes who hang out there . Next to Ryan , the women who we don't learn anything about really , seem to have the most realistic ideas about the patrons there . Pedi's performance in a part he grew to own is pretty special also . Bridges is the outsider , he had a cause , a revolutionary cause and O'Neill in his youth hung around with that crowd as we learned in Warren Beatty's Reds . We also learned that while O'Neill liked the people he was less than optimistic about the beliefs they had . If Bridges is a failed John Reed , O'Neill in Ryan's character of Larry Slade is looking back over the years when he drank in such places as Harry Hope's . The rest of the cast is no doubt modeled after people he knew back in the day . In his own way , O'Neill loved these people a whole lot more than he did his own family . And it's to them and for them he wrote The Iceman Cometh . And it's for us to see a small part of New York in 1912 , some folks who might have passed unnoticed by time , but for the fact that a literary genius passed among them .
396590	2483625	51658	10.0	" Oh What Miracle Has Made You The Way You Are "	The capstone of Arthur Freed's brilliant career as producer of some of the best musicals around was this film which sadly marked the end of the musical era on film . You could never produce something like Gigi directly for the screen because the talent wasn't under contract to any one studio . Nor would any studio take a chance on something original for the screen . Musicals would continue to be made , but they would be 90 % adaptations from Broadway . Though the only thing original about Gigi was the musical score . The novel by Colette had been filmed twice before , the first time a silent film from Brazil , the second a dramatic version by the French in 1949 . One of these days maybe TCM will broadcast that one and we could compare them . Just the fact that Gigi was done at all shows a cracking of Hollywood's all abiding Code . Let's face it , we're talking here about a family that raises their daughters to be courtesans . They pray for daughters and at a last resort marry . Leslie Caron as Gigi is the last survivor and she's being raised by her grandmother Hermione Gingold and her great aunt Isabel Jeans to be the best Madame DuBarry she can be . They have a family friend in Louis Jourdan and the story of Gigi is the story of how Jourdan slowly , but surely starts seeing Gigi in a different light as she grows up and kind of grows on you . Of course the French quality seal on this Hollywood , but shot on location in Paris , production is provided by that grandest boulevardier of all , Maurice Chevalier . He plays Jourdan's aging roué of an uncle who gets from Lerner and Loewe three numbers that are now permanently identified with him . Chevalier thanks the Deity for the blessings of young nubile females in Thank Heaven For Little Girls , he reminisces or attempts to reminisce about old times with Hermione Gingold in I Remember It Well , and thanks the Deity once again for not having to go through the angst of youthful passion in I'm Glad I'm Not Young Anymore . Anyone who sees Gigi and sees Chevalier perform these numbers will be an instant fan of his the way I became when I saw Gigi on screen way back in the day . But the best song of the score is Louis Jourdan's title song which is the climax of a long musical soliloquy in which Jourdan analyzes his feelings for the audience . I'm sure that one of the reasons that Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe were attracted to the Gigi project was the fact that they saw an opportunity to write another soliloquy capped off with a hit song the way they did in My Fair Lady . The similarities between what Jourdan does in Gigi and what Rex Harrison does in I've Grown Accustomed To Her Face are readily apparent . I half expect Jourdan to end the film with ' Gigi , where the devil are my slippers . ' Gigi was nominated and won in 9 separate Oscar categories which might be a record in terms of percentage of Oscars nominated for and won . Even though the following year Ben-Hur won a few more and has a record of most Oscars still standing after almost 50 years . Gigi won for Best Picture , for Best Director for Vincente Minnelli , and for the Best Song from a film for the title song . Amazingly enough none of the players got an Oscar nomination in any of the acting categories . That shouldn't have worried Minnelli though because in his Some Came Running which also was out that year , Shirley MacLaine , Arthur Kennedy , and Martha Hyer all got nominations in those categories . 1958 would have to be the high point in the career of Vincente Minnelli . One ironic thing I always found with Gigi . It's set at the turn of the last century in Paris and unlike that other MGM Parisian classic , An American in Paris , Gigi was shot entirely on location in the City of Light . The Paris of the height of the Third Republic is captured beautifully , at least our conception of it in the English speaking world . Maurice Chevalier was an adolescent growing up there at this time , but this was hardly his world then . Chevalier grew up in dire poverty in a single parent household with a mother who sacrificed everything so her son could be taught the rudiments of show business where he became an immortal . I'm sure the irony never escaped Chevalier as he was filming Gigi . What's not to like about Gigi , a wonderful musical score , a magical setting , and some fine performances in a perfectly cast company of players . Thank heaven indeed .
396010	2483625	41959	10.0	Zither Thou Goest	The Third Man refers to another witness to a crime that no one seems to know anything about . The crime of course is the hit and run murder of Harry Lime played by Orson Welles . But is Welles dead . One of the things I like about The Third Man is that it makes a nominal hero out of one of the biggest bunglers ever put on screen . Let's just say that if Holly Martins played by Joseph Cotten were bumping into furniture on top of everything else , he'd be Inspector Clouseau . Holly arrives in occupied Vienna in the late Forties at the invitation of an old college classmate Harry Lime . Literally upon arriving in Vienna , Martins learns that his friend Lime was the victim of a hit and run accident and the funeral is going on at that moment . He goes to the funeral and is smitten by Lime's girlfriend , Alida Valli . Martins is a writer of western stories and it's bad when a writer starts believing he's one of his own heroes . Maybe Jessica Fletcher is capable of it , but not Holly Martins . Martins decides to start his own investigation into Lime's death much to the consternation of the British occupying force which doing its own inquiry . Trevor Howard plays Major Callaway of the British Army in charge of the investigation . Martins turns out to be right that there is something more afoot than a simple traffic accident . But he's so terribly wrong about everything and everyone else it is frightening . I really can't say more at this point . Someone reading the plot description I've given might think The Third Man is some kind of comedy , but it is not . It is in fact one of the most finely crafted dramas ever put on the screen . The location photography in Vienna is fabulous and contributes so much to the authenticity of the story and its characters . Joseph Cotten gives one of his best performances as the bull-in-the-china-shop amateur detective . As for Orson Welles , it's a virtual tie in my opinion with Compulsion for the distinction of his finest performer as an actor without working for director Orson Welles . Harry Lime turns out to be the harbinger of a cynical age we were entering . And if nothing else grabs you about The Third Man , that theme on the zither will stay with you forever . Definitely one of the ten best known movie scores ever .
396144	2483625	50371	10.0	The Underside of John Doe	Just imagine if instead of rebelling against the new order of things that Edward Arnold planned for the country , Gary Cooper had collaborated and eventually took it over in Meet John Doe . Then you have some idea of what Elia Kazan was trying to say in A Face In The Crowd . A few years later there's no way on the planet that Andy Griffith could have been cast as Larry ' Lonesome ' Rhoads the John Doe of American nightmares . Griffith had starred on Broadway in No Time for Sergeants , cut some comedy albums , did some television appearances , but he was not a big or a small screen name . So with no image to counteract , Elia Kazan could cast him and he gives one powerful performance . But it never would have happened had he been Sheriff Andy Taylor first . Local radio station manager Patricia Neal discovers this country boy philosopher in the local jail in her Arkansas home town . Seeing he's got charisma , she puts him on the air . She figures she has another Will Rogers on her hands , but Griffith proves to be a far more malevolent person than Will Rogers ever was . Rogers was the guy who said he never met anyone he didn't like . Griffith feels there isn't anyone he ever met he couldn't clip . The frightening thing is he comes real close to proving it . Some future stars make some early appearances in A Face In The Crowd besides Griffith . Anthony Franciosa is the smooth talking ad man who rides a good thing when he sees it and that comment can be taken a lot of ways . Lee Remick is the wide-eyed cheerleader seduced by Griffith , and the good life . Walter Matthau who in his early years played a lot of hoodlums in this case is the writer who catches on early what Griffith is all about . My favorite is Kay Medford however . She has only one scene in the film with Patricia Neal . But she really scores with it as Griffith's forgotten wife who even when tipsy knows exactly how much of a piece she can get on his celebrity . A Face In The Crowd is written by Budd Schulberg who along with Elia Kazan were friendly witnesses at the House Un American Activities Committee . The ironic thing is that both these guys considered themselves as men of the left and certainly A Face In The Crowd wasn't written by any Republican . The unkindest cut of all to Elia Kazan was the fact he got booed at the Oscars when he received a deserved Lifetime Achievement Award and was eulogized eloquently by Pat Buchanan when he died . What a world . Eleven years after A Face In The Crowd came out , Kazan and Schulberg proved to be prophets of sorts when George C . Wallace ran for president . If his campaign wasn't a ' Lonesome Rhoads ' special I don't know what was . Of course Griffith falls , but how he falls is something else . I won't reveal it , but think back to that much imitated ending from another Elia Kazan masterpiece , A Streetcar Named Desire . A Face In The Crowd is a very relevant film today considering the influence some of these pious country types have in the religious right of today .
