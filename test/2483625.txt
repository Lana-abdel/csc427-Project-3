396916	2483625	34857	2.0	This Has To Be Seen To Be Believed	If you were looking to take out a contract on Hitler , would you hire the trio of Ward Bond , Paul Fix , and Warren Hymer ? I'm glad this film is preserved if only for the fact it is the best example of World War II propaganda film run totally amuck . I can't believe it was taken seriously even back in 1943 . The plot simply is that an unknown , but wealthy American businessman hires these three gangsters to kill Hitler and shorten the war . Clever guy that Hitler is , he makes frequent use of doubles to prevent assassination attempts . But the intrepid trio reaches someone in the underground who knows that Hitler has a scar on his upper lip from the aborted Beer Hall Putsch . They eventually get the real Hitler and identify him by shaving off the mustache he's grown to hide it . And the S . S . coming to rescue him , shoot him as he is trying to escape because nobody recognizes Hitler without the mustache . Two things of note . Warren Hymer made a career of playing dumb henchmen and I can't believe anyone would give him so vital a mission . And Ward Bond has the distinction of being in seven of the hundred greatest films voted on by the American Film Institute , most of any thespian . Hard to believe his career survived this . By all means get this if you want to see where Mel Brooks got the idea for The Producers .
396029	2483625	34902	2.0	It's Not Easy Dealing With An Invisible Agent	When a bunch of Nazis come calling on Jon Hall at his print shop in New York City , they seem to know all about him and the background he has tried to hide . Seems as though an ancestor of his was none other than Claude Rains who as John Griffin invented that invisibility formula that had the entire United Kingdom on edge . Hall barely escapes from the agents who include Cedric Hardwicke for the Nazis and Peter Lorre as a visiting ally from Japan . Right after Pearl Harbor like Wonder Woman , Hall decides his talents are best put to use in the Allied Cause . His condition is that he alone will be given the invisibility drug , mindful of the bad side effects it has including causing the madness that killed Claude Rains back in the day . Hall finds out some vital information , like the day the Axis is going to invade the USA and who their agents are in America . He has the help of the beautiful Ilona Massey , but he's not quite sure what side of the fence she's playing . The Nazis are stupid , even more stupid than usual in these films , but they've also got a lot of intrigues going among each other , between Cedric Hardwicke and J . Edward Bromberg to see who will be top dog under Himmler in the S . S . And Peter Lorre does not think terribly much of German efficiency and with these two around who could blame him . Maybe the Japanese ought to gain the secret of invisibility and they might be calling the tune in the Axis . It all makes for one horrific wartime propaganda flick that would be hooted off the screen by some and would offend others . Peter Lorre who was Jewish Hungarian , gets to do his Mr . Moto act with malevolence saying such things as you occidentals have this really big fetish about your white women and Hall coming back that he can't tell any of you monkeys apart . To be fare to Hardwicke , Lorre , and Bromberg , it's not easy dealing with an invisible man . Too bad they were at war with the British or they could find out how Claude Rains ultimately met his end .
395982	2483625	53142	2.0	How Do You Say Gobble Gobble Gobble In Korean ?	I'm sure that Operations Dames was a favorite at the drive-ins back in the day . There's absolutely nothing in the way of a plot that you might miss if you were otherwise preoccupied . And if you needed to get in the mood for other activities you did have some curvaceous cuties on screen to get you in the mood . Otherwise there ain't a whole lot that Operations Dames has going for it . It's set in the Korean War where a platoon of GIs together with a British tommy gets a little too far forward and has to get back to the UN lines . Bad enough already , but these guys also come across a stranded bunch of USO girls and their choreographer in the same predicament . You know what's sad about this film is that it took women generations to finally get accepted in the Army and in combat situations . These bimbos from the USO set women's liberation back light years . In fact not even the hard bitten professional soldier who is the sergeant in charge of these men can keep it in his pants . But that was probably the better to remind some what they were at the drive-in for . This no name cast is better off with me not recognizing any of them for any individual effort . Operations Dames is definitely a team flop .
394829	2483625	36241	2.0	It's a gay story folks	Jane Russell and her bosoms got most of the publicity from this film and fortunately for her she got into other better pictures and had a career . The same could not be said for Mr . Beutel . But Jane and her cleavage is superfluous to the story . This is about two middle-aged gay men , Walter Huston and Thomas Mitchell , jealous over the young hunk . It's the only way the plot makes any sense . In Jane Russell's memoirs she recounts the difference in attitude of Thomas Mitchell and Walter Huston . Mitchell was moaning and groaning about how horrible the film was , why did he ever sign for it , the film would be his ruin , etc . etc . In contrast Walter Huston's attitude was I've taken Howard Hughes's money I'll say whatever kind of drivel he wants before the camera and laugh about it later . Also , I love Tchaikovsky themes , but I really think Howard Hughes should have hired Dimitri Tiomkin whose music really added something to a lot of great westerns to do an original score . Tchaikovsky was frighteningly out of place here . The Outlaw has to be seen to be believed .
395361	2483625	71627	2.0	An Extra Vacancy In The Graveyard	John Carradine , John Ireland , and Faith Domergue who as players all saw better days in better films got together for this Grade G horror film about life imitating art in a mysterious mansion . For Carradine it was in those last two decades of his career that he appeared in anything on the theory it was better to keep working no matter what you did and get those paychecks coming in . With that magnificent sonorous voice of his , Carradine was always in great demand for horror pictures and the man did not discriminate in the least in what he appeared in . He plays the caretaker of an old Gothic mansion who movie director John Ireland has rented for his latest low budget slasher film . It's even got a graveyard , but with a missing occupant . Faith Domergue is Ireland's aging star and Carole Wells is the young ingenue . In the last twenty minutes or so most of the cast winds up dead that aren't dead already . The script is so incoherent I'm still trying to figure out the point . I won't waste any more gray matter on it .
396851	2483625	112817	3.0	Finding Meaning In The Obscure	Well maybe I'm just a Philistine but I certainly have to dissent from all the rave reviews this film has gotten . It happens I like my westerns traditional , John Ford , Howard Hawks , Delmar Daves , Burt Kennedy , those guys make westerns . Jim Jarmusch makes weird . So does Johnny Depp who I salute for having the artistic courage to play an incredible variety of roles . I love what he did in Edward Scissorhands , Nick of Time , and in the Pirates of the Caribbean series . But he came up short in playing William Blake , the guy who is not the famous English poet . This William Blake travels west spending every dime he has on a promise of a job keeping books for a metal works company owned by Robert Mitchum . When he arrives late , he's told the job is filled . He casually drifts into a relationship with a woman and wouldn't you know it , she's the gal pal of Gabriel Byrne , Mitchum's son . Byrne comes in guns blazing and catches Depp and his woman en flagrato . He shoots the woman and Depp shoots him in self defense . No matter , Mitchum's the big he bull of the area and a bounty goes on Depp's head . In the words of that immortal 20th Century philosopher Joe Louis , he can run but he can't hide . Not even with the help of a new found Indian friend in Gary Farmer . A lot of reviewers extracted meaning from obscure things in this film which wanders rather aimlessly with Depp's fugitive status . I extracted nothing , but boredom . But Dead Man might be your cup of tea , it certainly isn't mine .
396030	2483625	78740	3.0	If Not For The Courage Of The Fearless Crew , The Concorde Would Be Lost	The real star of the last of the Airport films is that big supersonic carrier the French created called The Concorde . If you bear in mind that the whole film is dedicated to showing what that needle nosed plane could do in the sky , than the whole film kind of makes sense . But if you're expecting some serious drama here , than by all means take some of the evasive action the Concorde shows here when some nasty folks try to shoot her down . Susan Blakely plays a television news reporter who also happens to be the mistress of military industrial tycoon Robert Wagner . One of Wagner's aides just happens to bring her information on some of Wagner's dirty business dealings , selling arms to folks not friendly to the USA . When the source , Macon McCalman , is killed in front of her and she's nearly done in by a hit-man whom she escapes from of course she confronts Wagner with the information . And of course he denies it . But right before Blakely boards The Concorde , McCalman's widow Kathleen Maguire hands her the necessary documents . But on the way to Moscow with a stop in Paris , Wagner and his minions try to put the big bird down . But the fearless crew of Alain Delon , David Warner , and George Kennedy is up to all their tricks . It's quite a bag full as you'll see if you want to watch the film . If you're an aviation enthusiast , you absolutely won't care about the plot . It's like the film Le Mans with Steve McQueen which has a legion of auto racing fans who have made it a cult item . Maybe Le Mans is better at that because they just didn't bother with any kind of story . Among the passengers is a pot smoking saxophonist played by Jimmie Walker , a distraught mother accompanying a new heart for her child , played by Cicely Tyson and Martha Raye a woman with a weak bladder who spends the entire trip from Washington to Paris in the loo . She's actually the best one here . Robert Wagner must have been psychic though because I'm sure on the strength of this film he got the part of Doctor Evil's number two in the Austin Powers series . I'm sure all concerned got a big pay day out of this film , but it seems to have killed the Airport saga of movies .
396036	2483625	25833	4.0	For Art's Sake	A film thought lost turned up a few months ago on TCM and I finally did get to see it . Stingaree is one curious and horribly miscast film which not even the presence of favorites of mine like Henry Stephenson and Mary Boland can save . Set in Australia in the 1870s , specifically in Victoria we don't see as much as one kangaroo in Stingaree . The presence of a lot of sheep being herded is supposed to make us think we're in Australia . When I finally saw The Sundowners which was actually filmed in Australia , I certainly saw the weakness of things like Stingaree made on the RKO back lot . But no Americans companies were location shooting that far in 1934 so I can be charitable there . But stolid Richard Dix is cast in a role that someone like Errol Flynn might have made believable . Or Douglas Fairbanks , Jr . , or Tyrone Power or Louis Hayward anyone with that swashbuckling élan . Dix just looks silly up there spouting those romantic nothings . Irene Dunne is the lonely ward of Henry Stephenson and Mary Boland who accompanies Boland because Boland fancies she can sing . And she's going to sing come hell or high water for visiting British composer Geoffrey Tearle . Dunne is told not to emote as much as low A from her range when Tearle's around . But when she mistakes the notorious bandit Stingaree for the composer , they're taken with each other . He kidnaps Dunne and later forces a gunpoint addition for the real composer and it costs him his freedom . The rest of the film is too unbelievable to describe you have to see it to confirm , but not to be entertained . Even Mary Boland who usually can save anything with her flighty portrayals doesn't go over well . It's not in her character to throw Dunne out of the house because she was upstaged . Boland is irresponsible and flighty , but never a mean person on the screen . A lot of forgettable songs are included here and the whole film is best forgotten . Good thing none of the cast is still around to be embarrassed .
396724	2483625	43169	4.0	Not The Kit Carson Of History	What I remember best about The Adventures of Kit Carson is that it was not for some reason , broadcast in New York City . I only got to see this show when visiting my grandparents in Rochester every summer . Little did I know what I was seeing had absolutely nothing to do with the real Mr . Carson who was quite the frontier figure . Christopher ' Kit ' Carson's ( 1809-1868 ) active career lasted from the Era of Good Feeling until the Civil War . He was a fur trapper and mountain man from a teen who came to fame as a guide for John C . Fremont's map-making expeditions . The trails that he and the other mountain men kept as a secret were mapped by Fremont with Carson showing the way . He fought in the Mexican War and the Civil War attaining the rank of general . The Carson I saw as played by Bill Williams with a brace of pistols was a wandering fellow who was a general righter of wrongs in an era following when the real Carson died . At least the west looked pretty much like the post Civil War frontier we saw in a gazillion westerns . Williams was pretty much the standard cowboy hero . Carson had a Mexican sidekick named El Toro played by Don Diamond who was better known much later as Corporal Reyes in Walt Disney's Zorro series and as Crazy Cat of the Hekawis on F Troop . He played a mean guitar , had an amorous nature , and Carson kept him around for more than laughs the way the Cisco Kid did Pancho . Kit Carson was a most remarkable man and he's been portrayed many times on the big and small screen . Which is probably why this series hasn't had a market for syndication for years . Still seeing it again would be nostalgic and fun .
396644	2483625	25948	4.0	Should Have Been Viva Madero	I'm still not clear on how MGM got away with this film . Pancho Villa had only been dead for 10 years and his famous raid on Columbus , New Mexico almost 20 years . Surely not enough time for people to have forgotten Villa or what he did . But the most famous thing he did , raid into the USA and provide a pretext for intervention into Mexican affairs , is completely forgotten by this film . The Villa we see here is a lovable lug of a guy , a typical Wallace Beery part who gets his social conscience awakened by Francisco Madero and gives up banditry to become a revolutionary . If you're a big fan of Wallace Beery and liked him in such films as Min and Bill and Treasure Island than Viva Villa is simply an extension of the characters he played there . Actually I think the most interesting character in the film is that of Francisco Madero . Henry B . Walthall's performance is the best and I wish Walthall had starred in a film where he was the central character . Madero was as you see in the film a man of high ideals , betrayed and assassinated by his supporters . But it was hardly Pancho Villa who took vengeance on his betrayers . After long time Mexican dictator Porfirio Diaz was overthrown in 1911 and then Madero assassinated in 1912 , Mexico fell apart much like the former Yugoslavia did almost 20 years ago . Civil war raged there for a generation . Eventually it united under the PRI party which elected all of its presidents until Vicente Fox . I've never really liked this film , it stray so far from the facts it's laughable . The players go through their familiar roles and it's a good cast that Howard Hawks later Jack Conway put through their paces . Of course the most famous story coming out of this film is about Lee Tracy getting blotto and going out on a balcony and raining on some Mexican soldiers . Got him fired from the film and Stu Erwin got the break and Tracy's part as the newspaper reporter who popularizes Villa . If in fact you consider it a break Erwin got to be in Viva Villa .
394346	2483625	79770	4.0	Bleak , Bleak , Bleak	Quintet marks the only venture of both Paul Newman and director Robert Altman into the realm of science fiction . It was said of Newman that he could not do comedy , but he tried until he finally scored a real success in that genre with Slap Shot . But the failure of this film left him gun shy and he never tried it again . This is one of the biggest downer films I've ever seen . It's a futuristic ice age , brought on by who knows what , but presumably it's a nuclear winter . Even during the ice age of thousands of years ago , the equatorial parts of the earth still sustained animal and human life , but apparently not here . Seals have survived and Paul Newman is a seal hunter on the outside . But hunters do need a little R & R and Newman goes to a futuristic city where things are so boring the natives have some kind of game played with six people and it's a kind of Russian roulette . To win you have to kill five other participants in your game . It's a sad turn to see what man has come down to . Which is one of the reasons I just could not get into this story . The atmosphere is bleak , the story is bleak , the people are bleak , it's all so bleak . No wonder this thing came up short at the box office . It's a film that just about everyone thinks is never going to be on the top ten list of Paul Newman films , including me . This is man's future , what a bummer .
392963	2483625	52662	5.0	Aged Broadway Vehicle Reclaimed for Gable .	But Not For Me is one of the weakest of Clark Gable's later films . It is based on a 1935 Broadway play , Accent on Youth by Samson Raphaelson , the same guy who wrote The Jazz Singer . The plot revolves around a fifty something Broadway producer who gets his batteries recharged when his secretary , Carroll Baker , confesses her love for him . That would do something for just about anyone's mojo and pretty soon they're involved . Her confession also sparks an idea in Gable for a reworking of a play that he and writer Lee J . Cobb are trying to get produced . Baker goes from secretary to star . Of course her co-star in the play , Barry Coe , is not happy with Baker and Gable as an item as he would like to be the item with Baker . Possibly in 1935 the May / December romance bit was naughty , but in 1959 it was pretty old hat by then . Fellow stars Tyrone Power and Bing Crosby both married women considerably younger than themselves during that decade . Gable's fifth and last wife was about 17 years younger than him . And today with the latest tabloid fodder being Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes , But Not For Me is really tame stuff . The best performance in the film is from Lilli Palmer as Gable's ex-wife who would like to win him back . Oddly enough she was living some of that same drama in real life . A little earlier in the decade Palmer split from her husband Rex Harrison who married Kay Kendall . According to her memoirs , Palmer agreed to the divorce because Harrison told her Kendall was dying and she did pass away of leukemia within a couple of years of their marriage . Palmer said Harrison would remarry her after Kendall died , but Harrison doublecrossed her . If you're interested in seeing how things worked out for Lilli Palmer than by all means see this film . Otherwise it really is for hardcore Clark Gable fans .
393637	2483625	61015	5.0	Matrimony On Their Minds	Spinout is somewhere in the middle of the pack of the Elvis Presley cinema output . It's an amiable comedy with the King about a singer with a group who is a celebrity racer . Along the lines of Paul Newman before and Tom Cruise afterwards . I don't include Steve McQueen because that man was serious about the sport and had he entered it earlier might have had that as a career . Anyway Elvis is the target of three women with matrimony on their minds . Rich girl Shelley Fabares , Jacqueline Susann like author Diane McBain , and the drummer in the King's own group , Deborah Walley who is a gourmet cook on the side . As usual Colonel Tom Parker got quality help for his boy behind and in front of the camera . Norman Taurog ended his career directing a series of Presley pictures and this is one of them . Such movie veterans as Frederic Worlock and Cecil Kellaway have small roles and this is the farewell big screen appearance of Una Merkel . Also in the cast is Carl Betz once again playing Shelley Fabares father as he did on the Donna Reed Show . Will Hutchins , television's Sugarfoot is also around as a policeman who appreciates good cooking and Jack Mullaney and Jimmy Hawkins are the other members of Elvis's group . Note that they play electric guitars or simulate playing them while Elvis sticks with a regular model . Of course Spinout ends with the Big Race and I don't think I have to tell you who wins , but the race itself is of the fun . No big songs came out of the score for Elvis , but he acquits himself in the vocal and comedy department . Spinout should please his fans .
393650	2483625	43673	5.0	Drought On The Range	In Old Amarillo finds Roy Rogers working for cattle baron Pierre Watkin as a range detective investigating a drought that is plaguing all the ranches in the Amarillo area . The foreman of the Watkin ranch , Roy Barcroft , has got a few schemes of his own to take advantage of the drought and clean up in a bad cattle market . Why the film is called In Old Amarillo is beyond me because it is set in the modern day west . One of the schemes used in fact is an airplane trying to seed the clouds so they will rain . Another problem Roy has is Watkin's spoiled son Kenneth Howell who is more at home in a nightclub than home on the range . Watkin's sends Howell to Roy to straighten out , but he falls under Barcroft's influence instead . In the midst of all this Roy takes some time to woo Penny Edwards , granddaughter of another ranch owner , Elizabeth Risdon . Risdon usually played old battle axes in her films , she's probably best known at least in western films as Audrey Long's aunt who Gabby Hayes spanks in John Wayne's Tall in the Saddle . Here she's a nice old pioneer granny . In his later films Roy's Christianity was creeping more and more into his work . When all else fails he calls a cowboy prayer meeting in which he sings the song Wasteland hoping the Good Lord will prevent such a thing happening in Texas and give up with some rain . Of course you know what's going to happen , but you might want to check out the mysterious ways God moves In Old Amarillo .
396729	2483625	35746	5.0	Commandos Invade Norway	In Commandos Strike At Dawn , Paul Muni is a Norwegian fisherman who does not like what the Nazis have brought in occupying his country . After a murder he resolves to leave Norway and do something about it . As Eric Toreson , Muni has his most stoic role with the exception of Benito Juarez . But his facial expressions and the controlled anger in his voice tell the story than a lot theatrics . It's unfortunate that a better story could not be utilized for a man of his talents . I'm still struggling over the idea that before the war an admiral of the Royal Navy , Cedric Hardwicke together with his daughter Anna Lee , are visiting Muni's village . It certainly doesn't look like a vacation spot or that she would take up with Muni who was certainly beneath her in the European class system . A year later Warner Brothers produced The Edge of Darkness also about the Norwegian resistance which starred Errol Flynn . Now Flynn was in no way in Muni's class as an actor , but as an action hero he certainly filled the bill . Lillian Gish is in this film as the wife of Ray Collins who is picked up for his anti-Nazi views and tortured . For someone of her talents , she's given little to do . Western fans will recognize B picture cowboy actor Rod Cameron in the role of the Lutheran parson of the village . George MacReady is the village school teacher in one of the few sympathetic roles he ever had on screen . Doing double duty is Alexander Knox as the Nazi captain among the occupiers of the village . You can also easily recognize Knox's voice as the unseen parson blessing the British commandos as they embark on a raid near Muni's village . It's typical World War II propaganda and if it weren't for the quality of the cast Commandos Strike At Dawn would barely be a blip on the nostalgia radar .
395232	2483625	43469	5.0	Those Seminole Wars	United States Pictures which released Distant Drums through Warner Brothers was I think Gary Cooper's own production company . Looking at The Films of Gary Cooper book , I noticed about three others with same credits in the Fifties of which Distant Drums was the first . The film was shot on actual location in the Everglades , I think Gary Cooper must have gotten some taste of what Bogey and Hepburn were enduring doing The African Queen . Too bad the story didn't rate the same as The African Queen . Cooper is an American Army captain on duty with the army of General Zachary Taylor , played by Robert Barrat , who lives on his own island and doesn't dress in any army uniform . Zach Taylor had a reputation for informality , but that was carrying it a bit too far . The only other guy who had his own private island during war was Lt . Commander Quentin McHale and his PT Boat crew . Anyway Barrat gives Cooper a mission and a Navy lieutenant played by Richard Webb to carry it out . To attack an old Spanish fort and go by boat across Lake Okechoobee . An early type of amphibious warfare . The attack goes off as planned and some civilian prisoners are rescued from the renegades using the fort . But the Seminoles are in hot pursuit of Cooper and the whole bunch through most of the film . I can't believe by the way that a director like Raoul Walsh had the army and the Seminoles fighting with repeating rifles and six shooter revolving pistols . Stuff wasn't invented yet . For the early years of the republic , Florida under Spanish rule and loose rule at that , was a thorn in our side . Pirates like the ones you see here used it as a haven for raiding purposes . But it was also a refuge for runaway slaves . Our southern states wanted Florida acquired to put an end to that . The indigenous tribes to Florida , the Seminoles did offer refuge for runaway slaves . So a war there was inevitable , especially when southern presidents like Andrew Jackson were in the White House . Maybe one day someone will do a proper film on the early history of Florida , but this ain't it .
393790	2483625	25843	5.0	Butterworth Flunks The Team	Philosophy Professor Charles Butterworth just can't get into the school spirit . He's gone and flunked the entire rowing team and their world tour is canceled . What to do , but bring Butterworth along on the Student Tour and tutor them and give them makeups before the big match at Oxford . And who do they get to room with Butterworth , none other but rowing trainer Jimmy Durante . Probably with a better script the team of Butterworth and Durante might have done better , but this was a slapdash affair that MGM put together . The love interest is a Cinderella story involving team captain Phil Regan and Butterworth's daughter Maxine Doyle . What a difference taking off your glasses can make as Clark Kent would be the first to tell . MGM house songwriters Nacio Herb Brown and Arthur Freed contributed a most unmemorable score . Jimmy Durante wisely had his own , I Say It With Music interpolated for his number . The main song in the film was The Carlo , a big singing and dancing number that Nelson Eddy sang . Eddy was being showcased as a possible new leading man and would be the following year in Naughty Marietta with Jeanette MacDonald . Student Tour is all right and entertaining , but could have stood a lot of improvement .
396743	2483625	43390	5.0	Oh Please , Wait A Minute Mr . Postman	For the life of me I can't understand why Loretta Young fought so hard to get this part . It hardly shows her to her best advantage on screen . She's terribly miscast in a role that Barbara Stanwyck could have phoned in or Joan Crawford have telegraphed . She's Mrs . Suburban Housewife to all appearances , married to Barry Sullivan who's now bedridden with a touch of illness . Physical and mental . Sullivan's conceived of a plot that Loretta's hatching with the doctor , Bruce Cowling to kill him . It's all in his mind , but Sullivan's written a letter to the District Attorney and Loretta gave it to the postman . Loretta spends the rest of the film trying to get that letter back , but in the end fate and good old Dr . Cowling seem to solve her problems in the end . I say seem to because given her behavior during most of the 73 minutes of the film , there ain't no way she ain't raised a few eyebrows . In other words she's got plenty Cause For Alarm . My guess is that since the character of the wife is on screen every moment of the film and narrates the melodrama Loretta might have seen it as a good woman's picture where the female dominates . She probably also wanted to expand her range from films like The Farmer's Daughter and Come to the Stable so she decided to poach on Stanwyck / Crawford territory . Her best scenes are with Irving Bacon the complaining postman and with Postal Superintendent Art Baker trying to retrieve that letter . Also she has some nice scenes with young Brad Morrow the kid in the Hopalong Cassidy suit which was just becoming the rage back then . The scenes with Morrow are to establish the niceness of her character , not the sort who plans on killing husbands . Cause For Alarm just was not material in Loretta Young's league .
396686	2483625	35659	5.0	Ankara , City of a Thousand Plots	It's now part of Hollywood lore how George Raft immeasurably aided the career of Humphrey Bogart by turning down High Sierra , The Maltese Falcon and Casablanca . After the last one I guess Raft thought he'd go for a Casablanca type story and the film of Eric Ambler's Background to Danger seemed like a good bet . If working with Sidney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre worked for Bogey . . . . . . . . . . . Background to Danger only confirmed Raft's wisdom about trying to stick to what he could handle . Had he been in Casablanca , the film today would be a routine action adventure picture not the cinema classic it is . According to a biography of Raft , Peter Lorre was stealing scenes all over the place and blew cigarette smoke in Raft's face causing him to lose concentration . After repeated requests to stop doing it , Raft clocked Lorre on the chin and that settled the problems they had . On the set that is , on screen Raft registers no presence at all with his fabled co-stars . Raft is an American agent , Greenstreet a Nazi , and Brenda Marshall and Lorre are a brother and sister team of Soviet agents all looking for a forged document about false Soviet invasion plans for Turkey . The action starts in Turkey's capital of Ankara and ends up in the city of Istanbul . Background to Danger had to be the first American made film based in Ankara . Before the overthrow of the Ottoman Empire , Ankara barely passed for an oasis . Mustapha Kemal selected it for his capital because of its central location on the Anatolian peninsula . The city grew exponentially between the wars and Turkish neutrality in World War II kept up the growth rate though the Ankara we see here is depicted on the back lot of Warner Brothers studio . All the neutral capitals in the World War II years were good subjects for espionage films . Everyone of them could have been described like Ankara as a city of a thousand plots . Too bad a better film couldn't have been done here .
394198	2483625	25954	5.0	Fighting Caravans gets the B treatment	In 1931 Paramount filmed Zane Grey's Fighting Caravans and turned it into an A picture western with Gary Cooper . It was the mentality of the studio bosses back then , why waste good stock footage . So a shorter version of this same story was done three years later with Randolph Scott playing the leading role of Clint Belmet . Having both versions , I could compare them side by side . Same footage involving the wagon train going west and of the Indian attack climax . Just juxtapose close-ups of the current cast and you got yourself another movie on the cheap . Since this version is only 56 minutes it was part of Paramount's B unit and played second on double bills . Like in the first Fighting Caravans , Wagon Wheels has one young scout and two old ones leading the wagon train west . Gail Patrick gets one of her first and only leads . Usually Patrick is cast as the other woman . Maybe her best know role was as Carole Lombard's sister in My Man Godfrey . Gary Cooper was an A list star , but Randolph Scott was on the way up and would get to not quite the top of the heap soon . He acquits himself well here . Great stuff for the Saturday matinée crowd .
396129	2483625	71566	5.0	Canned And Banned	With a plot partially lifted from The Towering Inferno , Gold is a man made disaster of a film in every sense of the word . Ray Milland is the hard as nails South African gold mine magnate , Harry Hirschfeld . He's done something to get the gold traders mad at him because they're planning to do him dirt . John Gielgud is head a gold buying syndicate and he's planning with the connivance of Bradford Dillman who is Milland's grandson-in-law , to blow a hole in the Sonderditch mine that Milland owns , letting in the ocean and flooding the mine . The price of gold will go up because of the sudden shortage . The fact that a thousand men might be killed is of little importance to Gielgud and company . Nor is it to Dillman who's found out that his wife Susannah York has been cheating on him with Roger Moore the new mine general manager . The film is a sanctioned glimpse at the former Union of South Africa as the old apartheid government would like to show you . The mining sequences are quite well done and I wish that they had stuck to a simple disaster film instead throwing in the romance . In fact Roger Moore , intrepid hero that he is , looks ridiculous because when the ocean flood starts , he's out having a romp with Susannah York . Instead of applauding him for his eventual heroism , Milland should have had him canned and banned from the industry . Unless you like Roger Moore , I'd give iron pyrites a pass .
392913	2483625	44919	5.0	Montana Bull	Montana Belle which probably at best started out to be an average B western product from RKO got to Howard Hughes's attention because it starred his protégé Jane Russell . This make believe account of the famous female outlaw Belle Starr got cut and recut and edited down to a mess of a story if you're looking for coherency . The film was made in 1948 and released in 1952 and that's always bad news . Like Jane's first feature , The Outlaw , certain western legends who never in real life met up with each other , have dealings in the Hollywood west . In The Outlaw , it's the Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid story rewritten to have Doc Holiday's participation . In Montana Belle , Jane as Belle Starr is rescued by Bob Dalton played by Scott Brady . But later when she mistakes a doublecross she forms her own gang with Forrest Tucker and Jack Lambert as a most stereotypical Indian . In the meantime another guy with his hormones in a tizzy over Jane's titanic weaponry is George Brent , gentleman gambler and owner of the largest liquor & gaming establishment in Guthrie , Oklahoma . He's going to reform Jane and separate her from her disreputable outlaw companions . Nice work if you can get it . You can't say too much about the story , Howard Hughes muddled this one , the same as he muddled , The Outlaw , Jet Pilot , and My Forbidden Past . One thing he didn't do for which we can thank the Deity is that he didn't cut Jane's number , The Gilded Lily from the film . It's definitely the best thing about Montana Belle . But over at Republic they were shooting westerns with all their B stars that had more coherent plots than you see here .
393320	2483625	78918	5.0	Made With The Best Of Intentions	Bushido Blade is a film that kind of got lost with all the hoopla surrounding the Shogun TV mini-series . Commodore Perry's opening of Japan deserved a better treatment than what it got here . No reflection on the cast , they certainly try hard enough . And the making of the film is a service of sorts because America is woefully ignorant about Japan other than knowing that they were our opponents in World War II . Making his farewell appearance on the screen is Richard Boone as the crusty Commodore Matthew Calbraith Perry . From what little I know of Perry , Boone seems to have captured him very well . Perry was the younger brother of Oliver Hazard Perry who was the commander of the Great Lakes Navy that beat the British and kept them from invading us through Canada . Younger brother Cal ( family and friends used Perry's middle name when addressing him ) served in the United States Navy for over 30 years and the opening of Japan was the capstone of a great career . Bushido Blade is a fictional sideline to the true events surrounding the treaty Perry signed with the Shogun . There was a faction in Japan who wanted to keep the country's isolationist policy going and were quite willing to do anything in that endeavor . They steal a ceremonial samurai sword that is to be presented to President Franklin Pierce by Perry . As this is a question of honor , the Japanese balk at signing the treaty at the last minute . The Japanese insist on themselves recovering the sword , but Perry unofficially sends Marine Captain Frank Converse , Boatswain Mike Starr , and young Naval Midshipman Timothy Patrick Murphy on his own mission . The three get split up during an attack . The bulk of the film is the separate experiences of all three . Frank Converse is a fine actor , but I couldn't quite believe him as an instant Samurai . When he has to battle the champion Samurai he gets a bit of help to say the least . Skill with a Samurai sword is not something one learns on the job or on the fly and by rights he should never have survived . Young Timothy Patrick Murphy cuts a fine romantic figure as his odyssey includes a small romantic interlude with a young Japanese girl who is intrigued by this occidental who speaks her language . Murphy reminded me just a bit of Tyrone Power in Son of Fury . It was sad indeed that he died so young of AIDS , he had a great career ahead of him . Such fine Japanese players as Toshiro Mifune , Tetsuro Tamba , and Mako fill their roles well . I very much enjoyed James Earl Jones who played a whaling harpooner who was a prisoner . Before the treaty was signed with Japan , sailors from the west who had the misfortune to be shipwrecked in Japan could expect never to see home again . The Bushido Blade is an average film about a key incident in both American and Japanese history . It could have used a lot more of everything , direction , production values , editing . But the players did their best with it . A good triple feature one day might be watching The Barbarian and the Geisha even with a woefully miscast John Wayne , The Bushido Blade , and the best film on 19th century Japan after the opening , The Last Samurai with Tom Cruise . It's a chance to see the Japanese as more than our enemies in World War II or having their city's destroyed by some prehistoric beast .
393009	2483625	25472	5.0	Who's Looking To Blow Up The Panama Canal ?	One of the very few Spencer Tracy Fox films that is available is Marie Galante . In it Spence plays an American agent working out of the Canal Zone in Panama and trying to stop a plot from blowing the canal up and incidentally trapping the American fleet as it is steaming through . Complicating matters is Ketti Gallian playing the title role of the film . She's a French girl who gets picked up by a drunken sea captain and left ashore in Yucatan . She works her way down to the Panama Canal hoping to get a boat back to France , but she kind of blunders into the whole scheme of some master criminal to destroy the canal . Of course her undocumented presence without passport in the Canal Zone arouses everyone's suspicions . Only Tracy has faith in her . Marie Galante boasts the presence of Helen Morgan playing a variation on her Julie role from Show Boat . She's a drunken chanteuse and of course this too sadly reflected on her real life . She gets a couple of songs to do in her inimitable torch style , but nothing on the order of the hits Jerome Kern wrote for her . The usual suspects in films like this are there , but this is not World War II yet and alliances have not been formed . Also the reason for blowing up the canal reflects a bit more on today's politics than in those of that era interestingly enough . Marie Galante was an example of the kind of two fisted action parts that Spencer Tracy was doing over there with barely a stretch on his considerable talent . Still fans of Tracy will appreciate the film .
396855	2483625	36692	5.0	Deanna's lovely voice	Can't Help Singing featuring Deanna Durbin singing those wonderful Jerome Kern-E . Y . Harburg songs either solo or with Robert Paige is nice musical entertainment . So entertaining it can even be forgiven some very illogical plot premises . Deanna's the daughter of a United States Senator who's run away from home to catch up to her beau , cavalry lieutenant David Bruce . On the wagon train west to California she hooks up with gambler Robert Paige and a couple of Russian con artists , Akim Tamiroff and Leonid Kinsky . Maybe I am being picky , but I cannot understand for the life of me why Deanna's father Ray Collins had such a problem with David Bruce . He sees him as an opportunist , but at the time of the California gold rush when this film is set , there was in fact a very famous marriage by an army lieutenant to a prominent Senator's daughter . That would be John C . Fremont wedding Jessie Benton , daughter of Senator Thomas Hart Benton . Of course an ambitious army lieutenant is no match for his sugarplum , but hooking up with a gambler is all right . Doesn't make any sense no matter how many times I see Can't Help Singing . Still when Jerome Kern writes the music , a whole multitude of sins are forgiven . Universal spent quite a bit of money on this film , probably more than they'd spend on three Abbott and Costello films and those two were Universal's bread and butter at this time . In fact Kinsky and Tamiroff make a very funny pair . Maybe they should have teamed more often . Can't Help Singing is good musical entertainment , just learn to live with the ridiculous plot .

All they have to do is do it under the aliases provided by James Stewart and Don Tomkins who are being forced to go to Paris and study art by their rich mater and pater . If you can believe that , you'll believe anything . Just as I never thought I would see a film where Shemp Howard was billed over Jimmy Stewart . Yet this Vitagraph short subject marked the film debut of a screen legend . Gribbon and Shemp are living it up in Gay Paree with the money sent by the parents of the guys they're impersonating after each pre-written letter that they send . Still they manage to screw up the arrangement . Highlight of the short subject for me is Shemp Howard attempting to do the apache dance and getting the roles reversed . Art Trouble is a mildly amusing short that would be totally forgotten today if a screen icon weren't in it .
394191	2483625	61439	6.0	" . . . . . . . . a fleeting wisp of glory , called Camelot . "	I wish I had seen the original Broadway production of Camelot . As a lad the Broadway cast album was a treasured staple in our house , played over and over again by my parents . Can you imagine a cast led by Richard Burton , Julie Andrews and introducing Robert Goulet as Lancelot ? So why couldn't Warner Brothers sign the original cast from Broadway for the movie ? Robert Goulet had in fact come to Hollywood and didn't set the world on fire , but the other two were already big box office names by 1967 . Julie Andrews had won an Oscar for Mary Poppins and just did the Sound of Music . And Richard Burton was one half of the most noted show business couple of the Sixties with his wife Elizabeth Taylor . Jack Warner , usually a smart guy , said that he didn't think that anyone would believe that two guys like Arthur and Lancelot would put a kingdom at risk for the love of Mary Poppins . So Julie wasn't even asked and Vanessa Redgrave got the call . She's certainly sexy enough , but she opted for the Rex Harrison talk / sing in doing Guinevere . If you have the video or DVD of Camelot play that and then listen to Julie Andrews sing from the original cast album . My favorite song from the score is I Loved You Once In Silence and Julie Andrews is at her best singing that song . Vanessa doesn't come close . Ditto for Richard Burton and Richard Harris . Though in the case of Harris I think he was toning it down a mite for a clearly handicapped co-star in the vocal department . Harris later in his life toured extensively in various productions of Camelot as Arthur , virtually taking over the role originated by his close friend Burton . The biggest hit from the Camelot score was If Ever I Would Leave You , sung by Robert Goulet . In 1961 you couldn't get away from that song being played on the radio right in the midst of all the rock and roll . Goulet also toured in various stock companies of Camelot and like both Burton and Harris revived it on Broadway . I don't think anyone ever asked Franco Nero to tour . But Redgrave and Nero certainly created their own screen magic , they got involved with each other on the set . But folks this is a musical and musically they don't measure up . David Hemmings takes over the role of Mordred from Roddy McDowall who did it on stage . His Mordred is a clever schemer , but a coward as well . For myself the best Mordred ever portrayed on screen was in Knights of the Round Table by Stanley Baker . Baker's interpretation of Mordred is light years from Hemmings , he's a schemer , but he's definitely no coward . I love the score of Camelot and when it was filmed I only wish the singing was half as good as the Broadway show .
395103	2483625	26519	6.0	Cooking For Employment and Husband Catching	If You Could Only Cook had been made over at MGM , Jean Arthur would have had her pick of leading men like Robert Montgomery , William Powell , Robert Young , or Franchot Tone all of who might have been a bit more believable as the auto tycoon who gets tired of his stuffy board of directors and walks out on them . As it was Columbia Harry Cohn got her Herbert Marshall is far better cast in more mature parts like in The Little Foxes or the head of MI5 in The List of Adrian Messenger . He really hasn't the touch for light fare like If You Could Only Cook . That's what happens to Marshall though , he walks out on his board of directors and a week before his wedding to Frieda Inescourt who's from a family with an old name , but no dough . On the park bench he runs into Jean Arthur who is one of the great mass of unemployed . They get to talking about food and Arthur sees in the want ads one for a married couple to be cook and butler on an estate . On a whim as these things are in screwball comedies , Marshall and her agree to pose as husband and wife . What they don't know is that who's hiring them is gangster Leo Carrillo who's particular about his food . Not unusual because if you remember Goodfellas the wise guys in stir were very particular about their food and were rich enough to buy what they want in the joint . Carrillo's number two , Lionel Stander , thinks these two just don't sound right . The rest of the film is the normal antics of mistaken identities and mistaken motives and finding out who really loves who after all . It's not a bad film , but not particularly a memorable one . But If You Could Only Cook attained a status way beyond its own importance in film history by becoming the object of a fraud perpetrated on the foreign markets by Harry Cohn . Seems as though when the film reached Europe , Cohn advertised it in the foreign markets as being a Frank Capra Production . When Capra found out about it , he went ballistic and ultimately his connection with Columbia was severed . The story is described in great detail in Capra's memoirs and the whole saga is a great example of the power those studios had back when they were at their height . In fact that whole story might make a great movie .
393996	2483625	217521	6.0	Idolized Outlaw Father	The Great Stagecoach Robbery was one of the Red Ryder series from Republic Pictures . Though Herbert J . Yates's main star at this time was singing cowboy Roy Rogers not all of his stars sung . Bill Elliott was one of several actors to play the role comic book cowboy hero Red Ryder on the screen . He might be the best known of the screen Red Ryders although his nickname of Wild Bill Elliott came from playing Wild Bill Hickok in a few films . This film was something of a shock to me as it involved the murder of a child and a deliberate one on one act of homicide . The Ryder tries to aid an outlaw played by Francis McDonald to go straight which is his intention . But other people have different ideas for McDonald . First his two kids John James and Sylvia Arslan who idolize their outlaw father . Two of McDonald's former henchmen want to take up business as usual . But the fact that McDonald is coming back to Painted Valley to return $150 . 000 . 00 in stolen money which he hid before being arrested doesn't sit well with them at all . These two try to use the kids for their nefarious purposes . The murder of Sylvia Arslan in a film that was designed for the Saturday matinée crowd was something I never figured to see in a Republic cowboy movie . It's all the more gruesome because the perpetrator is an authority figure . How Herbert J . Yates let this one out let alone the censors miss it is a mystery . Considering what has transpired the Heigh-Ho Silver ending with Red Ryder and Little Beaver riding off into the sunset is a bit much . Still The Great Stagecoach Robbery is not a bad B western and you can see why the strong and personable Wild Bill Elliott was such a popular cowboy star back in the day .
396252	2483625	35689	6.0	Knute Rockne Joins the Army Air Corps	Pat O'Brien takes his Knute Rockne character and joins the Army Air Corps in Bombardier and he and Randolph Scott have a disagreement as far as air tactics go . Scott wants to do things as they do in the RAF where he's been an observer . Fly in low and drop bombs and avoid being shot at . O'Brien is more interested in technology . Develop and learn how to use an accurate bombsight so you can be up around 20 , 000 feet and only have to worry about enemy planes which presumably your fighter escort has to deal with . But since these guys are friends it's a good natured fight as both are in the business of training bombardiers . Among the familiar faces they train are Eddie Albert and Robert Ryan before both went in the service themselves . Bombardier is so very dated now , but still entertaining . The advances in technology are light years beyond what O'Brien and Scott are dealing with . Film buffs who are air historians might like it though .
392743	2483625	52877	6.0	" I catch them , I don't hang them . "	The Hangman finds Robert Taylor as a relentless U . S . Marshal who pursues criminals with the zeal of Lieutenant Gerard when he was hunting for Richard Kimble in The Fugitive . Barry Morse's words from that show could equally have served as Taylor's bywords , " I don't philosophize , I hunt . " Who he's hunting is the last man of a four man gang accused of a holdup where a death occurred . Two guys are already dead and one is sentenced to hang . But nobody knows who number four is or what he looks like . Taylor in his quest goes to an army post where he finds recent widow Tina Louise and he's authorized by Wells Fargo to offer a reward of $500 . 00 if she'll come to a town where he's reputed to be and point him out . When he arrives in town , the object of his quest who turns out to be Jack Lord is about the most popular fellow there . Why he didn't run for mayor or even for Fess Parker's job as sheriff is beyond me . But Taylor gets no help from anybody . The title derives from the nickname Taylor has acquired for his dogged dedication to duty . The Hangman is a western with very little action surprisingly , but it has a good character study by the mature Robert Taylor . It's a well rounded portrait of a man who'd like to leave the job he's in , but has grown used to it and it's the only living he's known for years . The Hangman was the first film Robert Taylor did outside MGM since Magnificent Obsession in the Thirties . He has a record , definitely unlikely to be broken now of the longest running studio contract in film history . The Hangman is a good , not great western besides those already mentioned I did enjoy Mabel Albertson's performance as a dotty old biddy who's eying Robert Taylor like a slab of romantic beef . Well he was one of the biggest screen heartthrobs ever . Personally , I think Taylor should have concentrated on westerns in his later years the same way Joel McCrea and Randolph Scott did . He liked making them and though he's not primarily known as a western star , films like Devil's Doorway , Saddle the Wind , The Last Hunt and The Law and Jake Wade hold up very well today . The Hangman's not as good as these I've mentioned , but it still has a fine performance from Robert Taylor and the rest of the cast .
394262	2483625	69834	6.0	How would Rooster Cogburn have handled it ?	As portrayed by John Wayne , United States Marshal J . D . Cahill is a man obsessed with his work as a lawman . I guess you needed super dedication in doing that job right . Trouble is , he's neglected his two sons , Gary Grimes and Clay O'Brien who've fallen in with bad company . In fact that bad company has thought of a pretty good scheme in how to rob the town bank with the help from the Cahill boys . One unforeseen consequence of the scheme is the sheriff and deputy from the town are both killed . Wayne catches up with some nefarious characters who fit a general description and have a chunk of cash on them . They're not the right guys and he suspects as much . The rest of the story concerns what happens as Grimes and O'Brien are conscience stricken and how that brings about a general righting of wrongs . My problem with the story is that marshal's kids or not , they've committed a major league felony . In another film Grimes would have hung for it . Two law enforcement officials were killed in the performance of their duty . You do recall in Hang ' Em High those two kids who did not help Bruce Dern overpower Clint Eastwood still hung in the end . Or in True Grit , John Wayne shoots without hesitation some young criminals there . But this is a John Wayne film involving his family so the Duke is trapped by certain parameters that his fans expect . It makes for some weakly resolved issues in the plot . But if you're a fan of the Duke , Cahill U . S . Marshal will fill your bill .
393338	2483625	44828	6.0	Sahara redux	A good remake of Sahara with Broderick Crawford leading the cast of competent if not name performers . Crawford was still in the glow of his two star quality performances in All The King's Men and Born Yesterday . Broderick Crawford is a cavalry sergeant leading a patrol in the Arizona desert and they're attacked . As in Sahara , the patrol settles in for a siege at a waterhole , where the numerically superior Indians surround them , but are being dehydrated for lack of water . It's a test of wills and if you saw Sahara , you know how it will come out . Young Johnny Stewart as the Comanche boy Little Knife is in the second of the two feature films he did for Columbia . He had a good screen presence and God only knows why he didn't become a major star . Good B western with a quality cast .
394489	2483625	44673	6.0	The Medieval Gauntlet	The famous Hitchcockian McGuffin that everyone is looking for is a medieval jewel encrusted knight's gauntlet said to have belonged to a warrior saint who defeated the Moors in battle back in the day . The fact that the Moors never got to the French Riviera in and around Monte Carlo is of minor importance . It's an object of veneration and worship to the villagers in that small town that saw battle in the southern invasion of France by Alexander Patch's American army in August of 1944 . Paratrooper Glenn Ford landing in that town finds George MacReady stealing the item during battle . MacReady is a creature of mysterious origins who survives on his wits , resources and whatever he can steal at the moment . To the French he's a spy to the Nazis he's a collaborator which is a nifty arrangement I must say . The Nazis as we know were real big on liberating art treasures from their various conquered countries . But some allied bombs prevent MacReady from stealing The Green Glove and Ford has it and leaves it with a family in an sealed attache case that belonged MacReady . After the war , flashing forward seven years , things haven't gone well for Ford in civilian life and he goes back to France with some hope to find that valuable Green Glove and hoping that's his meal ticket . But when he gets there , he finds MacReady as well who's hoping Ford can lead him to The Green Glove . A few murders later , Ford picking up tour guide Geraldine Brooks to share his fugitive status because MacReady has framed Ford for those murders and it's time for Ford to confront MacReady , The Green Glove and what he really wants from life . The Green Glove is an independent film released through United Artists that was shot entirely on location in France and Monaco . I'm sure it was a good excuse for a vacation for the English speaking thespians of the film , Ford , Brooks , MacReady , and Cedric Hardwicke who plays the village priest and custodian of The Green Glove who prays for its return . It would have been nice to have some color , I'm sure part of the reason it was done in black and white was budgetary and part was so that World War II newsreel footage could be incorporated . Still you're talking about some beautiful area of the planet that two years later Alfred Hitchcock would show us in To Catch A Thief . Paramount gave Hitch a much bigger budget than Rudolph Mate had for The Green Glove . It's not a bad film , in fact it has an exciting chase sequence involving Ford eluding MacReady and his men by taking a rugged mountain trail that is euphemistically called the goat path . Hitchcock couldn't have staged it better . But the cheapness of the production values and a somewhat confused story line prevent The Green Glove from gaining any lasting glory .
395423	2483625	25532	6.0	Murder On A Budget	Murder on the Blackboard is the second of three Hildegarde Withers stories that Edna May Oliver and James Gleason were teamed for . Today the charm of these two people , two of the best character actors that movies ever saw carry this rather dated and melodramatic story . One of the teachers at Edna's school , Barbara Fritchie , winds up very dead and she's quite the lively corpse as the perpetrator keeps moving the body in an effort to be rid of it . In fact the only way the crime is discovered is because that day Edna kept young Jackie Searle after school . Unlike the Thin Man movies where you could have as many as ten suspects or more in a room as Nick and Nora reveal all , this is not MGM with their lavish productions . This is RKO and this studio had a limited budget for their films . We only have four suspects so your chances of guessing who did it increase quite a bit . Edgar Kennedy as the dumb cop who gets clunked on the head and develops amnesia is his usual funny self . In fact he's the foil used to catch the murderer in the end . As for the end , I found it a bit melodramatic for my taste and let it go at that . But for fans of the wonderful Edna May Oliver and the dependable James Gleason this film is a must .
394224	2483625	36824	6.0	" We Build So That Others Can Fight " . . . . . . . . . . . " We Fight For What We Build "	Before writing this review I took a quick look at Wikipedia and the article they have on the Seabees . Despite the fanciful story that Borden Chase wrote here about how the service was founded , the Seabees were actually an idea already thought of by Admiral Ben Morreell the Chief of Navy Supply even before Pearl Harbor . Unlike the war in Europe where the Allies would be looking to take an hold cities with facilities already there , like air fields for example , those planning the war in the Pacific knew that they would be starting from scratch . Airfields , fuel depots , etc . would have to be constructed on jungle islands in the Pacific . So the idea of a separate service for the construction trade was born . Now that we know that the plot of The Fighting Seabees is so much hogwash , let me say that what the film does do very well is show the hazards of what the men in that service faced . Trying to build facilities at the same time as the enemy is firing on them . The scenario in this film is repeated many times over on the islands of the Pacific . As to the story of this film , John Wayne reverses roles here . In most of his war films he's usually the professional military man , here he's the tough , but inpatient civilian who never seems to learn the value of military discipline . Of course being this is the Duke , he does redeem himself in the end in a spectacular manner . A love triangle is tossed in here , rather unnecessarily in my opinion , a straightforward account of Seabee heroism would have been sufficient . Wayne and Navy Commander Dennis O'Keefe are both interested in war correspondent Susan Hayward . This was Hayward's second film with John Wayne , who along with Clark Gable , and Dean Martin , she once described as her three favorite leading men . Her big scene is when she's wounded and thinks she's cashing in , she declares her love for the Duke . Susan Hayward has always been a favorite of mine , but it's on the strength of her performances in her starring roles in the Fifties , not as the sex object in The Fighting Seabees . The Fighting Seabees isn't one of the Duke's top 10 or even top 20 , but it's a decent enough film to sit through even with the World War II heroic bravado that was obligatory at the time this was made . You even get to see John Wayne attempt the jitterbug . During that scene , the Duke looks mighty uncomfortable . He was never going to compete with Fred Astaire for roles .

There's so much gold being smuggled out of the place that the Secret Service is concerned . Remember the USA was on the gold standard back then . So the Secret Service assigns agents George Montgomery , Richard Egan , and Jerome Courtland to go undercover and apprehend this gang . Courtland is young and impulsive , but both Montgomery and Egan think pretty fast on their feet as you'll see as the story unfolds . Just about everybody of any importance in Cripple Creek is involved in the smuggling which is why the government hasn't been able to get a handle on it so far . That's why our agents really have their work cut out for them in this fast paced western . Cripple Creek is a competently made B western with a real twist at the end . Two twists in fact , especially when you find out who the head of the smuggling ring is and what's the purpose behind all the gold smuggling . Cripple Creek is one western not just for the kid trade .
394948	2483625	36677	6.0	As Buffalo Bill saw himself .	If William F . Cody had lived until 1944 he would have loved this film . Most of all he would have approved of the casting of Hollywood's most straight arrow hero Joel McCrea as himself . That's the image Cody liked to convey even if it wasn't exactly the truth . The real Cody was a brave enough hero all right and this film does mention some of the highlights of his real life , the buffalo hunt with Grand Duke Alexei of Russia , the hand to hand fight with Yellow Hand at War Bonnet Gorge , and the formation of his wild west show . The trouble was the real Cody got into show business and he was ballyhooed out of all proportion to his real accomplishments . And Cody was lent himself admirably to exploitation . The movie is the kind of ballyhoo that Cody would have approved . Cody's chief publicist in real life was Ned Buntline who is faithfully portrayed here by Thomas Mitchell . Maureen O'Hara is Louisa Frederici Cody and she's the faithful , but eastern bred wife . No hint of the real marriage problems that plagued the Codys . Linda Darnell and Edgar Buchanan are in this film and I don't really know why . Darnell is an Indian school mistress and Buchanan is a grizzled old army trooper . No real reason for either of them in the film . Darnell is killed at War Bonnet Gorge and she must have been the first squaw who rode into battle . Buchanan's character is also left hanging in the air . Anthony Quinn is Cheyenne chief Yellow Hand and is Cody's worthy adversary on the screen . Buffalo Bill Cody's real contribution was the wild west show . Cody had many imitators , but he was the original . Until Hollywood took over with the making of the first silent westerns , these shows created the myths surrounding the winning of the west . Sadly that part of Cody's life is given short shrift . But Buffalo Bill would have loved this film . Whether today's audience would is open to speculation .
393847	2483625	86356	6.0	A Most Secret Society	The Star Chamber is a film that operates under the premise that the legal system has gone awry and it's up to the judges to apply corrective action to the decisions they officially make in court . Interestingly enough Hal Holbrook who came to that conclusion as Lieutenant Briggs in the Dirty Harry film Magnum Force , is now taking a similar position as a judge . Michael Douglas as a young Superior Court Judge in Los Angeles has reached the same crossroads . After a couple of decisions on procedure that resulted in criminals being cut loose , he starts to question whether the whole criminal justice system is out of whack . That's when Hal Holbrook tells him about a most secret society . A panel of nine judges have taken it upon themselves to overrule their own rulings . Douglas eagerly joins them , but certain things to go off course for him and he questions whether he's made the right career move . The cases that Douglas came a cropper on is stuff straight out of the Law and Order episode file . In that series sometimes I think the judge's rulings are somewhat bizarre . Of course in that series it just makes Jack McCoy and his successor try all the harder to win . It's a nice film , but I do get the feeling that Star Chamber is a Law and Order episode stretched out for a feature film .
395612	2483625	19563	6.0	Twisted	In one of his last silent films , Lon Chaney plays a magician who went into a kind of exile in the Belgian Congo after a fight with a man who stole his wife left him a cripple . He's now known as ' Deadlegs ' and he's used his mastery of prestidigitation to make himself the local kingpin in his neck of the jungle . But even he has to obey certain native customs . He's an embittered and twisted man who has worked out a most carefully engineered scheme involving his late wife's daughter . The man who did steal his wife , Lionel Barrymore is now also in Africa . He contrives to bring the two of them together and both kill and degrade them at the same time at the hands of the cannibals he lives with . Even with this Victorian plot and given the racism of the times , in Victorian Great Britain they would not have had cannibals in Africa because there were no cannibals in Africa . But what did Americans know about Africa ? Still Chaney gives a compelling performance and the role calls for the make up and the contortion that he was known for . In fact in James Cagney's film biography of Chaney there are small portraits of Chaney's various screen roles and West of Zanzibar is one of them . Also look for a good performance by Warner Baxter as the alcoholic doctor who Chaney keeps on a kind of retainer . It's not a great film , far from it , but it is a fascinating look at the life and art of Lon Chaney .
395703	2483625	50594	6.0	A Desperate Bargain	In Kill Me Tomorrow it was Pat O'Brien's turn to be an American actor who was past his prime as a leading man in the states to turn up in a British feature film . The idea was to give it greater marketability in the States . I well remember seeing a lot of these type of films as the bottom half of doublebills in my neighborhood movie theater . O'Brien who had done a lot of noir type features in America fits comfortably with the genre in the UK . Even his Irish countenance is hardly out of place as so many Irish people from Ulster and from the Republic were living and working in Great Britain . O'Brien is an alcoholic reporter working for a Fleet Street paper run by editor Ronald Adam . Adam's lost patience with O'Brien , a year before Pat's wife was killed in an automobile accident that he caused driving drunk . Now he's got a second piece of bad news , his son is ill with a tumor behind an eye and needs one quick operation from a specialist in Switzerland . A thousand pounds would cover it . Ronald Adam has bigger fish to fry than O'Brien's problems . He's running an expose on some criminal rackets in London headed by George Coulouris . A stoolie after giving information to Adam is murdered and Coulouris and assorted hoods come calling . Adam winds up shot and then O'Brien arrives and Adam gives a dying declaration as to who did it . But Pat's concern is the boy and he makes an unusual bargain with Coulouris . For a thousand pounds , he'll take the fall for him and confess to the murder . I have to say that this was one of the more unusual plot twists in a film I've ever seen and for that reason it rates a cut above your average noir film . The production values were adequate , no more than that , the players gave a good account of themselves . Lois Maxwell soon to be Ms . Moneypenny in a few years is Adam's niece and even though she sees O'Brien with gun in hand leaving the premises and calls Scotland Yard , she still believes in him . In fact the scheme is badly thought out , but it was thought out by a desperate man . A timeline and forensics shoot O'Brien's confession full of holes , but he insists on playing it his way as movie favorites do . Two interesting people have small roles in Kill Me Tomorrow . One is former Light Heavyweight Champion Freddie Mills , a sports hero in the British Isles plays one of Coulouris's thugs . Mills met a tragic end a few years later , a suicide that some think was murder . The other person was Great Britain's first rock and roll star Tommy Steele . He sings one of his early hits Rebel Rock in a coffee bar that Coulouris owns and is the headquarters for his enterprises . Tommy is not one of the crooks however . Having seen a more mature Steele in Half A Sixpence , Finian's Rainbow , and The Happiest Millionaire , it was interesting to see him in his rock and roll roots . I shouldn't actually say that because Steele as a performer would have been right at home in the British Music Hall Theater and has been for most of his career . He's got an infectious personality and style that has made me one of his biggest fans . So while O'Brien is in the film for the American market , I've no doubt that Kill Me Tomorrow did well at the British box office with Tommy Steele performing . Kill Me Tomorrow is a good B noir thriller that could hold its own with America's product .
396095	2483625	19788	6.0	Mary Should Have Dialed It Down	For her sound film debut , Mary Pickford chose what she figured would have a built in box office appeal besides her own good name , a long running Broadway play . Coquette which was authored by George Abbott and Ann Preston Bridger and directed by Abbott for Jed Harris , ran 386 performances in the 1927-1928 season . Pickford took over a role popularized by a young Helen Hayes on Broadway . Mary Pickford knew that her days of playing adolescents or young teens were gone . Still there's a trace of the juvenile in her performance as a young and flirty southern belle who her father , John St . Polis , should not be out slumming with white trash like Johnny Mack Brown . Mary's family is of the southern country club set . Mary's got a younger brother played by William Janney and when dad thinks it's him that stayed out late , he's just got a boys will be boys attitude . But when Mary stays out with the forbidden Mr . Brown , that's the proverbial horse of a different color . After that film gets highly melodramatic . The fabled Douglas Fairbanks / Mary Pickford romance was starting to come apart with both of them cheating on the other . It probably helped that Mary was involved with Johnny Mack Brown at the time of the filming of Coquette . Gave her scenes quite a bit of conviction . Johnny Mack Brown who was an All American halfback with the University of Alabama's Crimson Tide before Paul Bryant ever took over , chose the silver screen over professional athletics . For this southern story his Alabama accent no doubt helped as it did later when he became a cowboy hero in a ton of B westerns . Mary does overact a lot here . Then again , all the silent stars who had no real stage training or directors to help them dial it down a bit did the same thing , her husband definitely one of those . Though it wouldn't get a look today , I'm sure Mary's performance in that transition year , probably was one of the best and she no doubt deserved her Best Actress Oscar . Coquette is a play I'm sure you won't see get revived to often . It never has on Broadway . It's dated and highly melodramatic , still for today's viewers it's a curiosity .
395268	2483625	34922	7.0	Take Your Best Shot At Joseph Cotten	While returning from a conference munitions expert Joseph Cotten and his wife Ruth Warrick are taken to a nightclub in Istanbul by the mysterious Edward Sloane where Cotten is almost killed . Magician Hans Conreid is a victim of his own slight of hand , but it's Cotten who's the target as Orson Welles as the Turkish police inspector deduces . Welles's solution get Cotten out of the country so if he's killed at least it won't be on his watch . Welles books passage on a tramp freighter for Cotten and the freighter is loaded with highly interesting characters , one of whom at least is a Nazi assassin . This was another Mercury Theater production with most of the regulars from Citizen Kane / The Magnificent Ambersons back again . Welles's police inspector is a small , but crucial part of the story . Welles , for whatever reason is being unduly modest . Journey Into Fear is undoubtedly the greatest film that Orson Welles never took credit for directing . I can find certain touches here from Citizen Kane , The Magnificent Ambersons , and The Stranger . If he didn't officially direct you can take it to the bank that Norman Foster knew exactly what Welles was trying to get out of each and every scene . Look also here for a good performance by Mexican cinema great Dolores Del Rio as a most mysterious femme fatale on the freighter . Journey Into Fear is a short film , slightly less than 70 minutes running time . I'm sure that RKO had it playing at the bottom end of double features . Maybe we'll see a ' director's cut ' of this one day and know what Welles's own perspective was .
395254	2483625	26056	7.0	Alice Tries To Get A Fellow	Showing her versatility Katharine Hepburn gets her best part since her Oscar winning Morning Glory in the title role of Alice Adams . Alice and Eva Lovelace are worlds apart . Eva leaves her small town in search of fame and fortune in the theater . But poor Alice just wants to compete with the rest of the girls in her midwest Indiana small town that Booth Tarkington wrote about and land a real Prince Charming of a fellow . The Prince shows up at a dance she goes to in the person of Fred MacMurray . She's taken with him , but she's ashamed of her family's rather humble living condition . When MacMurray does come calling they have a family dinner that turns into a real disaster . Kate got one of her Oscar nominations for her role and MacMurray also gets one of his best early film parts as well . Kate's family is also nicely cast with Ann Shoemaker , Frank Albertson , and especially Fred Stone filling out the roles of mother , brother , and father . I do kind of feel sorry for Stone , he's really put upon by his family . In today's world Ann Shoemaker would have gone out and gotten a second job for another income , back then that would have been unthinkable . Alice Adams is a nice nostalgic trip by Booth Tarkington into the lives and mores of small town Indiana . This film was also George Stevens's first major film and he'd work with Kate again in Woman of the Year .
393545	2483625	52745	7.0	To Become A Painter	Back when I was 14 I saw A Dog of Flanders and viewing it today showed it is a fresh and appealing as I remember it . Young David Ladd is Nello Daas the aspiring young artist who lives with his elderly infirm grandfather , Donald Crisp . The two of them take in a cruelly treated dog and name it Patrasche after the dog that famed artist Peter Paul Rubens had . Life's pretty hard for the Daases , becomes doubly so after Crisp dies and young Nello can no longer care for Patrasche . Life also has a funny way of resolving things as well . Besides Ladd and Crisp the only other English speaking player in the film is Theodore Bikel . The continental locations in Belgium and the Netherlands which were one country back at the time this story takes place are well photographed . Ladd , Crisp , Bikel as the artist who recognizes the talent in Ladd give wonderful performances . There was another version of A Dog of Flanders done by RKO studios in the Thirties . It might be nice to see for comparison , but I doubt it matches this one . For this A Dog of Flanders is a timeless family classic .
396689	2483625	45039	7.0	Scandalous Doings On The Mayflower	In doing a review of Plymouth Adventure we should start out by saying this is most definitely not a docudrama about the Pilgrims . This is a film adaption of a novel by Ernest Gebler in which the author threw some things in there that never happened or are the subject of much speculation . Gene Tierney's character of Dorothy Bradford did in fact drown under unknown circumstances , but there is no reason to think it was suicide as opposed to an accident and her yearnings for Captain William Jones of the Mayflower is just part of the Gebler's fertile imagination . He was certainly imaginative enough giving a little scandalous romance into the Puritan community . Plymouth Adventure is a nice tribute to those brave and hearty souls who set forth into an unknown land in which half of them died the first winter , but those who survived creating an American national tradition in the Thanksgiving Holiday . And a black day for turkeys everywhere . Lately the religious right has latched on to the Pilgrims in their efforts to prove America is a Christian nation . Of course once they got here they ran what became the Massachusetts Bay Colony as a theocracy . Still they were an intrepid lot and their courage is beyond question . Spencer Tracy gives a fine performance as the rugged and cynical sea captain of the Mayflower , the chartered ship which takes the Pilgrims from Southampton to an unknown world . I think Tracy drew a lot from some of the characters in Eugene O'Neill's plays in his portrayal of Jones . He has a moment in which he says that people have disappointed him , but the sea never let him down . Could have come from any of O'Neill's works . An Oscar for Best Special Effects went to Plymouth Adventure showing some of the travails at sea the Mayflower went through . Back in its day MGM had a huge water tank that was used for all the sea sagas filmed there . Occasionally other studios rented it out , the facility was that good . Tracy has been there before when he was in Captains Courageous in spirit so to speak . Players like Van Johnson , Lowell Gilmore , Dawn Addams , Noel Drayton , Barry Jones , Kathleen Lockhart play some of the Pilgrim names come down from historical legend . Leo Genn is William Bradford , author of the Mayflower Compact which is cited interminably now by fundamentalist TV reverends as proof of our Christian heritage . Genn who rivaled Ronald Colman as possessor of the most beautiful speaking voice in the English speaking world would be a pleasure to listen to reading the Erie County phone book . My favorite in this is young Tommy Ivo who played William Button the only voyager on the Mayflower to die at sea . His death scene is a heart string tugging experience . Not the real story of the Mayflower voyage , Plymouth Adventure is still good entertainment and a stirring tribute to those who formalized the giving of thanks and the reasons they had to be thankful .
394114	2483625	25124	7.0	Utterly Charming Musical	Even with Ruby Keeler's tinny voice and the fact she doesn't dance a step , Flirtation Walk is an utterly charming musical from the Thirties with Dick Powell at the height of his lyric tenor period . West Point's image has done very well by Hollywood . The West Point Story and The Long Gray Line are the other two big films about the U . S . Military Academy on the Hudson . But this was the first film of a grand tradition . Dick Powell is an army private stationed out in Hawaii who's assigned by his sergeant Pat O'Brien to be a driver for Ruby Keeler , daughter of General Henry O'Neill . She's got a boyfriend in her Dad's aide John Eldredge . But on a moonlight night in Hawaii , the old boy / girl thing happens . Powell receives a rude awakening the next day when he's made to realize the difference in class between officers and enlisted men . Something like the rude awakening John Agar got in Fort Apache when he was courting Shirley Temple even though he was an officer , albeit a newly minted one from an enlisted man's family . So Powell decided he's going to become an officer and sets about applying for West Point . The next half of the film is set in West Point and in Powell's final year , Henry O'Neill becomes the Academy Superintendent bring of course Keeler and Eldredge come with him . Here we have the same plot device that was later used in The West Point Story , breaking precedent in having a woman in the Hundred Nights show for the graduating class . Who do you think the woman that the cadets want ? Allie Wrubel and Mort Dixon wrote two nice numbers that are used in the musical show , Mr . and Mrs . Is the Name and Flirtation Walk . Powell sings them well although he didn't need Ruby's thin voice doing the reprise . During the Hawaiian portion of the film Powell sang Aloha Oe . Why Ruby wasn't given any dance numbers is beyond me since that was her strength as a performer . I should also mention Ross Alexander , who came to a tragic early end three years later , as Powell's roommate at the Point . He was a funny guy and had a nice career going in playing best friends to the hero in film . A sad waste . I think you'll like the characters created and directed by Frank Borzage in this very charming film .
395712	2483625	60011	7.0	The Kids Stand Their Ground	The Monroes was an unfortunately short lived series that never found its audience in the year it was on television . My guess is the expense of shooting the show completely on location in Wyoming was a factor in its cancellation . The Monroe family had homesteaded a piece of ground that was in the middle of a pair of feuding cattle barons . This is reminiscent of the plot of the classic William Wyler western , The Big Country . The barons were the British Liam Sullivan , a very proper English gentleman , but who was rich and employed people who made sure he got his way . And the other group was headed by Robert Middleton who was a self righteous fellow a whole lot like Burl Ives from The Big Country . There was no organized law around , these two guys made the law wherever their territory was . Adding to that was that The Monroes were orphans . Eldest son Michael Anderson , Jr . and eldest daughter Barbara Hershey barely teens themselves try to keep their younger siblings Keith and Kevin Schultz and Tammy Locke together as a unit . If this was civilization , they'd have been dumped on some relative or sent off to an orphanage . Both Sullivan and Middleton would love to buy them out , but the kids stand their ground and attempt to make a home in the wilderness . The Monroes was a beautifully photographed family show and it was unfortunate it wasn't given more of a chance .
394520	2483625	36840	7.0	Frenchman's Creek In Cornwall ?	The absolutely gorgeous color cinematography and the Academy Award winning sets are the main reason that you should Frenchman's Creek today . The players definitely take second place to those outstanding features . The plot at least as it has been altered by the Code is handled with as much skill as the cast can muster covering up some glaring holes . Joan Fontaine is one unhappily married lady of the manor with two small children and a husband who seems more intent on advancing his career in Restoration Great Britain than in her . As was the fashion of that bawdy era husband Ralph Forbes even encourages his wife to pay attention to the courting of his rakish friend Basil Rathbone to Fontaine . When at court many men even pimped their wives for Charles II , this behavior in that era isn't surprising . Well Fontaine can't stand Rathbone so she and the kids take off for the summer place on the Cornwall coast . There's a servant there with a French accent , Cecil Kellaway and later she learns it's been inhabited discreetly by French pirate Arturo De Cordova . He's quite the charmer , if the film were done at Warner Brothers Errol Flynn would have had the part . Joan and Arturo as a couple look like they come right out of one of those romance novels . She even takes up the cutlass with him and she proves to be every bit the swordsman he is . The title of the film comes from a hidden cove near Fontaine's manor where De Cordova's ship lays anchor . Other more recent versions of the story by Daphne Du Maurier have been made that are closer to the original . I can't reveal it , but the ending makes absolutely no sense at all . And it is NOT as Du Maurier wrote it originally . Maybe that was part of the reason that Mexican film idol Arturo De Cordova never got stardom north of the border . He appeared in this film , in a supporting role in For Whom the Bell Tolls and another Paramount feature and then went back to Mexico where he was a leading figure in Latino cinema for the next quarter of a century . De Cordova reminds me a lot of his fellow countryman , Gilbert Roland . Rathbone is a nasty villain and there's also a nice performance by Nigel Bruce as a fatheaded earl who is a Cornwall neighbor . It's the only time that Basil and Nigel did a film together not as Holmes and Watson . Mitchell Leisen directed this film and did a good job given the Code restrictions he operated under . Leisen early in his career worked on several Cecil B . DeMille films and his photography and sets definitely have a DeMille look to them . If you like romantic tales , despite the problems , Frenchman's Creek is one for you .
393731	2483625	52050	7.0	Mob Lawyer Redeemed	Party Girl marked the last film Robert Taylor did under contract for MGM . He did two more on option to them after this , but this one finished his studio contract . Taylor went out on a good nostalgic note with Party Girl . This film must have had some nostalgic appeal for Taylor . It is set back when he would have been first getting the acting bug in Pomona University in the early thirties . Taylor is a gangland mouthpiece Tommy Farrell , who like that other Irish attorney mouthpiece played by Robert Duvall in The Godfather , has only one client . That client is Lee J . Cobb playing Rico Angelo , boss of the Chicago rackets , and a man not to be trifled with . We meet Taylor first as he's getting Cobb's chief gunsill John Ireland off on a murder rap . Also meeting him for the first time is dancer Cyd Charisse who works at a club that Cobb owns . Despite Taylor being crippled with a distinct limp ( which he accents when he addresses a jury ) she falls for him and Taylor goes to Europe for a year of surgeries to repair his legs and hip . Without Taylor around , Cobb makes some bad choices and with Charisse around Taylor starts to question his own ethics . To see how this all gets resolved you'll have to watch a good film with the lead players settling into roles they're comfortable with . With MGM getting out of the musical business parts were fewer and fewer for players like Cyd Charisse . Still because of her role her , she does get to do a few nice dance numbers that fit well with the story told .
394223	2483625	52097	7.0	Introducing David Ladd	Although young David Ladd had actually made a brief appearance in his father's western The Big Land the year before , it was decided that David would make a featured debut in this family picture about a father and son roughing it in post Civil War America . Alan Ladd , late of the Confederate Army , and a widower has searched for and found his son in an orphanage in Pennsylvania . The Yankee soldiers took him and other kids left without homes to northern orphanages . In David's case he's lost his voice due to the traumatic shock of barely escaping the fire from a Union Army shell that burned down his home and killed his mother while Dad was in the army . They're together now and working their way west . They run afoul of Dean Jagger and his roughneck sons in Illinois , but make friends of spinster farm lady Olivia DeHavilland and Quaker doctor Cecil Kellaway . David has a sheepdog who could be valuable . And his father has some critical decisions to make about how to pay for an operation that might cure his son's vocal paralysis . The casting by Alan Ladd of his son David was a stroke of good fortune as the chemistry between the real father and son proved to be a winner . Also Dean Jagger as the one armed sheepherder who has designs on Olivia's land was also very good and against type . Playing Jagger's two sons are Tom Pittman and Harry Dean Stanton . Stanton , God Bless Him , is still around today , a very highly respected character actor who never seemed to lack for work . As for Tom Pittman , he was killed in a car crash while this film was out in theaters . John Mitchum in his memoirs Them Ornery Mitchum Boys , spoke very highly of Pittman , said he had a solid career ahead of him . He also described a harrowing experience where Pittman was missing for several days before police found him and his car and the bottom of a ravine where they had gone off the road . This film marked a reunion of Olivia DeHavilland with Michael Curtiz who directed a whole bunch of her films at Warner Brothers back when she was a young leading lady and favorite leading lady of Errol Flynn . Olivia is older now and delivers a good performance as the wise and compassionate farm woman who takes in the Ladds . With Ladd also producing and starring in this with his younger son , The Proud Rebel is a good family film in every sense of the word .
395917	2483625	51739	7.0	Straight From . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .	A year after winning the Oscar for Best Actor in The Bridge on the River Kwai , Alec Guinness was back to doing comedy , but with a lot bigger budgets than he was used to . His classic parts in Kind Hearts and Coronets and The Lavendar Hill Mob were done without color for instance , which was a much bigger premium for films in the United Kingdom . Guinness has not played such a disreputable character as Cully Jimson since playing Fagin in Oliver Twist . Yet even as he's fleecing all around him including his girl friend Kay Walsh and devoted acolyte Mike Morgan , he still retains that likability . You do end up rooting for him even as he pulls some outrageous scams . Kay Walsh who as David Lean's ex-wife was friends with Guinness and his wife Merula . Lean of course was responsible for Guinness's breakout roles in Great Expectations and Oliver Twist . Guinness got her cast in the role of his long suffering girlfriend and owner of a pub . Sadly young Mike Morgan died right before shooting ended on The Horse's Mouth . Guinness had worked with him previously on Morgan's only other film credit , Barnacle Bill . He gives a nice winsome performance as the young man who just wants to bask in the glow of Guinness's talent and glosses over all the chicanery . I don't think The Horse's Mouth is as good as Kind Hearts and Coronets or The Lavendar Hill Mob . Still Guinness obviously saw the film as a labor of love and the results do show .
394460	2483625	33045	7.0	The Darndest casting decisions	Back in the day of the big studio system , the darndest casting decisions were made . Good old all American James Stewart appearing as a Hungarian in The Shop Around the Corner . Had I been casting the film , the part of Kralik would have been perfect for Charles Boyer . His accent mixed in with all the other European accents would have been nothing . Stewart had some of the same problem in the Mortal Storm also with Margaret Sullavan . Margaret Sullavan was his most frequent leading lady on the screen , he did four films with her . But is only this one where neither of them dies . Sullavan and her husband Leland Heyward knew Stewart back in the day when he was a struggling player in New York . In fact Sullavan's husband was Stewart's good friend Henry Fonda back then . I think only Clark Gable was able to carry off being an American in a cast of non-Americans in Mutiny on the Bounty . Stewart in The Mortal Storm was German , but all the other players were American as well so nothing stood out . But if you can accept Stewart , than you'll be seeing a fine film from Ernest Lubitsch . The plot is pretty simple , a man and woman working in a department store in Budapest don't get along in person . But it seems that they are carrying on a correspondence with some anonymous admirers which turn out to be each other . Also employer Frank Morgan suspects Stewart wrongly of kanoodling with his wife . Though the leads are fine and Frank Morgan departs from his usual befuddled self , the two players who come off best are Felix Bressart and Joseph Schildkraut . Bressart has my favorite moments in the film when he takes off after Morgan starts asking people for opinions . He makes himself very scarce . And Joseph Schildkraut , who is always good , is just great as the officious little worm who is constantly kissing up to Frank Morgan . You really hate people like that , I've known too many like Schildkraut in real life who are at office politics 24 hours a day . Sad that it pays off a good deal of the time .
395611	2483625	28197	7.0	Legend of Old California	Two later versions of the story of Joaquin Murietta with Jeffrey Hunter and Ricardo Montalban stuck closer to the truth about the famous bandit from the California Gold Rush Days . But certainly Warner Baxter , dusting off his Cisco Kid accent certainly made a dashing Murietta . I'm not certain why Gilbert Roland who was always a personal favorite of mine didn't play this part , it seems like something he was born to do . Though Baxter's portrayal is honest and sincere I doubt that Latino groups today would let a Warner Baxter play Murietta any more than they would have him play Cisco Kid . California was the most heavily populated of the area that was known as the Mexican Cession which came into the United States as a result of the Mexican War . Even at that American immigration was gradually overwhelming the Mexican population just as their ancestors overwhelmed the largely peaceful Indians in California . But when gold was discovered in 1849 that was it . By the next year California was admitted to the union it had grown that exponentially . Such depredations as depicted that turned Murietta into a bandit were a fact and interesting that in 1936 that was shown on screen . Ann Loring and Margo do well as the women in Murietta's life and J . Carrol Naish was just starting on that colorful career of his that had him play every kind of ethnic type on the screen . He made a great Three Finger Jack whose small band of outlaws Murietta takes over by leadership and charisma . Perhaps Murietta's story such that can be verified is due for a more modern retelling . Still this is a fine version of the story .
393108	2483625	61282	8.0	Just Add on a Color and a half hour	The recent demise of Jack Warden put me in mind of this good , but forgotten show . I well remember it from the late sixties . It was a tough and rather realistic look at the life in the precinct squad of the NYPD . All three of the regulars here went on to have good careers and other television series . Frank Converse and Robert Hooks as the two detectives and their supervisor Jack Warden belong on anyone's A list of players . NYPD ran for two seasons , got so-so ratings and got the axe . My guess is that it was a generation ahead of its time . It also suffered from the half an hour format . When shows like Hill Street Blues and NYPD Blue came on the scene , they were an hour length and there was more time to develop the characters . But those shows and many others owe a debt to NYPD . Hopefully some cable channel will pick it for reruns .
394120	2483625	61278	8.0	Did the producers know what they were putting out ?	Way back in the day Jay North , having become too big to be Dennis the Menace any more , he went to India with Clint Walker and did a very nice film named Maya . Kind of confusing because Maya is an elephant , not a group of native Americans from the Yucatan . The film did a good box office and North got a TV series out of it . Well the so-so ratings and the huge expense of location shooting in India proved to be prohibitive and Maya the TV series got cancelled . The movie had Jay North searching for his father in India and doing it with another kid , an orphan Indian boy played by Sajid Khan . In the movie they had a kind of Huck Finn / Tom Sawyer relationship which was cute . The TV series eliminated Clint Walker , but the premise was the same , North's search for his father accompanied by Maya the elephant and Sajid Khan . But now both kids were well into puberty and they had eyes only for each other . I mean these two now about 15 or 16 acted very much like they were in love . No one and I mean NO ONE except the elephant was a part of their world . I remember an episode where Sajid Khan was reduced to tears at the thought of North going back to America . Both Khan and North enjoyed a burst of bubblegum popularity . Sajid Khan had a short lived singing career . But in those pre-Stonewall days I wonder how many young gay males identified with those two kids and felt kind of validated in their feelings . I really hope TV Land channel gets those episodes and runs them . There weren't many , but I'll bet they become a bit gay hit now .
396606	2483625	26126	8.0	By Yon Bonnie Banks And By Yon Bonnie Braes , The Sun Shines High On MacLaurel	Stan and Ollie travel all the way to Bonnie Scotland to collect on an inheritance left by Stan MacLaurel's late grandfather . Both he and his cousin June Lang are provided , but she's not of age and she's under the firm guardianship of Colonel Vernon Steele and his scheming Mrs . , Anne Grey . William Janney , the clerk in lawyer David Torrence's office is in love with June Lang , but she's spirited off to India during the British Raj . Never mind , Stan and Ollie and poor young Janney also find their way there as the scene of the plot shifts from Bonnie Scotland to India with the Highlanders . It's all a pretty thin plot , but good enough to hang some of Stan and Ollie's best screen moments on . One of my all time favorites is when Ollie has an encounter with a snuff box which was half of Laurel's inheritance the other half being a set of bagpipes . Another is when Stan and Ollie try to use the bedsprings in their hotel to grill some fish and nearly burn poor Mary Gordon's establishment down . After the boys go into the Indian Army they become the bane of the existence of their old nemesis , Sergeant James Finlayson . In the end Janney , Finlayson , and the boys provide a hilarious ending to a tribal rebellion . Films like Lives of a Bengal Lancer and Charge of the Light Brigade about the British Raj take one good beating from producer Hal Roach and his intrepid and incomparable stars . For fans of Stan and Ollie the world over .
393483	2483625	52735	8.0	" The British Soldier Can Stand up to anything , except the British War Office . "	Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas , both players who chose rather successfully to chart their own careers , decided on their third co-starring film to jointly produce it as well . The property chosen was George Bernard Shaw's The Devil's Disciple which takes place in the northern theater of operations in the American Revolution . Shaw's wit is going full tilt here as he's having a great old time blasting upper and middle class pretensions of British society . The vehicle he uses is General John Burgoyne who lost the Battle of Saratoga to the rebel army which guaranteed French recognition and European aid for the colonists . Both Lancaster as Parson Anthony Anderson and Kirk Douglas as committed non-believer Dick Dudgeon play larger than life characters here as they usually do and both have their moments . But in fact this film is stolen completely out from under them by Sir Laurence Olivier as General Burgoyne . As a previous reviewer noted , Shaw wrote the best lines in the play for the Burgoyne character . But it takes the skill of a player like Olivier to bring them off . Burgoyne was very much a product of Georgian Great Britain , a cynical man in a very cynical business . By the way Harry Andrews as Major Swinton does an excellent job essentially as Burgoyne's straight man . Andrews is a pompous sort of character and Olivier tosses the bon mots off him like a handball player . The story involves Dudgeon being mistaken for Anderson and being sentenced to hang for rebel activity . Anderson arouses the populace and sheds his parson's collar for rebel activity and saves Dudgeon from the noose . Burgoyne quits the town he was occupying and goes off to his destiny at Saratoga . But in this case as in a lot of Shaw plays , the story isn't as important as the commentary . And when the commentary is delivered by Olivier , it's being brought to you by the best .
392798	2483625	26529	8.0	A Flannelmouth Fool	I don't doubt that Victor McLaglen won his Best Actor Oscar for this film by dint of a three way split among the Mutiny on the Bounty leads of Clark Gable , Charles Laughton , and Franchot Tone who were all in the same race . But The Informer is still a fine film because John Ford wouldn't have gotten his first Best Director Oscar if it wasn't . No split involved in his award . The movie and the story by Liam O'Flaherty that it is based on involves a poor simpleton of a man named Gypo Nolan who was once a member of the Irish Republican Army . He was cashiered out of it for some imbecilic stunt he pulled and wants back in . He's down to his last pence and if he can't get back in , wants enough for passage to America . There's a twenty pound reward for information leading to the arrest of a former comrade named Frankie McPhillip played by Wallace Ford . In a moment of weakness he goes to the Black and Tan constabulary and informs on McPhillip . The IRA is pretty anxious to find out who ratted McPhillip out and they're pretty certain it was McLaglen . He hasn't the wit to really cover his own tracks . He does make a feeble effort to implicate another man named Peter Mulligan played by Donald Meek . He also picks up a hanger-on played by J . M . Kerrigan . The whole action of The Informer takes place in 1922 in Dublin from about six in the evening to early the following morning . Of a necessity it is shot in darkness and shadows , making it possibly the first noir thriller . Had it been done post World War II The Informer would have ranked as a great noir classic , like Odd Man Out or the The Third Man which it bares a lot of resemblance to . John Ford knew this world very well . He took some time off during the Rebellion and was in Ireland at the time and had a brother who was in the IRA . His real name before having it anglicized was Sean O'Fiernan . Preston Foster plays the IRA commandant Dan Gallagher . In the book Gallagher is a harder and meaner man than Foster has him here . My guess is that John Ford wanted him as a sympathetic character to give movie fans some rooting interest . He makes it clear that Foster has to eliminate the informer because the Black and Tans will grab him and get quite a bit more out of him and put the whole organization in peril . The IRA trial scene is the highlight of the film . When Foster asks Donald Meek whether he recognizes the authority of their court , Meek ain't in a position to say no . The King's justice and writ does not run here . It graphically illustrates at that point despite occupation by army troops and constabulary , the British are indeed losing their grip on the population . Of course The Informer a rather grim story has its John Ford touches , but rather fewer than you would expect . Even as McLaglen is spending his money on a drunken spree , the IRA is constantly in the shadows watching him and counting every farthing . The Informer is a tale well told about Ireland in a grim and dismal time .
396293	2483625	52278	8.0	" I Gotta Burnin ' Yearnin ' To Learn "	Now that musicals were unfortunately fading away , Doris Day was slowly finding a new niche in screen comedy . She was busy being leading lady to some of Hollywood's biggest male stars and they didn't come bigger than the king , Clark Gable . Also her new hit songs were the title tunes of her films and very few sold as big as Teacher's Pet . It's one of her million selling singles and it definitely contributed mightily to the box office for this film . In the story line it's whole lot like some of the films she'd be doing in the future with Rock Hudson . Doris is a professor of journalism who arouses the ire of Walter Burns like city editor Clark Gable . He writes her a nasty letter and then when he's ordered to apologize to her he goes to one of her night school classes where she reads the letter out loud and trashes him in front of the class . Not taking this lying down , Clark enrolls in her class under an alias and if you don't know where this one is going you haven't seen any of her films with Rock Hudson . Gable does very well in the city editor's role . In fact in mentioning Walter Burns , I'm surprised Gable was never cast in The Front Page . He would have been perfect casting either as Burns or Hildy Johnson the reporter . Doris is an idealistic professor who's the daughter of a William Allen White type figure as a previous reviewer mentioned . She's got a lot to learn from Gable as well with his practical approach to journalism and romance . Gig Young is in a Gig Young part . Gig plays a psychologist boy friend of Doris's and his rivalry with Gable is pretty funny . He got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor for having one of the great screen hangovers of all time . He lost to Burl Ives however for It's A Big Country . My favorite scene in the film is with Gable and Vivian Nathan who plays Nick Adams's mother . Adams is a young high school dropout who idolizes Gable as a guy who made it the hard way . When Gable fires Adams after being exposed to Doris's ideas , Nathan's scene with Gable thanking him is for me the best in the film . Teacher's Pet is sadly dated because of the way the media has evolved . Just as Broadcast News updated The Front Page , Teacher's Pet would be a great film involving the internet now for someone like Julia Roberts to do . Till then though , this one is entertaining enough .
394674	2483625	34889	8.0	The Duke's A Druggist Dude	In Old California finds John Wayne in the highly unusual casting of an eastern dude from Boston going west to California to seek fame and fortune as California becomes American territory due to the Mexican cession . He might be an easterner , but you wouldn't expect John Wayne to be any kind of cream puff . He'd better not be because he's starting to interest Binnie Barnes who is the gal pal of Albert Dekker , the local boss of Sacramento and the surrounding area . Wayne likes Barnes , but he's got his heart set on Helen Parrish who the daughter of a local Spanish don . You wouldn't expect pharmacy to be such a rough business , but it sure turns out that way In Old California . Out of jealousy , Dekker conceives a plot to rid himself of his rival . Ultimately however it's Dekker who gets caught in the web of his on intrigue . Edgar Kennedy and Patsy Kelly make their one and only appearances in a John Wayne film and they make a real nice pair for the comic relief in the film . Also look for a good performance by Dick Purcell as Dekker's far slimier and deadlier brother . The California Gold Rush saves the Duke from one of Dekker's nefarious schemes . The Gold Rush also brings in the typhoid epidemic where Wayne's pharmaceutical knowledge and supplies are needed to fight the disease . The epidemic also brings on a blazing gun battle as well as the Duke leads a wagon train through to the gold camps . Binnie Barnes has a nice role herself as a wise cracking saloon girl with the proverbial golden heart . Their are plot elements here of other John Wayne films like The Spoilers and Reap the Wild Wind . In this one it's John Wayne who has the role Ray Milland had against him in Reap the Wild Wind . In Old California is one of Herbert J . Yates's better films featuring his meal ticket . Between loaning him out to the bigger studios and centering Republic's big budget features around the Duke , Yates and Wayne did a masterful job in making him a movie legend .
395768	2483625	43553	8.0	Romance In The Italian Campaign	The original story behind Force of Arms was written by Richard Tregaskis , war correspondent from World War II , best known for Guadalcanal Diary . Of course some would argue that Tregaskis borrowed a lot of the plot from the previous war that Ernest Hemingway chronicled in A Farewell to Arms . Still it's a nice romantic story brought to life by the teaming of William Holden and Nancy Olson who did four films together back at this time . Nancy Olson in fact got an Oscar nomination in the Best Supporting Actress category for Sunset Boulevard which was their first film together . After his company is relieved on the San Pietro front in the Italian theater , William Holden meets WAC Nancy Olson and a romance blooms . But it's back to the front , in fact Holden gets himself wounded twice during the course of Force of Arms . Actual combat footage from the Italian campaign is used along with newsreels from the liberation of Rome where the climax takes place . There are good performances here also by Frank Lovejoy and Katherine Warren as the respective commanding officers of Holden and Olson . This was Bill Holden's first great romantic role along the lines of Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca . It's a harbinger of what we would later get from him in films like The Bridges of Toko-Ri and Love Is A Many Splendored Thing . It's a sadly neglected film , one of Bill Holden's better films and should not be missed .
395200	2483625	25774	8.0	Bing helps a damsel in distress	Bing Crosby had done one previous film with a college setting in College Humor . In that one he was a music teacher . Now he's on the other side of the classroom as student / composer in She Loves Me Not . He's about to graduate and get married when a complication in the form of Miriam Hopkins comes into his life . She's fleeing from gangsters who think she's seen a shooting . The doer , Warren Hymer , is hot on her trail . She's a dancer in a nightclub in Philadelphia and she flees abruptly , not even changing her costume . She has just enough money to get to Princeton where she tells her sad tale of woe to Bing . And of course Bing and pal Eddie Nugent take her in . What follows is a lot of fast paced humor involving Crosby's fiancé , the college administration , a Hollywood publicity man , and the gangsters Hopkins is fleeing from . Along the way Bing makes the acquaintance of Kitty Carlisle who is the daughter of Princeton's Dean of Students played by Henry Stephenson . They sing beautifully together and would do so again in Crosby's next picture , Here Is My Heart . Songwriting chores were split on this film . Mack Gordon and Harry Revel contributed two songs , Straight from the Shoulder and I'm Humming . . . I'm Whistling . . . I'm Singing which were good . But the hit song of the film comes from Leo Robin and Ralph Rainger , Love In Bloom . 1934 was the first year that the best song category was put in the Academy Awards sweepstakes . Bing Crosby with Love In Bloom had the first of 15 nominations , the most by far of any artist introducing an Oscar nominated song . Love In Bloom lost that year to the beautiful music and heavenly rhythm of The Continental . Love In Bloom served also as the title tune of one of Dixie Lee Crosby's last films before she retired from the screen to raise Bing's first family . But the song finally got a home being heard as the squeaky violin introduction for Jack Benny for almost forty years on radio and television . It became identified with him so much that many people don't know Bing Crosby introduced it as a serious ballad . Bing and Kitty sing Love In Bloom well together although the main weakness of the plot is that their romance gets a bit sappy at times . It does detract from the comedy . Nevertheless She Loves Me Not is pretty funny and the inimitable Mr . Crosby is in excellent voice on some excellent tunes .
395861	2483625	60748	8.0	" Some Kind of Man "	If you remember The Carpetbaggers , you'll note the scene where Jonas Cord , Jr . tells his surrogate father Nevada Smith about how he researched and discovered his real story . That his real name was Max Sand and that when three vicious outlaws killed his parents , he spent years tracking them down to mete out justice . From that small speech in The Carpetbaggers came the motion picture Nevada Smith which starred Steve McQueen in the role that was destined to be Alan Ladd's last . Talk was that Ladd would have liked to do it himself , but he would never have been convincing as the young Nevada . The outlaws who McQueen is on the trail of are three of the most vicious ever created in Hollywood . Karl Malden , Arthur Kennedy , and Martin Landau each admirably fit their despicable characters . So does Brian Keith as Jonas Cord , Sr . who became McQueen's friend and benefactor . There are three substantial women's parts in this film . Janet Margolin is the Kiowa Indian girl who went into the white man's world and became a prostitute who cares for McQueen when he's wounded in the Kiowa Village . And there's Joanna Moore , a most grateful widow of Martin Landau who wants to thank Steve good and proper for her new station in life . She's the one with the title quote for the review . One of the unsung roles in the film however is that of Suzanne Pleshette who plays a Cajun swamp girl who gets bitten by a water moccasin while helping McQueen and Arthur Kennedy bust out of a prison work camp in Louisiana . His treatment of her is McQueen at his most ruthless , he's just using her to get out a jail to get a crack at Kennedy . In fact he deliberately got himself thrown into prison for that purpose . When Pleshette realizes that when she's dying in the swamp of the untreated snakebite , it's maybe her finest moment in her film career . Nevada Smith was a very good part for Steve McQueen , it stands high with his legion of fans and holds up very well forty years later .
394227	2483625	43262	8.0	The Mountain Men , Our Real Pioneers	When one watches western films of the latter half of the 19th century , the settlement of the west was on a course that was nothing but bad for the American Indian . As good as some westerns are , always lingering in the back of any viewer's mind is the thought that no matter what the predicament of a given hero / heroine in any film is the fact that the might and power of the United States Cavalry will ultimately tip the balance towards the white man . But the fur trappers of the early half of that century faced a far different situation . They were few and the Indians at that point outnumbered them . These people as typified by Clark Gable and the rest of the cast in Across the Wide Missouri were the really brave ones in our history . They wanted to trap their beaver and sell their pelts and the last thing they wanted was wholesale immigration of settlers . It took a lot of nerve to live in that lonely existence , days and weeks at a time where you couldn't count on a troop of soldiers to bail you out of trouble . I'm a big old sucker for films about the earlier west and two good ones came out at this time , this one and the following year from RKO , The Big Sky . I give the nod to this one thought because it was done in color and on location . Gable gets one of his best post World War II parts as the sturdy Flint Mitchell , mountain man who falls big time for Indian princess Maris Elena Marques . While grandfather Jack Holt approves of a white husband for his granddaughter , the match don't sit well at all with Ricardo Montalban his successor . The climatic duel between Gable and Montalban is staged very well indeed and quite thrilling . Playing various fur trapper roles are Alan Napier , James Whitmore , John Hodiak and most of all Adolphe Menjou . Though one normally expects the debonair Mr . Menjou in tuxedo , he's really quite good as the French Canadian trapper and sidekick to Gable . Maria Elena Marquess got her one and only chance in Hollywood and did well as the Indian princess . She was already a name in Mexican cinema and became an even bigger star down there due to this film with Clark Gable . This film marked the farewell performance of Jack Holt who died soon after it was completed . His career spanned all the way back to the earliest years of Hollywood . He makes a very impressive chief of the Blackfeet . Gable was a rugged outdoors-man in real life , he liked to fish and hunt and brought his fourth wife , Lady Sylvia Ashley on location . Unfortunately Lady Sylvia was not a big fan of the great outdoors and her experiences roughing it contributed to the Gables getting unhitched . Director William Wellman kept things going at a good clip and though Across the Wide Missouri is slightly over 75 minutes for an A film , it's still a great item and rates being an A film for its cast and its production values .
394100	2483625	86993	8.0	H . M . S . Bounty , A Troubled Ship	The latest retelling of this tale shifts a lot of the blame about the voyage over to Fletcher Christian and the fact that he and a lot of the crew had simply gone native . One of the great villainous portrayals on the screen is Charles Laughton's Captain Bligh from the stirring 1935 film . Laughton is pretty unforgettable with that jutting lower lip and that bellowing voice at the crew . Anthony Hopkins has given us a kinder , gentler view of Bligh which may be far closer to the facts . Bligh certainly was a stern taskmaster as a captain of a naval vessel . In fact he served with distinction in several naval battles during the Napoleonic wars . What he unfortunately had was a sarcastic tongue , something not really needed for what in fact was a peaceful voyage to obtain breadfruit plants . Scurvy which is caused by a Vitamin C deficiency ran rampant on the ocean going ships of the time , none more so than in British ships because they had the most of them . This was a pretty important voyage , to bring back Tahitian breadfruit to see if it could be cultivated in the climate of the United Kingdom . Maybe the mistake was in not sending a civilian ship to do the job , who knows . Anyway Bligh punished men who got out of line , no more so than what was normal . The problem arose when after months at sea , his crew got just too used to frolicking among the female population of Tahiti . That would also unfortunately include Bligh's second mate Fletcher Christian , played in this version by Mel Gibson . It wasn't Bligh's fault they lingered in Tahiti , the plants had to be mature enough to stand the voyage to Great Britain . Nevertheless the lack of discipline there , contrasted with what was expected of British seaman on a naval vessel , a return to that life was what led to the mutiny . Certainly Fletcher Christian by all accounts was a charismatic guy , he would have to have been to get the men to mutiny . He was portrayed by four charismatic actors , Errol Flynn , Clark Gable , Marlon Brando , and now Mel Gibson . Only his intervention prevented the men from killing Bligh and a few others . What I like most about this version is the fact that it does give due attention to Bligh's remarkable voyage in a long boat to Timor which was some 1500 miles from where he and the loyalists were cast adrift . It was a remarkable piece of seamanship , no mutinies during that voyage . The luckless Captain Bligh also had the misfortune to be the Governor of New South Wales , appointed by the Crown , and was overthrown there in a power struggle with the merchants of the colony . That didn't help his historical reputation a bit . Among the crew of the Bounty you will find Daniel Day-Lewis as John Fryer who Bligh replaced mid voyage with Fletcher Christian and Liam Neeson as one of the mutineers . Laurence Olivier plays Admiral Hood who led the court of inquiry that cleared Bligh of blame for the mutiny . Still Hopkins and Gibson dominate the film with their skills and talents . Who knows who might bring the saga of this troubled ship next to the screen . This story has fascinated us for generations .
393347	2483625	78966	8.0	The Worst Case Scenario	It was harrowingly close , but The China Syndrome received the worst kind of publicity when as it was going into theatrical release , the accident at Three Mile Island Nuclear Power Plant happened . I still remember the whole country's attention was glued onto hourly bulletins coming out of Harrisburg , Pennsylvania . And wouldn't you know it , a scientist in The China Syndrome describes the worst case scenario as rendering an area as large as the state of Pennsylvania uninhabitable . Less than a decade later in the Ukraine at Chernobyl , the Soviet Union in its last days dealt with such a crisis that didn't get righted in the nick of time . The China Syndrome once again became a relevant movie . The film is more about cutting corners for safety than it is about being anti-nuclear . Jack Lemmon is a man who lived with nuclear power all his life as the captain of an atomic power submarine . What angers him and sets him off to create the confrontation that climaxes the film is the stupidity and greed of the power company managers . Stupidity and greed though are commodities found every day . The problem with them is that there are places where it can be tolerated less in human society . Lemmon shares star billing with a couple of famous Hollywood offspring , Jane Fonda and Michael Douglas . Jane is a TV News reporter who is constantly being assigned to puff feature stories and just happens to be at a nuclear power plant when an accident occurs . The cover-up by her own station and her later meeting with Lemmon set off the chain of events depicted in The China Syndrome . Fonda's best scene I thought however was with Peter Donat a news executive with her station . Take a look at her facial expressions as Donat fluffs off the importance of the story and patronizingly tells her that her very beauty demands she stick to puff pieces . Fonda knows she's got something and sticks with it . Michael Douglas plays her iconoclastic cameraman , this was a typical part for him back in the day . In his TCM tribute to his father Kirk Douglas , Michael said he opted for roles showing sensitivity . Still I could have seen a young Kirk Douglas in this part . What to do about energy for industrial and post industrial nations , a vexing problem that will bedevil our government for a couple of generations to come . This film shows what can happen with a dependence on nuclear power . Our current problems geopolitically in the world stem in part from a dependence on fossil fuel , specifically oil . Everything we use brings consequence some unforeseen . The real hero of the film in my opinion is Wilford Brimley , Lemmon's colleague at the nuclear power plant . In the end Brimley really steps up to the plate . See The China Syndrome to know what I'm talking about .
393216	2483625	35979	8.0	Henry Van Cleave , You've Had A Wonderful Life	At the top of the list of Don Ameche's best films , in that first five , Heaven Can Wait is always listed . As a film with that inimitable Ernest Lubitsch touch , how could it miss ? The very dapper an elegant Mr . Henry Van Cleave has arrived at the entrance to the underworld where he feels given the risqué life he's led on earth , he feels he belongs . To convince the Prince of Darkness , Laird Cregar , that he should be his guest for eternity . And he tells him his life story to prove his case . We see Don Ameche at the various stages of his life during this film and the picture we get of him is a very decent man , but one who could not resist a pretty face or a pretty ankle , depending on which order he noticed them . Nevertheless he does meet the girl of his dreams , Gene Tierney , and while she kept him on the straight and narrow , it wasn't without a look here and there to the side . Some of Hollywood's favorite character actors show up in this film which is one of the reasons it's such a favorite . It's hard to pick from a cast that includes Signe Hasso , Spring Byington , Marjorie Main , Louis Calhern , Eugene Palette , Allyn Joslyn , and Charles Coburn any particular favorite . But I'd have to say my favorite is Laird Cregar . There has never been a more cultivated or civilized Satan on the screen before or since . Cregar's performance more than anything else is symbolic of the Lubitsch touch . Heaven Can Wait is an interesting commentary on our system of morals . Don Ameche's character is absolutely sure he's going to hell and if you listened to fundamentalist ministers he sure would be . Apparently for Laird Cregar's place though , if you spread some happiness in life you certainly don't qualify for admission . An interesting criteria , don't you think . Don Ameche is charming , Gene Tierney is beautiful , the script is witty and bright , the direction faultless . Can't do better than that .
393653	2483625	36855	8.0	Entering our English Lexicon	It is not often that a proper name or title enters the common use of any language , but maybe the highest possible praise Gaslight could receive is the fact that the title is now a verb . To gaslight someone now is to do little deliberate things and blame articles disappearing or misplaced on a person in an effort to make them think they are losing their minds . That is exactly what the suave sophisticated continental Charles Boyer is trying to do to his new bride Ingrid Bergman in the house that they live in . It was previously occupied by Bergman's aunt , a noted soprano who was murdered several years earlier . A good mad act is always guaranteed to draw Oscar attention and in this case it got Ingrid Bergman her first Academy Award . She is really something to watch as the poor woman really starts to believe she's losing her mind . Charles Boyer goes against type in this film . Usually the charming European of many nationalities besides his native French , Boyer starts out the film in a typical Boyer mold . But he gradually changes into a hardened stone cold killer . The audience ever so gradually realizes he didn't marry Bergman for love . Boyer was also nominated for a Best Actor Oscar , but no one was beating Bing Crosby that year in Going My Way . Joseph Cotten plays the stalwart Scotland Yard inspector and a very young Angela Lansbury has an early part in Gaslight as a tart cockney maid . George Cukor directs it all with a Hitchcock type flair that even the master of suspense would tip his hat to . In fact I'm surprised that Alfred Hitchcock didn't consider Gaslight as a film property for himself .
394725	2483625	201048	8.0	A Lot Of Faith	Father Flannagan said there was no such thing as a bad boy and founded Boys Town to prove his theory . With only one test case , but a real hard case , priest Cesar Romero has that particular theory tested by young Roger Mobley . Mobley was 14 at the time he made The Runaway and he had done a similar role as a Mexican street kid in Dime With A Halo . Here he's an orphan urchin who sleeps in a room in a barn and hustles for whatever money he can make . All the time he's looking for his father . He stows away in a truck driven by Father Cesar Romero , but gets stopped at the border crossing . The officials of both sides of the border give him over in custody to Romero . Oh , there was another stowaway on the truck , a young puppy that Mobley took with him that turns out to be a greyhound . One fast greyhound to boot . The dog turns out to be Mobley's salvation . The Runaway is a heartwarming boy and his dog story shot completely on location in Tijuana , San Diego and many points in between in the USA and Mexico . On the shelf for 45 years , it just made its debut on television on TCM . I wonder what Roger Mobley must be thinking , 45 years to see what could be his best performance as a juvenile .
395026	2483625	24610	8.0	Our State Fair Is A Great State Fair	Overshadowed in this day and age by the two musical film versions that succeeded it , this version of State Fair provides a great showcase for the personality and talent of American institutions Will Rogers . Although I was surprised to see that in the billing , Fox's main female star at the time , Janet Gaynor , was billed above him . The power of what winning the first Best Actress Oscar can get you . It was probably only natural that the two would eventually be in a project together . Gaynor always played good girls , fresh from the farm like Melissa Frake , her best example of that is Esther Blodgett in A Star Is Born . As for Rogers , his patented brand of homespun humor had already established his legend . When I did a review of Junior Bonner , I said that the film was simply the story of a rodeo family's day at the Presscott Frontier Rodeo . State Fair is a simple film , without any pretensions ; the story of the Frake Family and its visit to the State Fair where all of them have an unforgettable time . I wouldn't believe it , but Will Rogers never had a better straight man than his prize hog Blue Boy who perks up and struts his stuff when an attractive sow comes to his attention . But he's far from the only one who finds romance . Janet Gaynor meets small city reporter Lew Ayres who says that even though the paper is a Republican one , don't blame him and the rest who have to work there to make a living . Republicans were not highly thought of in the wake of the Depression back in the day . Her wholesomeness attracts him . As for son Norman Foster he gets quite a lesson in love in a most explicit before the Code encounter with trapeze artist Sally Eilers . Surprising for a Will Rogers film in my humble opinion . Even Louise Dresser comes home a winner , taking first prize in just about everything she prepares due to Rogers spiking her cooking liberally with some schnapps . He knew the best way to the judge's heart . State Fair is a great piece of nostalgic Americana and a great showcase for that American institution named Will Rogers .
392972	2483625	24962	8.0	That Catherine Was Great and Popular	Although Marlene Dietrich was a far more glamorous Catherine the Great , closer to the real one was definitely Elizabeth Bergner in this British production from Alexander Korda . The former Princess Sophia of Anhalt-Zerbst , one of many small pieces of turf in Germany before that country became a country instead of a geographical expression , pulled off something unique in history . She came as a promised bride to the tsarevitch who in this case was Peter , nephew of the Empress Elizabeth of Russia . Through her own will and genius for intrigue , this Queen Consort , without a drop of royal blood of Russia in her , got to rule Russia and well for over 30 years after deposing her husband . Woman must have done something right . The film here like the one in Hollywood ends with the deposition and death of the Czar and Catherine taking over . We don't see the regal , confident , and promiscuous empress Catherine was to become . We see her as a shy and overwhelmed German Princess who grows in her role as her husband won't in his . Catherine grows in her character as Elizabeth Bergner does in this part . Sam Jaffe as Peter is far closer to the mark of the real character of that unfortunate soul than Douglas Fairbanks , Jr . is in this film . Yet Fairbanks gives an extraordinary performance , far from the swashbuckling parts that his father patented on the silent screen . In fact both the Fairbanks were in the UK at the same time . Fairbanks senior gave his farewell screen performance in the Private Life of Don Juan and his son did about seven films for four years of which this is probably his best effort . The pleasure loving Empress Elizabeth as done by Flora Robson is light years different from Queen Elizabeth in Fire Over England and The Sea Hawk that Robson did later , but still very nicely done . Alexander Korda perfectly captured the mood and feel of old Romanov Russia as taken over by a usurper , a popular one , but still a usurper .
396495	2483625	50631	8.0	Why Am I Gone About Those Girls ?	Cole Porter's final film score and next to last music written for any media is Les Girls . The same team producer Sol Seigal and writer John Patrick who produced and wrote the adaption of The Philadelphi Story for High Society worked with Porter again and this time George Cukor was directing . It's a good film , but I've got the feeling that it could have been a whole lot better . One of the criticisms that Porter used to get annoyed with was the perennial ' it isn't up to Cole Porter's standard ' and then you'd look in the score and see a lot of classics . Can-Can is the best example of that . But in the case of Les Girls Porter admitted this to be true . According to the George Eells biography of Porter , he was starting to suffer the decline in health that would eventually end his life in 1964 . He did have surgery to bypass an ulcer and was not feeling up to par . Still the numbers are mostly for a vaudeville act , Barry Nichols and Les Girls so they're serviceable to a bright Rashomon like plot . The members of the act are Gene Kelly and the girls are Mitzi Gaynor , Taina Elg , and Kay Kendall . Kay's written a memoir that includes an alleged suicide attempt by Elg and she's suing her in an English court . As we get testimony from Elg , Kendall , and Kelly , they all give out with different versions . It's also clear he had his fling with all of them at one time despite his alleged no fraternization policy . Elg has the best ballad of the score , Ca C'est L'Amour which sounds like something that might have been written for Can-Can and discarded . Cole Porter discards are better than a lot of composer's best efforts . The sparkling Kay Kendall was never shown to better advantage on the screen than with You're Just Too Too in a duet with Kelly . And Cole Porter wickedly satirizes Marlon Brando and The Wild One in Why Am I So Gone About That Gal with Kelly and Mitzi Gaynor . In addition to this being Cole Porter's last film score , this film also marks Gene Kelly's last full blown musical . He did do other musical numbers in films like What A Way To Go and Young Girls From Rochefort and Xanadu , but this was the last musical he did . They were getting way too expensive to make , something Kelly learned from behind the camera when he directed Hello Dolly . Even with a score that Cole Porter himself wasn't thrilled with , Les Girls is still a fresh bit of film making . And since it's original to the screen , the Porter wit is not edited severely . All in all four great musical performers , three of them Les Girls .
393461	2483625	35015	9.0	Trust Fund Baby Gets His Comeuppance	For his second feature film directorial effort Orson Welles assembled a lot of his Citizen Kane alumni , Joseph Cotten , Erskine Sanford , Ray Collins , and Agnes Moorehead , for this screen adaption of the Booth Tarkington novel The Magnificent Ambersons . He didn't bring Gregg Toland along to film the thing , but Stanley Cortez definitely learned how from Gregg as to what Welles wanted . The Amberson mansion sure looks like a lost relation to stately Xanadu and the same deep focus photography is present . And those fill the screen closeups and telling shadows , still there and used to great effect . Richard Bennett is the head of Amberson clan and he's got a lovely daughter in Dolores Costello . Joseph Cotten is the hardworking young man who desires her hand as do many . But he tries a bit too hard and she coquettishly rejects him and marries good and dull Donald Dillway . The have a son who she spoils rotten in the person of Tim Holt . Tim Holt as George Amberson Minafer would today be called a trust fund baby . The thought of work or some kind of profession is alien to him and he has an intense dislike for Cotten as much as he'd like the daughter he has from the marriage he made after Dolores rejected him . My favorite scene in the film is Holt with Cotten's daughter , Anne Baxter , in a carriage where Holt is telling her about his disdain for any profession let alone any manual labor . But while being a person of leisure as one in Holt's class is born to be , he'll use his money in various charitable enterprises to benefit the less fortunate . Sounds like a budding Michael Moore . Holt got great reviews for this part proving here as he did in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre that he was capable of being more than a B film cowboy . But that's where he returned to and probably of his own choice . Also about that time war service interrupted his career as well . Joseph Cotten belongs to that vanished race of gentleman players that used to grace the screen . They don't write parts for people like him , William Powell , Don Ameche , Ronald Colman , etc . But being a part of these two immortal Orson Welles creations assures him a place in cinema history forever . The saga of the Amberson family covers a slice of American social history from the Gilded Age to the Progressive Era . Besides the editing that Welles claimed butchered his film , The Magnificent Ambersons failed to find an audience in 1942 . America's entry into World War II was on most people's minds then . A story about a bygone era just didn't sell . Citizen Kane which also had a bygone era story was also about a guy still very much on the scene . All the controversy about William Randolph Hearst sold a lot of tickets for Citizen Kane . The Magnificent Ambersons certainly didn't have that kind of a built in publicity gimmick . Even with the cuts that Welles objected to the film still has great merit , a fine group of players telling a good story . Tim Holt got his comeuppance , but not quite the way he expected . Then again so did just about everyone in the cast .
395870	2483625	43633	9.0	Master of the Cultured Ad-lib	Frank Capra in his autobiography called Bing Crosby , " the master of the cultured ad-lib . " A lot of time Crosby would drop several ad-libs into a script and Capra kept them in . According to Capra they were betterthan what the screenwriter had written . Of course partnering with Bob Hope in several films and thousands of radio , television , and live shows Bing had to be quick on the uptake . Capra wanted to do another of his populist films like Mr . Deeds etc . , in the three picture deal he signed with Paramount . But after doing Riding High and doing it well with Bing Crosby , he wanted to do one of his type film . The Paramount brass said no , but since he was unhappy at Paramount they agreed to drop their last picture commitment on his contract for one more Crosby film . Just make a good one . Capra was as good as his word . This film is entertainment plus and a lot of that has to do with the chemistry between Bing and Jane Wyman . Most of Crosby's leading ladies were nice women who just melted with the Crosby charm . Not so here . Ms . Wyman gives as good with the wisecracks as Crosby does and is no pushover . What she is here is a fiancé who's grown tired of waiting for her man who's out gallivanting all over the world as per his job as correspondent . When he finally does come back he has two French orphans in tow . But Jane's decided to marry millionaire Franchot Tone . Bing has to get her back or those kids will be deported . That's where the fun starts . By now Paramount was giving Crosby vehicles some respectable budgets and that included letting Frank Capra hire a lot of his favorite supporting players . Those folks make a Capra film an enjoyable experience . Franchot Tone does nicely as millionaire rival and critics were astounded at Alexis Smith who turned out to have a real flair for comedy . Funny parts she wasn't getting at Warner Brothers . She plays a " kissing " cousin of Franchot Tone and figures prominently in Bing's machinations . They were also astounded at Jane Wyman who nobody realized could sing . Why they were is beyond me since she did start in musical choruses . The song In the Cool Cool Cool of the Evening by Hoagy Carmichael and Johnny Mercer won an Oscar for best song and became one of Bing's million selling records , dueted with Jane Wyman on screen and on vinyl . The rest of the score is by Jay Livingston and Ray Evans who were under contract to Paramount and for some reason or other never wrote another Crosby film score . Probably because Paramount didn't assign them because many years later they scored and arranged a whole album of duets with Bing and Rosemary Clooney called That Traveling Two Beat Time . And Bing did pretty good with a song written for his friend Bob Hope by them called Silver Bells . One of the Livingston-Evans songs was a patented philosophical number called Your Own Little House . A nice song on record , on screen it's a great impromptu style number that so many of Crosby's seemed to be . Sung with a group of kids who are French war orphans , Bing does some gentle kidding of fellow entertainers Jimmy Durante and Maurice Chevalier . This is one of Bing's best and great entertainment .
393812	2483625	43599	9.0	The Centerpiece of Mario Lanza's Career	Since musicals have both gone out of fashion and are incredibly expensive to make without all the talent needed to make one under contract to a studio , I doubt we will ever get a real life story of Enrico Caruso . But if everything else was in place it was no accident that no Hollywood studio attempted the task until Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer had Mario Lanza under contract . No one else could have done it , I doubt whether it will ever be tried again . And why should it . I think Enrico Caruso himself would have been satisfied as to how his singing was portrayed on screen . For his tenor voice was his life , his reason for being on the earth . To say that liberties were taken with his life is to be modest . Caruso , like the man who portrayed him , was a man of large appetites although with a lot more self discipline . He had numerous relationships with several women and fathered two out of wedlock sons who are not in this film . His contribution to the recording industry is treated as almost an afterthought . He's shown in a recording studio once late in his life . Actually he started recording right around the turn of the last century and together with Irish tenor John McCormack for RCA Victor made the recording industry what it became . When Caruso and McCormack were at their heights you had to practically inherit a ticket to see either of them perform live . But a lot of immigrant Italian and Irish families had a phonograph and a record or three of either of these men . It's why both became the legends that they are . What the film does have is some beautifully staged operatic arias done by Mario Lanza , a taste of what he might have become had he the discipline of a Caruso to stick to opera . The Great Caruso won an Oscar for sound recording and received nominations for costume and set design . Mario himself helped popularize the film with an RCA Red Seal album of songs from The Great Caruso . Unfortunately due to contractual obligations we couldn't get an actual cast album with Ann Blyth , Dorothy Kirsten , and Jarmila Novotna also . Though Blyth sang it in the film , Lanza had a big hit recording of The Loveliest Night of the Year further helping to popularize The Great Caruso . If you're looking for a life of Enrico Caruso , this ain't it . If you are looking for a great artist singing at the height of his career , than you should not miss The Great Caruso .
392767	2483625	52990	9.0	Surviving In A World Of Galoots	The Last Angry Man marks the farewell big screen appearance of Paul Muni who had been for about a dozen years concentrating on his stage career . Muni goes back to his roots in this one playing an elderly Jewish doctor in a mixed Brooklyn neighborhood of 1959 . He upholds a lot of values that the present generation seems to have lost . He's a man content to be a general practitioner and even makes house calls . He lives with wife Nancy Pollock and nephew Joby Baker . Baker is an aspiring journalist and writes a story about his uncle when he saves a young black woman played by an unknown Cicely Tyson at the time . A local paper picks it up and it comes to the attention of TV producer David Wayne who thinks the doctor might be a good subject for a television documentary . Wayne gets a lot more than he bargained for , Muni is quite the opinionated crusty old soul and not willing to just go on the air like a Queen for a Day contestant . He likes his life the way it is , doing good work for it's own reward and enough to live on . This puts him in conflict with Baker and with Wayne who are a pair that could have been working models for Budd Schulberg's Sammy Glick . People like that who want a quick buck without the work , Muni calls galoots and they seem to be multiplying in his life . Daniel Mann directs a finely tuned cast in support of Paul Muni's swan song . This film marks an early appearance of Billy Dee Williams as a brain tumor stricken teenager who his mother , Claudia McNeil brings to Dr . Muni for help . Muni of course takes him to his lifelong friend , a Park Avenue neurosurgeon played by Luther Adler . Adler has one of his great screen roles also here . He and Muni both went way back over 40 years to the Yiddish Theater on New York's Lower East Side . That helps in both of their performances as lifelong friends and colleagues because they actually were . Others of note in the cast are Dan Tobin as the sleazy network executive Betsy Palmer as Wayne's supportive wife and Robert F . Simon as the head of the drug company that would sponsor the show . It's Paul Muni's show and a really grand farewell to one of the finest actors ever .
393766	2483625	94669	9.0	A Death In Palestine	Appointment with Death was the last theatrical release of that series of Hercule Poirot mysteries . I'm sure Peter Ustinov probably could have done others . I wouldn't be surprised if in fact the BBC Poirot series starring David Suchet which we in America saw for many years may have killed the more expensive budgeted big screen Poirot that Ustinov did so well . This particular mystery finds Hercule Poirot on holiday and in the company both on ship and later in British mandated Palestine in the mid Thirties of an American family headed by a tyrannical stepmother played by Piper Laurie . She has one grown daughter and three stepchildren one of whom is married . All live with her and the terms of her late husband's will give her complete control of the family fortune . The power of the purse keeps the whole family under her thumb . Laurie's come a long way since she was a matron in a women's prison . Another woman along on the trip who's come along way is a character based on Lady Nancy Astor , an American born woman who married a title and now has a seat in Parliament played by Lauren Bacall . She's traveling with a companion played by Hailey Mills . Also along on the trip is David Soul , Laurie's family attorney and Jenny Seagrove as a young doctor . On an excursion out in the desert Laurie turns up dead and the mystery is afoot . Of course Poirot through careful questioning and a gathering of the suspects eventually finds out who the real murderer is . The film has of course an impressive cast which also includes John Gielgud as the local police inspector in Jerusalem . A young Arab boy also dies during the film , killed because he witnessed the murder and can identify the culprit . That particular act robs us of any sympathy we might have had for the perpetrator . Appointment with Death also benefits from good photography , shot on location in both Israel and Italy with interiors done in London . All the Peter Ustinov Poirot films are of excellent quality and are a great introduction to the work Agatha Christie .
393654	2483625	51201	9.0	The Goal Is Always Justice	In a recent biography of Billy Wilder , Agatha Christie is quoted as saying that this was the best adaption of her work ever done on the screen . I can't praise Witness for the Prosecution any higher than that . Tyrone Power in his farewell film plays Leonard Vole who befriends a dotty old widow played by Norma Varden . She even rewrites her will leaving him the bulk of a very large estate . When she's murdered , Scotland Yard arrests Power . Power's solicitor Henry Daniell retains a dream team for defense of John Williams and the recently recovered Charles Laughton . Laughton is recovering from a heart attack and against medical advice plunges into the case . Laughton also has to deal with the efforts of his assigned nurse Elsa Lanchester to keep him following doctor's advice . The original play this was taken from concentrated completely on the Power character and the machinations of his wife . Wilder built up the character of the nurse and barrister Sir Wilfred Robards so that they almost equaled the screen time of Mr . and Mrs . Vole . So much so that Charles Laughton was nominated for an Academy Award in 1957 , but lost to Alec Guinness . Marlene Dietrich plays Mrs . Vole . She's a war bride over from Germany and she's got her own agenda going . Her performance and what her character does is the key to the whole film . Dietrich probably would have gotten an Oscar nomination herself , but due to the fact that if her performance was hyped up for Academy consideration , the element of surprise would have been lost in the film . Wilder in fact apologized to Marlene for that . The Anglo-Saxon legal system's goal is justice . Justice is served though not quite in the way it usually is in Witness for the Prosecution .
393743	2483625	44760	9.0	A Classic Story Made Into a Classic Film	Of the four films that Robert Taylor called his " iron jockstrap movies " Ivanhoe is probably the best . Filmed on location in Great Britain with a classic mixed cast of American and British players , Ivanhoe is a film for those of us who like their heroes strong and true and their causes noble ones . It's a noble cause in every sense of the word . King Richard the Lion Hearted is held captive by Duke Leopold of Austria on a return from the Crusades . Leopold's demanding a hefty sum and Prince John who is regent over in England ain't in no big hurry to pay it . So it is one Wilfred of Ivanhoe , a Saxon knight on Crusade with the Norman King , who takes up the burden of raising that ransom . As Walter Scott wrote the story , Ivanhoe is a pretty virtuous fellow who takes those chivalry vows quite seriously . If this had been made at 20th Century Fox Tyrone Power would have been Ivanhoe . But MGM had a perfect actor for Ivanhoe in Robert Taylor , especially with the success Quo Vadis had previously . Joan Fontaine is the prim and proper Lady Rowena and Elizabeth Taylor is the lovely Rebecca ready to be martyred for her Jewish faith . She's the key to this whole film . She's crushing big time on Ivanhoe , but it is Norman knight Bois Guilbert who has it bad for her . George Sanders who plays Bois Guilbert has the most complex role in the film . He's genuinely in love with Liz Taylor , but all she sees is the oppressor of her people in him . Of course by his reasoning the Normans are enjoying the spoils of conquest in England which they've been doing since 1066 even though it's over 120 years at this point . Nevertheless he's a brave knight and a worthy opponent of Ivanhoe . Guy Rolfe as Prince John has an interesting part as well . Except in a Doctor Who episode I've never seen a good characterization of Prince later King John . Guy Rolfe is no exception . When Elizabeth Taylor is on trial for witchcraft and sorcery and Ivanhoe challenges the verdict of the court with a wager of battle , Rolfe knows how Sanders feels about Taylor . Yet in an act of supreme cruelty he chooses him as the court's champion . I suppose the idea was for Rolfe to get some kind of sadistic amusement at Sanders's discomfort . It costs Rolfe dearly . Other good performances come from those four reliable players Finlay Currie as Cedric of Ivanhoe , Felix Aylmer as Isaac of York , Robert Douglas as Hugh DeBracy , and Emlyn Williams as Womba the Squire . In that 19th century romantic age of literature Walter Scott did much to elevate the ideals of chivalry to what we popularly accept them today . Of course back in the day those knights weren't all that chivalrous all the time . But this film heeds to that bit of philosophy about American popular myths , " when the legend becomes fact , print the legend . " Or film it as the case may be .
392742	2483625	51745	9.0	" Hesto , Presto , One of Cary's Very Besto "	Cary Grant , prominent diplomat and widower , is trying to get acquainted again with his three kids , Paul Petersen , Mimi Gibson , and Charles Herbert . He's also got a sister-in-law , Martha Hyer , crushing out on him big time . But after the youngest kid , Herbert , wanders away after a concert , he meets Sophia Loren who is also running away from her conductor father , Eduardo Ciannelli . They are soul mates Herbert and Loren and before long she's moved in on the Grant family . Which is forced by circumstance I won't reveal to live on a houseboat in the woods in Maryland . The Houseboat and its many problems lend itself to a whole lot of physical problems and one rather dramatic one , when one of the kids nearly drowns . Cary gets a lot of good mileage out of the comedy . This was Cary and Sophia's second film together and it was one big improvement on the overblown Pride and the Passion . No doubt that the two of them were still involved from The Pride and the Passion lends a lot of truth in the scenes Grant and Loren play together . Also look for a nice performance by Harry Guardino who's the one who is responsible for the group being on the Houseboat . Houseboat is a nice family comedy and hasn't aged a bit from the Fifties when it was made .
393979	2483625	25028	9.0	They're what you see a show for	One of the nice things about those Warner Brothers Depression musicals is that you can forget some of the sillier aspects of the plot and just enjoy the wonderful nonsense created . Dames certainly classifies as wonderful nonsense . A wacky millionaire who's a sideline puritan is going to leave a bequest to a cousin and her family providing that they are of good moral character by his ideas . The wacky millionaire is Hugh Herbert and the cousin is Zasu Pitts , her husband Guy Kibbee and her daughter Ruby Keeler . There's another distant cousin Dick Powell who's already out of the will because he's an actor . Back then theatrical folk were held in some disdain by polite society , though that's hard to believe now . Also some eyebrows might have been raised with Dick's involvement with Ruby . But then again the president of the United States was married to his fifth cousin . I'm sure the brothers Warner knew that full well when Dames was released . Dames of course is remembered for those wonderful Busby Berkeley numbers and one of the biggest movie songs ever in I Only Have Eyes For You . Introduced by Dick Powell it was never commercially recorded by him though dozens of our best singers have done so . It's a favorite of mine for sure . Last but not least Dames features the always captivating Joan Blondell who's not above a little blackmail to achieve her ends . A girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do . She's featured in the Girl at the Ironing Board number , a great piece of Berkeley magic . We can't forget the title song because as Dick Powell sings , it's what you see the show for . And in that finale they're sure enough of them to satisfy any red blooded male .
396102	2483625	44229	9.0	Bud and Lou for the Ages	The wonderful nonsense that made up the comedy of Bud Abbott and Lou Costello is carefully preserved and is to be treasured in this two season television series which I can remember from my earliest days . It seemed like it was in syndication forever on WPIX TV in New York in the fifties , sixties and seventies . Made those Honeymooner episodes look like nothing . A careful viewing of all their feature films will find all their famous routines in them at one point . But if you just want to see the boys do their stuff and not have to worry about the plot of some movie , than by all means try to acquire these shows on VHS or DVD . The plots of these shows are absolutely meaningless . The common thread was the fact that they didn't pay the rent at their rooming-house and as their harassed landlord said on one show , they were going into their second year . Of course the fact that they didn't want to work and when they got jobs , they inevitably blew them up didn't help matters . The landlord was Sidney Fields who went back in burlesque as long as Abbott and Costello did . Fields had one magnificent temper and when Abbott wasn't abusing his hapless partner , Fields was . He got almost as many laughs as the boys did , in fact they could have been a trio act . Another tenant at the rooming-house was Gordon Jones , known as Mike the cop , though in one episode it did slip that his last name was Kelly . He also was driven to distraction by Costello's antics . There was the beautiful and ever patient Hillary Brooke who Costello was crushing out on big time . And there was Joe Kirk , in real life Lou's brother-in-law , who was the ever excitable Italian , Mr . Baciagalupe . Kirk was a poor man's Henry Armetta and the boys constantly made him lose his " temperature " . Somewhere on some cable station these shows are still playing , with comedy that is absolutely timeless and will be enjoyed a thousand years from now . One thing I did wonder when I got older . Why didn't Fields just take Abbott and Costello to Landlord and Tenant Court . He had more than enough grounds .
396723	2483625	70666	9.0	Diogenes , Have You Looked In The NYPD ?	For his second Academy Award nomination and his first in the Best Actor category , Al Pacino essayed the title role in Serpico , the true story of an incorruptible cop and a man who Diogenes could have ceased his search for an honest man with . As I'm sure many idealistic young people do , Frank Serpico joined the New York Police Department with hopes of making a difference in society . What he found was a systemic culture of corruption there and faced his own crisis of conscience . Nobody's ever decided where the line is to be drawn . A free meal at a local diner all the way to big payoffs from drug dealers . The police in this film run the gamut , except for Pacino who won't take a dime . His very honesty makes him a marked man . The only problem that I have with Serpico is that he tends to be too self righteous . I do wonder if the real Frank Serpico , who is very much alive , is that way . He seems to repel all possible allies . Personally , I think at some point he should have put his papers in and taken the lesser pension at a point way before the near tragedy which does happen to him . If the script makes him too self righteous , Al Pacino's skill as a player and Sidney Lumet's direction level it out and make Serpico someone we can sympathize with . There's a lot subtlety there in every move , in every facial expression , Al Pacino has even under that heavy beard . Serpico got a nomination for Best Screenplay adapted from another source , it was adapted from Peter Maas's biographical study . Al Pacino unfortunately lost the Best Actor Oscar that year to Jack Lemmon for Save the Tiger . Oddly enough Save the Tiger is about another man at a crossroads in his life and his choice is break the law . Sidney Lumet does love New York , so many of his good films are based and shot there . This one is no exception . I recognized many of the locations of the scenes . Every New Yorker ought to see this film just for that . And I think Diogenes can end his search .
395594	2483625	36431	9.0	A great story of human dignity .	Jean Renoir managed to flee France because of the Nazi invasion and spent World War II turning out some pretty good films in America . Maybe the best is this heartfelt tribute to his beloved and occupied France . He got the best possible actor for his protagonist . Charles Laughton could play tortured and flawed human beings like no other actor ever could in the English speaking world . Here he is a French schoolteacher , middle-aged , shy , and mother dominated by Una O'Connor . And he's afraid of his own shadow . He also loves neighbor and fellow schoolteacher Maureen O'Hara and she's got a fiancé who's a collaborator and a brother in the resistance played by George Sanders and Kent Smith . It's all these people's story and even the local gauleiter Walter Slezak is not a simple brute as Nazis are so often portrayed . The story involves Laughton's growth as a human being , seeing what is happening to his town , the people around him , and most of all to the school to both the children and the teachers . The last twenty minutes of the film are almost exclusively his . In both a courtroom and a classroom , he has some brilliantly delivered speeches explaining to the town why they must resist the evil upon them . For me the best scene is in the courtroom where Laughton is accused of murder and throws away a carefully prepared script that Slezak has offered him . He tells the town what they need to hear and then declares his love for O'Hara and the reasons for him doing what he's doing . During that part of Laughton's speech the camera focuses totally on Maureen O'Hara and her reactions to Laughton's words . It's a beautiful crafted scene by a great director . A film classic for the ages .
396050	2483625	44105	9.0	" Like A Thief In The Night "	Although the film is a work of fiction , The Tall Target is based in part on an actual incident that involved an attempt to assassinate President - elect Abraham Lincoln on his way to Washington to assume the presidency in early 1861 . A planned stop in Baltimore was canceled and Lincoln was spirited into Washington in the wee small hours of the morning with no kind of fanfare or publicity , as he put it , ' like a thief in the night ' . Anthony Mann directed this 19th century noir type film starring Dick Powell as a New York police sergeant who gets wind of a plot to murder Lincoln in Baltimore . After he confides his suspicions to colleague Regis Toomey , Toomey winds up dead and Powell's more convinced than ever of the rightness of his belief . He boards the train that Lincoln is scheduled to board in Baltimore on to warn him , but Powell's got a lot of people on that train ready to do him in and he doesn't know who to trust . The Tall Target is very similar to Mann's other classic Winchester 73 in the tautness of the direction and script . There isn't one wasted frame of film in The Tall Target and the suspense is kept throughout , even though history tells us Lincoln dodged a bullet that day . Mann assembled a very strong supporting cast for Powell that includes Adolphe Menjou as a militia colonel called to the colors , Leif Erickson as a Bowery tough , Will Geer as an officious conductor , Marshall Thompson as a southern hothead and resigned West Point cadet and his sister Paula Raymond . Best performance in the film though is that of young Ruby Dee who plays a slave to Thompson and Raymond traveling with them . She proves to be the only real friend Powell has on the train . It's a quiet understated performance of dignity and strength . By the way in case any of you are wondering why she doesn't just run away and claim her freedom , a couple of things stops her . The Dred Scott decision for one which obliterated the Missouri Compromise of 1820 with the northern free and southerns slave states and the new Fugitive Slave Law from the 1850 Compromise . However Dee knows that freedom is coming her way and soon . The Tall Target is one excellent film , one of the best from Dick Powell when he decided to stop making musicals . Catch it absolutely .
394709	2483625	59573	9.0	Could Have Been A Lot More Daring	Watching this film I was struck at once with how daring it was and how daring it could have been . A Patch Of Blue is dated very much like that other Sidney Poitier movie , Guess Who's Coming To Dinner , a milestone and daring for its time , but old fashioned today . But that was about as much as America could handle back then . Newcomer Elizabeth Hartman plays the blind and childlike Selena Darcy living with her white trash mother Shelley Winters and alcoholic grandfather Wallace Ford . She's got one miserable existence , living in an apartment she rarely goes out of and stringing beads for necklaces to contribute to the family income . When she decides one day to go to the park for a bit of fresh air , she meets up with Sidney Poitier , an office worker who also likes the park during the day as a change from his night job . Hartman's been blind since the age of five , the result of Winters throwing a caustic substance at her husband during a fight and hitting the child . That child services never took this kid away at some point is beyond me . Shelley makes an extra buck or two as a hooker besides and she brings her tricks up to the apartment . All in all one miserable excuse for a human being . She's abusive drunk or sober and Wallace Ford is usually drunk . The innocent relationship that Hartman has with Poitier and it's abundantly clear no sex is involved opens up a whole new world for Hartman . She's not been taught the most rudimentary skills for coping with the world that a blind person would normally get , such as reading Braille . If this were done today the setting might have been the urban south instead of Los Angeles , some place like Atlanta for instance . And Poitier's lack of sexual enthusiasm would simply be explained with the obvious answer , that his character is gay . But four years from Stonewall that wasn't in the cards . Still A Patch Of Blue is a fine film about a young woman's reach for freedom and responsibility with the help of a new found friend . Shelley Winters won her second Oscar for Best Supporting Actress to go well on her mantel with that one for The Diary Of Anne Frank . Newcomer Elizabeth Hartman was nominated for Best Actress , but lost ironically to a most amoral Julie Christie in Darling . A Patch Of Blue marked the farewell appearance of Wallace Ford , he died as I well remember while A Patch Of Blue was still playing in theaters . A daring film for its time with a timeless message , if a remake was done today a lot could and would be changed .
396846	2483625	59575	9.0	Reconnecting With The World	The Pawnbroker is maybe the best of Sidney Lumet's New York based films . It tells the story of Sol Nazerman , former professor from Germany , Holocaust survivor , now making a living as a pawnbroker in Harlem . Rod Steiger got an Oscar nomination for Best Actor . If he had lost to Sir Laurence Olivier for Othello I might understand , but losing to Lee Marvin for Cat Ballou ? All three are performances on different planes of acting . This is one of those films like Cyrano De Bergerac which rise and fall on the ability of the person performing the title character . With a minimum of dialog and a performance mostly of anguished expressions , Rod Steiger conveys the story of a man who's really seen the worst of what life has to offer and expects very little from humanity . And in Harlem no one rises among the dregs of society that usually come peddling the last of their dreams to him . This film was done in 1964 and that was also the year of the Harlem riots , sparked by an NYPD officer killing a black teenager . My guess is that Sol Nazerman's pawn shop , white owned that it was never saw a scrap of damage . That's because one of the reasons he stays in business is because of a little money laundering on the side for Harlem racketeer Brock Peters . Unfortunately Steiger's assistant Jaime Sanchez sees a huge amount of cash being deposited in the safe after office hours . He's an ambitious young man and not really deciding which side of the fence to fall on . It's more his indecision that leads to tragedy later on . The highlight of the film for me is Steiger's equivalent of a ' hath a Jew not eyes ' speech when he explains to Sanchez just why the Jewish people have the ' mercantile heritage ' as he puts it . Too often it's forgotten that in all the places for thousands of years where Jews couldn't own land , this was what was left to them . On a side note that's one of the reasons for the State of Israel developing its own collective agricultural institution , the Kibbutz . It was to get Jews deliberate in touch with the land , to grow things on it and develop an attachment to it . Some of the other cast members of note are Geraldine Fitzgerald as a neighborhood settlement house social worker who tries to penetrate Steiger's catatonic personality and a really wonderful bit by Reni Santoni as a junkie trying to pawn a radio and jonesing to beat the band . Still the film is Rod Steiger's show , one of the few times he carried a film by himself and he does it magnificently .
394770	2483625	52561	10.0	Sensational Murder In The U . P .	Until Reindeer Games a few years ago , Anatomy of a Murder had to be the only film that ever had as a locale , the Upper Peninsula of Michigan . It's a pretty woodsy area as shown in the film with lots of tiny towns and villages and very right wing in its politics . A homicide occurred in one of those towns , an army lieutenant killed the owner of a nightspot who he says raped his wife . The lieutenant played by Ben Gazzara is in need of a good lawyer and he hires James Stewart who was the former prosecutor in the county . Stewart's team such as it is consists of secretary Eve Arden and former mentor Arthur O'Connell , a reformed alcoholic whose hold on reform is shaky to say the least . The prosecution consists of Brooks West and a hired gun from the attorney general's office George C . Scott . There's a lot of resentment against Scott in that maybe the locals don't like the inference their own prosecutor isn't up to the job . Anatomy of a Murder gets James Stewart into a courtroom for the only time in his film career though he did play lawyers in other films . He exudes the same kind of down home folksiness that characterized his later Hawkins TV series in the seventies . Otto Preminger took his cast and they operated like a finely tuned machine , they could have all been from the same repertoire company and played with each other for years . Anatomy of a Murder got seven Oscar nominations including one for James Stewart as Best Actor and George C . Scott and Arthur O'Connell in the Supporting Actor category . Unfortunately this was the year of Ben-Hur which blanked just about everyone else out of any awards which also included Best Picture and Best Director for Otto Preminger . Charlton Heston tells a story in his memoirs that Stewart on the night of the Oscars the following year told Heston he had voted for him and was pulling for him as he had already won one in The Philadelphia Story . Only a man of real class would have done that . Stewart was named Best Actor for 1959 by the New York Film Critics though . Besides all those previously mentioned , kudos should go to Lee Remick as Gazzara's slatternly wife and Kathryn Crosby as the deceased's roadhouse manager who provides some key last minute evidence at the trial . Anatomy of a Murder is one of the best courtroom dramas ever put on film , catch it by all means .
393732	2483625	70640	10.0	Life Ain't About Simple Choices	Save the Tiger is about lost illusions of youth and the things some of us have to do to merely keep treading water . Jack Lemmon is the head of a garment factory which has suffered some losses over the past few years and he and partner Jack Gilford see few options that will save them from bankruptcy or worse . The best of these options is to start an arson fire in their factory and hope the insurance payoff will cancel their debts and afford a fresh start . Gilford is against it on moral principles , but Lemmon is a guy who can't afford morals at this stage as George Bernard Shaw once put it . Still he looks back on his youth and the things and people that moved him back in the day and wonders how he got in the mess he's in . It's not supposed to be like this for people like him who've had ideals and tried to play by the rules . In his facial expressions , his vocal intonations , in every move of his body and soul , Lemmon becomes Harry Stoner the latest convert to cynicism . It's what got Jack Lemmon his Second Academy Award , this time for Best Actor . Interesting that this very cynical film came out the year that a whole lot of Americans became very cynical as Watergate was unfolding before them . Arson fire is a tricky business and Lemmon puts himself in the hands of Thayer David who I think gives his best screen portrayal here as the professional arsonist . Listening to him , as creepy as he sounds , he comes off as a man who knows his business . He even at one point offers to return the down payment given him when he explains that insurance will never pay off with all the fire regulation violations Lemmon and Gilford have in their place . It's a business with him and no fatalities must occur , otherwise it's a Law and Order episode . Jack Lemmon was one of the best around , could do all kinds of comedy and drama with equal skill . Building on the characters he created for Billy Wilder , he's an older man now who's in no position to start from scratch again . Lemmon plays a character that all of us over 40 can definitely relate to . Save the Tiger is a serious and thought provoking drama about choices each and every one of us could face some time in our lives . It's universality of theme will make it an enduring classic .
394933	2483625	34891	10.0	" God Bless This Ship And The Men Who Serve In Her "	It's ironic indeed that in Noel Coward's greatest screen role he played a part so atypical of what we expect from that most witty and erudite of artists . There's a lot good in In Which We Serve , but if you are expecting Coward bon mots , skip this film . Whatever else Coward was , he was one patriotic British citizen who loved his country and wanted to do his bit in World War II . The incident in which In Which We Serve is based on what actually happened to the the destroyer HMS Kelly in 1941 off Crete which was sunk after taking a few of the enemy with her . The ship was commanded by one Louis Mountbatten of the royal family and a good friend of Coward's . Coward's character while not a member of the royal family is still of the upper crust of British society . Mountbatten when war broke out used his considerable royal connections to get into a combat assignment when war broke out . The sequences in which Coward's ship is sunk and the actions of Coward and the crew hews pretty close to what happened to Mountbatten and the men of the Kelly . While we Coward and his survivors clinging to life rafts and bits of wreckage , the audience gets a series of flashbacks revolving around three men , Coward , CPO Bernard Miles , and Seaman John Mills . We see them at peace and at war with the women they are involved with who are Celia Johnson , Joyce Carey , and Kay Walsh . This was total war for Great Britain , something until I don't think Americans could fully appreciate . While the men are at sea , the women live under threat and fact of bombardment by air . Their scenes are every bit as important as the battle scenes at sea , showing a people totally mobilized . In small roles you can find such people as James Donald , Michael Wilding , and Richard Attenborough all part of the crew . Attenborough in particular makes a vivid impression in his part . The Earl of Mountbatten made a series of televised memoirs in the early seventies that didn't reach American television until after his assassination in 1979 . It was about 10 episodes and they dealt with all facets of his career . Before he retired in fact he became the First Sea Lord of the British Navy . But one episode dealt with the sinking of the HMS Kelly and the men of the Kelly who survived year after year got together for a remembrance . Some footage was shown of one of the gatherings . I wonder if they still do that and how many men are left from the ship survivors . In fact it's altogether fitting and proper that this review be dedicated to Lord Louis Mountbatten who not without controversy served his country well and faithfully throughout a long a productive life . And of course this review is also dedicated to the brave men of the HMS Kelly , those that have passed on and those who might still survive . They and the other members of the Royal Navy kept their country from invasion for almost a thousand years and in the case of World War II kept the world from a totalitarian nightmare . And they couldn't have a better film than In Which We Serve to perpetuate the memory of their deeds .
395180	2483625	53125	10.0	" War Is Hell , Even When It's A Cold One . "	Following up on his two previous masterpieces , The Thirty Nine Steps and Saboteur ; Alfred Hitchcock put together his ultimate chase film with elements of both coming into Ernest Lehman's screenplay . I've seen figures that show in terms of box office and later video sales and rentals , North By Northwest was Hitchcock's most successful film financially . At this point Alfred Hitchcock's name over the title could sell a movie , but I'm sure he didn't mind having Cary Grant in it to draw the movie going public . This was Cary's fourth and final appearance in a Hitchcock film and I think it is his best performance in one . Like in the two films I cited , Cary is innocently caught up in a web of intrigue and he got there by just answering a telephone page at a hotel dining room . He took a call right after someone paged a George Kaplan and the bad guys think he's Kaplan . And he gets grabbed . It's a devilishly difficult situation for him because there ain't no George Kaplan . He's a fictitious guy who was invented by one of our spy agencies ( that's never identified in the story ) to take the heat off an agent very close to masterspy James Mason . Mason tries to murder Grant by getting him drunk and putting him behind the wheel of a car . Later on Grant gets framed for murder while trying to find out what's going on and he's on the run from New York to Chicago to Rapid City and the Mount Rushmore monument . James Mason plays the cultured villain Philip Van Dam . Mr . Mason who had some of the most precise diction heard this side of Ronald Colman on screen , could play villain and hero and a lot in between equally well . Among other things he's a bi-sexual and his henchman / boyfriend Martin Landau is jealous of his involvement with Eva Marie Saint . With the Code still firmly in place , it was quite daring for Mason to refer to Landau's suspicions as his ' woman's intuition . Eva Marie Saint joins the list of cool and fiery blonds Hitchcock was so partial to for his films . I'm surprised he never used Eva Marie again , she seemed the perfect successor for Grace Kelly who if she hadn't become a princess would have been playing this part for sure . Bernard Herrman who wrote the acclaimed score for Hitchcock's Vertigo followed that up with an equally good score . Especially during the moments of Grant's tangle with a crop duster plane and the chase across the Mount Rushmore Monument , Herrman made great use of music to help the audience feel the tension . It's a great instrumental piece , violins that seem to pound with a drum counterpoint . The best kind of film music . And why wouldn't it be because North By Northwest is some of the best kind of film making .
393460	2483625	25316	10.0	The Hero As Comedian	In his autobiography , The Name's Above the Title , Frank Capra said that until It Happened One Night drama had four stock characters , the hero , the heroine , the comedian , and the villain . What Capra did and you might notice he followed that in a whole lot of his films , the characters of hero and comedian are combined . Not completely though because Claudette Colbert gets a few laughs herself , especially with that system all her own . But in doing what he did for Clark Gable's character , Capra created a whole new type of screen comedy , the classic screwball comedy and It Happened One Night surely set the mold . Capra's autobiography told the story of the making of It Happened One Night which in itself could be a movie . Capra worked for Columbia Pictures which at that time was a minor studio , along the lines of Republic or Monogram . As Capra tells it he had a vision about this story that Samuel Hopkins Adams wrote and persuaded Harry Cohn to buy it . Capra also had a stroke of good luck . Adolph Zukor at Paramount and Louis B . Mayer at MGM were looking to punish a couple of recalcitrant stars , Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable . The idea was to show these two what it was like to work in a small budget studio without all the perks of Paramount and MGM . In fact the description of Gable arriving to work at Columbia that first day , drunk as a skunk , is priceless . Capra dressed him down good and said that to his credit Gable came to work afterwards and couldn't have been more cooperative . At some point Harry Cohn at Columbia was convinced that maybe Capra had something . He had in fact delivered for Columbia the previous year with Lady for a Day . So the publicity drums were beat . The rest as they say is history . It Happened One Night won the first Oscar grand slam , Best Picture , Best Director , Best Actor , and Best Actress . It won the first Oscars Columbia Pictures ever got and lifted it right into the ranks of the major studios . And it set the standard for screwball comedy . The film could never have gotten off the ground were it not for the chemistry of Gable and Colbert . They're together for most of the film so if it doesn't click between the two of them , you have people walking out in droves . Colbert had already played a wide variety of parts at Paramount , ranging from Poppaea and Cleopatra to comedies with Maurice Chevalier like The Big Pond . Gable had played a whole lot of tough guys on both sides of the law at MGM . It Happened One Night showed he had some real comic talent , a flair MGM exploited in his roles from then on in . Gable and Colbert did only one other film together , Boom Town for MGM . You can't get much more different than those two films . Boom Town had a huge MGM budget , Spencer Tracy and Hedy Lamarr as well , and a lot of special effects involving the oil industry and hazards therein . It's also a great film , but it's not a classic like It Happened One Night .
395261	2483625	51459	10.0	" Maggie the Cat is Alive "	After a run of 694 performances on Broadway during the 1955-1956 season , Cat on a Hot Tin Roof made it to the big screen in 1958 , just in time for Elizabeth Taylor to get her second Best Actress nomination in two years . Unfortunately Liz was up against Susan Hayward for I Want to Live and nobody was beating Hayward out that year . But Elizabeth Taylor proved something . She was more than just an extraordinarily beautiful woman . That girl had real talent and she proved to be more than a box office name to insure business . In fact of the original Broadway cast only Burl Ives as Big Daddy and Madeleine Sherwood as his other daughter in law were retained for the film version . Paul Newman and Elizabeth Taylor replaced Ben Gazzara and Barbara Bel Geddes as the leads . Newman also got one of his early triumphs playing Brick Pollitt , the favored younger son of Big Daddy Pollitt . Brick's an aimless guy , still living out his dreams of glory from being a football player when he was younger . In fact in a drunken stupor he tried some athletic stuff at his former high school and got a broken leg for his troubles . Newman spends the entire film on crutches , with Ives berating him for being a 30 year old kid . The Pollitts are one dysfunctional family . They are awaiting the arrival home of the patriarch Burl Ives from a big name hospital and the news ain't good . Ives is dying and it's how the estate is to be divided that's his concern . Older son Jack Carson as Gooper with Sherwood has five kids with another on the way . A thoroughly obnoxious little group of ' no-neck monsters ' , but Southern families do like breeders . Brick on the other hand is making a big show of ignoring Elizabeth Taylor and no normal heterosexual male's going to do that for long . Obviously something is eating him , possible infidelity by Liz with his late football buddy Skipper . A whole lot of family skeletons get thrown from the closet before this film is over . Each one of the Pollitts is a deeply flawed human being as Tennessee Williams shows us . Burl Ives as actor was established in this role and in his role in The Big Country for which he got an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor . 1958 was that man's career year on screen . Big Daddy Pollitt is a man who worked his way up from nothing , concentrating so much on making a success he had no time for his family . And Paul Newman really is wonderful as a 30 year old kid who if he doesn't straighten out will soon be a 50 year old kid . It's a performance that really rings true for me because I was pretty aimless in my twenties before settling down to the job I held for 23 years before retiring . Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is one of the great pieces of 20th Century American literature . It has some universal lessons we could all profit by in viewing it .
395231	2483625	52002	10.0	When Audie Comes To Call	In No Name on the Bulllet , Audie Murphy got to star in one of the most unusual and best westerns in his career when he was cast in this off beat tale of a hired killer . As John Gant , Audie reverses type and becomes a coldblooded , yet very philosophical hired killer . His modus operandi is simple . He gets hired by someone to do someone else in and he goes to wherever his target is , baits him into a fight and then shoots him dead . It's pretty well known in the west that's how he operates . So Murphy arrives in a particular town , everyone knows he's there to see that someone dies . The town grows crazy with panic and speculation as to who his target might be . It's a nice original concept for a western and the credit has to go to scriptwriter Gene L . Coon who all Star Trek fans remember as the writer on the original series . Some of the townspeople are blacksmith R . G . Armstrong , doctor Charles Drake , banker Whit Bissell , mine owner Karl Swenson , judge Edgar Stehli , bartender Charles Watts , and store clerk Warren Stevens . Just who has Audie come to dispatch . All of these players fill out the roles of the panic stricken townspeople very well indeed . But it is Murphy's film and one of the best westerns ever done and I believe his personal best .
394225	2483625	59749	10.0	The Dirty Business of Espionage	The Spy Who Came In From the Cold is one of the few Richard Burton vehicles that he did without Elizabeth Taylor in the sixties . Some might argue it is the greatest film performance of his career and I'd be hard pressed to disagree . Taken from the John Le Carre novel , The Spy Who Came In From the Cold is a grim , realistic look at the world of espionage . No glamor , no gadgets involved , no derring-do to save the world , just people trying to acquire information illegally on both sides . The black and white photography in this film gives it a noir like quality and the performances are from a perfectly cast group of players . Headed of course by Richard Burton . He's a man over 20 years in the espionage game , but he knows no other life . Offered a desk job , he refuses and instead gets a dirty mission trying to bring down a crack East German intelligence agent . Burton when he gets the job uses true believer Communist Claire Bloom to gain entry as a defector to the Eastern bloc . Once in East Germany he cleverly plays off rivals in the Communist camp Oskar Werner and Peter Van Eyck against each other . Werner is of Jewish descent and Van Eyck is a former Nazi , so there's history between them that Burton cleverly exploits . Werner and Van Eyck are perfect in their roles . Richard Burton received another Oscar nomination for Best Actor , but lost to Lee Marvin for Cat Ballou . Cat Ballou is a funny film , but I don't think Marvin's performance in any way ranks over Burton in this . Of course Burton probably took consolation in the fact that Sir Laurence Oliver was up for Othello at the same time and he lost . One of the worst decisions ever made by Academy voters . The Code was getting a bit loose in this one and while there are no sex scenes , even in a film where part of Burton's mission was to seduce Claire Bloom . I guess this is the closest The Spy Who Came In From the Cold gets to James Bond . But one thing was also there and that was the performance of Michael Hordern as the explicitly gay man who makes contact with Burton as a supposed defector . Gay was almost invisible during the hey day of the Code and now gay characters were emerging on the screen . Claire Bloom's character is truly one of the most tragic ever put on the screen . It should serve as a warning to starry eyed idealists of the Left and how they can be exploited by their own people and those they are opposed to . In the years after Germany has been reunited , The Spy Who Came In From the Cold stands as a reminder of how dirty the Cold War could get .
395306	2483625	70735	10.0	Working The Big Con	The Sting , evoking a bygone era of gangsters and con men , was the deserved Best Picture of 1973 . The Sting won that Oscar plus a whole flock of technical awards . One award it didn't win was for Robert Redford as Best Actor . That must have been tough for the Academy voters because to single out Redford as opposed to Paul Newman must have felt a bit unjust . For though Newman was nominated many times over his career and finally did win for The Color of Money , did not get a nomination for The Sting . Robert Redford is a small time grifter who while working a bait and switch street con takes off a numbers runner carrying the weekly take . The orders come down from the head man himself , Irish-American gangster Robert Shaw to kill those who did this as an example . Redford's mentor , Robert Earl Jones , is in fact killed , mainly because Redford starts spending a lot of that newly acquired loot that tips them off . Redford wants revenge so he looks up big time con man Paul Newman who himself is dodging law enforcement as is Redford also . They work the big con on Shaw and it's a beauty . The scheme they have is something to behold . They also have to do a couple of improvisations on the fly that lend a few twists to the scheme . The costumes and sets really do evoke Chicago of the Thirties and director George Roy Hill assembles a great cast to support Newman and Redford . My favorite in the whole group is Charles Durning , who plays the brutally corrupt , but essentially dumb cop from Joliet who nearly gums up the works and has to be dealt with . Special mention should also go to Robert Shaw . He's got a difficult part , maybe the most difficult in the film . He's not stupid , he would not have gotten to the top of the rackets if he was . But he also has to show that hint of human weakness that Newman , Redford , and the whole mob they assemble that makes him vulnerable to the con . During the sixties and seventies Robert Shaw was really coming into his own as a player , getting more and more acclaim for his work . His early death was a real tragedy , there was so much more he could have been doing . Can't also forget another co-star in this film , the ragtime music of Scott Joplin that was used to score The Sting . It probably is what most people remember about The Sting . Music from the Theodore Roosevelt era , scoring a film set in the Franklin Roosevelt era made while Nixon was president . Strange , but it actually works . The Sting still works wonders today .
396919	2483625	50569	10.0	My first Sinatra film	When The Joker Is Wild first came out I saw it at the Nostrand Theatre in Brooklyn , New York . It was the best possible first exposure to Frank Sinatra . He is first rate in this biographical film about the life of Joe E . Lewis . Later on in his film career , Sinatra walked through a lot of roles , but not in this . This is a perfect blend of his persona being tailor made for the part . The supporting cast of Eddie Albert , Jeanne Crain , Mitzi Gaynor , Jackie Coogan , Beverly Garland are also well cast and give Frank excellent support . I have a bootleg copy of this movie , but hopefully Paramount will put this out one day . The song All the Way is interestingly used in the film . When Joe E . Lewis is a cabaret singer , Sinatra sings it and of course first rate . Later on after the mobsters try to cut his throat and damage his vocal cords , it's used in the background as a reminder of what he had lost . I don't know if the real Joe E . Lewis ever did any records from back in the twenties . I have heard him do some of his stand-up routines in that gravelly voice the gangsters left him with . Sinatra might have ruptured his own valuable vocal cords if he ever tried to really imitate Lewis . Still it's a marvelous performance . All the Way won the Oscar in 1957 for Best Original Song , it was the first time a Sinatra song was so honored . Frank was never in better voice and it remains to this day my favorite Sinatra record . Don't ever miss The Joker Is Wild when it's broadcast .
395431	2483625	120338	10.0	Maytime On The High Seas	Who says that old fashioned romantic films don't sell . They certainly do if they're done right as the story in Titanic certainly is . This blockbuster version of the most famous shipwreck in history is a homage to Maytime . In fact in casting Gloria Stuart as old Rose through whose eyes we see the disaster unfold , Director James Cameron went back to a contemporary of Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy . The film begins with the discovery of the wreck of the Titanic in the middle Eighties which did cause great excitement at the time . Searching the wreck divers come upon a safe and a nude portrait of a woman wearing a necklace with a diamond thought to be lost and the portrait is dated April 14 , 1912 . The woman is still alive and its Gloria Stuart who tells her tale the way an aged Jeanette MacDonald did in Maytime . Winning a card game that got him a third class passage aboard the maiden voyage of Titanic , itinerant artist Leonardo DiCaprio gets on board the vessel . He meets and woos a younger version of Gloria Stuart who is played by Kate Winslet . Unfortunately she's about to enter a loveless marriage for money urged on by her mother , Frances Fisher , who wants her declining years not be spent in the poorhouse . Her prospective fiancé is Billy Zane a rather arrogant young robber baron heir of his time who has a factotum / bodyguard in David Warner who has one of the best roles in the film . Still Leo and Kate get a few stolen hours of romance before the disaster strikes . One thing that James Cameron did is that he never allowed the spectacle of the disaster nor even the issues of wealth and class that were omnipresent in the Titanic story to overwhelm his romantic leads . In fact they are an integral part of the story as young Leo reaches for what was unobtainable . Leonardo DiCaprio remarked that his part of Jack was the least complex role he ever did . The part is a romantic lead , the guy has no secrets or hidden issues , he's just a young man in love . Maybe that was the reason he was not nominated for Best Actor in the face of all those nominations Titanic did get . It won for Best Picture and Best Director and a flock of Oscars in the technical area . Kate Winslet and Gloria Stuart were nominated and lost for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress respectively . Titanic is a story that's been filmed since the silent days almost in the wake of the disaster itself . The Germans made a propaganda film of it in 1943 which Nazi inspired though it was , did make a few points against the British upper classes and that the first class got saved and those in steerage mostly drowned . There was a fine version in 1953 with Clifton Webb and Barbara Stanwyck as an older married couple with problems on the doomed ship . And the British did the classic , A Night to Remember which is a documentary like recreation from the ship's officers point of view . Still they'll have to go some beat this one . Titanic is a film for lovers of all ages and run Maytime back to back with Titanic if you can get DVDs and / or VHSs of both films .
394629	2483625	912583	10.0	The Bible Tells Many Things	The sad thing about For The Bible Tells Me So is that the people who need to see this most are the ones who will be forbidden by their church to watch this very timely documentary . But for those who do get to see it they will be inspired and uplifted . As a gay 60 year old man who has lived in the last half of the last century I saw many marvelous changes at how Gay / Lesbian / Bisexual / Transgendered people have been viewed in American society and in the world at large . Growing up as I did in the fifties and sixties it would never occur to me to do something as courageous as young Jacob Reinert , not only coming out in Mankato , Minnesota , but bringing his parents into the fight for equality . For too many still gay is something where emotion kicks in and reason just flies out the door . Why is it so , religion and those few bible verses put down for an ancient tribe to make sure they multiplied and dominate , have become the touchstones to justify all kinds of hatred and bigotry . A distinguished group of religious scholars talk about how this came to be in western monotheist religions . There not names you know associated with Christianity or Judaism because there not on the air and in your pocket to stay on the air . They present quite a contrast with the bible thumpers where we see video going back as far as Billy Sunday . The man who comes in for the most scorn is James Dobson , pop psychologist and big kingpin on the religious right . Young Jacob Reinert attempts to confront him , but the most moving story in the film concerned Mary Ann Wallner who listened to Dobson's advice about rejecting her lesbian daughter who later kills herself . For The Bible Tells Me So makes it abundantly clear the political nature of the anti-gay religious right . GLBT people are the ' other ' the straw villains you create to justify why the populace should empower your crowd . As Hitler did to the Jews , so the religious right has done to us . My favorite moment in the film was when one of the scholars challenges these religious leaders to obey Jesus's commandment to sell all you have and give it to the poor and then you can follow him . Talk about selective Bible reading , can you see a Pat Robertson doing that ? It can never be forgotten that these folks place different emphasis on certain bible verses as opposed to others . My working life consisted in large degree of working at NYS Crime Victims Board as an openly gay investigator . I saw the most manifest examples of anti-gay hate , culminating in violence with serious injury and death . The religious right who keep talking about how our sin is so horrible are the ones who give justification to those who would do us bodily harm . I wish they could see their handiwork from where I sat for 23 years . For The Bible Tells Me So , is an excellent documentary that will hopefully win an Oscar in that category next year . And this review is dedicated to the young people from Soul Force I met and broke bread with in my city this past spring . As long as there are people like these confronting the hate and getting the message out , I have no worries about a movement or its ultimate success .
