436414	9938570	120458	1.0	The Scarecrow reviews " Virus "	Dreadful sci-fi / horror hybrid based on a comic book about an alien force which electrifies a Russian space station which in turn links to a Russian scientific research vessel down on the ocean of earth . A tug boat helmed by nut-case captain Sutherland ( in one of the worst performances of his career , battling an Irish accent and really lacking any presence whatsoever ) , with crew-members Curtis , Baldwyn , & the " ready - to - be - slaughtered - prime - time - players " suffer a cataclysmic leak on their boat after they try to pull a barge during a typhoon . They come across the Russian ship which seems to be deserted and ram-sacked and decide to salvage it with dollar signs glistening in their eyes for a big payday . The ship's power source is cut off and they do not not know what lies in wait once they re-power it . This film has nothing new to offer as characters are merely on script to be killed , completely lifeless and stupid . The alien force seems to operate anything mechanical and little robotic spiders and giant machine monsters run amok doing victims in . Curtis is too damn good in this film and it does not deserve her talents . Baldwyn does what he can with an underwritten hero simply written in the film to save people . . he doesn't even get to crack wise . Pacula portrays the only Russian survivor who tries to warn them of what they are up against . The film seems to be about explosions and more explosions . The evil electrical alien force doesn't even get much story . . it's simply in the film to kill , nothing more & nothing less . The force , for some reason , also assembles robots together using human remains along with wires and steel . Terrible mess which just gets worse and worse as it goes along .

Cassidy was the lead singer of a " demons and death " rock band who couldn't shake the sad feelings of her boyfriend's neglect towards her ( you know , I can find other reasonable ways to solve this other than putting a bullet through your head ) . She returns , however , possessing the soul of Dora ( Jill Small ) her friend who is to replace her on vocals so that the group can finish the album halted by Cassidy's untimely death . But , Cassidy made a deal with the dark one and souls are to be collected . . she's consumed by this anger towards mainly Neal , but all the band members or anyone within the music studio get dead when they fall prey to whom they believe is a rather distraught Dora . . not Cassidy returning for payback . Lousy micro-budget horror flick looks cheap , has a cheap cast who should make plans in another line of work , and boasts cheap kill-scenes which aren't effective one bit .
436866	9938570	96453	1.0	Witchcraft ( Evil Encounters )	Witchcraft / Witchery / La Casa 4 / and whatever else you wish to call it . How about . . Crud . A gathering of people at a Massachusetts island resort are besieged by the black magic powers of an evil witch killing each individual using cruel , torturous methods . Photographer Gary ( David Hasselhoff ) is taking pictures for Linda ( Catherine Hickland whose voice and demeanor resemble EE-YOR of the Winnie the Poo cartoon ) , a virgin studying witchcraft , on the island resort without permission . Rose Brooks ( Annie Ross , portraying an incredibly rude bitch ) is interested in perhaps purchasing the resort and , along with husband Freddie ( Robert Champagne , who is always ogling other women much younger than him ) , pregnant daughter Jane ( Linda Blair ) and grandson Tommy ( Michael Manchester , who just looks bored throughout , probably wanting to watch Sesame Street instead of starring in this rubbish ) , go by boat to the resort being treated to a look at the property by Realtor Tony Giordano's son Jerry ( Rick Farnsworth ) , obviously a pup in the business getting his feet wet . Along with these folks is architect Leslie ( Leslie Cumming , whose character is a nympho ) who might help Rose re-design the resort . The boat's captain is killed by The Lady in Black ( Hildegard Knef , wearing her make-up and lip-stick extra thick ) and a storm is brewing . The boat drives off by itself ( . . guided by the invisible power of The Lady in Black , I guess ) with everyone stuck in the decrepit resort , which is in dire need of repairs . Most of the victims , before meeting their grisly fates are carried through a type of red wormhole whose vortex leads to another dimension ( . . perhaps a type of hell or something ) where they are tortured by these fiends dressed in raggedy clothes with a crummy visage . One victim has her mouth sown before being hung upside down in a chimney , roasted as the others light the fireplace . One poor soul is tortured by harsh twistings of rope wrapped tightly around her flesh before being found hanging from the snout of a swordfish penetrating through her neck . One fellow is slowly suffocating as his veins bulge ( . . and bleed ) and neck's blood vessels burst squirting in Hasselhoff's face ! One fellow is crucified with nails hammered into his hands before being hung upside down over an open flame . Blair's pregnant victim becomes possessed with her hair standing on end speaking in another woman's voice . One is raped by this demonic man with a " diseased " mouth as the hellish hobos stand nearby gleefully cheering . The film , despite it's excesses , is mostly dull fodder for those who really wish to see the lowest point in the careers of Hasselhoff and Blair , who deserve better than this . Almost unbearable at times , building little-to-no suspense . Clumsy execution of the death sequences which look cheap and laughable . Sure some gore is okay , but most of the film shows victims after they've been run through the ringer . We do get a chance to see pregnant women ( . . who look exactly like stuntmen in costume with bad wigs ) jumping out three story windows . Oh , and The Lady in Black's reflected face often pops up on inanimate objects for characters to see . Tommy has a little Sesame Street recorder which tapes The Lady in Black's mumbo jumbo chants , obviously used for later . For some reason , The Lady in Black likes to visit little Tommy . He's not at all scared of her , for Tommy's just too bored to show any expression on his face , much less fear . Need I say more ? This one's a real stinker . Ugh .
435958	9938570	372832	2.0	Skeleton Man	A Delta Force Army unit , assigned to find a batch of missing Green Beret bad-asses not known for going completely missing , will be in a fight for survival against a cloaked skeleton man , the supposed spirit of an ancient Indian warrior who was revived when archaeologists disturbed his grave . The Skeleton Man rides a horse and has the ability to propel to and fro using a type of dimensional portal , and seems unaffected by bullet-fire and explosives . The Skeleton Man's horse leaves no hoof prints and he can ride from behind and around his prey silently . The film's point-of-view through the Skeleton Man's eyes looks at his prey with a different color . In other words , he's not seemingly human , so how can Captain Leary ( Michael Rooker , as grizzled and intense as ever ) and his gang of would-be commandos stop this menace ? For some reason , the Skeleton Man murders employees of a nearby chemical plant . What are the Skeleton Man's motives for slaughtering endless human beings ? And , why is a blind Indian living in the forest our commandos inhabit spared if the Skeleton Man , as a human , slaughtered his entire tribe to prove himself ? As completely stupid as it sounds . Just unbelievable horrible . This is the kind of film that can deaden brain cells . Casper Van Dien gets second billing in the credits just under Rooker , yet is saddled with a ridiculously underwritten character who exits the film quite early . Rooker deserves better than this . If I were an actor , I wouldn't want this movie in my resume . The Skeleton Man is a reject Templer Knight from a de Ossorio film . He has a spear which can merely knock certain people down while exploding the head of a woman on impact . An arrow shot from the Skeleton Man's bow actually destroys the propeller of a chopper plane . For nearly 99 % of the film , bullets are shot at the Skeleton Man and he can go in and out of that portal thingee yet , at the end , all of a sudden , he becomes vulnerable to attack . Oh , and the horses also change as the Skeleton Man freely moves through the forest from that portal . The film is written and edited by clowns . The attack scenes are poorly constructed and the characters , who are supposed to be experienced pros , make really bad decisions throughout this film . The mind boggles with this film . Good for some laughs , and some gore scenes make this hunk of pure crap watchable as a trash movie .
436675	9938570	85224	2.0	The Being	One eyed blob monster , a product of the usual toxic waste dumping ( . . as mayor José Ferrer put it so adequately , Pottsville was chosen by Industrial governmental scientist Martin Landau as " the most sophisticated dump site in the country . " ) , with slobbery sharp teeth and terribly sensitive to light , attack the locals by wrapping it's lizard tongue around their throats , whisking them out of the camera frame . Sheriff Bill Osco , who dresses like a truck driver , even when at the town station , is to the rescue , ready to kill the monster if he doesn't bore him to death first with his non-performance and monotone voice . The blob monster could very well be the son of a haggard Dorothy Malone . Meanwhile Mayor Ferrer's wife Ruth Buzzi is having Easter egg hunts with the children , holding rallies against the new massage parlor coming to town supposedly advocating an arrival of filth to the community , and holding an opera within her home for a gathering of town folk . Marianne Gordon , who seems to escape the embarrassment in a low-key performance as a waitress and possible love-interest to Osco ( . . why she'd even be interested in someone as lively as a block of wood is anyone's guess ) , will be the woman in peril who would eventually walk Malone home and never be seen in the film again . Now , to take a moment to talk about Landau . I think we can use " The Being " as an educational tool on how a prominent actor , at the very bottom of his career starring in this cinematic equivalent of a toilet bowl with fresh smelly turds , can rise from the ashes like a Phoenix thanks to two directors , Woody Allen ( . . in probably the finest performance of his career , " Crimes and Misdemeanors " ) & Tim Burton ( " Ed Wood " ) . I actually think Ferrer , last seen in this film driving off , quite wasted and frightened after seeing the blob monster , plays his role a bit tongue-in-cheek as a constantly annoyed Mayor who just wants to grow his potatoes and make his little town a wealthy place to earn a spot in Washington . Buzzi , is and always will be , Buzzi . . she is the busybody always organizing something , and is aggravating as ever . I imagine that those still populating drive-ins as this flick came out ( . . I'm guessing , temporarily ) probably cheered when Buzzi was on her way out of the picture . I think Dorothy Malone is a sex icon thanks to her work with Douglas Sirk , specifically her delicious nymphomaniac in " Written in the Wind " , but is handed a terribly thankless ( . . practically meaningless , if the script hadn't made her son the one effected by the toxic waste ) role in this steaming pile . On Jackie Kong's directorial decisions come a narrative voice at the opening after a radio DJ tells us about rain showers and thunderstorms moving into the area , prophetically announces doom to the little town of Pottsville , Idaho . She also gives us a run-down at what the surviving characters did with their lives after the incident at Pottsville is over . The climactic showdown between the hilarious monster and Osco should earn some good laughs . This hunk of excrement will probably work the best for fans of rancid schlock . I did find the drive-in sequence near the beginning pretty fun . . the movie playing equals " The Being " in quality which I find irony in . There's an attack scene where the monster , in gelatinous form , oozes from the air conditioning vents and radio to somehow kill a couple making out . It also puts an arm through a deputy holding his heart . Most victims , though , are pulled away by the thing . Best kill is probably the poor kid who tries to escape the monster getting his head removed .
435979	9938570	96118	2.0	Unhappy Campers . . Unhappy Movie-watcher	Absolutely putrid slasher film has not one redeeming quality . It has Camp Councellor Angela ( Pamela Anderson . . awful as the killer ; her quips when she wastes people aren't even amusing ) on the warpath slaying teenagers who act the least bit naughty or resist her pleadings for good behavior . We run the gamut of boring , clichéd killings such as the slashing to the throat to one kid looking for his Freddy clawed glove , a kid who gets a chainsaw , one girl who gets drilled , one who gets shoved into the crapper ( filled with leeches ) , one who is roasted , etc . It doesn't have one original idea to offer and is merely a waste of time . That is unless you want to see Valerie Hartmen's ( who plays the slut Ally ) tits . Most of the violence occurs off-screen so even that will not satisfy .
435692	9938570	93974	2.0	Silent Night , Deadly Night Part1 . . OOps , I mean part 2	Ricky ( Eric Freeman ) , the brother of Billy ( the killer from the first film ) is the psycho donning the Santa outfit . . well , for a moment or two . . this time , explaining to a psychiatrist what occurred to his brother years back . This screen time is merely a shameless excuse to save money while taking cash from paying customers who ventured in to see it . They practically show most of the first film and then we get thirty or so minutes of Ricky killing people . The most inventive kill comes when he attacks bookie with an umbrella that opens after being thrusted through the stomach . He provides us with little snippets of his past while chatting with the psychiatrist ( . . who stupidly insisted that a security guard wait outside the room . . this understanding that he's in the room with a man who shot numerous people for no reason whatsoever ) . We get a little understanding of a possible love-life with Elizabeth Kaitan's Jennifer . There's a confrontation with Jennifer's former boyfriend who has a smart-Aleck mouth and says the wrong thing which sets off Ricky's trigger leading to the use of jumper cables as a weapon ! The film has a truly sickening scene where Ricky goes on a shooting rampage down a suburban street killing as many innocent people as his gun allows him . Even more despicable than that is when Ricky attacks a wheel-chair bound , facially scarred nun with an ax . Eric Freeman is truly awful as the killer of the film . Even worse is how the film tries to turn this putrid slasher into a comedy . Dreadful trash .
435839	9938570	267440	2.0	Do You Wanna Know a Secret ?	Simply awful slasher , molded from the I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER type of fodder , has beautiful wealthy college students spending spring break in a Florida condo being murdered one by one . A misfire in every category imaginable from properly built suspense to the executed death sequences . . nothing is handled properly and the characters leave little more than caricatures you root to see decimated as quick as possible . Del Tenney ( The Curse of the Living Corpse ; I Eat Your Skin ) , of all people , executive produced , co-wrote , and stars as a priest in a pivotal role whose relationship to the killer I guess means something to why he's psychotic . The revelation of the killer is awkwardly handled and ineffective , probably not surprising a soul who watches it . There are a lot of attempted jump scares , with one character popping out to frighten their friend , which couldn't even manufacture a few cheap thrills , because they are so calculated in such a tepid way . Most of the attacks occur off-screen with bleeding throat cuts ( . . or pools ) representing the only real display of violence . The protracted finale , where the killer goes on and on with the actor desperately trying to make his villain as diabolical and demented as possible , is embarrassing and tense-less . There's not one single positive to derive from this clichéd and dull exercise with the pretty cast making little effort to rise past their one-dimensional roles . And , for pity sake , they could've at least allowed us to see Joey Lawrence get decapitated or something for withstanding the misery of sitting through this junk heap for 90 agonizing minutes . Dorie Barton , as the heroine final girl , Beth Morgan , who the killer seems to be obsessed with , couldn't be more vacuous and uninteresting ( . . oh , she was in rehab , and takes pills for her nightmares ; such intriguing exposition ) . Chad Allen , cast against type as a very intimidating " friend " of the group ( . . who happens to disappear from the film first , setting up the idea that he's the first victim ) , has a tough hill to climb with his role , so steep he eventually stumbles , rolling uncontrollably with no end in sight . Jeff Conaway , needing some cash I guess , has the beleaguered FBI agent role , whose daughter's murder motivates him to seek out the killer , leading him to Florida . Jack McGee has his usual a$$hole role as a smart-mouth Florida Police Chief who is often nose to nose with Conaway's agent . Oh , the answer to the title's question . . not really . Because once you get the answer , you will wonder why you bothered with this anyway .
435768	9938570	85701	3.0	The Hunger	If not for David Bowie's short but strong performance , some good aging make-up effects , three beautiful leads the camera adores , and a token lesbian sequence between major actresses you'd normally not see partaking in this sort of thing ( Scott's lone accomplishment in this film , because it's sure not the terrible editing job ) this hunk of smutty bile , director Scott would hope you'd find a stylish vampire tale , would be less of a discussed cult item . Scott tries to pass this thing off as an erotic European type of vampire horror cinema , but all the doves , windy see-through flowing curtains , and blood trickling in specific arty shapes down skin , can not salvage no content in story or plot . A terrible film . Oh , the synopsis , or lack there of . . a vampire femme , Miriam ( the lovely Catherine Deneuve who brings little depth to this character . . perhaps the script provided little chance to do so ) from Egypt with her pendant always hanging from the neck , watches as her chosen lover John ( David Bowie ) is beginning to rapidly age with no stop in sight . She wishes to put him away up stairs in a casket letting him realize that the whole " you'll live forever " has it's disadvantages . We also see that other caskets join him as she fondly speaks to each love personally . Her next conquest id Dr . Sarah Roberts ( Susan Sarandon ) whose field of study is immortality . . or slowing the aging process down using primates dying of a rare aging disease as guinea pigs . The film shows how Sarah succumbs to Miriam's cold advances ( one of many failures . . this supposed bond comes off unsuccessfully because Scott doesn't allow the plot to grow ; they meet and have sex without much room for small-talk ) and faces " the hunger " . . that yearning for blood that drives the vampire . Cliff De Young portrays Sarandon's lover and colleague at the government funded institute they work .
436106	9938570	47898	3.0	Bride of the Monster	A very sickly Bela Lugosi stars as Dr . Eric Vornoff , a scientist who wishes to make supermen so he can take over the world . He has a pet rubber octopus and massive lab assistant , Lobo ( Tor Johnson ) he whips when the mute beast doesn't obey his commands . News reporter Janet Lawton ( Loretta King ) pursues the reasons behind missing folks who were being either consumed by the octopus or treated to Vorkoff's failed experiments . She is soon captured by Vornoff who will attempt to use her as an experiment , but LObo takes a shine to her . Janet's fiancé , Lt Dick Craig ( Tony McCoy ) will be in hot pursuit , following his girlie's tracks eventually finding himself in the swampy lair of Vornoff . Capt Tom Robbins ( Harvey B Dunn ) will have to rescue not only a pesky reporter but his own detective as well . That's if his inept Keystone cops don't foul things up . Typically pathetic Ed Wood feature with cheap sets , laughable octopus with men unrealistically " captured " within it's tentacles which never move , Tor Johnson's " method acting " ( haha ) , amateurish acting , jokes and the cast's delivery which fall flat , an enormous stunt double who doesn't even remotely favor Lugosi fighting Lobo , gun shots which fire directly point-blank at Lobo yet never even cause him to flinch , dreadfully laughable brawl between Lobo and Craig ( . . and , especially Lobo and Lugosi's stuntman ) , and clumsily inserted scenes ( . . such as a lightning bolt exploding a house into flames , and a shot of Vornoff supposedly falling into the octopus ' pit , but one can clearly see that the victim captured was another character thrown in it's clutched earlier in the film ) . Lugosi's sincere portrayal is admirable despite how ravaged his body is of time and vice . His use of " hypnotic " hand ( . . something which many might find reminiscent to Lon Chaney from the silent age ) to put Janet to sleep is a bit embarrassing . I do think Wood was so proud of having Lugosi in his film as evident with the long scenes where his mad scientist exposes his dementia when confronted by those who threaten his work .
436857	9938570	80711	3.0	Fade to Black	Film nut Dennis Christopher fuses Hollywood fantasy into his mental framework and can not distinguish what is real as he kills an assortment of people who fracture his ego . Whether it be his boss or punk-bully Mickey Rourke , each die by one of his villain alter-egos ( such as Dracula , The Mummy , or Richard Windmark's lunatic gangster Tommy Udo from " Kiss of Death " ) until Christopher's Eric Binford is completely taken over by fantasy . Tim Thomerson is a police psychologist who wishes to help Eric before he gets himself or others killed . The Eric Binford character is overwhelmed with this passion for a Marilyn Monroe lookalike ( Linda Kerridge , who stunningly favors her quite a bit ) he believes is the real woman . He'll do whatever it takes to have his paramour . Terrible film had potential . The clips from classic old films selected and spliced within certain scenarios featuring Eric would've been a great idea if a better actor with greater depth played him . Christopher , following his success in " Breaking Away " , isn't up to the task and shows his character as erratic and unfocused . It's hard to watch him for one hour and 45 minutes as he overdoes his maniac scenes . He just doesn't have what it takes to draw you into his pathetic existence . Thomerson and Gwynne Gilford ( as Officer Anne Oshenbull ) have very underwritten roles as the ones trying to figure out how to get to Eric . . who is so far hidden within the madness of character personalities . James Luisi is Capt . Gallagher , a cop who sees Thomerson's type as a quack who merely gets in the way of real detectives . . although he's right about Eric . The film rather pursues the kind of possession Hollywood holds over those who love film too deeply . To partake in the experience of film to the point that it engulfs you separating you from the reality around you . If only a better actor could've been chosen as the lead ( and the film stayed on one course instead of going all over the place at times and not focusing enough on the police trying to stop Eric and his murderous ways ) the film might've had some potential .
436573	9938570	350061	4.0	Ripper 2 : Letter from Within	A group of deeply troubled teens take part in an experimental " humanizing " program once they are all sedated . It's a means of facing the horrid evil that plagues their delusional fantasies , using serial killer , Molly ( Erin Karpluk ) as the catalyst . The program seems to hinge on how Molly reacts to the virtual world created once they together are induced in a deep sleep . The terrifying element is that the evil inside Molly indeed separates and for the first time she is normal without the evil . But , the birthright and genes of being a descendant of Jack the Ripper wish to reunite with Molly and it is represented by a hulking figure covered with a giant Grim Reaper-esquire cloak . Each member who participated in the program are being annihilated by the evil manifestation within the dream state and when you are killed in this realm , you die in reality . Will Molly be able to deny the evil which wants to reconnect ? The doctor behind this project , with all it's flaws , is Samuel Wiesser ( Richard Bremmer ) who honestly believes he can remove what ills those who are not normal members of society . The flick basically rips off A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET with a cloaked Ripper in place of Freddy absent the goofy macabre wisecracks . The film is ambitious enough , but doesn't have the budget or smarts to hold together . The premise , though , comes off rather silly and confusing . It's not gory enough and the ending really only fuels the incoherency of the whole picture . The film is just too herky-jerky for it's own good . Does have atmosphere to spare , but that's pretty much it .
435883	9938570	122070	4.0	The Forest	A truly disturbed , cannibalistic psychopath , John ( Gary Kent , under the pseudonym Michael Brody ) who lives in a cave , stalks campers who make the unfortunate mistake of backpacking in his wilderness . Steve ( Dean Russell ) and his buddy Charlie ( John Batis ) get into a playful argument with their wives , Sharon ( Tomi Barrett , the late real-life wife of Gary Kent ) ) & Teddi ( Ann Wilkinson ) over surviving in the woods camping by themselves . To prove a point , the gals decide to head for the wilderness out of Los Angeles for a camping trip disturbing their partners to the point that they soon follow afterward . Falling prey to John , Teddi is soon killed as Sharon runs for her life as the men arrive late to the wilderness due to their truck's overheating . Afraid , tired , and paranoid , Sharon receives some very unusual assistance . . John's ghost children ! That's right , John's children remain in the wilderness , ghostly apparitions which spy on those who exist in the woods , taking a special liking to Sharon , helping guide her to safety and her friends . Meanwhile , Steve and Charlie soon find shelter from a down pour and the darkness of night in the very cave where John lives . Cooking over a burning fire , the meat simmering is actually from Charlie's wife , Teddi ! Unknowingly Charlie eats from the meat when offered by John who finds the outsiders inside his dwelling place ! Anyway , soon , worried about their wives , Steve and Charlie set out to find them as morning breaks . Meanwhile , John goes a hunting , with Charlie , Steve , and Sharon in a fight for survival . When Steve suffers a compound fracture stumbling between two massive rocks over a flowing river , he will be handicapped only increasing such an already nightmare scenario , with Sharon following her ghostly young friends to potential safety . . they even , at one point , plead with their father to not kill her . Charlie , unfortunately , doesn't have such friends . Director Donald Jones ( . . who also wrote it and went broke funding the film ) smartly shoots the film in such a breathtaking , gorgeous location in the Sequoia National Park , in California , where those gargantuan trees tower to great heights , and I basically watch backwoods slashers for this very purpose . For some strange reason , I didn't particularly find Jones ' direction of the setting very atmospheric . . the dread was missing , although there are some rather disturbing attacks by John using his knife ( . . shot in a clever way , Jones ' camera suggests more than what is actually on screen , yet , somehow , still achieves that gasp at what John is doing to victims ) . Within such a picturesque landscape , to see innocents preyed upon by a maniac , that kind of increases the terror . City folk attempting to spend a nice few days in a different place , to smell the clean , fresh air , enjoy the sights of a lovely view , only to find themselves stalked by a creepy predator with a very intimidating knife . Providing the back-story to why John is the monster he is , Jones allows us to witness his memory flashback in discovering his wife's adultery and reacting accordingly ( . . she is also a ghost in the wilderness looking for her children , wishing to punish them for " being naughty " ) killing both her and the lover in bed ( . . a refrigerator repairman ) . The children , sad and depressed committed suicide and now " haunt " the wilderness , still interacting with their pa or whoever they so choose . I realize such a novelty as ghost children in a backwoods slasher is unique and appreciated by some , but I found the idea rather hokey and too silly to take serious . They do help our heroine escape a few potentially dangerous situations , but it was awfully hard for me to keep from giggling uncontrollably . The music I found hideously 80's and the performances aren't mind-blowing . I mean I could react to the situation they were in , because it is indeed quite terrifying to find yourselves in an unfamiliar and hostile territory being hunted by someone who knows the area so well . I think the film is similar in many ways to DON'T GO INTO THE WOODS . . ALONE ! , except that THE FOREST has the aforementioned ghost children ( . . their voices echo when talking to Sharon , their father , or each other ) . Gary Kent looks like a filthy George Lucas , with tattered clothes , and humanity lost . As I mentioned above , the violence isn't as grisly as what is suggested because director Jones is able to effectively cut away from a great deal of knife penetration , yet the way he stages the set pieces leave you rather unsettled ( . . such as Teddi's murder , the violence mostly silhouetted on the surface of a nearby huge stone formation , her pleas for John to stop and , once stabbed several times , attempts to crawl away from her predator only to be finished off ; a hanging corpse John is skinning ) . I've seen better and worse of this type of slasher film , it's rather mediocre , at best , with some effectively shot scenery . I don't really think it's particularly memorable , for the exception of the ghost children .
436736	9938570	1229820	4.0	Buried Alive	Yet another independent horror flick ( . . based on a series , I have just discovered ) modeled after the likes of SAW & THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT has old high school friends , once party to ridiculing a kid named Tommy , attacked by a young man with a crow bar , his face masked , with them awakening to find themselves each trapped within a coffin rigged with little clues leading to why they are in their present situation . The film unequivocally paints a portrait towards Tommy , so it's obvious he's not the person responsible , but during the development of the plot , another candidate arises , an auto mechanic whose relations with two key characters adds dimension to the proceedings . The film isn't all that violent , and spends a great deal of time showing the scared victims scrambling for a way out and answers as to why they are in this predicament . Clippings from past recordings also play a heavy role in the developing plot as well . A lot of the time Brit Morgan ( Mel ) talks directly to the camera musing to her web blog about her perilous situation . VERY limited budget shows and the plight of the characters might provide unintentional chuckles thanks to their kooky environs and rather lame death sequences . An annoyance for me personally were the jumps and jerks of the camera screen as if something were wrong with the equipment or some sort of tape malfunction . I guess this was an artistic decision to show how the whole operation was put together in a raw sort of way by someone with limited experience in kidnapping and torturing folks , creating with the materials available to him . Tommy ( Augusto Aguilar ) is a smallish , quiet and timid fellow , who is considered creepy by his peers maybe because he wears black , has long hair and walks with his face often to the ground . Rick ( Bram Hoover ) is the attractive , wealthy and obnoxious bully , known for dating multiple girls , who mistreats Tommy . Tommy is in love with Rick's girlfriend , Becca ( Greyson Chadwick , Dance of the Dead ) and attempts to express his feelings . Travis ( Jeff Blum ) is the film's main cameraman , often following the occurrences surrounding Tommy and his mistreatment at the hands of Rick and others , such as Curtis ( JR May ) , Sage ( Nikki McKenzie ) & Wylie ( Natalie Wachen ) . The film's constant is the killer's various cameras recording the trapped victims , inside their homemade coffins , dying in constructed ways . Wylie is trapped in a coffin with pipes that send water . Rick's coffin is rigged with electrical cords . Curtis needs a specific pill and food or else he will go into shock with help on the opposite side of a glass window ( . . the kicker for this is that a mound of earth awaits such a decision ) . Meanwhile , Sage's " girlfriend " , Melanie ( Brit Morgan ) and brother Travis ( . . the cameraman who was friends with Rick and the others , often even associating with Tommy ; when he wasn't supporting those who ridiculed him by taping the shenanigans ) are following text messages sent to her by the supposed mastermind behind the coffins and secret networking feeding both pursuer and kidnapped . This film often retreats to various cam-corder recordings leading up to the situation at hand with a determined , and rather manic , Mel pursuing any possible information her snooping can provide with Travis a nervous , reluctant tag-along who wishes she would calm herself instead of working into a frenzy . And , the possible danger that might await her seems to be a guiding reasoning behind Travis ' pleas for her to back off the pursuit , particularly when she focuses her intent of auto mechanic Hayden ( John Charles Meyer ) . Hayden's possible guilt grows as she finds out certain things about him throughout her nosing into his personal affairs . Everything , however , revolves around Becca . She's trapped within a box containing pink bubblewrap and is treated with better conditions than her fellow friends / prisoners . And , certain revelations regarding Becca come to light as the film continues . The mastermind behind the whole operation shouldn't surprise many people .

A chain reaction of new vampires ignites when those unaware , such as Rakeem ( Delpano Wils ) , his sister Tisha ( Kobina Wright ) and his other friends who show up at the slumlord's house to cause a ruckus due to the death of a young child thanks to a fire . That fire was indeed in the slumlord's building and Rakeem wants retribution , but instead finds himself in a pretty scary situation . . the slumlord's family are out to get their blood . Jen ( Janet Martin ) seems to be the only member bitten who can control the evil raging . . at least enough to assist Rakeem in his goal to kill as many vampires as he can . But , the main goal is killing the slumlord who seems to be in control of the carnage that has emerged . We get a glimpse of how bad the vampire plague has spread through the scurrying shadows that often pass the houses outside . . there seems to be no hope in Rakeem and Jen's cause to end the vampire disease that's spreading quickly and endlessly . Gory micro-budget flick from director Desi Scarpone suffers from unoriginality . He really brings on the vampire feeding and never holds back on the bloodletting . When he focuses on the violence , it's quite effective . It's the other problems that surface such as a plot that really has nowhere to go . It's basically an endless supply of vampire attacks and one-liners from those infected who praise being inflicted with their disease for they say it has changed them for the better . The black characters represented here are mostly gangster stereotypes or those very nervy about being in a suburban white neighborhood . There is an obvious array of profanity and irrational behavior as if they can't think for themselves and are clueless as to how to get out of their situation . Rakeem is really the only fully developed character of the bunch , but Wils doesn't have the kind of talent to bring life to him . The film , interesting enough , mostly has females doing the biting and such . That alone makes this an interesting little watch regarding vampire mania . But , it follows the basic vampire formula and the single location of one of two suburban homes really stifles the ambition of where Scarone wishes to take his film .
436349	9938570	437179	4.0	See No Evil	Pro wrestler Kane stars as Jacob Goodnight , a humongous psychopath , who was the victim of a nasty religious fanatical mother during childhood ( . . we see in his recollecting memories , as a child being locked in an animal cage as a result of looking at dirty mags ) , venting his anger on a group of correctional kids from male and female facilities , hoping to remove a year from their various prison sentences by cleaning up a dilapidated old hotel , reeking of rats , roaches , rust , and garbage . Goodnight knows all the rumoured secret passages throughout the hotel and spies on the kids and their guardians , a cop who shot the psycho in the head four years previous after losing his arm by an ax chop , and the female corrections officer , contemplating a marriage proposal . Over an extended night of horror the characters will meet their gruesome fates one by one as Goodnight removes their eyes from the sockets , placing them in jars of water . One female , though , Kira ( Samantha Noble ) is spared from being killed because she has a large tattoo of a cross marking down her back . In his previous murderous rampage , a young woman was also spared because she had a cross tattoo . . although her eyes were removed . In order for any of the kids to survive , they must work together to stop Goodnight who wields a mean axe and often whips a chained hook which catches his prey from quite a length . The hotel has penthouse floors gutted by fire from long ago which killed the owner of the hotel and his wife and sent the place into ruin . Hobos made the hotel their home , before meeting Goodnight sealing their fates . . this is why you'll see numerous dead homeless folks lying all over the place . There's also a hidden room rumoured to carry a safe holding the former hotel owners private holdings in a safe . Standard slasher fare has plenty of ultra-violence to feed the gorehounds . One rich bitch , put in prison for shoplifting , meets her end as Goodnight finds a unique way of shutting her up through a ringing cell phone . Goodnight often likes to lift his victims in the air , clutching their throats with his monstrous grip , slamming them against walls . One victim is hoisted in the air with her head crushing the ceiling of an elevator leaving part of her scalp . Another receives the chained hook thrusted into his throat . Another victim receives the shock of a taser in his throat and safe which crushes his ribs . In a sense of grim irony , one girl , sent to prison for an act to save animals , meets her end by the ones she cares deeply for . I think Kane is an ideal psycho and meets the requirements of hulking monster who really looks the part as he stalks his prey . And , the setting really works as the characters run for their lives trying to outsmart their adversary any way they can . But , director Gregory Dark is like a kid with a brand new toy as his camera speeds up while often shaking obnoxiously , with the lens either shuttering or at different angles . There are quick cuts which break the action that I found rather tiresome , to be honest . I felt Dark really wanted to bring a specific style to this film so that he could make up for it's rather derivative premise . But , Dark's film is a run-of-the-mill slasher and no matter what he tries to do with his camera ( . . and through the editing process ) , he can not mask what SEE NO EVIL is . I'm sure this will satisfy those blood-thirsty slasher fans who merely want death and carnage . Speaking for myself , I'll probably forget it by tomorrow . Oh , and the characters couldn't die fast enough , and what is funny about this film is that the most loathsome character , a real cruel prick named Michael ( Luke Pegler ) , becomes the savior for the chosen " final girls " of the screenplay . Go figure . Goodnight's fate is pretty neat , though . . and what a dog does as it urinates , breaking the closing credits for a moment , is grotesquely amusing .
436554	9938570	67487	4.0	The Night Evelyn . .	Lord Alan Cunningham ( Antonio De Teffè ) is a nutjob { seen early on trying to escape an insane asylum } , with this castle slowly succumbing to ruin , likes to kill various hookers who resemble his deceased wife Evelyn , a woman who betrayed him for another man , with those red locks . This nutcase is quite wealthy and his bachelor status can be quite alluring . He , however , is overrun by his obsession with his late wife's memory ( specifically her adultery . . he saw her naked with the lover ) . While the memory of Evelyn is almost devouring his whole existence , Alan tries his best to find true love and believes he has with Gladys ( Marina Malfatti , who spends most of the film naked . . that's probably her lone attribute since she isn't a very good actress ) , who agrees to marry him after a very short courtship which should probably throw up flags right away { there's a key moment of dialogue where she knows exactly to the very amount what he is worth } . The only real person Alan can confide in is his doctor from the hospital , Dr . Richard Timberlane ( Giacomo Rossi-Stuart ) . There are other key characters in this film that revolve around Alan . Alan's cousin , George ( Rod Murdock ) , seems to be quite a good friend who often supplies him victims . . I mean dates , while holding onto hope of getting his lord's estate some day . Albert ( Roberto Maldera ) , Evelyn's brother , is a witness to Alan's slaughter and , instead of turning him into the police , squeezes him for cash . Aunt Agatha ( Joan C Davis ) , wheelchair bound , lives at the castle estate and is often seen snooping around behind cracked doors . We later find that she is having a love affair with Albert . All that is described above services the rest of the story which shows what appears to be the ghost of Evelyn haunting Alan , someone is killing off members of the cast family that revolve around Alan , and the body of Evelyn is indeed missing . The ultimate question is who is committing the crimes after Alan and Gladys are married , where is Evelyn's body , and will Alan go over the edge ? I have to be honest and say I just didn't really care much for this film . It's badly uneven and the pacing is all over the place . It looks great on the new DVD and the " rising from the grave sequence " is cool , but what really hurts the film in my mind is that the entire cast is unlikable . You really have a hard time caring for Alan because he is a psychotic who is skating on thin ice in regards to holding his sanity . He can be quite volatile . Who commits the crime really isn't that great a surprise for after several key characters are murdered off , there aren't but a choice few who could be doing it . What happens to Alan doesn't really make your throat gulp because you can make the argument he's just getting what he deserves . Those behind the whole scheme of the film in regards to Alan , as I pointed out before , aren't that shocking because if you are just slightly aware of certain circumstances ( . . or advantages they'd have ) that would benefit them with the collapse of Alan's sanity , then everything just comes off less than stellar . I thought the editing was choppy and unexciting , but the acting from the entire cast is really below par . Some stylistics help and there is a sniff of Gothic atmosphere in the graveyard sequences to help it some .
436591	9938570	92744	4.0	The Scarecrow reviews " Bloody Pom Poms "	Getting it out right now , this film is completely lame . . and basks in it's absurdity . The film follows the same line of many " Friday The 13th " type of psychos picking off scantily clad teens , but it just wallows gleefully in it's cheesiness the film is hard not to enjoy a little bit . You have the prototypical heavy kid who is ripe for exploiting himself { aren't fat people supposed to always be the butt of jokes in the Anti-PC 80's ? } with getting his butt stuck in a window as he is flashing people ( I couldn't help it . . I giggled uncontrollably ) , dresses as a woman while spying on chicks showing their tits , and gets his stomach ripped open with guts splattering out . Betsy Russell plays a young teen with hideously , tiresomely goofy nightmares whose boyfriend is Leif Garrett { in the " how far my life has sunk " role often welcomed by once " prominent " stars } . Lucinda Dickey plays Betsy's " pal " and Lorie Griffen { the babe in " Teen Wolf " who is the stuck up snob we all know and love } plays a goofy , but lovable ditz . The film embellishes silly characterizations , but has an " I don't care " attitude that one might admire . There are some violent deaths , but most of the gore is shown not seen in the actual moment . It is not a good film , but it could probably fill the craving for a cheesy 80's horror item if one is looking for it .
435996	9938570	185976	4.0	Carnage	Andy Milligan schlockfest concerning newlyweds and their pals terrorized by the restless spirit of a murdered bride who wishes for those who occupy her humble abode to leave . This very disturbed ghost bride causes objects of all sorts to move , harm , and kill those who are in , or around , the home for which her husband blew her brains out before turning the gun on himself . Whether it be the newly hired maid or a pair of burglars who just so happen to pick the wrong house to attempt to rob , the bride will frighten and destroy you with whatever weapon might be at her disposal . Michael Chiodo and Leslie Den Dooven are the newlywed couple , The Hendersons , who fail to leave despite the weird goings-on ( . . such as a phonograph which plays the melody of " Here Comes the Bride . . " over and over or home appliances and tea cups continuously moved around when their backs are turned ) and this decision to stay , including a housewarming which leads to a friend slipping on a rug moved by the apparition with broken glass landing into her skin , opening a very bloody wound , and another pal taking a bath when a radio is thrown into the water electrocuting him , will yield repercussions . Like The Amityville Horror , The Hendersons , against obvious signs that something supernatural is present , remain while most of us would get a clue and head out of Dodge . Will The Hendersons be able to survive inside this haunted house or leave while the going's good ? Following the footsteps of Ed Wood , Al Adamson , and Hershell Gordon Lewis , Andy Milligan lends his support to the bad movie movement , writing , photographing and directing ( . . maybe he even catered for all we know ) this flat , snail-paced , poorly performed disaster with hokey gore and poltergeist effects . A supposedly decapitated hand literally falls out of a shirt sleeve . You can tell that strings are pulling the objects which are supposed to move by themselves . The terror scenes which feature the ghost bride ( . . whose eyes are completely white , featuring blood on her wedding gown ) popping up to freak out her victims are embarrassingly corny ( . . particularly the attack on the maid ) . As a horror film , this doesn't work at all , but as a comedy , unintentional or not ( . . I had a feeling , Milligan features quite a bit of intentional comedic haunt bits throughout , in particular the pranks the bride pulls on The Hendersons , hiding a notepad or hanging up a phone when a person was on the opposite line ; even the scene where the bathing victim is electrocuted , he's singing to polka music from the very radio which ultimately kills him ! ) it often entertains . Milligan's cast resemble amateur actors who probably made appearances in a local theater or were friends of his . The practical effects often feature poor make-up , where the wounds are , with squirting blood . The film features amusing dialogue between characters conversing about trivial matters . There are conversations between a secondary character and her psychiatrist mom ( . . about a deteriorating marriage , and upcoming pregnancy ) which has little to do with the major storyline . . . the relationship problems between Walter ( John Garrit ) and Susan ( Deeann Veeder ) which they share with moms takes up large portions of the film , probably servicing the film as filler , before they accept the dreaded housewarming invite from The Hendersons . I did particularly enjoy the banter between Carol's father and his meddlesome maid , Martha , who calls to her attention that the house might be haunted , with pops telling her to quit talking such nonsense . . how aggrevated they are with each other . The film does feature melodrama which brings a rather surreal awkwardness when the graphic violence occurs . . it was as if Milligan was attempting to make two films , and neither is very good ! The characters featured in this film reminded me of those kooky relatives you love but often wish to avoid . The editing during the supernatural attacks will probably either induce groaning , pity , or laughter . Possibly features the worst decapitation ever produced and the flying hatchet which targets a priest ( . . not to mention the whole sequence where the spirits of Ann and Mark Webb cause a maelstrom with intent to harm the priest ) will elicit certain chuckles . The scene where another robber is stuck in the throat with a pitchfork , containing a horribly executed " guts removal " will also tickle the funny bone of many . The ending , where the Webbs wish for The Hendersons to remain , provoking a possible " reinactment " of their demise , doesn't really make a hell of a lot of sense .
436135	9938570	95740	5.0	Welcome to Spring Break	" Welcome to Spring Break . . the annual migration of the idiot . " A maniac in a biker suit and helmet is randomly murdering college kids visiting Manatee Beach on their Spring Break . Questioning whether or not the murders are being committed by a recently executed biker gang member , Diablo , the mayor ( Fred Buck ) wishes to cover them up and hopes that corrupt cop Strycher ( John Saxon , playing a mean , brutish thug with an ugly backstory that surfaces for the viewer when our protagonists search his trailer ) and Doctor Willet ( Tarantino regular Michael Parks ) can keep the crimes hush-hush . But , as the death toll mounts with most of the murders committed with the use of electricity , this task will become nearly impossible to prevent . The film follows a depressed college quarterback , Skip ( Nicolas De Toth ) , who threw an interception which cost his football team the National Championship , searching for his murdered wide-receiver pal and joining forces with bartender Gail ( Sarah Buxton ) whose sister was supposedly murdered by Diablo ( . . she was there when he was fried in the electric chair , which is why many of the future victims are executed with the use of such methods as shocking bolts burning flesh ) . As a team , who are falling in love , they will seek out who killed his friend , discovering that perhaps her sister was not murdered by Diablo , but by somebody else . Making their search difficult is Strycher who wishes to keep his corruption hidden , threatening to kill Skip if he doesn't leave the county . Meanwhile Reverend Bates ( . . deep-voiced Lance LeGault , always looking angelic and sincere ) continues without fail to convince his daughter , who has been partying with the visiting " sinners " , to return to church and joining him in prayer for her " lost soul . " Bates was also there at the execution reading Diablo's last rites , and offers the idea aloud that he may've returned from the grave to seek revenge against those responsible for framing him for a murder he didn't commit . With Diablo's body missing from his grave , Strycher will make the lives of an unruly biker gang , The Demons ( . . for whom Diablo was leader ) , miserable , believing they are maybe responsible for the removal . But , the bikers have a special plan for him . Skip also has run-ins with the bikers for his dead comrade had a series of altercations with them . Umberto Lenzi's slasher flick features the excess of the 80's . Big hair . Loud rock music . Wet T-shirt contests . Bikini-clad babes . Horny males seeking sex . Over-the-top murders including several young women dying horribly from electrocution ( . . the effects which are rubber masks being burned , leave anything to be desired ) . A very attractive tourist prostituting out of her hotel room using a series of disguises ( . . mostly a student of some sort needing cash so that she can help the poor and needy ) as a peeping tom ( . . the manager of the hotel ) watches from a carved hole in a supply closet . At first , you might ponder why the leather-clad psycho , if it were Diablo , would murder such unrelated victims , many of them just in the wrong place at the wrong time . But , like in a lot of these slashers , the unlikely candidate is the one responsible . It would make sense that the one responsible could commit such acts if motivated enough . Lenzi never wavers when it comes to showing the beach party atmosphere of kids enjoying their perverse thrills . The acting in this film will make your eyes and ears bleed , but Saxon almost rescues this with his evil cop routine , always a threat and causing friction with our protagonists and about everyone else in the story . The violence rarely is logical and the methods of electrocution ( . . using cut wires ) are embarrassingly lame and ridiculous . There's even one murder using rising flame from a furnace which is simply laughable , but also effective when we see a burnt skull after the fire goes down . There's moments where Lenzi wishes to inject humor with a practical joker always pulling " death stunts " whose fate is an ironic twist . And , we spend moments with a thief who successfully lifts wallets from female beach babes who trust him . This kind of film will be embraced by those who have a love and appreciation for bad direction , script , acting , and gore-effects . And , I think those who have a love for those times of 80's excess as college kids live it up on the beach , will enjoy this as well . Others , beware !
435706	9938570	1029234	5.0	Martyrs	I'm pretty sure a film like MARTYRS is sure to polarize a large majority who finds the actions of this secret society desiring to know without doubt that there's an afterlife to an extent that a chosen victim will serve as a martyr to prove so , rather appalling and disturbing . I have read many find the ending ( . . what the martyr " sees " and the actions of the mastermind behind the project who is told " the answer " so sought after ) rather disappointing , certainly there's a negative vibe I have derived from what ultimately transpires , but I found it so sick and daring that all I could do was laugh . Quite an odd reaction after watching some poor girl tortured for 30 long minutes , just so that elderly wealthy types could learn of the truth behind what lies " on the other side " , but I just couldn't help but bury my face in my hands and laugh . The film is just brutal almost from start to finish without little time to breathe or sigh , just violence heaped upon violence . Director Pascal Laugier ( House of Voices ) establishes right from the get-go that the film would feature victims abused , and the results of such horrors . Mylène Jampanoï , in an astonishing , heartbreaking performance is Lucie , a young woman who massacres an entire family with a shot gun . At first , you believe she's bonkers , but we soon realize that the parents killed weren't whom they appear . . far , far worse . But , Lucie hallucinates , believing that a mistreated victim she didn't rescue as a child after escaping from a place of torture is always coming for her . Along with Lucie is her friend from an orphanage , Anna ( Morjana Alaoui , also delivered a terrific , haunting performance ) who witnesses the aftermath of the slaughter , attempting to clean up the mess , while mortified at such a grisly crime scene . Later , though , after Lucie makes a tragic decision due to a complete psychological breakdown , Anna discovers a secret area hidden , containing a torture chamber with a chained and badly ravaged victim , bound by shackles , her eyes covered by a steel plate hammered into her skull ! Anna removes the poor woman from the prison . attempting to help her . But , the woman finds a large knife , tearing away at her wrist until shot through the forehead . This is when Anna meets those responsible for what has traumatized her friend Lucie . An organization , ran by a woman referred to as Mademoiselle ( Catherine Bégin ) , wishes to uncover the age-old mystery desired down through the ages by those with religious doubt . . is there an afterlife and is there a way at discovering such a truth . Using an unwilling participant as their martyr , Anna could be their link to the truth . So she's brutalized for the remainder of the movie , nearly practically dead when she does experience something ( . . we are led to believe ) . . could she provide an answer they so desperately covet ? I warn those who take the leap and rent this film because it's incredibly violent . Lucie blows crater-sized holes into the bodies of an entire family obviously leaving you breathless before the thing she sees even enters the picture . That created being is scary as hell and you can understand why poor Lucie is so tormented . Then , you are shown a horrifying discovery and witness a person whose been kept in the dark , her skin cut throughout the body , knees practically broken , little sanity left remaining . Then , after all that , you have to sit through what these cretins do to Anna . Each chapter goes one step further . The one who got away . The one almost dead . And , Anna , the one they may finally have to provide the answer they seek . This is NOT for the faint of heart . What ultimately happens to Anna left me rather unnerved , I must admit , and the experience we witness through " her eyes " couldn't impact me because I was so shaken by the damage she had suffered . I can't say I was entertained by this one , and , truth be told , I felt very little after it was over . To be honest , I was glad once it was over because I just grew tired of seeing Anna pummeled and left to rot before the final despicable act was completed towards her person .
436436	9938570	61411	5.0	The Blood Beast Terror	Peter Cushing stars as Inspector Quennell , a detective trying to uncover who it is murdering folks in his jurisdiction . Scales are left at the crime scene and the victims all suffered nasty lacerations where teeth had been gnawing , draining their blood , eating their flesh . Robert Flemyng is a mad genius , an expert in entomology and a geneticist who has somehow created a giant Deaths-head moth , who masks itself as a beautiful woman , Clare ( Wanda Ventham ) , pretending to be his daughter , luring young men with her feminine wiles before returning to insect form and attacking them . While I didn't feel it was as horrible as many feel it is ( . . including Cushing , from what I've read ) , this creature feature doesn't even try to thrill the viewer with any surprises , instead director Sewel and writer Peter Bryan fashion this after many a monster movie . You have the detective searching for the causes behind grisly ( . . though , unseen ) murders . We see the mastermind behind how the monster was created . We see how the unmasked monster operates . We see how the mastermind's own creation causes enough problems with her feeding habits that he must hit the road with the detective in steady pursuit soon making the startling discovery that a giant killer moth is doing in innocent men . Creature turns on creator . Creature's weakness for blood / flesh does her in eventually . Of course , this film provides Cushing's inspector with a cute daughter , Meg ( Vanessa Howard ) , who will find herself in possible danger . Her potential boyfriend , William ( David Griffin ) , a bug catcher will also face certain peril due to his killing a deaths-head moth for his collection . The film features lovely countryside setting with beautiful flowers of a variety of colors and shows how vindictive and cunning Clare is at spotting males , and maneuvering them away from the eyes of possible witnesses . This is no world-beater , but it's an adequate time-waster . I've seen much worse , but Cushing doesn't look very comfortable or inspired in this role , which is a very rare case in such a storied career . Roy Hudd , as a mortician , is a hoot always eating ( . . and offering snacks to Inspector Quennell and Sergeant Allan , played by Glynn Edwards when they are reviewing the bodies of victims ) and grinning wide , cracking wise and often irritating his guests . The killer moth is basically a bug costumed stunt-person .
436423	9938570	78235	5.0	Last House on the Beach	Franco Prosperi directs yet another exploitation flick inspired by Craven's notorious Last House on the Left , this time a trio of bank robbing hoods ( led by Ray Lovelock , Let Sleeping Corpses Lie ) besiege a group of Catholic teenage students and their Nun supervisor , setting off a reign of terror over the course of three nightmarish days . Sister Christina ( Florinda Bolkan , Don't Torture a Duckling ) tries without fail to rescue her girls from constant harm , sexual molestation and degradation , even suffering depraved persecution herself . The three hoodlums , pretty-boy Aldo ( Lovelock ) and his unhinged co-horts Walter ( Flavio Andeini ) and Nino ( Stefano Cedrati ) , often resort to diabolical acts mistreating the girls , and Christina , making extra efforts to humiliate and frighten their weaker prey . The girls watch as Christina's clothes are ripped away by Walter , forced to put on her nun outfit for their amusement . One of the girls , chosen by Walter as a victim of constant abuse , is held down as Nino penetrates her from behind , with their sole purpose being to " pop her cherry . " It's even shot in slow motion for extra impact as Aldo holds Christina in a position where she's forced to watch without the ability to turn away . When one of the girls is almost raped by Nino , she stabs him in the leg with a comb , later caught after almost escaping by Aldo , and penetrated with a large sharpened stick by the very one who almost sexually molested her . Aldo spends a great deal of time setting himself up as an innocent among two depraved monsters , but he's even worse than they , with his true self really awakening at the end when the girls revolt out of outrage for their captors ' behavior . Thankfully , director Prosperi doesn't actually elaborate the evil actions of the cretins in vivid detail , finding ways to shoot around the explicit acts such as the vaginal violence which leads to the victim's death , or the maid who is bashed across the head by an iron when Walter becomes enraged for no reason whatsoever . The film works off the idea that we will be impacted by who the chosen victims are , teenage girls and their nun . The hoods are your typical scumbags , relishing their activities watching the victims squirm in fear , taking full advantage of them . They are cowards with big weapons who cause harm to those who supposedly pose no threat which always builds up the violent climax where the innocents develop a primal nature , getting even with the ones who caused them such harm . Nothing really special about this umpteenth Italian terror film except the fabulous location on a fine piece of property overlooking a beach with a typically fine performance from Bolkan who plays it completely subtle , using her eyes as a means for communicating with the viewer and has this strength which is credible and admirable . We understand why she snaps ( . . although , it's not a theatrical snap , but a very quiet one , where she contemplates her actions and can not overcome her hostility after the horrifying murder of one of her girls , who almost got away ) , and that also relates back to Craven's infamous film where a very mature and sensitive person can become overpowered with the urge to kill , if pushed to the breaking point .
435720	9938570	285728	5.0	Dahmer	Interesting if a bit frustrating biopic looking into snippets of Dahmer , the serial killer who murdered homosexuals he desired and craved . The story-telling isn't straightforward and the filmmakers decide to intersperse flashbacks / thoughts within Dahmer's night talk with a potential victim , Rodney ( Artel Kayàru ) . Jeremy Renner was stunning in the lead and I could picture the late Dahmer in these situations thanks in part to a believable performance . I feel through interviews that he delivered his words to those he met in a rather distant cold manner as portrayed here . The film , through Renner , really seems to pointedly state that he was indeed guilty at the things he had done . You often see Dahmer in this film staring endlessly at the possibilities presented him , always puffing on cigarettes and questioning those he finds compatible sexually by challenging their ways of living . Though , the film shows many truths spoke of in biographical shows based on the notorious killer , it doesn't seem to really go anywhere . . which is probably intended . This is a probing , or better still , a peek into a lonely person's life and how it seems that killing those he cares deeply for brings the only true feelings he can express .
435695	9938570	91560	5.0	Mountaintop Motel Massacre	Evelyn ( Anna Chappell ) is let out of the asylum and takes up running a lodging of terribly run-down buildings while her daughter is playing satanism in her room . In a disorienting frenzy of trashing the witchcraftian objects and dolls in her daughter's room , Evelyn accidentally kills her with a sickle . The daughter , however , was spouting some sort of demonic gibberish just prior to be diced . This segues into the slasher part of the film where various passersby ( including the alcoholic preacher , played by Bill Thurman , who carried Evelyn's funeral services ) unknowingly stop off for lodging at the chain of shacks while a storm of nasty rain blasts down . Why anyone would pay for a building this run-down is beyond me . . heck , Evelyn should be paying them just for their courage to carry out such a venture . Evelyn , hearing the haunting echoes of her daughter's commanding voice , begins traveling through an underground tunnel which lies under the shacks occupied by the guests . There is a secret door located in each bathroom so that Evelyn can slip in and slash throats using the sickle that murdered her daughter . Before any of the killing started , she tormented them with snakes ( one bites the face of the man of a honeymooning couple ) , rats ( crawling all over the preacher ) , and roaches ( enjoying a little free time on the face and body of journeyman carpenter Crewshaw , played by Major Brock ) . You have advertising executive , Al ( Will Mitchel ) pretending to be a music exec for Columbia records so he can get laid , while the two girls just need a ride and place to stay for which he so humbly provides . This is one of those weirdo $5 backwoods slashers where the filmmakers probably gathered together friends and neighbors to work cheap on the flick . The acting exposes their lack of talent . The film looks like it was filmed in the cheapest locale in Louisiana which actually adds to the film , I felt , instead of diminishing it . The director has a talent for lighting in ways through darkness and this provides some effective scenes at night . . especially when you enter the cavernous tunnels below the shacks . Anna Chappell is effectively shot by the camera in off-angle ways presenting her as quite the creepy , bizarre character that she is . The gore is non-effective and laughable at best . Some effective moments can not compensate , however , for an hour of nearly nothing happening . . the pacing drags at a snail's pace . I felt the supernatural aspect fell flat as well . As a slasher , it works as a C-movie of interest to those head-over-heels for micro-budget , " how-low-can-you-go " brand of film-making .
436162	9938570	97388	5.0	Jason Takes Manhattan : Friday the 13th VIII	The hockey-masked zombie slayer Jason Voorhees ( Kate Hodder , in probably my favorite interpretation of the character ) rises from his watery grave of Crystal Lake boarding a cruise ship headed for New York City , adding quite a few more fresh victims to his already impressive resume . An electrical hose is damaged by a teen couple's yacht anchor awakening Jason from his slumber thanks to a charge that refreshes his corpse . After finishing them off and snatching a brand new hockey mask the male on the yacht had appropriately enough on board , he secretly hitches a ride on the cruise ship Lazarus ( appropriate title for a cruise harboring a killer who understands the meaning of returning to life ) with a graduate class of obnoxious teens to slaughter in various ways ( . . not to mention the ship's captain and assistant ) . A good portion of the film consists of Jason killing people on the cruise because director Rob Hedden had to back paddle when he was informed that budget costs limited his work in New York City . Hedden does what he can with Vancouver to at least convince us those nasty alleys are smoking Manhattan streets with druggie undesirables as perfect fodder for Jason to destroy . Even if you think his methods corny , Hedden at least attempts to return a human face to Jason with the added sub-plot regarding the heroine Rennie ( Jensen Daggett ) reliving a terrifying childhood memory of nearly drowning thanks to Jason , the boy pulling her under after Uncle Charles ( Peter Mark Richman , who is perfectly cast as the overly protective biology teacher on the trip always scolding everyone and barking orders to his students . He's quite an intolerable character ) pushes her in trying to teach her how to swim . On the cruise ship , Rennie faces reminders of Jason , whether it be the child banging on a port hole begging for help as water fills his lungs , or the shivering child appearing as an apparition in her room . This sub-text feels inspired . . at the very least , Hedden tries to inject life into a tired franchise fresh out . I think it's when he feels obligated to retreat at times to the slasher formula with rather uninspired kills ( such as the first female victim who doesn't even swat the harpoon spear Jason is slowly closing into her torso , or the hot high school bitch Tamara who gets stabbed , off screen , by a shard of glass from a mirror Jason shatters ) than Hedden often fails . And , I know many have a problem with the closing sequence inside the sewer , but I admired Hedden's effort to end the series once and for all in a unique way . . as the toxic waste flushes through the sewer , it , in a sense , removes the evil infirmities where we realize that truthfully within this sadistic monster is a frightened child now able to die in peace . There's an element of fun here if you're not too dependent on logic , or aren't too disappointed in the fact that the film doesn't cash the check as it proclaims on the poster and title . But , there's an energy behind the camera-work ( love how they zoom in on Jason , particularly on the subway and in Times Square ) and some good humorous bits such as when Jason finds a hockey sign ( the way the camera frames Jason in front of it is a treat for horror fans of the series ) , when a group of wannabe gangsters retreat from their plan to mess Jason up for destroying their jukebox when he reveals his face to them , or the inspired diner scene where Rennie and boyfriend Sean ( Scott Reeves ) ask for help because a " maniac is after them " , with the waitress ' response being , " Welcome to New York . " My favorite kill would probably be the way Jason murders a rock chick with her guitar . And , that kill with the steaming sauna rock . . OUCH !
436091	9938570	294594	5.0	The Gathering	Christina Ricci stars as an American , Cassie , who is hit by a car belonging to the wife of a art restorer ( . . . and investigator ) , Simon Kirkman ( Stephen Dillane ) who is currently working on a top-secret project regarding the restoration of a first century church buried under earth . This church , Simon discovers , was built by Joseph of Arimathea and features the faces of a gathering of on lookers who came to the crucifixion to simply watch out of idle curiosity . It is believed that the gathering were condemned ( . . by God ? ) to wander the centuries , forced to watch the same kind of horrifying acts of violence to victims as they had during Christ's crucifixion . Something in the town of Ashby Wake is going to happen and Cassie , who can not remember much about her past , has terrible premonitions regarding certain citizens suffering brutal fates . Cassie has taken to Simon's quiet son , Michael ( Harry Forrester ) , almost mute thanks to the death of his beloved mother , and , after seeing a premonition of his own demise , sets out to stop the future act with the best of her ability . A rather imposing local mechanic , Argyle ( Peter McNamara ) , Cassie discovers , was molested by his priest and certain drunken citizens as a child , and she believes he will be behind something seriously sinister , hoping to stop him before he carries it out . She meets a likable chap who lives nearby ( . . he tells her ) named Dan ( Ioan Gruffudd ) and Cassie opens up to him about her troubling premonitions and he seems supportive , but is he really an avenger for her cause ? And , how come Cassie escaped being seriously hurt after the car hit her to begin with ? Can she save Michael and stop Argyle ? To be honest I found the premise totally silly and couldn't take it seriously . But , it is a well-made thriller that builds over time , filling in the blanks , using Ricci as our guide , along with the priest ( Simon Russell Beale ) who makes some startling discoveries regarding familiar faces which show up during several various places " to watch " horrifying deaths calculated by a supreme being who forces the gathering to forever wander in time . The film , for a while , has two alternating stories , the restoration of Joseph's church and Cassie's attempts to stop a potential disaster , with them intersecting when the faces of the gathering become better known . But , for a long period of time , director Brian Gilbert and writer Anthony Horowitz maintain a heavy level of ambiguity , providing clues using premonitions , ominous faces , past memories detailing a disturbing truth which fuels the violent rampage at the end , and a heroine with several mysteries of her own which slowly unravel as the disturbing event draws near . The themes of fate and redemption are explored and Ricci's Cassie , through her amnesia , can perhaps change an event that's set to happen , unlike the gatherers who merely await in the background to watch it all unfold . It's quite an odd concept I found rather hard to swallow , but I'm pretty sure many will find it to be thought-provoking and intriguing . Like BLESS THE CHILD , not one of Christina Ricci's better known films , but might be entertaining for fans of spiritual thrillers .
436061	9938570	348150	5.0	The Return of Mr . S	Superman has been away for 5 years searching for any sign of life from his birth planet Krypton . While away , Lex Luthor was able to get out on appeal for Superman is not there in the court as the key witness to keep him behind bars . When he returns , Superman finds Lois dating another man , Richard , the assistant editor ( and general nice guy ) to Perry White of the Daily Planet . Lois also has a male child which brings to the viewer the possibility of a super-son . Lois claims the boy is Richard's . Superman takes up his crime-fighting ways and saving those in peril . Luther's partner in crime , Kitty Kowalski , helps him out on occasion , but mostly walks nearby his side tossing " witty " quips ( which seems to be one of her only purposes ; we must remember she is played by Parker Posey who has a knack for delivering witty puns ) . Luthor finds the location of where Superman received his father's guidance and instructions through the use of crystals . Luthor takes the crystals and soon finds Kryptonite buried within a rock housed in a museum . He then plans through the use of the crystals , whose power is unimaginable ( they literally can shut an entire city's power down while also growing crystal-shaped rock formations from the watery earth ) , to bury a large part of the United States under water for forming his own land for substantial gain . Will Superman be able to stop Luthor's diabolical plan while also having to save a city on the verge of collapse when the evil bald one sets just a few crystals in the ocean ? This film is a one hour forty five minute movie buried under a running time of two and a half hours . I was expecting fireworks , but said to myself once it was over , " That's it ? " Sure , there are some clever super-saving special effects in the film like how Superman rescues a crew of passengers on the verge of death landing them safely on a baseball diamond or how he is able to fly through clouds ( not to mention how a bullet simply smashes an unphased eyeball of Mr . S ) , but that big climactic wallop just really never comes . The film is more of an introduction to the characters and the casting choices , for the most part , are fine . I was quite surprised at how much Brandon reminded me of Chris Reeve . Even when he speaks , it seems like they have laid a voice-over of Reeve saying goodbye to Lois . I think Kate Bosworth makes a beautiful Lois and Spacey seems to relish his menace in the guise of Luthor . Poor Marsden ( sort of like his Cyclops in the X-Men franchise ) is the unfortunate come-between as Lois ' beau Richard . He is as good as good can be , but he isn't Superman and seems to be in this plot more for being a roadblock for the romance viewers expect from the new film . I found it laughable the way the screenplay finds ways to put Lois in peril and then showing Superman coming to her rescue right on cue . But , the most unfortunate thing is that the confrontation we wait two hours for is short-lived having their encounter brief until the next film . Really , to be brutally honest , the film's story isn't any more thrilling than a Smallville episode . We just have to watch the story develop over an exhausting two and a half hours instead of week to week . Still , despite the film not being that great , I do think now that they've made the characters clear to us , the franchise has opportunities to take off . I will certainly give a second film a chance . . I just hope they don't waste my time for an epic length next time .
435702	9938570	160184	5.0	Eye See You	A serial killer who preys on cops , murders FBI chief investigator Malloy's ( Sly Stallone ) fiancé in cold blood . Malloy and other cops track the killer , donning a SWAT suit , into an abandoned warehouse , his lair , but he's found presumably hung from a rope having committed suicide . The case seems closed , but Malloy hasn't recovered from the loss of his beloved , now an alcoholic mess in need of a good detox . His partner Hendricks ( Charles S Dutton ) is able to successfully talk Malloy into entering a detox center located in an isolated military bunker now run by a former cop ( Kris Kristofferson ) known as Doc to the small group of patients who are gathered there . When patients start turning up dead , Malloy realizes that his nemesis , the serial killer who was thought to have hung himself , has emerged staging the murders as suicides . Malloy will have to determine who amongst the group is the killer , the one that has taken the identity of a cop , having swiped the files containing the information of all involved while also removing the medicine needed to detox the patients properly . Meanwhile , Henricks discovers the body of a cop , the victim murdered by the serial killer who has assumed his identity , and will attempt to reach the bunker to assist Malloy . Superb cast have little much to do in this rather routine , woefully average mystery thriller with a fine performance from Sly Stallone as the tormented hero who can not escape the failure of not saving his girl , her memory ever fresh in his mind all the time . Out of the cast , Robert Patrick shines brightest as a paranoid , confrontational hot-head always criticizing everyone , using their frailties as a method of ridicule . Dutton really anchors the film , despite a thankless role , bringing a dignity and strength to Hendricks , a true friend to Malloy who needed someone as life was spiraling from his grasp . Polly Walker is the center's doctor , Jenny , and Malloy's damsel-in-distress . Kristofferson is the stern voice of reason , but he's given little to do , sad to say , and doesn't last too long . Jeffrey Wright rewards us with another freakshow in Jaworski , a loose cannon barely held together . Tom Berenger is the mechanic Hank , and in normal circumstances could be the lead in a film such as this , but is handed barely anything at all to work with , doing what he can . Stephen Lang is yet another smart aleck a$$hole working as an obvious red herring for who the real killer is . Christopher Fulford is Slater , a patient who seems to be a willing ear for the wounded Malloy . Courtney B Vance drops by in a very small role as a religious cop , an obvious calm source of strength needed in such a somber place . . his role is very minor and beneath his great talents . Stallone has a great opportunity here to show his acting ability , and it's a solid part , earning sympathy , which includes the typical heroism he's accustomed to delivering . EYE SEE YOU should remind viewers of THE THING as Stallone must figure out who amongst the group is the killer disguised as a cop , along with the practically deserted wintry setting in a secluded environment of the bunker where he's able to roam free throughout as victims often are attacked from behind by the predator . Everything down to the conclusion where Stallone inevitably has his showdown with the killer is familiar and derivative , unfortunately . One of Stallone's lesser ( . . if not least known , along with SHADE & AVENGING ANGELO ) known films , but contains a stellar performance that deserves to be seen by his fans regardless . From the director of I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER . Most of the murders occur off camera as victims are found dead by others .
436798	9938570	450843	5.0	The Devil	Eve ( Roxane Mesquida ) , a hot little number , turns some young adults on to following her to her place of residence . Joseph ( Vincent Cassel , who is creepy and weird . . a marvelous departure from the norm ) is an grounds-keeper who might have sinister plans in store for the group . Following along with the boys is " camel rider " Ladj ( Ladj Ly ) , a bartender friend of theirs . The country manor is home to rooms of creepy dolls , a profession Eve's parents were partakers of . There's a mysterious pregnant woman Joseph often sneaks off to attend to . Joseph also has relatives nearby in the little town who are just as strange as he is . Strange movie never quite works . I was expecting Joseph to eventually go crazy because the signs , the moronic characters seem oblivious ( . . or , blind , for a better word ) to , are there in pockets of slight outbursts and moments of aggressive behavior . We also see oddball behavior ( and quite moments of creepiness ) from Eve as well . Olivier Bartélémy's nuisance Bart is a real annoyance as he often crybabies his way through one situation or another . It's hard to feel compassion towards characters who walk head-on into a most certain difficult situation because a couple of guys want to get into Eve's panties . Cassel is the whole show . . he's able to really freak you out . Incest plays a huge part in the overall unpleasantness of this film . I thought the camera-work was repugnant and self-indulgent . . there really was no need for attempted stylistics if you believe in your story strong enough . The ending where a certain character is hit by a car at full speed and yet survives without much damage sinks the film's attempt at realism . The title is another word of The Devil .
436760	9938570	58706	5.0	Monster of London City	A serial killer , modeling his methods and look after Jack the Ripper , stalks prostitutes on the streets of 60's London , lurking the dark allies and street corners as the ever-present fog makes it's presence known . The killer surprises his prey , strangulating the girls into unconsciousness before mutilating them . There's a special vicious strike when he draws his cutting blade diving into the mod hookers before discarding them like garbage ( one girl he drives her car into a ditch while another he tosses her carcass into the river ) . Scotland Yard focus their attention on troubled actor Richard Sand ( Hansjörg Felmy ) , whose past yields a stint with drug addiction and at present is struggling with bad nerves . . he portrays Jack the Ripper in a stage production of the killer . Sir George ( Fritz Tillmann ) , an important member of Parliament , is hoping to pass a bill to remove / censor objectionable theatrical productions , often escapes , when his niece Ann ( Marianne Koch ) goes to bed , at night cautiously . . we see that his attire looks like what the copy-cat Ripper killer wears , perhaps a far-too-obvious red-herring . Ann is in love with Richard which annoys George who wishes to close the Ripper production down . Dr . Michael ( Dietmar Schönherr ) , a man in love with Ann having grown up with her after " his father died " , is good friends with Richard . All these melodramatic complications only add to poor Richard's troubles as he feels the investigation breathing down his neck and a desire to quit the Ripper character who is slowly wearing him out . The film also has Teddy ( Peer Schmidt ) and his assistant as this moronic sleuthing team hoping to catch the Ripper so they can become famous making a name for their amateur detective agency , but always come up short of that goal despite being so close . Ann suspects her Uncle after catching him whisking off one night and decides to conduct a little investigation of her own . The mystery , as explained by two other users , is not too hard to figure out which does take away from the overall appeal of this atmospherically made low-budget thriller . I loved how the director shoots the Ripper and his killing methods , not exactly displaying the cutting , but getting the grisly display over by showing how he conducts himself so thoroughly . Still , a good mystery should make the identity of the psycho a bit harder to figure out . . and , it isn't too hard in this flick's case . I think it's well crafted , but the screenplay is lacking . I like how the film feels authentic instead of stage-bound . . I think that adds to the mood of it . Even if the film may not actually take place in London , Berlin sure looks a lot like the British city and that's certainly a benefit as far as I'm concerned . Director Zbonek likes to shoot action from afar , even when the Ripper does his dirty business , lensing those desolate quiet streets where no one can help those unfortunate females needing assistance where there is none . But , stylish direction can only carry you so far and the story itself isn't anything to write home about . . even after we get an explanation of why the killer committed his heinous acts .
436658	9938570	435617	5.0	Chupacabra : Dark Seas	A scientist , Dr . Peña ( Giancaro Esposito ) is able to succeed in capturing a seemingly uncatalogued creature ( . . costing the lives of many hired hunters in the process ) , and , in turn , able to successfully board it in the cargo hold of Captain Randolph's ( John Rhys-Davies ) cruise ship . A detective , Lance ( Dylan Neal ) is brought on board the ship to uncover a thief who was able to unlock a safe , removing cash within it . Through a very unfortunate decision made by the cargo workers who loaded the crate carrying the chupacabra creature ( . . a vicious , impressively fast , flesh-eating beast which resembles a giant bat , with an exoskeleton shielding it's body from bullets ) , it is released onto the ship and it's crew . Capt Randolph and Lance will find themselves , instead of focusing on a thief , in a whole heap of trouble as the chupacabra creature goes on a deadly rampage , attacking innocents in a violent fury , as the lives of an entire cruise are in perilous danger . Randolph , after his own men , despite the heavy arsenal at their disposal , are taken apart as the chupacabra beast moves from deck to deck , room to room , will have to call in the calvary , a commando unit sent in by a military base in close proximity . Commander Link ( Matthew R Anderson ) will not only take control of the cruise ship , but order Randolph and everyone aboard to vacate so that he and his men can kill the chupacabra . . but , Link has no idea what terror lies in wait for he and his men . Meanwhile , Dr . Peña will undermine Randolph and Lance as often as possible because of his obsession to not only keep the chupacabra alive , but to prove it's existence to his colleagues and peers who dismissed his theories about such a beast . Adding to their worries is the safety of Randolph's daughter , Jenny ( Chelan Simmons , a blonde , freckled cutie with a nice rack ) , an aerobics instructor who never seems to be able to escape from the ship , despite daddy's demands that she remain safe from harm . Passable Sci-fi channel monster movie , has enough carnage to keep it fun , despite it's derivative and predictable nature . Solid cast also keep it afloat . So often , as is the case with these movies , it borders on the routine . You have the three leads with an ability to survive while Randolph and Link's men are fodder for the beast who moves really fast and explodes out of nowhere , popping up from every corner , moving through ducts , and able to escape certain capture thanks to Dr . Peña . Despite a troop of soldiers , unable to remain alive very long when confronted by the beast , Jenny is able to kickbox the monster ! Veteran character actor , Rhys-Davies lends a great deal of class to the film , his character is recognized as a hero who saved Lance's outfit in Operation Desert Storm . . his camaraderie with Neal ( Lance ) is also a plus for the film . As you'd expect many of the victims make stupid mistakes ( . . like a wealthy widow rejecting curfew orders to walk her dog , the thief constantly returning for his dufflebag of stolen loot despite knowing what dangers are in store , a cruise cook walking blindly into terror after disobeying his friend's advice not to follow a mysterious / ominous sound ) and are lunch for the beast , while , as I mentioned before , others have no prayer of surviving because they are written specifically in the film to be torn limb from limb . The gore is often made through , startling enough , practical effects ( . . make-up displaying torn flesh , one poor fellow finding the lower half of his body gone , fondling visible intestines ) with limited uses of CGI . Often , director John Shepphird forgoes showing the nasty flesh-eating , as the chupacabra attacks it's prey , merely showing blood streaking across walls . Still , I think there's enough graphic violence to satisfy .
436270	9938570	78405	5.0	The Toolbox Murders	Sick puppy from director Dennis Donnelly concerning how the car wreck demise of a young woman named Kathy causes her father and cousin to commit unspeakable acts towards innocent human beings . The father , Vance ( Cameron Mitchell ) is a simply deranged owner of the apartment complex for which he murders a set of beautiful tenants who represent " sinners " needed ridding of so that the world could be a better place . Laurie ( Pamelyn Ferdin ) shares an apartment with her mother , Jo Ann ( Aneta Corsaut ) and brother , Joey ( Nicolas Beauvy ) and Vance kidnaps her , holding the poor girl captive in his suburban home , commissioning his nephew Kent ( Wesley Eure , of " Land of the Lost " fame ! ) to clean up his bloody messes ! The police are baffled at the murders wondering just how the killer could operate so freely in dispatching them , moving within their rooms with only one forced entry . Joey , motivated by his sister's disappearance , opts to work as an amateur sleuth as he sees that Detective Jamison ( Tim Donnelly ) and the police have little to go on . Thanks to Kent , who seems to know more than he lets on ( . . while also displaying strange behavior when Joey speaks about the acts of violence and his calm demeanor around the crime scenes of the victims ' rooms he's about to clean up ) , Joey suspects Vance once entering the sicko uncle's garage , finding the infamous toolbox , containing the devices used on those women during the nightly murder spree . But , Joey will not suspect someone else . . Kent's not exactly operating with a full deck , either ! We watch as frightened , and subdued , Laurie , tied to a bed frame , attempts futilely to coerce Vance into letting her go as he drifts into his own fantasies even believing she is his daughter incarnate . Kent , also , finds himself lost to the memories of Kathy , a kissing cousin with a history he is all too willing to share with good ole Uncle Vance , with shocking results . The film doesn't really create an air of mystery as to who committed the grisly , bloody murders at the beginning of the movie , and the reasons for doing so . The director opens inside the front seat showing gloved hands driving a car past the location of where a woman died as a result of a car crash . We then are treated to a series of murders ( . . perhaps not as notorious because of how the director pulls away the camera before the weapons really do their damage , but still repulsive acts of violence ) with an assortment of weapons raging from a spinning drill driven into the back of an alcoholic who knows him and is surprised at his antics , a hammer slammed into the back of a victim's head after knocking her unconscious , a screwdriver stabbed into the stomach of a victim who stumbles upon the killer before he could leave , and a nail gun to the head of a model after her lengthly bath tub masturbation sequence . Unlike a lot of giallo thrillers and slashers ( . . which would follow a similar model as this film ) , the investigation of the murders is the weakest aspect of the film . The director instead , after bludgeoning the viewer with that wallop of a crime spree , decides to take us into the insanity of Vance , with actor Mitchell , a veteran from the old school Hollywood working in films like this for the money because of problems in his life , sucking a lollipop the first time we see him bringing din-din to Laurie . Mitchell just lets it hang out as the wacko holding so tight to the memory of his little girl and going on and on about the wicked sinners of the world with how he must cut them out like the Bible says . Eure , with those pretty boy looks and squeaky-clean image actually surprised me because he was such an innocent teenage idol on the LotL show . I could see how Joey would be startled at the true maniac that lies behind what appears to be just an ordinary young man looking for some extra dough handed out by Uncle Vance . Beauvy as Joey didn't really impress me , he's merely a plot device who makes a grave discovery whose fate is particularly memorable . Ferdin is a virginal sweetheart mostly tied to the bed hurting from the tightened bondage and worried for her life , a fawn trapped in the madness of a crazed predator ( s ) . What I found most effective was the use of country music playing as Vance murders his victims , and the way the killer carries out his acts so cold-bloodedly , with calculated precision . This will certainly be unpleasant for the weak-hearted and easily offended .
436125	9938570	69745	5.0	Female Vampire	A vampire countess and her various sexual conquests , drains the life force from her victims of passion . Countess Irina Karlstein ( Lina Romay ) often feeds from her male suitors as they are ejaculating ! The film opens the possibility of the vampire countess and a proposed rendezvous with a poet named Baron Von Rathony ( Jack Taylor ) . . Franco seems to be building to this meeting ( . . perhaps a love affair is in the future for these two ) as Rathony often hears the fluttering of bat wings in the sky from the patio of his palatial cottage overlooking a sea . Despite what the title says , this flick doesn't follow the usual vampire traits . . there isn't bloodletting ( . . in the typical sense , although there's a scene of whipping that sheds little cuts of blood ) and Lina certainly doesn't look like your usual member of the undead . Lina dives in no-holds-barred , willing to bend over backwards for director Franco as she is pretty much naked the entire film having graphic sexual sequences with men and women often rather explicitly . To be honest , the film is less a horror film than a porno flick . Franco's camera ravishes Lina's body , even closing in on Romay's vagina as she spreads her legs teasingly . Whether writhing in passion on her bed ( . . making good use of her bed post ) or bathing with erotic bliss in a bathtub of bloody water , Lina certainly is uninhibited and willing to go the distance . Not shy either is Taylor and other male actors unafraid to show their naughty bits as well . Not for the easily offended . As expected , the film often features jazz as background music often removing the slightest bit of tension ( . . although , I feel his films often are so coldly presented one feels little tension to begin with ) . The procedural with detective Franco on the case to prove Lina's involvement with the vampire-type homicides seems uninspired . My favorite scene has Lina's car driving around curves with this silver bat ornament adorning her car hood with bat wings that flap with the wind . My rating is more towards it as a horror film . I think it merely uses the idea of a vampire using lust as her way of surviving . I do think it'll work for those seeking other forms of entertainment .
435908	9938570	87096	5.0	Crackers	A motley band of desperate , unemployed , penny-less characters desire to rob Pawn Dealer Jack Warden's safe while he's off to visit his mother . Sutherland at first shrugs robbing his boss ( for the time being ; his job as Pawn shop security is threatened when Warden mentions a desire for an alarm system ) , but has motivation when he sees he'll soon be unemployed again ( . . and losing his cable box only makes matters worse ) . Warden is the " bad guy " of the film , a penny-pincher who stiff those seeking a much larger sum than he's willing to pay for their valuables . The thing is though , as Warden tries to tell the film's characters as they come in to sell stolen merchandise or valuables from their own homes , that business is business and turning a profit is essential . The flick clearly exposes the unemployment hike and immigration pressure in early 80's Reagan era . Sean Penn ( . . tries on a Southern accent to give his character flavor and fails miserably ) plays a wannabee musician , often seen blowing on his harmonica or clanging away on a guitar in Warden's pawn shop he had to give away , who is Trinidad Silva's thieving partner as they often commit petty crimes such as stealing car radios from BMWs only to get close to nothing from Warden for them . Penn takes a personal interest in Silva's sister Tasia Valenza , courting her when dear brother's back is turned ( Silva is overprotective and wishes to pair Tasia with a bartender of his own choosing from Mexico ) . You have Wallace ( MY DINNER WITH ANDRE ) Shawn as an always-hungry pauper who is friends with Sutherland and hangs around the pawn shop playing chess all day ( it's rare you don't see Shawn eating something which is a gag the film plays to the hilt ) . There's Larry Riley as a would-be pimp stuck with the baby of a former " employee " . Following the cast of supposed safe crackers are Christine Baranski as a meter-lady who writes the tickets for those who stay parked too long on the side-walk who likes to moonlight as a slut and Charlayne Woodard as an always-unemployed maid who hooks up with Riley . All that said , this is a forgettable , minor film from critically acclaimed director Louis Malle with a decent cast not having that much to do . It supposed to play as a bumbling-thieves comedy , but seems to want to take a detour into character study . I'd say unless you just wish to see the film for it's cast , this is a very skippable film which ends with the characters looking quite silly at staging such an attempt towards cracking the safe . They still face what we saw them against at the start of the film . After watching the film , I just felt that this flick wastes our time .
435807	9938570	80431	5.0	Beyond Evil	Newly married couple , Larry and Barbara Andrews ( John Saxon & Lynda Day George ) move to a reputedly haunted mansion , Casa Fortuna , which yields a vengeful witch's spirit with strong powers . Poor Barbara's body and soul are slowly taken over by the spirit , Alma Martin ( Janice Lynde , under various wigs ) , and those Larry works with during the construction of a major hotel , such as pal Del Giorgio ( Michael Dante ) and Dr . Frank Albanos ( Mario Milano ) both men with a lot riding on the job and it's business potential , are in danger of her wrath . A worried Larry , whose own life is threatened when a crane , operated by Alma's spirit , carrying heavy material used for construction which nearly falls on top of him ( . . killing a co-worker by him ) , will seek help from a faith healer Doctor Solomon ( David Opatoshu ) . But , as Alma slowly gains control of Barbara her powers emerge , such as green laser blasts from the eyes , superhuman abilities to lift and throw men in the air , pulling a car apart before exploding it down a cliff , etc . Larry and Solomon will have to work together to somehow stop Alma from totally taking control . From the director of " Graduation Day " ( . . another Troma release ) , Herb Freed tries his hand in the demonic thriller genre . I think the cast gives it their best shot , but the budget is just too small and so many scenes show signs of post production tinkering where one scene doesn't transition smoothly to the next and the special effects ( . . particularly when Alma uses her powers , with green tint often appearing like a halo around Day George's head before she blasts somebody ) are rather cheap . I think one often needs an appropriate budget when approaching a film about demonic possession and a lot of the special effects undermine a decent effort from the director . I must also admit that there are some lighting issues , with a lot of scenes so dark you could barely see the actors , especially at night . I'm certainly not against low-budget film-making , and I think setting your film on an island inside a mansion which carries a certain flavor of it's surroundings certainly helps . I think the leads are fine . Saxon is the concerned husband , often playing him as conflicted and confused . Day George shows the battle of personalities raging inside , the sweet innocent Babs , and the evil Alma starting to take over . Lynde as Alma is actually pretty creepy with how she widens her mad eyes , opening her fingers exposing those long nails as she shoots green light . I think if Herb just had some more money , and decidedly remained away from using special effects concerning colors , he'd had a better film . But , it's assured that people will watch this with uncontrollable laughter , certainly at the special effects and perhaps hold a feeling of embarrassment for Saxon and Day George who deserve a better film . There are some make-up effects concerning Solomon's faith healing rituals where he slices open the stomach of " patients " removing the problems plaguing them ( . . one case goes wrong , to a child no less , when Alma interferes ) that work well .
435773	9938570	100114	5.0	Marked for Death	" Screwface has two heads and four eyes , and that's the secret to his magic . " Lincoln Heights , a cushy suburb of Chicago , is being overrun by Jamaican drug-lord Screwface who is selling to the white youth on school grounds . Burned-out , retired DEA agent John Hatcher ( Steven Seagal ) gets in the middle of a blood feud with Screwface and his cronies when they threaten his family after he exposes them in a bar shootout with Colombians that goes awry . Teaming with old Vietnam war buddy Max ( Keith David ; now a football coach with a player and family exposed to the ills of Screwface's drug trade ) and a Jamaican cop Charles ( Tom Wright ) who has spent his career trying to take apart Screwface's drug trade , they will infiltrate the cartel with many dead bodies lying in the wake . The title of the movie represents a Voodoo curse placed on Hatcher and his family for he has corrupted their business with his involvement in putting a stop to them . About as dumb as these typical actioners come , it supplies fans of Seagal for what they ask for . . car chases , gun-fights , sword-fights , and snapped limbs . Seagal's hands are amazingly swift and he's able to mow over these Jamaican scum with ease . It doesn't stray far from the usual formula of a Steven Seagal picture . . it's all about the man taking out the trash in graphically violent ways . Many arms and legs are snapped like a twig and the villains are merely clichéd vermin to be eradicated like cockroaches . . Seagal is the quintessential exterminator . The lovely Joanna Pacula has a thankless role as an expert in Voodoo assisting love-interest Seagal with information about his nemesis ' religious practices . Basil Wallace is unintentionally hilarious as the over-the-top , spitting , bulging-eyed drug-lord . The Jamaican gangsters are presented as uneducated twats who can not pronounce a single sentence plainly .
436298	9938570	89038	5.0	Don't Open ' Til Christmas	Oddly structured , startlingly sadistic , and extremely sleazy British slasher concerning a maniac viciously stabbing and slashing unfortunate victims who happen to make the mistake of wearing a Santa costume during the Christmas holiday season . Inspector Harris ( Edmund Purdom ) is being grilled by his superior at Scotland Yard to solve the case before Christmas Day arrives , but he doesn't entirely seem that interested in finding the perpetrator , singling out Cliff Boyd ( Gerry Sundquist ) , the live-in boyfriend of a wealthy heiress , Kate ( Belinda Mayne ) whose father was a victim of the Santa Claus killer when dressed like Jolly Saint Nick one night at a party ( . . thanks to a spear through his head and out his mouth . . ouch ! ) who couldn't possibly be the one responsible if he were standing beside his lover when the murder took place . When Harris comes up with no results , he's suspended and his associate , Sergeant Powell ( Mark Jones ) takes over , given information by a creepy supposed newspaper journalist , Giles ( Alan Lake ) to keep an eye on the Inspector for he might know more than he letting on regarding the Santa Claus killer . Kate begins her own investigation in true slasher / giallo fashion and finds the man she was looking for , while also possibly falling for Harris , discovering that he visits an institution for the insane . Who's Harris visiting and does this revelation possibly lead to the killer ? As far as Giles goes , what he to do in the grand scheme of things ? The film also shows that a stripper , who witnesses a murder through her glass terminal towards someone wearing a Santa costume , who gave what little information she knew to Scotland Yard , herself is kidnapped by the mysterious killer , given a little time alive , imprisoned in a small makeshift room hoping that he makes a false move so she can escape . Pretty messy which is understandable due to it's difficult production problems . This is a must for slasher fans , though , as it features ample doses of both nudity and violence . Different types of sharp weapons are used to plunge into the bellies and faces of victims who are stalked down streets into darkened buildings , often throughout alleys . One especially memorable kill concerns a castration in a bathroom as the poor chap is relieving himself . My favorite sequence is where this drunken Santa attempts to hide from the killer in a darkened wax museum . Also memorable is one Santa victim's fate in the Piccadily theater as Caroline Munro portrays a pop singer belting a tune as she swivels her curves for an unseen audience . For fans of all things lurid , the film often takes place in seedier sides of London and the killer decides to check out a nude model underneath a Santa coat as the straight-razor slides seductively down her naked chest . The film never quite gels overall and the characters aren't given flesh perhaps due to a lot of footage not so easy to piece together even by the third director who was an editor . The reveal as to why the killer is offing unsavory sorts donning Santa outfits is as sleazy as the overall product which won't disappoint those accustomed to 80's slashers .
436793	9938570	176799	5.0	Hangman	Serial killer detective thriller regarding a Police Detective's search for a slick murderer using an Internet game of Hangman , as a challenge to find him / her . Detective Nick Roos ( Lou Diamond Phillips ) enlists the aid of " retired " pill-popping psychotherapist , Grace Mitchell ( Mädchen Amick ) , who supposedly awakened to find a man hung in her living room . As Roos and his precinct squad work to find the killer , a development seems to be occurring , those chosen by the Hangman are affiliated with Grace and her former place of employment , a psychiatric institute ran by her estranged stepfather , Dr . Henry Mitchell ( Robert Haley ) . As Roos pursues leads and evidence , his team uncover suspicions of an employee , Paul Jarvis ( Grant Nickalls ) who was once a patient at the institute , carrying a torch for Grace . Roos also discovers that Grace's reason for leaving had to do with an affair and some bad blood associated to Dr . Henry's associate , Dr . Natalie Walsh ( Rosemary Dunsmore ) . It seems that Natalie was having an affair with Henry as Grace's mother lie dying . Natalie's medical practices with patients was reported by Grace but Henry saved her from being terminated thanks to his powerful influence with the board . In turn , Grace was marked , with Natalie using her affair with a deeply depressed patient as leverage . Meanwhile Jarvis was stalking Grace , obsessed with her since first meeting her in the institute . The film shows that Jarvis was sneaking into a room right next to Grace's , even calling in a masseuse who would be a victim of the Hangman game . . this took some gall considering that an armed policeman was guarding Grace's room and Roos was talking to her about the on-going case . Obvious , for those who have seen their fair share of these films , Jarvis is a red herring and the true mastermind will be revealed even though Paul isn't an innocent . The film features familiar traits often associated with these types of films and crime shows dealing with a detective who is burdened to find the killer , and we see how Roos is led on a wild goose chase with his superiors demanding answers , willing to close what they believe is a solved case when a man of his experience knows something's amiss . Also , the film ( . . as often as occurs in this type of crime thriller ) allows the super-intelligent killer to perfectly plan and execute these incredibly difficult / elaborate Hangman murders encountering no problems , carrying them out without a hitch . I always find this far-fetched , but there are serial killers who have survived for a long time , duping police and investigators , but considering who the mastermind is in this film and how incredibly hard it would be to pull off the murders , staged the way they are , the participants involved , and the exact precision it takes without even the slightest mistake , you have to accept it as entertainment in order to fully swallow what's taking place . The film doesn't end the way many often expect , not at a neat resolution for our heroes as is often the case in the past involving detectives and their catching the killer responsible . We're asked to take a leap of faith considering that we must accept a character's personality changing quite drastically when the reveal takes place and the film unveils it's hand . Like many television shows and crime dramas , the detectives often face heavy resistance from sneering , slimy big-city lawyers who enjoy embarrassing them when it is shown that they were either wrong about an arrested suspect or just didn't have the proper evidence to hold him . And , like any giallo or mystery , the story opens numerous suspects , and a motive for committing such crimes soon is enlightened to the viewer . I think this film will possibly find a home with those who like slippery thrillers where the killer stays one step ahead of the police until the lead detective puts two + two together . . the whole cat-and-mouse aspects might draw you in if you are a sucker for this sort of thing . Startling erotic sequence isn't expected and unveils the psychology of the murderer who'll do whatever it takes to get revenge . As always Lou Diamond allows his detective a sense of dignity and compassion , but he's quite gullible at times which exposes him as being human when it comes to shady characters with ulterior motives . Flashy role for Mädchen Amick , whose character is complex and conflicted , with plenty of skeletons in her closet .
435871	9938570	900381	5.0	Trackman	Thieves remove money and three hostages from a Russian bank , take it to a labyrinthine underground subway system of tunnels where their mastermind is supposed to be waiting since he understands where the exit is . What the three bank robbers don't expect is a psycho wielding a pickax with a penchant for removing eyeballs as keepsakes ! The film highlights Grom ( Dmitri Orlov ) as the most level-headed humane figure among the thieves who soon becomes leader of their motley frightened group hoping to set some sort of trap for the killer , but his problem is that only the " trackman " understands his way around the underground maze . Kostya ( Tomas Motskus ) and his partner were responsible for this seemingly perfect plan of snatch-grab-hide-and-escape not knowing that there would be a major set-back awaiting them in the tunnels . Kostya and his pal had planned on keeping the loot for themselves which , in a wicked twist of fate , is spoiled thanks to their choice of location . The killer wears an eerie pair of goggles over a ski-mask , heavy overcoat and pants , carrying not only his trusty pick-ax but an eye-removing device as well ( . . one of those nasty kind of creations obviously designed and made by his own mind and hands ) . Director Igor Shavlak often shoots the trackman in ominous ways and really exploits the dread of our characters ' situation thanks in part to the choice of location . The ancient abandoned underground subway tunnels make an ideal choice for an atmospheric hunting ground for a killer , and the perilous situation our characters find themselves in works in the film's favor . The idea that the killer knows the method of travel and escape in the tunnels as the others attempt various ways to escape heightens the suspense even though slasher fans have seen this all before . Director Shavlak mostly pulls his punches , not really elaborating on the attacks with great detail , disguising the pick-ax violence ( . . and eyeball extracting ) through cunning camera-movements and editing . What is a constant , a certain success , is that the location , claustrophobic and unsettling , where light is privilege the characters often lack and their cold breath is always visible , works it's hold over you . . you would certainly not want to be caught in this environment with a killer who knows where every nook and cranny is of the place . Unlike a great number of films in the slasher genre , the identity of the killer is of no great importance to the plot as a whole . He's a warped and dangerous psychopath who constantly threatens those he pursues . Guns are used in ways which shape the outcome of certain characters ' lives thanks to a killer who hides and moves well in the dark patches of the place with fear often separating them . One robber , who decides that there's no way in hell the killer would get his trophy , slashes his own eyes with a blade . We do witness an eyeball being pried away from the socket , but it's rather brief . I think the novelty of this being a Russian slasher might catch on with fans of the genre , while others will find it just another average entry in the ever-growing cycle of films regarding a serial killer chasing his prey .
436481	9938570	758746	5.0	Friday the 13th	Underwhelming , formulaic " addition " to the Friday the 13th franchise has hockey-masked psychopath Jason Voorhies killing a group of teenagers who make the unfortunate mistake of trespassing on his property , the wilderness and surrounding area of his home and Camp Crystal Lake . The film opens with Jason , as a boy , watching his mother being beheaded by the remaining survivor of a group of camp counselors ( . . this opening is incredibly disappointing and uninspired ) . He picks up a neck-laced locket with his mother's ( . . and his ) picture inside . Years later , a group of teenagers are on the pursuit of marijuana , building a camp in the wilderness nearby Crystal Lake , falling prey to Jason ( . . at this point wearing a pillow case over his head with an eye hole cut to see ) . Whitney Miller ( Amanda Righetti ) watches as her boyfriend is attacked by Jason while they are touring through a ravaged house belonging to the killer's mom . Running like hell , she encounters her fallen friends and as Jason is about to drop his machete towards her face , the screen fades black ( . . a plot point to add : her boyfriend encounters the locket noting to Whitney that she favors the woman's picture ) . Whitney's brother , Clay ( Jared Padalecki of " Supernatural " fame ) is searching for her , probing the area of Crystal Lake hoping that a citizen might've recognized her , encountering locals who warn him to leave . Meanwhile , another group of partying teenagers decide to crash at the wealthy estate of Trent's ( Travis Van Winkle ) father . Jenna ( Danielle Panabaker , who has blossomed into an attractive young woman ) , Trent's girlfriend , opts to assist Clay ( . . they seem to know each other as does Trent who does not embrace Clay's presence , seeing him as a threat , hostile towards him ) in his search while others smoke dope and get wasted . Clay and Jenna discover some gruesome truths regarding Jason after finding the psychopath with a dead body draped over his shoulder . We will also discover what happened to Whitney along the way . I will admit that this remake / reboot / whatever looks fabulous . . it is dark , gritty , and polished . Director Marcus Nispel and Platinum Dunes essentially give this film the same kind of look their TCM " re-envisioning " had . The film has all the bells and whistles money could buy but lacks that sense of fun the franchise always had . . it's an exercise in weapons stabbing victims with characters running for their life or finding Jason's massive presence behind them . Jason is indeed a menace and kills with an authority everyone ( . . except one female character ) in his path . It's simple really . . if you invade his turf , you die a horrible death . The film is essentially a series of graphic violence towards teenagers . . the machete rips through bodies a lot . Victims ' backs are turned and the blade penetrates them all the way through ( . . we see their shocked reactions as the machettes bursts from their chest ) . Savage murders include an ax thrown at a victim as he retreats ( . . slamming into the guy's back ) , an arrow stabbing a victim driving a motorboat ( . . through the skull ) , a fireplace poker inserted through the eye of the local sheriff ( . . and through Trent's father's front door ) , a girl is " antlered " ( . . an obvious homage to Silent Night , Deadly Night ) , one girl is trapped in a sleeping bag upside down over a camp fire , one guy's ankle gets caught in a bear trap with the bone and ripped flesh present ( . . also receiving a machete slammed into his face ) , one girl ( . . underneath a bridge in Crystal Lake hoping to avoid Jason ) getting rammed directly into the skull by the tip of the machete , another victim slowly stabbed into the throat with a screwdriver , etc . Nispel often shoots the film at night . . a moody , brooding , forbidding place where victims barely stand a chance . The wilderness and home of Jason around Camp Crystal Lake are a murky , decadent environment civilization has left to rot . Jason has no personality . . he's simply a killing machine who awaits vulnerable victims , mainly when they are alone or in the middle of something . The cast is your basic stock group of attractive disposable teens , lambs to the slaughter , representing basic stereotypes we slasher fans know all too well . There's a pretty lame set-up for how Jason finds his hockey-mask . Nothing about this film is fresh or original , although many of the chase scenes are exciting accompanied by a pulse-poundingly loud musical score and frenzied camera attempting to capture the horror of it all , with " jump scare " sound effects ever present to make theater-goers scream with fright . I rather liked Padalecki and Panabaker . . they are likable enough and not overbearing . The others meant nothing to me although , Julianna Guill is quite a sex kitten who sheds her clothes ( . . having sex with Trent who can not escape his lustful desire for her ) and Willa Ford goes water boarding topless , so that was appreciated . For slasher fans only .
436936	9938570	120841	5.0	Species II	Patrick Ross ( Justin Lizard ) was the very first man to step foot on Mars . But , in one of the planetary samples , a specific fungus carrying the alien race from the first SPECIES film thaws out on board the American space shuttle and invade the body of Patrick and astronaut Anne Sampas ( Myriam Cyr ) . For some strange reason , Dennis Gamble ( Mykelti Williamson ) wasn't invaded by the alien . Later testing might prove that being a sickle cell anemia carrier might've saved him . This also might be a key to killing them because it's proved through experimental testing by Dr . Laura Baker ( Marg Helgenberger ) on clone half-human / half-alien Eve ( the VERY , VERY sexy Natasha Henstridge ) that the breed are able to regenerate cells . When women are being found mutilated soon the government will be on the lookout for Patrick , who has been having sex with various females ( hookers , lovers , admirers , etc ) and impregnating them with half-human / half-alien children who burst from the stomach not too long after mating occurs . When these children reach a certain stage in numerous days , they will turn into a cocoon and once released will be fully grown to terrorize and conquer the human race . Colonel Carter Burgess , Jr ( George Dzundza ) is the military muscle behind pushing the experimental project for finding a way to kill the alien species and when he discovers that another is on earth ( . . after the murder of a scientist who discovers alien genes in Patrick's blood ) , he calls in Press Lennox ( Michael Madsen ) , the kind of special ops man / bounty hunter with a skill for finding prey he target . He's the man the government call in to do their dirty work . He'll team with Dennis who sees for himself , when Patrick blows his head off with a shotgun ( . . with it subsequently regenerating before his very eyes ) , what the alien is . Laura , who has bonded with Eve during their period of time together ( . . while it's Laura's job to find a way to kill Eve , it's really her agenda to protect her from harm ) , will also have to team with press to stop what could be a global disaster from taking place . Patrick must be stopped and the storage place of the cocooning aliens must be found before it's too late . The most prominent threat . . if Patrick and Eve mate an even more advanced alien being might emerge perhaps too unstoppable for anyone to handle . The cast doesn't have a lot to do except quote their lines and the film is rather derivative of other similar sci-fi films using threatening aliens , but I found it decently entertaining in a race-against-time sort of way . I wanted more Henstridge , here used more as a sympathetic being , and the pace is so fast plot can not catch up . . but , I'm one in the minority who doesn't believe this is the worst sequel ever . It was just not as well developed , screenplay-wise . It does feel rushed , but has some gruesome alien-attack sequences such as the aliens protruding from the bellies of their human mother hosts . It's forgettable , but could be looked at as a flick to watch when you got time to kill .
436262	9938570	70603	6.0	Curse of the Devil	Irineus Daninsky ( Paul Naschy ) and his men , crusading in the name of God , execute a group of Satanists and his ancestry are cursed by E Bathory as she is burned alive . The movie continues many years later as a descendant , Waldemar , kills a wolf which was actually a male member of gypsies who call upon the Devil ( a man dressed in a black suit and gloves . . quite a surreal sequence in a cave ) to have sex in a cavernous worshiping lair swearing to torment him with a curse . A pretty one from their group seduces Waldemar later sprinkling some of her " infected " blood on the skull of a wolf's head pressing a nasty bite into his flesh . He is now to become a werewolf at the Full Moon always to terrorize innocents biting and slashing . A vicious ax-killer is also on the loose chopping up pretty ladies and beheads the satanic woman who accursed Waldemar with werewolf blood . The ax killer will also do battle with Waldemar in werewolf form . A family from Budapest set roots in a cottage nearby Waldemar . Waldemar falls in love with the older daughter of the Wilowa family who informs him she's pregnant with his child . Her jealous younger sister seduces Waldemar . . at the wrong time , a night of the Full Moon , and becomes another in a growing line of werewolf victims . Soon many villagers ( . . and a traveling troupe camping nearby Waldemar's estate ) are getting their throats slashed and faces ripped to shreds . By the end of the film , most of the film's cast are destroyed by Waldemar , in werewolf form . Not too bad , I thought , as far as the series goes . Mixes the occult within the werewolf sub-genre for some interesting results . I think it would work a lot better if given a better soundtrack , in Spanish language with subtitles ( truly terrible dubbing where it seems that those who spoke the dialogue had contempt for the material making this flick cheesy when it could be an more serious werewolf product ) , and had snappier pacing . But , this delivers on the gore . . lots of bloody gaping throat wounds and facial tears . The werewolf even slams a huge stone across a victim's face ! Also has a grisly scene towards the end as villagers decide to form a lynch-mob killing Waldemar's hired help and comrade with farm equipment . Beautiful location assists , especially at night where my favorite sequences seem to take place . Chock full of nude female flesh as well . Not as good as " Werewolf Shadow " , but not the worst werewolf film I've seen .
436519	9938570	50432	6.0	The Giant Claw	A giant extra-terrestrial buzzard with an anti-matter forcefield ( . . I'm not making this up ! ) is terrorizing the world , flying at intense speeds , downing vehicles in flight , chomping on parachuting innocents attempting to escape , and swooping down to cause death and destruction . It's up to our brave government and scientists to figure out how to penetrate it's forcefield so that the rockets and bullets we fire from our artillery can end it's reign of terror for good . Directed by Fred F Sears ( The Werewolf ; Earth vs The Flying Saucers ) and starring Jeff Morrow ( This Island Earth ; The Creature Walks Among Us ) as an " electronics wiz " , Mitch MacAfee who works with the military to solve the crisis regarding the anti-matter forcefield , hoping to find a flaw , creating a weapon of some sort to remove this shield used to protect itself from invading hostile threats towards it's body . Mara Corday is Sally , a mathematics genius and Mitch's love-interest who helps keep him centered and focused . The dialogue is full of delightfully dated and cornball ( . . terms like " we'll throw everything but the kitchen sink at ' im " or " Holy Toledo " or " I must've lost my marbles " ) , with much fun derived from the inner arguments between this civilian Mitch and the government assigned to find answers to a terrifying crisis where time is limited and martial law is declared as the giant killer bird causes nothing but problems with the public in cities or across the country . It swoops down to grab a moving locomotive train from it's tracks , lands upon the United Nations building , smashing it to smithereens . Falling debris has city folk running for their lives . The blasted alien buzzard even has an egg for which Mitch and Sally destroy . The film will cause much amusement as the characters carry on with grave expressions , many at each other's throats due to the crisis at hand . Good stuff . The puppet buzzard is a hoot . Many will find it rather embarrassing as I'm sure those who starred in this did , but I couldn't stop giggling at what the characters were forced to say , the cast attempting with dignity to bring an authenticity to such a rubbish , outrageous plot . Like in a lot of these B-movies , a dark , brooding narrative voice speaks about the job of our men and women , also foretelling danger regarding the monster in the sky .
436840	9938570	68415	6.0	Seven Deaths in the Cat's Eye	Gothic giallo from the late Antonio Margheriti ( Castle of Blood ) with the novelty of a cat always present at the scene of murders , by a leather gloved killer using a razor , which occur in and around the castle estate of the family MacGrieff . The actual proprietor of the castle , James ( Hiram Keller ) , is deemed mad by his family doctor , Franz ( Anton Diffring ) and held responsible for the murder of his sister as a child . James ' mother Mary ( Françoise Christophe ) faces a difficult financial crisis which may leave them without their ancestral home . Trying to persuade monetary backing from her sister Alicia ( Dana Ghia ) , Mary promises Franz , who are secretly lovers , that she will keep the castle , one way or another . Alicia's daughter , Corringa ( Jane Birkin ) , arriving unannounced after being expelled from Catholic school , will soon face a horrifying ordeal . . her mother is suffocated by someone , leaving Corringa on her own to possibly face the killer whoever it may be . Could it be Mary , willing to do whatever it takes to keep the castle ? Could it be James , who has such a harsh attitude towards nearly everyone ( . . and with a record , whether it be real or a set-up ) and is considered emotionally hostile ? Is it the hired french teacher , Suzanne ( the delicious Doris Kunstmann who run rings around Birkin in a very sexy , albeit slutty , turn as whore hired by Franz to seduce James ) who might have a concocted plan with Franz at getting their hands on Mary's estate if everyone is killed off ? Is it secretly Franz , who is bedding two women under the same castle roof ? As each possible suspect is eliminated we'll know soon enough . Venantino Venantini has a limited but crucial role as a trusted priest , Father Robertson . Keeping the spirit of Mario Bava alive , Margheriti uses the environment of his castle , grounds , family cemetery & crypt , really well . He tries , through some enthusiastic camera movements , to make up for a deranged screenplay . There's a lot of naughty activity taking place within the film's castle . Margheriti sure grabs you right away opening the film with a wail from this unfortunate soul , after having his neck slit , placed in a trunk , tossed down the spiraling steps into a creepy cellar , with his corpse exploding forth with rats having a grand time using his body as lunch . . we see the poor guy's torn face , ripped apart and exposing the skull underneath . As always , the giallo trademark of the deck being stacked against a specific character ( Lord James , who is easily recognized as a red herring , once Corringa gets involved with him , opening an incestuous love affair between kissin ' cousins ) is here as is the convoluted plot yielding countless twists peppered with a corrupt group of characters offering much in the way of seedy melodrama . The violence is mostly blood spray across walls after a victim is sliced off-camera . Nudity is limited to Kunstmann showing her breasts . Unusually Birkin , as the innocent , naive and jaded protagonist , doesn't get out of her clothes , although there's one juicy implied lesbian crush as Suzanne lustfully sets her eyes on Corringa as she removes her stockings . Also thrown in is James ' pet gorilla ( ! ) , the proposed idea that the relatives of MacGrieff return from the dead as vampires if murdered by their own kin , and the reveal of the killer ( . . which seemed pulled right out of the screenwriter's ass at the last possible moment ) showing that this particular film falls right in line with the giallo genre of Italian cinema which populated the screens of the 70's .
436852	9938570	105217	6.0	Raising Cain	Now I know directors of today love the hyperkenetic , shaking camera and the fast editing technique , but watching " Raising Cain " has awakened why I love the methodical , slow-burning Steadi-cam . . that fluid camera flow is a thing of beauty . Even if the film from De Palma is less-than-stellar ( a rehash of other film ideas done to death such as split personalities and non-stop use of dream sequences which often distort reality ) , the film's main star is indeed the camera stylistics . The long unedited tracking shot of Dr . Lynn Waldheim ( Frances Sternhagen ) explaining her history with child psychologist Dr . Nix with detectives Lt . Terry and Sgt . Cully ( Gregg Henry & Tom Bower , who work well together and clearly are enjoying themselves ) as they walk from their office upstairs down to the morgue should be a pleasure for fans of " Rope " ( you'll be reminded of the amazing opening sequence with Nicholas Cage in " Snake Eyes " ) . There's also a highly inspired climax at a hotel where the real Dr . Nix is secretly staying that is a visual wonder to behold as well . The film is about the troubled Carter ( John Lithgow ) , an example of a traumatized abusive childhood with split personalities . His evil personality comes in the form of Cain . . the one who kills and does the dirty work for dear dad such as stealing children for the old man's experiments . Two other personalities lie within . . Josh , a child who stays in constant panic of Dr . Nix's perhaps drawing near , and a mysterious female personality in the form of Margo . Margo is the interesting one because her voice remains silent yet could be the most meticulous and craft personality of them all . Lolita Davidovich is absolutely sexy as Carter's wife Jenny who still has a thing for hunky Jack ( Steven Bauer ) . Her adulterous betrayal sets off a series of events that lead to the framing of a murder and other dire consequences where poor Carter will be the victim of tragedy again . Carter seems to be the reluctant victim called on to do dastardly deeds he can't accomplish because the evil to do such things isn't there . Cain is clearly like Norman Bates ' mother personality ( though , Margo might be also . . her voice isn't heard but actions speak louder , don't they ? ) . . the dominant , benevolent one who can accomplish what dear old dad desires . Brian De Palma gives John Lithgow free reign to play his numerous characters to the hilt and I'd be lying if I said I wasn't entertained . Watching him twist into Cain from the weak Carter is so much fun because he plays the evil one with such flair . The film is pretty preposterous , though , and asks us to believe that a man could walk out of a police precinct so easily towards the end leading to the hotel climax is hard to swallow . The film has such grand style that it was hard not to enjoy it . I know the film material is old-hat and his ripping off the " car-river drowning " sequence from PSYCHO is hard to not be disgusted at . De Palma can't resist these impulses and they cost him this time .
436340	9938570	76068	6.0	Watch Me When I Kill	Those familiar with Antonio Bido anyway , the director of WHO SAW HER DIE ? & THE BLOOD STAINED SHADOW , understand that his giallo thrillers are always leisurely paced ( . . to say the least ) with LOTS of plot . And , there's always a sense of real sadness behind the plot , real tragedy often motivates the story with characters uncovering horrible truths . And , WATCH ME WHEN I KILL is no different , it is insanely convoluted yielding such a melancholy conclusion when our detective hero finally figures out the painful reasons behind a series of murders in ( . . and outside of ) Rome . Three characters share a secret involving the Nazis and a family they betray and this fuels the killer who hunts each down , waiting for the right time , when they are most vulnerable , slaying them from behind . The first is a pharmacist stabbed in the back , the killer slicing his throat . The second , a female character named Esmeralda ( Bianca Toccafaondi ) , who is friends with Giovanni Bozzi ( Fernando Cerulli ) , a businessman with corrupt lending practices , she has a history with . Bozzi seeks aid from neighbor , Lukas ( Corrado Pani ) regarding disturbing phone calls featuring a collage of loud , random sounds which mean little to him , yet are enough to cause concern . Lukas is also assigned to protect his actress girlfriend , Mara ( Paola Tedesco ) who came across a crime in progress ( . . the pharmacy as the killer escaped quickly ) and has been targeted for possibly seeing too much . Lukas begins his own investigation into the murders , and soon realizes that his girlfriend's pursuer and the killer behind the others are related . Soon , a judge ( Giuseppe Addobbati ) , a wrongfully accused escaped con ( Franco Citti ) , and a screenplay writer ( Paolo Malco ) all have their own part within the convoluted story . I will admit that I labored through WATCH ME WHEN I KILL , even though I respect director Bido for the ambitious story and it's chilling finale when we get all the facts after a lot exposition . I thought the score , supplied to us by Trans Europa Express was fabulous , good mixture of styles which often provide the film with a texture complimenting the shifts in tone ( . . while also making the long haul a little more bearable ) . I wasn't as critical of the acting and think the important characters were handled reasonably well . I agree with others that the dubbing and dialogue effects the impact of the film because characters are often saddled with cringe-worthy words that were perhaps more articulate in the Italian language . I for one liked Pani as the lead detective . . he had the look down , and the cigar was a nice touch , and he never , to me anyway , ever committed a dopey characterization which would make him unsympathetic or unworthy of interest . The trademark giallo POV shot for the killer is often relied upon , and there's really nothing particularly stylish or fresh . . that could be looked at as perhaps a positive for Bido , his conscious decision to bare more emphasis on the story , not dependent upon certain camera angles or imaginative methods at keeping our attention . The murders themselves are vicious affairs ( . . especially the final strangulation using a shower head's extension cord ) which correspond with what their past mistake resulted in . . the savagery with which the killer conducts his work ( . . such as the grisly sequence where Esmeralda's face is buried in a beef stew she was preparing on a skillet ) correlates with how certain family members fell to the Nazis . Also important is a family photo with faces cut representing lost lives .
436490	9938570	119975	6.0	Quicksilver Highway	" I'm chronicling the real America , not the ideal America . . the warts , the coarse black hairs , the dark underbelly of a nation trying to fool itself that it has none . . . . There is no light without darkness , no life without death , no peace without war , no God without Satan . . . . I'm a boatman on the River Styx in Black Asphalt . . a traveler on Route 666 . " Introducing himself to recent , wedding-dress clad bride , Olivia ( Missy Crider ) is Aaron Quicksilver ( Christopher Lloyd , dressed as if he walked off the set of THE ADDAMS FAMILY ) a storyteller of the absurd and macabre and does he have quite the tale for her . Olivia is awaiting her husband off to find assistance due to their car having a flat tire . In the story Quicksilver tells her is Bill Hogan ( Raphael Sbarge , also portraying Olivia's husband Kerry off to get some help ) a bar-code label salesman who runs into a psycho hitchhiker on his way home through a bad dust storm that doesn't let up . Luckily , Bill has aide when a vehicle crash , during the hitcher's threats to kill him , causes his van to run off the road and upside down into a gully . Unable to unlock his seat , it seems as if Bill is sure bait for the killer , but is assisted by a steel toy he received by an old man running a grocery store nearby . That steel toy is chattery teeth with legs ! This tale is based on a Stephen King story called " Chattery Teeth . " In the wraparound , Olivia finds that this story hits closer to home than she could possibly ever realize . Matt Frewer , a Mick Garris vet , is Charlie , a pickpocket who happens across a gallery of oddities at a carnival , operated by . . . Aaron Quicksilver . Charlie spots a wax hand which serves as a candle for Quicksilver on display . Quicksilver has a tale for Charlie and it consists of a plastic surgeon , Dr . Charles George whose hands are rebelling against him ! We see them actually talking to each other in conversation , the hands I mean ( I'm not joking , we hear them speaking words as certain fingers act as lips ! ) , planning to escape the tyranny of the body seeking freedom ! Poor Charles George can not understand why his hands would wish to kill his beloved wife or sever ties with him . The rest of the tale consists of one hand , severing itself from Charles ' arm , causing turmoil amongst a hospital staff telling the hands of everyone to revolt ! Charles must make an ultimate decision . . one remaining attached hand seems to be a " messiah " for the other hands and will have to die with his suicide the possible only viable option left to make . And , in the wraparound , pickpocket Charlie might not have the chance to use his hands for criminal activity any longer . Based on Clive Barker's story , " The Body Politic . " Now , both stories are insane dealing with bizarre tales of horror . The outrageous nature of both tales might work for those willing to suspend disbelief . The beautiful , fluid camera-work , often always an asset in even director Garris ' worst films , is on display here . The hands running free in a hospital causing havoc has to be seen to be believed . If one has seen the ADDAMS FAMILY feature films , they have an inclination of what I'm talking about . Seeing a toy with chattery teeth and legs leaping at the throat of an evil hitchhiker ( Silas Weir Mitchell ) isn't exactly something I remember seeing before so that might be novelty for those interested in the silly and weird . This anthology can be a lot of fun for undemanding viewers expecting true terror because these tales seem more geared towards chuckles than horrifying it's audience . If you enjoy Christopher Lloyd , you might enjoy his creepy storyteller , whose cracking , demented smile is memorable as those who hear his stories are effected by them .
436403	9938570	31796	6.0	The Phantom Creeps	Fans of Bela Lugosi will be certain to enjoy THE PHANTOM CREEPS , a feature film version comprised of 12 episodes of the serial regarding a determined mad scientist often staying one step ahead of those out to stop his diabolical schemes to sell a deadly radioactive meteorite , while also using it's properties to create a vast array of gadgets and weapons . Lugosi is Dr . Alex Zorka , who , along with his dim-witted nincompoop assistant , Monk ( Jack C Smith ) , has created wonderful inventions which could benefit the American government , but he is not willing to hand over his research and experiments to others , as former scientist / colleague , Dr . Fred Mallory ( Edwin Stanley ) insists . Mallory is Zorka's nemesis , a scientist who wishes to see good use from the discoveries . . but Zorka doesn't want others ' hands on his hard work , and he has built a giant metallic robot , ray gun which renders victims unconscious , a homing device which attracts a mechanical spider that , upon explosion , can leave the victim paralyzed or dead , and invisibility ( . . a little belt contains a button which causes him to vanish and reappear ) . Capt . Bob West ( Robert Kent ) and newspaper reporter , Jean Drew ( Dorothy Arnold ) are on Zorka's trail , as a manhunt is underway knowing that the diabolical scientist perhaps plans to sell his meteorite to foreign enemies or , worse even , use it's power to destroy the world . I'm pretty sure many will watch THE PHANTOM CREEPS , point at the screen , and laugh uncontrollably at the primitive effects used throughout because the filmmakers were attempting to wow the theater-goers with lots of cool methods derived from Zorka's evil and brilliant mind . . this was 1939 , so many of the effects are positively dated , but I certainly was impressed with how they make Lugosi disappear ( . . a haze is created to often display a silhouette shortly after turning invisible ) . The ray gun blasts and giant robot ( . . which is too tall , a head too large , with long arms flailing around all over the place ) are not as impressive , but I'm pretty sure the kids attending the theaters at that time in 1939 were blown away . While Lugosi lets it all hang out , without much restraint , as Zorka ( . . gleefully proclaiming to his assistant about how he'll defeat those that oppose him ) the heroes of the film are all rather bland and less interesting . Lots of stock war footage , featuring explosions , are used to swell effect at the end , as Zorka drops bombs on ships and buildings below from a plane he commandeered with Monk . For most of this film , expertly edited from the serial into a stunningly cohesive format , has Zorka cleverly evading his foes time and time again , before finally succumbing to his own destruction and madness . Dora Clement portrays Ann Zorka , the mad doctor's beloved wife , who dies in a plane crash when one of his dangerous schemes goes awry . . this motivates Zorka even more to vanquish his enemies , those he blames for her death . Fans of Browning's Dracula will get a kick out of seeing Edward Van Sloan as a corrupt spy desiring the meteorite , sending his goons to fetch it before fleeing the country in a hidden submarine . The gags involving Zorka , while invisible , are obviously produced through the use of strings moving objects ( . . quite apparently in some cases ) . Animated lightning bolts and beams are used when Zorka fires his ray gun . Again , you must have an appreciation for what filmmakers were trying to do for the young audiences attending matinées at this time . . most will find this hokey and unintentionally hilarious . One does wonder why Zorka would allow such an untrustworthy birdbrain as Monk to remain an assistant after he tries to betray him multiple times . . this unfortunate mistake costs Zorka dearly at the end when Monk wishes to bail on him as a company of planes draw near .
435944	9938570	55128	6.0	The Curse of the Crying Woman	Amelia ( Rosa Arenas ) returns to her Aunt Selma's urgent request , bringing along her new husband Jaime ( Abel Salazar ) . She has been away from her Aunt Selma ( Rita Macedo ) for quite some time and informs Jaime that the childhood she remembers wasn't a happy one . Amelia has no idea , not one single clue what horrors awaits her and Jaime . Selma is a practicing witch holding on to the moment Amelia turns 25 because this specific point and time will supposedly draw a dead ( . . but dormant ) spirit of the " Crying Woman " back from the dead . You'll hear throughout the film about what Selma longs ( . . and is assured ) to receive , her omnipotence at the sacrifice of her niece of course . Obviously , this isn't great news to Amelia , but finding out that the " Crying Woman " witch is a blood descendant sure doesn't help matters . Selma lets Amelia know right away that her blood will force her will to remove a certain spear from the rotted corpse of the witch . . when this moment happens , she'll die . If grappling with this terrifying ordeal isn't enough , Amelia and Jaime have a monstrously scarred evil brute named Juan ( Carlos López Moctezuma ) to worry with as well . Another surprise for the couple is a caged monster up the stairs just waiting to get out ! Could this monster be Daniel ( Enrique Lucero ) Selma's supposedly dead husband , horribly mutated by witchcraft ? Despite hokey make-up effects and lame dog-attack sequences , director Rafael Baledón is able to build a tense situation amongst the cob-webs , dust and madness within this creepy mansion . It has that pure Gothic effect one craves when searching for atmospheric horror . The story itself is quite gripping as it follows the seemingly inescapable situation regarding our heroine who must somehow defeat powerful forces she hasn't prepared for . The film has a terrific setting with a marvelous climactic battle between Juan and Jaime as a bell in the tower of the mansion rings so loudly , the walls begin to cave ! The real star is Rita Acedo as the demented Selma who has this cold , crazed look that never leaves her eyes . The flick has an unusual make-up effect where we often see Selma's real face where her eyes are missing with this black void filling her sockets . All hell breaks at the end in the old style of the 30's Universal horror pictures where chaos sends the setting ( . . often a castle , in this film a massive , creaky , rat-infested mansion ) into rubble , while certain characters die .
435684	9938570	67929	6.0	The Velvet Vampire	Lee & Susan Ritter ( Michael Blodgett & Sherry Miles ) , whose marriage seems shaky at best and plagued with problems , meet a mysterious and sultry woman , Diane ( Celeste Yarnall ) at an art gallery . They accept an invitation to her Mojave desert abode , and while traveling their car breaks down . While waiting for an ordered part , the Ritters remain at Diane's home . Lee succumbs to Diane's erotic advances while Susan helplessly watches her marriage dwindling . . yet , as the film continues , Susan seems to care less about her husband's adultery and even warms to Diane after a scare with a snake bite ( . . Diane sucked out the venom from Susan's leg before the poison could spread ) . Both Lee and Susan continue to have an erotically charged , surreal dream with Diane separating them from love-making in the middle of a desert . Meanwhile , Diane has her manservant Juan ( Jerry Daniels ) fetch up victims for their blood . . she's indeed an atypical vampire who can withstand amounts of sunlight ( . . although , she covers her body with lots of clothing when out in her dune buggy ) and her reflection indeed appears when looking in a mirror . Diane's daily ritual is to rest in her carefully preserved burial spot with her long dead husband ( . . through a unique Indian burial , Diane's husband's body is kept as it once was upon death ) ! Will the Ritters escape Diane's clutched before it's too late or wind up like those who once inhabited the desert countryside , now resting among the massive burial site where Diane often frequents ? Strange little vampire tale . This might have an appeal to fans of Drive-in type Midnight Movies . I think the main reasons to see it are Celeste Yarnall's seductive vampire and the desert setting which is quite an interesting backdrop creating a unique experience for the viewer used to the typical vampire locales . I think Blodgett and Miles ' couple are terribly uninteresting , I'm afraid , and nowhere near as fascinating and alluring as Yarnall , who could fit in quite well in the Euro-vampire flicks coming out at the time . Sherry Miles is atrocious as Susan , quite an irritating chick , with a great figure , who gripes and complains throughout most of this flick . Her naive bubblehead should've been killed quite sooner . . it's a stretch asking us to believe Yarnall's bloodsucker wouldn't have easy pickens with this idiot . Blodgett is merely vacating a male role for Diane to seduce . . he doesn't exude much of anything other than the horny husband whose wife isn't putting out , longing for Diane's embrace . The film might be a bit slow-moving for many . The final fifteen minutes picks up the pace considerably as Diane chases after Susan , desiring her for blood and sex . More of an interesting curiosity for vampire fans . . nothing mind-blowing , I'm afraid . This has a LOW budget , although I never found this a liability because the desert location really worked for me and the non-inhabited silence because of how Diane drank the area dry , is quite eerie . The screams from those attacked shriek a bit too loudly , though . Despite what you might hope for . . while there is nudity , the sex is mild and lesbian possibilities never reach their zenith .
436255	9938570	90327	6.0	Witchboard	An evil spirit , impersonating a little 10 year old boy David , begins taking over the body of the one who conjured him through a Ouiji board . That person , Linda ( Whitesnake babe Tawney Kitaen ) , doesn't know about the whole possession part of this and as she operates it alone begins to change . The one responsible for even introducing Linda to the board is Brandon Sinclair ( soap opera star Patch from " Days of Our Lives " fame ) , a former flame , at a party . In amongst a partner , this possession is not possible , but in the privacy of an individual it is more than reasonable it will take hold on the one in communication with the spirit world . We get our whole understanding of this through Brandon , who is atheist , but strangely believes in the spirit world probably because he found evidence . The one mostly effected other than Linda is her lover , Jim ( Todd Allen ) . Jim is very skeptical of all of the happenings . . that is until it takes place right in front of him . Friends and people he knew begin to perish and it is certain that something is killing people . In a scene-stealing role , Kathleen Wilhoite ( barely recognizable in her punk garb ) plays a very unusual medium named Zarabeth . Unlike Kevin Tenney's " Night of the Demons " , this film is straight-faced taking a more serious approach to this tale which many might find a bit cheesy . I remember when I was young that this was quite a popular horror sleeper . It is actually quite entertaining if a bit slight . Perhaps it lacks ambition , but it is polished and stylish enough to enjoy . Not great , but worth a watch . Probably near the top of the heap in the " Ouiji Board " horror sub-genre because of it's production values .
436056	9938570	81184	6.0	Meat's meat and man's gotta eat !	Vincent ( Rory Calhoun , looks like just a good ole boy , but something sinister hides under those supposed kind eyes ) has the finest , most renowned meats in the county . Everyone loves that meat . Vincent is only so glad to furnish his crowd with what they believe is ham , but they have no idea of what they are really munching down on with glee . Vincent and his large sister Ida ( Nancy Parsons ) really put a lot of work and joy into their meat business . They feel they are not only supplying their community but doing a little part for the man upstairs . Well , that secret ingredient for Vincent and Ida's renowned meat is . . human flesh ! Oh , but Vincent feels he's justifiably doing a favor for God by replenishing his customers with human meat . Ida justifies their actions by following her mantra of , " Somebody's got to take responsibility for the planet . " Vincent also feels that there's too many people in the world and not enough food . And , Vincent sure enjoys setting up traps to catch his human meat . We watch as unwary travellers driving down the wrong highway run across bear traps and shotgun bullets piercing their tires . They then take the human beings they catch , bury their bodies up to the neck in fertile soil , sever the vocal chords so that they can only gurgle without being able to cry for help , and await certain doom . If the victims are lucky , Vincent and Ida might snap their necks . One mistake Vincent makes is taking the very sexy Terry ( Nina Axelrod . . interesting name considering it might describe a situation for a lot of males as they see her rack ) into their home . . while " planting " her boyfriend , who she is told is dead and buried , in the human meat garden . Sheriff Bruce Smith ( Paul Linke ) is the black sheep of the family as he doesn't understand that his brother and sister are cooking human flesh for jerky . Will anyone stop Vincent and Ida's dastardly deeds ? This is one sick puppy . Tongue definitely in cheek . How's this for casting . . Wolfman Jack plays a reverend ! And , John Ratzenberger ( you know Cliff the mailman on Cheers ) plays a heavy metal rocker who gets planted in the meat garden ! !
436750	9938570	106449	6.0	John Carpenter Presents Body Bags	John Carpenter , as a dead man masquerading as a coroner , presents three gruesome tales from a morgue , provided with ample ammo of ghoulish zingers and sight gags . The first tale is , in my opinion , the weakest , but has many recognizable faces which add in-jokes for horror buffs to salivate over . A young woman , Anne ( Alex Datcher ) starts a gas station job and runs into trouble throughout her first night . Loose prowling Haddonfield ( hahaha ) a serial killer , who has been murdering women , might just pay Anne a visit . Anne has a sealed outpost where she remains locked in with no common way for anyone to enter unless she allows them to , yet she finds herself making trips outside when she shouldn't be . Wes Craven provides a cameo as a creepy customer , Robert Carradine ( Louis of REVENGE OF THE NERDS fame ) has an important role as a supposed gas station employee who assists Anne before she gets started , Carpenter alum Peter Jason has a amusing cameo as a lively customer , Buck Flower as . . guess what ? . . a suspicious looking bum , David Naughton ( American Werewolf in London ) as a friendly customer who forgets his credit card and might just be in the right place at the right time when Anne needs him the most , and Sam Raimi , providing a facial sight gag and . . cough . . corpse that gives this rather average slasher story an entertaining twist . The idea is that Anne is safe as long as she remains in her locked quarters and that we know that a killer is on the loose . Carpenter then plays with the concept of Anne leaving the safety of her confines , in essence toying with the viewer on when the expected confrontation will take place . The second tale is a dandy at getting under the skin ( . . hahaha , pun intended ) . Stacy Keach is perfect as a man constantly haunted by his thinning hair-line who enlists the aid of a hair-growth company through chair-man David Warner and nurse Deborah Harry who convince him to take their treatment . What Keach's Richard doesn't expect is what the long locks which sprout from his open bandages derive from . This is particularly creepy when we find out what the hairs are and where they come from . Special make-up effects master Greg Nicotero has an amusing cameo ( . . just because of his own long hair ) , & Sheena Easton ( . . yes , the singer ) is Richard's tenderhearted , but burdened girlfriend Megan who wishes he'd quit suffering about his hair-issues . The third tale is a grisly affair using " Hands of Orlac " as inspiration . Baseball player Brent Matthews ( Mark Hamill ) on the verge of escaping the minor leagues , has a serious car wreck which destroys his left eye . Through a delicate eye surgery , Dr Lang ( portrayed by horror classics vet John Agar ) restores the sight to Brent , but for a price . The new eye , from a dead psychopath who died in the gas chamber , provides unpleasant memories and killing methods Brent soon discovers . Brent becomes affected by the cruel images he sees , and the safety of pregnant wife Cathy ( Twiggy ) might be in danger . Lots of eye-violence in this particular tale . Roger Corman has a cameo as a physician who reluctantly offers Dr . Lang's assistance to Brent . Tom Arnold and Tobe Hooper pop up as the real coroners at the end with some business to take care of . . which might just have something to do with our host . Carpenter directed the first two tales himself and Tobe Hooper helmed the third . " The Eye " was my favorite , but " Hair " is probably the most original while " The Gas Station " is the most derivative . Yet , " The Gas Station " provides plenty of moments that brought a grin to my face .
436020	9938570	73461	6.0	Night of the Seagulls	Final film in the Blind Dead series features a general practitioner and his wife from the city desiring to set up a practice in a seaside village , not welcomed by the peasants who sacrifice beautiful female locals to the undead Templar knights who rip away the hearts from the victims ' chests as a sacrifice to their stone pagan god , drinking their blood afterward . This ritual occurs for seven consecutive nights so that the peasants can remain unharmed , but the doctor saves his maid-servant from being a sacrificial lamb with dangerous consequences as a result . The Templar knights , eyes still gouged , skull-faces , rotted robes , pursue those who ruined the ritual , surrounding the doctor's home , attempting to enter , with the goal of retrieving the sacrifice and killing those in the way . Victor Petit is the unwanted village doctor , Henry Stein , who only wishes to help those in need . María Kosty is his frightened wife Joan , who ( . . rightfully so ) wishes to leave the moment they arrive to immediate hostility by the rude and inhospitable locals . Sandra Mozarowsky is Lucy , the local girl they wish to protect , getting them into a heap of trouble . José Antonio Calvo is Teddy , a mistreated village idiot , often beaten by his bullying village locals , who finds sanctuary with the Steins , and is their voice into why the village behaves the way they do . The main meat of the film has these four barricading themselves in their weakly protected home as the Templar knights force their way in . I consider the undead Templar knights as creepy as ever , but question the decision making of the village people who'd remain so close to such evil , even sacrificing their own to such monsters for their own safety . That and how our heroes would remain in a village living amongst people who wish them to leave . And , the doctor's persistent desire to question the people who simply wish him to get out of their sights , with his wife in constant distress and fear . My mind boggled at his willingness to remain when warnings and signs of terror were all around him . And , when Stein does interfere , the village peasants in fact do leave throwing up the obvious thought . . why haven't they already left ? ! Why even remain in a village where evil is nearby sacrificing your own to them ? ! The home invasion and attempts at securing the building echo Night of the Living Dead . The Templar knights move slow , of course , considering their blind , but still manage to remain a major threat to much faster victims . This is more about presentation and atmosphere , which is director Ossorio's major strength as a filmmaker , than plot and characterization ( . . which have rarely been Ossorio's forte ) . I think fans will feel less bothered with my rantings regarding poor decision-making and plot contrivances because the Templar knights are so scary , marching towards their prey at night , swords in hand , threatening the lives of hapless victims who could not escape . Terrific Spanish location works wonders and Ossorio uses it effectively . The Templar leader plunges a dagger into the chests of the chosen female sacrifice . The seagulls , which cry at night , are said to be the spirits of those victims sacrificed by the Templar knights . Odd scenes of crawling crabs working their way towards dead female corpses left to rot by the Templar knights . And , as has been the case in previous entries in this series , the undead knights often ride horseback ( . . Ossorio shoots the knights on their horses pursuing their victims in slow motion , and we are treated to another sequence where the zombies rise from their tombs ) .
436251	9938570	80931	6.0	Nightmare City	A plane lands at the airport of a big city unleashing hideously disfigured ( some hilarious make-up work ) , fast-moving , and intelligent " zombies " as they strike innocents with a quickened fury , drinking their blood and munching on their flesh . They seem to be unstoppable with no true goal , but to slice and dice . They use weapons and seem to have some sort of agenda as they attack military outposts , hospitals , etc . The film follows a slight few crusaders such as news-reporter Hugo Stiglitz and his doctor-wife Laura Trotter , and those military minds , Francisco Rabal & Miguel Ferrer who are trying to defend their lives and the society against the evil , hardworking " zombies " as they begin to swiftly decimate an entire city's civilization . The film is quite stylish and breathlessly paced by Lenzi . The film doesn't exactly garner inspired performances or decent dubbing , but seems to add to the mindless fun . The effects are gruesome and inspired , but the enthusiastic camera-work and fresh breed of zombie killer certainly brings this up a notch . It is not for the squeamish as one woman gets one of breasts removed by a machete , one woman gets a spike inserted in her eye , many receive knife-stabs to their torso . The film shows limited defense against the " zombies " other than they die when blood isn't added to their appetite . I think the film provides a minor ecological element giving these zombies an excuse to exist , but this film has no story other than these once-human monsters attack and kill innocents . . that and the gore that derives from their vicious behavior . I think the apocalyptic doom attached to the city's decimation really works actually because Lenzi has this great ability at showing bodies stretched all over the place . . we see the wreckage of such an unexpected attack with no opportunity to plan escape . The film's decision to allow zombies to actually operate as humans is cheesy and the way Lenzi's camera closes in on them provides many unintentional belly-laughs .
436671	9938570	280969	6.0	My Little Eye	Five young adults from various backgrounds accept an invitation to star in a reality show for a hefty sum if they , as a collective , can remain together for a specific length of time . What they do not know is that they are actually part of a secret internet based " snuff-game " recorded for wealthy clients betting on who will survive to the end . Also , one amongst the group isn't the innocent he / she appears to be . . Gimmicky concept was kind of hip around the late 90's / early millennium thanks to " camera films " like " The Last Broadcast " and " The Bliar Witch Project . " I found " My LIttle Eye " entertaining , with how the group slowly comes apart at the seams as unpredictable occurrences begin to unravel the group . Those mysterious masterminds who have created this reality show with their mice trapped in a maze as voyeuristic eyes gaze on them from their computer monitors , a select few with the financial means and morbid taste for this kind of " entertainment . " Essentially these five people are mice , with cameras hidden everywhere , from shower heads to ball point pens . There are no avenues of escape from prying eyes , even in their supposed " reality safe zone " where cameras are not supposed to intrude , the subjects of this game find no breaks . I think the idea of having the whole film shot through hidden cameras rather ingenious , and commend the filmmakers for what had to be a difficult process , particularly in the editing room . Pretty sure a lot of footage was shot , from various angles often on one particular person . I'm not sure the climax , where a policeman shows up as the killer is after the " final girl " , actually works , but overall I found this horror spoof of reality television rather satisfying . Others may not . The acting and characters are adequate , but I think the gimmick is the showcase here . . and this may very well be what turns many away .
436962	9938570	82812	6.0	Night School	Someone , dressed in black helmet , jacket and pants , is attacking students who attend the anthropology class of Professor Millet , an established womanizer bedding his students under the nose of his girlfriend Eleanor Adjai ( Rachel Ward , lovely , but lacking in performance , having trouble with the dialogue under her thick accent ) . The killer uses a curving knife as a decapitation device , leaving the severed heads in liquid , whether it be bucket , pond or aquarium . It's up to Harvard grad lieutenant Judd Austin ( Leonard Mann ) to find the killer , who leaves little-to-no trace of evidence , except the unorthodox methods of the crime scene . Okay psycho-thriller benefits from Fiedel's terrific score which is , at times , melodic , menacing & piercing . The music provides the director , along with his moody neo-noir photography of the city streets at night as the killer stalks his / her prey , to build good suspense even if the pay-off is less satisfying . The twist isn't much of one if the viewer is paying the least bit of attention . A certain waitress in a bar , for instance . . who would kill her in such a fashion ? Or , the method of execution on those who attended the class of Professor Millet . . who'd have a reason to use such a method and why place the heads in liquid ? You even get an answer towards the end , so the reveal leaves little impact . A good twist can work wonders , but this film suffers because of that , I felt . The film also is lacking in delivering really strong attacks , an essential ingredient in the slasher genre for which this belongs . We see the biker-outfitted psychopath , with his / her curving blade , slice at the victims , whose face displays the horror they find themselves with blood spread across walls , but nothing is ever elaborated , and practically everything happens off-screen . There are some moments of depraved kink such as a tribal sex sequence between Eleanor and Millet using bits of meat and blood while bathing . And , it's sleazy . . the lifestyle of Millet who sleeps with his female students or the night school's lesbian superintendent who attempts to seduce a conquest of her teacher's before the killer interrupts . The decapitated heads are hinted at , some discovered by surprised folks like citizens who find the severed head of an employee in a fish aquarium , or the bar owner noticing his waitress ' head in the sink , immersed in water . The film , typical of both giallo thrillers and 80's slashers has a a couple of red herrings , such as a peeping tom who works as a garbage man at the local tavern which yields the murdered waitress and Professor Millet himself ( . . for he's quite the authority in tribal customs and methods ) . There's a stab of black comedy at the very end regarding the lieutenant , who is the only one who knows who the true killer is yet can not prove it , and someone behind the seat of his car , which finishes this with a nice , tasteless touch . I think the low IMDb score is ridiculous . This may not be a shining example of cinematic grace , but it's got some fine elements that deserve better than a .
435967	9938570	852726	7.0	Nightmare Detective .	A socially inert , icy detective , Keiko Kirishima ( Hitomi ) working on her first assignment , recently , by request , sent to the streets after working at a desk , finds the task of finding the mystery behind a rash of mysterious suicides quite demanding . It seems that those who commit suicide , in such a gruesome manner with whatever sharp object is available to them , are in a state of nightmarish sleep influenced by another to enact destruction upon themselves . Seeing that these aren't ordinary investigations , Keiko and partner Wakamiya ( Masanobu Ando ) are to find a psychic of some sort who can aid them in uncovering the predator who preys on victims with a suicidal desire to end their sad , seemingly unimportant lives in a crappy world . It seems that the dead victims , under suspicious means , communicated with someone merely identifying himself as O ( . . director Shinya Tsukamoto , in another one of his many strange supporting roles ) . O , it seems , somehow hypnotically controls those on the opposite end of the phone and Keiko decides that she'll need the help of an infamous " nightmare detective " ( Ryuhei Matsuda ) who can enter dreams to assist those under duress by whatever is plaguing the restless sleep of victims . Keiko will voluntarily call O in a desperate attempt to stop his murderous reign , facing the horrifying consequences as he exposes her own mental / emotional problems . Despite a reluctant resistance & fear , the nightmare detective will assist Keiko in trying to find and stop O . Part police procedural , part psychological thriller , with a little Nightmare on Elm Street mixed in , leave it to director Tsukamoto to make it all come together . Like the best psychological thrillers , we get an understanding as to why the killer is committing such evil deeds , and the frailties of those whose job it is to catch them . Through the killer , the emotionally fragile detective ( . . and our nightmare detective ) faces the inner demons that haunt her . In other words , through the ordeal of this killer invading her vulnerable dream state , she must find strength with the help of her telepathic avenger , the only one who can truly stop the madman , to face the knife-wielding hunk of monstrous flesh which briskly moves at it's victims . We also see through the eyes of our nightmare detective . . the inner thoughts of others which yield ugly revelations , the dream of a catatonic he's supposed to save , how he " travels " into the dreams of others , and how he indeed can alter the path of the killer ( . . first stopping it momentarily from attacking Wakamiya who calls O with tragic results , and how he assists Keiko whose seemingly trapped in an enclosed room with little wiggle-room to move ) with possible harm / death to himself . We also see what happens to several victims who communicate with O and the nightmarish plane for which he operates and the grisly , bloody results . And , indeed we get a showdown between the nightmare detective and the killer as we learn what may've formed them into the men they've become . My only real complaint was the camera work which is the newly adopted steady-cam style where everything's always moving frantically . AS with most of Tsukamoto's work , this could be a bit difficult and challenging for many viewers . I think the most present theme in the film is the will to live when life seems the most empty , and the terrain explored of why we are the way we are and the certain situations from the past that have shaped us into the human beings we have become . The three main leads , the emotionally vacant Keiko , the numb & sad nightmare detective tired of a gift which has been more of a burden , and the killer whose hunger for human flesh ( . . the monster that represents him in the nightmares that entreat upon victims , " assisting " them in an act they supposedly desired to commit ) derives from a desire to at first die by his own hand due to a horrifying traumatic experience as a child ( . . seeing this in a flashback when the nightmare detective " opens " his mind , which also answers the mysterious girl's voice asking for help ) leads to the deaths of many who were to kill themselves with him in a suicide pact across the phone . SPOILER : This could very well be the first time I've seen a killer actually murder others with a cell phone in a catatonic state
436954	9938570	451102	7.0	Jack Ketcham's The Lost	Ray Pyke ( Marc Senter ) is a narcissistic developing psychopath , whose volatile nature is sure to eventually meet a crescendo of violence as his drug habit and infantile fits of rage represent a volcano on it's way to eruption . Ray's friend Tim ( Alex Frost ) and girlfriend Jen ( Shay Astar ) bare witness to his gunning down two girls camping out , and must carry such a burden out of fear for their safety ( . . that , and Ray has a control over them ) . This depraved act of violence works as a reminder to us that Ray is a ticking timebomb , as we watch his life slowly spiral out of control as Detective Charlie Schilling ( Michael Bowen ) hounds him over the murders , knowing that he's the one responsible , just without proof . Ray is the kind of dirtbag who dresses like a country stud , with boots ( . . with crushed bear cans to make him look taller ) , black jeans and shirt ( . . with additional slight touches of eyeliner ) & hair slicked back right in place . Sparta , as we soon realize , is a small blot in Texas where dreams are elsewhere and the pretty girls who live in this place have few options in regards to male suitors so Ray is one they flock to . He's merely an assistant manager of his mom's " Bates Motel " , but carries himself as if he ruled the world . Just charismatic enough to attract the local female , but it's merely an endless parade of humping and dumping , with the girls returning because there's nobody else it seems . Three particular female characters which have the misfortune to have ever found themselves locked into Ray's radar are Sally Richmond ( Alice Hirson ) , a young woman , temporarily working as a maid for his hotel , who wants nothing at all to do with him , recognizing the kind of sleazoid he really is ( . . that , and she is involved with a 60 year old retired detective portrayed by screen vet Ed Lauter ) , Kat Wallace ( Robin Sydney ) , a wealthy babe , her mom a schizophrenic , whose obviously attracted to the danger and mystery he presents ( . . that , and she's bored and craving excitement ) , not knowing how obsessive and juvenile he really is , and , of course , Jen who would do anything to please him , always on the receiving end of neglect , ridicule . , and abuse . Somewhat holding himself together , while abusing drugs and liquor , it's only an amount of time before Ray snaps . The fuse is lit by Katherine who Ray longs for in every possible way , as she backs away from a possible relationship . . it's realized that Ray was a fling for her , and she wishes to move on with her life . Also adding to this is the discovery that Tim and Jen have slept together ( . . and that Tim has been taking hash from him ) . We have come to the understanding that Ray's sanity is hanging by a thread and it won't require much for him to crack . Sivertson's disturbing portrait of decaying youth bent on destruction , given commanding treatment thanks to how developed the story is , and how it will end . Ray is the kind of character just looking for an excuse to terrorize somebody , and Senter does a good job of displaying the many facets of his troubled character . . someone attracted to the spotlight , addicted to a neverending stream of girls and drugs , also carrying serious homicidal tendencies , whose anger fits and outbursts serve as a warning of things to come . Robin Sydney is quite a find , a stunning bombshell whose quite photogenic and seductive ( . . the camera loves her ) . . you can see how such a gal would cause Ray ( . . or many a man ) to get all out of sorts . Astar is appropriately pathetic , and sympathetic as Ray's much maligned squeeze , deeply in love with him no matter how emotionally he abuses her . . Ray doesn't even hide his sexual excess from her , yet Jen remains loyal to him . Frost is the buddy who probably wishes to be Ray , to have the girls at his feet , the charisma to approach people the way he does . This setting is rather depressing in that we see a cast of characters with little to do but embrace the drug and sex culture available . Ray's fury at the end is rather unsettling and shocking , once he decides to go on a shooting rampage , killing anyone he so chooses ( . . this has been on the horizon for some time , and Kat's rejection of him finally sends him over the edge ) , gathering up the girls who infuriated him the most . We also follow Schilling's dogged determination and on-going interrogation to bring Ray to justice , getting what he has so longed for with the unfortunate price of lives . Sivertson's skills as a visual filmmaker are proved here ( . . and in I KNOW WHO KILLED ME , although that one is ridiculously convoluted and silly ) with how he captures the events and characters , building them to the eventual climax . Carefully , Sivertson details what will bring Ray to the breaking point , and those characters who are effected by his rage . The climax takes place in the cabin where Ray discovered the guns used on innocent people , and is appropriately chilling , as he collects the girls who caused his psychological trauma together . . completely unglued , Ray has become lost to madness ( even besieging a couple there to clean up the place ; his violence towards them is truly unpleasant , to say the least ) as Schilling grills Tim for his whereabouts .
436359	9938570	68458	7.0	Raw Meat	Devious little nasty nugget about a cannibal in the abandoned " rabbit warren " Underground tunnels who has started to surface into the public subways for walking human meat , those unfortunate souls who happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time . When a certain wealthy aristocrat , with a penchant for kink and sleaze , comes up missing , a couple who were the last to see him alive , Alex ( David Ladd ) and Patricia Wilson ( Sharon Gurney ) go to Inspector Calhoun ( Donald Pleasence in a terrific role cracking wise with witty , very funny , acid-tongued crudely delivered dialogue , often aimed at his always-smiling detective Rogers , played by Norman Rossington as if he's just able to keep from bursting into laughter while often firing right back at his boss ) hoping someone can help him . Patricia is a kind soul who found the man laid over the steps of the station in incredible fright . When she and Alex find a copper to assist the man , believing his either drunk or sick , they are shocked to find his body gone . We find deep in the inner-workings of a darkly lit tunnels , the cannibal ( Hugh Armstrong ) with his lady-love ( June Turner ) on her deathbed as he weeps mournfully over her . In a long camera-shot , we see his lair as body parts lay throughout with partially eaten corpses hanging on the wall . When she dies , the cannibal , with nasty infected wounds showing signs of the septicemic plague he's contracted from rats , seeks out a mate and kidnaps Patricia ! With Alex in a frenzied state of panic , he informs Calhoun and takes off into the dark tunnels seeking his lover no matter what harm might befall him . Meanwhile , Calhoun and Richardson themselves will pursue their suspect in a desperate search for the missing aristocrat's body hoping to stop the killing . Delicious ( pun intended ) macabre tale with a demented sense of humor and creepy photography inside the killer's lair . Often also quite disgusting when showing the killer's unfinished lunch , not to mention , all the sores throughout his diseased body . The script gives Pleasence lots of sharply written barbs to fire at people with a nice touch regarding his tea , delivered to him also accompanying the bag still in it . The cannibal can only say one sentence , he repeats add nauseum , proclaiming to Patricia as he chases her in the tunnels when she's able to flee his grasp , " Mind the doors . " Christopher Lee has a minor , but effective , cameo as a MI 5 agent who has told Calhoun to stay away from the case of the aristocrat ( who seems to have been committing naughty deeds against his government ) or else .
436767	9938570	64725	7.0	Night Gallery	In " The Cemetery " ( . . directed by Boris Sagal ) , a loathsome money-hungry nephew , Jeremy Evans ( Roddy McDowell , playing him as a really slimy scumbag ) ready and willing to horde on his Uncle's inheritance , just waiting for the old timer , William Hendricks ( George Macready ) crippled and ravaged by a stroke that has taken his means of movement and communication , to croak . His Uncle was once a painter obsessed with death . . his works often evoke that . Osmond Portifoy ( Ossie Davis ) has been under employ to the old man for many years and Jeremy relishes in reminding the butler who will be dipping their hands in the money jar . To show you just how virulent Jeremy can be , he points out to Portifoy ( . . and for extra slander , he uses " Portifoy " nearly every sentence with a sneer ) how his mother worked her fingers to the bone without ever asking Uncle for a dime and that he always desired to live the good life , but needed the means to do so . McDowell is in command carrying this heavy smell of pomp and greed ( " I'm a black sheep nephew with an itch " ) . . you just love to hate him . Jeremy finds out that he'll receive his Uncle's inheritance due to the fact that his mother is dead and her share will go to him thanks to a clause in Hendrick's will . So Jeremy locks his Uncle's wheelchair next to an open window allowing the draft to kill him ( . . while also letting his Uncle peer at the family graveyard as a reminder of where the old man is about be heading ) . Oh , but you know Jeremy's got his comeuppance coming to him , yes sir ! Jeremy notices a painting on the wall ( Hendrick's portraits line the wall of the stairwell ) and the freshly dug grave where dear dead Uncle was buried begins to change every time he looks at it . Watch as Jeremy slowly unravels as he sees Uncle's casket appear , then open , then show someone rising slowly walking to the front door of the manor . But , all is not what it seems . I do think McDowell's tour-de-force performance approaches high camp but I just enjoyed it immensely . . he's such a blood-sucking leech , a real weasel . Watching Jeremy squirm and ultimately become frightened out of his wits was a ton of fun . The ending is a bit silly ( . . and rather logically unsound ) , pointing out another schemer out for a payday , but overall I think it's fun , if derivative somewhat . The idea of the ever-changing portrait is a cool idea , I thought . The second tale , " Eyes " ( . . directed by Steven Spielberg ) stars Joan Crawford as an acid-tongued , rich , blind woman , Claudia ( who has built her own apartment complex in New York and lives as it's only tenant ) , who blackmails a surgeon , Dr . Frank Heatherton ( Barry Sullivan ) into performing a dangerous and unorthodox grafting procedure transplanting the central optic nerves of an obsessive gambler's eyes , Sidney ( Tom Bosley of " Happy Days " fame ) needing 9 grand to pay off a debt from a bookie threatening his life . Although the procedure will only grant her 11 hours of sight , she's willing to have that for just the precious moments to see color and objects always darkened to her . But , in a nasty bit of irony to match her own behavior towards others like Heatherton , New York City goes through a black out ridding her of those precious moments she has so longed for . This tale has that Rod Serling intellectual banter between characters you remember from stage-like episodes of " Twilight Zone " as fates are contemplated and discussions are batted around . This also has the " coming out " stylistics of a future filmmaker . The third tale , " The Escape Route " ( . . directed by Barry Shear ) follows a Nazi named Strobe ( Richard Kiley , with a scar covering one eye for extra impact ) hiding away in South Africa , haunted by memories of his war crimes and constantly looking over his shoulder worried about being caught by agents who specialize in hunting " his kind " out . He becomes pre-occupied / transfixed with a museum painting of some fisherman on a mountain lake . . his desire is to enter the painting as a means of escape from the torments of running . He tries to shake an old Jew , Bleum ( the marvelous Sam Jaffe , whose frail , wrinkled body , offers a terrifying example of what torture , imprisonment & death can do to one who had seen it all ) who seems to recognize him . A creepy crucifixion painting depicting one's suffering leads us into Strobe and Bleum's first meeting . . and , for a reason you'll find later , is as important to this tale as the fisherman painting . A chilling exploration of a tired monster with few escape routes whose wish is granted . . just not the way he thinks . As expected ( considering the title ) each episode features within it's plot the importance of a portrait . All three tales bear Rod Serling's distinctive writing style with the usual " gotcha ! " twisting irony one grows to expect . I guess the first one is closest to the " Night Gallery " series , but this film is much better than what comes after it because of Serling's strong involvement in every tale presented . He is also the host introducing us to each macabre tale .
435779	9938570	92076	7.0	The saw is what we live by .	A direct reverse of the original , this sequel is a comedy ( albeit a twisted one ) masquerading as a horror film . There's never really a moment where you experience true horror . This film , thanks to a much larger budget , is too polished to get under the skin ( . . unless you are easily offended by cannibal jokes ) . I don't recall one genuine moment that haunts you or even scare you . Despite what happens to heroine Williams , you never feel like she'll not survive . Several of those key ingredients this film lacks is what gave the original it's punch and long-lasting status as a film that must be experienced by every horror fan . The film really boasts having Hopper in it . . though , to be honest , he's coasting here . It's Williams who gets the camera time . . well , her and Leatherface ( . . which can be a good and bad thing ) . Leatherface has all the aura of terror stripped from him here and he's more of a laughing-stock . His brothers torment him and we get an understanding of why he's so strange . The film has a tour-de-nuts performance from Moseley as the brother with a silver plate on his skull ( . . to add dimension , he often takes a hanger and peels off dead skin from his head , around the silver dome , to munch on ) and tendency to use a dead corpse as a puppet to speak through . Poor Williams just gets a raw deal as she tries being heroic , going to ex-Texas ranger Hopper with a recorded taping of a murder by Leatherface and Moseley of two college partiers . Hopper seeks vengeance for the murder of a relative at the hands of the Sawyer family . Using poor Williams , he finds their creepy lair . . an abandoned amusement park . Williams goes through pretty much the same as the original version's heroine . Her head is stuck over a bucket for great grandpa to beat over with a hammer . She gets her own friend's skinned face placed on there by Leatherface . . and is made to dance with him ! She has to fight through all kinds of hell to escape their lair after falling through a hole in the ground . This film is loaded with gore , lots of chainsaw stabbings ( . . we see Leatherface's guts hanging out as Hopper hacks away with his own chainsaw ) , and demented humor . It's overkill , but the blasted movie is so enthusiastic and over-the-top , the sequel becomes entertaining within all the madness .
436207	9938570	76731	7.0	Snowbeast	Rills ski lodge's Winter Carnival faces a major crisis . . the tourist festivities , including the Snow Queen Pageant , have been interrupted by a carnivorous Yeti on the prowl for humans to munch . It'll be up to Tony Rill ( Robert Logan ) , director of operations with grandma Rill ( . . veteran actress Sylvia Sidney ) over the lodge , newly employed Olympiad skier Gar ( Bo Svenson ) scarred by recent failures at living up to his past successes at his profession along with estranged news reporter wife Ellen ( . . the absolutely stunning Yvette Mimieux ) , and Sheriff Paraday ( Clint Walker ) to catch and kill the snow creature terrorizing the slopes and mountain wilderness near the lodge . I think this film will be more of a treat for Sasquatch / Yeti movie aficionados than the average horror fan . This is every bit the television movie ( . . back when television movies were all the rage before cable became such a presence ) with the film at times pinpointing the complications of Gar and Ellen's failing marriage and how the perilous situation at hand brings them closer than ever before . There are no Yeti gore attacks , with this film often showing a white furry arm with sharp claws either grabbing victim's heads or coming towards potential innocents as the screen merely fades into blood red at obvious commercial breaks ( . . the blood red screen fade outs were a nice little visual trick I enjoyed ) . I think what truly enhances this particular Yeti monster movie is the incredibly gorgeous Colorado locations with director Herb Wallerstein and expert cinematographer Frank Stanley ( The Eiger Sanction ; Thunderbolt and Lightfoot ) often focusing on how the sun shines over the mountainous landscape with the snow traveling with the wind . . the idea that such an ideal picturesque place could harbor such a predatory beast is , in my opinion , this little movie's greatest strength . It helps when a television director has such a gifted camera-operator because Stanley is used a great deal with Wallerstein almost completely depending on point-of-view shots with the snow creature spying on potential victims through trees , establishing the beast's presence with it's arm often moving branches out of the way ( . . the creature's presence is also signified by it's intense growl , increasing in noise when it draws closer to lunch meat ) . I think many will find " Snowbeast " tedious viewing because of the melodramatics regarding the Sebergs and a slow-moving approach gradually developing towards the climactic showdown between Svenson's Gar and the snowbeast after it causes an avalanche of logs which tip over their RV ( . . trapping the poor sheriff ) . Following the wake of the Spielbergian juggernaut JAWS , many films thereafter would feature an authoritative figure ( . . in this film , the sweet-hearted elder Sidney ) wanting the knowledge of a potential monstrous threat ( . . instead of the shark , this film's is the Yeti ) held in quiet out of fear that tourism would be drastically effected ( . . instead of the Amity beach , this film is set in the Colorado ski lodge ) , only to face the horrifying consequences ( . . the beast attacks during the pageant with tourists running for their lives in fright ) . Solid cast also boosts this obscure creature feature .
435969	9938570	58466	7.0	Phantom of Soho	Slick Bryan Edgar Wallace mystery set in the seedy Soho district of London ( . . filmed in Berlin ; part of Germany's successful Krimi crime genre , which resembles Italy's giallo ) where a killer wearing golden gloves , black robe , and skull mask ( . . the latter is revealed at the end ) is stalking and stabbing a group of questionable aristocratic individuals who populate at a strip club known as Zanzibar , and are caught off guard by the killer when they are most vulnerable . Obviously the killer must be found and who better to do so than the finest at Scotland Yard , led by Chief Inspector Patton ( Dieter Borsche ) and his lieutenant , Sergeant Hallam ( Peter Vogel ) answering to Sir Phillip ( Hans Söhnker ) . A successful crime novelist , Clarinda Smith ( Barbara Rütting ) , quite the opportunist , seeks to join the investigators , betting she could solve the mystery before they can . Each individual murdered seem tied together somehow , and the killer leaves a manila envelope ( . . with different types of currency , and a golden cigar case by one ) at each crime scene . Patton and Hallam must determine the motive and why these certain individuals are selected for execution . It all ties to the Zanzibar strip club and the wheel-chair bound owner of the establishment , Joanna Gilyard ( Stanislav Ledinek ) . Always by her side is Dr . Dalmer ( Werner Peters ) , an established physician , known to care for wealthy clientèle . Patton and Hallam notice a rather ominous looking fellow hanging around Zanzibar , often hiding behind objects to spy on them , a visible birthmark around his eye , making him a recognizable figure , Wilhelm Grover ( Otto Waldis ) . . he himself gets involved when Patton's on his way to discovering a truth about the killer . Another character who soon adds extra weight to an already difficult case is a bar photographer , Corinne ( Helga Sommerfeld ) whose job catches incriminating pictures of political and important figures in England . . she may hold an answer herself in what is going on regarding the identity of the killer . And , another suspicious character arises , a blackmailing sailor , Captain Muggins ( Hans W Hamacher ) who threatens to expose information regarding a sunken ship and insurance fraud which certain people don't want published . Like any good mystery , Franz Josef Gottlieb's PHANTOM OF SOHO , follows the detectives on their pursuit of the killer , adding up the clues as characters are bumped off , tying up the loose ends as the complicated plot unfolds . If you follow behavior and how Gottlieb's camera sometimes casts doubt by pointing out faces during key moments of dialogue , you might just figure out who the killer is even if motive isn't clearly established until the end . Like many popular Giallo , this Krimi mystery is effectively stylish ( . . and atmospheric in the Gothic tradition ) and even lurid at times ( . . since this is German produced , you even see dancers expose their breasts while stripping for on-lookers in the Zanzibar club ) featuring devious characters with sordid pasts . And , at the heart of the story is a bona fide revenge angle for a very unjust act towards an innocent victim seeking retribution . Gottlieb's style is rather flashy , shooting characters from unusual ( . . but effective ) angles , and the convoluted story is handled with expert skill . I recommend PHANTOM OF SOHO to fans of the Giallo , while it does lack the beautiful men & women wearing glamorous fashions , the gratuitous violence and sex / nudity associated with the popular Italian sub-genre , this Krimi mystery establishes the familiar framework the audience is accustomed to . . unscrupulous characters with amorous appetites , dying at the hands of the killer , for a certain cause not yet established , the executions shot in a specific way ( . . the POV camera is the eyes of the killer as the gloved hands , one with the established knife , peer from the sides of the screen , confronting a frightened victim who is frozen from shock , stabbed in the heart , with the envelope planted either under the victim's hands or between their fingers ) , as the detectives solve the mystery . The colorful cast help matters immensely as does the intriguing plot ( . . and how it's designed ) . . I expect many will undoubtedly find such a film " old and boring " , but fans of mysteries might like it .

Somehow Jackson and the flight attendants must find the means to keep those on board safe and kill the snakes that are threatening their lives , not to mention another unfortunate dilemma facing them . . both pilots are bitten by snakes and someone else will have to land the plane ! A disaster movie with CGI snakes that attack a bunch of folks on board a plane with Sammy L working his usual cool / charisma . You are most certainly confident that he'll find a way to save as many as possible . The snakes bite into a breast nipple , eyeball , penis , throats , buttock , faces , leaving some nasty after-effects such as sores and mouth-foaming . A dog and man are victims of a massive python which wraps around and chokes them before the feeding occurs ( . . the dog's fate isn't elaborated , although the film shows the python swallowing the male victim's head ! ) Fun supporting cast add color to the proceedings . Like in a lot of disaster films , we are introduced to the supporting characters before the perilous situation takes place with the release of the snakes which are ultimately antagonized by the pheromones of leis flowers . Featuring characters that mimic cultural archetypes such as Rachel Blanchard as a Paris Hilton wannabe with a dog , IPOD , and Valley Girl looks ( . . her name is Mercedes ) and rap star Three G's ( Flex Alexander ) who is a cocky germaphobe with attitude . Lin Shaye has a wonderful role as flight attendant on her last tour , Grace ( . . one knows her fate when she mentions how she plans to retire after this one last flight ) . Julianna Margulies is flight attendant Claire , who plans to become a lawyer after this last flight , and is called upon to help Sammy L's agent Neville Flynn , when the going gets rough . Kenan Thompson lends his usual funny expressions to the character of Troy , Three G's entourage and high school chum who looks out for him and is asked to land the plane based solely on his video-game expertise ! The computer generated snakes aren't always that convincing , although that's part of the movie's charm . Fast-paced thrill-ride that aims to please . The absurd premise just draws you in and it's up to the filmmakers to sell such an idea as passengers joining together to find a way out of such a difficult situation through a variety of ways . . you must take a leap of faith when you see Sammy L killing snakes with a taser gun !
435728	9938570	49103	7.0	The Creature Walks Among Us	" . . we all stand between the jungle and the stars , at a crossroads . I think we better decide what brings out the best in humankind , and what brings out the worst , because it's the stars or the jungle . " Seeking the Gill Man for scientific study , Dr . William Barton ( Jeff Morrow ) and geneticist Dr . Thomas Morgan ( the dashing Rex Reason ) are on an expedition in the Everglades hoping to find it with skipper Jed Grant ( Gregg Palmer ) operating the boat . Along for the ride is Barton's stunningly beautiful wife Marcia ( Leigh Snowden who is quite the eye-candy these Gill Man movies are accustomed to ) . Barton's a brilliant scientist , but crippled with jealousy . . obsessed so that he's eaten to the pits when he sees any man even near her . This jealousy , at times , overwhelms him with uncontrollable rage . Meanwhile , the crew ( which includes other scientists aiding Barton and Morgan including a sonar specialist who can track aquatic life underwater ) eventually find the Gill Man , but he's not easy to capture and corners them into anchoring when the channel they travel comes to land . In a smaller boat , the Gill Man attacks them as they are pursuing it , accidentally covering himself with gasoline . Scared , skipper Grant sets the Gill Man on fire nearly killing it . Wrapped heavily in bandages , the Gill Man is losing oxygen as Barton and Morgan try to save it from certain death . Noticing unused lungs , they decide to open them through a surgical procedure converting the Gill Man from fish to amphibian to mammal with the result being an increase in metabolism perhaps offering a rapid case of evolution in a small period of time . Now breathing on it's own , Barton and Morgan notice that the Gill Man's outer scales were burned away in the mishap of fire and that a layer of human skin is underneath . . this shows an increase in it's sensitivity to pain . The Gill Man is made a special suit for the loss of his stronger scales . Once ashore in San Francisco , Barton's behavior regarding his wife worsens as he notices Grant's aggressive advances towards Marcia . He can not shake the idea that his wife would eventually leave him and this causes a nasty streak that will lead to the murder of Grant while the Gill Man , adapting to his new system of life caged near the plantation they work and live , watches it take place . Barton tries to frame the Gill Man , but it tears from the cage going berserk . The introduction of murder between one man against another ( . . and perhaps it's own carnal lust for Marcia , often shown eyeing her from below ) seems to have effected the Gill Man greatly as it chases after Barton who shoots his gun towards the creature . Ripping through the plantation , the Gill Man will blaze a path hunting Barton while others try to somehow survive the carnage . Quite underrated Universal sequel to " Creature from the Black Lagoon " suffers only from a rather rushed resolution . I think the set-up of the film is quite intelligent and the debates between Barton and Morgan are quite fascinating . Barton wishes to pursue greater heights since seeing how to convert a sea animal to a land mammal , but Morgan believes they should take things slow , gradually understanding the Gill Man more before leaping into the ideas of increasing metabolism in " changing man " . We also understand early on that the Gill Man suffered a disconnected thought process due to a lack of oxygen to the brain for nearly an hour which may've caused permanent damage so this might explain why it reacts so violently towards the end . But , through it all , Morgan believes Barton was actually the real monster whose demons bested him and that the Gill Man had not reverted back to what it was . . but that it was just protecting itself against a predator ( we see that before Barton tried to kill him after the witnessing his murder of Grant that the Gill Man killed a bobcat which had entered it's cage killing a couple sheep ) . I thought the boat attack towards the beginning . . and the climactic rampage through the plantation . . were quite thrilling . Good cast , too . Only if the screenplay had been a little stronger opting to focus on the troubled marriage of William and Marcia instead of the evolving Gill Man on land .
436215	9938570	119784	7.0	The Night Flier	I have to say one of my choices as a horror sleeper from the 90's is this little creepy grisly effort from director Mark Pavia , based on a Stephen King story , regarding a narcissistic , manipulative , and ultimately vicious tabloid reporter who'll stoop to the lowest level to keep his story on the front page , meeting his match when he begins tailing a vampire killer flying a black Cessna plane who hypnotizes victims around plane air strips throughout Northeastern United States , the rural routes of small town America . At the bottom of his plane is maggot-filled earth , and inside , smeared throughout the controls is dried blood , collected over the his time of mutilation and death . Julie Entwisle , just a bubbly , high-spirited cutie presented as the perfect little fish to be devoured by Miguel Ferrer's cunning shark , tries to forge her way into the tabloid's upper tier , starting from the bottom with a key ability to get forms of information difficult to reach for the paper's top piranha . Anyway , we see as he flies in his own plane from destination to destination , Ferrer's Richard Dees working through the first murder sites , gathering bits and pieces from whatever he can find , through testimony and bribing coroners for photos of mutilated victims . We also get a chance to see his ways of flamboyant journalism by disturbing a victim's grave , adding ugly dead flowers and his own blood ( . . while even stooping so low as to move the gravestone ) . . everything is for getting the top story printed with extra spice . I think the idea of the main character being a real slimeball could hurt the film for many because it's much easier to cast a likable hero who we feel sympathy for as he / she pursues the killer leaving a graphic trail of gruesome murders , with throats ripped open so badly that the head is pulled apart from the neck displaying bloody flesh . There's even one scene where the head is ripped completely from the body , placed in an appropriate area as to show those who investigate that the vampire can operate without restraint almost teasing the authorities to catch him . The opening kill shows long gashes down a male victim's face . . good , gory carnage is left in this vampire's wake . The closing sequence is one that receives mixed reaction . I've read from some who love it , believing it's the most effective portion of the movie , while others believe it's the most harmful . I particularly love the scene where we have Dees , after finally becoming sickened by the airport lobby slaughter by the vampire , watching from the mirror as the invisible count takes a leak , with the urine being blood red . . haha , nice touch . The B & W portion where Dees confronts victims , dressed as vampires , as the count allows him to see what it's like from the other side , I thought was a nifty little moment of nightmarish power . I think we have been spoiled rotten by DVD special features , given access into the movie-making behind-the-scenes effects process . For some , the practical effects of gore , displaying the killer's grisly methods , will receive less of an impact , but I enjoyed them even though I know how they are brought to life ( . . I think for some , the nasty open wounds from the vampire's finger nails look less effective , and we can understand how they were created ) . I think the casting of Ferrer is ideal just because of the type of character he portrays . He indeed has a taste for bloody carnage and the vampire , through the final climactic sequence , first seeing the wake of violence of an entire group of people awaiting a trip to some unknown destination , and the B @ W vision through a taste of the killer's blood , gives him an opportunity to experience just that . The audience does get what they crave , this bastard's comeuppance . He wanted that front page and gets it , but this time , Entwisle's young reporter ( . . who gets shafted by Dees ) benefits . It's a fitting conclusion , I think , which speaks volumes for why this film must have an anti-hero as the main protagonist . I like how the film presents Dees , the backstories of those with stories to tell of past victims to him , the sleazy process of how he operates , and the way Dees falls to the one warning him to stay away . I loved the ending with how Dees , who basks in exploiting whatever works to bring him success , becomes the victim .

Christopher Lundgren ( the great Peter Cushing , my real reason for seeing this flick in the first place besides it's being an Amicus production ) among the group . He suspects a hairy Paul ( Tom Chadbon , an actor I really liked in this film ) to possibly be the werewolf , because of his nose-thumbing and witty insults towards the millionaire . Another possible suspect might be the nervy Jan ( a young Sir Michael Gambon ) . Both Jan and Paul try to leave the estate and fail miserably because Tom always has his eyes peeled for anyone suspicious . Tom even seems pretty suspicious of the sophisticated and terribly irritated Arthur Bennington ( the always terrific Charles Gray ) who finds the insinuations of his being a werewolf preposterous and insulting . Tom has cameras installed all throughout the woods and on the grounds ( along with a massive grid with sensors underground dictating if movement is occurring within the radius of the grounds ) with a security room featuring television monitors showing every last movement that occurs in and out of the mansion . His man of security , Pavel ( Anton Diffring ) thinks this whole werewolf business is rubbish . Despite all the equipment and ways of tracking the beast , Tom finds his quarry quite elusive and intimidating . The werewolf is smart , fast , and deadly . Tom fails many times in catching the werewolf as several characters , including the entire security room and Pavel , are destroyed by it . He must kill the beast before the three days of the Full Moon end . Neat little werewolf whodunit benefits from a fine professional cast . The werewolf is essentially a wolf covered in extra fur , so somehow director Paul Annett has the difficult task of making him believable scary . Annett , had to include a gimmicky " werewolf break " ( producer Max Rosenberg , who said he hated this flick , insisted that Annett include it to " save it " ) with William Castle-inspired 30 second clock so that we , the viewer , could decide who the werewolf was among the cast . I enjoyed the aspect where the prey outsmarts the smug hunter , who doesn't understand defeat .
436604	9938570	159693	7.0	Razor Blade Style	Lilith Silver ( Eileen Daly , fetching in the lurid , sexy role ) is so overcome with boredom she takes on the role of hit-woman-for-hire , labeled by the media and police as the " angel of death . " She murders certain chosen subjects who are part of an ancient secret sect known as The Lost People , or the Illuminati . . they wear a seven-pointed-star necklace and eyeball ring . Lilith is told that it is imperative to collect the eyeball rings from her victims as part of her finishing the kill by her source ( . . and lover ) , Platinum ( Kevin Howarth ) . The Illuminati's leader , Sethane Blake ( Christopher Adamson ) , is the one responsible for turning Lilith into a vampire centuries previous . The Illuminati are a powerful group with many of their members deeply en-routed in the fabric of London such as the government and police . Inspector Price ( Jonathan Coote ) , of the Scotland Yard , is part of the group but doesn't understand that his leader is indeed a vampire such as the one murdering those of the case he has been investigating . Price will take it upon himself to hunt down Lilith as a modern-day Van Helsing wannabee , but has no clue that those myths such as crosses and stakes have no effect on vampires whatsoever ( well , the stake can make you bleed , but isn't a major factor as in myth regarding it stabbing you in the heart with instantaneous death ) . What we do understand , through Lilith's narration is that decapitation and major blood-loss are what do the trick in killing their species . With the group hiring Lilith wanting their stash back because of her failure to retrieve the eyeball ring of a recent victim , Platinum's life will be in grave danger . Lilith cares for him and will risk her life in order to save his . It all leads to a confrontation between Lilith and Sethane as expected . Clad in tight leather with an ax to grind , Daly is quite easy to watch just by her sheer sex appeal alone . There's an overall Gothic tone , with lots of heavy breathing , hissing , and an abundance of theatricality . The film is a low-budget affair which took director Jake West 3 years to complete with the cinematography mostly shot on 16 mm film stock which actually gives it a grimy , grungy kind of appeal that works . West uses an assortment of framed shots assaulting the viewer with his camera calisthenics . The cast is lively , especially Adamson as the animated villain who loves to stretch out his dialogue with a sort-of hammy delivery and Coote as the rather uninformed , constantly-duped inspector make for an entertaining diversion from the usual vampire norm . Full of blood and feeding with Daly just relishing the role of vampire with the camera just embracing her figure and how it fits in the suit she wears on duty . Very British with an amusing ending .
436507	9938570	88000	8.0	Revenge of the Nerds	Watching NERDS again just proved that despite it's lovingly exploitive attitude , the jokes ( albeit perhaps dated after 20 years ) reflecting the on-going nerd culture as computers were becoming the key for the success of very intelligent people who dress and act a bit different are what make it so appealing . I think it's a time-capsule teen comedy when the formula worked and well . The film is based in stereotyping , but that is another one of it's appealing traits . It's easy for us who never really felt we belonged in the popular set to side with the victimized nerds for they represent the lonely-hearts who bask in the giant hurdled insult . The film , despite hurling those insults , engagingly loves these nerds and I think that's another key to the film's success . We can understand that without the wonderful performances from the cast portraying the nerds that this film just couldn't fly . The film is also so immersed in 80's pop culture that it is an amusing memory to dredge back up . The film shows the jocks as cretins pretty much abusive in every way . They step over the nerds because they deem themselves superior because of what they have externally than internally . We can see that they have to depend on what they have on the outside ( brawn and good-looks ) because the nerds completely overwhelm them on the inside . Carradine as Louis and Edwards as Gilbert are definitely the spark plug for the film and are so wonderful and likable , the material looks better . Then you have the gross-out jokes that worked well for Belushi in " Animal House " in this film represented by Curtis Armstrong's Booger who burps loudest and picks his nose the deepest . And , he can hurl one mean hilarious insult . His quips are the most funniest . Then you have Timothy Busfield as the elder Poindexter who seems to be the most clumsiest nerd of the bunch who sure has a hard time with the robotic maid . You have Larry Scott as the homosexual Lamar where the humorous gay jokes fly . Ted McGinley is the prick leader of the Alpha Beta jocks and Donald Gibb is The Ogre ( who probably would be considered a nerd if he wasn't so massive ) . Then there's the oh-so yummy Betty Childs who is McGinley's girl but falls in love with Louis after she discovers how good nerds actually are at sex . There's this non-PC attitude that reigns supreme as full frontal nudity is in heavy doses and many of the jokes would indeed be considered offensive . But , it comes down to seeing the nerds out-shine and out-last those jocks that leaves us particularly satisfied .
435964	9938570	70423	8.0	The Freakmaker	A university professor by day , mad scientist by night , Dr . Nolter ( Donald Pleasence exuding a quiet mania , portraying his character as someone completely convinced that his work is for the betterment of mankind despite how diabolical his methods are ) , respected by his peers , creates hybrid plant-humans in a goal to form a new evolution of mankind , using his own students brought to him by a carnival owner , Lynch ( Tom Baker , under effective hideous facial make-up ) plagued with the glandular Elephant Man disease . Lynch believes reluctantly that Nolter will cure him of his problem , for which he continues delivering specimens , but as friends of bio-chemistry wunderkind Brian Redford ( Brad Harris ) and Hedi ( Julie Ege ) come up missing , it's only a matter of time before the professor's ghoulish experiments and Lynch's kidnapping will be discovered . Lynch has another problem of his own making . . he treats his carnival employees ( . . freaks , to the " normal " audience who cheer , sneer & fear them during shows ) cruelly , displaying an ugliness just as much inside as outside . Lynch's crew have tolerated his insults and nasty treatment for a long time , and this film shows how his behavior towards them will result in a violent revolt echoing Tod Browning's masterpiece " Freaks . " And , as typical of " mad scientist " movies , the creation will get revenge on it's creator . . Nolter creates a plant-man who ingests humans for consumption from a belligerent student of his who always replied in classes against his theories . Macabre premise delivers some shocking moments including Nolter's creations and how one of them eats a street bum . Nolter's fate is especially grotesque . Baker is far removed from his charismatic , charming Doctor Who in portraying quite a tormented monster of a man who will do anything to remove the diseased face that keeps him removed from the society he yearns for . I found the seedy elements startling . . such as Lynch's finding a prostitute willing to yield to his desires for a certain fee , the numerous displays of female nudity , and how female specimens have their clothes removed while unconscious on Nolter's laboratory slab before being experimented on . But , despite all the rather unpleasant mutations we are witnesses to , the opening of the plant cycle , set to rather unnerving music , actually was as effective ( . . if not more ) to me than what comes after . And , director Cardiff has a lengthly showcase for the " freaks " of the carnival , with the viewer as " grossed out " or transfixed by each representative allowed to display their abnormality , as the audience in attendance . The script can be quite literate , whose " science-speak " might bore many viewers . If you're wondering whether or not Pleasence is hammy , he's indeed quite low-key , playing the doctor with a calm confidence .
436003	9938570	78087	8.0	The Scarecrow reviews " Piranha "	I want anyone reading this to know that my review is full of spoilers for to explain my opinions on why Dante's film so good depends on many plot points being exploited to make my point . One of the most important aspects of the film that I feel made Dante's film better than many of the horror pictures that would splatter on screens in the 80's , 90's , & even today is his depiction of the characters in the film . Unlike many horror films where the characters are so one sided ( most of the time simply unlikable ) where we just don't really care if they live or die thanks to the writers and direction , it's quite clear that Dante does . The children at the camp and their female counselors who are attacked are not bad people . One camp counselor who perishes is a good , warm hearted person who doesn't deserve to die . That specific scene is built unrelentingly by Dante . Throughout the film , Dante builds in our eyes the fact that piranha fish a heading to munch on unsuspected people who venture into waters they have no right believing are dangerous . That tension that Dante builds works because we know that if no one warns them in time , people will die quite horribly . I can only speak with the heart of a parent when I say that the moment the piranha fish begin to attack the children my heart beat 90 miles an hour . The film had been up to that point one of those very funny spoofs which uses clever humorous wit within it's shots at government's hidden secrets at developing war weaponry ( in this case piranha to " poison " the waters of Vietnam , but the project was halted when the conflict was deemed over ) that could have an aftereffect on Americans . But , once sweet innocent children ( just simply having water competitions ) are beginning to be attacked , the film carries a much more serious tone . The build up to a feeding is hauntingly done with a few actually paying the price for what their government ( who was suppose to protect not destroy ) did to them . But , things are even more grim when tourists are viciously attacked during a water festival . We see an explosion of horror as innocents out in the water are being torn to shreds . Body parts are shown throughout and much blood . The fun from the opening turns grisly as we see what can happen when a government goes to far , and in their ineptitude don't finish a clean-up job eradicating something they created in a lab . But , in returning to my position above , Dante's treatment of his characters is essential , I believe , to how I was impacted . Dante cloaks his female camp counselors with sweet music . We hear them talk and see how good they are to the children . They aren't like the sex-crazed counselors you might see in other films . Their language isn't obscene . They never gesture that dislike their jobs or those kids they are assigned to . When we see one of them trying to escape into a raft during the attack on the children , there was a realization that this woman was in trouble of dying . We see her helplessly try to grab hold to her friend's hand , but the vicious attack from those monsters in the water just won't release her . In a moment that just won't leave me , Dante shows the piranha carry her into the darkened emptiness of the water and she's lost to us all . It's a scene that devastates me because she's not a stupid ingrate that we often see in horror films , but a very likable human being who is taken away to be slaughtered . The final closing scene shows the aftermath of many dead because the man in charge of the festival wouldn't heed the warning of a woman who knew that the piranha were heading their way . The film shows that in not at least taking a warning seriously could lead to such horror . Dante won't let the viewer off the hook . He lets us see the piranha swimming in a pack heading for people who do not know what is coming . Dante could let our heroes get to the children in time and the tourists in time , but many will meet their doom . Dante delivers on the gore . He achieves both levels . The impact of the building up of the attack and subsequent violence that will certainly occur . We see heads eating , legs bitten off , blood soaking with shards of meat in the water , and the aftermath . In the final scene , the festival owner ( as the camp head looks over the sheeted body of a child he'd been warned to protect ahead of time ) looks over the sheet-covered bodies of victims , those who simply came to the beach to swim and have a good time . Sure , perhaps our heroes were able ( ? ) to poison the piranha with waste , but the aftermath is what leaves the viewer knowing that it is little too late to save those who weren't warned that it was quite possible that they could've been attacked . Yet , even then Dante gives them reason . They hear a call ( both the head of the camp and the festival head ) from a person that tells them deadly piranha fish are heading their direction . It would perhaps elicit laughter ( or disbelief ) from you to , wouldn't it ? You see Dante and writer John Sayles cover all bases . The film , I feel , is really good because it builds up and then delivers .
436104	9938570	43778	8.0	The Man from Planet X	A dying planet , turning to ice , is coming towards Earth at a steady pace ( thanks to " scientific degravitation " which was used to deviate the alien planet from it's natural orbit ) and Professor Elliot ( Raymond Bond ) informs a reporter pal , John Lawrence ( Robert Clarke ) of it's existence . Setting his lab in an old castle on a Scottish fishing village , Burry ( . . this location is where the alien planet will come to the closest ) , Elliot's daughter Enid ( Margaret Field ) and John discover as they are walking the moors a " magnetically powered range finder " ( . . used to determine the composition of the Earth's atmosphere ) whose metal is quite a find for science . Then that very night , after taking John to a little inn , Enid's car blows a tire . . . walking the moors she discovers a flashing light which soon unveils an alien space vessel , a one-bodied vehicle ( . . carrying the appearance of a silver ball with a cone-shaped top ) carrying a large-headed alien with an elongated face . Running for home , she informs her father and his associate , a rejected scientist recently released from prison , Dr . Mears ( character actor William Schallert ) of what she found . The professor , at first , has a hard time swallowing her outrageous story until finding the space vessel himself . A ray from the vessel beams upon the professor's eyes rendering him an object of servitude which would point out an ability this alien has at commanding humans to do it's bidding , forced against their will . But , at first , the alien seems to desire communication , particularly when the professor saves it from dying after a malfunction on it's suit ( . . and not being able to reach it's own " oxygen " gage which feeds it the air it breathes ) . But , Dr . Mears has plans to use the alien to benefit his diabolical schemes at global power , and shutting a good deal of his air supply while the others are away ( . . as a means to control the alien ) angers the creature who gets away , capturing Enid and subsequently kidnapping citizens of Burry by using it's powerful ray to submit their will . Using the controlled humans at his disposal the alien is setting up a wireless directional beam to his approaching planet who plan to launch an invasion . With Professor Elliot , daughter Enid , and Mears all under the alien's command , John will seek aid from Tommy ( Roy Engel ) , the village constable whose also worried about his citizens , those being captured and the terrified families . Calling in Scotland Yard detectives , using a long-shot form of communication , they will have to move quickly before the planet gets to Earth by Midnight or else the people of Earth face grave danger . Edgar G Ulmer uses everything at his disposal to make this modest little sci-fi chiller . Sets , models , matte paintings , a grotesque alien mask for the creature in a full bodied suit , a unique little alien ship , effective fog machines which give the moors a creepiness and atmosphere , and Ulmer , of course , brings his noirish background in photographing the film rather beautifully ( . . the way Ulmer shadows his characters and how he photographs them at night ) . If you are gonna make a low budget sci-fi effort , then Ulmer , a true artist , is the director to call on . But , the film is intelligent enough with characters who seem reasonably realistic . The alien threat / mystery ( . . what are the alien's initial motivations before and after Mears makes a decision to threaten it's life ? ) and approaching planet which possibly threatens the atmospheric nature of the Earth if it gets too close , truly gives the film a leg to stand on and the B-movie cast ( . . what you might find in a 40's Universal horror flick ) are top-notch . The film doesn't overstay it's welcome and thanks to Ulmer , the budget he saddled with doesn't distract because he's able to create through the use of his skills a real plausible world for which the story takes place . This is a sleeper worth checking out if you are into these sci-fi " potential alien threat " creature feature flicks . I respect Ulmer more for being able to succeed while being so financially strapped .
436765	9938570	126004	8.0	The Iron Rose	A young couple meet at a wedding party and decide to try a date . It starts out as frolicking on the grounds of an old train station as flirting commences . They decide to have a small picnic inside a cemetery and are so drawn to each other sexually , that the couple will seek out a warm spot to make love . . that being an underground crypt ( . . yes , certainly a bit morbid , but just wait until the next place they find for a make-out session ) . As night is upon them , the path leading to the opening gate seems lost in the dark , and our couple can not seem to find an escape route . Their relationship begins to unravel before it has a chance to grow . The young woman , in the opening of the film , found a peculiar iron rose in the ocean of a beach . This rose she feels will guide her to a place of love and happiness . The young female lead of this picture , the longer she remains in the cemetery , grows more and more mad as her newly required male lover becomes a victim of her lunacy . Through poetic rhyme , we get a glimpse into her shattering psyche and her male counterpart will become swallowed whole by it . . his fate is determined when she holds this idea that the outside world is dead and the only true life is within the grave with those who have long since died . Yep , she's bonkers . A love affair between the young female and the cemetery blossoms as we watch her orchestrate balletic movement throughout the grounds , embracing death now fully conceived as the only true way towards happiness . Now , I do realize a film such as this will certainly frustrate many , but I found it stunning . While the plot is simple , I felt Rollin's goal was to embrace the macabre atmosphere of the cemetery in every way possible . To be honest , I can't think of a better location to set a horror film than in a graveyard with those ancient tombstones , dying railings , rusty gates that screech and moan , & deteriorating crucifixes lining the grounds as masses of shrubbery and night invade and engulf . Rollin's camera lovingly captures the female actress in shots around angel statues that have seen better days , holding skulls , gently caressing her iron rose , and dancing in a state of bliss throughout the cemetery . . even when she's lost to insanity , her beauty glistens . Some haunting dream-like shots of the cemetery as dawn begins to appear , the ocean with the naked female lead and her rose , etc . The most morbid and wild scene in the film , I believe , is the one where the couple make out in a burial pit of scattered skulls and bones , the male lead fell into while trying , in a state of panic , to find his way out . Rollin introduces the creepy make-out session with a counterclockwise camera spin pointedly at a dazed male lead trying to gather his wits as the female lead looks down at him . She dives in , they clutch each other , and begin to embrace as skulls and bones move about behind them . . it's really a scene that goes beyond the realm of normal behavior . Various interlopers walking the grounds during the daytime ( each a little wink from Rollin such as the sad clown dragging his flowers toward the grave of a loved one or a familiar vampire barely glimpsed entering a crypt ) add some bonus oddness to this Gothic extravaganza . Either you love it or hate it . . I doubt there'll be much middle ground .
436827	9938570	283693	8.0	Zero Woman : Red Handcuffs	After she kills an American diplomat known for leaving dead women after rounds of sadistic sex , undercover cop Zero ( Miki Sugimoto ) is thrown in the pen to rot ( . . she is attacked by female prisoners during the credits ! ) . When a public political figure's daughter is raped and kidnapped by a group of hoods , Zero is offered a chance to redeem herself . . by infiltrating their gang , assassinating them , and retrieving the girl . It will not be easy considering their leader was just recently released from prison and is clearly unstable . . his face often twists into a homicidal rage when completely provoked . We witness just how uncontrollable his mania can be when a young member of his gang attempts to help their prisoner escape , bashing a bottle over the kid's head as blood squirts from the wounds . Zero is able to earn the gang leader's trust by helping him escape the clutches of cops who had him surrounded , getting access into the brotherhood , but suffers through a series of sexual attacks and physical abuse , while holding an amazing resolve , focused on the task at hand . Meanwhile , Zero's boss , President Nagumo's man in charge , follows the leads she provides , accompanied by a host of cops who plan to do what's necessary to quiet any type of possible scandal . If the idea that a scandal might come out , Nagumo will order the unthinkable to help his political career remain untainted . Zero may very will have to not only contend with the unhinged group of thugs , but those who hired her just so that a politician can keep his life free of scandal . One thing's for certain , director Yukio Koda knows how to deliver brisk action set-pieces featuring startling amounts of bloody violence . There's a definite amount of unpleasant sexual abuse towards female victims thanks in part to the nasty gang who often attack on a whim . . in fact , they only discover that they have raped and kidnapped the daughter of a major political giant only after consulting their " sis " , Sesum ( Yôko Mihara ) who provides them with a place to stay ( . . she's also one of the prisoners who attacks Zero in the opening ) . We see how unpredictable they can be when they besiege a group of school girls studying for a Shakespearian play , raping and abusing them in a very hostile manner , even setting the house on fire with them tied up and unable to escape . Miki Sugimoto is a rock of strength , an ice-queen avenger who is able to withstand quite a bit of punishment because of her profound devotion to fulfilling her duty as required . She's also stunningly beautiful and carries a confident , cool disposition which defines many heroine undercover assassins in Japanese action crime thrillers . The use of the red handcuffs is preposterous . . Zero is able to throw the cuffs locking whatever body part she so wishes as if a magician with an unprecedented marksman's skill . Lots of thick textured blood pours from bullet riddled wounds during shootouts and the hand cuffs even stab a throat causing gushing red . A pretty cringe-worthy torture scene also occurs as we witness techniques used to coerce information from one amongst the group ( . . using a blow torch , vice-grip , and water hose ) . This is over all far less disturbing than it could've been because of how director Koda lenses the attacks , cleverly showing less than appears yet still stirring up a reaction from the viewer . Such as the rapes , you witness the clothes ripped away , but Koda is able to keep actual penetration away from the screen , yet you still feel the intensity and terror felt by the victims and the despicable thrill captured on the faces of the tormentors . Shooting in some incredibly difficult angles , Koda also impresses with his impeccable camera-work . Despite familiar trappings we are accustomed to ( . . undercover operation to get a victim out of the hands of criminals using a cop with unorthodox methods ) , Koda films it all with style and skill .
435993	9938570	483607	8.0	Doomsday	The Reaper virus devastated a portion of Scotland with England building a steel , reinforced barrier splitting apart Great Britain . With signs of the Reaper virus reawakening in London , and the photographic evidence of those who have survived on the opposite side , quarantined away from " civilization " , the British government ( . . or what's left of it ) desires for a commando unit , led by someone of great skill and leadership ( . . able enough to pull off such a difficult , seemingly impossible feat ) , to find the cure which has allowed those uninfected to survive where the Reaper virus had ran rampant . Selected to lead the team is one-eyed Major Eden Sinclair ( Rhona Mitra ) , a skilled marksman with no fear , always calculating her next move , with an ability to handle chaos when others might falter . She is seen at the opening as the little girl whose eye was shot by a soldier with a hair trigger and is sent away by her mother on board a helicopter to safety as the madness of frightened citizens seeking refuge from being quarantined are all around her . Eden wears a high-tech eye which works as a video recording device and camera . She also has a watch which feeds her information from the eye . The soldiers under her wear the typically black hi-tech gear and carry the elaborate rifles able to blast the enemy with range and precision . They enter the quarantined Scotland inside armored tank-vehicles with security cameras and weaponry equipped to handle an army of marauders and savages as the case will soon become . They encounter a society of leather-clad , immoral cannibalistic , barbaric punks with mohawks , facial make-up , and piercings , a direct representation of a world gone terribly wrong it seems . They seem to have a singular mission , to harm and destroy , and those who decide to infiltrate " their city " are slaughtered . Eden and her commandos ( . . or those left after the savages pick them apart ) are to find a Doctor Marcus Kane ( Malcolm McDowell , whose chilling narration opens the film , informing the viewers of the horrifying future as it unfolded before the true plot forges ahead ) who was working on a cure before murder and mayhem arises having him flee with men elsewhere . Kane's son , Sol ( Craig Conway , letting it hall hang out ) , is the psychotic leader of his fanatical army , actually holding his decent and scared sister , Cally ( MyAnna Buring ) prisoner , planning much worse for Eden . Cally knows where Kane is and will lead Eden to his location . What lies in wait for Eden is a now diabolically mad Kane , who has built a new life for himself and those who followed him out of Sol's city , living within the confines of a medieval castle fortress , adopting a new type of civilization away from the past , isolated from the memories of yore , building an empire which threatens anyone from the other side . Obviously director Neil Marshall was inspired by his beloved influences , creating a wonderfully wicked hodgepodge of Escape from New York , The Road Warrior and 28 Days Later . . This will be considered a travesty by some , ripping off films from the past , but I saw it differently , working more as a homage , gloriously embedding the viewer into a harsh climate of violence and despair , a grim post-apocalyptic nightmare where all hope seems lost and only the mad or infinitely corrupt survive . Eden is a symbol of strength , fortitude , smarts , and cool . . a charismatic and formidable opponent towards those who wish nothing but hostility and death towards those they consider responsible for the pitiful conditions brought on by circumstances out of control . Those abandoned and left for dead cry out by inflicting misery on outsiders who pose a threat to their way of life and purpose . Featuring a Reaper virus quite similar to the one released by the monkey in 28 Days Later . . Eden is a female equivalent of Snake Plisskin , even missing an eye and wearing a patch ( . . and has a locater device which is smashed to pieces not longer after entering the quarantined zone ) And Sol's punks are very reminiscent to the violent freaks and weirdos from The Road Warrior . There's something quite surreal about seeing an action heroine facing off with a vicious punk one moment , and a massive soldier in gladiatorial combat within a suit of armour , not long after . One moment freaks on motorcycles and a graffiti-covered beat-up bus ( hearkening back to Hill's The Warriors ) are after Eden , the next Kane's men on horseback with a suit of armour , swords in hand , with archers equipped with a bow and arrows . Then the masterfully designed chase on the open roads as Sol's gang ( . . in modified vehicles featuring their deranged style ) are after Eden and company ( . . driving a Bentley they found in an abandoned warehouse ) featuring bristling scenes where crashes are imminent , across a gorgeous picturesque countryside with winding roads . Bashed in heads , a bunny rabbit blown to bits by an automatic machine gun , a victim cooked over an open fire as Sol's people celebrate a cannibalistic feast , imaginative beheadings galore . . lots of ultra-violence in store for those who crave such things . Marshall adopts modern techniques which might repel many . . quick cuts and breathlessly paced camera work are featured during the action sequences whether it be hand-to-hand combat or cars crashing into each other . Solid cast featuring Bob Hoskins as Eden's guiding influence Bill Nelson bringing his usual commanding presence to the film in an almost thankless role , Alexander Siddig as the Prime Minister , a rather spineless leader for a nation who has been abandoned by the other parts of the world , and David O'Hara as Canaris , the cold-blooded lieutenant who truly calls the shots , using his boss as a tool , just waiting to take his place . Great role for Mitra who conveys confidence and quiet swagger , also having the precise look needed to fulfill the role demanded of her . The Reaper virus is a nasty plague where humans ' faces are bombarded with hideous sores and cause the hemorrhaging of blood .
436816	9938570	89470	8.0	The Scarecrow reviews " The Legend of Billie Jean "	Many might use labels describing this movie as " hokey " or " preposterous " or " manipulative " , but one thing I believe is achieved in this little cult fave is Helen Slater's terrific performance as the female heroine who gets her revenge against scumbag Pyatt ( Richard Bradford ) . It's interesting that this film works off a basic premise about a young woman who will have to take it to the road in order to get $608 for her brother's ( Christian Slater in his first film , and he really shows promise at such an early age ) motor scooter being damaged by Pyatt's son Hubie ( Barry Tubb ) . The film makes Pyatt completely evil and greedy milking Billie Jean's " Joan of Arc " image for all it's worth . He's a sign of corrupt greed , pure and simple and seems , in this film , to merely be a vile scum-of-the-earth with no soul . Helen Slater , on the other hand , brings effortless grace , strength , dignity , sexiness , and charisma to her role as Billie Jean . You can see why this movie has a little following because Billie Jean is a representation of poor , but rather happy neighborhoods while Pyatt , and especially Hubie , represent the very smell of greenbacks . What is damaging , I believe , is that there is hardly any room for a grey area in this film . Billie Jean is good . Pyatt is evil . Peter Coyote , a very fine and sadly underrated actor , brings a level-headedness and understanding to his role as a cop trying to stop the madness , but constantly dealing with Pyatt and his ideas of not paying the money that is rightfully owed to Billie Jean . The film works well as a road movie and the young cast is so good , we love watching them together on-screen . Yeardley Smith steals the film as Putter , whose foul mouth and overeating provide much humor . Putter is the type to just speak out loud what most might keep to themselves . Martha Gehman plays Ophelia , simple and honest driver of the car . She is pretty much the one Billie Jean can truly depend on when things tend to get chaotic . Then there Keith Gordon as the " hostage " who Billie Jean falls for . This is one of Gordon's finest hours ( along with some good work in " Christine " and rather ho-hum work in " Back to School " ) and it's quite a shame the film doesn't get recognized enough for others to see how good this young cast was in this movie . Dean Stockwell turns in a supporting role as Gordon's father . . their relationship is strained at best . I will admit that this particular scene where Billie Jean is called upon to " save " a little boy from his abusive father was rubbish , but it was a padding placed in the film showing that so many feel that this young woman is a symbol for troubled , wronged youth everywhere so perhaps it might not be hammered by critics too much . The film's ending as this statue erected by Pyatt with Billie Jean holding a gun in her hand as if she's a terrorist falls into the pit of flames that starts up accidentally when he trips over a burning candle could be considered a bit hokey as well . But , my solid rating is pretty much based on my love for Helen's phenomenal performance and the good young cast . The soundtrack really is quite good as well .
436012	9938570	113241	8.0	Habit	Sam ( Larry Fessenden , who also wrote , directed , & edited this feature ) is an alcoholic manager of a café , coming off a relationship that is lingering awkwardly , meets an alluring mysterious woman named Anna ( Meredith Snaider ) at a friend's Halloween party . They later meet for a series of passionate sexual encounters . . their first featuring an intense bite on Sam's lip by Anna . Soon Sam's friends begin to disappear one by one , while his physical condition begins to worsen . We see that Anna may just be a vampire when , during a sexual encounter in a hospital supply room she bites him lustfully on the arm . In another very quick moment which reveals even more about Anna is after Sam has spoken a dedication speech for his late father . . she has taken the face of Sam's past lover , Liza ( . . this is quick so you must notice it when it comes ; we can see that she has taken the identity of someone people at that function might've seen in Sam's life before ) . But , the most revealing aspect of Anna is how she hides her entire existence ( work , personal things , family ) only desiring to constantly have relations with Sam with most being of a sexual nature . But , even though Sam finds these certain developments out during time , including his worsening physical state , he does not seem to care as long as he can continue to have those moments with Anna . Horror fans might know Fessenden the most for his directorial effort , Wendigo , but I like this film even more . It has that " Martin " vibe ( the George Romero tale of a vampire ) with Fessenden using authentic NYC locations shooting and unfamiliars in the acting department . The cast is quite good for being unknown ( . . these are probably actors and friends he has worked with in the past ) , but the startling aspect of his story-telling to me is how graphic the sex is between Fessenden and Snaider . Snaider fulfills her role quite well providing a vamp who we might could understand why Sam wouldn't wish to relinquish his passion with her . The film's location work might remind many of indie directors like Ed Burns and Noah Baumbach who often like making films surrounding NYC and having " regular " looking people in them . But , I think this film is closer to Romero who likes using rather regular looking people who we don't see in films unlike those I named above . Much like " Martin " , this film feels like a documentary of a doomed loser who has finally found something exciting in his life , despite the consequences that might occur later . I wrote this bad review pretty much as a heads-up to horror fans who are looking for a different kind of vampire tale . " Habit " is quite a low-budget wonder where Fessenden provides us with realistic flats and the rather ordinary places that ordinary people might frequent in NYC .
436357	9938570	100581	8.0	The Sect	An evil , Devil-worshipping sect , led by their enigmatic leader Moebius Kelly ( Herbert Lom ) have dastardly plans for Mirian ( Kelly Curtis ) and it concerns unleashing evil on the world through a sordid type of birth . That's the best I can do to explain this baffling supernatural , surreal religious horror outing from director Michele Soavi whose camera is always moving , capturing the action of every scene . The way an unusual blue water flows in Miriam's house ' pipes or the POV of a rabbit as it moves throughout Miriam's abode . . Soavi's camera captures such action intensely . There are quite a few bizarre moments in this flick like Giovanni Lombardo Radice's stabbing of a woman , later having her heart found in his pocket in a subway as a looter tries to lift something from his coat leading to his suicide after police surround him after aborting the train . Or a bizarre sequence where Miriam's neck is picked at by a crane . Herbert Lom has the most interesting part as the sect's leader , who informs Miriam of why she was selected to carry out benevolent plans against the world and God . There's a hole in her house's basement with major significance to the plot as it works as a type of gateway . What occurs to Miriam's schoolteacher friend Kathryn ( Mariangela Giordano ) when her face is " attacked " by Moebius ' facial death shroud , and Frank ( Michel Adatte ) , Miriam's confident whose a doctor she depends on as her life is spiraling out of control , when he discovers what the sect is up to ( . . like Frank , we are an eyewitness to a very disturbing ceremony where a female victim's face is removed so that their leader can gain " new life " ) are also very strange occurrences within the film . Miriam soon finds herself on her own against the dangers of a sect wielding a power far greater than mankind has ever known . While , at first , I tried to make sense of it all , soon I just gave up and enjoyed Soavi's distinctive camera-work . . he really doesn't take an easy way out trying every type of visually innovative trick he can think of to make each scene memorable . And , there enough wildly imaginative ideas at work to keep one from getting bored . Very dreamlike , hypnotic score from Pino Donaggio seems to mesh well with Soavi's style and the film's strange subject matter .
436657	9938570	783238	8.0	The Dead Girl	Lives are examined revolving around a dead young woman's corpse laying in a deserted valley in California . The woman that finds her , Arden ( Toni Collette ) is awaken from the morose existence of taking care of her vile , viciously scathing , unappreciative mother ( Piper Laurie who lets loose that nasty streak she always explodes forth so well ) . Arden soon meets a grocery bagger , Rudy ( Giovaani Ribisi ) , a rough-looking fellow with an obsession for serial killer cases , who desires her and which might provide a way out of the life she's stuck in . Leah ( Rose Byrne , whose stunning beauty is so well displayed off such a saddened exterior ) is a young college student who checks corpses for shavings under the nails and such , burdened by the misery of a missing sister ( been missing for around fifteen years ) and the parents who hold onto hope every single day that she'll be found . Taking anti-depressants and sleeping the days away when not at school , Leah believes she has found her missing sister who carries a specific birthmark which her own had in between the fingers . She feels , despite the horrible way the dead girl died , this weight has been lifted from so many years of her mother's ( Mary Steenburgen , doing so much with such a limited role ) constant universe involving the search and find of her daughter . It leads Rudy to the embracing of life accepting an invitation by a classmate , Derek ( James Franco ) to his party and opening the doors to an intimate relationship . There's finally an opportunity here , after closure of finding her sister's body , for feeling other emotions other than despair and grief . But , this girl may not be who Leah was hoping her to be . . Probably the most disturbing vignette has a concerned frustrated wife , Ruth ( Mary Beth Hurt with the best role she has had in ages ) finding that her husband Carl ( Nick Searcy ) may just be the serial killer everyone is looking for when she discovers " trophies " in a dresser located in what was supposed to be an empty storage shed ( they work at a storage business ) . What will she do if her frightening intuitions are correct ? Go to the proper authorities or sit on her hands as he continues to go out for days at a time possibly plotting and committing ghoulish acts of murder towards innocent women . Melora ( Marcia Gay Harden ) has been looking for her runaway daughter for sometime now , but when she does find her it's not exactly the reunion she had hoped . Finding a file with her daughter's police report containing information regarding her whereabouts before the crimes that took her life , Melora discovers a friend / lover , Rosetta ( Kerry Washington , in a stunning performance ) who has seen the cruelties of life first-hand . Melora finds , through Rosetta things about her daughter's unfortunate tough road in LA and the granddaughter she never knew about . We also find out about what caused Melora's daughter to run away . . Finally , we relive the final moments of the dead girl's life , Krista ( Brittany Murphy exposing how gifted an actress she truly is with the right part ) who just wants to get to Norwalk , a location where her daughter lives before the child's birthday commences . First , she's betrayed by a client ( Josh Brolin , looking like a trucker with tattoos covering his arms and such ) who promises to take her after some , umm , compensation . Then she retaliates towards Rosetta's beating at the hands of her pimp by destroying his vehicle and attacking him . But , when a motorcycle she borrows quits on her road back , Krista will need a ride . The ride she receives is with Carl who promises to take her to Norwalk after a stop . . Jarring , powerfully acted drama , potently performed by a great cast who give their all to the characters displaying how cruel and gruelingly emotional life can be . It's incredibly down-beat and depressing , it'll make you want to put a gun in your mouth , but yet so full of truth in a non-pretentious way . There are decisions each make that will change lives forever . The one that shook me up the most was the one with Mary Beth Hurt who almost turns her husband in , but has a change of heart . . what she does with possible evidence is haunting . But , the entire film is gripping even when we know what happens to Krista .
435985	9938570	62185	8.0	Reflections in a Golden Eye	Major Weldon Penderton ( Marlon Brando ) is grappling with buried homosexuality that awakens lustfully when he becomes enamored with an enlisted soldier ( Robert Forster ) working as a stable-hand for his horses . Penderton is bottled in an unhappy marriage to Leonora ( Liz Taylor , great as always ) who can be loud and overbearing , not to mention grating . Leonora has been having a sexual affair with Lt . Col . Morris Langdon ( Brian Keith ) while they ride off on horseback . Morris is also in an unhappy marriage to deeply troubled , fragile Alison ( Julie Harris ) still having a hard time coming to terms with the death of her child shortly after birth . She passes her sad days with Anacleto ( Zorro David ) , her servant boy who certainly represents a joke to the Army men around the area for it's obvious he's homosexual ( he dances around a room to classical music and paints with watercolors ) , but incredibly devoted to Alison . Alison has known for some time that her husband is cheating , but it takes courage to finally threaten a divorce . Morris clearly loves her , but the passion in their marriage has been gone for some time and Leonora fills that void . Meanwhile , the stable-boy Private has become obsessed with Leonora every since seeing her naked body as he stared through the window outside . The Private is indeed a voyeur who seems fixated on the Penderton's home , and he takes chances of being caught as he sneaks into Leonora's room at night smelling her perfume , staring longingly at her , and going through her underclothes . But , through all of this film , it's Weldon himself who is busting at the seams , showing the imprisoned torture his silence regarding his sexuality causes . The film balances all this drama rather effectively in an absolutely fascinating stew that shows how relationships begin to crumble when everyone hides buried iniquities from each other . Each character longs for someone else , yet inside the prison of military pride and honor , every secret goes unheard despite what everyone truly feels . Death ( as rumored at the start of the film ) will certainly occur in an act of violence that seems to be one things to the outside world , but inside that person behind it knows exactly why those shots will be fired . The film , through all the circumstances and betrayals that occur , is certainly set-up for tragedy because no one can follow how they really feel repressing their passions in " quiet " which will only boil over eventually .
436464	9938570	870958	8.0	Bloody Reunion	This was one hell of a reunion ! What is supposed to be a celebration for a dying teacher turns out to be far more sinister , bloody , violent , and painful . A group of adults return to reunite with their school teacher and we discover that each member of her class have grown with boulder-sized chips on their shoulders , their lives deeply effected by her mistreatment of them . The teacher's husband hung himself after she gave birth to a male child with a hideously deformed face . Keeping him in her basement , several of the school kids ( . . appropriately those gathered at the reunion ) often mock him , while one younger boy is kind to him . . the film sets up that this particular child ( . . who was actually criticized by the teacher for talking to her son ! ) is perhaps the young adult who begins sadistically attacking the characters of the reunion , one by one , surprising them when they are preoccupied , finishing them off in the basement where the deformed kid was kept away from the outside world . The film shows the deteriorating mindset of those who have gathered with their teacher , their emotional outbursts , confronting her on how she has misshapen their lives for the worse . Shortly afterward , however , most of them meet a grisly fate . I will say that BLOODY REUNION isn't your typical slasher . . this is a film with something to say . It is chock full with anger , pint-up animosity , buried hostility that is surfacing ( . . and had built over the years ) , and the reunion provides an opportunity to aggressively seek answers for the torment that has lingered due to the improper upbringing by a teacher who was supposed to nurture her students , not belittle and criticize them . The film has a whopper of a twist which many might compare loosely to HIGH TENSION , but BLOODY REUNION does it in a very effective way that works rather well and isn't riddled with plot holes . Almost completely told from the point of view of Jung-won ( Seong-won Jang ) , sadly slumped over the bedside of her mentor , to a detective attempting to piece together the sequence of events that led to the slaughter , the school teacher's indictment is brought to light over the course of the film . It is far from a pretty picture . The teacher is made to look as if she held a disregard for the poor , often ridiculed those with weaknesses ( . . one's nonathletic ability , another's weight issues ) , and even possibly molested her attractive male student ( . . which has turned him into a pill-popping wreck ) . At a very sickly state where she's confined to a wheel chair and can not control her bowels , the teacher is at her most vulnerable and weakest . Her punishment , the bad karma which is returning the favor , should be enough , but these former students , fueled by years of self-loathing , social rejects with buried contempt for the very one they sought approval ( . . always wanting to please her ) , have a chance to unleash the vitriolic rage held inside for far too long . The violence can get pretty unsettling as one is a victim of a vicious razor blade attack ( . . after bound to a chair , he's fed broken razors and water to wash them down ! ) , one's eyelids are stapled , another is pummeled with a bat ( . . before the final crushing blows , we watch as ants enter his orifices and bleeding wounds . . yuck ! ) , with eyes gouged , and a neck stabbed , blood squirting from the hole . The teacher's life is threatened multiple times when students approach her with violent intent , but each time she is spared in the nick of time . The very fact that they have such hate for her and are dying so horribly is enough punishment . . because she realizes that she's the real mastermind behind everything . Now , I will not reveal the twist , but before the bellyachers lay claim that it makes the film a waste of time . . I beg to differ . The teacher is still responsible for those under her care , and their obligations to those under her is of great importance . The mentor and role model , the teacher can shape minds , and motivate her students to be the best they can be . It can work both ways , and even if what we witness may not totally be accurate , the same negative feelings still exist and the behavior of an adult towards a student she has distaste for can ultimately bring about such dire consequences . This is a slasher with a potent punch . Care given to the characters and the twist isn't something merely thrown in there to foil the viewer , but comes from a dark place . Slasher fans definitely should give this one a shot . . it's a winner .
436329	9938570	154683	8.0	Hell	Various characters descend into a type of Buddhist hell for their multitude of sins . Each individual is judged by the amount of sins they committed and punished accordingly . Film's main focus of tragedy is Shiro ( Shigeru Amachi ) , a student in love with a professor's daughter . His " friend " is Tamura ( Yoichi Numata ) who has an uncanny ability to pop up out of the blue . Tamura is the source of misery for Shiro and seems to be some sort of demonic guide in leading him into constant trouble such as driving over a gang member and a car crash which takes the life of Shiro's beloved Yukiko ( Utako Mitsuya ) . The film shows how Yukiko's death causes a domino effect of further tragedy with Tamura constantly around to smile winkingly as hidden sins come to the surface causing a giant death sequence resulting in a majority going to hell . The mother and sister of the slain gang member plot to kill Shiro and the mistreatment of the elderly at an old folks ' home ran by Shiro's father are main focal points within the plot's structure . But , the film's gimmicky draw is Nobuo Nakagawa's artistic vision of hell . We see Shiri running through the cycles of hell trying to find and save the son he never knew he had as the infant travels on a lotus leaf ! If I'm honest , I found this unintentionally hilarious at times , particularly the theatrics of hell . You just have to see the concoctions Nakagawa comes up with supplying surreal images of several characters suffering torments in hell . A vortex of suffering humans , feet sticking out of the ground like weeds , people imprisoned in head-locking devices , a man being severed in half , etc . It's really a tragicomedy . You can't help but giggle at some of the over-the-top performances in the film .
435713	9938570	77304	8.0	The Cat and the Canary	Divine little " killer - on - the - loose - inside - the - creepy - mansion " thriller as someone supposedly from an insane asylum will perhaps harm a group of cousins , hoping for an inheritance from dear Cyrus West ( Wilfrid Hyde-White , simply marvelous in his limited screen time ) , who stay the night in his eerie large residence , filled with secret passage-ways . Annabelle West ( Carol Lynley ) is the official heiress to the fortune and mansion because of her being the next in line by name . But , stipulations regarding her getting the money come with receiving the inheritance news . . if she is proved to be insane . . or murdered . . after that night , the next in line to the fortune will get it . When Cyrus ' lawyer , and preparer of the will , Allison Crosby ( Wendy Hiller ; simply wonderful when on screen ) is viciously killed , Annabelle is in fear for her life for anyone amongst them has reason for perhaps using blood shed if it means gaining a fortune . A great cast , macabre sense of humor , and stylish direction really works wonders off of your basic drawing-room , Agatha Christie mystery . The house is a delightfully ominous setting and such spirited , game performances really works wonders in the setting . Edward Fox has a great entrance , through a window no less , as a flamboyant " asylum doctor " who informs the cast of the escaped loony who has fashioned a likeness with a cat , creating claws and such to heighten the effect . Beatrix Lehmann also has a memorable role as the quiet and oddball Mrs . Pleasant , a maid for Cyrus West who often is seen sneaking around corners and entering situations after something important to the plot has taken place . Carol Lynley as the heiress is simply radiant and charming . . also having sparkling chemistry with American cousin , songwriter Paul ( Michael Callan ) who becomes the unlikely hero . Mustn't forget Honor Blackman as the scheming Susan , trying to push Annabelle over the edge while the simply beautiful Olivia Hussey ( it was quite hard for me not to drool she's so lovely ) is perhaps her lover ( it's hinted at mainly when they insist on sharing a room together in such a large place full of empty rooms ) Cicily Young who hopes to possibly inherit the money herself . Daniel Massey is Harry , a man who had gained quite a bit of wealth through corrupt business practices while Peter McEnery is the homosexual bit actor / double Charlie , who was quite " close " to Cyrus and favored by the old man . Some of the ugly stuff ( despicable slow death of Crosby by the killer ( s ) ; possible unsavory activities in one of Cyrus ' secret rooms no one accept a select few knew about ) is subtly hinted at in key moments of dialogue . A ton of fun , colorful , and at times quite spooky .
436206	9938570	83976	8.0	Funeral Home	Teenager Heather ( Lesleh Donaldson ) moves in with her devoutly religious grandmother Maude Chalmers ( Kay Hawtrey in a terrific performance ) who , along with her absent husband , once ran their place as a funeral home , now starting up a tourist bed'n'breakfast for visitors in town . Heather soon discovers her grandma chatting it up with someone in the cellar , or so she believes . Maude forbids her passionately to stay out of the cellar , and has it's door pad-locked . Heather begins dating a local , Rick ( Dean Garbett ) who informs her of sordid details regarding her grandfather which she initially rejects angrily , but , over time , begins to question her grandmother's story of what happened to him . Rick's brother , newly hired Deputy Joe ( Alf Humphreys ) has been investigating a rash of disappearances plaguing his small town , against his sheriff's ( Robert Warner ) wishes , and soon realizes that those missing connect to Maude's tourist locale . A customer of Maude's , Mr . Davis ( Barry Morse ) , is also pursuing the disappearance of his wife , who was rumored to be the lover of the missing Mr . Chalmers , as he often reports to Joe on any information which might become available . When a visiting salesman and his mistress , using Maude's place as a refuge for their affair , wind up dead thanks to a mysterious truck driver who pushes their car over a cliff surrounding a watering hole , and Davis , whose snooping leads to a difficult confrontation with Mrs . Chalmers , suffers himself a grim fate , it's only a matter of time before the secret of the cellar becomes known . Through the developing mystery of director William Fruet and writer Ida Nelson , the film gives us subtle hints over time as to who might be behind the murders / disappearances . Throughout , we get facts about the main character unseen , the missing husband , and bit by bit everything falls in place leading to quite a suspenseful conclusion as Heather and Rick find themselves in danger as the ax-wielding nutcase in the cellar rears his / her face for the first time . The ending might not be a major surprise to those familiar with Psycho as the twist is eerily similar in psychological content to Hitchcock's masterpiece . It's still a doozy and I wish I could define how neat it is regarding the performance of the cellar psychopath , but I wouldn't dare spoil how it unfolds . Kay Hawtry is the whole show and displays with her face and demeanor a wealth of various emotions , especially when anyone approaches the subject of her husband and the cellar . Besides the ending , her reaction to Morse's amateur sleuth is a definite highlight . Donaldson was a perfect protagonist , the teenager blossoming into a woman , displaying her as mature , conflicted ( . . because she loves her grandmother and worries about her , not at all responding well to the supposed gossip regarding her grandfather ) , and scared . Stephen E Miller is memorable as a lurking handyman peeping tom , rather dumb and creepy , often spying on people in the bushes around Mrs . Chalmers ' place , or popping up on Heather as she snoops around trying to uncover mysteries that are bothering her concerning a history uncertain to her . The house at night and where it's located ( . . in the boonies surrounded by rural wilderness with country roads leading to a minor little town with people who have known each other forever ) are used rather well . And , the black cat Heather is frightened of is of major importance to the plot . . it's a clever plot-device who sees a great deal and will lead others to the film's secret . Great scene where a body is discovered by a local girl swimming underwater in the watering hole nearby Mrs . Chalmer's place .
436799	9938570	40636	8.0	The Naked City	How stolen jewelry leads to murder of a blond model named Jean in The Big Apple . The film is an exciting step-by-step methodical police procedural with Det Lt . Dan Muldoon ( the simply wonderful Barry Fitzgerald ) and Det Jimmy Halloran ( Don Taylor ) on the case . They find this particular case , however , quite a pain as many leads go sour as they search for the truth regarding the unfortunate death of such a beautiful young woman . It all leads to Frank Niles ( Howard Duff ) , quite the hunky ladies ' man who has secrets that Muldoon and Halloran have to find out . While it does lay the melodrama a bit thick at times , with hammy narrative by the film's producer ( perhaps worked well at that time , but really annoyed me ) , the exciting cinematography of NYC , captures the immediacy of solving a case lead-to-lead . I loved the use of New York City in how director Dassin captures time and place with the flowing of public . It's fun seeing the detective work in such a vast steel jungle where there are plenty of places to hide . I love the way the film shows chases amongst crowds of people . Stunning to behold with solid pacing . One can't help but look at this as the perfect model for how cop movies and shows have worked for so long .
436341	9938570	99637	8.0	Nightmare Concert ( Cat in the Brain )	I couldn't help but relish the entire premise of CAT IN THE BRAIN because it dutifully explains a director's steadily going mad , seeing people murdered from past movies he has made . Even mundane activities such as cooking a meal in the microwave or running a faucet of water yield some horrific butchery from a film in the past . Director Fulci playing himself , is directing GHOSTS OF SODOM ( ? ) and can not seem to deprive his mental well being from constant murder . He seeks help from a psychiatrist who , instead , uses Fulci's work as a method to execute a series of innocent people , hypnotizing the director into thinking that perhaps he's responsible . This is obviously a film playfully poking fun at Fulci's image , while exploring the themes of how such a profession , which produces so much death and destruction , rarely untamed , could mold and shape a legacy . The film features pretty much a wrap-around story surrounding non-stop graphic violence with every possible way to kill a woman expressed in grisly detail . This has a shower murder Hitchcock never could direct , or probably want to . The film's savagery compliments the mental state of Fulci's Fulci ( . . I know ) during the running time . Reality and cinematic fiction have fused and Fulci can find no escape . The ending ( . . explaining the old cliché : " It's only a movie " ) couldn't work any better than it does here . Fulci's boat says Perversion ( . . excellent touch ) and he sails off . . I can only wish this was his final film because that's a perfect close if there ever was one . David L Thompson is the deranged psychiatrist planning to kill his adulterous wife . Jeoffrey Kennedy is a cop Fulci fears had a family murdered by the fiend . The ultra-violence in the film features plenty of unique ways to take a head off such as the door to a chest , a scythe , a chainsaw , and hatchet . The most brutal violence derives from nasty chainsaw activity as a dead body is hacked to pieces ( . . how a gardener's chainsaw work on a log fits beautifully in one nightmarish hallucination sequence ) . . the most shocking use of a chainsaw is when a little boy gets decapitated ! The opening scene with the puppet cat tearing away , feasting on Fulci's brain , is a howler . The scenes which are spliced within the film , featuring a horrified Fulci looking on , are obvious , but I couldn't help but enjoy this anyway .
436882	9938570	470132	9.0	Kibakichi : Don't Awake the Beast	For quite a while humans and the Yokai shape-shifting monsters were able to live in harmony . But , soon the racist humans wanted the Yokai out of the equation with war sending the monsters into exile . Master Onizo wishes for harmony to exist once again and has benefited from what he believed was a satisfying relationship with Yamayi-sama , a leader-on-the-rise for the humans hoping to win a place in the hierarchy of the Lord . To decidedly earn a high position , Yamayi-sama plans to wipe out the Yokai remaining alive under Onizo's clan , betraying his trust and ruining his vision of peace . Kikio , a human , is actually Onizo's woman and a picture of beauty who is spiritually driven often seen on her knees praying . Enter in the Yokai Samurai warrior Kibakichi ( Ryuuji Harada whose penetrating anguished eyes peer from a mass of hair ) who is a loner often living amongst the humans , who now hates them with a prolonging passion . He trusted them once , like Onizo does now , and paid the price for it costing the lives of an entire peaceful village of hidden Yokai who were wiped out by the blind-sided human attack . Kibakichi makes his way into the clan of Onizo , whose major interest to the outside world is his illegal gambling table . In an interesting note , various Yokai killers , often find their way into secret rooms by Onizo where they are killed by the monsters . Kibakichi tries desperately to warn Onizo and his men against trusting Yamayi-sama , but the unrelenting hope for peace against the endless violence is all the boss is consumed with . As one would expect , Yamayi-sama does plan to attack what he considers a thorn in his side and that would be Onizo's village using more modern weaponry brought in from England . . a massive rotating machine gun that will eliminate the more primitive foes who merely use swords . Dubbing it the end result a massacre , would be an understatement . But , when you unleash the beast within Kibakichi all the machine guns , men , and grenades may not stop him . A stunning film , featuring some amazing swordplay , beautiful photography and lighting ( I adore how Tomoo Haraguchi and cinematographer Shôji Ebara hit a patch of light on characters ' faces as they sit amongst darkened rooms and also shade their monsters only giving the viewer enough during a portion of the film to know that they are not human ) , and some gut-wrenching gore . Lots of decapitated heads and arms , blood that squirts in endless supplies as complete arms are sliced off . One sequence shows , in Kibakichi's opening battle , a sword sticking in the ground with a chopped off hand still clutching it ! Kibakichi is essentially a werewolf , but director Haraguchi waits to unveil that beast late in the major showdown when the humans try to hit him with everything they got . Nozomi Andô as Onizo's human love Kikyo is very beautiful underneath a quiet exterior . I watched the subtitled version , so I saw the best the film could offer me . I know it's received some criticism on here , but I had one hell of a good time with this flick . The monster battle at the end and the intense gunfire exploding all around Kibakichi in werewolf form as the city is destroyed around him are amazing action set-pieces . Highly recommended to those with fairly strong stomachs .
436803	9938570	212132	9.0	The Tracker	Three white hunters and an aboriginal tracker are combing Australia for another aboriginal accused of killing a white woman . Mostly on horseback , the nameless white hunters have their tracker walk on foot doing his work . The most aggressive white man is played by Gary Sweet . Sweet's authoritarian is a blinded racist who deems himself and his race superior to the aboriginals and unflinchingly shoots women and children without remorse . His methods infuriate the Tracker David Gulpilil and we can see that the aboriginal will eventually get payback when the time is right . Damon Gameau portrays the green , newly enlisted soldier a bit in over his head , but at least feels somewhat humane to the aboriginal race even stopping Sweet from continuing his slaughter of a family of women and children . Grant Page portrays an older gentleman none too pleased to having been volunteered for this mission of retrieving the supposed aboriginal killer . He clearly makes it known to Sweet how he disapproves of his situation . As they journey onward there will come a point of reckoning as The Tracker , who had been chained by Sweet and led around like a slave often tugging on him like a mutt , will quietly get his revenge . The Tracker is all smiles , but in moments when can see the wheels turning as he keeps the white men distanced from the quarry buying time for him . I felt this was more a meditation and indictment on racism toward the aboriginal people . Certinly through the artwork present throughout , and sad melody that accompanies the film , we get a feeling of what the harshness must've been like . The always reliable Gulpilil has the ability to prove that less is more through his subtle performance . The harsh environs of Austrailia again is put to good use .
436122	9938570	72196	9.0	Spasmo	Slippery giallo from Umberto Lenzi has young swinging bachelor Christian Bauman ( Robert Hoffman ) , a wealthy heir to his dead industrialist father's massive factory , abandons his painter girlfriend for the beautiful woman , Barbara ( Suzy Kendall ) , he meets under awkward circumstances lying face-down on the muddy sand of a beach , with the appearance of a corpse having washed ashore . Their strange introduction gets even weirder when , not having been in each other's company that long , prepare for a sexual encounter ( he even calls her his " sweet little whore " ! ) when Christian shoots a scary stranger with the mysterious man's own gun . Barbara , in the other room getting undressed , doesn't see what took place , but persists that Christian leave the body where it's at and prepare to hide it , not calling the police to implicate her or him . But , Barbara has a man in her life , Alex ( Mario Erpichini ) who doesn't like Christian's moving in on his catch . Meeting at Alex's yacht , Christian startlingly remembers leaving his necklace at the hotel he and Barbara planned to have sex in . The man he shot is missing with only spots of blood leaving any indication that any person was there . From this point on , Christian's life spirals out of control as Barbara takes the poor , confused soul to a luxurious villa overlooking the sea as a couple who rents the joint show up . . older gent , Malcolm ( Guido Alberti ) , and his much younger squeeze , Clorinda ( Monica Monet ) . Christian becomes quite bewildered because it seems he has met Clorinda somewhere before , meets a strange man ( with shades hiding his eyes ) who was spying on him and Barbara earlier , seeing him having a conversation with Malcolm into the night . Clorinda and Barbara both act oddly around Christian as if they know certain things , but keep this vital knowledge ( that might help him sort out his plight ) to themselves . Soon , the man he thought he murdered shows up at the villa , and Barbara just might prove not to be the woman he thought was the chosen love for his life . Giallo mainstay Ivan Rassimov has a small but crucial role as Christian's brother Fritz known for bailing his brother out of trouble , and the actual responsible one running the factory business . . yet , he plays a heavy part in the story revolving around Christian . The film also opens the idea that Christian is schizophrenic since his family is known to have that unfortunate mental illness , an example being his grandfather . The death of Christian's father also reveals a specific aspect regarding his deteriorating mental state . Everything that seems weird and odd , those pesky loose ends that seem unresolved as Christian's life gets spun around in circles regarding the killer he supposedly murdered , come together in an incredible montage of death scenes unleashing a killer and his victims . It takes the typical giallo framework and spins in on it's head . Is the protagonist , who we begin to gain sympathy towards since his life is becoming a roller-coaster ride of bizarre psychological trappings , really who we think he is ? And , his brother Fritz . . what's with this guy and his motives towards his brother regarding the unfolding of events to come to a head at the end of the film ? I have read comments from many who have problems with the film's structure and logical story-telling , but I think this creates a most unusual and unique experience compared to the other gialli which flooded the Italian marketplace . Umberto Lenzi's premise goes into all sorts of directions with the protagonist captured in a state of paranoia and confusion , not knowing who he can trust or if what he's experiencing is even real . Motives of characters are often unclear . The overplotted chaos Christian is swirling in , I felt , creates a schizophrenic experience for the viewer . . in a sense , we feel as baffled as Christian does . I like this myself . . a lot . The mannequins Lenzi layers the film ( Lenzi himself titles this idea . . " the doll motif " ) are obviously designed to catch the viewer off-guard and provide an even weirder experience coupled with the mystery unfolding before our eyes . I think this film is great fun , mainly because I like these psychological thrillers where nothing is what it seems and anyone is suspect . The climax which explains what Christian and Fritz are suffering with ( . . and finally stamping what the hell those mannequins are indeed about ) I think works tremendously .
436560	9938570	67713	9.0	Scars of Dracula	Paul ( Christopher Matthews ) , a consummate ladies ' man , has the misfortune of being caught with the burgomaster's daughter by the father himself . Trying to evade his guards , Paul winds up at Dracula's castle when he can not find shelter anywhere else when his horse carriage was driven way too far from his village . Simon ( Dennis Waterman ) , Paul's brother , and his gorgeous girlfriend Sarah ( Jenny Hanley ) , seek out of their village to try and find him not knowing what evil lied ahead . This is continuing right after " Taste the Blood of Dracula " and we watch as a bat swoops over the remaining ash of the Count releasing blood from it's mouth . That very blood will revive Dracula back to his former bodily state where he can again unleash terror on the countryside using servant Klove ( Patrick Troughton , " Dr Who " fans might remember him as the second Time Lord ) to bring him victims . A specific bat , the one that fed the ashes of Dracula blood , does much for the Count such as killing , spying , and sending messages to it's Master . Can Dracula's reign of terror be quenched ? Or , will he now have enough weapons to continue his blood-lust and evil ? By far , the most sadistic and violent of the Hammer vampire films to that point , this is by far Christopher Lee's best rendition of Dracula . He's able to really be vicious and nihilistic , almost like a released animal from it's cage at times . His eyes are blood red as he prepares to take a bite out of females who wander into his midst , and his bat tears into the faces of his enemies and foes . The ending is quite a hoot involving fire which starts from a bolt of lightning as Dracula squares off with Simon .
435764	9938570	67690	9.0	Daughters of Darkness	Euro-horror tale about what occurs when Countess Bathory and her " female companion " become " involved " with a troubled couple at a very elegant hotel . The husband is supposedly unkind towards his wife , who becomes seduced / bewitched by Bathory . I thought it was fantastic , but do believe many might be turned off by the rather icy presentation ( I wasn't ) . When anyone ever mentions EBath around me , from time to time , I will always think of Delphine Seyrig . She epitomizes theatricality in a good way . I love one scene , after the burial of a specific person , when the Countess opens her cape , as the camera pulls , back draping over her new acquisition . I think one can see the exact , pain-staking detail by the director and film-making collaborators to orchestratingly compose each and every scene . . I respect the approach given to the film and think their efforts work splendidly . I found each female lead exuding their own type of beauty . . and feel it's pretty difficult to take your eyes away from them . AS far as our male lead , I particularly found one scene fascinating as a layer is slightly unpeeled when he contacts " his mother " on the phone . One might just see why he's in such mental turmoil just from this slight gaze into his life before his courtship and marriage to Daniele Ouimet . I didn't think Ouimet needed to bring any acting into this film , I felt the director was using her beauty , hypnotic ( . . a term I throw around a bit too much , but that's the reaction I felt so I use it here ) as it was , to frame artistic shots within the frame with John Karlen . I also liked how the director won't reveal Countess as a vampire , per se , instead showing her blood drinking in one particular scene ( . . probably my favorite of the film , when Seyrig isn't given the camera to do her thing ) from afar . One thing that many might criticize ( . . that doesn't bother me ) is the deliberate slow pacing . This is an atypical horror film . . it's more stylized art film ( . . for instance , what the director does with a red scarf as it drapes over a colorful lamp with the room dimmed a specific hue ) where presentation from scene to scene is just as important as the characters , and what their goals are , within the scene . A user friend on the IMDb horror message board I felt was exactly right when he mentioned how Seyrig modeled her character after Dietrich . The way she moves her hands is exquisite , how she smoothly delivers her dialogue , how seductively she takes over the conversation and mood of each gathering , and the way she is dressed . She's an amazing sight , and I won't soon forget her " departure " from the film .
435943	9938570	58606	9.0	Spider Baby	Bizarre cannibal comedy regarding a family of mental savages under the " parental supervision " of Uncle Bruno , The Chauffeur ( played with heart and gusto by the great Lon Chaney , JR ) who just wants them to quit killing passersby . You have Virginia ( Jill Banner , who despite her insanity is oddly sexy ) who loves spiders so she often behaves like one and eats them ! You have poor Ralph ( Sid Haig , such an inspiring bit of casting ; steals the entire film ) whose condition has worsened to the point where he behaves like an animal . And , the quietly demented Elizabeth who seems all too innocent and peppy until we see the monster pop out of the closet . Bruno seems the sanest of the clan of oddball weirdos and promised his brother that he'd never let anyone take them away to be probed by the public at large . Yet , it was only a matter of time before their wealth would be exposed ( . . although , one wouldn't think they had any money at all considering the way their place of residence has become so ruined by uncare , decay , and time ) by other more normal family members ready to cash-in . Those " distant relatives " are the Howes , Emily and Peter ( Carol Ohmart & Quinn K Redeker , the cousin who tells us his story regarding the trip to meet this group of nuts ) who use an attorney , Schlocker ( Karl Schanzer , quiet a weaselly character who wreaks of pomposity and snobbery ) to inform the family that they stand to lose everything because of their unfortunate conditions due to family inbreeding which slowly turns functioning human beings into mental deficients . Ann ( Mary Mitchel ) is Peter's love-interest who becomes a target of the family when they deem her a threat at exposing their deep dark secrets from downstairs . The film has little sick jokes which come from the woodwork towards the end which gives this twisted little black comedy an air of unpredictability that is priceless . . in a sick way that is . Seeing Sid Haig mutting around like a dog is truly reason enough to see director Jack Hill's cult classic , but Jill Banner as the Spider Baby is truly hard to turn away from . She has a scene where she ties up Peter in her " spider web " with plans to kill him like a bug . Now in this scene she pulls up her dress to expose this pair of lovely legs , kissing Peter delicately on the cheek with her tongue ever so gliding on his face . . you forget for a moment that she's crazy and find yourself , like Peter was , in a state of lustful abandon . But , Chaney , Jr . has an endearing , beautifully realized scene where he dotes on the notion of his family being taken away from him ( . . and breaking the oath promised to his brother ) and you see these tears just well up . . it's actually rather touching . And , his singing the theme song is just terrific . If you are into strange cinema , SPIDER BABY is a must .
435830	9938570	100150	9.0	Miller's Crossing	Tom ( Gabriel Byrne ) is Leo's ( Albert Finney ) right hand man and intelligent voice of reason . Being the city's top gangster , Leo depends on Tom's advice . The pot is stirred when Leo's moll , Verna ( Marcia Gay Harden ) has a pesky brother Bernie ( John Turturro ) who is stealing from rival mob boss , Casper ( Jon Polito ) . Casper wants Bernie dead and will clear Tom's gambling debts with a local shyster Lazarre if he'll complete the task . Tom has another problem besides his debt and that is his sleeping around with Verna . Casper makes it known that he wants to be head honcho of the city and offers a partnership with Tom if he'll switch sides . Casper even tries , and fails , an attempt on Leo's life sending goons with tommy guns to kill him . Leo does lose his position , but won't go away . It appears that Tom has switched sides , but things are always uncertain in a Coen brothers film . The story unravels as circumstances surface such as Dane ( JE Freeman ) , Casper's heavy who doesn't trust Tom and follows him . You have Bernie who is indeed a thorn needing removal even towards Tom . But , one figures that the " cool-under-pressure " Tom has a scheme brewing that will benefit himself first . Leo seeks blood for the death of one of his men , tailing Verna . Also , a pal of Bernie's , Mink ( Steve Buscemi ) plays a special part in certain key moments in the way the plot carries out regarding both Tom and Verna's annoying , thieving brother . As in most film noir , the characters are all flawed , imperfect and corrupt . . there's no one who escapes unscathed without at least one skeleton poking it's head from the closet to wink . The protagonist , Tom , isn't exactly the kind of hero one roots for as he is , it seems , merely out for himself . But , the motivations of Tom and his manipulation , without the blood caking in the cracks of his hands , is the real reason to check out this nasty piece of work that represents the noir genre dutifully . The photography , and era detail are flawless . The complex story as it unwinds is a lot of fun . Twists abound and many characters will just about have Tom licked when it seems a guardian angel rescues him from underneath the tightening noose .
435965	9938570	71675	9.0	It's Alive !	A family is riddled with tragic repercussions when a baby is born a mutated monstrosity with an urge to rip the throats of victims after it escapes the hospital . Starting with the hospital staff in the delivery room , Frank and Lenore's ( John P Ryan & Sharon Farrell ) monster baby goes on a rampage , attacking citizens in Bevery Hills including a milk man . Frank and Lenore's names are released to the media as the parents with their life taking a turn for the worse . Not only do they have to deal with having such a monster baby , but knowing that it's killing folks in the Beverly Hills area and that people look at them strangely as if they were at fault somehow . There's a killer monster baby out there , somebody's got to take the blame so why not point the accusing finger at the parents , eh ? Frank loses his lucrative public relations job ( . . kind of a sense of irony here , considering Frank's life is a public relations nightmare ) and Lenore is slowly growing mad . As the police issue a man hunt , researching scientists wish to study the child , although the pharmaceutical company who created certain pills Lenore was taking during her pregnancy wish for it to be dead . . destroyed beyond recognition so that any kind of scientific study would not yield results damaging the precious reputation of the medication issued by any big name company . While their eleven year old son Chris ( Daniel Holzman ) remains with a friend , Charley ( William Wellman , Jr ) , the couple try to cope somehow with the various traumas put upon them . But , the baby wishes to find mommy and daddy . . You know it's been quite a while since I last saw this , but I never remembered Larry Cohen's pinnacle of monster / killer baby flicks ( . . honestly , when you hear the moniker , " killer baby flick " , what's the first movie that pops into your head ? ) being as depressing and thought-provoking as this viewing turned out to be . A nice little twist at the end pointing out that perhaps a plague was developing across the nation , and questioning whether or not certain medications or radioactive elements cause abnormalities and various deformities to born children , really give this flick a surprising sub-text not often associated with these type of films . The performances , from Ryan and Farrell as the tormented , agonizing parents who didn't ask for the problems forced on them , really won me over . There are scenes where Farrell as Lenore attempts to return to a sense of normalcy that her family's lives had , with those around her ( . . and us ) noticing that she's deteriorating emotionally and psychologically . . this burden of not being able to hold a child you carried in your womb for 9 months and the fact that everyone wishes to kill it certainly is displayed to the viewer through Farrell's crumbling demeanor and burdened face , attempting to smile with nothing but sadness behind it . There's one terrific scene for Ryan ( . . although , he has many when the film pointedly expresses his aching and thoughtless determination to kill the beast which has caused so much pain to his family ) where he . . in the sewers with the police searching for the baby . . is face to face with his monster child realizing , through tear-swelling eyes , that he can not kill what it essentially his son . I think that's another aspect that impressed me . . the idea that society looks at the deformed and ugly as inhuman only fit for death , while the parents see a child of theirs with a right to live regardless of how it was born . I felt Cohen did the right thing by hinting at the monster baby without elaborating in great detail what it looks like . Through visual tricks , Cohen keeps the baby from being completely visualized , escaping ( . . mostly ) giggles and chuckles from an audience . I do think , believe it or not , that the film holds it's own thanks in part to the serious tone and interesting subject matter , performed admirably with a straight-face . There's no doubt , though , that the film was made on a cheap budget , but I felt Cohen overcomes that thanks to the performances and script which I think work .
435890	9938570	109592	9.0	Dellamorte Dellamore	A caretaker for Buffalora cemetery has the difficult task , along with his mute subservient simple-minded assistant , to keep the dead ( . . who rise from their graves days after their demise ) from leaving their new homes , using specially marked bullets which split apart their skulls on impact . The job weighs on him as a lovely widow returns to the grave of her much older husband , turning his world upside down . . her otherworldly beauty shakes him out of the daily grind of blasting holes in the skulls of the undead . But , when she becomes a victim of an unfortunate error caused by his hand , our dark hero's " life " follows a downward spiral . What a film ! If the ending doesn't leave you breathless , Anna Falchi as the unattainable muse our hero Francesco Dellamorte ( . . played dead-pan by the handsome Rupert Everett ) covets deeply , with fate always snatching her from his grasp , will . I have to say that Falchi must be considered one of the most beautiful women to ever grace a horror film , in or out of clothes . I would even agree that sex in cemeteries isn't exactly the most erotic choice for a locale , but thanks to the attractive leads , these moments are actually highly charged . Visually , the film , scene to scene , offer one dazzling , brilliantly conceived set piece after another . Such as the ossuary with the walls of skulls , roots & skeletal bones as Dellamorte and Falchi's " She " kiss while their heads are covered by veils was just stunningly realized . Or , the amazing silhouetted kiss with the massive backdrop of an enlarged moon . The Grim Reaper , as he forms from the burning pages of phone books ( . . Dellamorte's favorite reading material ) , warning Dellamorte against " taking his job " . Dellamorte's shower interrupted by zombie cub scouts , and an enraged male nun ( ? ! ) , trying to receive help from his assistance Gnaghi ( François Hadji-Lazaro , nyah ! ) whose immersed in his television program . The mayor , always concerned with keeping his role in office , being attacked by his dead daughter's angry severed head when he wouldn't blessing in her marrying Gnaghi ! Zombie Claudio exploding from his grave on a motorcycle with mortal girlfriend allowing him to feast from her flesh , furious when Dellamorte wished to put an end to her undead beloved . It seems that the film leaves some cold because of the macabre comedy such as the killing spree that ignites supposedly by Dellamorte on live humans . But , I think , the film , through an enigmatic , existential script , shows the disturbing plight of a man burdened with a career that has denied him of a life that perhaps doesn't ( . . or never has ) exist . A theme that never dies is the denial of love for Dellamorte . He's teased by the idea of love when Falchi returns , in various forms as other characters , but is always left wanting . That ending which leaves the jaw-dropping , " what the . . " feeling I think is hinted at during Dellamorte's " chats " with Death . His final moment with the Grim Reaper , as Dellamorte decides to leave the only place he's truly ever called home , has Death asking him , " Where are you going if you don't understand the difference between life and me ? " Ahhh , such food for thought once you add that statement to a visual touch igniting that question , as Dellamorte and Gnaghi pursue what lies at the end of a tunnel . What " life " has this cemetery man ever known other than the job of sending the dead back where they belong , just yearning to return and ending up back in their graves ? Besides the more difficult material presented , zombie fans ought to get fulfilled by plenty of gory attacks such as the use of Dellamorte's pistol as it blasts through heads and the way a spate sticks into the skull . There's a very violent sequence where Dellamorte shoots hospital staff and a nun come to check on an old pal of his , comatose on the verge of death , which might leave a few people disturbed . . even though it seems played as tongue-in-cheek . And , even before this a massacre leaving several dead by Dellamorte's hand seemed like a dream , until the police detective came pounding at his door with the news ( " At time I get ahead of my work " ) . And , a gag the film plays with is the police detective who never suspects Dellamorte despite evidence of possible wrong-doing . There's also some very quotable dialogue , often thought-provoking and interesting . There's laughs aplenty through poor Gnaghi , with his ugly looks and rather untidy manner . . . he's such a lovable ( . . and devoted ) character , though . Some of the effects are flawed such as the little balls of flame where string can easily be seen , or some zombie heads which get destroyed . I guess this could be a bit heavy-handed and outrageous for some , but I found it Gothic bliss with non-stop visual imagery and an unpredictable nature I loved . It's quite wicked , though , and not for everyone . I think this will be Soavi's considered masterpiece like SUSPIRIA was for his teacher Dario Argento . The snow globe that closes the film adds the perfect touch of mystery that leaves you pondering on what you had just finished watching .
435718	9938570	74621	10.0	Healter Skelter	Stunning , matter-of-fact television film runs around three hours but holds it's grip the entire time . Steve Railsback is absolutely mesmerizing ( . . and terrifying ) as Charles Manson , the cult leader claiming to be Jesus Christ and commanding his followers ( four of them mainly ) to murder rich " pigs " in California . Most notable was pregnant actress Sharon Tate , famous director Roman Polanski's woman , along with others in the house that horrible night . Along with those were the La Biancas , also unfortunate chosen victims of the Manson followers . Along with Railsback chilling portrayal was Nancy Wolfe as Susan Atkins who will bring eerie goosebumps as she describes in luridly evil ( yet coldly and unapologetically ) detail how she murdered Sharon Tate as she begged for herself and the unborn baby she was carrying . Not to mention how she describes the " gurgling sound " that a victim makes choking in their own blood . We also hear about how a fork was used to carve " war " in Mr . La Bianca's torso . Another interesting ( . . and good ) casting choice is Marilyn Burns in the important role of Linda Kasabian . . the young follower who would be the ultimate voice that put away five cold blooded killers . George DiCenzo portrays DA Vincent Bugliosi , the man whose life would certainly be effected by the immense strain of putting together an extremely difficult case against Manson . . who was the lynch-pin in causing a rest in the fear so many were feeling . The film covers in pain-staking detail the events before , during , & after the case ( even the mass media aspects revolving around the case ) .
436254	9938570	220827	10.0	Sleepless	I feel " Sleepless " is a fine example of how to make a giallo and make it right . The red herrings , the reasons behind why and how the killer works , the violence which is jarring and graphic , the strength of having a legend , Max Von Sydow , as the central sleuth detecting , and the great finale which is actually quite satisfying . You'll have detractors saying that this has such familiarity to it , but I felt this is a completely original story in it's own merit while exhibiting the traits fans of this genre know and love . The film concerns killings from the past and how they connect with a fresh crop of new killings . It is said that a killer dwarf ( ! ) was behind the death of three women , one being the mother of Giacomo ( Stefano Dionisi ) . . viciously slain by a musical instrument . It is stated that Ulisse Moretti solved the case which ended when a dwarf named Fabritiis decided to commit suicide instead of tolerate the scorn of others lying guilt at his feet for the slayings . The fresh killings bring that case back to fruition and Moretti begins to suspect he was wrong in fingering the dwarf . It seems the killings are following a pattern from a nursery rhyme book with animals . After each female is killed , a cut-away picture of an animal is left by their body . Giacomo , who had left the area , returns at the invitation of an old school chum , Lorenzo ( Roberto Zibetti ) . With Moretti , Giacomo go on their own investigation and make some startling discoveries on the way . During the course of the film , Giacomo will also have a passionate affair with a talented harp player , Gloria ( Chiara Caselli ) . This film has some very nasty killings such as a poor woman who gets her face bashed up against a wall , a man who receives a gold pen inserted in his skull , not to mention some knife slayings for good measure . The train sequence in the opening ( . . not to mention what happens shortly afterward ) is very well done . There's an inspired sequence where a ballerina is beheaded during the intermission of a " Swan Lake " concert . I love how the film develops over time as we discover the connection between the animal rhyme book and the slayings , not to mention who the killer really is . Everything comes together in such a thrilling was . An essential giallo , and one of Argento's finest films .
436682	9938570	57603	10.0	The Three Faces of Fear	Trio of macabre terror tales from Italian Horror Master Mario Bava , with the great Boris Karloff opening and closing the anthology . This is a minor review for the newly restored Italian Language version , The Three Faces of Fear . In " The Telephone " , an evil voice across the phone terrorizes a beautiful young woman , Rosy ( Michèle Mercier ) threatening her life . Who is the voice across the phone ? Could it be Frank ( Milo Quesada ) , a man who has recently escaped prison , put there by Rosy ? Rosy is so terrified , she'll call a former lesbian lover , Mary ( Lidia Alfonsi ) to stand by her side . But , who exactly is that person with such supposed malicious intent across the phone ? This not one but two twists which are a doozy ! In " The Wurdalak " , Count Vladimire d'Urfe ( Mark Damon ) is passing through a specific area when he comes across the headless torso of a Turkish killer with a certain dagger stuck in it's back . That dagger belongs to the patriarch , Gorca ( Boris Karloff , quite sinister ) who may be a wurdalak , a bloodthirsty corpse who yearns for the blood of those he loves the most . d'Urfe soon meets Gorca's family and falls in love with the lovely Sdenka ( Susy Andersen ) who , along with her brothers , tries to warn the Count to leave the premises before Gorca returns . Gorca told his children upon leaving to find the Turk that if he didn't return in five days at the stroke of Midnight he would probably be a turned wurdalak . When Gorca returns , with a very creepy disposition , d'Urfe watches as he slowly turns the family into wurdalaks hoping to at least save Sdenka . But , Gorca will not rest on his laurels until his whole family joins his side . . In " The Drop of Water " , nurse Helen ( Jacqueline Pierreux ) steals a very valuable ring from the finger of a dead Countess who fooled around with the spirit world , holding séances every Friday night . The Countess ' maid ( Milly Monti ) tells Helen she just didn't die of a heart attack , but was frightened to death by the spirits . Helen , after returning to her apartment , is tormented by the spooky sounds of dripping water , creaking doors , and . . the demented stuck grin of the dead Countess coming towards her ! Each tale is filled to brim with style , color , eerie chills , and atmosphere . Seeing Karloff in great form as a vampire , through the artistic Gothic eye of Bava is thrilling . I think the final two are Gothic triumphs , while the first is a fine little unraveling thriller where those who wish to deceive another will fall on the sword . The third tells us that we should never steal from the dead . I felt the second tells us that family is important ( a little bit of black humor for you kind folks , forgive me . ) . Probably the best horror anthology ever made ( . . although , I'm sure fans of " Dead of Night " might think otherwise ) .
