436146	9938570	429573	1.0	An American Laugh or two	Really , really lousy ghost tale supposedly based on a true story about some kind of entity terrorizing John Bell ( Donald Sutherland ) and his daughter Betsy ( Rachel Hurd-Wood ) . They believe it to be Kathryn Batts ( Gaye Brown ) who threatens them with witchcraft . Sissy Spacek plays the worried mother , Lucy . James D'Arcy plays a concerned schoolteacher of Betsy's named Richard . The editing is crippling to this film as we experience a cavalcade of flashback sequences which really grate on the nerves not to mention uninspired , cheap special effects ( there's a sequence where Betsy's hair is being pulled and you can see the wire pulling it or the constant cheap effect where the bed covering either pulls from Betsy or is pulled back over her . . anyone can see the device underneath the covers winding the sheets and blanket ) . There's a Gothic look , but that can not save a cast who wishes they were somewhere else . How the talents of Sutherland and Spacek got swindled into this horrible movie is anyone's guess . But , it's who that is doing the ghostly tormenting that'll make you laugh your ass off . Terrible beyond words is that final twist . The film stays completely straight-faced and is hilarious to see unwind .
436475	9938570	427688	1.0	The Possessed	Cassidy ( Kacia Brady ) puts a gun in her mouth blowing the back of her head out on boyfriend Neal ( Jason Dibler ) . Cassidy was the lead singer of a " demons and death " rock band who couldn't shake the sad feelings of her boyfriend's neglect towards her ( you know , I can find other reasonable ways to solve this other than putting a bullet through your head ) . She returns , however , possessing the soul of Dora ( Jill Small ) her friend who is to replace her on vocals so that the group can finish the album halted by Cassidy's untimely death . But , Cassidy made a deal with the dark one and souls are to be collected . . she's consumed by this anger towards mainly Neal , but all the band members or anyone within the music studio get dead when they fall prey to whom they believe is a rather distraught Dora . . not Cassidy returning for payback . Lousy micro-budget horror flick looks cheap , has a cheap cast who should make plans in another line of work , and boasts cheap kill-scenes which aren't effective one bit .
436914	9938570	454082	1.0	Black X-mas	College girls are being slaughtered by a serial killer named Billy ( Robert Mann ) and his " sister " Agnes ( Dean Friss ) on Christmas Eve . We see flashbacks to when Billy was growing up using snippets of certain years at Christmas . We see his mistreatment from his mother who , along with her lover , kills Billy's father in the same method he adopts . . a black garbage bag as the suffocating weapon with some sort of sharp object to finish each victim off ( his father was killed by a hammer ) . Agnes was born through Billy and his mother . Billy , borrowing what he learned from step-dad and mother , kills his parents viciously ( . . as a result Billy winds up in an asylum . . after jabbing his " sister " in the eye , Agnes will be sent away , but vanishes ) . In the opening of present day Christmas time Clair ( Leela Savasta ) is murdered by someone who appears from under her bed via garbage bag and pen . Clair's sister Leigh ( Kristen Cloke ) is supposed to meet up with her and winds up at the sorority house wondering why the rendezvous never occurred . We see Billy escape the mental asylum / prison by fooling a numb skull guard eliminating him oh so easily ( one of many hilariously ill-fated antics by the screenplay writer and director Glen Morgan ) . Billy , as a sick joke tossed in , has a yellow pigmentation . The film is an endlessly mean-spirited gore-fest where each member of the sorority is destroyed in gruesome fashion . Like THE FOG remake , this film takes it upon itself to over-explain everything about Billy leaving absolutely no mystery which made Bob Clark's original so haunting and fascinating . Billy and Agnes is simply a joke leaving absolutely zero suspense . . just various bloodshed with sharp tools . Lots of blood spraying and the crackling of the killing tool as it penetrates the flesh with ferocity . The flick has a nasty , vile , mean-spirited attitude leaving little glimmer of hope regarding entertainment value . To be bluntly honest , this stinker is about as entertaining as the pulling of teeth from the roots . It's a moronic , by-the-numbers exercise which insults the original . The females that populate this flick all seem to follow the mold of Margot Kidder's chick in Clark's original . The problem with that is Kidder's novelty was that she was the only female of said film who spoke bluntly and rudely so it was funny . When you have an entire cast of these types , it gets annoying fast . And , the ending ( . . oh boy , that ending . . ugh ) takes the cake . Truly awful .
436774	9938570	382943	2.0	Return to Sleepaway Camp	Pointless , juvenile , absolutely worthless ( . . unless you just have an urge to see stars from the original returning to reprise their roles ) sequel to the original Sleepaway Camp ( . . the second and third films featuring Pamela Springsteen in the " prominant " role of Angela are completely disregarded , which is probably a good thing , I guess ) has a psycho-killer , in black hoody , targeting those who victimize and mistreat extremely repellent frog-devoted Allan ( Michael Gibney ) , always the center of negative attention in regards to practically everyone , in constant disagreements , arguments , and skirmishes with the teenagers / adults in camp . He's either starting trouble or the recipient of it , but Allan is certainly a lightning rod towards the inner-workings of the plot . . the film displays many embarrassing scenarios featuring the flabby whiner and people die because this . When the mean teenagers belittle and abuse him , Allan retreats into the woods to find refuge with his frogs . Allan has a crush on Karen ( Erin Broderick ) who assists her friends in playing a practical joke leaving him quite scorned resulting in quite the killing spree towards those who delighted in his misery . A penis is pulled from a counselor whose bound , by rope , to a tree . A female counselor gets her head and face twisted in barbwire while attempting to flee in a jeep . A black teen girl , often at heated odds with Allan , is squashed by a mattress of nails . The head counselor over the Camp has his head caught in a cage after awakening from a hammer blow to the head , tied , with rats to feed through his face , shown gnawing within his torso . One pot-smoking slacker is burned alive after being force-fed gasoline , with his stomach exploding . A real practical joker who often bullied Allan gets a wooden spike stabbed through his eye . And , a vulgar cook who ridiculed Allan endlessly , gets his face shoved into cooking grease . Lots of of-screen violence , but some gore should please those who found the original SC lacking in this department . Fans of the franchise ( . . which I'm not ) might find this irresistible , because RETURN feels positively dated , attempting futilely ( . . in my opinion , at least ) at sophomoric humor , failing miserably . Cast of really obnoxious teens and profane adults couldn't die fast enough as far as I was concerned . Perhaps many will feel this captures the wacky spirit of the original , RETURN is an aimless exercise highlighting the crude and unruly behavior / shenanigans of the camp's teenagers . . the adults who are supposed to be in charge of supervising these brats are about as bad , if not worse . The film feels like it was written by 13 year olds and we are witnesses to wedgies , lighted farts , fat-jokes / gags , and other grating activities . As I pointed out already , I'm pretty sure a whole bawdy crowd will embrace this with open arms just for it featuring returning " stars " , Paul DeAngelo as counselor Ronnie ( . . still in stunning athletic shape , but still lacking in the acting department ) , Jonathan Tiersten as Ricky ( . . blond this time , still needing his mouth washed out with soap ) and special guest Felissa Rose as Angela in a cameo ( . . and in another secret role as well ) . WE have a sheriff often popping up after murders take place trying to keep everyone civil as a killer is on the loose . The identity of the killer will surprise no one unless you are REALLY that gullible and / or easily fooled . Sad and unfortunate , this was Isaac Hayes ' last role , playing a very disgruntled cook . Vincent Pastore is the lead camp counselor with a special fondness for his pet bird he often embraces with a kiss .
436345	9938570	124102	2.0	Dee Snider's Strangeland	Now this is one sick puppy . If there ever was a totally worthless film , STRANGELAND is just that . Dee Snider's name is all over this dreck regarding a sicko with a body modification fetish who uses the internet to lure victims to his home where he bounds them in his basement , torturing them through the use of hooks and other metallic weapons which pierce / penetrate flesh . I'm not sure what crowd this caters to besides those fascinated with the film's content . Dee Snider , in a positively dreadful performance , portrays the weirdo of the film , Carleton Hendricks who used the internet name Capt Howdy ( . . from THE EXORCIST ) on a teen chat site to communicate with girls and boys . Mike Gage ( Hevin Gage ) becomes personally involved with the case of Hendricks when his beautiful daughter Genevieve ( Linda Cardellini ) is kidnapped and tortured by the freak . Gage needs help from a niece ( Amy Smart ) regarding the hunt for his culprit because he's not exactly tech / internet savvy . Gage's wife is portrayed by Elizabeth Peña . Robert Englund is a white trash caricature , Jackson Roth , who stirs up a mob who hang Hendricks after he's released from an asylum , later becoming a target when Carleton doesn't die . Barbara Champion is a Christian group leader who also becomes a victim of Hendricks ' , attending his lynching , voicing her disapproval for his being released on the streets . The opening of the film elaborates Hendricks ' lifestyle , his torture lair , and Gage's pursuit in catching him . Then after he's caught through some stellar detective work by Gage , the court lets him out after about three years in an institution which itself is a load of hogwash . Embarrassingly , we are supposed to accept that Hendricks would transform into a timid , shy brand new human being from the sadistic scumbag he once was , in a sick way of garnering sympathy once he's treated to a wrongful lynching . Oh , and his pills are what help keep Capt Howdy at bay . . once he loses his pills , Howdy emerges and those who attempted to lynch him are in for a world of hurt . And , the film attempts to have us believe that Hendricks would be able to kidnap Genevieve again . . this was simply unacceptable as far as I'm concerned , that Carleton could be able to secure Genevieve once again so rather easily . Anyway , it's written by Snider so what do you expect ? The film is brutal featuring skin often torn through by hooks and we often see mouths stitched shut , as victims can not cry out for help . Carleton's mouth is constantly spouting gibberish regarding his insane philosophies . Film emphasizes the threat that the internet poses towards teenagers who incite gatherings with mysterious people they do not even know . . that message does have relevance , but it's muddied within such an ugly freakshow . The film awakens us to an entire subculture , regarding those who embrace external expression ( . . the term " modern primitives " ) through tattoos and piercings .
436675	9938570	85224	2.0	The Being	One eyed blob monster , a product of the usual toxic waste dumping ( . . as mayor José Ferrer put it so adequately , Pottsville was chosen by Industrial governmental scientist Martin Landau as " the most sophisticated dump site in the country . " ) , with slobbery sharp teeth and terribly sensitive to light , attack the locals by wrapping it's lizard tongue around their throats , whisking them out of the camera frame . Sheriff Bill Osco , who dresses like a truck driver , even when at the town station , is to the rescue , ready to kill the monster if he doesn't bore him to death first with his non-performance and monotone voice . The blob monster could very well be the son of a haggard Dorothy Malone . Meanwhile Mayor Ferrer's wife Ruth Buzzi is having Easter egg hunts with the children , holding rallies against the new massage parlor coming to town supposedly advocating an arrival of filth to the community , and holding an opera within her home for a gathering of town folk . Marianne Gordon , who seems to escape the embarrassment in a low-key performance as a waitress and possible love-interest to Osco ( . . why she'd even be interested in someone as lively as a block of wood is anyone's guess ) , will be the woman in peril who would eventually walk Malone home and never be seen in the film again . Now , to take a moment to talk about Landau . I think we can use " The Being " as an educational tool on how a prominent actor , at the very bottom of his career starring in this cinematic equivalent of a toilet bowl with fresh smelly turds , can rise from the ashes like a Phoenix thanks to two directors , Woody Allen ( . . in probably the finest performance of his career , " Crimes and Misdemeanors " ) & Tim Burton ( " Ed Wood " ) . I actually think Ferrer , last seen in this film driving off , quite wasted and frightened after seeing the blob monster , plays his role a bit tongue-in-cheek as a constantly annoyed Mayor who just wants to grow his potatoes and make his little town a wealthy place to earn a spot in Washington . Buzzi , is and always will be , Buzzi . . she is the busybody always organizing something , and is aggravating as ever . I imagine that those still populating drive-ins as this flick came out ( . . I'm guessing , temporarily ) probably cheered when Buzzi was on her way out of the picture . I think Dorothy Malone is a sex icon thanks to her work with Douglas Sirk , specifically her delicious nymphomaniac in " Written in the Wind " , but is handed a terribly thankless ( . . practically meaningless , if the script hadn't made her son the one effected by the toxic waste ) role in this steaming pile . On Jackie Kong's directorial decisions come a narrative voice at the opening after a radio DJ tells us about rain showers and thunderstorms moving into the area , prophetically announces doom to the little town of Pottsville , Idaho . She also gives us a run-down at what the surviving characters did with their lives after the incident at Pottsville is over . The climactic showdown between the hilarious monster and Osco should earn some good laughs . This hunk of excrement will probably work the best for fans of rancid schlock . I did find the drive-in sequence near the beginning pretty fun . . the movie playing equals " The Being " in quality which I find irony in . There's an attack scene where the monster , in gelatinous form , oozes from the air conditioning vents and radio to somehow kill a couple making out . It also puts an arm through a deputy holding his heart . Most victims , though , are pulled away by the thing . Best kill is probably the poor kid who tries to escape the monster getting his head removed .
436699	9938570	127282	2.0	Shrieker	Hunk of trash only the Full Moon Studios could make has a group of college kids , staying for free in an old hospital with no one knowing , as a demonic creature with two faces ( barely visible the entire film because of incomprehensible lighting ) passes through walls killing each member who has a certain sheet of paper with ancient markings . Someone amongst them ( it won't be too hard to prove , but a slight twist is so uninspiringly revealed and limply executed you'll just scoff ) is the mastermind behind who the beast kills and must be revealed before it kills everyone . Cheap , badly acted mess has a " That's it ? ! " kind of weak ending that'll have you exasperated at why you just wasted your time . Tanya Dempsey , who couldn't act her way through a wet paper sack , has the heroine duties as the newest member of the college rooming bunch named Clark . Oh , and the title refers to the sound the beast makes before it attacks it's next victim .
436373	9938570	96426	3.0	Waxwork	David Lincoln ( David Warner ) sells his soul to the devil and murders the ancestor of Mark ( Zach Galligan ) at the beginning by putting his head in the fireplace as it was burning wood . Mark , Sarah ( Deborah Foreman ) , China ( Michelle Johnson ) & Tony ( Dana Ashbrook ) decide to got to a Midnight showing of a Waxworks . . this is a " museum " whose proprietor is Lincoln who hasn't aged a bit . Each museum exhibit is actually a gateway into another time where the classic monsters of horror await those who enter and are gullible to believe that these creatures can harm them . You have the worst Dracula in the history of cinema in Miles O'Keeffe , horrible werewolf costume representing John Rhys-Davies , J Kenneth Campbell as the Marquis de Sade turned into a cartoon , and the Mummy . Other creatures such as an alien , zombies , and Frankenstein's monster never get their full due because director Hickox can not slow the movie down enough to provide us with any kind of substance to hold a hat on . I swear this film is held together by plywood and string . Poor Patrick Macnee must do with a character called Sir Wilfred who has been planning an attack on Lincoln for sometime . The film is episodic showing what each character faces as they enter ( . . or are thrown into ) each exhibit . There's plenty of gore and the lovely Deborah Foreman is probably enough to give this film a go . Obviously lovers of the classic Universal horrors might find some worth in this drivel , but I have a feeling they will find the make-up work of these creatures as laughable to the point of disrespect . The whole film ends with Wilfred's unit of " soldiers " doing battle with the monsters once they are released from their " cages " after the museum is provided with enough souls by those who venture into the other world . It's a mess of bodies and violence that can become unbearable .
436291	9938570	974583	3.0	Lake Placid 2	A sheriff ( John Schneider , really stuck with some corner one liners when he blasts the monsters ) must contend with several large crocodiles which are eating locals . His past lady-love , Helen ( Sarah Lafleur ) , an animal conservationist , along with an egotistical wealthy hunter ( Sam McMurray ) and his sidekick Ahmed ( Joe Holt ) will assist the sheriff in his duties to take each croc out . They try to pry knowledge about these crocs from Sadie Bickerman ( Cloris Leachman , the only thing that works in this film is her nasty loathsome character who loves the crocs more than people ) who loves her " babies " and seems unwilling to give them jack squat . Making matters worse is that the sheriff's son ( Chad Collins ) , and his love-interest Kerri ( Alice Ziegler ) are fending for their lives after a couple of the crocs devoured their high school pals . Leave it to the always reliable Sci-Fi Channel to drop another rotten giant monster movie of low quality in our laps . . this one having the misfortune of being a sequel to the entertaining B-movie that came out year back from writer David E Kelley and director Steve Minor . While that film had a very enjoyable cast consisting of Bill Pullman , Bridget Fonda , Oliver Platt & especially scene-stealing Betty White ( . . Chloris plays Betty's sister in the sequel ) , this sequel has no-names with limited ability to even convey a minuscule of charm . It could be because the dialogue is so laughable and special effects so poor . How can anyone , much less Schneider proclaim the quip , " Afterwhile , Crocodile ! " and make it work ?
436653	9938570	35096	4.0	The Mummy's Tomb	Cheap , mediocre sequel to the successful " The Mummy's Hand " has presumably dead evil Professor Andoheb ( George Zucco ) preparing his predecessor Mehemet Bey ( Turhan Bey ) for the quest of revenge overseas to America using mummy Kharis ( Lon Chaney , Jr who has no reason being in the disguise . . any stunt man could do the same credible work lumbering around and choking victims ) in the goal of killing the surviving members of the Banning family whose patriarch Stephen ( Dick Foran ) and assistant Babe Hanson ( Wallace Ford ) retrieved the mummified corpse of Princess Ananka from her tomb in Egypt . . Andoheb considers this an outlandish act of desecration and wants the family to suffer for doing such an awful deed towards an ancient Egyptian custom . Bey and the mummy Kharis find a nice hideaway in a cemetery where the High Priest of Karnak can work as a caretaker in disguise . Every Full Moon , Bey will feed Kharis a form of liquid derived of several Tana leaves which will keep him not only alive but subservient to his master's wishes . Bey commands Kharis to kill Stephen and his sister Jane ( Mary Gordon ) , while also biding time for Babe to return so that he will become victim # 3 . Dr . John Banning ( John Hubbard ) plans to wed Isobel ( Elyse Knox ) , but doesn't know that Bey secretly covets his fiancé making plans to kidnap her with Kharis ' help . John's life is in danger because of his father . . he's also the last remaining member of the Banning line . If Bey has Isobel , there's no chance of any more Bannings being born . The police must find Kharis and the one responsible for his carnage . . Bey . This film is a continuation from HAND set years later as members of that film , Foran , Ford & Zucco all appear in " aging " make-up providing wrinkles showing the gaps in time as Andoheb has been preparing for the deaths of the Bannings . The cornball romance of John and Isobel seems merely in this plot so that Bey will screw up endangering his perfect plan which was being carried out successfully before he loused it up . And , Bey merely sees her frolicking with John on the grass . . the whole " love-at-first-sight " rubbish really didn't wash for me . Plus you have the mummy being able to kill people with one arm . . is any mummy really THAT powerful ? This film also uses a ton of footage from the previous film to save budget on this sequel to it . There really isn't that much story here and yes , typical of Universal monster pictures , even in America a mob of people will light . . ho hum . . torches going after Kharis . You know how it'll end . . John and the super-powerful Kharis will square off in some huge mansion with fire burning all around them with the evil one being engulfed in flame .
435883	9938570	122070	4.0	The Forest	A truly disturbed , cannibalistic psychopath , John ( Gary Kent , under the pseudonym Michael Brody ) who lives in a cave , stalks campers who make the unfortunate mistake of backpacking in his wilderness . Steve ( Dean Russell ) and his buddy Charlie ( John Batis ) get into a playful argument with their wives , Sharon ( Tomi Barrett , the late real-life wife of Gary Kent ) ) & Teddi ( Ann Wilkinson ) over surviving in the woods camping by themselves . To prove a point , the gals decide to head for the wilderness out of Los Angeles for a camping trip disturbing their partners to the point that they soon follow afterward . Falling prey to John , Teddi is soon killed as Sharon runs for her life as the men arrive late to the wilderness due to their truck's overheating . Afraid , tired , and paranoid , Sharon receives some very unusual assistance . . John's ghost children ! That's right , John's children remain in the wilderness , ghostly apparitions which spy on those who exist in the woods , taking a special liking to Sharon , helping guide her to safety and her friends . Meanwhile , Steve and Charlie soon find shelter from a down pour and the darkness of night in the very cave where John lives . Cooking over a burning fire , the meat simmering is actually from Charlie's wife , Teddi ! Unknowingly Charlie eats from the meat when offered by John who finds the outsiders inside his dwelling place ! Anyway , soon , worried about their wives , Steve and Charlie set out to find them as morning breaks . Meanwhile , John goes a hunting , with Charlie , Steve , and Sharon in a fight for survival . When Steve suffers a compound fracture stumbling between two massive rocks over a flowing river , he will be handicapped only increasing such an already nightmare scenario , with Sharon following her ghostly young friends to potential safety . . they even , at one point , plead with their father to not kill her . Charlie , unfortunately , doesn't have such friends . Director Donald Jones ( . . who also wrote it and went broke funding the film ) smartly shoots the film in such a breathtaking , gorgeous location in the Sequoia National Park , in California , where those gargantuan trees tower to great heights , and I basically watch backwoods slashers for this very purpose . For some strange reason , I didn't particularly find Jones ' direction of the setting very atmospheric . . the dread was missing , although there are some rather disturbing attacks by John using his knife ( . . shot in a clever way , Jones ' camera suggests more than what is actually on screen , yet , somehow , still achieves that gasp at what John is doing to victims ) . Within such a picturesque landscape , to see innocents preyed upon by a maniac , that kind of increases the terror . City folk attempting to spend a nice few days in a different place , to smell the clean , fresh air , enjoy the sights of a lovely view , only to find themselves stalked by a creepy predator with a very intimidating knife . Providing the back-story to why John is the monster he is , Jones allows us to witness his memory flashback in discovering his wife's adultery and reacting accordingly ( . . she is also a ghost in the wilderness looking for her children , wishing to punish them for " being naughty " ) killing both her and the lover in bed ( . . a refrigerator repairman ) . The children , sad and depressed committed suicide and now " haunt " the wilderness , still interacting with their pa or whoever they so choose . I realize such a novelty as ghost children in a backwoods slasher is unique and appreciated by some , but I found the idea rather hokey and too silly to take serious . They do help our heroine escape a few potentially dangerous situations , but it was awfully hard for me to keep from giggling uncontrollably . The music I found hideously 80's and the performances aren't mind-blowing . I mean I could react to the situation they were in , because it is indeed quite terrifying to find yourselves in an unfamiliar and hostile territory being hunted by someone who knows the area so well . I think the film is similar in many ways to DON'T GO INTO THE WOODS . . ALONE ! , except that THE FOREST has the aforementioned ghost children ( . . their voices echo when talking to Sharon , their father , or each other ) . Gary Kent looks like a filthy George Lucas , with tattered clothes , and humanity lost . As I mentioned above , the violence isn't as grisly as what is suggested because director Jones is able to effectively cut away from a great deal of knife penetration , yet the way he stages the set pieces leave you rather unsettled ( . . such as Teddi's murder , the violence mostly silhouetted on the surface of a nearby huge stone formation , her pleas for John to stop and , once stabbed several times , attempts to crawl away from her predator only to be finished off ; a hanging corpse John is skinning ) . I've seen better and worse of this type of slasher film , it's rather mediocre , at best , with some effectively shot scenery . I don't really think it's particularly memorable , for the exception of the ghost children .
436035	9938570	209264	4.0	Python	The town of Ruby and it's surrounding country-side are terrorized by a giant python created by the typical secret government organization called Biogene which was released after a plane carrying it crash-lands . Dr . Anton Rudolph ( Robert Englund , who gets all the theatrical dialogue ) , who had a part in creating this massive reptile through variations of serpents , informs Agent-in-charge Bart Parker ( Casper Van Dien , far removed from " Starship Troopers " or " Sleepy Hollow " ) that it's practically unkillable and very fast with a nasty venomous acid-spit you wouldn't believe . Pro-biker John ( Frayne Rosanoff ) and deputy Greg ( William Zabka , known for playing blonde haired bullying punks in the 80's such as in " Karate Kid " & " Back to School " ) who have angst over a chick named Kristin ( Dana Barron , one of many variations of Griswald daughter Audrey in " National Lampoon's Vacation " ) must join forces to stop the python . Could easily play on Sci-fi channel with it's low quality computer effects of the monstrous python . The python really is never convincing which makes the film play rather cheesy instead at all scary . The flick benefits from a cast of recognizable faces . Star Trek The Next Generation's Wil Wheaton plays a real-estate agent wannabe sporting a pink hair-do , Jenny McCarthy stops by to play a wealthy widow sexpot , Sean Whalen is a Barney Fife deputy , and Gary Grubbs ( my favorite of the cast who I enjoyed every moment he was on-screen ) as Sheriff Griffin Wade .
436452	9938570	963194	4.0	Repo ! The Genetic Opera	An alt-rock score , a hellish nightmarish world right out of The Crow , colorful , hideous characters who sing , comic interludes expressing past incidents which tell us why the story has culminated to the point we're witnessing , and the grisly operations of a repossessor of organs working for a futuristic tyrannical businessman who practically runs the goth city where the events take place . Paul Sorvino is an obvious choice for the role of Rotti Largo , an intense , contemptible , ruthless corporate giant whose face is perfectly etched with anger and disgust , rotten to the core and dying of a cancer progressively getting worse ( . . his duo of gun toting female guards shoot the doctor for bringing him the news , just a sign of how the state of life is in this depressing future ) . Anthony Head is his diabolical repo man , Nathan , who seeks out those who have signed a contract with Rotti for an organ they needed to live . . if these people fail to pay for their repaired organ , it'll be collected ( . . when Nathan viciously removes the organ , surgically , we can see the bar code ! ) Rotti took advantage of a terrible plight sweeping across the country , organ failures , and offered those afflicted hope , with a price . Nathan is held accountable for a past tragedy , caused by Rotti who was enraged at him for stealing away his bride , Marni . Using a poisonous drug , Rotti had it placed in the vial containing a formula Nathan was working on for his pregnant Marni who fell ill . Nathan , using the infected formula , instead causes the illness to worsen , needing to surgically remove their daughter , Shilo ( Alexa Vega ) before certain death . Caught by police for his actions in saving Shilo , Nathan must work for Rotti as a way of paying off his debt for saving him from prison . Rotti , ashamed of his horrible offspring , Amber Sweet ( Paris Hilton ) , Luigi Largo ( Bill Moseley ) , and Pavi ( Nivek Ogre ) wishes to leave his successful corporation , Geneco , to someone else . He sees this as an opportunity to get the ultimate revenge against Nathan who he hates with an overwhelming passion , for taking Marni away , by targeting a 17 year old Shilo , who has been isolated from the outside world , yearning to experience what life is like away from the prison of her apartment . Nathan has Shilo taking pills for a supposed blood disease , but , unknown to her , it's actually a poison ( . . he wishes for her to remain distant from a world he wants to shield her from ) and Rotti will take advantage of this situation so that he can turn daughter against father . And , Rotti has plans to leave his corporation to Shilo , for she is the only one he sees fit for such an enterprize . By drawing Shilo into the outside world promising her a cure for the blood disease , Rotti can successfully trap Nathan . Also , part of the plot has " Blind Mag " ( Sarah Brightman ) , a friend of Marni's , whose eyes were transplanted thanks to Geneco thanks in part of a contract she signed in blood , wishes to leave her singing career and have freedom from Rotti . Mag will meet Shilo with a domino effect transpiring . . it's only a matter of time before Shilo will discover the truth about her father's practices and the real reason behind the death of her mother . I think this is indeed a cult item , the songs will work for a certain crowd , as well as the grotesque costume designs , and the industrialized look of the world , fallen to ruin , degradation , and decadence . The alt-metal music which accompanies the songs will also work for that target cult audience . It's extremely graphic with some unsettling surgical organ removals . I personally found the music and singers horrid ( . . but that's because I'm not exactly a fan of musicals , especially with a cast who can not sing ) and the characters overbearing . This future , though , is not supposed to be a pleasant world , so the characters and what they have to sing about reflect this devastated society . Full of surgical freaks ( . . like Hilton's Amber ) , junkies ( . . addicted to a hypo-injected drug lifted from corpses called Zydrate ) , and hedonists . Moseley has his usual psychopath , Luigi , with an uncontrollable temperament , often stabbing folks who just so happen to cross him at the wrong time . Vegas has the central role , a pivotal part that inadvertently controls the inevitable confrontation between Nathan and Rotti . The character of Pavi ( . . and to a certain extent , Amber ) reminded me of Eyes Without a Face , with his face covered by a skin mask . . I kind of wondered if this was a homage of sorts . Hilton was expertly cast as a self-absorbed drug-addicted tramp who is obsessed with surgery , and with designs of being a star that takes the place of the beloved Mag . Director Darren Lynn Bousman shoots with soft focus photography , and the bleak world looks lifted right from a computer screen . Vega has an innocence and vulnerability that works for the part of an angel lost in a nightmare where fiends and miscreants lurk around every corner . The make-up effects are quite effective , particularly during those notorious organ removal sequences ( . . and a marvelous reveal of Amber's ruined visage ) .

His ex wife Anne ( Tricia O'Neil , who is actually quite good ) is a scuba instructor who loses one of her students when he decides , against warning , to search an old wreckage which housed the piranha . When dead bodies start to increase , Anne tries to warn Hotel Manager Raoul ( Ted Richart , who is basically representing the clichéd manager who doesn't respond well to warnings from his staff or police about possible harm to unknowing tourists for business purposes ) to no avail . She also begins an affair with Tyler Sherman ( Steve Marachuk ) who she finds out is a bio-chemist and one of those scientists responsible for creating the damn things eating people . Another horrifying element is that Anne and Steve's son , Chris ( Ricky Paull Golden ) is out there assisting a wealthy man's boat ride . Goofy sequel shows first-time director James Cameron ( who would , three years later , get it right with his awesome sci-fi action masterpiece , " The Terminator " ) was a bit green on how to create any sense of realism in this silly premise trying to make silly jokes work and his characters quirky . The film does have gore as these piranha behave like bats flying for the jugular ripping throats to shreds of victims . The sequence where tourists get slaughtered in one giant wallop of an attack is inspired and bloody . The film just can not escape it's ultra-silly idea . There ' s one scene that had me rolling in the floor at it's absurdity : a clean-up lady in a morgue catches a piranha in her throat as he plunges at her from the torso of a dead victim !
436160	9938570	95179	4.0	The New Blood : Friday the 13th VI	An emotionally fragile young woman , Tina ( Lar Park Lincoln ) , whose dangerous telekinetic powers led to the murder of her abusive father as a child , returns to Crystal Lake years later at the scene where that incident took place thanks to her demanding psychologist , Dr . Crews ( a delightfully slimy Terry Kiser , easily the most interesting character , and better than average performance , of the film ) who secretly plans to exploit her abilities when she's able to control them . In anger at the difficult situation she's facing , she releases a " telekinetic shockwave " which unleashes Jason Voorhees from the bouldered chain holding him captive underwater . Across from her cabin is a birthday celebration being held by a group of young adults who will unknowingly fall one by one to the hockey-masked psycho ready to pick up where he left off many years ago . If director John Carl Buechler had been able to deliver to franchise fans the version he made , this would be mentioned in the same breath as bloody slasher faves , " Maniac " & " The Prowler " ( . . even " The Prowler " director Joseph Zito's Friday film is allowed bloody rites ) . Having seen the deleted gore scenes , you can not help but feel slighted by those involved with censoring ( . . more like butchering ) this sequel . It's a shame because the deleted footage is in rather bad shape , having been buried in Paramount's vault unprotected for many years without much care it seems . There are some really inspired gory bits such as Jason forming his hands into a vice crushing one poor soul's skull like a walnut as blood squirts from the orifices of his face , one victim receiving a chopping ax to the face opening a gaping crevice with gushing blood , one man getting Jason's arm ran completely through him , and another penetrated through the stomach with a spinning saw blade . As is , the slasher film is mostly Jason killing victims off-screen , wiping away the make-up grue completed by the special effects company . What ultimately hurts this film is that the cast of victims attending a supposed birthday party ( . . and a few scattered victims elsewhere Jason runs into ) aren't very interesting at all , merely the same repeated clichés you expect in a sixth sequel to a franchise whose best days seem long past . If you don't have , at the very least , the gory bits inserted into the final product , what's the point of sitting through this umpteenth sequel ? This type of slasher product is specifically designed for Friday fans and gorehounds . . if this film isn't allowed to cater to those it's designed for , what is the point of releasing this film at all ? Anyway , the film's bread and butter has to be the special effects showcase at the end as Tina faces off with Jason . . for once , Jason is provided a worthy adversary who can oppose him . I think this is the only success of true note for Buechler , except some effective camera shots of Jason around cabins , in the woods , and following him as he closes in on those who are about to meet their maker . I do think Hodder is the best representation of Jason , and his make-up job ( both his rotting body and shredded outfit and facial work ) is great . The house explosion at the end is well executed as well . The rating I give the film is for the finished product forced against the director's wishes onto the viewer .
436508	9938570	283632	4.0	They	One of those " there's something hidden in the dark " kind of horror flicks ( . . like BOOGEYMAN ; 2005 ) , certainly not a choice for those with Nyctophobia . The film never fully spells out what " they " are so we must accept that the " night terrors " that plague our traumatized victims suffering sleep deprivation , are creatures from another type of world / dimension returning to collect those " marked " as children . Director Robert Harmon ( THE HITCHER ; 1986 ) never gives us an entire look of the creature . . just a silhouette of something in the distance moving around , barely recognizable , but just visible enough to allow you an idea that it is present and dangerous . Harmon establishes that what you do not see can be far more scary , or at least that seems to be his goal . . whether it works or not depends on the viewer , if you are gripped by what has beset the poor young adults . The film primarily focuses on Julia Lund ( Laura Regan ; MY LITTLE EYE ) , a psyche major , working on her thesis , whose phobia of the dark ( . . night terrors ) are reawakened after a friend from childhood blows his brains out right in front of her . Soon , Laura meets others who have similar problems with " those who hide in the dark " , Sam ( Ethan Embry ) & Terry ( Dagmara Dominczyk ) . We watch as this trio succumb to those hunting them because you can only run so long from the dark . Ambiguous and extremely grim conclusion left me rather torn . . in a way , I applaud not always letting our lead off the hook in a daring decision by the filmmakers , yet I would've liked to have understood why the creatures ever returned the kids to start with . And , if they were afraid of the light , how could they cause power to go off ? And , what's the reason behind waiting until the characters reached 25 ? The level of uncertainty in the psychology of the creatures themselves makes so little sense , I'm kind of bewildered at what causes them to act the way they do . Maybe , that's beside the point altogether . . it's not about why they come after these characters it's about their pursuit period . Most will overlook the details , focus on the monsters themselves , and watch in horror as the characters attempt futilely to escape to no avail . Marc Blucas is Paul , Julia's paramedic boyfriend who worries about her worsening mental state . Jay Brazeau is Julia's old psychiatrist , Dr . Booth , attempting to help her snap out of what he considers an emotional crisis due to her friend's suicide , and how she couldn't rescue him from such a decision . Another one of those flicks boasting credits featuring Wes Craven's name ( . . which was a hot commodity at the time ) .
435992	9938570	480249	5.0	I Am Legend	A plague sweeps across the world and renders civilization a mass of dead and infected savages ( . . named Darkseekers who only hunt at night with an inability to withstand sunlight it seems ) , a survivor , Doctor Robert Neville ( Will Smith ) seeks a cure , working effortlessly in his lab , slowly losing hope of ever achieving such a feat . He also often hunts the Darkseekers at night , setting traps to capture live specimens so that he can attempt to cure them . During the struggle to find a cure , Neville's resolve and courage begin to dwindle , and his need for human interaction are proving to become his undoing . Rather simply and predictably told , with CGI creatures which look like characters from a video game , it's Smith's riveting performance that keeps this rather weak interpretation afloat . Some action / thriller elements are delivered somewhat well as Neville finds himself in life-threatening situations with the Darkseekers . Alice Braga and Charlie Tahan are Anna and Ethan , mother and son survivors who enter Neville's life towards the middle of the film as he , in desperation and despair , almost kills himself by driving straight into an army of Darkseekers . Smith is able to convey a sense of loss and a desperate need for companionship with the film expressing a quiet , devastated New York City . Smith's work opposite his pet companion , Samantha , are really effective and his scene with a department store mannequin echo The Twilight Zone episode , Is There Anybody Out There ? But , you've seen this all before and the film really doesn't set itself apart from other films which focused on the same type of Matheson story . Still Smith does what is required of him and the film benefits from such a performance even if the special effects are not up to par .
436040	9938570	462485	5.0	Poultrygeist : Night of the Chicken Dead	Director Lloyd Kaufman returns with another no-holds-barred gore-fest , completely tongue-in-cheek , with plenty of offensive jokes and gags to ridicule nearly every kind of religion and race . Wherever you stand , this film likely pokes fun at you . Parts musical ( ! ) with characters bursting into song at certain points during the plot ( . . or what plot there is ) . A chicken restaurant is built on an ancient Indian burial ground , but this is used merely as an excuse to enact some of the most sickening acts of violence you could ever hope for , even seeing humans transforming into sadistic cannibalistic beaked birds . The film centers around nerd Arbie ( Jason Yachanin ) who is irate at his girlfriend's new position as both a lesbian and vegetarian , whose latest lay is an activist against that chicken restaurant on the burial ground . Arbie takes a job at the place in revenge , but agonizes over her leaving him for another , the choice being a woman even infuriates him more . Wendy doesn't know her lover's true motivations , which have a lot to do with the franchise their protesting . The chicken become " infected " by eggs carrying " evil spirits " ( . . more like a type of green goo , often seen in Troma films ) and when customers eat the food they hideously deform into birds with an appetite for human flesh . We are privy to the siege on the restaurant , Arbie's fellow co-workers falling prey to the infection , and his attempts to protect Wendy as zombie chicken humans attempt to rip apart anyone human . As always , Kaufman finds every kind of way to shock and disgust , through grotesque gore-murders and parodying political and religious people in equal measure . I think his main target are both vegetarians and meat-eaters , many often killed in hideous methods imaginable . As you'd expect , the cast know what kind of movie they're in and perform in that fashion . Kate Graham goes all out as Arbie's love , Wendy , but , to me , Allyson Sereboff was frighteningly skinny as her lesbian lover Micki . Robin Watkins , as corrupt businessman General Lee Roy , grins wide and sends up the hick image with gusto , wearing white and deceiving his customers , knowing that his product has been corrupted by something poisonous and dangerous to humans . There's an orgy of violence and sex in one lengthy sequence where the customers who ate polluted chicken either turn into bird-zombies or those human casualties who are torn into for consumption . Kaufman has lots of grotesque mutations springing from the human bodies reaction to turning into birds . There were times where I thought I was gonna hurl . One victim sprouts " egg-breasts " hatching chicks ! A person's face is pulled off . A broom is stabbed completely through a bird-zombie's crotch . A victim is pushed into a slicer with blood and flesh ( . . and a leg ) spraying all over the restaurant kitchen . A victim's face is forced into a slicer . I could go on and on . Zombie fans craving flesh eating will be satisfied . In other words , if you are a gorehound , then this flick will give you plenty to cheer about . I could do without the musical numbers and many of the jokes and gags fall flat , but it often made me cringe , and I did find the overall film amusing . Jihad or Catholic Priest , gay or straight , black or white , everyone is skewered , Troma fans should be in heaven . Kaufman has a funny supporting part as Arbie in a few decades , reminding him that this is not the career one should strive for . To describe the film's tastelessness , an employee at the restaurant , screws a dead chicken , before it was to be prepared for cooking , with it possessed and growing into a monster on his crotch !
436041	9938570	72626	5.0	House of the Dead	An adulterer , Talmudge ( John Ericson ) attempting to find his hotel , instead is left by his taxi driver in the rain nearby a mortuary , it's mortician offering him refuge from the storm . While inside , our mortician relates the fates of four customers to him and we are all witnesses to what happened to them . Low budget anthology , perhaps too cheap to really be that effective . Most of the tales presented lack strong story-telling and end way too abruptly . Clearly modeled after the Amicus chillers . I have no idea why this was called " Alien Zone . " The first and second tales really leave much to be desired . A school teacher who hates children ( ! ) finds herself besieged within her very home by those very ones she so despises . The kids ( . . at first wearing clown masks , evoking Michael Myers from Halloween , later carrying the appearance of possible vampiric ghouls ) as they close in on their prey , cornering her as the camera distorts the frame , colors out of control , is quite thrilling , even if what leads up to it isn't . The second tale consists of a psychotic photographer who records women he kills on a movie camera . The fourth tale , which doesn't make a hell of a lot of sense , displays an office employee being subjected to torture within a building complex , rooms with trap doors and walls of spikes . The wraparound story between the mortician and Talmudge won't fool anybody . Talmudge , at the beginning , is shown in bed with an unhappily married woman and inside the mortuary , he follows the mortician as he opens the coffin lids exposing the victims of the tales we watch to him ( . . their bodies are not shown to the viewer , but Talmudge's facial mannerisms express enough through perplexity and disgust to lend us a helping hand in how they look ) . The third , and in my opinion easily far-and-away the best , is what I call , The Case of the Duelling Detectives featuring Scotland Yard's finest detective , Inspector McDowal ( Bernard Fox ) tagging along with New York's finest Private Investigator , Malcolm Toliver ( Charles Aidman ) as he pursues the identity of a specific criminal who is threatening to kill someone he knows with only a note consisting of letters cut from magazine articles as the means for solving the mystery . The two actors , Fox and Aidman , turn in delightful performances as foes , quite the egomaniacs often sparring intellectually with each other , who hurl gentlemanly insults at each other regarding which detective indeed is the very best of his profession and the result of the mystery ( . . although I'm sure many will know the answer ) is most appropriate considering their vanity .
435823	9938570	85636	5.0	Halloween : Season of the Witch	A rambling unhealthy old man , clutching a specific Halloween mask , stumbles into a Northern California hospital claiming that a toy factory is " going to kill us all . " This declaration remains buried in the mind of doc on call that night , Dr . Dan Challis ( Tom Atkins , in his first starring role ) who is certainly bothered when a mysterious man , in a business suit , enters the hospital killing the old patient by snapping his cranium before dousing himself with gasoline setting his body on fire , exploding the car in the parking lot . The dead old man's daughter , Ellie ( . . the sexy small-framed Stacey Nelkin ) wishes to know why her father was killed in such a vicious . . and suspicious . . manner and convinces Challis to pursue the truth behind his claims of malicious intent regarding the mask in his possession . Tracing his previous steps indicate the old man was in Santa Mira , hometown to the Silver Shamrock toy factory whose chairman , Conal Cochran ( Dan O'Herlihy , in a chilling performance , portraying him in a sly , all-smiles manner , unveiling his sinister side as the movie continues ) is the major name in the Halloween mask business . Challis and Ellie find that Santa Mira is quite a silent , guarded place , where the citizens keep to themselves and the streets remain mostly quiet . Cameras are everywhere and a curfew keeps the townsfolk in doors at a certain part at night . They will soon find that Cochran is running a corrupt operation where the manufactured children masks being shipped to stores all across American contain a gadget ( . . carrying the Silver Shamrock logo ) holding tiny particles from a stolen statue of Stonehenge which unleash bugs and snakes killing those kids who watch a specific commercial which houses a signal while wearing them over their heads . Will Challis and Ellie stop Cochran's plan or will all the children who tune in be wiped out as a part of an ancient Celtic form of sacrifice ? I'll be the first to admit that this film had me biting my nails to the quick . That pulse-pounding score from Carpenter & Howard really does the trick , the electronic beat moves the viewer along with a sense of urgency and builds dread for those who face potential danger . Writer-director Tommy Wallace benefits from his association with Carpenter and Debra Hill because Dean Cundy provides fabulous cinematography which gives this rather okay effort a stunning visual polish masking certain problems . Also , having Atkins as a very capable leading man doesn't hurt as well . This film was a real chance for Wallace and Atkins to show what they were made of . The flaws of the story are enormous , but the film's initial premise is indeed terrifying . . the idea that a mask can cause insects and snakes to destroy your child while wearing it really gives you a reason to root for Atkins . Atkins gives you the kind of reactions anyone might have when facing such a bizarre crisis as the truths he uncovers . The whole Stonehenge part , how such creatures can come from a gadget on a mask , how these gadgets can wipe out Cochran's multitude of mandroids yet a certain one somehow survives ( . . this ( wo ) mandriod must've been a better model ) , why Cochran wouldn't just kill Challis right away instead of toying with him like a villain would James Bond , the logistical time-frame problems of kids in different time-zones . . all these screenplay problems open up crater-size flaws which aggrevate . Yet , the spooky Santa Mira town really is quite an interesting backdrop which echoes Carpenter's " Escape from New York " as mandroids stationed throughout appear on the far side of the screen or from the shadows . This film has an unpleasant tone of menace regarding how the mandroids kill innocents who might so happen to compromise Cochran's operation ( . . such as how a forensics scientist is drilled through the skull , how one hobo's head is pulled from his neck ) . The climax , which does allow Challis a chance to strike back against his captors , has a rather grim end which might leave you sad or horrified . The mandroids , when damaged , resemble the android who is destroyed in " Alien " .
435876	9938570	409999	5.0	Gargoyle-Wings of Darkness	Underneath a Romanian Catholic church's graveyard lies a breeding ground of eggs containing gargoyles an evil priest is harvesting for Armegeddon as the mother creature is out flying the skies looking for victims to munch on . Michael Paré and Sandra Hess are American agents working on a case regarding a criminal who was snatched away by the mother gargoyle monster , trying to determine what had caused his death , among a string of attacks concerning the beast . Kate Orsini is an art curator helping to restore and modernize the Catholic church where creepy corrupt priest Fintan McKeown is secretly working against his clergy hoping to unleash an army of hatched gargoyles on an unsuspecting public . Petri Roega is a priest sent by the Vatican to replace McKeown and indeed knows what his plans are . Paré will hook up with Orsini after reporting to her after learning about her missing co-workers . . in their search for truth regarding bizarre crime scenes and elaborate pictures of gargoyles found in a book of study on McKeown's desk ( . . not to mention Orsini's discovery of a missing painting hidden in the Catholic church she is working on containing a gargoyle ) they will soon learn about a special crossbow and blood-blessed arrows meant to use on the mother gargoyle sweeping down and snatching human food . Tim Abell , a Wynorski regular , has a supporting role as Lex , a showman who passes himself off as a cult leader of vampirism finding a devoted following of goth-obsessed flunkies who frequent his club for kicks . Abell sees himself what the gargoyle can do when it swoops down taking out a gang of thugs who wish to take over Bucharest's streets . Another Wynorski regular Arthur Roberts has a small role as a Bishop who lives within the ruins of a castle on the outskirts of Bucharest who holds the special crossbow and gives knowledge to Paré and Orsini regarding the gargoyle on the loose . Serious creature feature from Wynorski plays it completely straight unlike his usual efforts , certainly relies heavily on computer generated monsters which look more like giant bats when cloaked in the darkness of night or within the catacombs underneath the graveyard . Wynorski does , when given a chance , direct films geared towards fans of sci-fi / horror / action , but rarely has sufficient funds to finance a feature with superior special effects . When the gargoyle charges towards the camera , that's when the computer generated effects are truly exposed . Wynorski actually focuses more on plot than usual with a cast keeping a straight face with Paré coasting on his charisma . I think fans of Sci-fi channel monster movies will find this better than most of their usual fare , but I'm not sure that's an insult or a compliment for Wynorski's movie . I love gargoyles , but even the finest CGI monster would pale in comparison to the animatronic wonders created by the ingenuity and artistic skill of the crew for the " Lover's Vow " tale in Tales from the Darkside-The Movie ( 1990 ) . Like other directors who wish not to give their correct name in the directorial credit , Wynorski uses the alias of Jay Andrews . The movie doesn't really separate itself from the gluttony of monster movies that have populated Sci-fi channel over the years so don't expect any really big surprises .
436091	9938570	294594	5.0	The Gathering	Christina Ricci stars as an American , Cassie , who is hit by a car belonging to the wife of a art restorer ( . . . and investigator ) , Simon Kirkman ( Stephen Dillane ) who is currently working on a top-secret project regarding the restoration of a first century church buried under earth . This church , Simon discovers , was built by Joseph of Arimathea and features the faces of a gathering of on lookers who came to the crucifixion to simply watch out of idle curiosity . It is believed that the gathering were condemned ( . . by God ? ) to wander the centuries , forced to watch the same kind of horrifying acts of violence to victims as they had during Christ's crucifixion . Something in the town of Ashby Wake is going to happen and Cassie , who can not remember much about her past , has terrible premonitions regarding certain citizens suffering brutal fates . Cassie has taken to Simon's quiet son , Michael ( Harry Forrester ) , almost mute thanks to the death of his beloved mother , and , after seeing a premonition of his own demise , sets out to stop the future act with the best of her ability . A rather imposing local mechanic , Argyle ( Peter McNamara ) , Cassie discovers , was molested by his priest and certain drunken citizens as a child , and she believes he will be behind something seriously sinister , hoping to stop him before he carries it out . She meets a likable chap who lives nearby ( . . he tells her ) named Dan ( Ioan Gruffudd ) and Cassie opens up to him about her troubling premonitions and he seems supportive , but is he really an avenger for her cause ? And , how come Cassie escaped being seriously hurt after the car hit her to begin with ? Can she save Michael and stop Argyle ? To be honest I found the premise totally silly and couldn't take it seriously . But , it is a well-made thriller that builds over time , filling in the blanks , using Ricci as our guide , along with the priest ( Simon Russell Beale ) who makes some startling discoveries regarding familiar faces which show up during several various places " to watch " horrifying deaths calculated by a supreme being who forces the gathering to forever wander in time . The film , for a while , has two alternating stories , the restoration of Joseph's church and Cassie's attempts to stop a potential disaster , with them intersecting when the faces of the gathering become better known . But , for a long period of time , director Brian Gilbert and writer Anthony Horowitz maintain a heavy level of ambiguity , providing clues using premonitions , ominous faces , past memories detailing a disturbing truth which fuels the violent rampage at the end , and a heroine with several mysteries of her own which slowly unravel as the disturbing event draws near . The themes of fate and redemption are explored and Ricci's Cassie , through her amnesia , can perhaps change an event that's set to happen , unlike the gatherers who merely await in the background to watch it all unfold . It's quite an odd concept I found rather hard to swallow , but I'm pretty sure many will find it to be thought-provoking and intriguing . Like BLESS THE CHILD , not one of Christina Ricci's better known films , but might be entertaining for fans of spiritual thrillers .
435865	9938570	93626	5.0	Nightflyers	Michael D'Brannin ( John Standing ) has a great vision and that is to find a certain form of alien life / intelligence but needs a space vessel to seek it out . The ship he's able to find is captained supposedly by a mysterious man named Royd ( Michael Praed ) who won't reveal himself in person to the crew . Miranda ( Catherine Mary Stewart who I thought was just fine ) is a head-strong woman who is D'Brannin's confident , a person who believes in him and his life's goal & desire . The rest of the crew are not as assured of this mission , but go along with the ride anyway . They are mostly made up of tech-heads who wish to understand Royd more and try various ways to get more information about him . Then there's a woebegone Class-10 telepath Jon ( the always watchable , flashy , flamboyant Michael Des Barres ripping to shreds every scene he's in ) who believes he's found an evil presence on board the ship , at it's very core . This " seething malignant presence " hates the crew , Jon informs them in shouting tirades as he has " linked " with the very evil itself . Royd has found a person to confide in with Miranda , obviously a woman he's also attracted to . He finds her doing gymnastics ( perhaps one of the few times the film really pursues character development by placing a past to a person ) and is intrigued by her and the things Miranda has to say . Royd informs her that he is in fact a clone , created by a woman he calls " Mother " who died before the chamber birthing him completed it's cycle . Royd wishes to leave his ship and realizes that his immunity system is so weak he'll probably die leaving the ship , but his feeling of imprisonment makes his decision easier . His desire to do this makes the evil presence on the ship erupt as it's obvious who it is that is behind the violence that will take place . . Mother . Jon wishes to " take over " the ship and believes he can defeat the evil that is control at the present . . big mistake . He is instead controlled by Mother and forced to attempt the murder on the one she believes is responsible for putting thoughts of leaving in Royd's head . . Miranda . The rest of the crew are merely fodder for her death belt . From Jon we find out what is indeed behind the evil . . somehow the woman who created Royd transfered her consciousness and will into the ship's core meaning that it's her who controls the ship and it's computer . Somewhere on the ship lies her power and it must be destroyed or else everyone perishes . Yeah , it's rather mediocre , but I never found it to be as bad as everyone else posting user comments does . Now , this could be because I haven't read the book it's based on . I'll admit , there isn't much character development and the crew , for the most part , are merely here to serve as victims for the " Mother of evil " . Lisa Blount who portrays Audrey , the crew member who questions nearly everything , especially the trustworthiness of Royd , is feisty enough , but a bit grating at the same time . James Avery ( as Darryl , the cook who gets his fingers taken off in a kitchen explosion during one of Mother's emotional outbursts and then later re-applied during a surgery scene ) tries hard in the role of token black guy who serves as emotional center to the nervous crew members who do not trust Royd or the other goings-on on board this alien ship . Glenn Withrow is Keelor , the nerd who understands the engineering side of things and has a scene where he finds the massive schematics of the computer showing us what they're up against . Hélène Udy is Lilly , the computer wiz mostly seen punching keys trying to get at what makes Royd ( . . and the ship ) tick . Annabel Brooks is Jon's telepathic lover , Eliza . There's one great sequence where someone possessed by Mother attempts to kill Miranda and during the struggle gets his arm sliced off & face broken apart by a renegade laser . Another poor soul is sucked out into space when , in another one of her emotional tirades , Mother opens the cargo bay doors . During that tirade , Royd is able , he thinks , to stop Mother , but not before the cargo bay is breached meaning it must be patched before the ship implodes . So you know that going outside the ship is very necessary . . is Mother really dead ? I thought some of the special effects sequences were just fine and the murkiness of the ship's interior isn't something I was bothered by . It could've been better , I assume , since many consider this an abomination to a good novel . Whoever made this probably didn't have the money or proper resources to make the kind of ambitious project that novel needed .
436098	9938570	63272	5.0	Mantis in Lace	Cheeky smut is perfect entertainment for sleaze aficionados . Photographed by Bogdanovich's frequent cinematographer László Kovács whose experiments with psychedelic colors during Lila's ( Susan Stewart ) drug trips are quite an experience . The film concerns the homicidal tendencies of a stripper triggered by LSD during Lila's sexual confrontations with men in a candle-lit abandoned warehouse for rent . Lila picks up various males for whom she encounters at the club she works , an unusual assortment of men , who have no idea what lies in store for them as they take part in passionate love-making as she succumbs to possible past incidents which re-awaken as the LSD overtakes her senses . After stabbing the men she beds with a screwdriver , Lila chops their bodies up with a cleaver disposing of the corpses in cardboard boxes in the warehouse , leaving them in vacant areas . The film shows two weary detectives pressed into solving the serial killings , this rash of homicides is growing in number and Lila shows no signs of stopping . The acting is obviously sub-par with this dime-store cast of unknown faces and the dialogue leaves anything to be desired . Stewart , in the lead as Lila , is quite beautiful ( . . often bearing her breasts during rather lackluster dance-routines ) yet rather vacuous . The film luridly shows the club crowd's enthusiastic reactions to the performance artists on stage as they bare their breasts for the public . . László Kovács camera gets in very close , his eye-lens peering provocatively as the strippers ' bodies move in various dance routines . This film made me feel like I was a paying customer . . that was how the director and his photographer often focus completely for long periods on the strippers and their routines . This will definitely be embraced by that crowd who adores trash and twisted premises like this film has . There's a soft-core sequence between the club owner that Lila works for and a potential client that seems to be in the film merely to satisfy an audience looking for a sex scene . I wouldn't call this a good film , but I certainly think it achieves what it sets out for . . giving a specific audience exactly what they crave . The abrupt ending leaves anything to be desired .
436031	9938570	397044	5.0	Blood and Chocolate	" We're all lost souls , Vivian . At least we're lost together . " Vivian ( Agnes Bruckner ) watched her family being slain as she fled to werewolf leader , Gabriel ( Olivier Martinez ) who offers sanctuary to all werewolves in native Bucharest , Romania where werewolves have their own church . Vivian has reached the age of 19 and in this built werewolf law titled " Gabriel's Law " , every seven years he takes a mate and has made it quite clear he desires her . Complications arise when Vivien falls in love with a visiting Graphic novelist , Aiden ( Hugh Dancy ) who has a particular fascination with wolves . Vivien doesn't enjoy the fact she's a werewolf , yet is told explicitly not to mingle with the humans for their secrecy is always in danger . Rafe ( Bryan Dick ) is Gabriel's son , and always a thorn in Vivian's side for he reminds her constantly of who she is despite her resistance to their laws and way of life . Rafe resists the rules his father has set , while masquerading as being loyal , like when he murders a chick that turned him down at a dance party . Rafe notices the blossoming romance between Vivien and Aiden and makes sure to turn squealer to papa obviously to ruin her happiness while being allowed the chance to kill , if necessary , someone who threatens their way of life . . even though he's done that himself in killing the human . Gabriel tells his son to warn Aiden to leave the city or else . So , the plot thickens . Will Vivien choose the one she truly loves ( Aiden ) , or follow the law and mate with Gabriel ? Better yet , is Aiden's life in jeopardy against a foe he couldn't imagine was more real than any drawing on paper ? Will Vivien resist her clan risking separation from the group she's always considered family ? I guess you could call this a werewolf love story . The " loup-garous " , as they are called , sparkle with light before instantly turning into these beautiful wolves . There is no massive morphing into some grotesque beast . Gabriel might seem on paper to be a sort-of villain , but I saw him as a leader looking out for his people because humans , in general , kill what they don't understand . Gabriel tries to explain this to a hot-headed Rafe who wishes to hunt and return , in a sense , to the primal beings they are . Gabriel tells him that they are not numbered in the millions anymore and the overwhelming majority of human hunters would render them extinct if they didn't remain in hiding . Rafe considers this fear when it's really simple logic . Vivien is this young blossoming woman who wishes for love with whoever she chooses , not what her supposed family sets up for her . This conflict is what drives the film . That and a certain tragedy that occurs when Rafe decides to violently confront Aiden when he doesn't respond too well to the warnings toward leaving . It's not a horror film as much as a difficult love story between two different people , one human , the other only masking herself as human trying desperately to deny the beast within . Still , Aiden becomes a hunted human for he represents the constant threat against the werewolves with his unfortunate fateful battle with Rafe only adding fuel to the fire . Vivien's occupation in the film is a cook in a chocolate shop , hence the part within the title . This is also actually how Aiden is able to find her once they separate after their first meeting .
436937	9938570	82948	5.0	Private Lessons	Silly , sleazy nonsense about foreigner Sylvia Kristel blackmailed into seducing a teenage Eric Brown by scumbag chauffeur Howard Hesseman . She will lead the horse to water , despite his ridiculous resistance at first , and then fake her own death with Hesseman tricking Brown into paying him off for disposing the body . But , Kristel falls in love with the gullible kid and decides to hatch a plot to turn the tables on the despicable chauffeur . Brown's father is away on " business " . Taboo-shattering , icky , squirm-inducing wet-dream fantasy might be more believable today as women ( . . and men ) seem to stay on the headlines for sleeping with underage teens . I watched a specific R-rated version which does show plenty of Kristel . . enough to make your mouth water anyway . She's quite sexy , but the whole plot with her falling for nerdy Brown is just too hard to swallow .
436184	9938570	50722	5.0	The Monster That Challenged the World	In the Saltan Sea of Southern California , giant prehistoric mollusks ( ! ) emerge from their centuries old tomb when an Earthquake cracks opens the wild rock formations which held them there . The monster's size derive from a Naval base's top secret Atomic experiments . Newly appointed Naval investigator , Lt Commander John Twillinger ( Tim Holt ) and the military will attempt to kill them as they use irrigation channels to travel , the mollusks threaten to drain the blood and water from any human being they come in contact with . In a method to stop such a thing from happening , the military attempt to close beaches and assign watches where the mollusks could surface . The key is to kill them before they multiply , or else the world could be in danger . Minor creature feature which doesn't really stand out amongst the vast series of sci-fi B movies that were in abundance during this period of time . The mollusks will induce giggles more than fright , and aren't very convincing . . but , for many , this will be entertaining , the monster design and movement part of it's charm . Holt's a serious , tough , rather bossy Naval investigator , who is actually a softy on the inside . . the kind of man-in-charge who expects proficiency and is always by-the-book . Audrey Dalton is Gail , Holt's love interest and woman-in-peril as she'll need rescuing at the end as a captured mollusk breaks free to terrorize her ( . . and Gail's little cutie pie daughter ) . Hans Conried is Naval scientist , Dr . Jess Rogers , the man in charge of the large desert base's laboratory . He's the one Twillinger turns to in discovering the facts regarding the mollusks . The film features unrealistic dummies representing human victims of the mollusks including one underwater military diver whose neck is caught in the creature's mouth . Another in a long line of films during this period focusing on the dangers of Atomic radiation , regarding testing and what it could mean to the welfare of our country and the world at large . Often develops minor characters who are to be sucked dry by the mollusks such as a young couple swimming and an assigned guard posted to watch guard over his portion of the irrigation canal . There's also a liberty to develop other characters effected by the duties of a Naval officer such as the pregnant wife of a scientist who is killed by the mollusk and we witness the blossoming of the relationship between widow , Gail and Twillinger who obviously takes a shine to her . Despite the hokey creature , I do , however , commend the filmmakers for at least building around it an ambitious screenplay ( . . the narration at the beginning is another familiar trait of these monsters movies which came out in the 50's , explaining the setting and the positions of the military who operate there ) . Despite the unusual creature itself , there's nothing particularly special about THE MONSTER THAT CHALLENGED THE WORLD ( . . including it's long-winded title ) , for it doesn't feature anything fans haven't really seen before , or better . And , killer snails are hardly the most scary kind of creatures to strike terror in the hearts of the viewers who watch such a movie .
436335	9938570	52901	5.0	Horrors of the Black Museum	The plot is deceptively simple . Michael Gough portrays murder novelist Edmond Bancroft who is obsessed with death and the act of killing in various methods especially . His devious acts of violence towards women is perhaps a hidden hatred for them . Perhaps researching murderers from the past , and his obsession with them , forged the way into his demented reasons to kill women . As explained to his hypnotized assistant Rick ( Graham Curnow ) , women were the main culprits in how murderers were caught and executed . Edmond lives and breathes the novels of killing he writes and he will do whatever it takes to make those works continue . So he uses poor Rick as a means to help perpetuate his literary bloodlust by often forcing him to kill or by helping him get rid of bodies he had murdered . Certain characters threaten Edmond's work so he makes plans to do away with them when their not expecting such as an antique store saleswoman for whom he buys merchandise from ( she plans to blackmail him after spotting her name on a pair of " spike-lensed " binoculars that stabbed a woman's eyeballs to the very nerves killing her ) or a doctor who , through both mental and physical examination , sees what Edmond is turning into ( . . or has already become ) . But , the most major threat is Rick's secret lady-love , Angela ( Shirley Anne Field ) . Horrors of the Black Museum has loads of potential , but seems to be devastingly marred by an abrupt ending . I myself felt like this film could've really been something great if we could've understood more about Rick's plight . Why does his face twist into this hideous sight ravaged by an ugly green tint . Sure towards the end we see him receive an injection by his master Edmond Bancroft , but really delving deeper seems to be this film's major flaw . It wants to make the evil Bancroft pay for his crimes rather quickly instead of furthering his abilities to lead detectives on a wild goose chase . He makes too many mistakes at the end which question his credibility to have gotten away with his twisted scheme for so long . I would suggest seeing it for several interesting death weaponry like the mini-guillotine or the aforementioned spiked-lensed binoculars , but Gough's delicious villainy is why I enjoyed it to a point . But , I also felt it needed a stronger ending than the blown-up finale which has Rick faced with the position of killing Angela when Edmond demands it . His descent through the " fun-fair " running around like a maniac is laughable ( still his face and how he turns is a mystery to me ) , and the reasons behind Edmond even going to the " fun-fair " is even more a mystery . And , why would Edmond abruptly try to have Angela killed so soon . . and SO PUBLIC ! Why not kill Angela like all the others . . in some sort of secluded execution . But , the film is colorful and has some fascinating moments . . just not enough for a great movie .
435773	9938570	100114	5.0	Marked for Death	" Screwface has two heads and four eyes , and that's the secret to his magic . " Lincoln Heights , a cushy suburb of Chicago , is being overrun by Jamaican drug-lord Screwface who is selling to the white youth on school grounds . Burned-out , retired DEA agent John Hatcher ( Steven Seagal ) gets in the middle of a blood feud with Screwface and his cronies when they threaten his family after he exposes them in a bar shootout with Colombians that goes awry . Teaming with old Vietnam war buddy Max ( Keith David ; now a football coach with a player and family exposed to the ills of Screwface's drug trade ) and a Jamaican cop Charles ( Tom Wright ) who has spent his career trying to take apart Screwface's drug trade , they will infiltrate the cartel with many dead bodies lying in the wake . The title of the movie represents a Voodoo curse placed on Hatcher and his family for he has corrupted their business with his involvement in putting a stop to them . About as dumb as these typical actioners come , it supplies fans of Seagal for what they ask for . . car chases , gun-fights , sword-fights , and snapped limbs . Seagal's hands are amazingly swift and he's able to mow over these Jamaican scum with ease . It doesn't stray far from the usual formula of a Steven Seagal picture . . it's all about the man taking out the trash in graphically violent ways . Many arms and legs are snapped like a twig and the villains are merely clichéd vermin to be eradicated like cockroaches . . Seagal is the quintessential exterminator . The lovely Joanna Pacula has a thankless role as an expert in Voodoo assisting love-interest Seagal with information about his nemesis ' religious practices . Basil Wallace is unintentionally hilarious as the over-the-top , spitting , bulging-eyed drug-lord . The Jamaican gangsters are presented as uneducated twats who can not pronounce a single sentence plainly .
436152	9938570	410650	5.0	Species III	Female , birthed from Henstridge's alien and the alien DNA infected astronaut from the previous film , is close to the most perfect hybrid whose eggs might lend an answer to how to cease the dying half-breed alien species . The half-alien / half-human species , created when the astronaut impregnated human women , have flaws in their DNA and succumb to illnesses and sickness due to their low immunity . Dr . Abbot ( Robert Knepper ) kidnaps " Sara " ( Sunny Mabrey ) , posing as a soldier in the military , before a half-breed could get her . Abbot is a professor who sees the Nobel Prize in the future if he finds the answer to the perfect half-breed species , devoid of the current flaws plaguing them now . He seeks assistance from a gifted student , Dean ( Robin Dunne ) , to help him in collecting data and perfecting their experiments on Sara . Meanwhile , Sara , who has grown to a young , luscious , sexual creature from an infant in a manner of days , seeks a mate , finding none that are worthy of her impregnation due to their sickness . Abbot and Dean always remain in danger as the lethal half-breeds continue their pursuit of Sara and a cure . As with most second sequels and beyond , the premise of the half-breed female sexpot aliens is wearing thin despite rampant nudity by stunningly gorgeous naked bodies . While some of the f / x are effective ( . . such as Henstridge's giving birth to infant Sara , subsequently strangled by a half-breed alien boy's tongue in the truck with her ; a man is split in half by an alien Sara's tongue ; some cool disease-riddled aliens in human form showing nasty flesh wounds developing ) , the budget has certainly dwindled somewhat when compared to the other films . . . such as when Sara murders the college dean which isn't the least bit convincing . Also , the story is smaller scale , removed from the governmental / national / global aspects which enriched the apocalyptic terror , instead taking place almost completely within a university town where college kids reside . . . sure , in dialogue that global terror exists , but in this film , the setting is confined in one significant area . Leads Dunne and Knepper are okay enough , and Mabrey is a babe . Yet , compared to Henstridge , who is almost irreplaceable as the incredibly sexy alien from the previous two installments , Mabrey is also smaller scale . As a sequel to an okay franchise , I have seen worse . And , we at least get to see the alien creature designs again , even if there few and far between .
435771	9938570	78916	5.0	Beyond the Darkness	Spoilers regarding some violent acts in the movie . . Read at your own risk . . " Death has no power to separate us . " Franc ( Kieran Canter ) succumbs to madness when his beloved wife Anna ( Cinzia Monreale ) dies of heart failure . What he doesn't know is that his house-servant Iris ( Franca Stoppi ) , someone who is was supposed to be able to trust , was the one responsible for her demise . . via witchcraft . Franc ( in a very explicit , gory sequence ) digs Anna's body from her grave , and preserves it removing the organs and blood . A female hitchhiker he was stuck with after fixing a flat tire ( she helped herself in the passenger's seat ) discovers what Franc is doing and tries to both flee and attack him in a state of fear and pays the ultimate price . Scratching his neck , Franc retaliates by plucking out her fingernails followed by death through suffocation . Iris finds Franc stuck in a difficult situation and assists him ! We find that Iris wishes to become his new wife and will help him get rid of the dead hitcher's corpse ( in another of many grisly scenes , Iris only too happily chops the body up dumping the pieces in a bathtub of acid ) . Another female victim is claimed later as Franc picks up a female jogger training for a race . You see Franc keeps his Anna's preserved corpse in their former bedroom and imagine the shock of a sexually willing jogger getting a glimpse of that as the man she's about to sleep with carries on without a flinch . Biting his hand , she receives a chunk of her throat pulled out by Franc's teeth as he devours the flesh ! Iris again steps in to assist him by burning the corpse in their incinerator in the basement . But , you have to question how long this union between to obvious wackos can last . A snooping man , who works for a priest in charge of keeping Anna's grave-site undamaged , begins to circulate around Franc's humble abode . . will he discover the truth ? Disgusting , unflinchingly gruesome tale lives up to it's reputation mightily . It'll take individuals with strong stomachs to watch it . The flick is directed seriously with no winking , but the twist at the end regarding Anna's surprise relative seems pulled out a hat . . it just seems a bit too much after seeing what we have for 85 minutes . As a gore film it succeeds . . but the flick is tasteless and especially morbidly sick . The flick's theme is about how obsession can cause people to do strange and bizarre things .
436302	9938570	479125	5.0	( Clive Barker's ) The Plague	A plague renders mostly 9 year old children catatonic , yet alive . Through ten years , they have serious seizures twice a day and mysteriously grow stronger . After this , anyone with child birth infants catatonic . . it brings about societal collapse and all across the world , laws are being enforced regarding pregnancy being outlawed and forbidden . Then one night , everything changes . These kids , now teenagers mostly , awaken inhumanely violent towards anyone who is in their path . While , thanks to news bulletins , this is a global catastrophe , the film centers in a town being overrun by these cold-blooded and unhinged kids who operate as a collective . What sent them into a coma for ten years and why are they so violent and powerful ? The film focuses on a selected group of characters . Tom Russell ( James Van Der Beek ) is recently paroled and returning to his hometown rather unwelcome . His older brother has a kid among the " catatonic collective " he has tended to for ten years . After meeting up with Sheriff Cal Stewart ( John P Connolly ) to show him his proper release forms , Tom finds his brother-in-law , Sam ( Brad Hunt ) drinking in an alley . Through Sam we find that Tom was responsible for the murder of someone in a bar-fight ruining a promising sports career and marriage to Jean ( Ivana Milicevic ) , a nurse who tends to a school of catatonics along with a staff . Jean's resistance isn't surprising but what Tom wakens to is . . his nephew attacking him after murdering his father . Along with Sam who has to assist him in dispatching their newly revived and bloodthirsty relative , Tom makes it for the school where Jean is working the late shift . With these catatonic kids now forming packs of murderous fiends , Tom , Sam , Jean , Cal ( . . his deputy and wife ) & a teenage couple , who pretend to be among the catatonic collective as a means of survival , hole up in a church as a temporary sanctuary . Sam's leg is snapped thanks to one of the powerful kids he attempts to fend off , and must rest while the others try and figure out how to evade the other killers for an Air Force Base miles ahead . The plan is disrupted when Cal's daughter is found in the church , with all hell breaking loose as a result . And , the collective are growing smarter , removing the innards of every vehicle and using guns . . For a good portion of the running time , " The Plague " operates like a zombie film . Characters who are able to escape from the clutches of the killing breed swarming around gather in a temporarily safe location until circumstances arise threatening the momentary peace . The killer kids attack with a ferocity , sometimes individually , oftentimes in groups . They pop up out of nowhere at times . A Steinbeck novel providing hope during harsh times ( " The Grapes of Wrath " regarding the Great Depression ) is used as a symbol for those in the film trying to hold their head up as the obstacles increase in number . The book is used as a device several times . The " collective angle " is important to the film as a whole . When one kids learns and adapts , the collective follow suit . The kids " devour " the souls of victims taking the emotions of each during the moment of removal . Perhaps this is why the collective continue their murderous rampage with seemingly no end . . taking what their victims feel at the time , there's turmoil , fear , and a desire to kill if necessary for survival . It seems they are searching for someone in particular . . this will ultimately come at the very end when Tom makes a revelation , provided through the last written words of a priest . The film also looks at the need for revenge with Jean serving as a major example when she reacts to the death of her brother in a most negative way . Clive Barker's name is on the film , but " The Plague " doesn't carry a single signature of his work , so do not be fooled . This film , despite some violent moments , is just too soft to even resemble a product of Barker's . . his name was just used as a marketing tool . The film , unlike many a zombie movie ( . . which this resembles even if it isn't directly a zombie picture ) , is played dead-serious with little-to-no humor . Carries a heady existential conclusion . Dee Wallace has a rather minor role as a grieving mother ( . . and wife to the sheriff ) who doesn't accept that her daughter isn't the little girl she once knew , with repercussions threatening our heroes .
436877	9938570	82700	5.0	Make The Die Slowly . . Cannibal ferox	Despite it's notoriety , I was so surprised that CANNIBAL FEROX was so positively dull . The film concerns a student of anthropology , Gloria ( Lorraine De Selle ) her research assistant brother , Rudy ( Danilo Mattei ) and gal pal ( . . with loose morals ) travel to the Amazon to prove that cannibalism doesn't exist . They encounter a vile , violent coke-addict diamond hunter , Mike Logan ( Giovanni Lombardo Radice ) and his poisoned friend , Joe ( Walter Lucchini ) soon discovering that they had attacked primitives in a nearby village , setting off horrifying circumstances . The premise is indeed a yawner as is Lenzi's unbearable pace as he relies heavily on the killing of animals ( . . villagers feasting on turtle and gator ; a tiger eating a monkey ; an anaconda smothering / squeezing the life out of a rat in it's massive tail as the poor creatures cries out for help ) and the Americans wondering / contemplating how they would be able to get out of their present situation intact . There's a lot of conversation , but the dialogue is painful to listen to . The approach is straight-forward yet stretches the action beyond what needs to be , letting the viewer sit impatiently on an alternate plot regarding a detective seeking out the whereabouts of Mike due to his involvement with drug dealers , including his girlfriend who may know where he is . I think the film could've trimmed the New York City scenes practically altogether , but alternating between the jungles of Amazon and the " civilization " of a big city does provide an interesting sub-text , but the heavy-handed message of who is actually the savage is rather loud and pretentious . Anyway , Gloria and Rudy are a sympathetic pair , but their decision to descend into the depths of a jungle without a guide is sheer lunacy . And , Pat ( Zora Kerova ) , the wild friend who accompanies them , makes a really bizarre decision to mess around with Mike , an obvious cretin from the get go . MAKE THEM DIE SLOWLY differs from CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST ( . . for which it's often compared ) in that , this time , you have people who aren't to blame for what happens to the villagers , yet in associating with scum like Mike , place themselves in great jeopardy . I will say that the film delivers in the grisly violence . A top of a victim's skull is chopped off , his brains eaten . . the same victim's pecker is hacked off and his testicles eaten ! A female victim is hung by hooks through her breasts as she slowly dies . One is hiding from the villagers , during an escape attempt , in a watery hole containing piranha which gnaw at his knee wound . A poor villager is bound as his eyeball is plucked out . A victim dies from a blood disease , he's disemboweled , his innards removed and eaten . A villager is shown eating slithery bugs . A villager is helping Gloria to escape and pays a great price when he sets off a spear trap that stabs him in the chest . Plenty of ultra-violence with Lenzi attempting to dethrone Deodato in sadistic grue . Radice is gleefully obscene and viciously ruthless in his treatment of the villagers which provides the viewer a chance to cheer for his execution . Radice's Mike Logan is a selfish sadist , coked up beyond the normal limits , and actually coerces Pat into leaving her friends without any supplies , to die . I'm pretty sure Lenzi directed this as a message movie , but that got lost within the blood-letting and unnecessary sub-plot involving the police's search for Mike .
436212	9938570	1060277	5.0	Cloverfield	A party given by Jason ( Mike Vogel ) to his brother , Rob ( Michael Stahl-David ) whose moving to Japan for a spell is interrupted when a rampaging monster wreaks havoc on New York City leaving absolute devastation in it's wake , while also " leaving behind " little creatures to terrorize citizens on foot . Through the use of a camcorder , operated by Rob's best friend Hudson ( TJ Miller ) , we are witness to the monster's attack and how the city appears once it leaves for other areas to destroy . Following the monster's attack on the bridge they're walking , Rob decides to return to find his beloved Beth ( Odette Yustman ) , who sends him a call claiming to have been hurt , with Marlena ( Lizzy Caplan ) , an unfortunate victim attending the party , Lily ( Jessica Lucas ) a dear friend set up the party , and Hud , taping everything he can . I think the most effective moments are when we witness the aftermath of the monster's rampage with a city crumbling with buildings and cars destroyed . The monster itself didn't really impress me , to tell you the truth , and perhaps should've been left to the imagination . The little creatures which seemed like off-spring from the monster were pretty creepy , especially when they attack our heroes in a subway tunnel . The bridge attack was a bit effective and the the smoke and terror on the faces of those who just witnessed their city attacked rather works . But , to tell you the truth , Spielberg's " War of the Worlds " was basically made in the same fashion , except for the " Blair Witch Project " type of " real footage found " governmental set-up . The city is attacked , we witness the carnage and horrified people , and follow certain protagonists as they try to move to a desired location . I agree with others that the camcorder used is top of the line and takes a licking and keeps on ticking . I do digress . . I don't think Hud would follow behind Rob , or Marlena , for that matter . Being best friends is one thing , but returning to find someone that's very possibly dead , Hud wouldn't be criticized if he joined those being evacuated . . . although , I realize we wouldn't have the " Cloverfield experience " if that was the case . You can read on this site the numerous factual errors that are looked over in impacting the viewer like Beth's damaged building leaning against another skyscraper or the Statue of Liberty's head . As far as the constant dizzying movement , it didn't bother as much as others , but there were times where I wanted him to hold the damn thing still . . I guess we must understand the situation Hud was facing and take it from there .
436936	9938570	120841	5.0	Species II	Patrick Ross ( Justin Lizard ) was the very first man to step foot on Mars . But , in one of the planetary samples , a specific fungus carrying the alien race from the first SPECIES film thaws out on board the American space shuttle and invade the body of Patrick and astronaut Anne Sampas ( Myriam Cyr ) . For some strange reason , Dennis Gamble ( Mykelti Williamson ) wasn't invaded by the alien . Later testing might prove that being a sickle cell anemia carrier might've saved him . This also might be a key to killing them because it's proved through experimental testing by Dr . Laura Baker ( Marg Helgenberger ) on clone half-human / half-alien Eve ( the VERY , VERY sexy Natasha Henstridge ) that the breed are able to regenerate cells . When women are being found mutilated soon the government will be on the lookout for Patrick , who has been having sex with various females ( hookers , lovers , admirers , etc ) and impregnating them with half-human / half-alien children who burst from the stomach not too long after mating occurs . When these children reach a certain stage in numerous days , they will turn into a cocoon and once released will be fully grown to terrorize and conquer the human race . Colonel Carter Burgess , Jr ( George Dzundza ) is the military muscle behind pushing the experimental project for finding a way to kill the alien species and when he discovers that another is on earth ( . . after the murder of a scientist who discovers alien genes in Patrick's blood ) , he calls in Press Lennox ( Michael Madsen ) , the kind of special ops man / bounty hunter with a skill for finding prey he target . He's the man the government call in to do their dirty work . He'll team with Dennis who sees for himself , when Patrick blows his head off with a shotgun ( . . with it subsequently regenerating before his very eyes ) , what the alien is . Laura , who has bonded with Eve during their period of time together ( . . while it's Laura's job to find a way to kill Eve , it's really her agenda to protect her from harm ) , will also have to team with press to stop what could be a global disaster from taking place . Patrick must be stopped and the storage place of the cocooning aliens must be found before it's too late . The most prominent threat . . if Patrick and Eve mate an even more advanced alien being might emerge perhaps too unstoppable for anyone to handle . The cast doesn't have a lot to do except quote their lines and the film is rather derivative of other similar sci-fi films using threatening aliens , but I found it decently entertaining in a race-against-time sort of way . I wanted more Henstridge , here used more as a sympathetic being , and the pace is so fast plot can not catch up . . but , I'm one in the minority who doesn't believe this is the worst sequel ever . It was just not as well developed , screenplay-wise . It does feel rushed , but has some gruesome alien-attack sequences such as the aliens protruding from the bellies of their human mother hosts . It's forgettable , but could be looked at as a flick to watch when you got time to kill .
435698	9938570	54462	6.0	The Wasp Woman	A scientist has discovered a way to reverse the aging process through experimenting with the extracted enzymes from wasps , but there's a nasty side-effect . . those who take injections of the serum slowly " become " a wasp over time , which includes attacking those the person ( . . or thing ) comes in contact with for their blood , devouring the prey . The lovely Susan Cabot stars as Janice Starling , the head of a cosmetics marketing company , Starling Enterprises , that is slowly losing their customers due to her aging ( . . she is also the company's model spokesperson ) . Janice discovers that a scientist , rather rejected as a kook by his own medical community , Eric Zinthrop ( Michael Mark ) , may've found a way to reverse aging and she provides the financial means for his research and experiments . Shown the success of his work on animals , Janice opts vocally to serve as Zinthrop's human guinea pig . After the experience of her beauty and youth returning , Janice becomes obsessed with the process working faster , entering Zinthrop's office while he's away . After an auto accident where a vehicle hit Zinthrop while crossing the street , Janice continues to inject herself , and even worse , her scientist has suffered a possible brain injury . While comatose , Janice begins turning into a human wasp attacking certain employees who have the misfortune of coming in contact with her , at night . She reverts back to her human form , but the changes are becoming more frequent and it's only a matter of time before she threatens nearly her entire staff , including Bill Lane ( Anthony Eisley ) and Mary Dennison ( Barboura Morris ) , members of her marketing team who begin to search for missing colleagues such as the cosmetic chemist , Arthur Cooper ( William Roerick ) and the building's night watchman ( Bruno VeSota ) . One of director Roger Corman's notoriously cheap creature features with star Susan Cabot first wearing old age make-up , soon donning a silly wasp mask and insect gloves . Look , I fight myself when I watch these movies because on one hand , this is 1960 and many young filmmakers had to deal with the budget they had , attempting to make the best movie according to the funds available . I like these mad scientist movies that deal with the " fountain of youth " formula and Corman's film hones in on the obsessions with beauty and how that drives ambition to return to the thriving success you once had , that has waned due to age . And , it's as prevalent today ( . . if not more so ) as it was in 1960 . I think Corman makes the correct decision showing less of the wasp woman as possible , to restrain the giggles of many audience members who wouldn't consider such insect wardrobe realistic . I really liked Cabot , and thought she expressed all the anxieties of losing her beauty , the rejuvenated spirit of gaining it back , and the pressures of keeping it ( . . while struggling with the creature yearning to escape and the secret of having to hide bodies from her employees ) rather well . It doesn't hurt that she's not bad to look at ( . . and , the old age make-up did little to fool us into thinking she wasn't a sight for sore eyes , because her impressive figure was still intact ) and I felt Cabot was able to draw sympathy from the viewer due to the harsh climate of a powerful woman in a business world where beauty is held to such a high degree . But , it receives a high level of criticism due to it's poor costume for Cabot . . during the time of it's release , I'm sure it probably made hearts flutter from those in attendance . If I were to hold this movie at such severity , I'd have to pick on THE FLY as well , because both films deal with actors in costume . . I haven't seen the remake of THE WASP WOMAN , but the story is fine and could benefit from some more effective ( . . elaborate ) effects . That , for me , was really the only negative holding THE WASP WOMAN back . I feel the low IMDb score is unfair , but many have contempt for these kinds of movies so THE WASP WOMAN lingers with a 3 rating .

Morlant is dying and has his aide , Laing ( Ernest Thesiger , up to his usual scene-stealing ways ) bandage the jewel in his hand . Unfortunately for Morlant , Laing steals the jewel in a moment of weakness and before long others seek after it such as Dragore , sneaky no-good accountant Broughton ( Cedric Hardwicke ) , and even " padre " Nigel Hartley ( Ralph Richardson ) . Betty Harlon ( Dorothy Hyston ) and Ralph Morlant ( Anthony Bushell ) are cousins from bickering families related to Professor Morlant who stood to benefit from anything left by him after his death . What no one counted on was Professor Morlant's " rising from the grave " in search of the stolen jewel . . he plans to bow at the altar of his pagan statue hoping for eternal life with the jewel clasped in his hand . While being deliciously atmospheric with foggy nights and creepy Morlant estate as the setting , this film lumbers along at too slow a pace . Kathleen Harrison is the comic relief as Kaney , Betty's friend who tags along , falling for Dragore and getting into possible peril when the jewel winds up in her hands out of all people . The leads , Hyson and Bushell aren't charismatic or charming enough , but pros Karloff ( . . the precious few minutes we have him ) , Hardwicke , Thesiger , & especially Richardson give this some merit . Not really that bad , but could've been so much better .
436262	9938570	70603	6.0	Curse of the Devil	Irineus Daninsky ( Paul Naschy ) and his men , crusading in the name of God , execute a group of Satanists and his ancestry are cursed by E Bathory as she is burned alive . The movie continues many years later as a descendant , Waldemar , kills a wolf which was actually a male member of gypsies who call upon the Devil ( a man dressed in a black suit and gloves . . quite a surreal sequence in a cave ) to have sex in a cavernous worshiping lair swearing to torment him with a curse . A pretty one from their group seduces Waldemar later sprinkling some of her " infected " blood on the skull of a wolf's head pressing a nasty bite into his flesh . He is now to become a werewolf at the Full Moon always to terrorize innocents biting and slashing . A vicious ax-killer is also on the loose chopping up pretty ladies and beheads the satanic woman who accursed Waldemar with werewolf blood . The ax killer will also do battle with Waldemar in werewolf form . A family from Budapest set roots in a cottage nearby Waldemar . Waldemar falls in love with the older daughter of the Wilowa family who informs him she's pregnant with his child . Her jealous younger sister seduces Waldemar . . at the wrong time , a night of the Full Moon , and becomes another in a growing line of werewolf victims . Soon many villagers ( . . and a traveling troupe camping nearby Waldemar's estate ) are getting their throats slashed and faces ripped to shreds . By the end of the film , most of the film's cast are destroyed by Waldemar , in werewolf form . Not too bad , I thought , as far as the series goes . Mixes the occult within the werewolf sub-genre for some interesting results . I think it would work a lot better if given a better soundtrack , in Spanish language with subtitles ( truly terrible dubbing where it seems that those who spoke the dialogue had contempt for the material making this flick cheesy when it could be an more serious werewolf product ) , and had snappier pacing . But , this delivers on the gore . . lots of bloody gaping throat wounds and facial tears . The werewolf even slams a huge stone across a victim's face ! Also has a grisly scene towards the end as villagers decide to form a lynch-mob killing Waldemar's hired help and comrade with farm equipment . Beautiful location assists , especially at night where my favorite sequences seem to take place . Chock full of nude female flesh as well . Not as good as " Werewolf Shadow " , but not the worst werewolf film I've seen .
436100	9938570	245120	6.0	The Forsaken	Prolific director JS Cardone ( Alien Hunter ; Shadowzone ; Outside Ozona ) brings us this profane Midwestern vampire tale with attitude starring Kerr Smith as , Sean , a young editor of trailers for a low-budget movie company who takes a car delivery job from Cali to Florida , but his journey is disrupted when he unfortunately picks up a hitchhiker , Nick ( Brendan Fehr ) who just so happens to hunt bloodsuckers . The head vampire , Kit ( Johnathon Schaech ) he's looking for is of a specific number called " The Forsaken " , a clan who accepted an offering from a demon and hence were cursed to only walk the earth at night . Sean and Nick come across a young woman , Megan ( Izabella Miko ) who has been bitten by Kit and is slowly going through the process of " turning " as the vampire who left the virus in her continues to live . While trying to cool her body ( . . Nick , who has been bitten and must also find a member of " The Forsaken " before he himself becomes one of the undead , notifies Sean that Megan's blood is " burning " so her body temperature must be cooled ) Megan bites Sean's hand leaving Kit's virus in him . So now Kit's death is of major importance because not only does Megan suffer as long as he remains alive , but Sean also is threatened to become a vampire . Nick , appropriately enough , encountered a doctor who had been bitten and was given knowledge of certain drugs which can slow down the process of turning into a vampire . But , the drugs can only last so long so finding Kit and exterminating the source of the blood disease is of utmost importance . But , Kit as his own brood , two female bloodsuckers and a dim-witted subservient day-driver ( Simon Rex ) , who travel with him so Sean and Nick , with Megan used as bait , will need to find holy ground for a legitimate stand-off . Ina Hamm ( Carrie Snodgress , rather wasted ) just so happens to live in the middle of nowhere with her house stands on top of a Spanish graveyard . . perhaps this is indeed the refuge they need as a base to fight Kit . The film doesn't pretend to be anything else but a horror tale of innocents plunged into a battle against a predator who holds the keys to their salvation . It's too bad this was made in 2001 because Cardone's trashy little vampire film would make perfect drive-in fodder . Schaech's presence as a charismatic and sexy male vampire really adds a great deal to this particular film as does Phina Oruche as his black sex slave Cym who attacks bloody throats with ferocity . Rex will earn chuckles as a rather simple-minded human watcher often saying " Okeydokey " when ordered by his boss to commit murderous deeds to those who threaten them . Particularly memorable is the murder of a cop who pulls Rex's Pen over for speeding , insists on seeing what was in their truck , receiving a shot-gun blast to the chest , and subsequently is burned alive on top of the hood of his police car . The attractive cast is headlined by Smith as the young hot-shot stud with a big bright future in the movie industry whose life is changed by a fateful drive into a most dangerous situation , and Izabella Miko as the doe-eyed innocent whose family was obliterated by the evil clan and bitten by Kit who must settle " unfinished business " when one of his vampire chicks didn't follow his command of killing her . Fehr was a bit too young , I felt , for the part of vampire hunter who knows an awful lot about the history of this breed of bloodsuckers . . I often wondered just how he received all this information . But , I guess Cardone was perhaps motivated by the studio to fill his cast with beautiful people so Fehr was selected . The opening of Cardone's film sure sets the tone of this flick , a zombie-like Miko showering the blood from her gorgeous naked body . She's later undressed by Nick attempting to find the vampire bite as Megan lies comatose from the virus raging inside her . Miko is either asleep or mute for a good portion of the film but Cardone utilizes her vulnerability , youth , and beauty quite well . . very photogenic . There's a very nifty image of Miko's Megan with her hands pressed up against the back window of Sean's car as they drive away from a scene which nearly killed them . This film isn't all that original and seems to evoke the spirit of " Near Dark " , but I thought Cardone uses the setting at night really well and there's a nasty streak this film has that worked for me . There are some unnecessary images propelled into the action from past scenarios which distracted me a bit , but certain gory bits are effective like how vampire bodies explode when in contact with sunlight too long , and a shot-gun blast to the face which does some serious damage . " The Forsaken " would probably make an appropriate double feature with John Carpenter's " Vampires . "
435668	9938570	50294	6.0	The Deadly Mantis	A volcanic eruption near the Antarctic circle causes an after-effect which triggers the release of a gigantic Prehistoric praying mantis , enclosed in ice centuries ago , in the Arctic circle . An outpost ( Weather Shack ) of a " dew line " radar system set up around the North Pole , is the first of many attacks by the flesh-eating insect ( . . with an insatiable appetite ) which can leap , fly , and walk making it a dangerous and deadly threat to human civilization . A C-47 plane and an Eskimo village become other targets before Colonel Parkman ( Craig Stevens ) , authority over a radar Interceptor base for the Dew Line ( Red Eagel 1 , " Sentinel of the Arctic " ) built as a distant early warning system to cease sneak attacks by other hostile countries , and Dr . Nedrick Jackson , curator of the Department of Paleontology of the Museum of Natural History and chief scientist in his field , are called to stop the monster before it poses an even deadlier threat to the United States during it's suggested path of a more tropic climate of South America . General Ford ( Donald Randolph ) of the Pentagon hopes they can stop it as the praying mantis sets it's sights on Washington . The closing of the film is the mantis ' attacks on Washington before a showdown in the Manhattan tunnel between it against Parkman and his men . While the low IMDb rating of 3 . 3 perplexes me , I'm guessing that a modern audience will find it hard to accept the monster for this movie . It's not as realistic as the Harryhausen creations , but if you are a die-hard fan of these types of creature features , then " The Deadly Mantis " will provide a decent amount of entertainment . I thought the dialogue was literate and intelligent . . those who wrote the script weren't numskulls . The flick has a serious tone and is handled very matter-of-fact , and I think this can only help considering the hokey monster created on screen . You might call " The Deadly Mantis " a " second-tier " creature feature , as it doesn't have the qualities of much better sci-fi / horror " giant insect " outings such as " Them " or " Tarantula . " Still , I think the cast is fine in their roles , enhancing the dialogue , bringing a bit of respectability to this B-movie item . I've seen a hell of a lot worse movies than this and , at the very least , the film uses stock footage well , juxtaposing it within the film rather seamlessly . Only major problem I had was that no insect , no matter how huge , could sustain the attacks of bullet-fire , missiles , and a flamethrower , not to mention the mini-mines used in the tunnel at the end . My favorite scene was the climax in the tunnel as the men try to stop the mantis as it emerges from the smoke . The special effects are a detriment that are awfully hard to overcome , specifically in the age of CGI . Alix Talton is Marge , a magazine photographer working with Jackson and the military , and a love-interest of Col . Parkman .
436754	9938570	96142	6.0	Sorority Babes in the Slimeball Bowl-O-Rama	Biker / thief Spider ( Linnea Quigley , punked out , but still a babe ) , vulgar and disgruntled most of the film , has to reluctantly join forces with nerdy Calvin ( Andras Jones ) to outsmart a demon imp released from his bowling trophy prison ( ! ) who is turning college kids into ghouls and victims . It all starts when three dweebs , the aforementioned Calvin ( drunken thanks to his dorky dorm pals ) , porky Jimmie ( Hal Havins of " Night of the Demons " fame , as obnoxious as ever ) , and Keith ( John Stuart Wildman . . I have a bone to pick with this particular nerd , more on this joker in a moment ) caught peeping on two sorority hopefuls , Taffy ( Brinke Stevens , at her most delicious ) and Lisa ( Michelle Bauer . . at the height of her sexual powers ; but shamefully underused ) naked in the bathroom , getting cleaned up after their paddlings and whipped creaming . Babs Peterson ( Robin Stille ) is the head sister who , along with her pledge sisters Rhonda ( Kathi O'Brecht ) and Frankie ( Carla Baron ) , force the girls hoping to join their sorority , and the geeks caught sneaking a peek , to steal a trophy from her father's bowling alley . Once inside , the gang release the imp accidentally unleashing carnage on them all . While Babs and her posse plan to spoil their victims ' evenings , they have no idea what's ultimately in store for them . Before this unfortunate mistake , the group find Spider trying to break open an arcade game for the cash inside . Seduced by the imp's supposed good will at granting each individual a wish a piece , those who take up his seemingly good offer find themselves doomed . But , the imp uses it's powers to hold the group hostage inside with a type of electronic forcefield and can invade bodies with possession . Based on this silly premise , you must acknowledge that this film is completely tongue-in-cheek the entire way through . Anyone who ventures into a film titled , " Sorority Babes in the Slimeball Bowl-O-Rama " ought to know what they are getting themselves into . Director David DeCoteau seems to be using natural light within the bowling alley because it's often hard to see what has happened to various victims . This film , like many a sex comedy / horror comedy trots out the clichéd characters , dumb girls naked and naive , nerds who , once confronted with the possibility of sex , freeze , sorority gals who like to mistreat their " inferior " subjects , and hogger practical joker who annoys everyone around him . It's all in good fun if you approach this film in the right frame of mind . Often the one-liners , many from Quigley , do fall flat , but there's enough true gags to keep one entertained . . particularly those looking for a cheap laugh or two . I couldn't stop laughing a near-deaf Janitor Buck Flower , who for the first twenty or so minutes is locked in an equipment room , and later has a HILARIOUS conversation with Quigley regarding the imp and their terror within the bowling alley . . . misunderstanding what another is saying often works so well , especially when it's Buck Flower . But , even Buck , as funny as he is , can not top Brinke Stevens bathing soap from her naked flesh during her shower or Michelle Bauer hot and bothered ready to rave Keith . Oh , and on Keith . . one thing that has always driven me bonkers about movies with nerds are those where they have this sexual dynamo , in lingerie no less , on top and ready to molest them , as they squirm trying to retreat ! And , this guy has Bauer on top and wishes to get away from her . . NUTS ! Anyway , the film has Buck , a puppet demon with the voice of a bluesman , and two major-league honeys . . what more can a guy ask for ? ! Oh , and to top it all off , you have one of the sorority girls turned into the Bride of Frankenstein ( . . the scene as she chases Quigley with an axe and surprises Buck with a knock at his door . . not to mention his reaction . . are gold ) running around loose ! What's not to love , right ?
436110	9938570	475289	6.0	Hack !	A class trip to an island turns into a nightmare as the college students hoping for a high grade to boost their GPA fall prey to their hosts , a married couple , obsessed film buffs , who record those they murder in ways associated with horror movies . This , at first , appears to be just another formula slasher . You have a check list of stereotypes that normally appear in slashers and can pretty much mark an X by the characters who will die as the film continues . But , what sets it apart from the fray of the usual is the wicked sense of humor , expert casting of genre veterans , and some perverse acts by a bizarre couple of psychos . But , also important is that HACK ! actually plays against norm in that a guy actually is the one at the end fleeing from killers . And , a specific twist regarding a third ( . . and possibly fourth ) party perhaps involved with the psychotic duo certainly adds to the terror for our hero , Jay Kenneth Johnson ( . . as the hunk Johnny ) as he must find a way out a very sticky situation as his friends are dead and his options of escape are limited . Danica McKellar ( . . the cutie from Wonder Years ) is " nerded " up as the unflappable , scholarly Emily , but we all know that a pair of glasses and braided hair can not mask the babe underneath the disguise . Emily is google-eyed for Johnny , who , in a change of pace for a slasher film , actually takes up for her when fellow classmates poke fun at her supposed dorky nature . . yet , Johnny is still able to gain rapport with his fellow students because he's just a cool dude . The rest of cast are merely supplying cultural stereotypes bound for violent death . . a dumb , impolite jock quarterback needing a high grade to make his football team , a sexpot , a foul-mouthed , weed-smoking skank , an Asian homosexual whose sexual orientation is the butt of many jokes and gags , and the token black character who supplies the pot , talks ghetto and is always trying to dial up someone on his cellphone that doesn't work ( . . imagine that ) . Most of these characters service the film as victims running through the island woods as the predators give chase . There's a dungeon the loonies have , a chamber of horrors where destroyed victims , grisly corpses , are used as set-pieces for memorable images in movies like Hellraiser & Texas Chainsaw Massacre , and one captured character is held in a large bird cage over a piranha-infested water hole ! Surprising number of recognizable faces pop up in minor parts such as Kane Hodder ( . . as the opening victim trying to escape from his pursuers ) , Burt Young ( . . as a crusty boat captain who takes the crew to the island ) , Tony Burton ( . . as nervous Sheriff Stoker , who worries that something dire has happened to the kids when they don't return ; he has a scene with ROCKY co-star Burt Young which might bring a grin to fans ' faces ) , William Forsythe ( . . as a gruff Irish island fisherman who attempts to save the day , and has some memorable exchanges with the psychos ) , and Lochlyn Munro ( . . as Burton's moronic deputy ) . Lots of in-jokes such as the names of the crazies , Vincent King ( Sean Kanan , whose chiseled features and clean-cut looks adds a unique dimension to his nutcase ) and Mary Shelley ( Juliet Landau ; who's always obviously a bit weird , her camera by her side at all times ready to record even the most mundane occurrences for a " new movie " ) . Even the professor , who is to chaperon the students , is named Mr . Argento ( . . nice ! ) . There also an abundance of references to horror classics and iconic characters popping up in the dialogue . This is made by filmmakers who love the genre and try to express that in as many ways as possible . The violence derives from an ax , hand gun ( . . rarely a weapon used in horror ) shot gun ( . . makes a real bloody mess of a victim's skull ) , thrown loose brick , a well ( . . the homage to The Grudge is quite an eye-opener ) , clown's hammer ( ! ) , chainsaw , and a spinning saw blade ( . . decapitating a bound person's leg as he screams in horror ) . A thrown saw blade decapitates a victim whose leaning up against a tree . Lots of gore and viscera . Gabrielle Richens as Sylvia , a foreign exchange student lusting for the quarterback , is quite a looker . Once McKellar is able to shed her geeky disguise . . yummy . Slasher fans might embrace this one . . it's dark heart is in the right place .
436750	9938570	106449	6.0	John Carpenter Presents Body Bags	John Carpenter , as a dead man masquerading as a coroner , presents three gruesome tales from a morgue , provided with ample ammo of ghoulish zingers and sight gags . The first tale is , in my opinion , the weakest , but has many recognizable faces which add in-jokes for horror buffs to salivate over . A young woman , Anne ( Alex Datcher ) starts a gas station job and runs into trouble throughout her first night . Loose prowling Haddonfield ( hahaha ) a serial killer , who has been murdering women , might just pay Anne a visit . Anne has a sealed outpost where she remains locked in with no common way for anyone to enter unless she allows them to , yet she finds herself making trips outside when she shouldn't be . Wes Craven provides a cameo as a creepy customer , Robert Carradine ( Louis of REVENGE OF THE NERDS fame ) has an important role as a supposed gas station employee who assists Anne before she gets started , Carpenter alum Peter Jason has a amusing cameo as a lively customer , Buck Flower as . . guess what ? . . a suspicious looking bum , David Naughton ( American Werewolf in London ) as a friendly customer who forgets his credit card and might just be in the right place at the right time when Anne needs him the most , and Sam Raimi , providing a facial sight gag and . . cough . . corpse that gives this rather average slasher story an entertaining twist . The idea is that Anne is safe as long as she remains in her locked quarters and that we know that a killer is on the loose . Carpenter then plays with the concept of Anne leaving the safety of her confines , in essence toying with the viewer on when the expected confrontation will take place . The second tale is a dandy at getting under the skin ( . . hahaha , pun intended ) . Stacy Keach is perfect as a man constantly haunted by his thinning hair-line who enlists the aid of a hair-growth company through chair-man David Warner and nurse Deborah Harry who convince him to take their treatment . What Keach's Richard doesn't expect is what the long locks which sprout from his open bandages derive from . This is particularly creepy when we find out what the hairs are and where they come from . Special make-up effects master Greg Nicotero has an amusing cameo ( . . just because of his own long hair ) , & Sheena Easton ( . . yes , the singer ) is Richard's tenderhearted , but burdened girlfriend Megan who wishes he'd quit suffering about his hair-issues . The third tale is a grisly affair using " Hands of Orlac " as inspiration . Baseball player Brent Matthews ( Mark Hamill ) on the verge of escaping the minor leagues , has a serious car wreck which destroys his left eye . Through a delicate eye surgery , Dr Lang ( portrayed by horror classics vet John Agar ) restores the sight to Brent , but for a price . The new eye , from a dead psychopath who died in the gas chamber , provides unpleasant memories and killing methods Brent soon discovers . Brent becomes affected by the cruel images he sees , and the safety of pregnant wife Cathy ( Twiggy ) might be in danger . Lots of eye-violence in this particular tale . Roger Corman has a cameo as a physician who reluctantly offers Dr . Lang's assistance to Brent . Tom Arnold and Tobe Hooper pop up as the real coroners at the end with some business to take care of . . which might just have something to do with our host . Carpenter directed the first two tales himself and Tobe Hooper helmed the third . " The Eye " was my favorite , but " Hair " is probably the most original while " The Gas Station " is the most derivative . Yet , " The Gas Station " provides plenty of moments that brought a grin to my face .
436949	9938570	75917	7.0	Dead of Night	The late great Dan Curtis brings us three horror / fantasy tales from the pen of Richard Matheson , featuring a strong cast . Made for television , Curtis was one of the most successful producer-directors working in the field of horror during the 70's . A nice double feature this would make with his superior omnibus , Trilogy of Terror ( . . starring the incomparable Karen Black ) . The first tale ( Second Chance ) stars Ed Begley Jr as Frank , a young man with a knack for restoring older cars , with a knowledge and love for them . He restores a ' 26 London Playboy , understanding from it's past that a teenage couple perished as the driver attempted to pass a train . Driving the Playboy down a dirt road , Frank finds himself in the nearby town Crestwell , except in the 1920's ! This is a poignant tale resembling those time-warp Twilight Zone nostalgia episodes where an otherworldly journey back in time can alter the lives of others , a chance given back due to the particular care of someone towards a machine left buried under a tarp . The second tale ( No Such Thing as a Vampire ) features Patrick Macnee as a professor whose wife ( Christina Hart ) seems to be falling prey to a vampire , under his own nose , asking a colleague ( . . played by Horst Buchholz ) to assist him . Elijah Cook Jr . is Macnee's frightened , superstitious butler . This one has a twist regarding adultery and revenge . And , the third , final , and best tale ( Bobby ) stars Joan Hackett as a deeply traumatized mother who desperately longs for her deceased son , who mysteriously drowned ( Lee Montgomery ; BURNT OFFERINGS ) , going as far as using black magic , attempting to conjure him back from the dead . He does return , but it isn't the son she once knew . This one is stylishly executed and suspenseful as Hacket finds herself fighting for survival with Montgomery chasing her throughout their large house ( . . overlooking a cliff leading to rocks and ocean below ) , playing a game of hide-and-seek trying to kill her , as the thunder roars , power out , and the childlike voice proclaiming , " I'm gonna find you , MOMMY ! " Montgomery has this really boyishly innocent face that makes his character's emerging menace even more palpable . The twist , regarding who this kid really is , adds a nice sock to the senses closing the anthology nicely . The first two tales aren't very potent in the terror category as the opening narration would suggest , but the third tale takes up the slack of both of them , and then some . Interesting enough , DEAD OF NIGHT is quite similar to TRILOGY OF TERROR , structurally , in how the tales impact you . . the first is a mild opener , the second has an eye-opening twist , and the third packs a wallop ( . . quite a roller coaster thrill-ride where a heroine attempts to escape an unlikely malevolent presence bent on inflicting harm , brought to life by a magic spell ) . I think this will entertain fans of classic horror anthologies , but isn't quite as successful or memorable as TRILOGY OF TERROR , mainly because the novelty of starring Karen Black ( . . who displayed her incredible range as an actress ) isn't here . The first film better belongs in a TWILIGHT ZONE anthology movie than in a Dan Curtis production . I found it pleasant , written with heart and care ( . . one can see Matheson's yearning for days gone by ; this one felt particularly Bradbury ) , but not suited for what was supposed to be a " terror trilogy . " The second's draw is Macnee and Cook Jr , even if the result of the tale is only mildly effective . . although , Macnee's wicked grin leaves an unsettling feeling , closing the tale . I think most viewers will leave this movie , impressed with the final tale to the point that the overall product will have legs for years to come .
436047	9938570	63170	7.0	Snake Woman's Curse	The first 45 minutes or so of director Nobuo Nakagawa's " Snake Woman's Curse " displays the tragic circumstances of a small family's hardships under the tyrannical power of cruel landlord , his equally nasty wife Masae , and their wicked son , " young master " Takeo . A sickly elderly farmer , Yasuke , desperately wishes to pay of his debt for a small portion of land , and later dies after futilely attempting to persuade the landowner to give him more time . Yasuke's gentle wife and daughter , Sue and Asa , are left without a place to live , and are forced into hard labor under the ferocious iron hand of Masae , who immediately responds towards them with aggression and menace . Even the smallest mistake or miscue , and the women are dealt with the harshest punishment allowed . Takeo takes a shine to Asa , raping her multiple times , without any sense of regret or guilt over such actions . Even worse , Takeo knew of Asa's desire to marry local farmer , Sutematsu , and took her virginity so that they couldn't marry under the proper terms . It doesn't get any better for Asa , because her dear , innocent mother , Sue , dies when the landlord strikes her during an attempt to stop her master from killing a snake she was trying to save . Facing continual cruelty from Masae and not being able to see a possible bright future with Sutematsu , Asa will take her own life . Sutematsu , enraged , will seek revenge against Takeo , fated to end up such like the kind peasant family he loved so dear . The later portion of the film shows the Ônuma family falling prey to the ghosts of the three they wronged . The apparitions of Yasuke , Sue & Asa often appear to the Ônuma trio as a reminder of their roles in their tragic deaths . The symbolic theme throughout is the appearance of snakes and hallucinations of scales showing up on people's bodies , a method used to torment the Ônumas . The ghosts appear out of the blue , snakes popping up in bowls , out of the air , crawling throughout the rooms . . the Ônumas are now the subject of cruelty , attempting to rid themselves of the ghosts that haunt them and unable to do so . Are the ghosts really there or are the Ônumas merely falling prey to their own demons , their own guilt ? Takeo is tormented by the memory of Asa , her pleading against his sexual abuse ringing in his mind . The landlord tormented by Yasuke's begging to keep his property , even promising to eat dirt if necessary . Masae constantly plagued by the images of snakes , her actions towards Sue ( . . who always wished to protect snakes when others wished to kill them ) returning to terrorize her mental state . The film is quite black and white . The Ônumas are vile , unsympathetic monsters , who work their hired help day and night . Always barking and commanding , often never at ease with those who doggedly seek their approval . Yasuke's family , quiet , meek , soft-hearted , and hard-working . They just wish to work for their land and earn their keep . Their plight at the hands of the Ônumas is undeserved and ruthless . The film presents the ghosts in white face paint , a light introducing them to us and the Ônumas who are besieged by them . The score is eerily effective presenting a disorienting nature to the scenes where the ghosts appear to the Ônumas . The film presents the hierarchy as unlikable cretins who deserve the terror released upon them at the end , while the peasant workers slave , sweat , and work their fingers to the bone without much support / appreciation from those that rule over them . Director Nobuo Nakagawa's film isn't subtle ( . . neither was his more famous work , Hell ( Jigoku ) ) and loudly proclaims it's disdain for the mistreatment of the poor by the rich so many might be critical ( . . as they were with Jigoku ) of such a one-sided presentation . The good lower class trampled under the cruel boot of the evil wealthy , a theme that is preached from the pulpit of Nobuo Nakagawa without restraint . . sure to turn off a few who would rather the director paint a more complex portrait . I didn't mind the theatricality of it all and rooted my heart out for the bastards of this film getting their just desserts .
435877	9938570	23649	7.0	Vampyr	Journeyman Allan Grey , a morbid fellow , with special interests in the occult such as devil worship and vampirism , finds himself in a place eerily similar in tone to the supernaturally evil subjects he studies . . a creepy inn nearby a castle housing a family haunted by a vampire and a sinister doctor who could be doing it's bidding . While , the film does indeed have a story , master director Dreyer is clearly more interested in building an atmosphere with weird goings-on where shadows live and breathe and our gloomy hero becomes a part of a plot by a vampire to take over an innocent family using a doctor and his accomplice as slaves for it's bidding . The film contains shadows dancing , a man's shadow moving on it's own , Allan's " out-of-body " spirit witnessing the doctor and his accomplice closing a casket containing his body ( . . with Dreyer shooting Allan within the coffin , through Allan's eyes looking out the coffin window , and Allan's dead face from behind the coffin glass ; each image is quite spooky and effective ) , the Lord of the Manor , whose home Allan finds himself , shot by a shadowy figure's rifle , a skeletal hand with a bottle of poison appearing in Allan's dream among other sequences providing the viewer with lots to remember . I thought it was a bit slow-moving and methodical , certainly a product of cinema just releasing as sound was being introduced on the outskirts of silent film . An odd collection of characters with very interesting faces . Dreyer's camera moves as methodically as his film's pace . Certainly an interesting companion with something like Murnau's Nosferatu which would make an ideal double feature . Great dissolve from corpse face to skull after a vampire is staked through the heart . Ideal location for filming such a Gothic horror tale with the low-quality transfer actually surprisingly enhancing the experience , for me at least . Thankfully , I watched this on Turner Classics in about as pristine a form as I could ever expect . Really , the film feels and looks like a silent picture and really doesn't need any sound at all . All you'd need are title cards and music and it'd be an ideal silent film . Seems to feature heavily religious undertones where the power of evil can overtake the good unless instructions are followed properly through the use of a guide provided to Allan by the Lord of the Manor , who left orders for the " vampire book " to be read after his death .
436290	9938570	56606	7.0	Tower of London	Roger Corman directs his vision of the William Shakespeare story about the humpbacked evil conniving brother Richard III to dying King of England Edward IV with a unique spin . Vincent Price ( quite animated ) plays the mad Richard to the hilt with theatricality ( I could also use the description , hammy , but he's still a joy to watch ) as he murders those who stand in his way to the throne . Whether it's to whip and stretch the limbs of Mistress Shore ( Sandra Knight ) , merely a handmaiden to the young princes of the throne , the suffocation of dead Edward's young sons , the accidental choking of his wife believing she was the ghost of Shore , placing a hungry rat in a head cage holding the Earl of Buckingham ( Bruce Gordon ) , or stabbing his brother in the back . . we see in Corman's surprisingly violent way ( . . hardly holding back . . we see Richard , and his right-hand man , smother the children in the Tower as one drops a puppet ) . But , the difference Corman brings to the story is the ghosts who haunt Richard's guilty conscience . Most of the story's layout remains . He will gain his crown , but run into a battle unprepared against an enemy whose smarter and more levelheaded since it's clear Richard should've never been King to start with . He gains the crown , but doesn't have the brains or know-how to fight a battle against a superior enemy . I loved the angle Corman adds to the story regarding the ghosts haunting Richard as it adds a flavor to the picture . . a ghoulish , entertaining element played with such macabre relish by a director with grand style in spite of limited budget and means . And , Corman's camera-work is stunning . However , I do feel purists will be turned off by this version of Corman's towards the story by Shakespeare . . the dialogue is dumbed down to where it can be easily digestible .
436609	9938570	68370	7.0	Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things	For the first hour this plays like a warped comedy , as it regards a theatrical troupe whose ego maniacal , " carrying a few screws loose " leader Alan Ormsby , ruling over them with an iron fist ordering his employees around holding up their acting jobs as collateral for they are to resurrect the undead on this island graveyard off the shore of a big city ( New York ? ) using witchcraft . Unbeknownst to them , it works and the final 20 or so minutes cashes the check you zombie fans were waiting to receive . Boy , the closing of the film as the zombies unearth from their tombs ratchets up the terror considerably . I don't know if it's the low-budget photography , the unsettling sound effects , or grungy make-up effects ( not to mention , the choice of skin tone color . . sure seems to increase the foreboding quite a bit ) that makes the final half-hour so intense and disturbing . It could be Clark's in-your-face style or that feeling of helplessness as the characters run out of options as the zombies close in . I think this would make an interesting combo with Fulci's ' Zombie 2 ' . The first of Bob Clark's 70's Horror Trilogy . Not everyone's cuppa tea ( MANY hate the characters / cast of the film ) , but I'm a fan of this flick .
436900	9938570	69994	7.0	Don't Look into the Basement	Nurse Charlotte Beale ( the lovely Rosie Holotik ) has arrived to Dr . Stephens ' clinic for the insane prepared for a new job . What she doesn't expect is to find another supposed doctor in his position after Stephens is attacked by axe-wielding maniacal " judge " Oliver W Cameron ( . . in a running gag , anytime he confronts a situation out of his control , he retreats to repeating his name ) . That doctor is Geraldine Masters ( Annabelle Weenick ) who isn't sure about whether Beale is a proper fit for their establishment . After a long discussion about the position ( which is quite an awkward scene as the two debate about Beale's being sent a letter by Stephens getting a job at the clinic with Masters often reminding her that he is no longer in charge ) Masters agrees to let her work in the nursing position , but the good Doctor may not be who she seems . . The assortment of loonies includes Sam ( Bill McGee ) a simple-minded child-man who was Stephens ' last victim of lobotomy , Jennifer ( Harryette Warren ) a woman who needs an adult to comfort her as she wallows at Masters ' heel like a puppy , Danny ( Jessie Kirby ) a trouble-making annoyance often trying to steal the fake baby of disturbed Harriet ( Camilla Carr ) , Allyson ( Betty Chandler ) a sexy nympho who just wants to be loved and hops at any man she sees , & " Sergeant " Jaffee ( Hugh Feagin ) your typical case of soldier who hasn't escaped the madness of war . The film shows Masters ' unorthodox methods of running the clinic with allowing the patients to roam free with the doors to all rooms without locks calling into question . . and , not to mention , the fact that Oliver is still allowed to walk around despite just chopping Dr . Stephens with an axe . And , what exactly happened to Dr . Stephens ? Ah ha . . Tacky 70's drive-in trash is a lot of fun if you are into a warped brand of cinema . I'm attracted to bizarre flicks about mental rejects because of their unpredictable nature . . you just never know what the hell might happen , especially in this case where they are allowed to roam often unattended . Some consider the low budget a liability , but in the case of this film , I think it enhances the experience . With the cheap photography and weak production values ( being shot for peanuts in a run down house in some awful location ) it seems creepier and I felt like a voyeur peering into insanity through a camera lens on the outside looking in .
436278	9938570	67592	7.0	Succubus	Tourists and their bus driver must stay overnight at a château because of travel complications . What they don't know is that a succubus plans to prey on their innermost desires ( each character preyed upon represents one of the seven deadly sins . . an intriguing ingredient in the film's success ) taking their souls from them , leaving the mark of Satan as they perish . The succubus ' main desire is the conquest of a man studying to be a priest . . if she can win his soul , a man of God , then her goal is a successful one . The succubus is played by the evocative Erika Blanc who only shows her true face ( one quite hideous truly representing her evil ) when she is about to vanquish her victims . Amonst the victims is the bus driver who likes to gorge on food , a wealthy woman who desires the supposed gold of the château's Baron von Rhoneberg ( Jean Servais ) , a crusty old curmudgeon who thinks he knows it all and never ceases to insult others , etc . There's no doubt that this film unfortunately suffers from a shoe-string budget , but director Jean Brismée really has a creepy château to provide an eerie sense of dread as each character walks unknowingly unto certain doom . Erika's " ugly make-up " representing her true face is quite creepy and the actress succeeds in her role as this soldier for Satan who relishes taking souls from those who harbor lusts of this world . The ultimate question is will the " future " Priest be able to survive the advances of the succubus , or fall prey to lascivious wanton fleshly desire ?
436263	9938570	65677	7.0	Forbidden Photos of a Lady Above Suspicion	Pill-popping , alcoholic wife of a struggling businessman , Minou ( the foxy bright red head Dagmar Lassander , often covered with heavy facial make-up ) is being tormented by a sexual deviant / sadist ( Simón Andreu ) who has her listen to a cassette tape that might just possibly link her husband the killer of an investor who was recently found dead . Minou adores her husband and even if he's a killer she's willing to give up her body to this cretin if it saves her beloved from being implicated in a crime of his own doing . What Minou doesn't realize is that the blackmailing sicko photographed their sexual activity and now threatens to expose pictures to her husband if she doesn't allow herself to becoming his sex slave ! The blackmailer is quite elusive and any trace of his identity seems hard to come by . . Minou's husband Peter ( Pier Paolo Capponi ) and Police Commissioner Frank ( Osvaldo Genazzani ) believe it's quite possible she's having a nervous breakdown or a collapse in sanity . Only her nympomaniacal best friend Dominique ( the VERY sexy Susan Scott who is wardrobed to show the goods and figure she's blessed with ) seems to believe Minou's cries that there is a sadistic fiend threatening to kill her if she doesn't comply with his demands at sexual servitude . But , is the blackmailer REALLY the mastermind of the degrees of mental anguish bestowed upon Minou ? Crazy giallo has a few twists and turns , but this is a psycho-thriller where we know the heroine is voicing the truth although he's cagey and able to hide away from capture . The film puts out everyone as a suspect , even Dominque at one point . As in the very best gialli , the success of the plot depends on how the viewer is fooled . . if you can see the twist coming a mile away ( . . and I did ) then perhaps it fails . As far as the fashions . . this is a gay fashion designer's wet dream . The film's a practical run-way of Italian fashion dressing Lassander and Scott in various styles . Plenty of sleaze for the average giallo-lover .
436018	9938570	32245	7.0	Before I Hang	A scientist devoted to solving the process of aging is convicted of a " mercy killing " and due to hang , granted permission to continue his experiments with colleague Dr . Ralph Howard ( Edward Van Sloan , of Dracula fame ) in a prison laboratory until his sentence is to be carried out . After developing a serum , and with only a few hours left before facing his hanging , Dr . John Garth ( Bortis Karloff ) decides to inoculate himself with the use of blood deriving from an executed murderer , with tragic results . Granted a reprieve by the governor with his sentence reduced to life-in-prison , Garth finds that he's actually getting younger , but the blood from the murderer used in the serum which was inoculated in his veins contaminates him with an uncontrollable urge to kill which places innocents in danger . In fact , Garth strangles Howard before a thief enters the lab , with a scuffle killing the man . Garth is considered an innocent harmed in that scuffle when in fact he was the man behind both deaths . Released a free man , his old friends he wishes to inoculate become targets thanks to the inner desire to kill , one by one victims of handkerchief stranglings . Garth will hope to pass on knowledge to his daughter's fiancé Paul ( Bruce Bennett ) before turning himself in to the proper authorities . But , will he be able to do this before the urge to kill actually threatens the life of daughter Martha ( Evelyn Keyes ) ? Meanwhile , the police suspect Garth might be behind the stranglings and investigate accordingly . Nice little 60 minute B-movie programmer with a fine performance from Karloff as the tragic victim of corrupted blood , an experiment gone awry . Many will find similarities to many films he was making at the time , playing scientists who meant well , falling prey to unforeseen circumstances regarding unusual experiments often rejected by the medical community at large . The " victim of science " theme isn't fresh by today's standards considering so many films have been made since this film concerning scientists / doctors and their attempts to advance the medical field / life through unorthodox means . I think Karloff's sympathetic performance reels in the viewer and the film is nicely produced adhering to the typically blessed Columbia Pictures studio system where even low-budget offerings carried a polished look and style ( . . see " Cry of the Werewolf " for further proof ) . Karloff was always adept at portraying characters far older than he was and this ability is used here where he starts out as a man perhaps 60 or so , looking younger as the film continues . You expect nothing less than excellent when Karloff headlines your movie . I relish the fact that there many of these less heralded films in Karloff's resume still left for me to discover . So often we back his career into a corner where he's known for his Universal and Val Lewton films , when there's a plethora of little underrated titles ready for the viewing public .
436689	9938570	62865	7.0	Day of the Evil Gun	Not bad little western starring Glenn Ford as Lorne Warfield , a gunfighter who has had his belly-full of killing and just wishes to carve out a new life with his wife and two daughters . When he finds they have been kidnapped by Apaches , Warfield will have quite a few obstacles in his path before he can rescue them . Arthur Kennedy has the best role of the film as Owen Forbes , a man in love with Warfield's wife and resents the man for walking out on his family . Forbes is slowly growing accustomed to killing as many will die by his gun along the way . Warfield is always looking over his shoulder in regards to Forbes but will have to form a partnership with him in order to somehow survive an accompaniment of ordeals along the way such as Army deserters wishing to make a trade with those Apaches who have kidnapped Warfield's family . They'll have to contend with Mexicans , also . The film is excellently photographed by cinematographer W Wallace Kelley , especially many numerous long shots which really open wide the hot desert landscape Warfield must ride ( . . and walk ) along the way . But Kelley's marvelous camera-work during the Apache attack on the small town filled with betrayed Army deserters led by John Anderson's Jefferson Addis , is wonderful to behold . Probably my favorite sequence is when Warfield and Forbes have been tied up to be meat for the buzzards as we watch and wonder in horror how they'll ever escape this ordeal . When you have Glenn Ford and Arthur Kennedy as your leads , a film would be hard to dislike . This one does have a rather routine plot , but as I mention above the cast and photography is first-rate .
436703	9938570	107076	7.0	Hunting season . . is over .	Emil Fouchon ( Lance Henriksen ) and Pik van Cleef ( Arnold Vosloo ) have a very lucrative business that pays in dividends . . and cost men their lives . They give their bored wealthy clients prey to hunt down and kill in this umpteenth variation of The Most Dangerous Game . It's rife with poetic violence thanks to director John Woo's always flashy style , but don't look for some sort of deep , thought-provoking experience because this is the type of genre film bent on showing bodies being shot to kingdom come and lots of slow-motion gunplay with explosions galore . That stuntman for Van Damme is quite amazing although the wig he's saddled with isn't too convincing . Van Damme portrays Chance Bourdreaux , a man who gets involved when assisting Yancy Butler's Natasha Binder . . a woman searching for whoever murdered her father . It all leads to Emil's business and how he likes to use those somewhat skilled ( . . and desperate ) in how to survive often finding war vets and the like . What Emil never counted on was a real challenge in Chance who seems indestructible and flat-out hard to kill . Soon , Chance and Natasha are on the lam . Wilford Brimley portrays Uncle Bouvee , a dear ally to Chance and knows how to shoot an arrow from his bow with a marksman's skill . This film has lots of of what you expect from an actioner from a director known for setting up amazing sequences of bullet-infested violence , but there's little real time in this for character development . Seems most of the attention was devoted to how Van Damme could kick a guy while shooting him at the same time , or how to find various ways to shoot a person . Then there's the awesome sequence where Henriksen is really on fire when he removes his coat . . THAT was stunning and I personally commend the actor for staying in that moment even as it was life-threatening . Fun , in a brainless sort of way , but doesn't hold up next to Woo's masterworks with Chow Yun Fat , HARD TARGET is merely an ant stomped under foot against HARD BOILED or THE KILLER . Henriksen and Vosloo are great as the heavies , though .
435881	9938570	100586	7.0	Shadowzone	Surprisingly effective little sci-fi horror flick produced by Charles Band's Full Moon Pictures . Experiments funded by the military has a staggering side-effect when the head scientist , Dr . Van Fleet ( James Hong ) discovers that an alternate universe exists when a subject is induced into a vast , deep sleep . . something sinister lies on the other side and uses the subject as a portal into our world . Everyone within the underground facility are in danger as the being which has found it's way into our dimension is hostile towards those it / they consider a threat . Captain Hickock ( David Beecroft ) is investigating the mysterious death of a test subject in the underground facility and we can see that the scientists involved with the EDS ( Extreme Dream Sleep ) are hiding something . Sensing this , Hickock wishes to see the printout results on the corpse and to settle doubts that his death wasn't a result of the sleep experiment . . unconvinced of the results , and unpersuaded that Van Fleet's claims of a genetic cerebral hemorrhage as the cause are correct , he wishes to see if another current subject would suffer the exact fate if the sleep levels were the same . In doing this procedure , the current subject is induced into sleep too long and the being from the other universe is able to use him as a gateway into our plain . This puts everyone in peril for the being has the amazing power to shift it's molecular structure and can imitate anything lifted from the thoughts of humans . It travels throughout the facility and must be caught and killed or else . . once it attacks Van Fleet who had locked himself in the sleep lab with the being , we realize that it is not exactly friendly . Really neat B-movie cast includes Louise Fletcher as a rather odd scientist ( Dr . Erhardt ) who finds the being spellbinding , and seems to have been cut off from society a bit too long , and Miguel A . Núñez Jr . as computer specialist / electronics genius Wiley . If you have seen Miguel A . Núñez Jr . in other films , you can just about expect his fate . David Beecroft is your typical hero , an outsider unaccustomed to the way things are in an underground facility isolated from the world he belongs . Through Hickock , Beecroft is a no-nonsense , take-charge kind of character who is realistic and practical when faced with a really difficult situation , which he certainly inherits when searching for the truth regarding the death of a civilian . Frederick Flynn is the tobacco-chewing , easily rattled handyman , Tommy Shivers , who could use a shave , bath , and some manners . He's also really bad at his job , and we see how poorly managed and worse-for-wear the facility is as Hickock inspects the place . . pipes often spit steam , water leaks are apparent , and rats are visible in the kitchen area . Affected by earthquakes and hampered by such a small staff , the facility sure could use a make-over . The being itself is a series of monsters , not particularly as scary now due to the advancement in special effects ( . . or as effective as say Bottin's work in THE THING or Stan Winston's work in PUMPKINHEAD ) , but effectively grotesque when they pop up on characters . . the monkey creature is quite a ghastly creation . I have read about SHADOWZONE's comparison to ALIEN , but the only similarity I noticed was the plot regarding characters roaming the halls and rooms of the facility as the being is somewhere in the vicinity . . some attempting to put food together for the long haul with Hickock & Wiley attempting to repair the damaged transformer after the mishap regarding the being's entry into our universe . Shawn Weatherly is scientist Dr . Kidwell , who is so attached to her pet monkey ( . . a supposed lab animal no longer needed when Van Fleet began to test human subjects ) she'll risk her life to find it when it goes missing . . the twist regarding her finding a monkey is a doozy . Not as gory or violent as it could've been , probably due to lack of budget ( . . for a Band production , the film looks great , particularly the underground facility and it's devastated state due to natural and unnatural factors ) , but director JS Cardone is able to build the dread quite nicely due to the fact that the being could be anywhere and mimic certain things ( . . this was perhaps what many believe was ripped from THE THING , I guess , because an animal is used by the being to trick characters ) . Maureen Flaherty and Robbie Rives are the nude test subjects shown frequently in all their glory . Lu Leonard has a funny role as the rather grumpy cook dealing with a rat problem Shivers won't correct due to his procrastination . Hong is entertaining in an all-too-short role as a nervously cautious scientist worried that Hickock might make a discovery that halts the funding of his experiments . The film does feature some questionable decisions by characters who seem to leap before thinking things thru .
436239	9938570	410537	7.0	The Ghost	An amnesiac , Ji-won ( Ha-Neul Kim , playing the character as vacant and lost as possible ) troubled by a traumatic past which is slowly unraveling memories , begins to realize that a ghost , possibly of a high school girl , Su-in ( Sang-mi Nam ) is killing former friends who ridiculed this girl because of her low-income status . What Ji-won doesn't realize is that her " past self " was a nasty rich bitch who treated those less fortunate , from a financial standpoint , like dirt while her " rat pack " would join in on the festivities of name calling among other cruelties . Along with her boyfriend , Ji-won will indeed seek out the truth behind the deaths of her former friends and who is behind them . Soon , the complete mystery tucked away in her subconscious , will reveal a horrifying drowning that perhaps shapes what has been taking place to her former school chums . Each of Ji-won's high school friends die by drowning shortly after the ghost appears to them in a vulnerable state unable to find help from their menacing visitor . As you've read throughout the user comment section already , " The Ghost " is stylishly directed and rather well acted . The film looks great and the cast doesn't disappoint . There are even a few scares here and there . . but it's all rather familiar . The twist at the end saves this film , I believe , from completely feeling " been there done that . " It's a mind-boggling doozy of an ending , I'll tell you , where someone isn't who they appear to be . . it's the case of " identity crisis " where jealousy can drive the motivations of a cast-away so longing to have the life of the one they envy . It's the kind of twist that takes you right back through what you just have seen , putting a new light on the story and central character . The film is designed like " The Grudge " as a spook film , so there isn't any graphic violence , the emphasis is on creeping the audience , not blood-letting . The ghost , as can probably be pictured in the minds of those who have seen numerous Asian horror flicks , is a girl with long black hair which splits to reveal this discolored eyeball that peers at a potential victim . When her hands reach out , and her feet walk across the floor , water is shown soaking off , foretelling to the viewer this restless spirit's fate . I felt the director skillfully crafts the story , supplying the memories of a past conveying to us just the kind of loathsome person Ji-won was , and how Si-un was treated by her . This back-story is supplemented as the story comes to the obvious confrontation between Ji-won and the ghost . I think one can rightfully criticize how similar this film feels to others that have came before it , but at least we get a back story into their lives and what motivates the horrors to those who kept a specific secret one fateful day .
436939	9938570	371257	7.0	Stay	A psychiatrist , Sam ( Ewan McGregor ) , tries desperately to keep a patient of his , Henry ( Ryan Gosling ) from committing suicide when he turns 21 . Yet , as Sam continues his mission to try and keep Henry from making that grim decision , reality around him becomes distorted and surreal . People who are supposed to be dead are indeed alive , not to mention many vanish and reappear , or change roles according to either Sam or Henry . For instance , Sam encounters Henry's supposedly dead mother who , in turn , believes he is her son . Henry's mother's dog viciously bites Sam's arm , yet Henry informs him that Olive ( the dog's name ) has been dead for many years . A young woman named Athena ( Elizabeth Reaser ) is one minute some waitress Henry grew attached to , yet the next she's his fiancé . All this occurs as Sam pursues Henry's whereabouts as the young man often returns to him for comfort . Then there's Lila ( Naomi Watts ) , Sam's lover & a painter , who had attempted suicide before , but even she may not be who she seems ( her face often distorts with Athena's creating this whole other weird vibe ) . Even Leon ( Bob Hoskins ) , Sam's blind friend , is claimed by Henry to be his dead father . There's even a scene where Henry and Sam are talking at the same time , saying the same thing . The ultimate image that reflects back to us over and over is a car crash on the Brooklyn Bridge which might be the true answer to all the madness occurring to Sam and Henry . Universally panned by many ( . . and seemed to go through theaters faster than an eye-blink ) , I think it's quite underrated and should be given a chance by fresh eyes . Everything bizarre and unusual that happens on screen can really get frustrating ( like seeing certain faces playing duel characters ) , but if one can hang on until the very end everything gets it's just explanation . The film is certainly mind-bendingly trippy , and Forster's camera is always shaking things up where we can not settle into a comfort zone . I liked it and thought it's puppetering twists from strange scene to strange scene as we follow not only Sam's wild journey for truth , but seeing Henry's abilities to change those around him ( such as giving sight to Leon ) can be a lot of fun . It's a given , though , that many are just not gonna except it on it's own terms and will shut the film off half way saying to hell with it .
436781	9938570	107209	7.0	Faraway , So Close !	Cassiel ( Otto Sandler ) decides to follow Damiel's path and become human , but realizes that this world differs greatly from where he came from . His supposed " nemesis " is a shady character named Emit Flesti ( Willem Dafoe playing him very oddly ) who can communicate through both worlds . . he talks with Cassiel's " angel partner " Raphaela ( Nastassja Kinski ) and can also chat away with mortals . He seems to have this particular interest in time and time seems to be very prevalent in how Cassiel views this brand new world . The world to Cassiel can be a curious beast . . he starts out as any new babe in a brand new world by slowly adjusting to his surroundings . He visits several mortals he viewed as an angel in the other existence taking what little he knew from them incorporating everything into his new man . . Karl Engel . As Karl , he has a hard time making headway in the mortal world , at one point deep in an alcoholic daze , but meets a corrupt businessman who changes him into a whole different person . Money begins to slowly corrupt Karl who is entering a world of crime with his boss that may ruin his goal set when he even decided to come to our world . . to try and bring humanity to a cold and sad world . That seems to be Flesti's desire ( as he often tells Raphaela who often begs him to let Karl alone ) for Cassiel . . that his Karl descend in this mortal world finding out that he doesn't belong here and should return to his angel duties . This film is quite a contrast to " Wings of Desire " for which it's a sequel . While Damiel's entrance to our mortal realm was indeed because of love for his beloved Marion ( the lovely Solveig Dommartin ) for whom he often shadowed , Cassiel's decision came because he wanted to make a difference . . bring joy to a disheartened world . But , corruption , greed , and other vices may put a damper on those plans . The film , through Wenders direction , lovingly meanders with the German and American languages often mixed together as characters speak . There's less of a melancholic tone to this one where " WoD " was centered in a location of West Berlin before the wall came down and many's hopes and dreams seemed nil . Like in the first film , the camera offers a POV shot of how Cassiel flies , and there's the drifting between B & W and Color to show the changing of worlds for which the angels and mortals inhibit .
436416	9938570	383574	7.0	The Scarecrow reviews " Dead Man's Chest "	If you have seen the previews and understand that this is labeled under swashbuckling FANTASY , then you probably do not need to complain at the film's lack of logic . . because there really isn't any . If you seen a Davey Jones pirate who appears to look like he's a crossbreed with a squid , then you ought to know what you are going to see . The film is perfect summer blockbuster material . It revels in it's silliness and ridiculous stunts and bows it's giggling head to all those movies that play with believability throwing caution to the wind . The film's nonsensical storyline consists of three different factions after the heart of pirate ghoul Davey Jones which is locked away in a chest and he holds the key . Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley must get the compass which guides the way to the chest because certain governmental baddies desire that heart for it would mean the seas would be owned by East Mining company . The power of the seas is Davey Jones due to a love pact with it . Captain Jack Sparrow also desires to have the heart because if anything the open seas should be rules by a pirate . Sparrow has a map of the key and the compass . . how he retrieved either one is a mystery ( he recovered it from a dead corpse's casket ; at the beginning of the film we see he hid in the casket blowing a hole out of it after getting the map . . I do not know how he came upon the news of where the compass or the map would be . . we must accept what we get or not } . So Bloom must get Sparrow to give him the compass or else . Soon Sparrow meets up with Bloom's father who leaves a mark on Sparrow's hand declaring him ill fitted for certain doom . Soo Davey Jones desires to catch Sparrow for he desires Sparrow's soul . It goes on and on , but the film is about the dead man's chest and how everyone needs the heart inside . The film has an abundance of stunt sequences which defy everything beyond any form of logic . The sequence where Bloom must save Sparrow from being burned and eaten because his crew is captured by a tribe who think Sparrow is a god , shows this oval cage of bones and skulls which has encased them and their adventure down hills is extremely ridiculous . Not to mention , the dueling on top of a wheel towards the end . There's this octopus creature which consumes ships { an amazing scene where this thing engulfs a ship and it's crew is astonishing } called a Kragon and the grotesque masking of Davey Jones ' crew for who are all amphibious are highlights in good computer graphics . Overlong , overblown , but never boring .
436842	9938570	473514	7.0	Mulberry St	A day / night in the lives of an eclectic group of characters , who live in a crumbling apartment complex soon to be possibly condemned on Mulberry St , are focused on as a societal collapse is imminent , threatening NYC due to a crisis of infection from wide-spread rodent bites . Manhattan soon is overrun by infected citizens who are slowly transforming into human rodents ! Once the citizens are completely infected by the rat virus , they attack anyone in their path , longing to feast on their flesh . Characters like Clutch ( Nick Damici ) , a former boxer seen often jogging on the streets ( also the one his fellow neighbors in the Mulberry St apartment put their trust in ) , his daughter Casey ( Kim Blair ) , recently returning from a tour in Iraq carrying a facial scar she's self-conscious about , Kay ( Bo Corre ) , a Polish-American single mother who works at a local pub nearby , are just a few the film isolates as the outbreak takes shape . While the influences of Night of the Living Dead ( characters trapped in an apartment complex as infected humans await them outside ) and 28 Days Later . . ( the " giddy-up " rat-humans , shaky cam style and running humans trying to escape as the predators pursue them ) are undeniable , I still found " Mulberry St . " a pulse-pounding thrill-ride . The rat-humans are shot quite the same way as the " rage-infected " human zombies of 28 Days Later ( & 28 Weeks Later ) . . the camera doesn't really completely eyeball them , because they move so fast , in such a frenzied state like wild animals starving for supper , that we don't exactly identify with them . And , once they are on the rampage , our regular working-class heroes are often on the move , or trying to find shelter or weapons to protect themselves . Appropriately grim with a rather downbeat climax as governmental biological teams finally arrive after night closes , with many of the cast members either dead or turned . The shaky-cam will undoubtedly turn some people off ( . . or turn their stomachs ) , but it gives the film an immediacy that I felt keeps the viewer on edge . I can see why director Mickle opted for the shaky-cam technique . . it does give the film a documentarian closeness with those characters focused on . There are shots within the apartment which give " Mulberry St " a claustrophobic dread while outside , there's too much space ( . . and often a deadening silence on desolate streets with rat-humans eating silently , always listening for sounds of fresh meat ) as bodies lie all over the place . Larry Fessenden has a funny cameo as a running civilian who locks the gate on a fellow citizen , later suffering the consequences when he himself needs help . I think " Mulberry St " is a rare film in that the characters , and the actors portraying them , are multi-dimensional .
436453	9938570	71628	7.0	House of Whipcord	Naive , young , gentle-hearted , beautiful French model , Ann-Marie Di Verney ( Penny Irving ) is drawn to a dark and mysterious " writer " , Mark E Desade ( Robert Tayman ) after meeting him at a party , later ( . . after a date ) agreeing to meet his mother outside of London , despite knowing little about him . Ann-Marie's pal and roommate , Julia ( Ann Michelle ) doesn't like the idea of leaving with a man she has just met and these worries come to fruition when Mark takes her to an abandoned institution which works as a cover for a hostile prison for " immoral girls not fit for society who must be punished into submission " . Mark's mother , Mrs Wakehurst ( Barbara Markham ) was once a prison governess who lost her job after her aggressive torturous methods towards a French inmate ended in death . The elderly , blind Justice Bailey ( Patrick Barr ) , whose mind is slipping into senility , once holding a prominent position , is now operating as the secret prison judge , having left his wife for Wakehurst after getting her off for her previous misdeeds regarding the murder of the girl ( . . the penalty being the loss of her license , and the source of her deep rooted , and thriving bitterness and hatred for " loose women " ) . Their marriage has worsened substantially over the years , and we discover that Mark is their illegitimate son ( . . there are also disturbing incestual undertones eluded to later on ) Forced against her will into an illegal imprisonment , Ann-Marie notices other girls that have met these particular circumstances as well . . it seems Mark's job is to lure women to this place so that they can be tried and convicted in some sort of bogus sentencing , a ceremony so ridiculous ( . . Wakehurst must now inform of her husband of the lines he's supposed to say due to his forgetfulness ) it borders on parody . You can only imagine how shocking and surreal such a situation can be . Told not to speak unless spoken to , given very little to eat , and a penalty system for bad behavior ( # 1 : Solitary confinement , # 2 : A flogging , & # 3 : Death by hanging ) , Ann-Marie will have to figure out some way to escape or else face the dire consequences of her current predicament . Working with fellow prisoners who have had enough of their cruel mistreatment at the hands of Wakehurst and her unpleasant guards , Walker ( Sheila Keith ) and Bates ( Dorothy Gordon ) , Ann-Marie will attempt to break free from the harsh confinements of such a bleak and unfriendly environment . Meanwhile , Julia confides in her lover , Tony ( Ray Brooks ) regarding Ann-Marie's whereabouts setting out to find her if she can , attempting to discover just who Mark is and his location . Appropriately grim women-in-prison film throwing a young lamb into a den of wolves . Barbara Markham is quite impressive as the diabolical ( . . with homicidal tendencies and a yearning to see the pretty deteriorate ) warden who hides behind this cloak of morality , wielding her power as if chosen by God to reform those deemed unfit to exist , when in reality she enjoys making girls suffer . The unbridled sadism , buried underneath this cold and calculating execution by the warden and her staff , really has you pitying poor Ann-Marie , who really is a sweet-hearted teenage girl who isn't ashamed of her body . Penny Irving positively glows in the opening scenes , a very vulnerable , somewhat bubbly girl whose modeling career is seen as a blight on society ( . . Walker obviously wishes to , along with writer David McGillivray , create a film exposing authoritarian types who use their power and code of ethics as a tool to discriminate , as the hypocrites they are ) by certain people who really wish to punish and harm because of the thrills that such methods provides . Sheila Keith is particularly memorable as Walker , an obvious lesbian who harbours a lust for Ann-Marie , but hates her at the same time for the type she represents . Through facial movements and specific gestures , Sheila Keith is also able to show her attraction to Ann-Marie , but , at the same time , we see the conflicting repulsion that soon overcomes her . It's a very convincing performance that can elicit chills . The film doesn't actually dwell too much on the whip flogging , although Walker establishes the potency of it's use very well showing whelps and bruises on those victimized . There's a certain hopelessness that permeates throughout Walker's film for Ann-Marie as she is constantly on the verge of escape only to be ensnared right back into the snake pit by unforeseen circumstances . Thanks to cinematographer Peter Jessop's lighting and the miserable aura of the institution setting , Wakehurst's prison is quite a morose and unforgiving place and you can do nothing but feel for those trapped within it's cells . Walker really wishes to keep the indelible image of the hangman's noose in our minds , knowing that this method of execution has been used ( . . we witness a prisoner sentenced to hanging for attempting to steal a piece of bread , and the failed operation to sneak her away from the death chamber ) before and could be Ann-Marie's fate if Wakehurst has anything to say about it . Walker alternates between Ann-Marie's plight and Julia in London growing more concerned about her friend's condition and reasons for not communicating somehow . It's a form of manipulation , of course , allowing the framework to advance regarding Julia being Ann-Marie's only hope ( . . another form of manipulation is Walker establishing Ann-Marie's potential getaway thanks to a truck driver nearby the Wakehurst estate ) . Stanley Myers score exceptionally conveys the mood of the film's plot all too well . Robert Tayman has quite a malevolent presence , despite his handsome allure which draws women like Ann-Marie to their doom . Jessop has a way of lighting Tayman that gives off a sinister intent , and you can just sense that this poor girl , under his spell , is like a fly caught in the spider's web . Penny Irving is quite uninhibited in this film , not afraid to show her gorgeous naked body , including a rather uncomfortable disrobing scene where she's forced to remove her clothes by Walker and Bates before being taken to her cell .
436192	9938570	69239	7.0	Hungry Wives	Very unusual Romero feature , which to me resembles a Cassavetes film , regarding an emotionally numb housewife , Joanie ( Jan White ) who desires something more than sitting at home while her hippie daughter Nikki ( Joedda McClain ) is out having a good time and husband , Jack ( Bill Thunhurst ) is always away on business . When Jack is home , he's constantly griping about this and that , and her daughter is dating Gregg ( Raymond Laine ) , a young man who embraces a care-free lifestyle and carries a very unappealing disregard for the suburban rich and the old establishment . Joanie's sexual life is anything but grand and she finds herself drawn to Gregg , despite finding his manners off-putting , and is quite uncomfortable with his liberated , unconcerned behavior towards those he finds ugly . Yet , she desires for his touch after arriving home after an unfortunate night with a really troubled neighborhood gal-pal , who Gregg embarrassed earlier in the evening after a visit with a witch ( . . he tricked her into believing that she was smoking marijuana ) , hearing the passions of her daughter being balled by him in Nikki's bedroom . Joanie becomes intrigued with witchcraft after her initial visit with the neighborhood witch , and soon starts dabbling with it after purchasing some items from a store . When Nikki leaves home after realizing her mom was listening to her throes of sexual bliss , Joanie soon supposedly uses a spell on Gregg to seduce him , with an affair as a result . Joanie is also plagued with surreal dreams of a nightmare man ( Bill Hinzman ) breaking into her home , dressed in black with a creepy disfigured mask , chasing after her . . when she attempts to escape Joanie finds that the outer door knobs are either chained or belted . In the opening scene , Joanie has a dream depicting various images of things both from her past ( . . a baby that may've been miscarried , limbs whipping across her face as hubby remains with his face buried in his newspaper unconcerned with her well being and practically ignoring her mere presence , future lover Gregg , among other things like riding a swing ) and possible future , with Romero setting up the fact that this woman is troubled with a variety of emotional problems . I think the film is an experimental , avant-garde way of viewing the psychological torment of a woman needing emotional fulfillment and not finding it . Through the subtle , under-played performance of Jan White ( . . I love an actress who tells us through her eyes what the character is truly going through , even if we can not see it on her face ) , we get an idea of how Joanie is hiding buried desires while attempting to disregard how she truly feels , eventually succumbing to them . I never felt she was a witch who could perform any act of magic , but someone embracing something new and different as a way of bringing meaning to an unrewarding life . Joanie is often shown , when her husband is home ( . . which isn't much ) , miserably withdrawn and perhaps seething with regret ( . . this was what I felt looking at her in the scenes when they are together in bed or at the dinner table ) at ever marrying this man . I don't think many casual horror ( . . and Romero ) fans will cling to " Season of the Witch " for it really isn't a horror film at all despite the deceptive title . More of a bleak study of a woman with too much time on her hands , living an unsatisfied life yearning for something more substantial . My favorite sequences concern Bill Hinzman's masked intruder who rushes Joanie attempting to assault her in her nightmares . Romero uses a lot of expressionistic lighting , often through window shades at night with his camera often closing tightly towards the faces of characters , mainly Joanie and Hinzman's nightmare man . The opening dream sequence is something straight out of Bunuel . . all you'd need is a goat as a finishing touch . Most of the film , though , is dialogue and performance , as the film often scathingly involves the nature of bored housewives , their behavior and gossip . The film very much rides on the success of White's performance because Romero's camera often focuses completely on her face . A great deal of the film is often claustrophobic , taking place in Joanie's home and Romero pretty much captures every aspect inside . . this is indeed Joanie's prison and I felt he does a good job of often confining us to this place . Still , the film is unpolished , often moving at a rather leisurely pace , with abrupt music disrupted by quick cuts from one scene to the next . The print , for which Anchor Bay apologized for , isn't the greatest in the world , looking quite affected by time .
436126	9938570	289438	7.0	School Killer	Why has Ramón ( Carlos Fuentes ) brought his five college mates to a spooky abandoned school building which used to service the black sheep children of wealth ? That answer might just lie in a diary in his possession supposedly written by his dying father . What they come in contact with is in fact a relived episode involving another group of six , with five of them presumably meeting graphic fates at the hands of a sadistic security guard ( Paul Naschy ) which occurred 20 some odd years ago . But , as they seek out a way to escape from this place , terror awaits them as that horrifying moment in time replays as the group run for their lives , often in states of panic as the killer begins to hunt and destroy them in a various bloody ways . Will Ramón and any of his pals survive this night of horror or becomes ghosts forever repeating the very same night like those before them ? Stylish Spanish slasher has that professional gloss and potent , shocking violence to match . Some witty exchanges between the characters . . layered in their dialogue are pop-culture references to American horror films which might annoy some viewers . A demented Naschy is really ferocious with the kiddies as he attacks them gleefully . . quite a bloodthirsty maniac who carries out his violent acts with relish . I found the loud musical cues a bit annoying and the filmmakers often use flashbacks from previous events in the film as reminders to the audience . I don't think these tricks are necessarily needed , but felt the director wished to communicate in depth with the viewer hence the use of cues and flashbacks . A minor diversion for this film's plot keeps moving and the camera follows the pace of the characters and how they react to the chaotic situation presented to them . Your enjoyment of this film may ultimately come down to your acceptance of the paranormal supernatural aspects of the plot . Moments in time relived and a killer who continues his work seemingly from the grave . The twist does seem a bit jarring and abrupt , but this might ( . . or might not ) work considering how the story plays out regarding why Ramón's father is shown amongst those ghosts re-enacting those grisly events two decades prior . I will say that this film probably wouldn't hold up if scrutinized in detail , but as a slasher flick , it's a breath of fresh air .
436213	9938570	48696	7.0	Tarantula	Working on a nutrient experiment that could both grow a food supply large enough to feed an ever growing global populace ( while also hoping to perfect a nutrient that would keep humans from needing food ) , a rare disease called acromegaly ( causes the pituitary gland to malfunction causing facial , neck , hands & feet distortions resulting in suffocation and death towards humans , most of the time over many years after receiving it ) is found in a corpse in the desert near the town of Desert Rock . Professor Gerald Deemer ( Leo G Carroll ) , a nutrient biologist , is the remaining member of a trio working on the experiment , whose colleague and understudy ( both way too eager to see if they had perfected their experiment ) die from acromegaly . The understudy , Paul , revolting against his professor , causes serious damage to their lab while getting his mad revenge by injecting Deemer with their created nutrient . While a fire kills most of the caged animals being experimented on , a tarantula escapes , growing daily in size . On a murderous rampage through the desert , sucking human and cattle dry to the bones , country doctor Matt Hastings ( John Agar ) , Desert Rock sheriff Jack Andrews ( Nestor Paiva ) and Deemer's new understudy Stephanie " Steve " Clayton ( the lovely Mara Corday ) will find themselves in great danger as it leaves puddles of venom as a reminder of where it's been ( . . including rock slides which nearly kill Matt and Steve ) . During the film we , along with Steve , watch as Deemer slowly succumbs to acromegaly attacking his body at an alarming rate . We also watch as the gigantic tarantula scours the desert downing power lines , hovering over screaming human victims with little room to escape , and on the prowl for it's next meal . I guess , many will watch a creature feature such as this one for chuckles and kicks . I admired the effects for a ' 55 film . At the very least , the story's premise was intelligent and thoughtful . . the whole idea that these scientists , thinking about the future and how to thwart starvation and hunger , with their experiments , as always was the case when man attempts to solve the problems we face , ending with tragic consequences . I felt that Deemer seems singled out as a villain , because of his dogged secrecy regarding understudy Paul ( . . and his colleague's fate as well ) , but his overall intentions are good , and perhaps success would've been imminent had his partners been more patient . The effects of the tarantula are flawed , but I admired such effort and there are some nifty scenes such as one where the spider attacks Deemer's home , and another where it knocks over a power pole with sparks flying . If you want to nit-pick , there's room to scrutinize , but I thought this B-movie effort from the great director Jack Arnold was lots of fun . Agar was always a charming and handsome lead , very likable and Mara Corday his equal , as the typical screaming woman running for her life as the tarantula draws near . I think Carroll fits the bill nicely as a scientist who means well , but holds a responsibility for telling the authorities of what had transpired , opting instead to pursuing a breakthrough with his limited time left , receiving his grim fate , often handed down to characters who weren't completely honest when they should've been .
435990	9938570	373889	7.0	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix	Harry Potter's internal struggle with the evil Lord Voldemort is at the heart of this cerebral installment , taking a break from the overpowering action we are used to seeing ( . . tournament wizard contests and such ) instead focusing on a potential threat towards Hogwarts school in the chuckling new professor , Dolores Umbridge ( Imelda Staunton ) with her wide-eyes and seemingly modest exterior harbours an aggressive desire to have full control of the school , operating by her strict standards , attempting to remove wizardry , enabling the students to practice their craft . Secretly a war is brewing between Dumbledore ( Michael Gambon ) and Voldemort with Harry playing a vital chess piece . It will be revealed that either Harry or Voldemort will live but both can not co-exist , a prophesy most certain to propel the next film . But , this film does follow Harry ' further growth as a powerful wizard , and his nemesis particularly in this movie is Umbridge who wishes to silence the young man from even mentioning Voldemort's name . Pursuing the knowledge of casting spells which can protect them from harm , and thus enabling them to join Dumbledore's army , Hermoine ( Emma Watson ) and Ron ( Rupert Grint ) will convince Harry to train volunteers secretly behind Umbridge's back . Harry also converses with his godfather , wrongfully accused serial killer Sirius Black ( Gary Oldman ) who keeps him informed of the latest news regarding what Dumbledore wishes to remain hidden for his safety . We witness a very paranoid Minster of the Ministry of Magic believing that Dumbledore may be enlisting a force against him ( . . perhaps in part to whispers from those who might wish to see Dumbledore out as headmaster of Hogwarts ) and it's visible as the newspapers increase the unease as Potter's claim of Voldemort's return has many split , some considering it bogus , others worried that he's correct . Film still features state-of-the-art special effects ( . . such as our introduction to Hagrid's giant half-brother and the frightening dementors working for Voldemort ) , but the emphasis is more towards Potter as a central figure as turmoil rages within the world of magic and wizardry . While growing into adulthood , the teenage students are forced into adult decisions as secret evils await them and the political order of things is a boiling pot where Voldemort is on the thoughts of everyone even if many would rather remain blinded / oblivious to such a horrifying truth . You get a nifty showdown between Dumbledore and Voldemort and the teen wizards even face off with Voldemort's brood who escape Azkaban . Potter's emergence as a powerful wizard whose humanity is his strength ( . . Voldemort considers him weak because of his emotions for those he loves ) an unfolding character arc because he will be tested against the dark powers with Voldemort desiring to take control of his body . And , a very important plot-point emerges regarding Severus Snape ( Alan Rickman ) and why he holds such a grudge against Harry , concerning Potter's father . Once again we realize that Lucius Malfoy ( Jason Isaacs ) is a dangerous presence in that he's an agent for Voldemort working on the inside , an intruder who can disrupt things within the Ministry of Magic . Helena Bonham Carter returns in a small role as sorceress Bellatrix Lestrange , murdering a major supporting character who was such a guiding force in Harry's life . Above all , the importance of friendship is at the very core of this installment . . Harry needs the support of his friends and allies more than ever before . There's a lot going on and it's clear that the screenplay tries to fit as much as possible from the source novel .
436171	9938570	374180	7.0	Werewolf Hunter : The Legend of Romasanta	A wolf becomes man to seduce and kill female victims in Allariz . Romasanta ( Julian Sands ) goes on record in front of a jury of his peers and the court proclaiming himself a werewolf . Almost all of Romasanta's conquests were not of anything remotely human until he falls in love with Bárbara ( Elsa Pataky , a stunning beauty ) , the sister of his wife and mute child . When Romasanta kills his wife , María ( Maru Valdivielso ) and mute child Teresa ( Luna McGill ) , Bárbara seeks him out after being seduced herself by him . Joining forces with DA Bastida ( Bary Piquer ) they are on the hunt to find him before more and more lives are taken by the wolf . With help by Antonio ( John Sharian ) , someone bitten and controlled by Romasanta , they might just be able to find him . Professor Philips ( David Grant is a persuasive doctor who proclaims that Romasanta is not responsible for the killer impulses the wolf brings out . Handsome production and great photography help the flick which doesn't produce the goods in werewolf transformations , instead opting for being a historical document on a serial killer stating on record he is a werewolf who can not help but kill when the beast comes out to play . The acting is adequate and there are a few brief moments of violence , but many viewers wanting a full-fledged creature feature with gory attacks will be disappointed , perhaps even bored . But , the film is well made and visually sumptuous . Just don't expect blood and guts .
435826	9938570	73820	8.0	Trilogy of Terror	Director Dan Curtis , along with writers Nolan and Matheson , craft three tales all starring Karen Black as the leading female character of each one . The first tale concerns a polite , well mannered , soft-spoken , nerdy seemingly naive ( . . and too trusting ) school teacher who is blackmailed by a student who drugged her , sexually taking advantage of her while unconscious after slipping something in her soda at a drive-in movie . A photographer , Chad ( Robert Burton ) believes he can just do whatever he wishes with Julie ( Black ) if she wishes to continue teaching , but he doesn't really know who's truly in charge . . The second tale is quite a doozy , a real chance for Black to shine as she portrays dual ( . . emphasis on dual ) characters , supposed sisters . . the repressed , ugly spinster Millicent who wishes to end her sister , the seductive floozy blonde Therese's evil ways . Therese , according to Millicent , is a follower of Satan who practices witchcraft , and attempts to warn her boyfriend Thomas ( John Karlen , of Dark Shadows & " Daughters of Darkness " ) before " it's too late " , revealing her possibly murdering their mother and having an incestuous affair with their father . But , there's a mystery about these sisters which only their doctor , Chester Ramsey ( George Gaynes ) truly knows about . The third , and most popular which has earned this televised film it's cult status , concerns this innocent woman , Amelia , whose putty in her overbearing mother's hands , alone in her apartment with a Zuni fetish doll , whose gold chain ( around the doll's waist to keep the African hunter's spirit from attacking ) falls off releasing it to terrorize her . This claustrophobic entry has Amelia running around her apartment , trying desperately to escape harm's way , slowly finding less places to hide while it stalks her with a kitchen knife . The climax to this one , when Amelia attempts to cook it in a stove , and how Black performs it , is a hoot . The grand stage for Karen Black ( . . and , boy , does she show her stuff ) where she's able to showcase a wide range of characters , each different than the next . While , I felt the third one is the most terrifying , delivering the most thrills , I think the other two tales provide Black with an opportunity ( . . if she hadn't done so already ) to show her audience just what kind of versatility she had . There's also a phone conversation ( . . the actress claims she re-wrote herself with Curtis ' permission ) in the third tale between Amelia and her mother that really develops the character well . . we see how Amelia is manipulated by her irksome mother , only through Black's voice and response . But , my favorite performance ( s ) of Black was in the second tale where we see two completely different characters , with a major discovery that links them . The first story , and my least favorite , is more of a case of " nothing is what it seems " where one character , who seems the tragic victim of deception , is actually the predator not prey . If you are a fan of Ms . Black , then this " science fiction " anthology ( . . Curtis , Black & Matheson all hate the descriptive term " horror " when used for " Trilogy of Terror " ) is a must-see .
435964	9938570	70423	8.0	The Freakmaker	A university professor by day , mad scientist by night , Dr . Nolter ( Donald Pleasence exuding a quiet mania , portraying his character as someone completely convinced that his work is for the betterment of mankind despite how diabolical his methods are ) , respected by his peers , creates hybrid plant-humans in a goal to form a new evolution of mankind , using his own students brought to him by a carnival owner , Lynch ( Tom Baker , under effective hideous facial make-up ) plagued with the glandular Elephant Man disease . Lynch believes reluctantly that Nolter will cure him of his problem , for which he continues delivering specimens , but as friends of bio-chemistry wunderkind Brian Redford ( Brad Harris ) and Hedi ( Julie Ege ) come up missing , it's only a matter of time before the professor's ghoulish experiments and Lynch's kidnapping will be discovered . Lynch has another problem of his own making . . he treats his carnival employees ( . . freaks , to the " normal " audience who cheer , sneer & fear them during shows ) cruelly , displaying an ugliness just as much inside as outside . Lynch's crew have tolerated his insults and nasty treatment for a long time , and this film shows how his behavior towards them will result in a violent revolt echoing Tod Browning's masterpiece " Freaks . " And , as typical of " mad scientist " movies , the creation will get revenge on it's creator . . Nolter creates a plant-man who ingests humans for consumption from a belligerent student of his who always replied in classes against his theories . Macabre premise delivers some shocking moments including Nolter's creations and how one of them eats a street bum . Nolter's fate is especially grotesque . Baker is far removed from his charismatic , charming Doctor Who in portraying quite a tormented monster of a man who will do anything to remove the diseased face that keeps him removed from the society he yearns for . I found the seedy elements startling . . such as Lynch's finding a prostitute willing to yield to his desires for a certain fee , the numerous displays of female nudity , and how female specimens have their clothes removed while unconscious on Nolter's laboratory slab before being experimented on . But , despite all the rather unpleasant mutations we are witnesses to , the opening of the plant cycle , set to rather unnerving music , actually was as effective ( . . if not more ) to me than what comes after . And , director Cardiff has a lengthly showcase for the " freaks " of the carnival , with the viewer as " grossed out " or transfixed by each representative allowed to display their abnormality , as the audience in attendance . The script can be quite literate , whose " science-speak " might bore many viewers . If you're wondering whether or not Pleasence is hammy , he's indeed quite low-key , playing the doctor with a calm confidence .
436485	9938570	808276	8.0	Cold Prey	Geniuinely terrifying nail-biting slasher which is so competently made using suspense instead of sheer gore , despite the formulaic trappings often associated within the popular sub-genre . The key is the setting and the killer . The setting , an abandoned ski-lodge isolated in the middle of Norwegian snowy mountains , miles upon miles away from civilization . A group of skiers , young adults on their way to a lodge when deciding to snow board down and over potentially dangerous terrain leaves one among them with a broken ankle . Finding the the ski lodge as refuge , the group will decide to spend the night waiting for morning to go for help . They , however , are not alone . . a hulking menace , hidden underneath pounds of protective clothing , carrying a pickax he swings with a vengeance , the group will find themselves in for one hell of a nightmare . Ingrid Bolsø Berdal is the final girl , Jannicke , who is placed in quite a predicament when her friends and lover are being stalked and killed , having to protect her handicapped comrade , Morten Tobias ( Rolf Kristian Larsen , the comedy relief of the picture ) , whose broken ankle provides quite the detriment towards fleeing quickly as the menace draws near . As many final girls in slashers are , Jannicke is resourceful , quick-thinking , and courageous , attempting to stay one step ahead of the killer who knows this difficult environment a lot more than she does . Her lover , Eirik ( Tomas Alf Larsen ) was on his way to get help , when he is upended by the killer . Young couple , Mikal ( Endre Martin Midtstigen ) and Ingunn ( Viktoria Winge ) , having been together only a short amount of time but are crazy for each other , round out the cast of potential casualties . The opening of the film , concerning a scar-faced kid possibly being buried alive as snow topples upon him by an unseen assailant , and the dangerous manhunt to find him , making headlines ( . . this was in ' 75 ) is set up for a reason understood later . Many will find that this slasher operates under the normal guidelines instituted since the 70's . It doesn't stray too far from what you expect , all the way to the conclusion . BUT , director Roar Uthaug , despite this , is able to create an incredible sense of terror , and my nails were bitten to the quick , even though I had a good idea how it'd all end . The menace just comes out of nowhere ready to plunge that pickax into bodies with a ferocity you feel when it seldom misses destroying objects in the vicinity . And , the horrifying situation the characters are stuck in ( . . thanks to the setting which echos THE THING and , the feeling of no escape , evoking WOLF CREEK ) really grips you ( . . well , it did me ) . It might not be original , but it's so damn well made , with Uthaug squeezing every bit of dread he can get out of the cold and inhospitable ski-lodge and Jotunheimen's wintry mountainside . . it does take a while for the killer to make his presence known with Uthaug carefully establishing the characters ( . . he even shoots some angles as if through the eyes of the killer , peeping in on their conversations before striking ) . Little things are also expertly presented for later use in the film like a shot gun shell and a key-ring with a teddy bear . I hope to see more from this director because his action scenes are briskly filmed , with exciting photography capturing the characters , as they attempt to stay alive while being stalked , extraordinarily well .
436003	9938570	78087	8.0	The Scarecrow reviews " Piranha "	I want anyone reading this to know that my review is full of spoilers for to explain my opinions on why Dante's film so good depends on many plot points being exploited to make my point . One of the most important aspects of the film that I feel made Dante's film better than many of the horror pictures that would splatter on screens in the 80's , 90's , & even today is his depiction of the characters in the film . Unlike many horror films where the characters are so one sided ( most of the time simply unlikable ) where we just don't really care if they live or die thanks to the writers and direction , it's quite clear that Dante does . The children at the camp and their female counselors who are attacked are not bad people . One camp counselor who perishes is a good , warm hearted person who doesn't deserve to die . That specific scene is built unrelentingly by Dante . Throughout the film , Dante builds in our eyes the fact that piranha fish a heading to munch on unsuspected people who venture into waters they have no right believing are dangerous . That tension that Dante builds works because we know that if no one warns them in time , people will die quite horribly . I can only speak with the heart of a parent when I say that the moment the piranha fish begin to attack the children my heart beat 90 miles an hour . The film had been up to that point one of those very funny spoofs which uses clever humorous wit within it's shots at government's hidden secrets at developing war weaponry ( in this case piranha to " poison " the waters of Vietnam , but the project was halted when the conflict was deemed over ) that could have an aftereffect on Americans . But , once sweet innocent children ( just simply having water competitions ) are beginning to be attacked , the film carries a much more serious tone . The build up to a feeding is hauntingly done with a few actually paying the price for what their government ( who was suppose to protect not destroy ) did to them . But , things are even more grim when tourists are viciously attacked during a water festival . We see an explosion of horror as innocents out in the water are being torn to shreds . Body parts are shown throughout and much blood . The fun from the opening turns grisly as we see what can happen when a government goes to far , and in their ineptitude don't finish a clean-up job eradicating something they created in a lab . But , in returning to my position above , Dante's treatment of his characters is essential , I believe , to how I was impacted . Dante cloaks his female camp counselors with sweet music . We hear them talk and see how good they are to the children . They aren't like the sex-crazed counselors you might see in other films . Their language isn't obscene . They never gesture that dislike their jobs or those kids they are assigned to . When we see one of them trying to escape into a raft during the attack on the children , there was a realization that this woman was in trouble of dying . We see her helplessly try to grab hold to her friend's hand , but the vicious attack from those monsters in the water just won't release her . In a moment that just won't leave me , Dante shows the piranha carry her into the darkened emptiness of the water and she's lost to us all . It's a scene that devastates me because she's not a stupid ingrate that we often see in horror films , but a very likable human being who is taken away to be slaughtered . The final closing scene shows the aftermath of many dead because the man in charge of the festival wouldn't heed the warning of a woman who knew that the piranha were heading their way . The film shows that in not at least taking a warning seriously could lead to such horror . Dante won't let the viewer off the hook . He lets us see the piranha swimming in a pack heading for people who do not know what is coming . Dante could let our heroes get to the children in time and the tourists in time , but many will meet their doom . Dante delivers on the gore . He achieves both levels . The impact of the building up of the attack and subsequent violence that will certainly occur . We see heads eating , legs bitten off , blood soaking with shards of meat in the water , and the aftermath . In the final scene , the festival owner ( as the camp head looks over the sheeted body of a child he'd been warned to protect ahead of time ) looks over the sheet-covered bodies of victims , those who simply came to the beach to swim and have a good time . Sure , perhaps our heroes were able ( ? ) to poison the piranha with waste , but the aftermath is what leaves the viewer knowing that it is little too late to save those who weren't warned that it was quite possible that they could've been attacked . Yet , even then Dante gives them reason . They hear a call ( both the head of the camp and the festival head ) from a person that tells them deadly piranha fish are heading their direction . It would perhaps elicit laughter ( or disbelief ) from you to , wouldn't it ? You see Dante and writer John Sayles cover all bases . The film , I feel , is really good because it builds up and then delivers .
436136	9938570	90094	8.0	The Stuff	Larry Cohen , that independent genre renegade whose films often look as if they were thrown together with adhesive tape , returns to spoof The Blob and commercial marketing with this often witty and goofy tale about an alien goo that has bubbled from the center of the Earth , discovered by an industrial worker and manufactured as a tasty yogurt . This goo , over time , begins to take control of the human host in a diabolical plan to obviously take over the world . Enter ex-FBI industrial spy extraordinaire , Mo Rutherford ( Michael Moriarty ) paid to infiltrate the manufacturers of " The Stuff " ( . . the commercial name for the goo that is sweeping the nation ) to find the secret of how it's made finding out instead what the goo really is . Joining forces with Nicole ( Andrea Marcovicci ) , a marketing guru truly responsible for how well The Stuff has profited , who feels she's to blame for how the goo has begun to take control of her fellow humankind . Also , Mo will find another unlikely ally in young Jason ( Scott Bloom ) whose parents have become afflicted with the goo , a kid who saw first hand how the substance " moved " while surfing through the refrigerator one night . Jason made futile attempts to destroy tubs of The Stuff in a rampage through a supermarket which was printed in the newspaper and is how Mo found out about his knowledge in the secret conspiracy . Another ally is " Chocolate Chip " Charlie ( . . the scene-stealing Garrett Morris , who Cohen just turned loose , unbridled ) whose business was stolen right out from under him by those who make The Stuff . Mo finds out where the main manufacturing site is at and , along with Nicole and Jason , will attempt to find out exactly how the goo is distributed and created . After this happens , Mo will then coerce paranoid , very intense , military man , Colonel Malcolm Grommett Spears ( Paul Sorvino , hilarious as a leader so intense he could crush walnuts with his ass ) into assisting him in crushing the " goo regime . " As always , Moriarty has a ball as the laid-back , confident , cocky , non-chalant , quietly determined anti-hero who never wavers in his goal to find the truth for his employer , while also black-mailing a few along the way such as NYC businessman , Fletcher ( Patrick O'Neal ) . He's quite a spy who seems completely unflinching in the path of danger . I'm certain Cohen let him ad-lib with some zingers during very funny gore-scenes concerning humans falling to waste as the goo exits their mouths . There are scenes very reminiscent to The Blob where a river of white goo travels towards potential victims , often almost trapping them . There are some crude effects mixed with some stunning ones . I loved the icky effects where human faces melt as the goo comes up from inside them , out their mouths . We actually see a punch from Mo break apart a goo-infected man's face ! There's a truly bizarre scene where the goo attacks Mo and Nicole in their bedroom nearby the manufacturing plant where fire is used with very outrageous results . It seems that fire can be used as an agent to hurt the goo , such as when it attaches to the faces of victims . And , the commercials of The Stuff ( . . enough is never enough ) are perfectly realized jabs at marketers seducing the public to consume their products . I'm not sure myself what exactly Cohen is targeting , a many number of things I gather ( Coca-cola , hamburgers , who knows ? ) , but the end result tickles the funny-bone . He also pokes fun at the family dynamic as young Jason rebels against his parents ' wishes to eat his yogurt because " it's good for him . " Also , taking playful jabs at military men who are obsessive with their beliefs in evil Commies and secret conspiracies against America , using up-tight , foul-mouthed womanizing Colonel Spears ( . . initially Mo threatens Spears with certain evidence regarding his visit with a prostitute ) as a model . Sorvino just buries himself in this parody , head-to-toe . If you are familiar with Cohen's style , which is anything but conventional , then " The Stuff " will be a treat ( . . pun intended ) .
436346	9938570	37168	8.0	The Pearl of Death	This time a sought after Borgia Pearl is the object of desire , worth snapping the lumbar vertebrae of many unfortunate victims ' backs at the hands of the sinister Creeper ( Rondo Hatton ) , working for a lecherous thief , the devilish , elusive Giles Conover ( Miles Mander ) . Sherlock Holmes and Dr . Watson are out to discover why innocent people are found dead , their china dishes broken all over the crime scenes . A Borgia Pearl was stolen by Conover in a daring heist actually caused when Holmes himself proved to the museum curator that his security system was flawed , inadvertently assisting the conniving con artist who almost got away with it . Conover had to get rid of the pearl temporarily and Holmes & Watson soon discover that it was hidden in one of six plaster busts of Napoleon . . it's essential that Holmes get to the bust containing the pearl before Conover and The Creeper do , or else another victim might be targeted . Of course , Holmes must contend with Scotland Yard's Inspector Lastrade ( Dennis Hoey ) , who is assigned to the rash of serial killings , having to tolerate his temperament and obtrusive attitude . Along the way , Holmes ' life is in danger because he poses a threat to Conover's plans . Universal Studio's regular Evelyn Ankers has a substantial supporting role as Conover's lovely partner-in-crime , Naomi Drake , who uses aliases and disguises to secure information for her protégé . Hatton's The Creeper is quite an effectively spooky villain , barely seen but quite established thanks to director Roy William Neill's superb methods of building his presence until his reveal late into the film . Rathbone is more intense in this film , because of his treatment by authoritative figures and the press who blame him personally for the loss of the pearl , and Bruce's lovable Watson almost gets his best friend killed when Conover attempts to kill the Baker Street sleuth with a book containing a springing dagger . Mander , as Conover , has a very wily villain which contends with Moriarty as one of Holmes ' more despicable and challenging foes . The Universal Studios production values add immensely to the beautiful look of the film and this cast couldn't be much better . Macabre plot , to boot .
435993	9938570	483607	8.0	Doomsday	The Reaper virus devastated a portion of Scotland with England building a steel , reinforced barrier splitting apart Great Britain . With signs of the Reaper virus reawakening in London , and the photographic evidence of those who have survived on the opposite side , quarantined away from " civilization " , the British government ( . . or what's left of it ) desires for a commando unit , led by someone of great skill and leadership ( . . able enough to pull off such a difficult , seemingly impossible feat ) , to find the cure which has allowed those uninfected to survive where the Reaper virus had ran rampant . Selected to lead the team is one-eyed Major Eden Sinclair ( Rhona Mitra ) , a skilled marksman with no fear , always calculating her next move , with an ability to handle chaos when others might falter . She is seen at the opening as the little girl whose eye was shot by a soldier with a hair trigger and is sent away by her mother on board a helicopter to safety as the madness of frightened citizens seeking refuge from being quarantined are all around her . Eden wears a high-tech eye which works as a video recording device and camera . She also has a watch which feeds her information from the eye . The soldiers under her wear the typically black hi-tech gear and carry the elaborate rifles able to blast the enemy with range and precision . They enter the quarantined Scotland inside armored tank-vehicles with security cameras and weaponry equipped to handle an army of marauders and savages as the case will soon become . They encounter a society of leather-clad , immoral cannibalistic , barbaric punks with mohawks , facial make-up , and piercings , a direct representation of a world gone terribly wrong it seems . They seem to have a singular mission , to harm and destroy , and those who decide to infiltrate " their city " are slaughtered . Eden and her commandos ( . . or those left after the savages pick them apart ) are to find a Doctor Marcus Kane ( Malcolm McDowell , whose chilling narration opens the film , informing the viewers of the horrifying future as it unfolded before the true plot forges ahead ) who was working on a cure before murder and mayhem arises having him flee with men elsewhere . Kane's son , Sol ( Craig Conway , letting it hall hang out ) , is the psychotic leader of his fanatical army , actually holding his decent and scared sister , Cally ( MyAnna Buring ) prisoner , planning much worse for Eden . Cally knows where Kane is and will lead Eden to his location . What lies in wait for Eden is a now diabolically mad Kane , who has built a new life for himself and those who followed him out of Sol's city , living within the confines of a medieval castle fortress , adopting a new type of civilization away from the past , isolated from the memories of yore , building an empire which threatens anyone from the other side . Obviously director Neil Marshall was inspired by his beloved influences , creating a wonderfully wicked hodgepodge of Escape from New York , The Road Warrior and 28 Days Later . . This will be considered a travesty by some , ripping off films from the past , but I saw it differently , working more as a homage , gloriously embedding the viewer into a harsh climate of violence and despair , a grim post-apocalyptic nightmare where all hope seems lost and only the mad or infinitely corrupt survive . Eden is a symbol of strength , fortitude , smarts , and cool . . a charismatic and formidable opponent towards those who wish nothing but hostility and death towards those they consider responsible for the pitiful conditions brought on by circumstances out of control . Those abandoned and left for dead cry out by inflicting misery on outsiders who pose a threat to their way of life and purpose . Featuring a Reaper virus quite similar to the one released by the monkey in 28 Days Later . . Eden is a female equivalent of Snake Plisskin , even missing an eye and wearing a patch ( . . and has a locater device which is smashed to pieces not longer after entering the quarantined zone ) And Sol's punks are very reminiscent to the violent freaks and weirdos from The Road Warrior . There's something quite surreal about seeing an action heroine facing off with a vicious punk one moment , and a massive soldier in gladiatorial combat within a suit of armour , not long after . One moment freaks on motorcycles and a graffiti-covered beat-up bus ( hearkening back to Hill's The Warriors ) are after Eden , the next Kane's men on horseback with a suit of armour , swords in hand , with archers equipped with a bow and arrows . Then the masterfully designed chase on the open roads as Sol's gang ( . . in modified vehicles featuring their deranged style ) are after Eden and company ( . . driving a Bentley they found in an abandoned warehouse ) featuring bristling scenes where crashes are imminent , across a gorgeous picturesque countryside with winding roads . Bashed in heads , a bunny rabbit blown to bits by an automatic machine gun , a victim cooked over an open fire as Sol's people celebrate a cannibalistic feast , imaginative beheadings galore . . lots of ultra-violence in store for those who crave such things . Marshall adopts modern techniques which might repel many . . quick cuts and breathlessly paced camera work are featured during the action sequences whether it be hand-to-hand combat or cars crashing into each other . Solid cast featuring Bob Hoskins as Eden's guiding influence Bill Nelson bringing his usual commanding presence to the film in an almost thankless role , Alexander Siddig as the Prime Minister , a rather spineless leader for a nation who has been abandoned by the other parts of the world , and David O'Hara as Canaris , the cold-blooded lieutenant who truly calls the shots , using his boss as a tool , just waiting to take his place . Great role for Mitra who conveys confidence and quiet swagger , also having the precise look needed to fulfill the role demanded of her . The Reaper virus is a nasty plague where humans ' faces are bombarded with hideous sores and cause the hemorrhaging of blood .
436354	9938570	58403	8.0	William Castle's The Night Walker	Howard Trent ( Hayden Rorke ) , hideous face with creepy white eyes , whose cane taps the floor loudly wherever he walks , suspects his wife , Irene ( Barbara Stanwyck ) of adultery due to her " sleep-talking " embracing her gentleman caller within the realm of blissful fantasy . He suspects that his attorney , and confident , Barry Moreland ( the dashing Robert Taylor , always the kind of leading man with the ability to conceal whether he's trustworthy or carrying malicious intent ) of being her lover . The third party of the story is private investigator George Fuller , hired by the insanely jealous Howard to follow Irene . When Howard dies in an explosion within his private laboratory , Irene is haunted by dreams / nightmares depicting her dream love ( Lloyd Bochner ) , Howard's interference on her encounters with him and various places that she is taken by her fantasy-man which feel so incredibly & vividly real . With Trent's hesitant assistance ( he carries a look of concern for Irene as if wondering whether or not she should see a shrink ) , Irene seeks answers to the riddles of her dreams and does indeed find that places she was taken to by her dream lover are real , but unlike the way she saw them the night before . Does Irene truly experience real encounters with a real man , or is she truly completely bonkers ? Through the wizardry of director William Castle and writer Robert Bloch , this wonderfully campy delight runs the gamut of twists and surprises . They use dreams / nightmares as a psychological tool to craft their tale and we follow Irene's journey through the unusual crisis she faces . I thought Rorke's Howard was perfectly sinister . . they really dress him up as a creepy intruder to Irene's serene , while also strange , encounters with her ideal man . Taylor , as I mentioned above , again appears sympathetic to Irene's cause , showing that he would like to believe that what she experiences is true . The third party , Lloyd Bochner has a pivotal role in this flick . . his character is the one who leads Irene through all the bizarre scenarios that occur in the supposed dream-world they inhabit . One particular sequence , my favorite of the film , has Bochner's dream man and Irene associated in an eerie ceremony , in a chapel , where the parties involved ( priest , pianist & witnesses ) are plastic mannequins , interrupted by Howard . The film opens splendidly with a montage of images with the deep resonant voice of the narrator asking us , " What are your dreams " What do they mean ? What do you know about the secret world you visit when you sleep ? " It goes on for minutes and I can imagine the groaning of many having to sit through it . But , I thought it was hokey , well-intentioned fun . Babs ' histrionics might make her devoted fans cringe , and her character is a bit naive , but she's always a pleasure to watch . I've read that many compare this film to Babs to Crawford's final role in TROG , but I think that's way off base . If you love William Castle and know what to expect ( . . gorgeous B & W moody cinematography , a plethora of red herrings piled on each other , schlocky & gimmicky narrative ) , this should be right up your alley .
436032	9938570	47424	8.0	Rogue Cop	Cop-on-the-take Sgt Chris Kelvaney ( Robert Taylor ) vows to take down the two mob bosses , Dan Beaumonte ( George Raft ) & Ackerman ( Robert F Simon ) responsible for the death of his straight-arrow beat cop brother Eddie ( Steve Forrest ) . The drama starts when a lowlife named ' Wrinkles ' Fallon ( Peter Brocco ) kills a man in this gaming place . The man responsible for placing the ID on Fallon was Eddie who would receive a commendation for his work in bringing a killer to justice . But , Fallon is a photographer / blackmailer who captured Beaumonte and Ackerman snuffing someone out and he needs to be freed from jail or they take the fall . Beaumonte puts pressure on Chris to convince Eddie it's best not to keep his story on Fallon legit or else . But , Eddie is an honest product of his pop's raising and will not follow in his crooked brother's footsteps . Chris finds out that Eddie's new squeeze Karen ( Janet Leigh ) was once a mobster's moll from Florida and tries to convince her to talk sense into him against remaining loyal to keeping Fallon in prison . With Beaumonte and Ackerman squirmy and nervous about being taken down , they bring a foreign hit-man in to put away Eddie . Beaumonte has a lovely alcoholic moll Nancy ( Anne Francis ) who embarrasses him with her stumbling around and little jokes and cans her out on the street to another gangster for which she opens her mouth about certain things she knows . . Beaumonte now sets his sights on wringing her neck as well . Through it all , Chris will go rogue as his own as his superiors will desire his badge and resignation for his being under the mob's payroll , but not before he finds the man responsible for Eddie's death . He plans to not only take out the hit-man , but the two mob bosses as well in a climactic shootout with assistance of good cop Sidney ( Robert Ellenstein ) who feels resentment from the sergeant for not going the crooked route . Taylor gets a really juicy role as a crooked cop certainly a bit responsible for his brother's death . He has to face the music when it comes to his activities with the mob and this film puts it to him , but Taylor is good at getting sympathy from the viewer despite his nose-thumbing at being the honest , hard-working cop instead of getting paid , no matter who is forking over the extra salary lining your pockets . George Raft also is quite effective as a real scumbag mobster who says what he means , to the point with little in the way of small talk . Janet Leigh doesn't have to stretch too much . . it's her looks this film is aiming for . . that and to poke away at Chris ' heart . She's the one who he can speak to as the world caves in around him . . when both the police and the mob turn their cold shoulders to him . Sure , it's of his own making , but that's what makes the role so juicy for Taylor . . it's not black & white at all , but all sorts of shades of grey . The film is ultimately about redemption , setting things straight , and accepting the life you've lived with all the problems that capsize because of it . Anne Francis gets one of her best roles as a moll who genuinely loved her man and seems damned for pushing him too far .
436549	9938570	424136	8.0	Hard Candy	No mistake about it , this film is a daring one to make . We essentially see this 13 year old girl , howbeit a bright , " smart way beyond her years " drug and torture a 33 year old pedophile for an hour and a half or so . This film cleverly dares to show this girl actually out-dueling , psychologically , a man who has wooed quite a few teenagers . To have an entire film set in one general location for most of the way and have these two hold our interest is an amazing feat . This film has something to say and is clearly an indictment on pedophilia and it's damages . For a film to turn the tables in another direction where the predator becomes the prey is quite a challenge . I think this film succeeds . Casting is certainly key . Patrick Wilson really is a perfect choice for the role of Jeff , the photographer who can flash his profession in the face of pretty young things with the throwaway exuberance of those " possible future models " expected . Patrick's frat-boy looks and calm reserve really fit right for this pedophile . He looks like a perfectly normal man who we'd have a hard time believing could be such a monster when all to his lonesome gazing at a computer screen probing away on the internet superhighway for that chance to get that young virginal lay . But , Ellen Page is the revelation here . She absolutely dominates the screen with this allure director David Slade visually captures with his camera . You instantly believe her as " Hayley " and her transformation from what Jeff believes she is to who she REALLY is , this is startling to behold . She is able to toy with him and see through him . Understanding who Jeff really is through carefully studied research makes this film quite fascinating as it develops . She knows all his secrets and he is ultimately at her mercy . What TRULY motivates Hayley's vengeance , and how does it involve a missing girl and Jeff's former lover ? These questions are answered and we see who Jeff really is after Hayley gets done with him .
436257	9938570	82869	8.0	Outland	Often this is regarded as HIGH NOON in space , and to a point it is very western flavored not to mention has elements one might could possibly claim as lifted from that classic Zinnemann film . First , Connery as the marshal of this mining outpost is the only one with enough integrity to stand up against corruption in the name of general manager Peter Boyle on Io , a moon with precious resources near Jupiter . As Cooper was in HIGH NOON , Connery will seek help and find none . The only one willing to stick their neck out is a woman . Sternhagen is the woman here as Kelly was in HIGH NOON for Cooper . Sternhagen ( a wonderfully underrated actress ; has the best lines in the film and is a joy to watch . . the perfect Howard Hawks ' archetype ) portrays a doctor who tends to everyone who gets hurt and knows how the entire outpost functions . She is there for Connery when no one else will stand up . Connery discovers that Boyle , through two drug suppliers , has been selling amphetamines to labor workers so that they can pull extra hours in order to break productivity records and make big dollars . Boyle is quite a shady character ; his reputation is so notorious no one on the outpost dares cross him . Those who offer help are executed . . such as one officer under Connery who was taking pay from Boyle to look the other way , but gained guilt and turned to the right side . This was a warning to Connery just how dangerous Boyle could be . When an attempt to kill Connery fails , the marshal discovers where the drugs are hidden and dumps them . Boyle , furious at the money he lost because of this , sends for bounty hunters to execute Connery . The final twenty or so harrowing minutes shows Connery having to find various ways to escape certain harm as the killers arrive and seek him out . The cat and mouse ensues but Connery will have assistance in Sternhagen . This film doesn't show off fancy effects but instead makes this outpost ugly , grimy , and very junk-metallic . I felt the film desires to show you a blue-collar future where workers look like people who actually operate oil-rigs and work in factories . The film utilizes Connery's abilities especially as he waits out the arrival of those killers , his dogged determination to take down corruption , his inner loneliness and longing to be back with his family , and especially his weariness of doing his job the right way with no one appreciating his efforts .
435949	9938570	443496	8.0	Edmond	David Mamet scripted this existential undertaking directed by horror-meister Stuart Gordon about Edmond's slow journey into an abyss of sadness after leaving his wife . It really is a series of encounters that mold and shape Edmond into the unrecognizable man he'll wind up being by the end of the film . Startling and unpredictable , Edmond's search for truth and meaning in his life yields some very disturbing elements and nearly everyone he meets in the film have their own problems . But , Edmond's mental well being shifts to a dark place for those demons which have festered inside him come out and what we see as they do is quite throttling . . the violence that occurs to him and BY HIM is very potent and surprising because it often comes out of left field and hits us with it's spontaneity . The meandering dialogue is quite fascinating and often we simply listen to Edmond as he speaks from his embittered heart and fragile , cracking mind . There's a moments where he proclaims his life is 40-something years of fog . I think that the fog separates , but what comes from Edmond is not quite pretty , and often baffling . He is definitely yearning for something to hang his hat on and I believe Mamet's story is saying perhaps what he's looking for is there or not . Stunning cast , but Macy is simply amazing . He is in every scene and his character's struggles are quite intriguing to behold . I felt as if we were watching this man's life simply come apart at the very seems . Seeing that can be quite an experience , and this film is .
435793	9938570	55913	8.0	Divorce - - Italian Style	Marcello Mastroianni stars a Ferdinando Cefalú , a baron of a dishonored family who lustfully longs for his cousin , Angela ( the luscious Stefania Sandrelli ) . He has a wife , Rosalia ( Daniela Rocca ) who longs for attention and probes constantly of whether he loves her not . She is such an annoyance , he begins a scheme to corrupt her finding an old love from the past , a painter restorer Carmelo ( Leopoldo Trieste ) . Divorce in Italy is a no-no , but if a spouse is caught in the act of adultery , murder might be seen as merely a way of saving one's honor at such a disgraceful act . This is Ferdinando's desire . . to match his wife and her former love together and , upon catching them embracing , murdering them so that he can rightfully pursue Angela . Hilarious consequences ensue . This film is quite a treat . . it doesn't miss a note . There's a very funny plug for Fellini's " La Dolce Vita " ( starring Mastroianni ) towards the end of the film which is supposed to be a set-up for Ferdinando's catching them together at his home as he is away to the cinema . The ending has a great sense of irony as we see this man approaching 40 doing what he can to be with a 16 year old teen who is the daughter of his sister . That seems a bit taboo in itself , but the film is about exposing , and poking fun at , taboos .
436811	9938570	59311	9.0	Incubus	Kia ( Allyson Ames ) is a succubus working for the God of Darkness who is bored with luring already lost souls to hell . She wants to be a major factor in the Dark Lord's legion and thirsts for the desire to turn a pure soul to the dark side . Kia's sister Amael ( Eloise Hardt ) , warns her that doing this might be a very bad idea , but she is determined to carry it out . The challenge she hungers for becomes quite great when she chooses Marc ( William Shatner ) , a man who is deemed heroic by a warning Amael who says he saved several men from a fire without any fear of death . Marc's faith in God is strong . When Amael sees that Kia has fallen in love with Marc , she sees an opportunity to turn Marc over by abusing his sister Arndis ( Ann Atmar ) by calling an incubus ( Milos Milos ) to harm her . This film is truthfully about good versus evil , an age-old theme which never tires because so many difficult stories spurn from it . In this film , Marc will have to overcome a lot of adversity because the evil side are nefariously sneaky in causing great harm to your emotional state , challenging your will of purity at it's core . On the other side , Kia is shown as a woman of pure evil who finds love and acceptance from a pure man she can not seem to separate from . The film is very , very good . . better than I possibly could imagine . It plays like a feature length " OUter Limits " episode and I was kind of hoping it would be that way . It has eerie , darkened black and white photography and the music is creepy . The way it is shot is also a plus . . a lot of talented people came together to make this film . The novelty of it being in Esperanto does increase the film's cult status , but it's the overall ominous mood and the way the characters are lensed for which I'd say try this little recently restored gem ( actually the restoration was produced by SCi-fi Channel ) .
436941	9938570	72288	9.0	Thunderbolt and Lightfoot .	Preparations are in order to rob Montana Armoured when a young goof-ball roadie named Lightfoot ( Jeff Bridges , nothing short of amazing ) convinces ex-bank robber Thunderbolt ( Clint Eastwood , very mellow and pleasant in this particular film ) and his ex-heister partners ( Geoffrey Lewis as Goody & George Kennedy as the extremely volatile Red Leary . . who originally plan to kill Thunderbolt believing he hid the loot they stole from that very bank of Montana Armoured ten years prior ) to attempt the daring feat of working over a bank twice . It's a ballsy suggestion , but Thunderbolt gives it considerable thought and talks his " pals " into making plans to commit to robbing it . But , Red doesn't like the young drifter and swears that harm will come to him after the heist is over . Red has some issues controlling his anger and his partner Goody often receives the brunt of the punishment . This is a heist film so you know even if the robbery goes well , complications are bound to ensue , especially when you have a partner like Red who can not control his rage . At first the film is a road movie with Thunderbolt and Lightfoot bonding almost , if not , like brothers . They grow on each other , and that chemistry between Eastwood and Bridges is a pleasure to watch . Kennedy really plays Red like a fireball operating on a very short fuse . Lewis is pitch-perfect as the unfortunate punching bag of Red , though he doesn't deserve to be treated the way he is . . he's loyal , but not a violent man . Perhaps associating himself with Red was not wise and would certainly lead to an early grave . The film is filled with colorful characterizations , but this provides Jeff Bridges with the perfect star vehicle to show his incredible talent .
435811	9938570	54988	9.0	Homicidal	Emily ( Jean Arless ) is so beautiful , yet so . . HOMICIDAL ! ! We watch as this blonde bombshell murders a justice-in-peace after coercing a bellhop , through a substantial sum , to marry her and this opens up the movie ! You know right here that this woman is truly nuts because director William Castle shoots her demented eyes close-up as she stabs repeatedly this old guy awaken in the middle of the night just to marry someone . . why would this happen ? Later , Emily drives home and torments this stroke victim named Helga ( Eugenie Leontovich ) by informing her of the evil deed she just committed . She's Helga's nurse and they have recently returned to the United States from Denmark with a man named Warren . Warren is to receive a multi-million dollar inheritance when he turns twenty-one . He has a sister Miriam ( Patricia Breslin ) who witnessed as a child the abuse Warren suffered from his father and then later from Helga . Helga , now , is mute and uses a wood-piece to communicate . She knows more than the viewer regarding Emily and her mysterious motives . We watch as Emily acts strangely , eyes full of hate , as she speaks to Miriam . . something about Miriam just enrages Emily to no end . Emily later , after leaving Miriam with Helga to get a prescription from the pharmacy , breaks into her flower shop destroying various wedding & floral decorations not to mention destroying Warren's photograph and picture frame . Meanwhile , the plainclothes police are out combing California for the murderer of the justice-of-peace and it's only a matter of time before Emily will have to finish whatever plan she has in store for others lying in her path . Miriam has a beau , Karl ( Glenn Corbett ) who works as a pharmacist and will assist police in finding the possible murderer when Emily fits the description . Another interesting twist in this bizarre tale , supposedly Emily is married to Warren who eventually shows up shocked that Miriam and Karl would even think his wife could commit such a violent act . But , there's a certain twist that comes right out of the blue Miriam certainly didn't see coming . . Seemingly inspired ( elements anyway ) by Hitchcock's PSYCHO , this flick tackles some themes such as sexual ( dis ) orientation and the after-effect of a traumatizing childhood due to abuse . Emily is the chess piece that holds all the answers to the film's ultimate mystery . . why is she so unhinged and what causes her to react so negatively towards Helga and Miriam ? Littered with clues in the screenplay , Castle succeeds at building this unique story that makes more sense as the twist emerges and all the pieces fall into place . Simply Castle's finest hour as director . The Fright Break is a hoot , but this film is brilliant without Castle having to resort to such measures at corralling viewers into theater seats .
436599	9938570	140384	9.0	Blind Beast	Aki ( Mako Midori ) is a famous model for an artist who frames her in all forms of sadomasochism such as being nude within tied ropes and buckled chains . A friend of that artist actually sculpted Aki's body with which , through gossip , beckons a blind sculptor to the gallery . Aki finds this man , Michio ( Eiji Funakoshi ) , fondling the statue with extreme delicacy , touching every part with passion and care . Later , Michio uses a false identity in getting a job as a masseuse so that he can get into Aki's apartment . As he massages her , Michio can not resist groping her private no-no areas and is told to leave . What Aki doesn't expect is Michio using a drug to knock her out as his mother assists in a kidnapping . Aki awakes inside Michio's own personal gallery where plaster casts of body parts , he has felt through various encounters with women , protrude from the walls creating a creepy surreal landscape . Aki tries desperately to escape , but the only door is locked and encased with iron . She will not be allowed to leave unless she poses for what he confirms will be his greatest sculpted work . . he wishes to feel her body inch for inch and sculpt it . Aki simply wishes to leave , but even when she almost escapes his clutches , Michio's mother ( Noriko Sengoku ) prevents her from fleeing . Seeing very few chances for freedom besides being his model , Aki will use manipulation , through sexual advances to virginal Michio ( while also tapping into the mother's obsessive love for her son , the only male she has had close contact with over the years ) to separate the son from his mother . Mother loathes Aki and sees her as nothing but a slutty harlot who uses her nakedness for greedy pay-off . Aki still just wishes to leave , but Michio slowly grows more and more obsessed with her pushing away the mother who has taken care of a blind child by herself for many , many years . The shattered relationship ends in a scuffle and tragedy as the mother tries to kill Aki with Michio interfering . The more notorious portion of the film is the last 30 minutes as Aki will be raped and sodomized by a vengeful , heartbroken Michio who realizes that his beloved model was merely deceiving him so that his relationship with mother would deteriorate offering her a possibility of escape . Not allowing Aki to leave , they slowly bond through animalistic , continual sex which descends more and more into sadomasochism and violent depravity . . or as Aki put it , " . . descent into a nonhuman abyss . " It starts through biting into each other's skin , grows into being tied up by rope and whipped , before descending into bruising and knife-stabbing . They even drink each other's blood from the knife-wounds . But , the magic of this disturbing tale is that director Yasuzo Masumura doesn't really show you anything much . . he uses the sounds of the objects hitting and penetrating the flesh creating the act in your own mind . Seeing somewhat normal people grow more and more mad ( Aki even goes blind ! ) through the pleasures of pain as they stretch the boundaries of what the human anatomy can take is the raw power of this film . The warehouse gallery is quite a bizarre , unusual , yet poetic setting for this groundbreaking masterwork .
436909	9938570	93777	9.0	Prince of Darkness	Father Loomis ( Donald Pleasence ) wishes for Prof . Howard Birack ( Victor Wong ) and his class ( . . along with some other students majoring in other scientific fields ) to use scientific data by way of technology and computers in deciphering what the ancient text written means guarding a mysterious green , circulating liquid inside a canister predating millions of years . The Brotherhood of Sleep was a secret sect of Catholic priests who guarded the canister also re-writing over the text during a many years so that it could not be understood by the outside world . Whatever is inside that canister , the Brotherhood wished it to stay there . Loomis only realized all of this once the elder priest guarding the room dies . What they discover is , I believe , that an anti-god ( the negative side of God ) roaming the earth was condemned to darkness while his son , Satan , was placed inside the canister . . that very canister containing the green liquid is he . Weird occurrences around the church begin surfacing such as derelicts surrounding the building watching in a gaze ( . . killing anyone that might exit the church ) and insects such as ants and worms collecting on windows amongst other things . Jesus Christ , the text announces , was an extra-terrestrial who tried to warn others but was killed . Jesus ' disciples were able to successfully cover it up by fabricating the truth using the false doctrine by what we read in the bible . Now Satan is growing powerful . . the canister is no longer able to hold him as the liquid splashes in the mouth of a student zombie-fying her . She subsequently " turns " other students into zombies by passing the liquid from her mouth to theirs . A small group remains , led by Brian and Catherine ( Jameson Parker & Lisa Blount ) along with Birack , Walter ( Dennis Dunn ) , & Loomis trying to find away out of the church when it seems that another student ( . . with a specific mark on the arm signifying her as the chosen vessel for the remaining liquid ) is chosen as the host for Satan himself ! It seems that there's no escape . Satan invades the chosen host like a parasite invading a foreign organism taking it over . To top all this , Satan wishes to free his master from the darkness ( . . using the mirror as an entrance into the world ) . A premonition " signal " is sent to many as they sleep verifying a certain event to take place traveling to them from light years in the future ! To be honest , the film is quite confusing and demanding , but also quite creepy and haunting . Who the figure is in the premonition is a powerful image that stays with you . The idea that the evil Prince of Darkness awaits the chance to enter our world condemning it is a scary aspect , but seeing our heroes trapped inside while demonic possessed humans await them outside and inside is just as frightening . The story is so convoluted , though , it's no wonder many don't care for it . The story regarding the evil our characters are up against and the dialogue ( scientific gibberish ) spoken by Birack & his students can be exhausting for those who can not understand it . But , the film has enough terrifying aspects , I believe , to retain interest . In my opinion , it's one of Carpenter's scariest , most effective horror films on his impressive resume . I'm guessing some may find the strong religious subject matter , heavy in the cryptic jargon between the characters , who also use scientific language frequently , might turn many away head-scratching . Hell , I'm not even sure my explanation of the synopsis is absolutely accurate . Probably a film many might return to over and over just to see if they can penetrate it further than the last time .
436443	9938570	98273	9.0	Sea of Love	Detective Frank Keller ( Al Pacino , in a perfect star vehicle ) is a middle-aged lonelyheart , recently divorced , whose ex is married to his partner . He begins thinking about his mortality as his 20 years of duty on the force has come up and longing for a female presence in his life has weighed on the mind . He's on a case regarding a swinger who was shot in the back of the head while listening to an oldie record 45 titled , " sea of Love " . A chance meeting with another detective from another precinct , Det . Sherman ( John Goodman in a terrific performance ) points to a possible string of killings as they find both their cases have the same MO . They decide to work together when they find that prints match from both of their cases and both males had put poems in the singles-ads . Frank wants to try this himself , with both he and Sherman believing the killer is a female with wrath towards ladies ' men as the motive . Keller , after going through several dates with many women who answer the ad ( . . which came from a poem Frank's mom wrote ) , begins a steamy love-affair with a sexy divorcée into kink . That female is Helen Cruger ( Ellen Barkin , heating the screen ) , and she has Frank feeling like a teenager . But , Frank begins questioning their relationship when he begins noticing little signs that may point to Helen possibly being the very killer he's investigating . This is true center of the story and a conflict plaguing Frank who is just head-over-heels for Helen . I must say this is one of my favorite Pacino performances because he wears weariness like a badge on his face . I felt Pacino plays him right showing a cop really damaged by a failed marriage and hitting the point in his life where he could retire from the force which brings up his age which torments him . Then this seductive gal comes along and throws him for a loop , rejuvenating him . I think Barkin is flat-out hot as the love-interest . I think she provides just the right amount of mystery that has us questioning her much like Frank eventually does . The film has a great dynamic between Pacino and Goodman which only makes it even better .
435679	9938570	224077	9.0	School of the Holy Beast	Boy , this sure doesn't hold back when casting a scathing view of the Catholic church . No stone is unturned . Everything is in this film . Duck for that kitchen sink because the hypocrisy and secrets hidden within the abbey of the church of nuns examined here is riddled with sin and deprivation . The kick is that , through Norifumi Suzuki's magnificent direction , this isn't just a cheapo exploit flick , but a legit art film . The film's protagonist , Maya , to me isn't very different that Nami , the Scorpion in the Female Prisoner film , except she infiltrates a dirty convent seeking answers regarding her mother's fate within the confines of what was supposed to be a religious community of believers . Where a dirty cop is behind the ills of Nami , a bitter priest , Father Kakinuma ( Fumio Watanabe ) is the man responsible for what ails Maya . The Priest and the Vice Abbess , a woman seething with lust running through very loins . The fact is this flick exposes the ugly truth of what could occur behind the closed walls of a hidden place secretively inactive from the outside world . Here's this modern girl , Maya ( the yummy Yumi Takigawa ) who we see enjoying the pleasantries of life before entering the repressed innards of a community harboring hidden immorality under a cloak of righteousness . She is the offspring of that very lust and sin that lies quietly buried underneath the cloak , and through her , will those iniquities be exposed . Though , when you threaten to expose hidden dirty old secrets , there are bound to be consequences . Her very life will be threatened by not only the Vice Abbess , but a " witch-finding nun " sent into the convent by Kakinuma to put an end to a thorn in his flesh which could finally awaken the monster he really is . Kakinuma is quite a character . . hidden underneath bushy long hair and thick mustache , not to mention this cloak which removes our eyes from a horrifying act that occurred from the past , is this menacing quiet beast who seems to be a loving man of God who any nun or God-fearing Christian could confide in when dealing with problems of the flesh , is , himself , holding rather unpleasant feelings toward everyone including the Lord he serves . He seeks answers from God ( " Where is God when man needs him ? " ) while constantly bedding nuns who revere him . What sins are hidden within this convent : lesbian lovers keeping their love-making secret from everyone , a Mother Superior who confiscates sex photos she masturbates to , nuns who enjoy the sight of women being whipped ( director Suzuki often pulls his camera in on their faces as they look on wide-eyed with enthusiasm ) , the persecution room ( readily used such as the case when Maya is being tortured with thorny vines twisting around her body , piercing her flesh as a nun on each side pulls with all their might ) , a nun who stole money from the Vice Abbess so that she could pay for her father's hospital bills for which she receives a rape from Kakinuma , etc . The torture scene where Maya is being treated to thorny rose vines is rather hard to watch as director Suzuki tightens the camera on how they slide back and forth underneath her breasts . But , what follows is actually both unpleasant and beautiful . . the nuns collectively slap Maya across the face with bouquets of roses as Suzuki shows her face whipping to and fro in slow motion as petals fall poetically like snow around her body . It's quite a feat to create such a scene which can alternately compel and repel . And , that whipping scene , the first one inside the infamous persecution room , is amazingly photographed as Suzuki's camera goes berserk following the action as the two nuns , caught by a spy , eating sausages . The most horrific sequence in the film , the witch-trial of a pregnant nun , who was raped by Kakinuma , is quite a dazzling moment in the film . We see her agonizingly put through the ringer , whipped with blood stripes opening on her skin , salt water poured in her mouth ( . . forced to swallow an entire pail ) , and held inside a chair as the clock ticks with this container under her legs ( with a gold crucifix at it's center ) ready for urine to flow . If she urinates , this poor soul will be condemned as a witch . Not just your run-of-the-mill nunsploit , although I'm not an expert in the subversive sub-genre , I'd be hard-pressed to expect another to be any better than this one . Lots of breasts exposed as well as unceasing stabs at Catholicism . . . there's a vehement anti-Catholic attitude that permeates throughout and use of Christian iconography ( the use of a crucifix to kill , the destruction of a Virgin Mary statuette , blood puddling down a portrait of THE LAST SUPPER ) in exploitive ways . Certainly not for all tastes . . some will find this film very offensive . Maya , an unshakable force to be reckoned with , will unleash her revenge on those responsible for her mother's demise .
435925	9938570	62885	9.0	The Devil Rides Out	Hammer studios scores a knock-out with this superb supernatural horror flick starring Christopher Lee as Duc de Richleau who finds a battle on his hands with a Satanic cult , led by Mocata ( Charles Gray ; played the villain Blofeld in DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER ) . Richleau had a war pal who died and so he took over fatherly duties for the man's son , Simon ( Patrick Mower ) , who is being pursued by the cult to become a follower of Satan . Richeau , a devout man who understands the methods of the dark magic , must stop them from taking Simon . Mocata has a powerful gift and that is of controlling weak minds . The key to the evil forces ' power is direct eye-contact . . you , in a sense , give over yourself when that form of contact is connected . Things get even more complicated when Richleau's other war pal , Rex ( Leon Greene ) finds that another has yet to have been " re-baptized " in the Satanic cult named Tanith ( Nike Arrighi ) for whom he falls in love . Mocata uses Tanith as his medium and can control her from a long distance . Tanith doesn't wish to harm anyone , but the evil commanding inside her is too strong to control . The Eatons have a home nearby where the Satanic cult hold a place of worship . Richard Eaton ( Paul Eddington ) thinks all that Richleau tells him is gibberish and is skeptical . His wife Marie ( Sarah Lawson ) is Richleau's niece and she does , albeit reluctantly , believe what her uncle speaks regarding the cult . But , it's only through action where Marie and Richard begin to understand what Richleau and they are up against . There are quite a few moments of peril for Richleau and Rex as they must somehow keep Simon and Tanith away from the clutches of Mocata and his group . It's proved in ritual that Mocata has the ability to summon Satan . If this flick were in anyone else's hands , it might turn out as a silly , campy horror film . But , in the capable hands of Terence Fisher with Lee leading the way FINALLY having an opportunity to be a heroic figure , this flick is played seriously with optimum effect . Charles Gray was well cast as the chief villain for he has a foreboding , yet sophisticated , presence that works well . At hindsight he might even look like a gentleman . . it's when he's able to practice his devil worship that we see his pure evil . Squeezing every ounce of tension at their disposal , our heroes will have to remain in a " circle of safety " as they are tempted to move out via fake manipulation showing them images that are not really there playing on the inner fear of each individual . Adding the final scary piece is when Mocata kidnaps the Eatons ' little girl for a sacrifice to their Lord .
435930	9938570	98360	9.0	Violent Cop	How apt the film's title really is ! A blood feud enrages when a detective and drug lord's assassin lock horns . Corruption is plaguing the police force as Azuma's ( Beat Yakeshi ) colleague , Iwaki ( Sei Hiraizumi ) , is helping deal drugs for a drug lord , Nito ( Ittoku Kishibe ) Nito's assassin , Kiyohiro ( Hakuryu ) is targeted by Azuma because Iwaki is found hanging from a bridge by his neck through a noose . Azuma soon frames him with planted drugs , locks him in a room at the police station where he batters the man , even almost putting a bullet in him . Losing his job as a cop , Azuma is attacked from behind by the assassin with a cat-and-mouse ensuing with the result being an obvious bloody showdown . Director Kitano's amazing debut certainly echoes Dirty Harry in Azuma's unorthodox methods of handing out justice . Except Kitano's detective often obtains information through beating those he interrogates senseless . Usually , though , the ones he smacks around deserve a bit of punishment for their thuggish behavior & criminal activities . In one scene , Iwaki is trying to smooth things over between a gigolo and a girl he got pregnant ( . . for whom he also physically abuses ) . . in typical Azuma fashion , the detective beats the gigolo up right in the hallway of the police precinct ! One of my favorite scenes concerns a drug pusher with info Azuma needs regarding who he's selling dope for , in the bathroom of a discotheque . . Azuma continues to repeatedly slap this joker until the guy finally cracks revealing the drug lord as a restaurateur named Nito . What I found most fascinating was just how the assassin Kiyohiro and Azuma are similar . They are actually , in my opinion , cut from the same cloth , just on opposing sides of the law . Both carry themselves without fear of what lies in front of them . . with a cold , steely expression , the two exact punishment to those that oppose them . One , Azuma , uses violent methods to extract the information he needs or to put a person in their place . The killer , Kiyohiro , dutifully removes the thorns from his employer's side . Neither flinches when facing an obstacle or opponent and will hurt you bad if need be . But , both men have a hair trigger and are easily willing to wipe somebody out . It's appropriate that the cop will lose his job and go vigilante as it seems both he and the assassin are fated to meet in a gunfight to the death . Almost like the OK Coral is the vehicle lot where these two stare down each other before the shooting begins . The film has moments of startling violence interspersed with subtle humorous touches of Azuma and his faithfully law-abiding , naive partner , Kikuchi ( Makoto Ashikawa ) . Kikuchi , appears anyway , to be very by-the-book , patiently dealing with his often unhinged partner who can uncork at any moment stomping a suspect or insider who knows something of importance regarding their case . One particularly breathtaking sequence involves the chase of a criminal with information on drugs running throughout the city , after bashing and killing a police officer over the head with a baseball bat . Azuma , unflinchingly , runs him over with the car he's driving ! If you are familiar with Beat's characters in films , his cop is the same . A stone face hiding the obvious emotions present inside , unshakably like an impenetrable rock , his cop uses blunt force to speak for him . Sure a smile cracks every once in a while , mostly at his partner's ways , but Azuma buries most of what other cops wear on their sleeve . There's a scene I found amusing where Azuma is told he's fired as the detective stares down his chief without batting an eyelash with the camera lingering on him seemingly forever . The opening of the film really sets the tone for how our " hero " works as a police officer . . a group of mean kids harm a beggar on a street corner minding his own business . Azuma follows one of them to his home . He invites himself in to the kid's house to his mom's bewilderment . And , Azuma subsequently smacks the kid around telling the brat to turn himself in ! Something I also found amusing was how Azuma almost always walks . . everywhere , it seems , in this film he's trotting to this or that destination on foot . The film also shows another problem Azuma has to deal with . . a mentally retarded sister who doesn't turn away from men wanting sex , and we see what her brother does to one fellow who took advantage of her , getting thrown down the steps , his body pouring into the street as Azuma slaps the back of his head , kicking his shin as both men walk to a bus stop . When Kiyohiro kidnaps her , getting the poor girl hooked on heroine , Azuma's decision regarding her need for a fix is truly haunting . Like most of Kitano's future characters , whose lives revolve around crime , his violent cop here is a doomed character fated for only one certain outcome . Also , this film cleverly shows that even if one major crime lord is removed by deadly means , there's always another waiting to take his position . . and that goes for corrupt cops as well .
436413	9938570	58283	9.0	The Scarecrow reviews " Lady in a Cage "	Olivia de Havilland ( in a performance that could've easily been hammy , but instead is completely true and heartbreaking ) portrays Cornelia Hilyard , a widow with a bad hip who uses an elevator to move from one floor to another . On one unfortunate day , her son leaves for a few days ( there is a sad angle to his life that we see in little increments as mother does little overbearing things which etch subtly on William Swan's Malcolm's face ) , and during an accidental power failure , Cornelia is trapped in her elevator and her alarm bell doesn't seem to attract anyone for assistance . Her constant bell ringing does bring one visitor , unfortunate for Cornelia it is a wino played by Jeff Corey who seeks a relationship with Ann Sothern's ( who is very good ) Sade , a hustler . The wino escapes Cornelia's home with a toaster for a quick sell at a pawn shop where the sadistic pack of wolves led by an evil James Caan ( who is simply brilliant in an inspired method performance ) as Randall Simpson O'Connell notice him . They see possible riches so they follow the wino ( who has enlisted the aid of Sade ) to Cornelia's home . From this point on , we must watch in horror as Cornelia dangles in this contraption while Caan and his gang terrorize Sade and the wino while mocking her . . and taking her possessions from the house . They decide to it might be wise to kill the wino and Sade , not to mention ending the life of Cornelia . Cornelia , however , has tricks up her sleeve . Seeing Caan harassing de Havilland I feel is the most powerful part of this film . . that and the unfortunate tragedy of Cornelia's son who can not accept his mother's overbearing ways { there is also perhaps hints of incest which might even broaden the the tragedy of the entire film } . The film has us in an unpleasant position . . we are on-lookers to a poor woman's fate for she has nowhere to go and is almost at the mercy of heathens who have this nihilism that is unpleasant . The film itself is so uncompromising I found myself surprised at how early it was made . 1964 ( or perhaps even 1960 ) was perhaps an example of how films would begin to leave the normalcy and comfort of feeding audiences only happy subjects and endings when the world was anything but . Caan and his bunch are a representation of the youth culture abandoned by society . . perhaps that's why the rage and hostility towards the older sect comes from . Caan's Randall informs Cornelia he's been in reform schools and institutions since he was 9 . One can perhaps see why he's so willing to smash and maim . . there's such pain there that can only surface through volatile means . Cornelia is a victim not only of health and age , but because of her wealth . That wealth only fuels Randall's will . The film , I believe , is a masterwork that was way before it's time . It has not aged at all .
436893	9938570	456630	9.0	Reincarnation	" We'll stay together forever . " College Professor , Kazuya Omori ( Shun Oguri ) claims the lives of eleven victims ( including his wife , son & daughter ) before committing suicide in a hotel in 1970 , the 45th day of Showa . Movie director Ikuo Matsumura ( Kippei Shiina ) is motivated to create a portrait which focuses on the lives of the victims , shying away from the murderer . In a sense , his screenplay , " Memories " fashioned from memoirs and items involving those unfortunate victims whose fates were sealed on that day , is a testament or way of honoring them . Actress Nagisa Sugiura ( Yûka ) is selected to portray the little girl who was killed by her father , Omori and as soon as the script is delivered to her , strange occurrences plague her . She sees memories of that horrifying day , often reliving them as if drawn into that specific time . A college student , Yayoi Kinoshita ( Karina ) is having dreams of a specific hotel , and in her pursuit for that location , realizes it is the hotel where the eleven murders took place . Are these specific events related or mere coincidence ? We watch as the film dedicated to the victims is recreated with poor Nagisa experiencing more and more horrifying occurrences . Both Nagisa and Yayoi will discover terrifying truths about why they experience these visions . . they do correlate with that hotel and we watch in disturbing detail as those events from 1970 unfold . I think both " Ju-on : The Grudge " & " Marebito " were stepping stones to reach Takashi Shimizu's masterpiece , " Rinne / Reincarnation " . He takes " cryptomnesia phenomenon " ( . . or the idea of a " past life " , viewed as a symptom ) and spins it as an unpleasant horror tale where those who are the proponents ( " the human body is just a vessel " ) of this are stuck with having to carry the burden of reliving the same grim fates of their predecessors . The significance of the little boy's red ball , the little girl's eerie doll , and even the Professor's 8 mm video-recorder all are distinct images that Shimizu uses to optimum effect . In an amazing feat , Shimizu runs three different events occurring at the same time simultaneously , depicting the calculated events of Omori and those he killed in one sequential span of screen time . . Nagisa running through a crucial scene for Matsumura , Yayoi finding the hotel she's been searching for and discovering more than she could ever want to know , and Omori's video-recorded carnage viewed by Nagisa's agent ( after an incident Nagisa ' relived in her dream , she found Omori's video-camera in her bed ! ) . The final closing minutes as Nagisa discovers whose reincarnated spirit represents her and those who seek after her is quite unsettling and haunting . Actually the whole movie is quite wicked and disturbing . This was an amazing experience . . more horror films should be this smart and gripping . This film doesn't hold back on child violence , either , as we see what Omori actually does to his son and daughter with a large knife .
435786	9938570	69390	9.0	All the Colors of the Dark	Unrelenting suspensor about a woman so tormented by her nightmares ( after losing a child stillborn when her boyfriend Richard hit a tree ) , she's willing to try anything including black mass ritual performed by a Satanic cult introduced to her by a neighbor , Mary . Her sister , Barbara has tried to get her psychiatric help from Dr . Gordon , but Richard sees this as a silly waste of time . Jane's trauma is so disorienting , she believes a psychopath has emerged from her nightmares and manifested himself into reality . Shades of " Rosemary's Baby " is obviously present throughout the film particularly the photography of the black mass rituals , but they are none the less chilling to watch . I think what worked so well for me was the idea of this poor , frightened woman not be able to separate herself from this demented stalker with blue , piercing eyes . The film's location plays greatly into the style of the piece , but Martino's surreal lens really creates this foreboding that gets under the skin as characters { the Satanic High Priest , especially } literally grab toward the viewer . The camera loves to slide up and down Fenech's wonderfully silky body { one of the best scenes in the film is a steamy shower shot up her body as she wets herself with only a shirt on } , but it's her performance as the paranoid , nearly crazed Jane that really sells this film . Hilton is good enough given very limited screen time .
435709	9938570	101276	10.0	Afraid of the Dark	A young boy , Lucas ( stunning , haunting performance from young Ben Keyworth ) who is slowly going blind , dreams up a horrifying nightmare about a serial slasher of blind women nearby his London home ( . . with a graveyard located outside his window , no less ) . It seems to take shape when he places his thick-lensed glasses on which might mean that the impending surgery of his eyes has created such a subconscious fear it has taken shape in reality . A poor dog , Toby , becomes a victims of this . Those in reality , Tom Miller , a locksmith ( David Thewlis ) , a window washer , and photographer Tony ( Paul McGann ) all seem to become foreboding possible killers in the horrifying fantasy . Lucas ' step-dad Frank ( James Fox ) , in reality a florist , is a cop on the case of the slashings of the blind women in his nightmare . Mother Miriam ( Fanny Ardant ) is pregnant in reality with perfect sight ( . . who says she would rather be the one going blind rather than her son ) but blind in the nightmare which has the young lass worried for her safety . . and later the child after it's born , although the film paints the possible picture he'd rather harm the infant than keep it safe . Rose ( the beautiful , fine-figured Clare Holman ) is Frank's daughter in reality on the verge of marriage with Tony , but in the nightmare also blind , married to someone else blind , who is possibly threatened by Tony , anything but the person in real-life . In the nightmare we follow the boy as he canvases the area around where the serial slasher might frequent , but watch his unusual , cold manner about things . . he's an observer who seems almost unphased at the terror occurring around him . His voyeuristic activities has him seeing people from a different perspective because . . and this is the powerful aspect in the nightmare I think . . most are blind except Frank , the policeman , an ice-cream vendor who lusts after Miriam , the locksmith , window washer & photographer . So obviously he sees what the innocents do not . . how certain people truly are . In the reality , we also see a cut-away Lucas who seems like Waldo amongst a group of people existing as if he's not there . I don't think he is for the most part . . his on-coming blindness and the pregnancy about to take place take shape over everything else . The surgery is also the main event that truly terrifies him . . the doctor who will have the knife is a scary blind hobo in Lucas ' nightmare ( one of his eyes has an albino white tint for extra ominous effect ) . I'm afraid this flick will be frustrating to many who might not attach to the lead character who can be quite creepy , and detached , for most viewers . I saw this as an interesting approach seeing him as a young boy struck with fear losing his sight , both mentally and physically . I think this film goes into some dark psychological places . . treads onto that territory of fear using blindness and impending blindness as catalysts to tell the dark tale . The slasher , the glasses and what they see when Lucas puts them on and removes them , and the knitting needle which seems to be his weapon of protection . . all seem to represent symbolic images of the blindness he fears of .
436839	9938570	66516	10.0	Valerie and Her Week of Wonders	You know I looked at director Jaromil Jires's film from a different perspective , hoping to perhaps take an " outside the box " view regarding the bewildering madness which continues for 80 minutes . I felt that Valerie's situation was a thirteen year old , blossoming with curiosity about sex , in a sexually repressed , deeply religious peasant village . Her one escape is the fantasy world of dreams / nightmares which unlock all the inner wonders and feelings brimming inside the young virgin , just having her first experience of adulthood through a period . Missing parents , a grandmother with worsening health , a theatrical troupe passing through , servant girls who blissfully enact in sexual pleasures with the village hunk , and a priest with his army of nuns . A vampire ( . . who could possibly be her father ) who desires Valerie , a " brother " named Eagle ( . . an " assistant of the vampire who goes against his master's wishes when he returns magical ear rings to Valerie he had swiped while she slept ) who always saves her , a younger form of her " granny " who is sexually driven and always a threat to her existence , and other countless characters drift in and out of the dream for the film's duration . . these characters could very well represent troublesome realities that awaken in metaphorical forms , both hostile and serene . At any event , this dream / nightmare is Valerie's terrain , and , no matter what " predator " threatens to either harm or threaten her sexually or by any other means , she is always given passage to escape . Again , this is also her terrain and Valerie is the central motivating character that everyone covets or desires . At one point or another , those main characters she confronts , from Eagle to her youthful granny , make an attempt to ravage her . Another interesting aspect I noticed was the gloomy marriage of a peasant girl to a much older , wealthy farmer . . perhaps this is another sad reality plaguing Valerie for I'm never sure , myself to be honest , if what we ever see ventures into reality ( . . that's what I love most about this film : the idea of not knowing if anything we see is actually real or all concocted through the dreams of a young or old woman looking back at what she would've desired and never ultimately received ) . Through the lens of director Jires , Jaroslava Schallerová as the heroine of the film , is shot seductively . A mere thirteen years old , Schallerová has an angelic beauty that is evocatively photographed . . I felt it was crucial to this film's success that she have an innocence and purity that would off-set the sin and danger all around her , threatening to corrupt what she has . Jaroslava Schallerová spends a good portion of the film in flowing gowns with the arm straps dropping to expose her tiny developing breasts . . I found this a bit alarming and daring considering the fact that she is still a girl , but artistically we must be aware of what others desire and covet . If she were an ugly duckling ( . . which she very well could be in reality , but this is Valerie's fantasy so she's pretty and creates yearning from those in her dreamlike world ) no one would bother her . But , this is Valerie's dream and she is at the forefront of every action that takes place in this film . That's about all I got folks , because what we see for 80 minutes sure had a grip on me . Overflowing with one incredibly bizarre sequence after another , I felt entranced by what this fantasy delivers visually . Cobwebs , chickens , vampires ( . . especially the very dead looking " Weasel " with his black cape always wrapping around someone as if shrouding them from Valerie's sight ) . . ugliness and beauty often intertwined and separated in Valerie's unique world . Jire's film in unbridled , flooding you and me with remarkable visions , both macabre and stunning . I will say , though , that this film's often sensual depiction of Jaroslava Schallerová might be off-putting to many . An amazing experience I plan to enjoy again in the near future . It's nearly impossible to grasp everything in one single sitting .
435860	9938570	353969	10.0	Memories of Murder	Two rural detectives , their chief & a well-educated Seoul detective search for a serial killer who specifically chooses certain victims when it rains , using their own undergarments to bound and strangle them while he rapes their tied up bodies . We watch as the rural detectives , who often use rough tactics to secure their admittance of guilt from those they question , try to find the killer and how the effected the city detective is when attempts to catch him often fail . We see their dogged , weary pursuit of suspects and the exhaustive , emotional let-down when each is ruled out by one way or another . When a possible suspect emerges , and seems the ideal candidate fitting the profile of the rapist who nearly murdered one living victim ( . . and also requested a specific song only on the nights the murders took place , not to mention the fact that he started working at a factory right before the murders ) , they believe that their misery might finally end as they await a DNA semen report from America possibly pinpointing him as the murderer . But , is this suspect the murderer , and better yet , can the rural detectives keep from exploding in anger when they interrogate the suspect ? It'll all come to a head when the city detective looses his suspect after falling asleep on his watch and yet another young woman is horribly butchered in a much more heinous manner during one of the town's common blackouts . . the detective will take his suspect to an isolated location claiming him guilty even though the American lab results may say otherwise . Powerful , haunting , gut-wrenching , & heartbreaking . . we see how these men fail at their methods despite giving their heart and souls to the case day after day . Developed obsessions with possibly suspects even have the detectives at each others ' throats . The film is quite absorbing as we see how each detective loses a bit of their humanity as they cripple at the leads that fail them or at an eyewitness who perishes accidentally during a horrible train accident . The Korean leads all bring much to their roles . . during the film each character is fleshed out and exposed of their flaws at trying desperately to catch a killer against many odds such as unavailable forensic techniques or civilians trampling over crime scenes . Beautifully crafted by director Joon-ho Bong who adds many humorous bits sprinkled throughout so that the achingly tragic story will not be such a burden to sit through . Bong respects the victims by not dwelling on the murdered bodies too long .
436235	9938570	64904	10.0	Hatchet for the Honeymoon	A handsome sociopath named John Harrington ( Stephen Forsyth , perfectly cast ) , stuck in a bad marriage with a wife who holds her fortune over his head like a badge of honor , enjoys murdering females before they wed .

Only adding to that is the fact that he operates a wedding boutique founded by the mother he adored . . John has the provided extra motivation to slay . Disturbed by this calling of his name , after each kill John gets closer to seeing the face of she who haunts him . Does he really want to see this , though ? Using a hatchet as his weapon of slaughter , John incinerates the bodies in his flower hot-house . His wife's vicious overbearingness only presses the madness underneath his calm exterior . An inspector ( Jesús Puente ) , on the case to find who is killing all the brides-to-be , hounds John passing off little verbal jabs poking about the idea that he's a prime suspect . To add to John's paranoia is the ghost of the wife he kills and buries in the hot-house flower garden . It seems her presence looms over him like a shadow and she associates ( . . and is seen ) by those around John . He's also " visited " by a young boy devastated by the sight of his mother collapsing after someone attacked her . We ought to know who that boy is and the fact that this visual horror might've lent a hand in John's descent into killing . Bava's a master at creating lucid nightmares and images that haunt and remain with you . There's a scene every Hitchcock fan would love after John kills his wife . After completing this task , before he could take her body from top of the stairs the inspector comes knocking at his door . The missus's dead arm is dripping blood on the carpet below as John tries to work his nemesis out of the room . And , how he evades the question about hearing a woman screaming from the inspector is also very ingenious . Bava also lenses a fascinating sequence with John alone as he caresses his mannequins . They are lifeless , but he doesn't seem to care . . John holds them with this kind of deep cherish relishing the silence that exudes from within the room . Also , the way Bava photographs the hatchet as if providing a lustful allure . . it's as if the camera embraces this weapon of execution . I mean just watch how John holds the hatchet in his hand . . it's like holding the woman you love . Lastly , Bava's decision to have us be a part of John's madness and despair is another important creepy part that makes this whole film quite an experience . This is an amazing piece of film-making . . a truly bizarre masterwork of genius .
436534	9938570	60668	10.0	Marat / Sade	The Persecution and Assassination of Jean-Paul Marat as Performed by the Inmates of the Asylum at Charenton Under the Direction of the Marquis de Sade . The title pretty much sums up this powerfully visualized " play " , set in 1808 , during France's supposed success rate at educating the insane . This play by de Sade which is a scathing dissection of the French Revolution using Marat as the voice for the war as the Marquis takes the role against it . Morality obviously being this is a play from Marquis de Sade is also under the microscope as those that are insane fulfill certain roles under the celebrated masochist's direction . Monsieur Coulmier ( Clifford Rose ) is the mediator watching de Sade's behavior regarding what his script can and can not say . Blasphemy in this supposed golden age of France can not be warranted so Coulmier , with the assistance of nuns and guards inside , try to keep the deranged - - and de Sade - - in check . The play itself is told through not only the characters written on page , but from the insane themselves who often intervene on their own behalf . The ending is a fine slap in the face of the so-called success the French asylums seemed to have employed as the maniacs , after finishing , attack all the normal folk inside ( two aristocratic women are audience members inside the cell - - what were they thinking ? ) as Marquis relishes the chaos with glee . The staged film is disturbing , bleak , but profound and spellbinding . The way the camera moves throughout the cell ( and several shots through the bars and on the darkened audience outside the cell ) is hypnotic and deeply luridly fascinating . The cast is so good , they really convinced me I was watching a directed play using loonies !
436525	9938570	73582	10.0	Deep Red	A vicious stabbing silhouetted on a wall , the bloody butcher knife thrown to the floor , an unsettling children's tune chanting away on a record player , and a pair of children's legs walking onto the scene of the crime . . Argento masterly introduces us to the central event where all the other events that come after contribute to . A psychic announces at a parapsychology session in a theater that she senses the volatile thoughts and feelings of deeply disturbed person . This person leaves the theater , with Argento shooting from POV as he rushes to get away . We know exactly what she " sees " because we were witnesses , slightly , ourselves to the grisly murder of someone not yet determined . Later this psychic is brutally murdered by a psycho in a raincoat with a hatchet . From the street below her apartment , a pianist / professor , Marcus Daly ( David Hemmings ) sees her face slammed through her window thanks to the harsh blow of the hatchet to the back of her head . Briskly moving to her apartment , he finds her hanging over a broken piece of window glass dead . Something irks him , an image he believes was a painting , that he feels is a vital clue in discovering the killer . Morbidly curious as to why this psychic was killed , Marcus decides to pursue the psycho's identity not only putting his own life in danger but other innocents as well . . his pursuit will undoubtedly lead to the murders of those who might find out who the killer is . A house with a hidden room holding a secret , a drawing of a bloody stabbing , a book containing the photo of the specific house , a writing on a bathtub as steam provides a nearly-dead victim a chance to identify a certain fact important to finding the killer all assist Marcus in his pursuit . But , his pursuit gets others inadvertently killed because someone is truly motivated to keep a secret that has remained buried for quite a long time . A woman is stabbed with her face immersed in boiling bathtub water . Another victim gets a knife plunged into his neck . And , an important victim , whose forced into perhaps killing Marcus so that the killer's identity would remain unknown , is dragged by a truck , his head hammering into a concrete sidewalk , before being crushed under another car's tire . A supporting character , Carlo ( Gabriele Lavia ) , Marcus ' boozing , depressed , troubled , homosexual pal , has a major role in the film , as does his unflappable mother . Argento builds the mystery by uncovering each layer , one step at a time , with consequences for those who find out too much . A variety of camera techniques , a throbbing , groovy rock score from Goblin , good chemistry between Hemmings ( . . much more likable and endearing than his rather soulless artist in Antonioni's Blow-up ) and Daria Nicolodi ( . . as sassy , sexy , and tough-talking liberal reporter Gianni ) , and some spellbinding set-pieces ( . . especially when Marcus is inside the infamous , deteriorating mansion which is a shadow of it's once palatial state , just teeming with spooky atmosphere ) really make this a winning giallo thriller . Some fantastic sequences include the discovery of a corpse , Hemmings face reflected from a pool of blood , and an eyeball isolated in the darkness of a closet . I watched a rather inferior , lower quality transfer in pan'n'scan format , and highly recommend seeking out the wide-screen version instead . Deep Red should be seen in the proper way , where Argento's work can most appreciated . Probably Argento's most intricately plotted , delicately structured film to date .
436557	9938570	67361	10.0	Lizard in a Woman's Skin	Lucio Fulci's " Schizoid " pulls you in so many directions you know you are watch a filmmaker at his finest point of his career . While I feel other later films were shoddily plotted and illogically unbalanced , this film is right on the mark in every moment . It takes a unique premise using dream logic , the mind's subconscious , blackmail , adultery , lesbianism , and a murder of a hippie socialite and Fulci weaves a web of unpredictability any giallo or horror fan would dream of . The film opens with a dream from Carol Hammond ( Florinda Bolkan ) concerning her delirious trip through an orgy of naked people standing trying to flee but finding herself in the arms of a woman ( the always luscious Anita Strindberg ) . As she tells this to her psychoanalyst , Carol seems to be ridding herself of buried desires in an attempt to " free " herself from the bondage of depravity . But , one such dream shows Carol murdering the woman and it turns out that this occurrence actually happens to the very next door neighbor for whom she speaks of . Soon Carol is the main suspect when the police and detectives find her fingerprints all over the weapon used ( . . not to mention , her fur was by the dead woman's bed ) . Little elements emerge , however , that might save Carol such as these notes she took moments after her awakening from the dreams . Another development shows that her husband Frank ( Jean Sorel ) had access to her notes , understood a point of entrance into the dead woman's pad , could place certain things in the dead woman's room that belong to Carol , and had a motive for seeing his wife put away for murder . . he was having a two year passionate love affair with another woman . Another major development has two possible witnesses at the scene of the crime , one of whom actually chases Carol twice in attempt to kill her with a knife ( in one inspired sequence , Carol raises the ire of a nest of bats in an organ loft as she hid from the one chasing her ) . Is or is not Carol the killer . . that is the main question at the heart of this marvelously deranged , colorful , and thoughtfully designed giallo . I'm a big fan of the use of dream logic and what lies within the human mind as it pertains to a murder mystery . Loving Hitchcock's " Spellbound " about an amnesiac trying to unlock key memories that will answer a puzzling mystery , Fulci uses the same general idea regarding dream logic but moving it in a bizarre , lurid direction . This great movie yields one surprise after another as so many possibilities seem to unfold from what felt like a forgone conclusion . Thanks to Fulci and his collaborators , this film will shock you right up until the end . In my opinion , Fulci's finest film .
436304	9938570	185937	10.0	The Blair Witch Project	" We are going to die out here . " Hard to believe it's been practically a decade since " The Blair Witch Project " was all the buzz , revolting some with how it would not give in allowing us to see what is terrorizing these three unfortunate would-be documentarian filmmakers , causing some audience-goers to almost up-chuck at the dizzying , skakey camera work ( . . but , if you think about it , this only gives this piece merit , these are amateur filmmakers who have yet to truly master the right form of precise camera-movement ) , and leaving many furiously duped at how producers claimed it was real , that footage of vanished film students had been found and pieced together for our benefit . Watching it for the first time since , hell , 2000 I guess , I was surprised at how this gave me the creeps . It was as if I were with them , deep into the woods lost , the sinister trappings of wilderness imprisoning me . I envisioned just what it would be like , there in that tent hearing noises out in the distance , even those giggly sounds of children brought chills up and down my spine . . particularly when you see and hear the slight pounding on the exterior of the tent . I mean , snapping twigs and sticks out in the darkness actually gave me the willies . At first , I could understand how three film students , Heather , Josh , & Michael would find their little adventure such a thrill . . it was like a vacation with the goal of capturing a documentary for an extra grade in school lifting their average of say to possibly a This documentary , as seen early on , seems to be little more than to photograph and convey the legend of some Witch who supposedly haunts the woods . It's treated with rolled eyes as locals share what they know second-hand about it , providing our students with fuel for later laughter . I enjoyed how , as this continues , the camaraderie deteriorates eventually leading to shouting matches and ridicule . I found this actually rather believable and realistic , it worked for me . I could see a couple of people I either barely know , or know just from reputation , getting lost with yours truly as the guide with these sort of reactionary emotions and situations happening . These are just people with everyday jobs hoping for brighter futures facing unforeseen horrors which spiral out of their control despite the fact that getting lost in the woods in our modern age shouldn't happen . Is it some mythical witch behind the spooky noises and unusually shaped rocks and stick-men ? The film sure paints a picture of this in the final moments as Heather and Michael enter an eerie dilapidated house with children's hand-prints and ritualistic symbols inscribed on the walls as Josh cries for their help . The basement with a person standing with their face to the wall as a camera falls helpless to the ground after a hard thud sure opens up the scary idea that something truly disturbing was happening away from the camera . I like not knowing because I could just imagine the horrors taking place as if it were me being treated to a rude awakening that far from the civilization I know lies in the heart of the wilderness evil has freedom over those unlucky enough to enter it's domain . I know that a lot of f-king people hate this with an absolute passion , but this sure worked for me . . I mean just think about it for a minute : lost in the woods , sounds and voices in the distance , you have heard about a supposed witch haunting the woods , one amongst your party is kidnapped with his agony just out of reach echoing the wilderness , and rocks ( . . not to mention something bloody wrapped in a napkin , neatly intertwined within sticks , cloth & string ) formed in a specific manner warning you that you are not alone . It sure would have me peeing in my pants .
436533	9938570	79813	10.0	Gabba Gabba Hey	Fascist principal Miss Togar ( Mary Woronov , who is lensed by expert photographer Dean Cundy as if she were ten feet tall ) has a plan to turn her high completely square . Complications ensue which challenge that goal in delightful rock'n'roller Riff Randell ( PJ Soles who lights up the screen - - she's got a hot bod , too ) who is an obsessive fan of the punk band THE RAMONES . Pal Kate Rambeau ( Dey Young , whose big rimmed glasses and nerdy role can not hide her stunning beauty ) joins forces with Riff to put an end to the supposed crisis of killing rock'n'roll for good which is Togar's desired mission . Vincent Van Patten has a hilarious role as Tom Roberts , a success at everything , but getting laid . Kate is crazy about Tom . . if only he could pull his head out of the sand and see it . Clint Howard steals the film almost ( honestly , who can steal this film away from Soles ? ) as Eaglebauer , " the supplier " who can get everyone almost anything . His office is located in the boy's restroom ! Paul Bartel is also hilarious as a music teacher who becomes an ally of Riff's when he enjoys a concert of THE RAMONES . A raucous high school romp that defies all rules of normalcy . . and I loved it . It's like someone just says , " Let's make life fun for 1 ½ hours . " The film really is anarchy . . a plot-less chaos lovingly adoring THE RAMONES with all it's heart ( even if they are horrible actors , they have an opportunity to gain new audiences with this film ) . The ending pretty much sums up the film as a whole . . Riff and her classmates take over the high school and one massive party begins . To be honest , I didn't want the party to end ! Not conventional in any way whatsoever , this film just let's loose a frenzy . Accompanied by a great rock soundtrack featuring some of THE RAMONES best songs , this film allows a viewer to accept a time in life when war didn't dominate headlines and people just had a good time . Those , I guess were the days .
