436414	9938570	120458	1.0	The Scarecrow reviews " Virus "	Dreadful sci-fi / horror hybrid based on a comic book about an alien force which electrifies a Russian space station which in turn links to a Russian scientific research vessel down on the ocean of earth . A tug boat helmed by nut-case captain Sutherland ( in one of the worst performances of his career , battling an Irish accent and really lacking any presence whatsoever ) , with crew-members Curtis , Baldwyn , & the " ready - to - be - slaughtered - prime - time - players " suffer a cataclysmic leak on their boat after they try to pull a barge during a typhoon . They come across the Russian ship which seems to be deserted and ram-sacked and decide to salvage it with dollar signs glistening in their eyes for a big payday . The ship's power source is cut off and they do not not know what lies in wait once they re-power it . This film has nothing new to offer as characters are merely on script to be killed , completely lifeless and stupid . The alien force seems to operate anything mechanical and little robotic spiders and giant machine monsters run amok doing victims in . Curtis is too damn good in this film and it does not deserve her talents . Baldwyn does what he can with an underwritten hero simply written in the film to save people . . he doesn't even get to crack wise . Pacula portrays the only Russian survivor who tries to warn them of what they are up against . The film seems to be about explosions and more explosions . The evil electrical alien force doesn't even get much story . . it's simply in the film to kill , nothing more & nothing less . The force , for some reason , also assembles robots together using human remains along with wires and steel . Terrible mess which just gets worse and worse as it goes along .
435958	9938570	372832	2.0	Skeleton Man	A Delta Force Army unit , assigned to find a batch of missing Green Beret bad-asses not known for going completely missing , will be in a fight for survival against a cloaked skeleton man , the supposed spirit of an ancient Indian warrior who was revived when archaeologists disturbed his grave . The Skeleton Man rides a horse and has the ability to propel to and fro using a type of dimensional portal , and seems unaffected by bullet-fire and explosives . The Skeleton Man's horse leaves no hoof prints and he can ride from behind and around his prey silently . The film's point-of-view through the Skeleton Man's eyes looks at his prey with a different color . In other words , he's not seemingly human , so how can Captain Leary ( Michael Rooker , as grizzled and intense as ever ) and his gang of would-be commandos stop this menace ? For some reason , the Skeleton Man murders employees of a nearby chemical plant . What are the Skeleton Man's motives for slaughtering endless human beings ? And , why is a blind Indian living in the forest our commandos inhabit spared if the Skeleton Man , as a human , slaughtered his entire tribe to prove himself ? As completely stupid as it sounds . Just unbelievable horrible . This is the kind of film that can deaden brain cells . Casper Van Dien gets second billing in the credits just under Rooker , yet is saddled with a ridiculously underwritten character who exits the film quite early . Rooker deserves better than this . If I were an actor , I wouldn't want this movie in my resume . The Skeleton Man is a reject Templer Knight from a de Ossorio film . He has a spear which can merely knock certain people down while exploding the head of a woman on impact . An arrow shot from the Skeleton Man's bow actually destroys the propeller of a chopper plane . For nearly 99 % of the film , bullets are shot at the Skeleton Man and he can go in and out of that portal thingee yet , at the end , all of a sudden , he becomes vulnerable to attack . Oh , and the horses also change as the Skeleton Man freely moves through the forest from that portal . The film is written and edited by clowns . The attack scenes are poorly constructed and the characters , who are supposed to be experienced pros , make really bad decisions throughout this film . The mind boggles with this film . Good for some laughs , and some gore scenes make this hunk of pure crap watchable as a trash movie .
436675	9938570	85224	2.0	The Being	One eyed blob monster , a product of the usual toxic waste dumping ( . . as mayor José Ferrer put it so adequately , Pottsville was chosen by Industrial governmental scientist Martin Landau as " the most sophisticated dump site in the country . " ) , with slobbery sharp teeth and terribly sensitive to light , attack the locals by wrapping it's lizard tongue around their throats , whisking them out of the camera frame . Sheriff Bill Osco , who dresses like a truck driver , even when at the town station , is to the rescue , ready to kill the monster if he doesn't bore him to death first with his non-performance and monotone voice . The blob monster could very well be the son of a haggard Dorothy Malone . Meanwhile Mayor Ferrer's wife Ruth Buzzi is having Easter egg hunts with the children , holding rallies against the new massage parlor coming to town supposedly advocating an arrival of filth to the community , and holding an opera within her home for a gathering of town folk . Marianne Gordon , who seems to escape the embarrassment in a low-key performance as a waitress and possible love-interest to Osco ( . . why she'd even be interested in someone as lively as a block of wood is anyone's guess ) , will be the woman in peril who would eventually walk Malone home and never be seen in the film again . Now , to take a moment to talk about Landau . I think we can use " The Being " as an educational tool on how a prominent actor , at the very bottom of his career starring in this cinematic equivalent of a toilet bowl with fresh smelly turds , can rise from the ashes like a Phoenix thanks to two directors , Woody Allen ( . . in probably the finest performance of his career , " Crimes and Misdemeanors " ) & Tim Burton ( " Ed Wood " ) . I actually think Ferrer , last seen in this film driving off , quite wasted and frightened after seeing the blob monster , plays his role a bit tongue-in-cheek as a constantly annoyed Mayor who just wants to grow his potatoes and make his little town a wealthy place to earn a spot in Washington . Buzzi , is and always will be , Buzzi . . she is the busybody always organizing something , and is aggravating as ever . I imagine that those still populating drive-ins as this flick came out ( . . I'm guessing , temporarily ) probably cheered when Buzzi was on her way out of the picture . I think Dorothy Malone is a sex icon thanks to her work with Douglas Sirk , specifically her delicious nymphomaniac in " Written in the Wind " , but is handed a terribly thankless ( . . practically meaningless , if the script hadn't made her son the one effected by the toxic waste ) role in this steaming pile . On Jackie Kong's directorial decisions come a narrative voice at the opening after a radio DJ tells us about rain showers and thunderstorms moving into the area , prophetically announces doom to the little town of Pottsville , Idaho . She also gives us a run-down at what the surviving characters did with their lives after the incident at Pottsville is over . The climactic showdown between the hilarious monster and Osco should earn some good laughs . This hunk of excrement will probably work the best for fans of rancid schlock . I did find the drive-in sequence near the beginning pretty fun . . the movie playing equals " The Being " in quality which I find irony in . There's an attack scene where the monster , in gelatinous form , oozes from the air conditioning vents and radio to somehow kill a couple making out . It also puts an arm through a deputy holding his heart . Most victims , though , are pulled away by the thing . Best kill is probably the poor kid who tries to escape the monster getting his head removed .
435979	9938570	96118	2.0	Unhappy Campers . . Unhappy Movie-watcher	Absolutely putrid slasher film has not one redeeming quality . It has Camp Councellor Angela ( Pamela Anderson . . awful as the killer ; her quips when she wastes people aren't even amusing ) on the warpath slaying teenagers who act the least bit naughty or resist her pleadings for good behavior . We run the gamut of boring , clichéd killings such as the slashing to the throat to one kid looking for his Freddy clawed glove , a kid who gets a chainsaw , one girl who gets drilled , one who gets shoved into the crapper ( filled with leeches ) , one who is roasted , etc . It doesn't have one original idea to offer and is merely a waste of time . That is unless you want to see Valerie Hartmen's ( who plays the slut Ally ) tits . Most of the violence occurs off-screen so even that will not satisfy .
436334	9938570	98320	2.0	Shocker	A serial killer of families , Horace Pinker ( Mitch Pileggi , really overexerting himself ) , makes a deal with a demon or evil spirit or something for which provides him with an opportunity to travel from human body to human body thanks to some sort of electrical current spawning from a botched execution in the Chair . He has one main goal , other than killing as many families as possible , and that is to kill his son , Jonathan ( Peter Berg , whose face remains frozen in a state of cluelessness for most of the picture when he isn't constantly running from the killer ) . He already brutally murdered Jonathan's mother and lover Alison . . he even kills the guy's football coach and pal ( Ted Raimi , Sam's bro ) . Michael Murphy ( why is he in a movie like this ? ) portrays Don , Jonathan's foster father and cop trying to nab Pinker and then worried about his son Jonathan sore afraid he's losing his mental faculties as well with all this talk of Pinker flowing through the bodies of different people and electrical outlets . Jonathan's pretty lucky Pinker couldn't shoot if his life depended on it because he wastes two different guns trying to plug him . Once Pinker has become this electrical traveling journeyman , only one thing can stop him from taking over a host shell until the lifeforce is sucked dry . . strong willpower or a specific heart-shaped necklace worn by Jonathan's beloved victim of Pinker . Soon , Pinker and Jonathan battle inside the television switching from program to program until his football buddies shut off the main power to the city closing the gateway of electrical travel . Really , really awful Wes Craven vehicle is bad beyond mere mortal words . It has lots of special effects in it , but the story-telling is so insipid , uninspired , and reckless you never fully know how the hell Pinker could accomplish such a feat . The film is crippled by ineptitude thanks to the premise's overall goofiness . What also hurts is the fact that Alison's ghost seems to fight Pinker . . how ? The necklace that seems to weaken Pinker and how Alison just communicates away with Jonathan . . these elements just compile to create an unmitigated disaster . By far one of Craven's worst films . . if one didn't know Craven's other films , probably couldn't believe there isn't an amateur in the director's chair calling the shots . I mean the film never makes much sense and creates situations for it characters as it goes . What a disaster .
436326	9938570	82559	2.0	Hell of the Living Dead	A group of police officers , a reporter and her camera-man run afoul of New Guinea zombies , awakened from their death sleep by toxic vapors released accidentally from Hope Centre Nuclear plant . The police officers are supposed to meet the island that houses the Hope Centre plant , even though reporter Lia ( Margit Newton ) and her cameraman have no idea what their plans were . They run across a tribe who have not buried their dead , paying the price when they awaken with hunger for human flesh . Our " heroes " soon run up against another zombie horde when they stop off at a fancy estate and once they reach the nuclear plant destination . What were Hope Centre's real motives behind their nuclear program and will any of our " heroes " survive to tell the world that secret ? Bruno " Vincent Dawn " Mattei's zombie " film " is a laughing stock of badly edited tribal / nature footage , incredibly mindbogglingly rotten dialogue , over-the-top acting , and terrible make-up ( what's with the green and dark black mess scattered throughout the faces of these zombies ? ) . Some zombies turn immediately , others turn quite slowly . There's a social message in the plot regarding what the Hope Centre was concocting thanks to the government's desire to find an answer to overpopulation that gets little acceptance thanks to a film whose sole purpose is to sicken and repulse . Zombie gore in abundance and this has to be the film's main draw . . if you read the numerous " positive " user comments , even the most die-hard zombie fans claim this one is " so bad it's good . " I just thought it was bad , but so many have found enjoyment in this laugher . 10 pages of user comments ! I was in awe that a film like this could inspire so many opinions on it . I do say that this film is specifically designed for fans of flesh-eating splatter and masochists who enjoy terrible film-making . Some really wild scenes include a child turning on his father once he dies from a nasty flesh-wound , a dead elderly woman zombie with a cat that emerges from her torso ( ! ) , and a tribal woman ( with her child suckling her breast ) eating maggots from the eye socket of a rotted skull . The slow-motion nature scenes seem like little more than padding for the film since there's nothing much else going on . The Goblin score ( mostly ripped from Romero's DAWN OF THE DEAD ) is a welcome presence in this wasteland of ineptitude .
436963	9938570	469111	2.0	I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer	Four teens , about to graduate from high school , are part of a prank which leads to the accidental death of a dear friend , prepared for military service , whose dad was a police chief . Using the disguise of a former killer , from the first two " I KNow What You Did Last Summer " movies , the prank frightened the locals as a manhunt is underway due to the fact that those responsible made a pact of silence . A year later , July 4th , those who made this pact of silence will face an unknown psycho , dressed in the fisherman's slacks and wielding a wood-handled hook , dying one by one . Anyone with knowledge of the tragedy , keeping a vow of silence , are in grave danger . More of the same except this one has a cast of no-names and the killer in a fisherman's outfit , stabbing the victims with his hook whose identity is a real howler . The pacing lags like a snail , the plot is on life support with situations and characters very similar to those in the first . It'll feel like you're watching a cheaper , inferior version of " I Know What You Did Last Summer " . " I know what you did last summer " is spoken throughout as if the filmmakers insisted on reminding us of what movie we were watching . The director tries to implement jump scares which fall flat and jump cuts among other modern film-making techniques which annoy rather than startle . Unless you're a die hard fan of the first two films , not needing anything refreshing or interesting , hoping for that " same-ole / same-ole " effect , then this might work for you . It's minor budget shows . Nevin , as the final girl Amber is adequate , if average as the lead . Torrey DeVitto as Zoe , the alt rocker . David Paetkau as the Ryan Phillipe a-hole from the first film , Colby , Amber's ex-boyfriend . Seth Packard as the trickster who couldn't deal with their silence regarding the participation in an act that led to a good pal's tragic death . Ben Easter as Lance , the dead pal's cousin who knew about the prank and kept his mouth shut ( . . he's also the pretty boy who carries a torch for Amber , with them rekindling a few sparks present from the previous year ) . Most of the murders happen away from our sight , showing the looks on the character's faces as the hook stabs them , although one clever death sequence shows a police deputy impaled on a fork-lift tine . And , a combine harvester is used to okay effect . There's nothing special here and I'd say to look elsewhere for a decent slasher flick . The killer's mystery , for those who find importance in this aspect , will leave you rather underwhelmed , if laughing to yourself . But , it shouldn't have been made in the first place . . a , uninspired cash-in direct-to-DVD flick , that's instantly forgettable . To be honest , I had to fight nodding off .
436664	9938570	75035	2.0	Panic	A laboratory experiment goes terribly wrong leaving a scientist , Professor Adams , radioactively infected with a horrible mutation effecting his whole body . Now a grotesque cannibal lurking the underground sewer tunnels of the town of Newton , the powers-that-be are planning to drop nerve bombs if the monster isn't found and killed in time , so that the viral contagion Adams is currently carrying will be contained . If this drastic decision is to be halted , Captain Kirk ( David Warbeck ) , Adams ' lab assistant Jane Blake ( Janet Agren ) , and Newton's Police Sergeant O'Brien ( José Lifante ) will have to race against time to find the mutated fiend and save thousands of innocent lives . During this chase to find it , the monster is scouring streets targeting citizens , feasting on flesh , retreating to the sewers periodically to escape from harm . Rampaging through a theater , it finds a female as others flee , tearing away at her face right before Kirk is able to catch him . The monster breaks into the locked door of a Catholic church , invading a sacristy as a priest helps his choir boys find escape , murdering him as the padre defends his kids . Kirk's boss , Milton ( Franco Ressel ) unloads two shot gun blasts into the beast before it rips away at his leg . Even Kirk is able to unload an entire gun of bullets into the thing without downing the monster . This monster has quite a threshold , as Kirk and O'Brien flood the sewers with gas hoping to corner it after sealing off escape routes . That monster is damned elusive , that's for sure , quite motivated to keep on going , no matter the resistance it faces along the way . The version I watched , on a 50 pack of Mill Creek films , is incredibly murky and seems to be cut . The movie's absent of gore and the monster itself is wisely hidden in darkness , with only mutated ( . . latex ) flesh made visible as light briefly flashes on it while in pursuit of new victims to eat . I didn't think the monster is very convincing when the film finally unveils it at the end . I won't lie , this was a pain to sit through ; positively boring , with an absence of thrills . If the plot were even remotely original or effective , I might've enjoyed it more . On paper , this hybrid of suspense elements ( monster on the loose eating folks ; threat of spread virus ; possible nuking of town ) should be a winner , but under the direction of Tonino Ricci , it plods along at a languid pace covering familiar ground formerly trampled on by more capable filmmakers . In the version I watched , the scenes of violence disappear from the screen as the monster often engulfs the entire frame . Even as Kirk and O'Brien survey the crime scene carnage left in the monster's wake , Ricci fails to give the viewer the gory goods . Just a sheer disappointment that , if handled by someone else , might've been better . An Italian production with the story set in England ( why not Rome ? ) .
436174	9938570	416918	2.0	Lethal Eviction	The tenants of a decrepit apartment complex fall prey to a killer hidden slightly out of the camera frame with the viewer only getting a glimpse of hands and , at times , a shadowy figure in the darkness . The film's main focal point are " twins " Sarah and Tess who are staying in adjoining rooms but never seen together by anyone other than us ( . . and even that is through an oddly tilted mirror ) . Sarah is the quiet , kind , caring sister while Tess is a grungy , sad , volatile who was recently a member of a psychiatric facility . Amanda ( Stacey Dash , who looks terrific ) , with assistance from dear old daddy , Gus ( James Avery ) is the new apartment manager who wishes to relieve herself of older tenants so that she can hike up the rent . Then there's Tess ' former attending physician Dr . Sheppard ( Judd Nelson ) who has been having a recurring nightmare of his murder at the hands of his former patient . Shep will seek her out because he's afraid that Tess is still not mentally well and needs help . Soon a drug-pusher Sarah has a history with named Brian ( Adam Huss ) , an old busybody , Elsa ( Michael Learned ) , and two goofy friends of Brian's ( Mark Shunock & Marshall Cook ) are all potential victims . Sarah has a transvestite pal named Hector ( Andy Martinez , Jr ) & a new love-interest named Ian ( Todd Babcock ) . Carpenter , in the leading " dual " roles , is pretty dreadful , Judd's had better hair days , the film lacks any suspense , is boring & cliché . Seek your entertainment elsewhere .
436699	9938570	127282	2.0	Shrieker	Hunk of trash only the Full Moon Studios could make has a group of college kids , staying for free in an old hospital with no one knowing , as a demonic creature with two faces ( barely visible the entire film because of incomprehensible lighting ) passes through walls killing each member who has a certain sheet of paper with ancient markings . Someone amongst them ( it won't be too hard to prove , but a slight twist is so uninspiringly revealed and limply executed you'll just scoff ) is the mastermind behind who the beast kills and must be revealed before it kills everyone . Cheap , badly acted mess has a " That's it ? ! " kind of weak ending that'll have you exasperated at why you just wasted your time . Tanya Dempsey , who couldn't act her way through a wet paper sack , has the heroine duties as the newest member of the college rooming bunch named Clark . Oh , and the title refers to the sound the beast makes before it attacks it's next victim .
436128	9938570	96119	3.0	Sleepaway Camp III : Teenage Wasteland	Tongue-in-cheek slasher spoof , made back-to-back with the previous installment , Unhappy Campers , from director Michael A Simpson and writer Fritz Gordon , has serial killing transsexual Angela Baker ( Pamela Springsteen ) assuming the identity of Maria , a street kid she plows through with a garbage truck , so she can infiltrate a new Summer Camp near where she was once counselor . The camp is an experiment where underprivileged and rich youth join together in a unified setting proving that " we all can get along " no matter what kind of family and locale we come from . It goes horribly wrong when Angela , under wig , returns to her " Angel of Death " role murdering those she considers morally corrupt . Three wilderness groups are formed with the various youth camps spreading out with a counselor assigned with Angela wiping out one set of victims at a time , moving to the next one when she's finished . Before you know it , there are few left to slaughter . Cute red-head Tracy Griffith ( Skeeter ; The Final Power ) as a suburban band student , and potential boy-toy , East LA Latino " thug-with-a-heart-o-gold " , Tony ( Mark Oliver ) soon find themselves baring witness to Angela's rampage perhaps doomed to the same fate . Kooky B-movie character actor Michael J Pollard has a funny role as one of the founding counselors , with a Playboy bunny belt buckle , who tries landing a wealthy " skank " in a tent , actually succeeding before Angela corners him for execution , sickened at his fornication . Cliff Brand is a cop , Barney Whitmore whose son was beheaded by Angela , the third counselor hoping to someday catch and kill the murderess responsible . Sandra Dorsey is lazy counselor Lily who has her campers performing menial tasks for her such as taking away the trash and bringing her bug spray . Her demise , through the use of a lawnmower , is rather unique . The other victims are the same clichés paraded out for Angela to dispatch in one way or another . Those who either rent or purchase the DVD should check out the raw gore footage included in the special features . While most of them pretty remain intact within the finished product , there's a beheading from Angela's ax ( . . showing hands still moving with gushing blood flowing ) and a nasty aftermath of a victim hoisted by Angela up a flag pole falling head-first splatting to the ground , that are rather memorable . While the sequels to the franchise have a fervent cult following ( . . Angela using various methods to destroy human lives , following up each murder with a type of witty / witless one-liner ) who embrace them as cheesy 80's slasher flicks , I really find them rather joy-less exercises , with most of the murders cheap and clumsy . They are really no different than those repeated Friday the 13th sequels , with Angela assuming Voorhies ' role , with the exception of her being a chick and alive . The idea that Angela can kill so many without being discovered is a stretch , to say the least , especially with all the screaming . And , while many love the warped humor Angela provides , this sequel even strains to deliver in that category , giving us something to smirk at here and there because most of the characters are developed for us to despise so that we can giggle when she destroys them in creative ways . One victim has his arms removed by a rope tied to a jeep Angela drives . An ignited fire-cracker is used on a practical joker's face . Angela uses a stick to pummel victims across the head . One is shot several times by a gun into the chest . Tent spikes are hammered into a victim's hand and head . But , even though they sound gruesome , director Simpson shies away from displaying the gory goods for the audience clamoring for such violence .
436568	9938570	99994	3.0	Leatherface : Texas Chainsaw Massacre III	A boyfriend and girlfriend traveling through Texas on their way to Florida have the misfortune of running up against the likes of Leatherface and a brand new clan of nutcases ( including a young Viggo Mortensen ) . The film shows a barren landscape of dirt and forest . The forest is the setting at night and inside it is where Leatherface and his clan ( including a mother with a mechanical voicebox and a father whose been dead quite a long time ) live . . a compound very similar to the one we are familiar with from the first film . Ken Foree is Benny , a hunter passing through who almost hits the couple trying to flee Leatherface who had just tore the trunk door off it's hinges . Will Benny be able to help the couple escape the cannibal clan's clutches ? I watched the mutilated version with studio demanded cuts . If it weren't for the excessive profanity , this could've easily covered the PG-13 market because the gore is missing . Even true graphic violence almost always appears off-camera . The ending feels like it was hacked by a chainsaw . And , Benny must have 9 lives , because there are at least three different instances where , for all intensive purposes , he should've been killed . The flick's cannibal clan aren't that demented enough and the direction is rather limp . There's no moment in this flick that raises you to a different level and the photography is just not that effective . The film might increase in quality a notch if the gory bits are inserted , but I'm not sure if even that will help much . The flick is uninspired and silly . Leatherface , despite his BIG chainsaw , isn't that menacing or memorable . Kate Hodge , as the terrorized female , is not very good . She really isn't even put to the test like often happens in other films . It also feels like it aspires to be a macabre comedy which might work if the humor was smart enough . It could just come down to Burr's direction which is anything but stellar .
436389	9938570	430684	3.0	Tomb of the Werewolf	Elizabeth Bathory ( Michelle Bauer , REALLY getting into the role ) agrees to sacrifice female victims . . and , most importantly , bathe in their blood . . to her Lord Lucifer in exchange for eternal beauty and youth . A broke , yet brimming with charm , final descendant of the cursed Daninsky line , Richard ( Olen Ray alum , Jay Richardson ) asks for the face , Melanie ( Danielle Petty ) and producer Tony ( Leland Jay ) of the low-rent television program , Current Mysteries , to host a show at his family's European home of the infamous late Waldemar Daninsky ( Paul Naschy , merely in it for a little bit to get paid , but one can see he at least cares ) . Waldemar was on the verge of losing his beloved Eleanor ( Stephanie Bentley ) to the black plague when Ebath posed an offer he doesn't refuse . . in exchange for Eleanor's life , he sells his soul to Lucifer's angel , yet in return is cursed with lycanthropy . It is written he attacked , and killed , Eleanor when under the full moon curse . Imprisoned and killed with a silver cross embedded in his heart , Ebath will hypnotically force Richard to release Waldemar from his slumber , removing the large dagger as the werewolf emerges from his crypt to kill again . During the day we see a weary Waldemar looking on in sadness from the bushes and over cornered walls of his estate and the crew of Current Mysteries remain around the manor conducting their affairs . What Richard was seeking is supposed treasure , but this was merely a ruse by Ebath for unleashing Waldemar once again as anyone who has the misfortune of standing in the path of the werewolf will be torn into . Meanwhile , aging skin will force Ebath to chose another victim of the Current Mysteries crew for their blood . Well , to be honest , this is a sex movie without the special ingredient one watches it for . In actuality the film is smut masquerading as a horror film . . perhaps , that's why the sex scenes are removed . The distributer perhaps wanted this film to be marketed as a legitimate werewolf horror flick . . to it's credit there is some werewolf carnage . Some torn throats as flesh is ripped away as the werewolf munches away quite rabidly . Bauer really just let's it hang out as E Bathory just bathing in the red stuff and slurping away . In the version I watched , there's ample nudity ( mostly breasts ) and the lesbian sequences consist of groping and kissing . The cast is equipped with porn stars so you ought to know where this film's head is mostly at . . but , without the sex , the film really only consists of bad actors and uninspired dialogue . I rented it as a Paul Naschy / werewolf completest , but one shouldn't go into this thing expecting a massive amount of thrills . At least if the sex had remained , a certain crowd could've had that aspect for pleasure . As is , the film is cheaply made trying to have us believe the setting is in Europe with poor effects . For Fred Olen Ray fans only . Danielle Petty is quite striking as the raven-haired Melanie . . both in and out of clothes .
436601	9938570	314204	3.0	Creature Unknown	" Steve " ( Chris Hoffman ) gathers a group from high school for a reunion at the cabin location where his twin brother Wes went missing . While they are there , a reptilian creature in the shape of a man ( reminded me a lot of the Gillman from CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON ) awaits in the wilderness choosing the right time to pick them apart one by one . A biker , Ellen Ripley-type time female bad-ass , Kat ( Chase Masterson ) has an underground military bunker she practices experiments in , while it also serves as a place of safety from the thing on the bloody rampage . Kat knows more than she's telling ( she also suffered the loss of a child ) , but there's another novelty twist most of the group have no idea of . This creature might just be more human than they realize . . and it's former identity might shed some light on a deception only one other person has been hiding since Wes ' death . Kat holds the key to many of the mysteries that unlock as the group remains near the cabin . Thankfully , a large portion of the film stays away from the creature which leaps in the air while we also see a hazy screen when we look through it's eyes . The film has Dawson's Creek-type melodramatics which often hinder any real tension that needs to build in a little monster movie . The direction is very bland leading to a relatively dull experience instead of eliciting scares . The cast is rather life-less and uninteresting . Pretty Maggie Grace ( THE FOG remake ) might be the only draw for this film .
436683	9938570	56528	4.0	Slaughter of the Vampires	A vampire ( a hammy Dieter Eppler who moves as fast as lightning with little to no dialogue ) terrorizes Aristocrat married couple Wolfgang ( Walter Brandi ) and large-chested Louise ( the ravishing Graziella Granata ) in an old granite castle where he rests his coffin in the wine cellar . The vampire also eyes the other females ( including the little girl of a gardener as well ) . . he just wishes to infect as many of the ladies as possible . It will be up to Dr . Nietzsche , vampire slayer ( Luigi Batzella , always puffing a cigar ) to stop the bloodthirsty menace or else . Despite lavish castle setting and the ruins around it , good fluid camera-work , and attractive lighting , this flick suffers from really bad dialogue and dubbing that's hard to shake off . It has too many dull patches and often feels a lot longer than 80 minutes . Eppler isn't very impressive as the vamp despite having a towering presence . . something's wrong with that . Granata as the fetching Louise makes delicious eye candy . Bloodless bite sequences and we never see puncture wounds where the vampire bites his victims despite those neckless gowns Granata wears ( and with such an enticing neck , wounds should certainly show ) only adds to the problems of the film .

They will soon become allies in a battle against zombies whose skin is a ghastly , ghostly white with yellow goo replacing red blood in their bodies . . if the zombies touch you , a steam becomes present and the acidic grasp kills . Alcoholic Sheriff Will Stewart ( Bo Hopkins ) , who is reeling from the accidental shooting of a child when he once a big city cop , is quite bewildered at what is happening to his town . He'll have to join forces , albeit reluctantly , with Josh to stop the carnage of the zombie outbreak . Can Will convince outstand law enforcement of the horror that has overwhelmed his little town ? Can the outbreak itself be silenced or is the threat to the entire country a possibility ? Average zombie flick doesn't have much originality . The closing final twenty minutes ratchets up the suspense as poor Josh and Holly become besieged by the monsters they once knew as regular people . There's a harrowing school sequence where Holly loses a young student she is trying to protect to the toxic little monsters as they invade a restroom . The film expects us to believe Josh & Holly could escape an army of those things as the screenplay allows them too much leeway , illogically , apart from them . Take a scene in an abandoned gas station where they are absolutely surrounded , yet the toxic monsters , a crap-load of them , don't simply attack when there's absolutely nowhere to run . Time and time again , the screenplay allows Josh to escape certain doom . The plot is just too unrealistic . And , how the zombies mutate ( from drinking toxic water ) after a lengthly illness seems rather far-fetched and silly . Jennifer Warren portrays Dr . Myra Tate who is a former squeeze of Will's and the town's female doctor whose assistant changes into a mutant attacking her .
436826	9938570	74434	4.0	Drive-in Massacre	A psychopath is slicing the heads off of victims in cars with a sword at a local drive-in and it's up to Detectives Larry and Mike ( Bruce Kimball and Steve Vincent ) to find out who it is . The drive-in theater was once a carnival and many of those who worked in it are employed . It could very well be the incredibly cranky , ornery , and all-around rude theater manager , Austin Johnson ( Newton Naushaus ) whose foul attitude stinks something rotten ; once the barker , he has been left to take care of the entire business while his former employer sold the farm and ran off to Hawaii or some place . Another suspect is the " half-wit " janitor , Germy ( Douglas Gudbye ) who is an admitted former sword swallower , but seems too mild-mannered and simple-minded to be a killer . The main suspect is Orville ( Norman Sherlock ) , a creepy peeping tom , spotted by Germy hanging around cars , spying on certain couples making out . The detectives attempt woefully to solve the case but their methods are a bit suspect ( . . why would you associate yourself with Germy , a possible suspect , no matter how nice and hospitable he might be ? ) . . I mean two victims are killed in cars not feet from where they were staking out ! The major problem established by a host of other users is the languid pace of the entire film . Some interrogation sequences are stretched too long and we witness the uncomfortable cast languishing with rather dire material . I did find the foul character of Johnson rather amusing in how he describes everyone he comes in contact with . . never a kind word for anyone , he's quite the misanthrope . Johnson is the kind of character you yearn to see get stabbed in the throat with a sword . I also enjoyed the opening beheading . . but director Seagall doesn't quite match this with the subsequent killings ( . . one victim's head falls off and a couple is skewered by the dreaded sword while hugging ) . There's a bizarre red herring set-up featuring the great Buck Flower chasing after a female victim ( . . actually played by his real daughter Verkina ! ) inside a warehouse with a machete ( . . he's considered a suspect , but anyone in their right mind knows that the film will ultimately end at the drive-in ) . The truly horrible climax at the end punctuates a rather ineptly made film . . attempting to leave open the killer's identity , it only has you scratching your head . A plausible climax determining who between two obvious suspects might in fact be the real killer would've at least provided a satisfying conclusion to a rather poorly conceived horror film . The really oddball sequence where Larry and Mike are questioning Orville in his home ( . . with nude posters of models pinned all over his living room walls ) really has to be seen to be believed . . seeing Orville squirming and wallowing in misery over his sexual appetites ( . . he even admits out loud to " beating his meat " while at the drive-in , completely overwhelmed in embarrassment ! ) while the detectives appear quite appalled . A film like Drive-in Massacre only proved that in the 70's almost anyone could make a movie .
436910	9938570	98331	4.0	Silent Night , Deadly Night III	Pretty blind Laura ( Samantha Scully playing her cold and distant making it especially hard to sympathize with her plight ) is psychically linked to comatose serial killer Ricky ( Bill Moseley , completely devoid of emotion . . pretty much a walking robot who seems to explode through doors without even cutting himself and takes very slow steps ) thanks to the experiments of Dr . Newbury ( Richard Beymer ) who was able to reconstruct the man's brain placing a glass dome on his head ( . . this is to ensure that nothing touches the brain as it is exposed ) . These experiments is to generate thoughts and images from Ricky's fractured , emotionally damaged mind that might assist him in his goal to free guilty minds through " evil thought cleansing " . But , the experiment goes awry when Laura's tapping into deep wounding past nightmares awakens Ricky who will pursue her , killing anyone who comes in his path . The color red ( or anything representing the Santa Claus killer who took his parents ' lives ) triggers the kill mechanism in Ricky's demented mental framework . Laura is going to Granny's for the holidays with brother Chris ( Eric DaRe ) and his girlfriend Jerri ( Laura Harring ) . Through their psychic link , Ricky can see where they are heading , somehow getting there before they can killing Granny . Without their knowledge of Ricky being at Granny's house , Laura will use uncomfortable feelings ( she can sense something's wrong ) to understand that something is not quite right . . it only increases when Granny is nowhere to be found . Lt Connely ( Robert Culp , a much welcome presence to the proceedings ) will need the help of Dr . Newbury to find and stop Ricky before his rampage leaves a lot of dead bodies . . and is Laura's only hope . Far-fetched premise and incredibly slow killer hinder the peculiar , weird atmosphere of the horror flick . Definitely unlike the previous two films , this is not the slightest bit gory . Blood splatter as violence to others occurs off-screen is about as gross as it gets . It also features a heroine with a potty-mouth and icy demeanor who you have a hard time rooting for . And , with such a robotic , monotonously slow psycho , it's mighty hard getting scares out of the hunting of victims . His amazing power is completely laughable as well . . I mean he receives a shot-gun blast that forcefully throws him across the floor , yet he's able to get up and attack brother Chris who is quite bigger than Ricky .
436547	9938570	82467	4.0	Graduation Day	High school female track star dies of a blood clot after winning a race with the community in an uproar against Coach George Michaels ( Christopher George playing him as a major butt-head who is VERY demanding of the athletes under his watch ) . He'll be canned after school lets out providing the flick with his motive as a possible killer . Some twisted psychopath in sweats ( much the same as what Michaels is often seen wearing ) , using a stop watch to time his executions , murders the members of the track team the dead female runner was a part of . Soon disturbed parents call Principal Guglione ( Michael Pataki ) wondering why their children didn't come home after a prom party . Inspector Halliday ( Carmen Argenziano ) begins snooping around campus at worried parents ' request . Instantly a beleaguered Michaels becomes a prime suspect after the body of a gymnast is found in a locker . Ensign Anne ( Patch Mackenzie ) returned home from her base in Guam to receive her dead track sister's diploma and soon confronts the killer herself in the climactic chase scene . Kevin Badger ( E Danny Murphy ) is the weary boyfriend of the lost track star . Rather leisurely paced slasher spreads out the death sequences quite a bit trying to mix humor within and rather failing miserably . Low-quality kill sequences only increase the laughter such as a sword embedded within a football thrown into the stomach of a football player or a pair of garden shears used to behead a poor soul taking a leak . Linnea Quigley has an amusing role as horny student Dolores who sleeps with her music teacher for a higher grade and always chases after a male stud ( the recipient of the garden shears before he has a chance to bed Dolores outside of the prom party ) . Vanna White has an early role here as a ditsy blonde who discovers the dead gymnast's body in the locker . Virgil Frye has a silly role as an inept officer .
435791	9938570	82910	4.0	Piranha II : The Spawning	Police Chief Steve Kimbrough ( Lance Henriksen ) has a problem on his hands . . killer piranha fish can fly ( ! ) and they are quite hungry for the tourists that populate his island . His ex wife Anne ( Tricia O'Neil , who is actually quite good ) is a scuba instructor who loses one of her students when he decides , against warning , to search an old wreckage which housed the piranha . When dead bodies start to increase , Anne tries to warn Hotel Manager Raoul ( Ted Richart , who is basically representing the clichéd manager who doesn't respond well to warnings from his staff or police about possible harm to unknowing tourists for business purposes ) to no avail . She also begins an affair with Tyler Sherman ( Steve Marachuk ) who she finds out is a bio-chemist and one of those scientists responsible for creating the damn things eating people . Another horrifying element is that Anne and Steve's son , Chris ( Ricky Paull Golden ) is out there assisting a wealthy man's boat ride . Goofy sequel shows first-time director James Cameron ( who would , three years later , get it right with his awesome sci-fi action masterpiece , " The Terminator " ) was a bit green on how to create any sense of realism in this silly premise trying to make silly jokes work and his characters quirky . The film does have gore as these piranha behave like bats flying for the jugular ripping throats to shreds of victims . The sequence where tourists get slaughtered in one giant wallop of an attack is inspired and bloody . The film just can not escape it's ultra-silly idea . There ' s one scene that had me rolling in the floor at it's absurdity : a clean-up lady in a morgue catches a piranha in her throat as he plunges at her from the torso of a dead victim !
436009	9938570	83973	4.0	Frightmare	Conrad Radzoff ( Ferdy Mayne ) , a hammy cult icon , dies from a heart ailment ( not before disposing of an ungrateful assistant and TV commercial director , both of whom disrespected him with showers of insults ) . His body is removed from his mausoleum by some film students ( they wish to " invite him to dinner " . . they are quite big fans ) . What these kids ( . . including a young Jeffrey Combs ) don't expect is that Radzoff will be resurrected by a medium to wreak havoc on those who removed him from his place of rest . The list of violent acts include Radzoff pulling one guy's tongue out , setting a woman on fire , elevating a casket which crushes a woman's face , decapitates one fellow , and cremates another guy alive in a coffin . A really weird soundtrack and pesky fog wraps around Radzoff's ghoulish activities . Silly hokum from Troma is limited by a very , very low budget and slowwwwww pace . The film feels a lot longer than it is . The film isn't really that gory and we can hardly see much violence because the film is often too damn dark . At times , Radzoff is an ominous presence , yet at other times he just looks real silly .
436160	9938570	95179	4.0	The New Blood : Friday the 13th VI	An emotionally fragile young woman , Tina ( Lar Park Lincoln ) , whose dangerous telekinetic powers led to the murder of her abusive father as a child , returns to Crystal Lake years later at the scene where that incident took place thanks to her demanding psychologist , Dr . Crews ( a delightfully slimy Terry Kiser , easily the most interesting character , and better than average performance , of the film ) who secretly plans to exploit her abilities when she's able to control them . In anger at the difficult situation she's facing , she releases a " telekinetic shockwave " which unleashes Jason Voorhees from the bouldered chain holding him captive underwater . Across from her cabin is a birthday celebration being held by a group of young adults who will unknowingly fall one by one to the hockey-masked psycho ready to pick up where he left off many years ago . If director John Carl Buechler had been able to deliver to franchise fans the version he made , this would be mentioned in the same breath as bloody slasher faves , " Maniac " & " The Prowler " ( . . even " The Prowler " director Joseph Zito's Friday film is allowed bloody rites ) . Having seen the deleted gore scenes , you can not help but feel slighted by those involved with censoring ( . . more like butchering ) this sequel . It's a shame because the deleted footage is in rather bad shape , having been buried in Paramount's vault unprotected for many years without much care it seems . There are some really inspired gory bits such as Jason forming his hands into a vice crushing one poor soul's skull like a walnut as blood squirts from the orifices of his face , one victim receiving a chopping ax to the face opening a gaping crevice with gushing blood , one man getting Jason's arm ran completely through him , and another penetrated through the stomach with a spinning saw blade . As is , the slasher film is mostly Jason killing victims off-screen , wiping away the make-up grue completed by the special effects company . What ultimately hurts this film is that the cast of victims attending a supposed birthday party ( . . and a few scattered victims elsewhere Jason runs into ) aren't very interesting at all , merely the same repeated clichés you expect in a sixth sequel to a franchise whose best days seem long past . If you don't have , at the very least , the gory bits inserted into the final product , what's the point of sitting through this umpteenth sequel ? This type of slasher product is specifically designed for Friday fans and gorehounds . . if this film isn't allowed to cater to those it's designed for , what is the point of releasing this film at all ? Anyway , the film's bread and butter has to be the special effects showcase at the end as Tina faces off with Jason . . for once , Jason is provided a worthy adversary who can oppose him . I think this is the only success of true note for Buechler , except some effective camera shots of Jason around cabins , in the woods , and following him as he closes in on those who are about to meet their maker . I do think Hodder is the best representation of Jason , and his make-up job ( both his rotting body and shredded outfit and facial work ) is great . The house explosion at the end is well executed as well . The rating I give the film is for the finished product forced against the director's wishes onto the viewer .
436457	9938570	90750	4.0	Blood Hook	Cheap no-budget slasher with a rather absurd premise . . the ever increasing sound of cicadas who react strongly to rock music ( ! ) cause a local fisherman ( . . whose metal plate in his skull , a surgical procedure made after getting shot in the head during the Korean war , causes such harsh vibrations that he responds violently ) to go berserk casting his line towards unfortunate victims in his general area , the massive float and numerous hooks embedded in the flesh jerking them towards him . He chops the victims up and uses their meat for feeding his minnows ! It seems that this grisly process helps him lure in more quality fish ! A small group of teenager friends enter this fishing village as a tournament is about to begin . As we witness in the opening , Peter van Cleese ( Mark Jacobs ) returns to the place where he watched his father fall into the river never to be found , the loud cicadas skrieking due to the music playing on a tape player . Peter has remained troubled due to this incident and is unwelcome by his father's grounds-keeper , Wayne Duerst ( Paul Drake ) , a very bitter and rude old man who holds a hostility for how his lost friend mysteriously vanished . Wayne's rather unbalanced son , Evelyn ( . . the blubbery Bill Lowrie , with some truly awful dialogue he must endure , trying to express a very disturbed , volatile , and ugly creation of the Vietnam war in an over-the-top and outrageous manner ) hangs around the place , causing the city kids some unneeded aggravation . We also follow a family of four , who enter the fishing community on vacation with father and mother Roger & Shiela Swain ( Don Cosgrove & Bonnie Lee ) falling prey to the homicidal fisherman , Leroy Leudke ( Don Winters ) . . Irving and Ruth-Ann ( Greg Nienas and Julie Vortanz ) are left worried about their parents whereabouts as the local sheriff ( Paul Heckman ) , burdened with little manpower , must begin an investigation in such a prosperous time for his community . Of importance to the advancing plot , Irving uses a metal detector given to him by a more mentally balanced Leudke , to discover certain truths which will indicate the fisherman of his sinister deeds . In a minor sub-plot , Peter's pal , Finner ( Christopher Whiting ) and a local gal , Bev D ( Sandy Meuwissen ) have a blossoming romance that is disrupted rather quickly when it's discovered that her husband is Evelyn ! As Peter pursues the one responsible for attacks on his friends , he'll need some help from Wayne in order to do so . The gore is at a minimum , with most victims , from a large distance , getting hooked by Leudke ( . . always out of frame ) either swimming , on a boat or float , even on ground . It's hard to take these attacks seriously as the victims are strong enough to outlast Leudke who must reel them in like a fish . . it's just too ridiculous ( . . particularly Peter's girlfriend , Ann ( Lisa Todd ) who is a good distance away when the master fisherman snags her ) , and illogical to expect any one with such capacity to pull a victim into the water , reel them in despite resistance , bound them , carry them all the way back to his dock , and subdue them . We often see victims struggling with the hooks , attempting to free themselves as Leudke yanks and jerks . Peter's friends are extremely obnoxious , very vulgar and rude , acknowledging that visitors from the city deserve to die and horribly as they enter the uncharted territory of a rural fishing village . This is even painted with the suburban family whose patriarch is a big city hot shot , deeming himself the expert fisherman because he could afford the very best materials needed for the sport , with the perfectly annoying , nagging wife . The locals are a collection of colorful oddballs , as expected when depicted in the backwoods regions of rural America . One effects sequence is terribly executed and laughable , when Leudke nabs a victim , he jabs a rod into his neck , through his lower jaw so that he can pull a hook out his mouth . . the cast of the actor's complete face looks exactly that with little authenticity . The cheap budget shows all the way through . The premise is original , but too nonsensical for it's own good . . how could even an expert fisherman as Leudke be able to accurately hook victims from such a distance away ? Still , it's rare to see a slasher film set in a fishing community using the tools of the trade so at least it has that going for it . Director Jim Mallon is best known for his duties as executive producer for Mystery Science Theater 3000 . This film was released by Team Troma , but doesn't carry it's usual trademarks , except for the low budget , weirdo characters , bad acting , and strange plot .
436040	9938570	462485	5.0	Poultrygeist : Night of the Chicken Dead	Director Lloyd Kaufman returns with another no-holds-barred gore-fest , completely tongue-in-cheek , with plenty of offensive jokes and gags to ridicule nearly every kind of religion and race . Wherever you stand , this film likely pokes fun at you . Parts musical ( ! ) with characters bursting into song at certain points during the plot ( . . or what plot there is ) . A chicken restaurant is built on an ancient Indian burial ground , but this is used merely as an excuse to enact some of the most sickening acts of violence you could ever hope for , even seeing humans transforming into sadistic cannibalistic beaked birds . The film centers around nerd Arbie ( Jason Yachanin ) who is irate at his girlfriend's new position as both a lesbian and vegetarian , whose latest lay is an activist against that chicken restaurant on the burial ground . Arbie takes a job at the place in revenge , but agonizes over her leaving him for another , the choice being a woman even infuriates him more . Wendy doesn't know her lover's true motivations , which have a lot to do with the franchise their protesting . The chicken become " infected " by eggs carrying " evil spirits " ( . . more like a type of green goo , often seen in Troma films ) and when customers eat the food they hideously deform into birds with an appetite for human flesh . We are privy to the siege on the restaurant , Arbie's fellow co-workers falling prey to the infection , and his attempts to protect Wendy as zombie chicken humans attempt to rip apart anyone human . As always , Kaufman finds every kind of way to shock and disgust , through grotesque gore-murders and parodying political and religious people in equal measure . I think his main target are both vegetarians and meat-eaters , many often killed in hideous methods imaginable . As you'd expect , the cast know what kind of movie they're in and perform in that fashion . Kate Graham goes all out as Arbie's love , Wendy , but , to me , Allyson Sereboff was frighteningly skinny as her lesbian lover Micki . Robin Watkins , as corrupt businessman General Lee Roy , grins wide and sends up the hick image with gusto , wearing white and deceiving his customers , knowing that his product has been corrupted by something poisonous and dangerous to humans . There's an orgy of violence and sex in one lengthy sequence where the customers who ate polluted chicken either turn into bird-zombies or those human casualties who are torn into for consumption . Kaufman has lots of grotesque mutations springing from the human bodies reaction to turning into birds . There were times where I thought I was gonna hurl . One victim sprouts " egg-breasts " hatching chicks ! A person's face is pulled off . A broom is stabbed completely through a bird-zombie's crotch . A victim is pushed into a slicer with blood and flesh ( . . and a leg ) spraying all over the restaurant kitchen . A victim's face is forced into a slicer . I could go on and on . Zombie fans craving flesh eating will be satisfied . In other words , if you are a gorehound , then this flick will give you plenty to cheer about . I could do without the musical numbers and many of the jokes and gags fall flat , but it often made me cringe , and I did find the overall film amusing . Jihad or Catholic Priest , gay or straight , black or white , everyone is skewered , Troma fans should be in heaven . Kaufman has a funny supporting part as Arbie in a few decades , reminding him that this is not the career one should strive for . To describe the film's tastelessness , an employee at the restaurant , screws a dead chicken , before it was to be prepared for cooking , with it possessed and growing into a monster on his crotch !
436615	9938570	87981	5.0	Razorback	A man ( Gregory Harrison ) , shaken from the disappearance of his pregnant reporter / animal activist wife , enters the garbage-strewn , desolate , uncompromising Outback to find her , running into intimidating , troublesome kangaroo poachers ( typical undesirables that often populate Russell Mulcahy's films ) and a gigantic killer boar . The Outback town of Gamulla looks like the type of barren wasteland devastated by nuclear war in apocalyptic films and is photographed as quite menacing while at the same time stunning . While the film is indeed quite ugly , chock full of rotted dead trees , sand holes that have the shape of moon craters , and dust that is thick enough to cut a knife through , there are some amazingly shot sequences at night using light , shadow & cold breath . My favorite sequence has a lost Harrison , abandoned by the two poachers responsible for leaving his wife at the mercy of the giant razorback , trying to find a haven as the Outback becomes a surreal hellish nightmare where giant cracks open upon the ground and dead skeletal animals rise from the earth . In the stunning opening scene , hunter Jake Cullen ( Bill Kerr ) watches as the razorback burrows through his home snatching his grandson as the moon light spirals through a windmill nearby . David Argue & Chris Haywood portray the grungy , unclean Baker brothers who run a meat plant cutting pigs and kangaroos who wish for their secret illegal practices of catching animals to remain under wraps . Arkie Whiteley portrays Sarah , a young woman who researches the growth and well being of boars in the Outback where she lives by tagging them , keeping up with their movements by a computer tracking device ; she strikes up a friendship with Harrison's Carl . Jake's mission in life is to kill the razorback which ate his grandson . The climax takes place in the Pet Pak facility where the Baker brothers cut their meat for storage .
436861	9938570	38934	5.0	She-Wolf of London	Phyllis Allenby ( June Lockhart , oh how young she is ! ) believes she has her family's supposed curse of lycanthropy when a series of murders occurs in a London park near her mansion estate , where the victims ' throats are mangled . Evidence found at her bedside after she awakens in the morning point towards possible guilt ( . . muddy shoes , wet robe , bloody hands ) but her " aunt " Martha Winthrop ( Sara Haden ) sternly refuses to allow Phyllis to tell anyone . Phyllis ' gentleman caller , Barry Lanfield ( Don Porter ) begins to worry about her when Martha insists she's too ill and uneasy to see him . Meanwhile , Scotland Yard police are searching the park at night for a possible wolf or deranged person prowling for a fresh victim . A sub-plot has Martha's beautiful daughter Carol ( Jan Wiley ) , forbidden by her mother to see a poor artist Dwight Severn ( Martin Kosleck ) , meeting him at night in the very park where possible danger could be waiting . . or could she actually be the wolf-woman killing innocents ? Or , could the curse actually be true regarding Phyllis ' being a she-wolf ? After SY Detective Latham ( Lloyd Corrigan ) is murdered by a woman ( . . whose face is hidden , and growling as he screams ) in the park as the police are combing for any possible prowler , the man hunt will certainly be motivated more than ever before . The film shows Phyllis slowly growing mad with fear and anxiety regarding the possibility of committing those grisly acts in the park and Barry searching for who might be the real culprit . I'll get this out before ranting . . the film has wonderful sets . The park and Allensby mansion are superb set-pieces and director Jean Yarbrough's camera-work and lighting is expertly brought to the screen . Even the acting is decent enough . If this mystery thriller had been retitled and repackaged as a stand-alone film released through Universal completely untied to " The Wolf Man " series , it'd probably come across less a disappointment . But , when you have a title like " She-Wolf of London " and a make-up genius , an extraordinary artist , Jack Pierce , who could've given the audience a female werewolf prowling London park ( how cool would THAT have been ! ) then you can't possibly expect us to not be let down ! How frustrating . . I mean , not even a female werewolf in Phyllis ' nightmares , with how often speaks about them haunting her every night . There's a great tragic romance to be damned that'd been perfectly realized here . . imagine if Phyllis actually was cursed with the malady of lycanthropy with the upcoming marriage to her beloved Barry . Imagine Phyllis ( . . or anyone else for that matter ) turning into a female werewolf in her bed , breaking through her bedroom window , with sharp , snarling teeth and fur pouncing on poor helpless victims . That'd been something to see . Yet , sigh , we get a red herring in a mystery where the murders are committed by a garden tool by someone pretending to be somebody she isn't . So much potential wasted . This film isn't a bad one , but when you have an opportunity to create a she-wolf and Pierce on your payroll then take advantage for chrissake !
436587	9938570	37098	5.0	The Mummy's Curse	" The devil's on the loose and he's dancing with the mummy ! " The mummified one-armed strangler returns as Kharis ( Lon Chaney Jr ) once again seeks his mate , Princess Ananka ( the beautiful Virginia Christine , who rises from the earth in the film's best sequence ) who is reincarnated and listless . Somehow , both Kharis and Ananka find themselves in the bayou of Louisiana after having went into a swamp in New England . . how this possibly could occur is never established . It's been 25 years , and the village folk . . the whole superstitious lot . . are scared senseless of the myth of a bandaged killer and his princess bride . Museum curator James Halsey ( Dennis Moore ) and his assistant Ilzor Zandab ( Peter Coe ) are searching for the remains of Kharis and Ananka for their new museum which drives Pat Walsh ( Addison Richards ) crazy . You see Pat is the foreman behind a great excavation project draining the swamp so that citizens can have a much safer environment to live ( . . and of course opening the door for future businesses to enter in ) , but the workers are worried sick about being killed by the mummy . It doesn't help matters when one of the workers is found with a knife in his back . Later we find that Ilzor is the new High Priest of Arkham , yet another " middle man " who commands his servant lackey Ragheb ( Martin Kosleck ) to feed Tana leave stew to Kharis so that he can find and nab Ananka wherever she may be . A body count escalates as anyone who tries to protect a bewildered Ananka ( suffering a case of amnesia , not knowing exactly who she is ) suffers the suffocating grasp of Kharis . But , what Ilzor doesn't know is that Ragheb will , of course , betray him desiring to take Pat's niece Betty ( Kay Harding ) , a secretary for her uncle who falls in love with Halsey . Where the Egyptian crypts for Kharis and Ananka reside in the ruins of a monastery , where the climax takes place as Ragheb will face those he betrayed . . Ilzor and Kharis as the mummy finally captures Ananka . Will Ragheb be able to control the mummy for himself ? Will Ragheb hurt Betty ? Will Kharis finally return with his bride to Egypt with Ilzor where they belong ? The film has atmosphere to burn and excellent use of shadow as we see the image of the mummy draw near ( also , the film uses the sound of Kharis ' dragging foot to full effect ) , but has a lackluster premise that is essentially Kharis killing people in an alarming rate at a slow speed searching for Ananka , who seems to faint a hell of a lot . Peter Coe as Ilzor is yet another dull block-of-wood in a series of wooden villains who command Kharis to kill . Kosleck is a smallish fiend who isn't that imposing . Christine is fine as the unfortunate princess who has a hard time understanding the horrors swirling around her . But , the film's bread-and-butter is Ananka's rising from the earth burying her . . it's an eerie scene , perfectly chilling , that the film as a whole couldn't accomplish . The curtain closes on a poor , run-of-the-mill , uninspired series .
436098	9938570	63272	5.0	Mantis in Lace	Cheeky smut is perfect entertainment for sleaze aficionados . Photographed by Bogdanovich's frequent cinematographer László Kovács whose experiments with psychedelic colors during Lila's ( Susan Stewart ) drug trips are quite an experience . The film concerns the homicidal tendencies of a stripper triggered by LSD during Lila's sexual confrontations with men in a candle-lit abandoned warehouse for rent . Lila picks up various males for whom she encounters at the club she works , an unusual assortment of men , who have no idea what lies in store for them as they take part in passionate love-making as she succumbs to possible past incidents which re-awaken as the LSD overtakes her senses . After stabbing the men she beds with a screwdriver , Lila chops their bodies up with a cleaver disposing of the corpses in cardboard boxes in the warehouse , leaving them in vacant areas . The film shows two weary detectives pressed into solving the serial killings , this rash of homicides is growing in number and Lila shows no signs of stopping . The acting is obviously sub-par with this dime-store cast of unknown faces and the dialogue leaves anything to be desired . Stewart , in the lead as Lila , is quite beautiful ( . . often bearing her breasts during rather lackluster dance-routines ) yet rather vacuous . The film luridly shows the club crowd's enthusiastic reactions to the performance artists on stage as they bare their breasts for the public . . László Kovács camera gets in very close , his eye-lens peering provocatively as the strippers ' bodies move in various dance routines . This film made me feel like I was a paying customer . . that was how the director and his photographer often focus completely for long periods on the strippers and their routines . This will definitely be embraced by that crowd who adores trash and twisted premises like this film has . There's a soft-core sequence between the club owner that Lila works for and a potential client that seems to be in the film merely to satisfy an audience looking for a sex scene . I wouldn't call this a good film , but I certainly think it achieves what it sets out for . . giving a specific audience exactly what they crave . The abrupt ending leaves anything to be desired .

While away , Lex Luthor was able to get out on appeal for Superman is not there in the court as the key witness to keep him behind bars . When he returns , Superman finds Lois dating another man , Richard , the assistant editor ( and general nice guy ) to Perry White of the Daily Planet . Lois also has a male child which brings to the viewer the possibility of a super-son . Lois claims the boy is Richard's . Superman takes up his crime-fighting ways and saving those in peril . Luther's partner in crime , Kitty Kowalski , helps him out on occasion , but mostly walks nearby his side tossing " witty " quips ( which seems to be one of her only purposes ; we must remember she is played by Parker Posey who has a knack for delivering witty puns ) . Luthor finds the location of where Superman received his father's guidance and instructions through the use of crystals . Luthor takes the crystals and soon finds Kryptonite buried within a rock housed in a museum . He then plans through the use of the crystals , whose power is unimaginable ( they literally can shut an entire city's power down while also growing crystal-shaped rock formations from the watery earth ) , to bury a large part of the United States under water for forming his own land for substantial gain . Will Superman be able to stop Luthor's diabolical plan while also having to save a city on the verge of collapse when the evil bald one sets just a few crystals in the ocean ? This film is a one hour forty five minute movie buried under a running time of two and a half hours . I was expecting fireworks , but said to myself once it was over , " That's it ? " Sure , there are some clever super-saving special effects in the film like how Superman rescues a crew of passengers on the verge of death landing them safely on a baseball diamond or how he is able to fly through clouds ( not to mention how a bullet simply smashes an unphased eyeball of Mr . S ) , but that big climactic wallop just really never comes . The film is more of an introduction to the characters and the casting choices , for the most part , are fine . I was quite surprised at how much Brandon reminded me of Chris Reeve . Even when he speaks , it seems like they have laid a voice-over of Reeve saying goodbye to Lois . I think Kate Bosworth makes a beautiful Lois and Spacey seems to relish his menace in the guise of Luthor . Poor Marsden ( sort of like his Cyclops in the X-Men franchise ) is the unfortunate come-between as Lois ' beau Richard . He is as good as good can be , but he isn't Superman and seems to be in this plot more for being a roadblock for the romance viewers expect from the new film . I found it laughable the way the screenplay finds ways to put Lois in peril and then showing Superman coming to her rescue right on cue . But , the most unfortunate thing is that the confrontation we wait two hours for is short-lived having their encounter brief until the next film . Really , to be brutally honest , the film's story isn't any more thrilling than a Smallville episode . We just have to watch the story develop over an exhausting two and a half hours instead of week to week . Still , despite the film not being that great , I do think now that they've made the characters clear to us , the franchise has opportunities to take off . I will certainly give a second film a chance . . I just hope they don't waste my time for an epic length next time .
436338	9938570	1213856	5.0	Voices	For about 90 minutes , practically everyone around Ga-in ( Jin-seo Yun ) wants her dead . A classmate . A teacher . Her male fencing partner . Her mother . Perhaps even her best friend . But , the very one she wouldn't realize is exactly the person that wishes to kill her the most . A little boy sees his mother topple over with a knife in her back and we later discover that his father went apesh # t due to stress and poverty . This corresponds with Ga-in's family we later discover with the little boy seeking revenge for he blames them mostly for his father's eventual psychotic breakdown . The film also highlights a young man who seems to follow Ga-in around yet no one seems to acknowledge him but her . Ga-in's aunt presumably leaped off a balcony ( . . or was pushed by her fiancé ) and was eventually stabbed to death by her sister as she lie recuperating in a hospital bed . Ga-in later is sent by her father to an elderly man who tells her of a story concerning his decision to murder his wife out of rage towards her adultery . He feels his action , fueled by a voice over the phone who warned him of her adultery , has perhaps set off a chain of events where some sort of curse is running rampant hypnotizing folks into killing people they wish were dead . And , the young man who hangs around with Ga-in , like a little drooping , sad puppy with nowhere else to go , tells her to trust no one , not even herself . Eventually someone Ga-in loves so dear will unleash a fury on her family , her having no idea that he harbors such harsh feelings . There are a lot of hallucinatory scare effects designed to make the viewer jump concerning a monster which resembles red raw hamburger meat in the shape of a man always reaching out to grab Ga-in . She also sees this spooky young women , her face emerging from a pool of dripping blood , hovering over her bed , threatening that Ga-in would be next ( . . this happens after Ga-in's aunt stabs her sister in the hospital room ) . The film seems to establish that a sinister figure representing a symbolic form of harbored desire ( . . the desire one has against another , out of jealousy , mostly ) provides people with an option to violently rid themselves of their " adversary . " Ga-in stands in the way , so to speak , of certain people's happiness . The student who never benefits due to Ga-in's success as a fencer . The teammate who is one step below Ga-in in their sport , wanting her out of the way . The best friend jealous of her attaining the boyfriend she always wanted . The mother who doesn't feel appreciated . But , to be honest , I couldn't understand what happened at the end ( . . Ga-in's fate after a tragic murder of a relative ) regarding Ga-in . I thought I had a decent understanding of what the hell was going on , but , like a lot of these films , the filmmakers involved desperately needed to throw a wild twist at us . . the heroine can't get off that easy can she ? That's how I felt . . we watch this poor girl go through an absolute nightmare for 90 minutes and yet she must not escape . That's the mentality of horror films these days . Still , there's some great moments here and there , but this is quite a confusing experience one must endure in order to enjoy those instances of shock and awe .
435699	9938570	91828	5.0	Raw Deal	A former FBI agent , Mark Kaminsky ( Arnold Schwarzenegger ) is recruited by his mentor , Harry Shannon ( Darren McGavin ) to go undercover , infiltrating a dangerous crime syndicate in Chicago . The operation is unofficial , masterminded by Harry as retribution for his son's murder . . someone inside the FBI told Luigi where an informant was hiding in protected custody . One of Arnie's lesser 80's action vehicles , but still a showcase for violent mayhem . The finale is pretty much a machine gun massacre within a lavish meeting room for the mafioso in a heavily protected headquarters , where Arnie intrudes upon their gathering firing away . Lots of bodies are pulverized by bullets . And , you get a couple of exciting car chases with Arnold given a chance to pummel mobster goons ( . . he even gets to throw men through windows and tables ) . Competent cast includes the aforementioned McGavin as a FBI investigator who desires revenge against mob boss , Luigi Patrovita ( Sam Wanamaker ) and his lieutenant Paulo Rocca ( Paul Shenar ) , with Ed Lauter in support as a detective also assigned to take apart the gangster activity . While Wanamaker and Shenar make colorful heavies , it's Robert Davi , as Rocca's loyal , vigilant , and alert assassin , Max , who has the juicy , scene-stealing part . Steven Hill ( . . known mostly for his work on LAW AND ORDER ) has a field day in his role as an adversary of Luigi's , Martin Lamanski . Max , suspicious of agent Mark right from the start , calls on a sophisticated , glamorous high-class gambler , Monique ( Kathryn Harrold ) to keep an eye on him , with Joe Regalbuto , as district attorney Marvin Baxter , a perfectly weaselly crook actually aiding Luigi in secret . . Baxter is the one who cost Mark his FBI job & provided information for Luigi to find the informant and confiscated drugs / loot . A really nifty robbery is carried out , at the suggestion of Mark no less ( . . the attempt to forge his way into Luigi's trust ) , where Luigi's men successfully heist their coke and drug money , which had been seized by police . But , ultimately , this is an action thriller with Arnie , muscles bulging , carefully stockpiling his weapons and smoking his cigars before beating the crap out of people , or blowing scumbags to kingdom come .
436915	9938570	454970	5.0	Those tourists never learn , do they ?	Dr . Zamora ( Miguel Lunardi ) loves to cut into idiotic tourists and take their organs for hospitals in his third world neck of the woods . This film provides him with some pesky ones who wish not to see their kidneys and heart removed from the bodies while they lie motionless unable to spring from the table . Thankfully , the tourists , who decide to hang down at a beautiful beach for the night instead of awaiting the next available bus ten hours down the road , make a Brazilian friend in Kiko ( Agles Steib ) . Kiko has an uncle he will take them to when they wake up the next day after being drugged and robbed . . it isn't a kindly fellow they hope for but Zamora himself . The place Kiko takes them to ( after carrying them on an exhausting hike through a jungle and inside a waterfall cavernous lair where only portions of air or openings to escape are available . . but come in handy later on ) is Zamora's place of removal . The hero , Alex ( Josh Duhamel ) discovers passports of people which ( like the opening sequence where a victim begs for mercy as the reflection of a man appears in her eye ) could very well be victims of Zamora's handiwork . Unfortunately , Kiko leaves the group in the monstrous hands of Zamora and his henchmen as many are thrown in animal cages awaiting what occurs to one of the them . . the surgical removal of many of her organs ( . . a ghastly scene which shows the removal taking place in exact detail as he informs her why he does this and how much he loathes tourists ) . The rest of the film focuses on if the group can somehow escape the clutches of Zamora and his men with a ridiculous , but harrowing , sequence in a cave where holding your breath ( . . flashlights ) is essential for survival as one of Zamora's men swims after them with an arrow gun ( . . while Zamora and another henchman await the moment they pop their heads up to shoot or secure them ) . The flick is mainly about how characters make one mistake after another because of a situation of their own making . Nooooo , they just couldn't wait for the bus , these tourists just had to find a hot spot to party . If HOSTEL doesn't shy away the tourist trade , TURISTAS will . It's amazing how skilled certain characters are at holding their breath under water while eluding danger in caves that look quite mean when one faces peril . To sum up this film . . at times the flick is quite intense , other times it's quite preposterous , but oftentimes it's both at the same time .
436214	9938570	87130	5.0	Def Con-4	Three astronauts operating an American satellite in space orbiting the globe , carrying a package of warheads , during a turbulent time on Earth as nuclear is a penetrating threat where war is imminent . When an American thermonuclear warhead lands in Russia , supposedly released by terrorists , which doesn't explode , chaos ensues , and the astronauts , faced with the fact that their loved ones and friends will perish , can only look on as the Earth is plunged into worldwide war . Someone from the ground below on Earth , after the nuclear devastation ends with most of the world dead from the nukes landed or dying from radiation in the air , triggers a program which forces the astronauts to land . Landing on a beach , the doctor Jordan ( Kate Lynch ) is knocked unconscious , while Captain Walker ( John Walsch ) is removed from the crash-landed capsule by cannibals which cook him over a fire , as astronaut Howe ( Tim Choate ) tries to find help . Awaiting Howe and Jordan will be a militant group under the command of baby-faced teenager Gideon Hayes ( Kevin King ) who operates a make-shift concentration camp ( . . he was the son of a military man , and successfully survived a helicopter crash , leaving him a broke-backed satellites specialist and girlfriend ) with other school chums as gunmen . With Gideon's lieutenant Lacey ( Jeff Pustil ) , a pathetic goon who relishes his powerful role which puts him in position to bark orders ( . . when in truth he'd be mincemeat if left in this world without such company ) , they take the remaining astronauts hostage , and the rest of the film shows their attempts to break free from his totalitarian grip . We are also shown that , despite most of the warheads having released from the satellite , one has remained lodged in it's chamber counting down to it's explosion time . Maury Chaykin has an amusing role as a filthy civilian named Vinny who , for a time , threatens Howe's life if he doesn't take him to the space capsule full of food , before taken prisoner by Gideon . Lenore Zann is Gideon's Achilles ' heel , ex-girlfriend JJ , for whom he still covets despite her rejections . Amusingly , JJ was Vinny's " prisoner " ( . . but basically , she was using his booby-trapped abode as a hide-out from Gideon ) who attempts to help Howe escape . I enjoyed the opening of the film inside the capsule with our astronauts showing their emotions at what was transpiring on Earth . The last portion of the film , once we enter Gideon's concentration camp , kind of ruins an otherwise interesting premise . . the idea of astronauts crash-landing on a nuclear devastated world . Gideon , played by King who looks all of 17 , as a leader is a bit of a stretch . . it's hard to believe that he , Lacey , or any of these teenage clowns , with ( . . or without ) guns could operate a camp of any kind . Gideon is quite a despicable bastard . . a kid obviously born with a silver spoon in his mouth and the world at his feet ( . . there's one scene where he promises his satellite specialist a cooked steak if he reveals a certain password , going back on his word once getting what he desired ) . But , would such a military brat survive a nuclear devastated world becoming a feared leader over slaves ? Bah , I doubt it . I think the film has it's moments , and certainly isn't the worst movie every made as claimed during the user comments . I found it minimally entertaining , being a sucker for post-apoc sci-fi . . but , it could've been much better with a more believable story ( . . and a more realistic villain ( s ) ) and focused direction . To start so well , and fall so short is a bit disappointing . I truly feel the film would've served better if the story remained centered on the three astronauts and their adapting to a devastated world .
435783	9938570	88889	5.0	Cat's Eye	So-so anthology film with a cat linking the three vignettes . The first features James Woods as the victim of an anti-smoking organization and their disturbing , unorthodox ways of " healing " their clients . The second features Robert Hays as a victim of Kenneth McMillan's nasty millionaire who " offers him a way out " from his debt to him ( Hays also was having an affair with McMillan's wife ) if he can make a complete walk around the ledges of a high-rise . Along the way , McMillan toys with him trying his best to aggravate Hays ' fall . The third , and worst , feature is about some monster in Drew Barrymore's room that sucks her life force and eats her bird . The cat plays a more major role in this particular one for it must stop the monster before it kills Drew . This film really isn't all that scary despite being set in the 80's and having Stephen King's name draped all around it . The first two vignettes have their moments ( wondering if Woods will be able to outlast his hunger to smoke or risk possible harm to his wife thanks to the evil organization's threats ; Hays ' near-falls and revenge on McMillan ) , but the third falls flat to be basking in plain silliness . The film really is only moderately successful . I did like the little in-joke with " Cujo " and getting " The Dead Zone " in there was sneaky . But , the film just doesn't have that many true thrills to ultimately satisfy the true horror fan as this film takes a more psychological approach . The satirical humor of the first film , I believe , makes it my favorite of the three .
435730	9938570	415160	5.0	Minotaur	A monstrous product of a queen and bullgod by a people who desired amorous things , is fed the children of a nearby village ( 8 youths ) every so often . This massive bull , named the Minotaur , with a diseased skeletal look , was caged within a cavernous labyrinthine pit underneath the palace which is now ruled by King Deucalion ( Tony Todd , chewing the scenery as the lecherous villain ) and his sister Queen Raphaella . Sheepherder Theo ( Tom Hardy ) is being groomed by his father Cyrnan ( Rutger Hauer in a glorified cameo ) to become leader of their little village which is often raided by Deucalion of the youth . A wart-infested leper informs Theo that his beloved Ffion ( Donata Janietz ) , who was one of those chosen as meat for the Minotaur , is still alive and that he was destined to be the very man to kill the god . Their village worships the Minotaur as a deity , but Theo believes , thanks to this driven spirit and a strong love for his Ffion , he can kill the beast and will sneak among the chosen to face the music . Among those from the village chosen are loud-mouth Vena ( Fiona Maclaine ) , gruff & tough Tyro ( Lex Shrapnel ) who holds a grudge against Theo for " taking his girl Ffion away from him " , mute Morna ( Maimie McCoy ) , Morna's love and Theo's close friend Danu ( Jonathan Readwin ) , Tyro's love interest Didi ( Lucy Brown ) and quiet Ziko ( James Bradshaw ) who keeps to himself mostly . These are the ones who will be sent into the beast's lair maze to try and survive . Theo will have to somehow guide them through the most difficult situation . In an interesting turn of events , Raphaella hopes that Theo will succeed and opposes her brother Deucalion who wishes for her to bare him a child . She , herself , will enter the monster's lair willing to face whatever obstacles come upon her as a sign of resistance towards Deucalion and what he stands for . Meanwhile , Deucalion will plead with his sister to return even promising the bullgod statue sacrifices of the entire village and infants born for it . Okay little mythical monster movie set centuries ago . . small scale and mostly takes place within the Minotaur's den . A slight bit of graphic violence showing the Minotaur goring victims , but most of the deaths in the film happen off screen . Nothing truly memorable about it , really . May work best for monster movie fans with a Saturday afternoon to spare .
436759	9938570	55391	5.0	Secret of the Red Orchid	The lieutenant of a Chicago crime syndicate shot down by rival gangster boss Kerkie Minelli's ( Eric Pohlmann ) hoods , Gunner Steve ( Klaus Kinski ) sets up new roots in London and is suspected of blackmailing wealthy aristocrats threatening through the use of mailed letters written in block newspaper / magazine clippings not to report to the police or else . Minelli himself , along with his gangster clan , decide to take up residence in London themselves splitting the city in two . Scotland Yard Inspector Weston ( Adrian Hoven ) convinces his superiors to join forces with American ( ! ) FBI agent Captain Allerman ( Christopher Lee ) , a cunning investigator who understands the methods of these Chicago crime families and their history offering a brand of expertise needed to take down these hoodlums who have possibly led to the murder of several wealthy citizens already . But , are these crime families really responsible for the blackmailing and murders of those aristocrats ? Or , are they merely the perfect cover for another schemer ? In an important sub-plot , Lilian Ranger ( Marisa Mell ) watches with her buffoon butler , Parker ( Eddi Aren't , the comedy relief of this crime thriller . . a running gag has him labeled the " death butler " for he winds up under the employ of every single aristocrat murdered by the blackmailing killer ) as her employer , Elias Tanner ( Fritz Rasp ) is gunned down by hoods in his own home passing themselves off as Scotland Yard guards . His bachelor nephew , Edwin ( Pinkas Braun ) , one known for being quite the playboy and ne'er-do-well , comes home supposedly from Brazil to hopefully receive an inheritance from his uncle's will . Edwin is known as an orchid hunter / enthusiast and often drops by to see Lilian , even after he finds out that his uncle has left the entire inheritance to her . Can Edwin be trusted ? Or , is he possibly secretly plotting something ? He always brings a unique orchid for Lilian when he visits her . To be honest , this crime / gangster thriller is only notable for it's cast , particularly Lee and Kinski . But , they can not save themselves from the rather dull plot or the atrocious dubbing which causes one to wince . . whoever was responsible for the voice-work , which is indeed a travesty to listen to , shouldn't have been paid a dime . It's interesting seeing Mell in this before she'd go on to become an icon in Italian cinema . One thing that just drove me bonkers was the way hoods would shoot people and the camera would close in to show that the victims of bullet-fire had no wounds or even a hint of blood . . the effect of Minelli's fate , for instance , is ruined because of a close-up showing not the slightest hint of bodily damage . The film itself is rather a bore , I must admit . But , seeing Lee and Kinski opposite each other , even if for just one scene , is quite a thrill . The film's main mystery is practically ruined by the title !
436243	9938570	81186	5.0	Mother's Day	Three friends ( . . the rat pack ) , old college buddies who now live in different cities coming together once a year for a gathering to get away from their lives , decide to camp in the woods and find themselves in the belly of the beast where a deranged mother and her two equally repulsive sons ( . . who she's training to be perfect serial rapist-murderers ) wish to abuse them in every way possible . Like a lot of other rape-revenge films , the girls strike back at their captors when one of the three dies from her wounds . Mother ( Beatrice Pons , the mother of director Charlie Kaufman and producer Lloyd ) has her boys enacting staged encounters they might use later to innocents on Jackie ( Deborah Luce ) , the vulnerable one of the group , eventually sodomizing and beating her senseless . The other girls , Abbey ( Nancy Hendrickson ) and Trina ( Tiana Pierce ) , are spared this humiliation and agony , for over night at least , while spending their time tied up to exercise equipment knowing that god knows what was happening to their pal , Jackie , in the next room . Freeing themselves from the room , and eventually finding their friend nearly beaten to death , crammed in a dresser drawer , Abbey & Trina try to flee the residence with a battered Jackie in tow . Into the woods , Ike ( Frederick Coffin ) , the more filthy son , with decaying teeth and dead left eye , is sent out to catch the girls . The film follows the remaining two girls and their return to Mother's den , with a sadistic brand of justice to wield against the scum that wronged them . Troma release which at points is wacky , sad , vile , and violent . The film gleefully pokes fun at the two brothers , Ike , & Addley ( Michael McCleery ) who are always willing to please , in regards to brutalizing women , their mother in any way possible . They have the manners of pigs and live like them ( . . Ike even eats out of a slop-bucket ) . Beatrice Pons lets it hang out as the mother who soldiers her kids in the arts of masochism and proper attack techniques . The ultra-violence is at times cheap ( . . such as a beheading which couldn't look more staged ; a television set is used and one can tell that the innards of the thing were removed ) , other times effective such as when an ax stabs into a crotch and Drano is forced down a throat . Even an electric carving knife is used ( . . not shown penetrating flesh , though ) to do damage . The girls are given a little development , with each's lives shown before departing for the camping trip . Their camaraderie is pleasant and fun , which makes the inflicted trauma by mother and her boys rather tragic for such a Troma release . Still despite what transpires , the tone rather ever darkens too much for the filmmakers always try to lighten the movie with twisted humor . Still , this is a legit Troma release , and therefore not for all tastes .
436152	9938570	410650	5.0	Species III	Female , birthed from Henstridge's alien and the alien DNA infected astronaut from the previous film , is close to the most perfect hybrid whose eggs might lend an answer to how to cease the dying half-breed alien species . The half-alien / half-human species , created when the astronaut impregnated human women , have flaws in their DNA and succumb to illnesses and sickness due to their low immunity . Dr . Abbot ( Robert Knepper ) kidnaps " Sara " ( Sunny Mabrey ) , posing as a soldier in the military , before a half-breed could get her . Abbot is a professor who sees the Nobel Prize in the future if he finds the answer to the perfect half-breed species , devoid of the current flaws plaguing them now . He seeks assistance from a gifted student , Dean ( Robin Dunne ) , to help him in collecting data and perfecting their experiments on Sara . Meanwhile , Sara , who has grown to a young , luscious , sexual creature from an infant in a manner of days , seeks a mate , finding none that are worthy of her impregnation due to their sickness . Abbot and Dean always remain in danger as the lethal half-breeds continue their pursuit of Sara and a cure . As with most second sequels and beyond , the premise of the half-breed female sexpot aliens is wearing thin despite rampant nudity by stunningly gorgeous naked bodies . While some of the f / x are effective ( . . such as Henstridge's giving birth to infant Sara , subsequently strangled by a half-breed alien boy's tongue in the truck with her ; a man is split in half by an alien Sara's tongue ; some cool disease-riddled aliens in human form showing nasty flesh wounds developing ) , the budget has certainly dwindled somewhat when compared to the other films . . . such as when Sara murders the college dean which isn't the least bit convincing . Also , the story is smaller scale , removed from the governmental / national / global aspects which enriched the apocalyptic terror , instead taking place almost completely within a university town where college kids reside . . . sure , in dialogue that global terror exists , but in this film , the setting is confined in one significant area . Leads Dunne and Knepper are okay enough , and Mabrey is a babe . Yet , compared to Henstridge , who is almost irreplaceable as the incredibly sexy alien from the previous two installments , Mabrey is also smaller scale . As a sequel to an okay franchise , I have seen worse . And , we at least get to see the alien creature designs again , even if there few and far between .
435771	9938570	78916	5.0	Beyond the Darkness	Spoilers regarding some violent acts in the movie . . Read at your own risk . . " Death has no power to separate us . " Franc ( Kieran Canter ) succumbs to madness when his beloved wife Anna ( Cinzia Monreale ) dies of heart failure . What he doesn't know is that his house-servant Iris ( Franca Stoppi ) , someone who is was supposed to be able to trust , was the one responsible for her demise . . via witchcraft . Franc ( in a very explicit , gory sequence ) digs Anna's body from her grave , and preserves it removing the organs and blood . A female hitchhiker he was stuck with after fixing a flat tire ( she helped herself in the passenger's seat ) discovers what Franc is doing and tries to both flee and attack him in a state of fear and pays the ultimate price . Scratching his neck , Franc retaliates by plucking out her fingernails followed by death through suffocation . Iris finds Franc stuck in a difficult situation and assists him ! We find that Iris wishes to become his new wife and will help him get rid of the dead hitcher's corpse ( in another of many grisly scenes , Iris only too happily chops the body up dumping the pieces in a bathtub of acid ) . Another female victim is claimed later as Franc picks up a female jogger training for a race . You see Franc keeps his Anna's preserved corpse in their former bedroom and imagine the shock of a sexually willing jogger getting a glimpse of that as the man she's about to sleep with carries on without a flinch . Biting his hand , she receives a chunk of her throat pulled out by Franc's teeth as he devours the flesh ! Iris again steps in to assist him by burning the corpse in their incinerator in the basement . But , you have to question how long this union between to obvious wackos can last . A snooping man , who works for a priest in charge of keeping Anna's grave-site undamaged , begins to circulate around Franc's humble abode . . will he discover the truth ? Disgusting , unflinchingly gruesome tale lives up to it's reputation mightily . It'll take individuals with strong stomachs to watch it . The flick is directed seriously with no winking , but the twist at the end regarding Anna's surprise relative seems pulled out a hat . . it just seems a bit too much after seeing what we have for 85 minutes . As a gore film it succeeds . . but the flick is tasteless and especially morbidly sick . The flick's theme is about how obsession can cause people to do strange and bizarre things .
436762	9938570	64393	5.0	The Green Slime	The Class-Two asteroid Flora is on a collision course for earth and Commander Jack Rankin ( Robetrt Horton ) must take over operations of the space station Gamma Three from unproven Commander Vince Elliot ( character actor Richard Jaeckel ) . . they will use a cruiser on the Gamma Three to land on Flora to detonate it before it can reach earth . They have 10 hours and immediately head for Flora and indeed accomplish their goal . What they do not expect is a second , and just as deadly , threat . . green slime that , when feeding from energy , evolve into tentacled blob monsters with a big red eye ( . . with multiple collections of eyes underneath ) and crab claw hands ! These monsters electrocute their prey on instant contact resulting in immediate death . Using laser weapons on these creatures is oblivious because the green blood that releases from their wounds evolve into monsters themselves when contacting any form of energy ! And , the monsters that bleed can heal themselves ! Chief medical physician , Dr . Lisa Benson ( foxy red-head Luciana Paluzzi ) comes between Jack ( her former flame ) and Vince ( her current flame and fiancé ) resulting in a love triangle of galactic proportions ( . . well , maybe I'm exaggerating just a bit for effect ) . A past mission where Elliot made an order against Jack's wishes resulting in many dead officers over one has put a bit of tension that remains throughout until the gung-ho final battle against the monsters at the end . Ever present is the love triangle which causes friction and an un-needed problem when trying to focus on how to kill these alien slime bastards . Quarantining the space station , Jack and company will exhaust every feasible option available before contemplating the most terrible one . . exploding the space station before it can , like the asteroid before , threaten earth . The film's budget is low , relying heavily on models ( mainly the space vehicles and station ) and the sets are designed like something out of Classic Star Trek . The film's cheap look might appeal and charm those who enjoy this type of movie . The sequence on the asteroid looks like some back-lot sound-stage . The rubber-suited monstrosities , with waving tentacles ( you might be inspired to cry , " Warning ! Warning ! " ) and screeching are right out of the Godzilla creature factory . In other words , the film is cheap so many viewers judging harshly will not like it . Director Kinji Fukasaku ( Battle Royale ) implements a claustrophobic style using zoom lens often keeping his camera close to the action and faces of the actors / actresses . He also keeps his camera moving with the action such as when the crew try to keep the monsters at bay or have to move with them throughout the space station . You know this feels like a Japanese creature feature merely replacing the typical Japanese cast with an American one .
436069	9938570	330634	6.0	Mimic III : Sentinel	Marvin ( Karl Geary ) is one of the last remaining persons to have contacted an illness called Strickler's which derived from " diseased " roaches . He is pretty much confined to his room where he keeps a camera pointed constantly across the street at his neighbors ' open windows gazing into their lives since his has been put on hold . His condition is so bad , if a woman , such as his later love-interest , a dentist's assistant , Carmen ( Rebecca Mader ) comes near him with perfume he requires oxygen or he'll go into an asthmatic fit . Even if he smells the afterlife of smoke , like from Carmen who had just finished a cigarette prior to entering his room , the shock kicks in with him darting for his oxygen tank . Occasionally , he journeys out of his room , but not without his tank and only for minutes not wishing to risk his health . His sister , Rosy ( Alexis Dziena ) is an addict who notices her brother's interest in Carmen . Rosy likes to poke fun at Marvin's hobby and often struggles with the need to get high . . she is always on edge and squirrelly . His mother Simone ( Amanda Plummer ) has a new love in her life , a beat cop Gary Dumars ( John Kapelos ) who pretends , at first , of being a detective . He's called in when Marvin and Rosy believe they saw a drug dealer , Des ( Keith Robinson ) killed by the " garbageman " , a dark , conspicuous character with bags on his feet whose face they have a hard time seeing . Also , Marvin keeps tabs on a father and son , whose relationship descends as the other son of the family ( seen at the beginning killed by the cockroach killer ) remains missing . Soon , the person they believed was the garbageman ( Lance Henriksen ) committing the murder of Des , shows his face when he finds Rosy and Carmen in his apartment ( they decide to see what's up with him while also searching for possible evidence regarding Des ' death ) . This man has something padlocked in his freezer . . and it could be something relative to the cockroach creatures which show up to kill various victims on the streets at the wrong time , including Dumars out searching for anyone suspicious . As many have already mentioned , the film uses the idea from Hitchcock's " Rear Window " that a helpless peeper has to watch helplessly as others he loves walk into possible peril . He often struggles for air when simply moving some in his room , so his assisting those in need of help when facing giant bugs with claws that stab the torso repeatedly and have wings which flap incessantly is rather limited . The film plays with what Marvin sees and , especially , what he doesn't . JT Petty adopts a little trick with the camera to let we , the viewers ( who are essentially peepers ourselves if you think about it ) see other poor apartment dwellers being killed by the giant winged cockroaches through the lens while Marvin is away from it . We see the things responsible for the slayings , but such as Marvin , the viewers can not help anyone either . . . so , we , in a sense , are helpless on-lookers to peril . I like this idea and think it's the most positive aspect to the flick . But , in all honesty , there's not much story here , other than the poor soul with Strickler's trying to find a way to help his loved ones who seem unable to escape the horror that awaits them . Sadly , I found Henriksen's character a little murky . . his motives were open to a point , but I wanted more about him . The killer bugs themselves are only revealed at the end when they attack certain individuals . . these attacks deliver the goods in how they speedily thrust the victims before they even have a chance to scream . In the film , Henriksen tells us that the things which lie in his freezer are breeding underground , so I'm guessing there are more sequels to explore a possible outbreak . This flick surrounds a few characters near an apartment complex staying away from what's been occurring to civilization as a whole .
436713	9938570	86014	6.0	Nightmares	Four tales with no wraparound story titled TERROR IN TOPANGA , BISHOP OF BATTLE , THE BENEDICTION , & NIGHT OF THE RAT inside a movie structure consecutively . The first is about a housewife who , despite her husband's warnings to stay in because of an escaped loony who murdered a police officer with a knife , goes out for a pack of cigarettes . Guess who she perhaps bumps into when she unfortunately runs out of gas ? This one has a nice build-up , but goes absolutely nowhere which is a shame because it has lots of potential . . it simply lacked inspiration by the writer . The second tale is about an obsessive arcade nerd who just can't rest until he reaches the prestigious Level 13 of a very difficult game called " The Bishop of Battle " . When he does , he's thrusted into a new kind of game where the stakes are his very life . To be honest , this one was a bit hokey . . the result when he reaches 13 I mean . My favorite of the anthology has a Priest ( Lance Henriksen , with conviction ) , who has lost his faith because of the frequent human suffering he sees on a regular basis , being terrorized by a psychopathic trucker , whose face is never revealed thanks to darkened tinting on the windows . We do get an indication who the driver might be . . an upside down crucifix is hanging from the rear-view mirror . And , the weapon the Priest uses against the trucker also is telling in perhaps who this evil driver is . Tense , well developed little episode with little spiritual elements which aren't too heavy-handed which is a plus . An unhappily married couple ( Richard Masur and Veronica Cartwright ) have a MAJOR rat problem . Their house cat finds that out first hand . It has been leaving a path of destruction throughout their house yet the husband wishes to fix the rat problem on his own without paying someone else . The wife , having had enough of her kitchen being demolished , calls a specialist ( Albert Kague ) and after studying comes to the conclusion that this big rat might be a Devil Rodent , the type from ancient German myth . He says they are indestructible . I know one thing , as presented here , when it lets out a roar it must measure on the Richter scale . The final scene where the couple come face to face with it might be a little too cheesy to fully scare , but I feel the episode overall works quite well . None of the stories can claim complete originality , but the last two , I believe , are thrilling & creepy enough to rise this anthology as a whole slightly above mediocrity .
435892	9938570	180274	6.0	Unhinged	Three teenage girls , traveling to a rock festival , find themselves trapped in the castle of a mother and her dutiful daughter , after their car hits a log in the country road they've managed to get lost on . With rain-swept roads unable to drive on , the girls must wait out the time in the house , opting for finding a way out of the castle for their hosts are a bit creepy . . and the thoughts of remaining in such a repressed environment where the mother is always blasting her daughter for being such a disappointment , while also establishing her hate of men , is a bit of a drag . They will , however , come in contact with a killer who is behind a rash of female disappearances in the woods near the castle . Here we go . . an Oregonian slasher flick , made by folks from the state , in Portland at a creepy mansion , utilized well by director Don Gronquist , whose influences of such films as " Halloween " , " Texas Chainsaw Massacre " & " Psycho " are undeniable . Don't let the whole " BANNED IN THE UK " fool you . . this slasher flick isn't really that gory . Sure blood sprays from off-screen slashing ( . . one is murdered with a scythe , another with an ax , and the good old machete does some damage as well ) , but most of the gruesome violence isn't shown . I think the film benefits most from the uneasy dinner table scenes between Terry ( Laurel Munson ) , a nineteen year old early 80's teen and the two " women " of the house she's stuck with , from another time living in the past . The house itself , whose lavish grounds are buried deep within the mountains cut completely off from society with a paid ground keeper doing their chores and bringing in supplies when they need them , carries the appearance of a castle from many years past where the regal wealthy would have their tea parties , and pomposity filled the room . Certainly the senile , loony crippled matriarch , Mrs . Penrose ( Virginia Settle , showing her character teetering on the brink of insanity , snapping back into reality to insult her " daughter " some more for having men around the house behind her back ) reflects the atmosphere of the home . . she too is cut of from the modern age , still living in the past . Janet Penner , as the tormented spinster daughter Marion , portrays her as polite and controlled , surprising under the circumstances she finds herself . You can not help but wonder when such a person is bound to snap , after bearing the weight and burdens of such an overbearing and mentally troubled mother . Then you have the wacky brother roaming the grounds , wondering if he is the one behind the murders of Terry's pals . We're not sure , until the very final scene , whether or not it is he who is the person whose eyeball peeps through a hole in the wall spying on the girls when they are either bathing or talking to one another . Through the heavy use of a synth score , director Gronquist builds the dread , while also , through the secretive Marion , revealing little secrets along the way . The film's low budget , at times , can be a liability . Sometimes the picture is too dark , and the cast show their uneven acting ability , although Munson , and Sara Ansley ( . . as Terry's friend Nancy , the " evil influence " her mother was worried about ) aren't afraid to get naked . I noticed Gronquist shies away from conversations between the female teenagers , perhaps recognizing a limited ability to project the type of " high schooler banter " needed when these types of girls speak . I think the film's greatest strength is the awkward situation the girls find themselves in , amongst such relics from a time they have no knowledge ( . . although Terry does mention that the mother reminded her of a senile grandmother ) , there's an unpleasant discomfort I thought worked wonderfully . The twist at the end can be realized much sooner if one is paying attention to a certain photograph found in an upstairs room by Terry . And , the twist echoes " Psycho " quite a bit , as does the overall thematic elements of a mother's emotional state effecting her child . I think if one can look past the director's ( . . and film's ) limitations , there's an eerie quality the film has . . or , at least , the flick gripped me : being closed off from help , caught in a place where disturbed people live , with a wilderness outside housing possible terror . Do remember that the film shows signs of an amateur filmmaker , for there are needlessly long stretches of helicopter shots of the girls ' car driving down the road , and fade-to-blacks that last too long . There's a much tighter film that could've been produced that would've made this film feel less tedious .
435840	9938570	83146	6.0	Sweet 16	Bo Hopkins stars as a small town sheriff , Dan Burke , trying to uncover the one responsible for a series of murders towards young men surrounding fifteen year old Melissa Morgan ( Aleisa Shirley ) whose " sweet sixteen " is approaching . A number of suspects emerge including two Native Americans , elderly Greyfeather ( Henry Wilcoxon ) and his grandson , Jason Longshadow ( Don Shanks ) , but they could be smokescreens of another , whose long buried past has awakened and those who attempt to get involved with Melissa pay the price . Susan Strasberg ( . . still quite beautiful at this time ) is Melissa's mother , Joanne , and screen veteran Patrick Macnee is her father , archaeologist Dr . John Morgan , excavating old Indian grounds for artifacts . Don Stroud is a rowdy racist cowboy , Billy Franklin , often hanging around with goofy hoodlum , Jimmy ( Logan Clarke ) teasing and abusing Greyfeather when he enters their juke joint for a beer . Billy and Longshadow are mortal enemies and a destined showdown is imminent . Dana Kimmell is Dan's inquisitive daughter Marci and Steve Antin is his son Hank , whose attraction to Melissa puts him in potential danger . The horror escalates at Melissa's sweet sixteen birthday party , put together as a way for the town to meet the Morgan family . . the killer will be revealed and Billy , along with Jimmy ( . . his shadow , pretty much ) will attempt to have a little fun with Melissa when she goes skinny dipping with Hank . The film carves a psychological path as Dan soon discovers the history of a certain character whose traumatic past could have developed a disturbed personality willing to kill those who pose a fictional danger to Melissa who represents someone else symbolically . The director , Jim Sotos , mentions that they were working from an unfinished script , during an interview with Hopkins admitting to ab-libbing some lines ( . . and a funny story mentions how Macnee was confused with the twist regarding why the killer was committing such grisly knife murders ) . Aleisa Shirley , a very pretty girl , has some nude shower sequences that left me rather disoriented . . as a fifteen year old character , I didn't know whether to be mortified as the camera embraced her naked flesh , or jovial because it's obvious she was a much older woman than the Melissa she was portraying . Sharon Farrell has a nice supporting role as Kathy Hopkins , a forensics expert carrying a torch for widower Dan , who proposes marriage to him all the time . A great asset to the movie was the camaraderie between Hopkins and his fictional family , Kimmell and Antin . . their chemistry together is quite fundamental to the overall success of this rural slasher . They will become embroiled within the developing situation just as much as their father investigating the case , just in a different way . Fans of Macnee will be rather disappointed in his rather lackluster role here . . it's nice to see him , but not much is demanded from him since the character isn't too strongly involved within the major plot . Strasberg , however , has an interesting development since it's revealed that she was born in the town setting of this movie . . and has friction with Michael Pataki's citizen , George Martin , an obvious history between these two is apparent . The violence isn't too gruesome , with carefully edited attacks showing the knife stabbing torsos up close . . not that extreme for dye-in-the-wool slasher fans used to gratuitous gore . Hopkins is as appealing and laid back as ever , a dominating presence of the plot , his authority convincing in a small town atmosphere , dealing with confrontational cases appropriately and realistically . I particularly liked how his sheriff handles his kids who respect their father , even if they disobey him sometimes . . unlike today's children who resist parental guidance , Dan's children know their place and don't cross him . Kimmell , who would go on to star as the lead final girl in Friday THE 13TH III , is adorable , always studiously involved in dad Dan's cases .
436363	9938570	74258	6.0	Burnt Offerings	Hokey haunted house flick regarding a family who moves into a large mansion for the summer strangely paying for it rather cheaply . The Allardyces ( Burgess Meredith , wearing his usual demented grin , and Eileen Heckart ) talk to the Rolf family regarding the house as if it were a living breathing human being . For instance when Marian ( Karen Black ) and Ben ( Oliver Reed , who gets so intense sometimes I was afraid his eyes would pop out of their sockets ) mention the idea of keeping the house clean without hired help , Mrs . Allardyce says that it cleans itself . Okay . The Allardyces also have a stipulation . . they supposedly have their mother in a room up stairs who wishes to be undisturbed . . all they want Marian to do is leave a tray of food for her . The Rolfs bring along Auntie ( Bette Davis , not really in the flick much ) and son David ( Lee Montgomery who is quite a screamer ) and as soon as the family move in weird occurrences kick in . Ben , for some reason , almost drowns David as if , out of the blue , a madness takes over willing him to murder his son . Marian begins to metamorphose into a different person . . a developing infatuation and obsession with the house overwhelms her . And , Auntie , so full of vibrant life at the opening of the film , begins to worsen both physically and mentally . She was quite aware and energetic . . but slowly goes senile and old the longer she remains in that house . And , poor David is privy to the ordeals that strike his family , yet something wishes him harm . . someone locked the window and door to his room with heater gas cut on almost killing him ! And , who is actually in that room upstairs , if anyone at all ? The mystery at the heart of the film is what's wrong with Marian and why does she get nervous when anyone wishes to speak to Mama Allardyce . . what is she hiding ? Despite some disturbing , creepy elements ( Ben being haunted by the image of a ghostly chauffeur with an ominous grin , Auntie's worsening condition , Marian's slow transformation into a completely different person than she was before , etc ) the film falls flat with an ending that's laughable . It's not really that scary despite director Dan Curtis ' best efforts using a soft focus lens inside the house to give it a unique look and some eerie music in the background . The premise , about a house who perhaps lives off of those who stay in it , just seemed rather silly to me . The ending , where we see what was in that secret , locked room , doesn't pack the punch it's supposed to , but right the opposite . . it's an eye-rolling howler ( . . though , it's certainly a downbeat ending ) . Sadly , I think this flick works best as enjoyable camp . . not the intention I believe Curtis was going for .
436755	9938570	85125	6.0	2019 : After the Fall of New York	America , now a desolate wasteland from nuclear warfare that has left the remaining survivors of mankind infertile , yields two warring factions both seeking the answer for the plight of a dying race . The villains of this film are the Eurac corporation , experimenting on test subjects they pluck from the city of New York , hoping to find the answer to birthing a new nation on their own corrupt terms . Most of the Euracs dress like imitation Star Wars Storm Troopers , perhaps representing a Communist regime , setting up outposts and booby traps towards anyone getting in or out of New York . A desert racer , Parsifal ( Michael Sopkiw , playing a more sympathetic version of Snake Plisskin , except donning a bandanna instead of an eye-patch ) , is taken to a top secret outpost in Alaska against his will and asked by the hidden President of the United States to seek out a fertile female housed somewhere within the ruins of a ravaged New York City , buried under rubble and filth . Parsifal once worked under his command in the Pan American Federation , and now the President hopes to start a new race on another world , not corrupted with radiation or war , Alpha Centuri , and promises Parsifal a seat on the ship heading off of Earth if he fulfills the mission by finding the young woman and getting her to them . Along with two assigned operatives to accompany him , a secret cyborg with a rag covering his robotic eye ( . . quite a wiz when using his stringed set of steel balls often knocking his foes out ) and a hook-handed " human map " ( . . who lost his family to the evil Euracs and knows New York City better than just about anyone ) , Parsifal will attempt to infiltrate New York City , preferably the damaged Manhattan , to find the fertile woman . In his way are sewer crazies ( whose head is a nutty Asian played by Hal Yamanouchi ) who hunt rats as a food source , the prowling Eurac soldiers on horseback , and ape-men lead by the gargantuan Big Ape ( George Eastman ) . Luckily Parcifal will find an ally in a dwarf named Shorty ( Louis Ecclesia ) who knows the location of the fertile woman , but also runs into trouble with the bald Eurac Commandant ( Serge Feuillard ) and his lieutenant Ania ( Anna Kanakis ) . Parcifal also finds a love-interest in Giara ( Valentine Monnier ) , thought , at first , to be the fertile woman sought found wandering with the sewer , rat hunting pack . Plucking ideas from multiple sci-actioners , this post-apocalyptic tale , from director Sergio Martino ( . . far removed from his 70's giallo heyday ) moves along at a quickened pace , set to a cool rhythmic beat . Models are used for large shots of New York City and space ships . The outfits used to clothe the characters are mismatched scraps of this and that providing them with a hobo look ( . . or what I like to call , " junk-garb " ) while the Eurac officers often wear matching suits representing a type of totalitarian order dictating the kind of police state they're hoping to employ to the destroyed world ( . . which is perhaps why their purpose for gaining control over the fertile woman is essential ) . The heroes embark on their mission through flooded sewers , often containing red-eyed flesh-eating rats , bus-graveyards , and underground dwelling places for those with radiation burns , trying to hide from the Euracs . Good fun for non-discriminating viewers who accept the film's relatively low budget , burdened with rather cheap special effects , where the filmmakers try to bring to life an ambitious equivalent to films like " Escape from New York " and " Mad Max " . There's no doubt where " 2019 " gets it's inspirations from . . some scenes are directly aping near-exact moments from the aforementioned ESCAPE ( . . such as when Parsifal is stabbed in the leg , in practically the same spot as Snake Plisskin , or how both heroes face off with their foes , carrying a motley group of misfits ) . . but Martino knows how to add zing and zang to action scenes . The camera moves with the characters really well , taking off like a galloping horse during chases and hand-to-hand combats between our heroes and the Euracian forces . " Animal lovers " might take offense to the ways the sewer crazies hunt their rats . Only real problem I had was an abandoned plot resolution regarding Ania , who had taken control of the Euracian forces , yet you never see her again once she claims to take matters into her own hands regarding Parsifal .

Can he outlast the tormenting of Freddy or succumb to the nightmare monster ? Somewhat halted by the television medium , director Tobe Hooper tries camera tricks to make up for being restricted . .

436056	9938570	81184	6.0	Meat's meat and man's gotta eat !	Vincent ( Rory Calhoun , looks like just a good ole boy , but something sinister hides under those supposed kind eyes ) has the finest , most renowned meats in the county . Everyone loves that meat . Vincent is only so glad to furnish his crowd with what they believe is ham , but they have no idea of what they are really munching down on with glee . Vincent and his large sister Ida ( Nancy Parsons ) really put a lot of work and joy into their meat business . They feel they are not only supplying their community but doing a little part for the man upstairs . Well , that secret ingredient for Vincent and Ida's renowned meat is . . human flesh ! Oh , but Vincent feels he's justifiably doing a favor for God by replenishing his customers with human meat . Ida justifies their actions by following her mantra of , " Somebody's got to take responsibility for the planet . " Vincent also feels that there's too many people in the world and not enough food . And , Vincent sure enjoys setting up traps to catch his human meat . We watch as unwary travellers driving down the wrong highway run across bear traps and shotgun bullets piercing their tires . They then take the human beings they catch , bury their bodies up to the neck in fertile soil , sever the vocal chords so that they can only gurgle without being able to cry for help , and await certain doom . If the victims are lucky , Vincent and Ida might snap their necks . One mistake Vincent makes is taking the very sexy Terry ( Nina Axelrod . . interesting name considering it might describe a situation for a lot of males as they see her rack ) into their home . . while " planting " her boyfriend , who she is told is dead and buried , in the human meat garden . Sheriff Bruce Smith ( Paul Linke ) is the black sheep of the family as he doesn't understand that his brother and sister are cooking human flesh for jerky . Will anyone stop Vincent and Ida's dastardly deeds ? This is one sick puppy . Tongue definitely in cheek . How's this for casting . . Wolfman Jack plays a reverend ! And , John Ratzenberger ( you know Cliff the mailman on Cheers ) plays a heavy metal rocker who gets planted in the meat garden ! !
436295	9938570	51630	6.0	Frankenstein-1970	Baron Victor von Frankenstein ( Boris Karloff playing him mostly devious and wickedly amoral . . he adheres to no one's needs but his own ) is the last in the family line donning a scar on one side of his face ( drooping the eyelid ) and plagued with a lurch due to his torture at the hands of the Nazis . He wishes to carry out his great-great grandfather's legacy of giving re-birth to a preserved man-monster in his secret laboratory hidden within what seems to be a mausoleum . He has sold his family's expensive paintings to finance his machines and equipment , but in the desire to acquire an atomic reactor ( ! ) he must allow a film crew to shoot in and around his castle , quietly detesting them with every aching bone left in his body . In this film the film crew director , an energetic , unflappable Douglas Roe ( Don Barry ) will be delivering the atomic reactor himself as a promise for utilizing Baron's castle for atmospheric purposes . Now , how a film director can acquire an atomic reactor is anybody's guess . But , a minor squabble . Baron needs vital parts to bring his monster to life and gets jump-started when his butler Schutter ( a very hammy Norbert Schiller ) goes nosing around eventually finding out about the laboratory experiments and the secret location . Schutter's brain will be used ( as well as his heart among other parts ) , but Baron drops the jar with liquid-doused eyes splashing on the floor . He'll need a correct pair of eyes and focuses on taking Roe's . But , his eyeless monster will often kill members of the film crew causing Baron much strife in having to find avenues of escape regarding where the missing people have went off to . His cunning will eventually fail as his monster , often obeying Baron's voice , begins to operate on his own with the predictable results . To me , the film's main strength is Karloff's Baron . . an emotionally scarred wreck , having grown quite mad with an unstoppable demented desire to bring his monster to life by any means necessary . But , it was agonizing for me , being such a lover ( . . and fan ) of Karloff's work to see him in such frail shape obviously trying his best to mask the agony that is apparent when he attempts to just walk . Many are critical of Karloff here deeming him merely as hammy , but I reveled at seeing him playing Herr Baron concocting his schemes , playing his eerie organ , & working so passionately in his laboratory preparing for his creation's birth . Seeing him guiding the monster was entertaining as well because it brought back memories of the Universal classics with mad scientists ordering their monsters to collect victims for their experiments . Those that portray the film crew are not very interesting and aren't given much to do for the exception of being fodder for Frankenstein . But , sadly , the film is slowly paced and often dull . . it lacks the energy and enthusiasm of the films it is trying to emulate . The whole show is Boris . . his dialogue around a sheeted corpse doting aloud of his Frankenstein family is the highlight in my opinion .
435961	9938570	51682	6.0	The Living Coffin	The remaining few citizens of a sleepy Mexican hacienda fear the restless spirit of a woman who lost her children in quicksand . A knife is buried in a grandfather clock's face at the direct moment this woman died . To keep her from returning to plague the town even more , the knife remains until the niece , María ( María Duval ) of the dead woman's sister , Aunt Doña María ( Hortensia Santoveña ) plucks it out releasing possible terror on them all . María's intentions were to free her very superstitious , guilt-stricken aunt ( . . she blames herself for allowing her sister's children to play outside where they fell into the quicksand while her back was turned ) of the anguish grieving her . A marshal ( Gastón Santos ) and his sleepy deputy , Coyote Loco ( Pedro de Aguillón ) happen to seek info on a small statue made by the woman whose death still culminates , like a thundercloud , on the township . What they encounter is murders to the hacienda's emotionally wounded alcoholic doctor ( Antonio Raxel ) who was still saddened by the loss of the weeping woman for whom he was to marry and Doña María , by a mysterious woman , with a ghastly complexion and sharpened claws which rip the faces of those she strangles , who removed herself from a tomb once María pulled the knife from the clock . But , our marshal believes that , in fact , there are mortals behind the murders and will stop at nothing to diminish the gloomy atmosphere of a hacienda riddled with fear , bringing a murderer to justice . We see towards the opening of the film that someone , in the bushes , shot Doña María's hired help in the back near the swamp where the quicksand is located and perhaps the restless spirit of the weeping woman wanders still mourning the loss of her children . Being a Casa Negra release , I was anticipating a Gothic western with supernatural overtones . Instead , director Fernando Méndez's film plays more like a western serial with shoot-outs , a bar fight , and even horse tricks ( . . like one scene where the marshal's rescued from the quicksand thanks to his horse bringing rope to his aid ; the horse also makes discoveries which assist it's master ) . Despite the appearances of a Gothic terror tale regarding a ghost haunting the inhabitants of a once thriving community , it's instead a western where the marshal , pretty much a cowboy sleuth with Alan Ladd matinée idol looks , cracks down on corruption regarding the ownership of the hacienda and a mine containing gold . There's a reason why he's interested in finding out more about the stone statue , depicting a weeping female , carved out of gold . Pedro de Aguillón , as the marshal's sidekick always looking for a bed to sleep on , is a bumbling clown , used for comedy relief as the film builds to the climax . " The Living Coffin " , in my mind ( . . and to other Casa Negra fans it seems ) , is a second tier release next to the upper echelon of films such as " Black Pit of Dr . M " , " Curse of the Crying Woman " & " The Witch's Mirror " , but I still recommend it . The fisticuffs are a bit flawed , but the film has it's moments such as when the murderess attacks her victims , and there are some neat little secret passageways and red herrings to keep mystery fans interested . I can't help feeling a bit disappointed that " The Living Coffin " doesn't pursue the supernatural elements , because the Weeping Woman myth sure excited me a bit . And , the idea that a restless spirit , which carries the appearance of an insane witch , is killing folks in a hacienda sure seems like a " can't miss " . The short length is a blessing in disguise , though , and the film doesn't outstay it's welcome . I would just suggest to Gothic horror fans hoping for another " Black Pit " from director Mendez , to keep their expectations low . He was aiming for the western / mystery crowd with this one .
436671	9938570	280969	6.0	My Little Eye	Five young adults from various backgrounds accept an invitation to star in a reality show for a hefty sum if they , as a collective , can remain together for a specific length of time . What they do not know is that they are actually part of a secret internet based " snuff-game " recorded for wealthy clients betting on who will survive to the end . Also , one amongst the group isn't the innocent he / she appears to be . . Gimmicky concept was kind of hip around the late 90's / early millennium thanks to " camera films " like " The Last Broadcast " and " The Bliar Witch Project . " I found " My LIttle Eye " entertaining , with how the group slowly comes apart at the seams as unpredictable occurrences begin to unravel the group . Those mysterious masterminds who have created this reality show with their mice trapped in a maze as voyeuristic eyes gaze on them from their computer monitors , a select few with the financial means and morbid taste for this kind of " entertainment . " Essentially these five people are mice , with cameras hidden everywhere , from shower heads to ball point pens . There are no avenues of escape from prying eyes , even in their supposed " reality safe zone " where cameras are not supposed to intrude , the subjects of this game find no breaks . I think the idea of having the whole film shot through hidden cameras rather ingenious , and commend the filmmakers for what had to be a difficult process , particularly in the editing room . Pretty sure a lot of footage was shot , from various angles often on one particular person . I'm not sure the climax , where a policeman shows up as the killer is after the " final girl " , actually works , but overall I found this horror spoof of reality television rather satisfying . Others may not . The acting and characters are adequate , but I think the gimmick is the showcase here . . and this may very well be what turns many away .
436309	9938570	457275	7.0	Altered	Cody , Duke & Otis ( Paul McCarthy-Boyington , Brad William Henke & Michael Williams ) " capture " an alien they supposedly injured to the home of Wyatt ( Adam Kaufman ) . At first , we really don't know what's going on , but find as the characters converge that these young men were all victims of " alien testing " and Wyatt seems to be the token human who was able to outlast the experiments done to him . A dead friend's memory haunts the group as Cody was recently released from the pin for the wrongfully accused death of his brother Timmy . They take pride in capturing the alien , but have no idea that this was all a plan by the aliens to find the whereabouts of Wyatt for whom had been planted with a tracking device he had removed so that he could hide from them . So , the group will have to keep the alien silenced without killing it or risk the race of ET's exterminating the earth . Other problems that emerge . . Wyatt's girlfriend , Foki ( Misty Rosas ) who wants to get away and call the police and a sheriff who answers the call of 911 , Henderson ( James Gammon ) . We learn that if an alien bites you , a type of flesh-eating disease takes hold of the body and that Wyatt seems to have an immunity to it . One of the best " aliens attack " horror / sci-fi hybrids I've seen in ages . It's mostly confined to Wyatt's home as they fight to keep the alien trapped and quiet ( it has it's own tracking device implanted for which Wyatt will remove ) . Cody is unhinged because of being blamed for his brother's murder and holds Wyatt specifically responsible . The film amazingly remains intense because of the alien threat and surprisingly the creature is quite well created by the filmmakers . And , even more stunning is how director Eduardo Sánchez ( of BLAIR WITCH PROJECT fame ) uses dialogue to suggest what happened to these guys instead of showing flashbacks . . this saves a good amount of money , yet elaborates for us what these aliens did . The film has some gory make-up work as it pertains to the nasty flesh-eating disease that attacks one of the group who is bit by the captive alien .

He uses their children as a means to destroy them . It's up to the son of Mr . Paxton , Paul ( Anthony Higgins ) , to stop him . Dracula cunningly is using young virginal Alice ( Linda Hayden , who is wonderfully endowed ) , Paul's squeeze , as his main manipulative tool to wreak vengeance . As he kills each man , he whispers their number until all three are silenced . This film really suffers because of Lee's lack of screen time . It's got a decent cast who puts forth an effort , but there seems to be missing something from this film . It takes a bit too long to get going , but Lee's Dracula is worth the wait even if we get just fifteen or so minutes of his sinister vampire . The film's certainly not hurting in the style department or period setting , the film still has wonderful atmosphere , but perhaps having us wait so long for the star of the film takes much away from this film .
436665	9938570	83660	7.0	Blood Song	A lunatic , who watched his father shoot down his mother and her adulterous lover before putting a bullet in his mouth , escapes from a mental asylum after a sneak attack on his doctor who was attempting to retrieve a wooden flute , terrorizing an innocent teenager with a wounded leg who catches him attempting to bury a dead body . As Paul ( Frankie Avalon , in a startlingly effective performance ) was digging a burial spot for a woman he had recently strangled , troubled teenager , Marion ( Donna Wilkes ) stumbles upon him in the act . This confrontation was seemingly fated to happen because , strange enough , Marion had been having unpleasant visions / nightmares of Paul and his acts towards people along the way . . blood transfusions or not , the idea of being linked to someone mainly due to that is kind of feeble at best . Paul had buried a hatchet into the face of a driver who gave him a ride in his van ( . . this driver was absolutely tired of Paul's never-ceasing flute playing ) , picked up a sweet little loose honey who even slept with him ( . . only to criticize his loud flute music which bludgeons the ears of even the most patient of folks , with a necklace he had bought her used to suffocate her ) and plans the worst for Marion , stalking her everywhere she goes . Marion , before Paul entered her life , had been telling others about her frightening visions , including boyfriend / fisherman Joey ( William Kirby Cullen ) and school gal pal Cathy ( Noelle North ) , and the claims of seeing a psycho planning on burying a victim in a park near a beach without evidence causes them to worry about her mental health . Meanwhile , Paul awaits the moment where he will strike , and somehow Marion must convince somebody to believe her . The film is about as much a melodrama as a psycho-thriller with a sub-plot devoted to the ever-increasing estrangement between Marion and her antagonistic , bullish , drunk of a father , Frank ( Richard Jaeckel ) . Frank's drunkenness was behind the crash which caused Marion's damaged leg . He also is very negatively vocal against her relationship with Joey . Bea ( Antoinette Bower ) , Marion's mother , tries to consistently calm Frank and this tense drama makes up a chunk of the overall film . It all culminates towards the end as Paul attacks Frank with a hatchet in the film's most graphically violent scene which will lead to the maniac chasing after Marion into a darkened sawmill . There's an interesting psychological twist which provides a grim conclusion concerning Marion's state of well being . I think Frankie Avalon's clean-cut , matinée image provides a startling contrast to what hides bubbling under the surface . . I think he actually embraces the dark side of this part and with this new freedom , plays the killer to the hilt . I like how he's actually a wimpy child , his mania as a result of temper tantrums when people " hurt him . " Thanks to the cinematography which presents Paul in a murky manner , Avalon is often shrouded in darkness , his unsettling grin present until provoked towards violence when you insult him . See , Avalon has this kind and soft look about him , he seems very approachable and charming , and then you flick that switch ( . . even on accident ) with the monster released . . that's what I liked best about this little-known slasher . Many slasher faithful will find the home drama perhaps trifling and dull , but I liked the fact that the filmmakers attempted to flesh the characters out . I didn't think the " visions " angle worked , at all really , but the finale ( . . the chase through the sawmill ) was suspenseful and exciting . I have to say , I liked this better than I thought I would . I think it does have a lot to do , though , with the blue collar environment and that the lead actress is normal looking ( . . the 80's , unlike the films of the last 15 or so years , actually featured female leads which looked like someone you might have actually went to school with ) with her own mundane problems to deal with .
436949	9938570	75917	7.0	Dead of Night	The late great Dan Curtis brings us three horror / fantasy tales from the pen of Richard Matheson , featuring a strong cast . Made for television , Curtis was one of the most successful producer-directors working in the field of horror during the 70's . A nice double feature this would make with his superior omnibus , Trilogy of Terror ( . . starring the incomparable Karen Black ) . The first tale ( Second Chance ) stars Ed Begley Jr as Frank , a young man with a knack for restoring older cars , with a knowledge and love for them . He restores a ' 26 London Playboy , understanding from it's past that a teenage couple perished as the driver attempted to pass a train . Driving the Playboy down a dirt road , Frank finds himself in the nearby town Crestwell , except in the 1920's ! This is a poignant tale resembling those time-warp Twilight Zone nostalgia episodes where an otherworldly journey back in time can alter the lives of others , a chance given back due to the particular care of someone towards a machine left buried under a tarp . The second tale ( No Such Thing as a Vampire ) features Patrick Macnee as a professor whose wife ( Christina Hart ) seems to be falling prey to a vampire , under his own nose , asking a colleague ( . . played by Horst Buchholz ) to assist him . Elijah Cook Jr . is Macnee's frightened , superstitious butler . This one has a twist regarding adultery and revenge . And , the third , final , and best tale ( Bobby ) stars Joan Hackett as a deeply traumatized mother who desperately longs for her deceased son , who mysteriously drowned ( Lee Montgomery ; BURNT OFFERINGS ) , going as far as using black magic , attempting to conjure him back from the dead . He does return , but it isn't the son she once knew . This one is stylishly executed and suspenseful as Hacket finds herself fighting for survival with Montgomery chasing her throughout their large house ( . . overlooking a cliff leading to rocks and ocean below ) , playing a game of hide-and-seek trying to kill her , as the thunder roars , power out , and the childlike voice proclaiming , " I'm gonna find you , MOMMY ! " Montgomery has this really boyishly innocent face that makes his character's emerging menace even more palpable . The twist , regarding who this kid really is , adds a nice sock to the senses closing the anthology nicely . The first two tales aren't very potent in the terror category as the opening narration would suggest , but the third tale takes up the slack of both of them , and then some . Interesting enough , DEAD OF NIGHT is quite similar to TRILOGY OF TERROR , structurally , in how the tales impact you . . the first is a mild opener , the second has an eye-opening twist , and the third packs a wallop ( . . quite a roller coaster thrill-ride where a heroine attempts to escape an unlikely malevolent presence bent on inflicting harm , brought to life by a magic spell ) . I think this will entertain fans of classic horror anthologies , but isn't quite as successful or memorable as TRILOGY OF TERROR , mainly because the novelty of starring Karen Black ( . . who displayed her incredible range as an actress ) isn't here . The first film better belongs in a TWILIGHT ZONE anthology movie than in a Dan Curtis production . I found it pleasant , written with heart and care ( . . one can see Matheson's yearning for days gone by ; this one felt particularly Bradbury ) , but not suited for what was supposed to be a " terror trilogy . " The second's draw is Macnee and Cook Jr , even if the result of the tale is only mildly effective . . although , Macnee's wicked grin leaves an unsettling feeling , closing the tale . I think most viewers will leave this movie , impressed with the final tale to the point that the overall product will have legs for years to come .
435681	9938570	68183	7.0	Ricco	A young man named Ricco ( Chris Mitchum ) gets a year off his sentence after serving two years in prison , and quietly sets out to even a score against mafioso king Don Vito ( Arthur Kennedy ) , the man responsible for murdering his mob boss father so that he could have control over the entire city . What erupts is a blood feud where many tragic casualties , innocents whose blood are shed , lie in the wake of Ricco and Vito's rivalry . Ricco finds an ally in an old friend of his father's niece , Scilla ( Barbara Bouchet ) . . Scilla , at first , participates for kicks , but soon finds that she's in love with Ricco and realizes that his feud with Vito will only leave a lot of innocent people dead . Once Ricco gets mixed up with a crooked partner of Vito's , Cyrano ( Eduardo Fajardo ) , once a pal of his father , there's no turning back . Diamonds , and collected dues of those benefactors for whom Vito " protects " , soon play into matters as does Ricco's old squeeze , Rosa ( Malisa Longo ) now " property " of the Don . Vito cherishes Rosa , and anyone who dares even attempt to touch what is his will inherit a trip into his vat of acid . The climax is a shoot-out at Don Vito's factory with Ricco seeking revenge when those he loves are slain in horrific gang-land style fashion . Ultra violent crime thriller with Christopher Mitchum walking tall , saying only what needs to be said . . like his father Robert , Chris doesn't overexert himself . He's quite the cool customer , approaching even the most violent situations with a laid-back calm staring down possible death at every turn . Kennedy inhibits the sadistic Don Vito as if born to play him . . having portrayed villains in westerns with ease , playing the heavy in " Ricco " is a piece of cake . The true star of this film , besides Barbara Bouchet who always knows how to make a scene , is Malisa Longo as Rosa , who takes you completely away from the film immediately casting your eyes towards her . She's quite a feast to salivate over . . the kind of sex kitten who would have you turning cart-wheels and barking like a dog . She's " to die for " and one does , but I certainly understand why one would risk the chance to bed her . Whether walking around in lingerie or bathing top-less , she's a tasty dish . . no a gourmet meal . Matter of fact , she's the best part of the meal . . she's the desirable dessert . I found that Mitchum and Bouchet had good chemistry and that both knew the wattage they carried on screen . Mitchum carries that effortless cool and Bouchet is so damn sexy , and knows it , I never questioned why I liked watching them together on screen . Bouchet even performs a nice little strip-tease for the viewer . . thanks dear for providing another memorable scene ( . . like Bouchet hasn't provided ample memories already ! ) I can carry away into my fantasies . Getting away from the babes , I have to mention the castration scene . One fellow , Tony ( Manuel Zarzo ) can not resist Rosa's sexual advances ( . . given the situation , I can see why he succumbs to her wiles ) and is caught by the Don . Tony fights three of the Don's goons before getting his privates sliced off with a knife . . he then gets his penis and testicles shoved down his throat before being tossed in Vito's acid vat ! If the opening scene where Ricco's father's face is shot in point-blank , then this gory sequence of events does . When it comes to subtlety , you'd better look elsewhere because the Italians always go for broke .
436161	9938570	50393	7.0	Fiend Without a Face	Get a load of this premise : A scientist , whose studies on psychic phenomena are well renowned , has developed an apparatus that drains the atomic power from a US Airforce base radar which provides him with the ability to detach thought from his conscious giving it a separate entity . This entity becomes a monstrous fiend that drains intellect ( ! ) from human victims in a nearby town Winthrop attaching to the base of the occipital region of the neck ( by drilling two small holes ) , penetrating to the medulla obolongata where the spinal cord meets the brain . Now get this , the fiend sucks out each victim's brain while also removing their spinal cord ! Here's the kicker . . they're invisible and need brains to survive and multiply . The scientist , Professor Walgate ( Kynaston Reeves ) , didn't have a clue of what he unleashed on the earth . . all he was wanting to do was test his theories and prove that thought materialization was possible . The town , at first , blame the Airforce base for the deaths of the citizens due to their atomic radar experiments ( they use atomic power to increase the proficiency of their radar range to spy on the Russians ) , but when Major Jeff Cummings ( Marshall Thompson . . many might recognize him from " It ! The Terror from Beyond Space " ) begins snooping for answers they lead right to the Professor , whose physical condition has worsened due to his mental experiments . The climax is just fantastic . . the creatures gain such strength through the growing atomic radiation ( now that the fiends have multiplied , they destroy rods within the plant that control the ability to cut the reactor off ) they appear visible . They look like giant brains with the spinal cord guiding their movements . . they literally move around like snakes up trees and dart through holes at poor victims holed up in the Professor's house ! As Cummings heads for the base nuclear plant , a group of characters try to fend off the fiends . To stop them , the nuclear plant will have to cease giving them the atomic energy they need . The special effects are stunning for a film made in 1958 . The film really consists of amazing stop-motion effects . What's really cool is when the Airforce guys still alive within the Professor's house begin riddling the fiends with bullets . . this strawberry jam like goo pusses out ! I guess it's supposed to resemble blood , but I still thought it was well done under the circumstances of the low budget . You do see the brain creatures attach to victims at the end . The effects for the fiends both invisible when they move on top of ( . . and through ) objects , and the ending where they are visible and move around ( . . one cool sequence has one of the fiends using it's spinal cord to grab a chisel hammer ! ) , I thought were just superb . Consider me quite a fan of this movie . I don't know why it has such a bad rep . For 50's sci-fi monster movie fans , this is a must .
436316	9938570	83722	7.0	Cat People	Long ago the ancestors of Irena and Paul Gallier ( Nastassja Kinski & Malcolm McDowell ) sacrificed their children to the leopards . The souls of the children grew inside the leopards until the leopards became human . They were gods then . They are an incestuous race and can only make love with their own . . otherwise they transfer . Before becoming human again , they must kill . This is explained in a dream sequence to Irena because she is falling head-over-heels for Oliver ( John Heard ) , the main man at a New Orleans zoo . His assistant is Alice ( Annette O'Toole ) and they have to tranquilize a leopard that has almost killed a hooker in one of those sleazy hotel rooms . That panther is actually Paul having succumbed to lust he must needs kill somehow . Unfortunately his wish comes true when Joe ( Ed Begley Jr ) , another one of Oliver's assistants , gets his whole arm ripped out of the torso when he is trying to calm the cat down . Paul's sole desire is to mate with Irena so their torment will end regarding that change that occurs when one strays away from their own kind . But , Irena is so attracted to Oliver that Paul doesn't stand a chance . There in lies the conflict . Oliver deeply desires and wants Irena and vice versa , yet she is caught in an unfortunate situation thanks to her bloodline and heredity . If they partake in wanton sexual activity , she will turn and have to kill . I think the film looks great . Special thanks for the film's visual style goes to Ferdinando Scarfiotti . Director Paul Schrader said that if the powers-that-be would've allowed it he would've added Scarfiotti as co-director . His ideas behind the zoo lab ( how it is set-up is quite original and unique . . it really gives Schrader a chance to be creative with his camera and how he lenses Heard's zoologist walking throughout it ) and the sandy landscape of the ancient sequences at the beginning where we see the leopard sacrificial ritual are stunning . Splashes of color and how Irena sees are flavorful to the eye . Though , despite how wooed I was with how it looked , I thought the story was a bit corny . It's quite lurid and sexually free . Kinski really gives herself over to the part and Schrader's camera hypnotically embraces her . She must expose her beautiful nude body frequently . Though , one might call the film unabashedly sleazy . I mean , I'm not about to complain regarding seeing Annette O'Toole's nice breasts , but one could make a pretty good argument that it was unnecessary . This film only has really one relation to the original film too many people tried to compare it to . . the pool sequence where O'Toole's Alice is possibly threatened by Irena . The transformation sequence isn't too shabby if quick . What's funny ( . . this is how I felt anyway ) was that the film feels so sophisticated it seems to come off less perverse than it really is .
436398	9938570	100688	7.0	Steel and Lace	A brilliant scientist , Albert Morton ( . . renowned character actor Bruce Davison , providing his usual solid performance ) resurrects the memory of his dead sister , Gaily ( Clare Wren , cherubic when she isn't giving her victims the cold stare of doom before executing them ) who committed suicide after her rapist attacker , Daniel Emerson ( Michael Cerveris , perfecting the confident scoundrel ) was found not-guilty by a jury due to " insuffient evidence " thanks to the scumbag's four best friends , who testified on his behalf ( . . and were actually the ones responsible for holding the poor girl down as Daniel molested her ) , by creating a cybernetic killing machine modeled after her . A sketch artist , who worked Gaily's trial , Alison ( Stacy Haiduk , balancing a mousy but hot sex appeal ) is coerced by her agent , Duncan ( Nick Tate ) into returning to her old job , a project dedicated to the ones involved in the trial of Gaily . Alison attempts to rub elbows with old flame , Detective Dunn ( David Naughton ) hoping he'll help her get close to those who were sketched by her during the trial of Gaily , soon discovering that the ones responsible for the rape are being hunted down and murdered in grisly , unusual ways . Driven and determined , Alison will become obsessed with the case when Duncan is killed during an encounter with Gaily . . we come to understand that Albert is behind the scenes commanding her to kill and no one is allowed to interrupt the mission of destroying those responsible for that suicide from five years ago thanks to injustice . Meanwhile , bodies start to pile up with Daniel and those that remain grow more concerned and restless . Can Dunn and Alison stop the blood shed or will Albert complete this cycle of revenge in the memory of his beloved Gaily . I'm a sucker for the " human cyborg " sub-genre , and this little movie suitably entertained me . The practical effects might seem primitive next to a film like Steven Spielberg's AI , but I admire the imaginative methods of destruction such as a spinning drill that cuts a hole all the way through one victim while another's head is removed from his body . The funniest death isn't really overly gory , but appropriately tongue-in-cheek as one victim's body is sucked dry through his pecker . Fans of Romero's DAWN OF THE DEAD should enjoy one victim's skull getting split apart by a helicopter propeller . As many of these movies used to be , the villains ( . . Daniel and his cronies , now businessman in suits swindling good people of their property in criminal ways to plant malls where they live ) are loathsome and lecherous as you root for their destruction . The pace is excellent , even if the story's formula is familiar ( . . five thugs , behind a heinous crime they got away with , facing violent death for their actions in bloody fashion ) . . director Ernest D Farino keeps the film moving , with emphasis on the revenge story wasting no time of needless filler which doesn't contribute to the motivations of the characters and the situation . It's no surprise that this is the kind of film , having a visual effects background , Farino would make , because the story involved hi-tech ( . . for 1991 ) devices used on victims . Many would watch STEEL AND LACE now and probably criticize the effects because they don't necessarily hold up to the advancements of this modern age , but if I had watched this as a kid teenager I would've been thrilled . The story is far-fetched ( . . could Albert really pull off such a concocted plan , and wouldn't Daniel have a security force around him as protection ? ) , but the audience gets to see slime annihilated in very creative ways . . a classic story of revenge with a robotic twist on who is conducting the series of murders , a genre movie all the way . Kind of a tragic and sad conclusion that doesn't allow Albert to get away scot-free , and interesting development showing the cybernetic version of Gaily evolving , desiring to understand emotion and feeling . My favorite visual effects sequence would probably be when Albert is opening up the skull of his cybernetic creation , with the director allowed to show off his skills regarding her robotic brain and the inner workings involved with making her function .
436196	9938570	102690	7.0	Popcorn	Film student with recurring nightmares she records on audio cassette for a potential movie , Maggie ( Jill Schoelen ) joins fellow classmates in a project to raise money so that they could fund future projects of their own . This project is a theater due to be put to rest in a matter of weeks , which the class will use to show three 50's B-movies using gimmicks to entertain the movie-going public who buy a ticket for the overall night . But , a killer will secretly plot to murder several of the students , and teacher Mr . Davis ( Tony Roberts ) as the movies are being projected while Maggie and boyfriend Mark ( Derek Rydall ) work together to find her possible father , a supposedly dead cult director , Lanyard Gates ( Matt Falls ) who murdered her real mother , not the woman who has been raising her since childhood , Suzanne ( Dee Wallace Stone ) . The nightmares which are actually memories surfacing bringing to light what happened to her mother and that her father was indeed the eerie face talking to her , raising a sword to stab her . Is the one responsible for the series of murders actually Gates , or is someone else ( . . a fellow film student with an ax to grind ? ) behind the killings ? A film Gates was making , which reflects almost exactly the nightmares Maggie has been experiencing , is found within the theater by fellow student Toby ( Tom Villard ) . Responsible for all the technical and gimmick equipment for the 50's horror theme night is Dr . Mnesyne ( Ray Walston ) , once in this line of work at shocking the audiences while they watched cheesy low-budget romps . The films shown are " Mosquito ! " a 3-D flick where a puppet mosquito is sent down in front of the audience by a remote control device , " The Amazing Electrified Man " ( . . where buzzers on seats shock the asses of customers ' theater seats ) & " The Stench " where smelly fumes are released into the theater . The tame deaths include one wheel-chair victim being electrocuted , one exploding in a bathroom stall when a chemical agent was dropped into the the toilet , and two nifty murders by the puppet mosquito whose proboscis stabs into two victims . The one responsible for the murders wishes to finish what was started on Gates ' unfinished film , The Possessor , putting Maggie in danger . The most disturbing aspect of the film is that the psycho is heavily burned , wearing prosthetic masks taking the faces of victims . This film attempts to put an imaginative spin on the dying slasher genre ( . . before it's rebirth with Craven's Scream ) while also paying homage to classic B-movies and William Castle .
436279	9938570	57226	7.0	The Kiss of the Vampire	Gerald and Marianne Harcourt are on their honeymoon when the motorcar they are driving runs out of petrol . They have no idea that the village they have to stay at houses a nearby vampire , satanic cult lead by the sophisticated evil Ravna and his son Carl in a château where many reside . Through the sufferings of hotel proprietors Bruno and Anna is an example of what Ravna can take away with his evil vampiric spell . When Marianne falls under the spell of Ravna , Gerald will have to join forces with Professor Zimmer to stop Ravna . Stunning and intense Hammer film is of a surprising quality . . it also has this enormous task of being great without the usual suspects such as Cushing or Lee as actors & Terence Fisher or Freddie Francis as director . The color , writing , acting , and suspense is top-notch . Ravna has an evil presence because he takes from loving families and turns their innocence into corruption . There's a powerful scene where Gerald is able to make his way into the château finding his beloved Marianne in a trance . Ravna has Marianne even spit in Gerald's face as a way of enforcing the fact that she is no longer the woman he loves . The film , despite a marvelous suspenseful set-up having us wonder if Marianne will ever be saved from the mental grasp of Ravna , does have an abrupt , silly ending as Zimmer calls upon a horde of bats from a spell he speaks inside a pentagon that will strike at Ravna's château & his unfortunate " family " as they are trapped inside unable to escape ( Zimmer placed the mark of the cross on all the doorways and exits ) .
436807	9938570	104053	7.0	Trauma	A serial killer , who collects heads from the victims he / she decapitates , " murders " a troubled anorexic teen's " medium " mother ( Piper Laurie ) and Romanian father ( Dominique Serand ) . David ( Chris Rydell ) , an artist , assists Aura ( Asia Argento ) in her quest to find out the butcher who claimed the lives of her parents while also trying desperately to remain distant from the clutches of Dr . Judd ( Frederic Forrest ) who wants to put her back in the Farraday Clinic so that she can get the proper treatment from her illness . Meanwhile , the killer continues killing selected people as David and Aura find out that each person was acquainted with one another and it deals with a tragic accident one rainy night with a Dr . Lloyd ( Brad Dourif ) playing a major part . As they search for answers , the motive for the headhunter will become clear . The killer lives next door to a boy who studies and collects butterflies . That boy notices the wire-machine that the killer uses to collect his / her head-trophies and will play a specific part at the end . A decent Argento effort is better than a lot of horror directors ' really good work and TRAUMA has a visual polish and style ( . . not to mention ghoulish , sometimes humorous , beheadings ) that makes up for a rather tacky ending . . an ending I just didn't really buy into . I thought the one beheading , from a female victim David finds out about Lloyd from , is quite inspired as is a head-removal using an elevator shaft . Argento uses POV shots mostly with the camera acting as the eyes of the killer . Perhaps the melodrama concerning anorexia is a tad heavy-handed ( . . this is a slasher flick after all ) , but Argento admitted the story regarding the disease was personal ( concerning a niece he has that was suffering with it at the time he decided on making a film with a female lead character suffering with the problem ) . It brings a uniqueness to the character so I have no real qualms with it .
436607	9938570	211443	7.0	Jason X	In 2455 , serial killer Jason Voorhies ( the film confirms he murdered over 200 victims ) is accidentally set free from cryogenic stasis to dismantle and destroy a crew on board a transport ship heading home . Along with Jason was Rowan ( Lexa Doig ) who tried to stop Jason back home on earth where they were both found . . it was indeed her who trapped Jason in the cryogenic chamber , was stabbed by Jason using his trademark machete from the inside through her on the outside which opens the coolant to freeze her as well . She understands what kind of zombie monster he is as explained with how they tried many other aspects and methods of death which wouldn't end him . One by one members on board try and fail to stop Jason . Those still alive for the time being contemplate how to escape the ship before he catches up with them . This New Line release , much like the ninth film ( JASON GOES TO HELL ) , takes the Jason model and tries to spin a new , different type of story set in the future allowing the monster fresh new ways to kill humans . Supporters of Jason enacting bloodshed in his normal environs might balk , but a chance to see him out of his normal routine is refreshing . And , the flick plays it's wacky premise to the hilt . The computer effects are decent , if less stellar than normal bigger-budgeted films , but the gore is on display aplenty . One poor soul is cut in half , another is thrown on a drill ( the scene shows the man's body sliding down the screw piece ) , and in the film's best sequence a female medic's head is submerged in cryogenic fluid and smashed over a counter as it shatters into pieces . There's an amusing holograph sequence where they buy time to survive by creating an illusion of Crystal Lake with two nudie cuties distracting Jason . There's even a female android who does battle with Jason ( it isn't much of a contest as she has superior firepower that subsequently blows him to bits ) . . when it appears that he is finally conquered , he is reconstructed by a mechanical device that can repair torn tissue and muscles , into a half-cybernetic being ! This is clearly a flick designed for the Friday audience allowing us to see Jason doing what he does best , killing innocents who try their damnedest to escape the terror that awaits them .
436851	9938570	89087	7.0	The Emerald Forest	Tommy is taken from his family by an Amazon tribe called " The Invisible Ones " and father Bill spends ten years searching for him . After finding a few leads , he has an encounter with a dangerous cannibal tribe called " The Fierce Ones " and actually stumbles on his son as he tries to flee for his life . The dilemma of the piece comes with a decision left up to Tommy , leave his tribe which are essentially his real family after ten years of living with them or joining his father in the modern civilization across the river . The film is more a focus on how modernization , progress if you will , has began to wipe out the trees and land of Amazon tribes as they slowly die out . Interesting enough is that Bill is a model example of this type of progress as he heads a log dam which clears land once civilized by The Fierce Ones tribe . He will spend time with The Invisible Ones tribe and find the error of his ways seeing that what he and others ( White Man ) are doing to people who have lived here for centuries destroying cultures . We also see how the ugliness of prostitution has became a stigma to tribes as The Fierce Ones trade women from The Invisible Ones tribe for machine guns . Using the machine guns , The Fierced Ones have a clear advantage over The Invisible Ones and their mere spears . Again , through that we see how progress can also destroy a civilization . . The Fierce Ones can wipe out who they deem a threat and / or nuisance with advanced weaponry . When The Invisible Ones lose a great deal of their men to those machine gun attacks , Tomme ( his name amongst his tribe ) will search for his father across the river for help to get back their women who have been traded to a prostitution house . Stunning cinematography ( by Philippe Rousselot ) and score are highlights of this amazingly shot film set in the Amazon . Through Boorman's fluid camera-work , we follow the characters as they travel to destinations in the immense forest , yet see what is happening as modernization is chopping away the trees that once populated said Amazon forest . I thought the angle of the modern age clashing with tribal customs in the form of Tommy to be the strong point of the film while the progress part of the film as it pertains to the cultures being wiped out laid on a bit too thick . I didn't quite like the remaining twenty minutes ( the deal with the prostitution ring resulting in heavy violence and the whole rain ordeal as it destroys the dam ) as much as the first hour as Powers Booth's Bill was amongst a culture of people he knew nothing about . Seeing his son almost completely tribal is interesting not to mention the viewer getting a glimpse into a unique culture of people and their ways of living . The mythological aspects were also diverting from the realism of the film ( if a wee bit silly ) . Young Charley Boorman is quite impressive as Tomme .
436558	9938570	317919	7.0	Run , Tom , Run	Ethan ( Tom Cruise , who puts in a demandingly physical performance ) is retired from field work , engaged , and happy until he's called upon to rescue an operative he trained ( Keri Russell ) from an evil black market " deliverer " , Owen Davian ( Philip Seymour Hoffman , who makes a great villain within the screen time he's given ) . When that mission ends tragically , Ethan and his MI task force ( consisting of one-two-three punch of Ving Rhames , Jonathan Rhys Meyers , & Maggie Q ) will join to try and stop Davian's selling of weaponry and other dangerous war toys to varying countries . Davian is a national threat to everyone and must be stopped . What Ethan doesn't know , however , is that someone within his own organization is partnering with Davian . What's even worse is that Ethan's beloved wife Julia ( the delightful Michelle Monaghan ) is in grave danger ( as evident , it seems , in the opening harrowing sequence ) . With seemingly insurmountable odds ( the deck is indeed stacked ) , how will Ethan ever be able to not only Davian , but uncover a high-ranking suit in his own organization ? And , is there any hope for Julia ? The mysterious weapon Davian has stolen from him by Ethan and the gang is a suitcase housing some sort of nuclear weapon nicknamed the " Rabbit's Foot . " This could've easily been titled , " Run Tom Run " because Cruise is constantly moving and film briskly follows him . JJ Abrams creates an energy in MI : III very akin to his " Alias " series where you never know who to trust and the camera never stops moving . The film feels a lot like " Bourne Supremacy " and is almost as fun . It has one of those endings , though , that doesn't quite match other inspiring action set-pieces such as the remarkable " attack on the bridge " sequence where Ethan and his crew are being shot at by a jet plane's missiles not to mention helicopter soldiers ' machine guns . Also , the Shanghai sequence where Ethan uses a fulcrum to swing himself from one building to another and then parachuting from that building almost being hit by several vehicles is also a masterful highlight . The ending just seems rather uninspired next to those sequences . This film , I'd have to say , is the most entertaining and energetic of the series . The cast is much more lively and the pacing which darts after the characters is almost exhausting .
436739	9938570	71318	7.0	Chosen Survivors	Selected intellectual minds , and important folks deemed special for forwarding the human race once a thermonuclear war is to rage across the globe , find themselves fighting for their very lives underground in their fancy governmentally ( supposedly ) secure bomb shelter well equipped with all the resources they could possibly need as vampire bats , which rest within a cavernous area secret to them , enter and attack when the group is most vulnerable . With a female assigned , via taped recording , guiding their day to day activities , offering a planned regimen for them to survive on , the group find themselves at odds with Raymond Couzins , a loudmouth who often stirs up bad vibes with his constant talk of conspiracy theories , and drunken insults . Yet , perhaps there is some truth to what he's saying as Dr . Peter Macomber ( Bradford Dillman ) holds a secret which will only add to the worsening mental state of the group as a whole . Realizing that they were merely part of an experiment on how a group could function together in an isolated situation , had such a catastrophic event taken place , the group hope that a signal had reached Washington , for Couzins , in a bumbling mishap that damages important electrical equipment resulting in the death of a member , leaves them with few alternatives left . Major Gordon Ellis ( Richard Jaeckel ) comes up with a method that could be quite dangerous . . someone could climb an elevator shaft 17oo feet which could open a door to the outside providing a chance for contacting help . Macomber , despite the group's hostile feelings towards he and his government which put them in their difficult crisis , comes up with an idea on how to kill the bats , through electrocution by suckering them with blood as bait . I must say that this was a pleasant form of entertainment . Sure , the special effects are rather inferior to today's modern technical improvements , but they didn't seem to bother me all that much because I found the cast so much fun to watch , and the premise was quite enjoyable . It's essentially mixes the always-reliable " animals attack " premise with the theme of nuclear war and how mankind could deal with such a thing . Perfectly capping these elements with a government conspiracy plot yielding terrified characters in search of an exit . Perfectly 70's carrying the sensibilities of the time , with a cast of familiar faces . I thought Dillman has a startlingly good scene where he admits to who he really is and the hoax that has put them all in grave danger . . I think Dillman realistically displays the emotional weight his character is bearing in both coming clean with his confession while showing that he believed that the experiment was for the betterment of mankind . I thoroughly enjoyed Cooper as the antagonist , and Jaeckel is a delight as the sincere army man , burdened with keeping the underground shelter under operation despite a series of set-backs that make that nearly impossible . I also loved this confrontation between the accusing Couzins claiming Ellis was perhaps behind a conspiracy to keep them in the shelter . . Jaeckel and Cooper produce some fireworks . Some performances are overwrought , as often was the case for Made-for-television movies with character actors , but I think the situation stressing and depressing those caught between a rock and a hard place , warranted such heightened emotions . I think Woody's elevator shaft climb was quite suspenseful . . it sure had me biting my nails . I do think the story provides some food for thought , and is a perfect time capsule of what was on the minds of the country at that time .
436695	9938570	75261	7.0	Squirm	Surprisingly fascinating " nature goes berserk " film opting to go more towards a character driven piece than you normally see in these kind of films . The plot is really silly , but fortunately Lieberman has the skills to shoot the film evocatively ( especially the wooded areas and candlelit nighttime when the worms descend on a town not ready for them ) . The cast , and good Georgia accents , also bring a freshness to this film that adds an original peculiarity to the mix . It isn't exactly gory , where Lieberman seems to want it to get under your skin more than shock you with graphic violence . That feeling of dread knowing they will eventually come out from hiding , the hordes of them , also adds a quiet intensity to the film . I like the leads of Don Scardino as Mick , from " the city " , who comes to Georgia to begin a hopeful relationship with the sexy Patricia Pearcy as Geri . The other element of fear derives from loony Roger ( RA Dow ) who desires Geri and is insanely jealous of Mick . Rounding out the interesting cast is Jean Sullivan as Geri's traumatized , numb mother Naomi ( recently losing her husband has certainly caused a depression ) , Fran Higgins as Geri's sister Alma , and Peter MacLean as the Sheriff ( with the teeth ) who doesn't like Mick in his little town " starting trouble . "
436493	9938570	92576	7.0	Stagefright	A stage production comes under siege of a serial killing actor ( notorious for shopping up 16 different victims to pieces with an axe ) named Irving Wallace who has escaped the holding cell of a psychiatric hospital . After a stagehand is killed with a pickax , the director quietly decides to continue his stage production out of desperation for his sagging career and a good payday . He informs actress Corinne ( Loredana Parrella ) to lock the exit / entrance door and hide the key . Of course , she's the next female victim to be killed , viciously stabbed by Wallace , who hides under the hawk head of actor Brett ( Giovanni Lombardo Radice , really playing his prototypical homosexual prankster to the hilt in scene-stealing fashion ) . So the crew who decided to stay on and continue the play are trapped in the building ! If that isn't inspired , I don't know what is . The rest of the film has the crew trying to stay close together and alive as Wallace roams the building with various weapons he confiscated from a workshop ( including a drill which penetrates the stomach of one victim , a chainsaw which cuts one fellow's arm clean off and cuts two more poor helpless souls in half , and stabs another quite viciously with a blade ) . The female protagonist is Alicia ( Barbara Cupisti ) , an actress fired from the leading role when she escaped from the building for a while to get her bruised ankle looked at ( coincidently by a doctor at the psychiatric hospital ; Wallace hid in the backseat of Alicia and her stagehand friend's car ) . They do remember a skeleton key being placed in an office desk drawer which might be their only means out of the building . Soon , the killer will have it and Alicia will have to use her brains to get out of the building or else . Director Soavi himself plays one of the cops stationed outside the building in the car supposedly to guard them from further harm . . he has a novel with the photo of James Dean printed on it wondering to his partner if he resembles the Hollywood legend . Not exactly original , but a pulse-pounding gore-thriller nonetheless . Soavi was establishing himself here staying close to the genre of his predecessors . He'd later make his own path with Dellamorte Dellamore . Stagefright is very stylish with a rather silly ending that just won't quit .
436507	9938570	88000	8.0	Revenge of the Nerds	Watching NERDS again just proved that despite it's lovingly exploitive attitude , the jokes ( albeit perhaps dated after 20 years ) reflecting the on-going nerd culture as computers were becoming the key for the success of very intelligent people who dress and act a bit different are what make it so appealing . I think it's a time-capsule teen comedy when the formula worked and well . The film is based in stereotyping , but that is another one of it's appealing traits . It's easy for us who never really felt we belonged in the popular set to side with the victimized nerds for they represent the lonely-hearts who bask in the giant hurdled insult . The film , despite hurling those insults , engagingly loves these nerds and I think that's another key to the film's success . We can understand that without the wonderful performances from the cast portraying the nerds that this film just couldn't fly . The film is also so immersed in 80's pop culture that it is an amusing memory to dredge back up . The film shows the jocks as cretins pretty much abusive in every way . They step over the nerds because they deem themselves superior because of what they have externally than internally . We can see that they have to depend on what they have on the outside ( brawn and good-looks ) because the nerds completely overwhelm them on the inside . Carradine as Louis and Edwards as Gilbert are definitely the spark plug for the film and are so wonderful and likable , the material looks better . Then you have the gross-out jokes that worked well for Belushi in " Animal House " in this film represented by Curtis Armstrong's Booger who burps loudest and picks his nose the deepest . And , he can hurl one mean hilarious insult . His quips are the most funniest . Then you have Timothy Busfield as the elder Poindexter who seems to be the most clumsiest nerd of the bunch who sure has a hard time with the robotic maid . You have Larry Scott as the homosexual Lamar where the humorous gay jokes fly . Ted McGinley is the prick leader of the Alpha Beta jocks and Donald Gibb is The Ogre ( who probably would be considered a nerd if he wasn't so massive ) . Then there's the oh-so yummy Betty Childs who is McGinley's girl but falls in love with Louis after she discovers how good nerds actually are at sex . There's this non-PC attitude that reigns supreme as full frontal nudity is in heavy doses and many of the jokes would indeed be considered offensive . But , it comes down to seeing the nerds out-shine and out-last those jocks that leaves us particularly satisfied .
435964	9938570	70423	8.0	The Freakmaker	A university professor by day , mad scientist by night , Dr . Nolter ( Donald Pleasence exuding a quiet mania , portraying his character as someone completely convinced that his work is for the betterment of mankind despite how diabolical his methods are ) , respected by his peers , creates hybrid plant-humans in a goal to form a new evolution of mankind , using his own students brought to him by a carnival owner , Lynch ( Tom Baker , under effective hideous facial make-up ) plagued with the glandular Elephant Man disease . Lynch believes reluctantly that Nolter will cure him of his problem , for which he continues delivering specimens , but as friends of bio-chemistry wunderkind Brian Redford ( Brad Harris ) and Hedi ( Julie Ege ) come up missing , it's only a matter of time before the professor's ghoulish experiments and Lynch's kidnapping will be discovered . Lynch has another problem of his own making . . he treats his carnival employees ( . . freaks , to the " normal " audience who cheer , sneer & fear them during shows ) cruelly , displaying an ugliness just as much inside as outside . Lynch's crew have tolerated his insults and nasty treatment for a long time , and this film shows how his behavior towards them will result in a violent revolt echoing Tod Browning's masterpiece " Freaks . " And , as typical of " mad scientist " movies , the creation will get revenge on it's creator . . Nolter creates a plant-man who ingests humans for consumption from a belligerent student of his who always replied in classes against his theories . Macabre premise delivers some shocking moments including Nolter's creations and how one of them eats a street bum . Nolter's fate is especially grotesque . Baker is far removed from his charismatic , charming Doctor Who in portraying quite a tormented monster of a man who will do anything to remove the diseased face that keeps him removed from the society he yearns for . I found the seedy elements startling . . such as Lynch's finding a prostitute willing to yield to his desires for a certain fee , the numerous displays of female nudity , and how female specimens have their clothes removed while unconscious on Nolter's laboratory slab before being experimented on . But , despite all the rather unpleasant mutations we are witnesses to , the opening of the plant cycle , set to rather unnerving music , actually was as effective ( . . if not more ) to me than what comes after . And , director Cardiff has a lengthly showcase for the " freaks " of the carnival , with the viewer as " grossed out " or transfixed by each representative allowed to display their abnormality , as the audience in attendance . The script can be quite literate , whose " science-speak " might bore many viewers . If you're wondering whether or not Pleasence is hammy , he's indeed quite low-key , playing the doctor with a calm confidence .
436831	9938570	88024	8.0	The Scarecrow reviews " Runaway "	In the future , robotics has become an important part of society fulfilling roles once operated by humans . Housekeeping robots , agricultural robots , etc . Well , robotics has become such an important aspect in life that a special crimes division is specially directed at " robot crimes " . . such as malfunctions amongst the most serious threat . Tom Selleck portrays Sgt Jack Ramsey , once a beat cop who decided to step away from that role when his problem with vertigo leads to a killer getting away and killing a family not long after . He began studying the field of robotics as he explains to his new female partner , Karen Thompson ( Cynthia Rhodes ) , and found that he above every one else in the understanding of such a field . Thompson gets an idea of the rather mundane part of the role when a agricultural robot goes berserk messing up a crop . But , she also sees the ugly side as Ramsey has to upend a robot which has killed members of David Johnson's ( Chris Mulkey ) family . This sequence is stellar and we see how good Ramsey is at disarming difficult situations . It also shows how those who try to get in without understanding Ramsey's methods ( a television cameraman who makes a bad decision to follow Ramsey ) will perish . Once Ramsey looks inside the robot , it is found that a smart chip was planted to force the robot to turn maniacal . That man is Dr . Charles Luther ( Gene Simmons who is very good as a sadistic , vile human being who pierces you with his bulging , obsessed eyes ) who wishes to sell his technology of creating killing robots , designed to be terrorist toys . He had maneuvered Johnson and another doctor ( who we see killed by a robotic spider ) to create these smart chips with the capability to force robots to coordinate and destroy selected targets . Luther has this unique gun he uses which fires a heat seeking missile . It is used to kill Johnson when Ramsey and Karen try to apprehend him . Luther's lover , Jackie ( Kirstie Alley ) is caught in a room with specific computer parts needed to put together the whole terror-sell operation . Jackie is caught , unfortunately , by a robot which has flipped it's lid . The robot isn't deadly and can only shoot electric bolts which knock you down or annoyingly shock you . After Ramsey is able to successfully ( though not without a few bolts which threw him for a loop ) stop the renegade robot , he finds lots of computer property in Jackie's possession . They are successfully able to get information on where Luther is ( in a meeting with some clientèle ) , but Ramsey isn't able to get him for he has that gun hidden in his coat and a " floater " robot which blows smoke throughout the room . This time Karen is hit by a missile dislodged in her arm intact . In a harrowing sequence , Ramsey must remove it without hardly any movement . . Karen will have to undergo serious agony without moving her arm . The rest of the film consists of Luther and Ramsey playing cat-and-mouse as Jackie's life is now in danger after revealing her information . Not only that , but Luther is also able to find and kidnap Ramsey's son ( yes , the old kidnapping cop's son bit ) . The film shows Luther's cunning with computers and how he has eyes open at all times . The film's true tension derives from that very fact . I've read countless reviews for this film and none provides any enthusiasm towards " Runaway . " I don't see what the real problem is . I thought it was well paced , with some interesting little robotic creations , the cast seems game . . it's perfect for a lazy Summer afternoon .
436346	9938570	37168	8.0	The Pearl of Death	This time a sought after Borgia Pearl is the object of desire , worth snapping the lumbar vertebrae of many unfortunate victims ' backs at the hands of the sinister Creeper ( Rondo Hatton ) , working for a lecherous thief , the devilish , elusive Giles Conover ( Miles Mander ) . Sherlock Holmes and Dr . Watson are out to discover why innocent people are found dead , their china dishes broken all over the crime scenes . A Borgia Pearl was stolen by Conover in a daring heist actually caused when Holmes himself proved to the museum curator that his security system was flawed , inadvertently assisting the conniving con artist who almost got away with it . Conover had to get rid of the pearl temporarily and Holmes & Watson soon discover that it was hidden in one of six plaster busts of Napoleon . . it's essential that Holmes get to the bust containing the pearl before Conover and The Creeper do , or else another victim might be targeted . Of course , Holmes must contend with Scotland Yard's Inspector Lastrade ( Dennis Hoey ) , who is assigned to the rash of serial killings , having to tolerate his temperament and obtrusive attitude . Along the way , Holmes ' life is in danger because he poses a threat to Conover's plans . Universal Studio's regular Evelyn Ankers has a substantial supporting role as Conover's lovely partner-in-crime , Naomi Drake , who uses aliases and disguises to secure information for her protégé . Hatton's The Creeper is quite an effectively spooky villain , barely seen but quite established thanks to director Roy William Neill's superb methods of building his presence until his reveal late into the film . Rathbone is more intense in this film , because of his treatment by authoritative figures and the press who blame him personally for the loss of the pearl , and Bruce's lovable Watson almost gets his best friend killed when Conover attempts to kill the Baker Street sleuth with a book containing a springing dagger . Mander , as Conover , has a very wily villain which contends with Moriarty as one of Holmes ' more despicable and challenging foes . The Universal Studios production values add immensely to the beautiful look of the film and this cast couldn't be much better . Macabre plot , to boot .
436527	9938570	113361	8.0	Huntress : Spirit of the Night	Tara ( Jenna Bodnar ) returns to Breckin , Northern Wales where she was born to attend her father's funeral . She was sent to America , because of her father's fear that a savage beast plaguing the surroundings of the area would harm her . Actually , thanks to a diary containing her father's recorded thoughts and newspaper clippings with photographs , given to her by butler Geoffrey ( Constantin Cotimanis ) , Tara discovers that a panther was behind a mass of slayings , shot by a Breckin citizen , with it's owner , a witch , cursing the female populace to carry the spirit of her beloved animal . Tara finds a young naked female being hunted by a village mob looking for a beast prowling the area killing citizens again , on her father's estate , and watches as the spirit leaves her body looking for a new host to rest . . in Tara does it find such rest . While actually being sexually repressed , Tara finds this primal spirit providing an extra motivation to embrace her carnal desires . Meanwhile , childhood friend , Michelle ( Blair Valk ) and crush , Alek ( David Starzyk ) wish to purchase Tara's father's estate . Michelle has a specific reason why she wishes to get her hands on the estate , having seduced Alek into finding investors interested in forking over the appropriate funds to do so . But , as Tara becomes accustomed to her surroundings , the atmosphere of it all enveloping her , she may wish to stay , even against the urgings of Geoffrey , worried about her well-being , and local antique-dealer , Ty Bodi ( Charles Cooper ) , a friend of her father's , who believes in the legend of the panther spirit , warning her of it's evil . Through Ty does Tara realize that the beast killed her mother . Also , Tara meets a photographer , Jacob ( Michael Wiseman ) who she falls for . He's in the area capturing wild life for a magazine , a cavern his temporary refuge and studio . She willingly accepts an offer to pose for him and does so provocatively , letting go of her inhibitions , the animal inside unleashing her from the cage holding her true self at bay . If Tara doesn't sell the estate , Michelle will try more lethal methods . . As a few others have already mentioned in the user comments section , I felt this is a loose variation on " Cat People " . The ravishing Jenna Bodnar has enough acting skill to tackle the role of an outsider transitioning to the new environs where folklore and superstition still remain in the hearts of many . I think , however , this works best as a piece of erotica because Bodnar has such a magnificent body , her figure so well-defined , and director Mark S Manos has the knack for arranging several set-pieces to showcase her " talents . " My favorite , besides the terrific cavernous photo session where lightning , rain , and a campfire enhance her naked flesh being bathed with water as it falls , is the first true night where Tara is caught up in a wave of lustful abandon , the animal inside emerging as she takes to a group of steps ( . . nice prop provided by the director so that Bodnar could work over it , her body barely confined within the silk robe , only a strap containing it ) set up in a room overlooking the wilderness , a lantern swaying to and fro . The director's camera covers every inch of Bodnar's body , up and down every curve . Carefully edited are the sex scenes . I think the director wishes for you to salivate over Bodnar , the story is of little consequence next to her " sexual awakening " as the spirit takes hold , ever so pushing her to embrace the dark side , chambered for so long . As a horror film , it isn't successful . I think the film uses the sexuality of " Cat People " , while neglecting the violence that derives from being consumed with the aggressive tendencies of the panther to hunt for food . It is mentioned in the film , through newspaper articles of recent attacks and the ever so glum Ty Bodi condemning Tara to leave at once . I cared little about the angle with Michelle and Alek . . although , Valk is incredibly sexy and has a very memorable disrobing before crawling on all fours on top of a piano . Unfortunately , though , her threesome with Tara and Alek is uninspired which is a shame since all are attractive . See it for Bodnar , she doesn't disappoint . She even turned me on moving her tongue down a butcher knife in a fantasy sequence . Executively produced by Charles Band ( . . my DVD carries his Full Moon label ) and filmed on stunning , richly lush Romanian locations . . there's an enchanting nature this location gives off that seems just right for an erotic fantasy .
436841	9938570	65569	8.0	Count Dracula	Franco's take on the Bram Stoker novel with Christopher Lee again portraying Count Dracula , except this production ( . . a meager one at best with Franco admitting in a recent interview that he had to front his own financing to finish the film ! ) is completely sub-dued from the acting to the presentation . Director Jesús Franco does exploit an obsession of his in this film . . his love for the use of a zooming camera lens . During moments of dialogue Jesús Franco loves for his camera's eye to hone in on the faces of his casts , and even lingers on the mouth of Dracula as his fangs become slightly visible . I do think that this technique can work , but , to be honest , Jesús Franco does tend to go overboard a bit . It does seem like he has inferior equipment . . his camera , at times , seems to have the jitters , and the focus & color occasionally obscure . But , I liked this film much more than I thought I would . I love the opening sequence with an elder Dracula " welcoming " Harker into his decadent castle . Dracula looks overwrought from the dead atmosphere of his ancestral home , where he belovedly speaks , with passion and authority , about his proud family and how they fought and won wars bravely . Yet , in that castle he remains , and I think that you can see it through Lee , a relic of a begone era . The blood of those in a completely different place far removed from home , will bring the youth he seeks . Like always , Lee can merely open a door and you stand at attention . That whole scene in his castle , before venturing off to seek fresh victims elsewhere nearby Van Helsing's mental institution , is probably my favorite of the film because it brings something different to the oft-filmed character , establishing this version of Dracula performed by Lee , as more than just a blood-sucker . If only Franco had been able to afford better special effects . He does use the location of Barcelona impeccably . I would've enjoyed a better confrontation between Lee and Lom , but to see them ( . . along with Kinski and Miranda ) in the same film , even if they were often filmed separately , is enough pleasure for me . For a long period of time in my youth , I only knew Lom primarily as Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus , the constant recipient of aggravation from Peter Seller's bumbling Inspector Clouseau . Since watching more 60's & early 70's horror , I've come to find Lom an icon of the genre . He can hold you captive with his mere presence , just as Lee . He's not as much a theatrical actor as this authoritative , commanding figure who draws you to him like a moth to the flame . I didn't mind Franco's constant zooming towards Lom's face because he has always delivers something interesting with his Van Helsing character . Lom is formidable and this really bodes well because there is a good portion of the film where Lee's Count is away from the screen . I think , in order to hold the viewer's interest ( . . or those who want to see Lee all the time ) , it's important to cast other interesting actors . This leads me to Klaus Kinski . I have to admit that I wasn't expecting this type of interpretation from Kinski as the often dementedly performed character of Renfield . Klaus , I don't think , ever finishes a complete sentence , preferring to show the terror on Renfield's face as he slowly awaits the arrival of Dracula . Even within a padded cell , you can see , through the facial mannerisms and hypnotic blue eyes of Kinski , Renfield's plight . Unlike past interpretations of Renfield , Kinski doesn't deliver deranged monologues about the Count , but channels the horrors of what he knows through silence ( . . often seen staring , almost mime-like in how he makes for the window of his cell as it faces the mansion with which his enemy resides ) and gesture . Soledad Miranda's exotic beauty is definitely put to good use as Lucy , Dracula's chosen source of blood . Fred Williams , as Lucy's fiancé Jonathan Harker , and Jack Taylor as Mina's fiancé Quincy Morris , are more or less secondary characters . They're important as vampire hunters , urged by Van Helsing to stop Dracula before he can harm other innocents . The lovely Maria Rohm ( Venus in Furs ) has the role of Mina , but she is used mainly on screen to scream when she sees Dracula .
435820	9938570	53085	8.0	The Mummy	An archaeological dig unearths the ancient Egyptian burial tomb of High Preistess Princess Ananka . Inside a secret burial chamber is the mummified corpse of Kharis ( Christopher Lee ) imprisoned for blaspheming the laws of their god in his attempts to bring Ananka back from the dead using the sacred Scroll of Life , because of his devoted love for her . John Banning's ( Peter Cushing ) father , Stephen ( Felix Aylmer ) doesn't heed the warnings of Mehemet Bey ( George Pastell ) regarding the desecration of his Princess ' tomb . Stephen , who removes the Scroll of Life from it's place , doesn't realize that in doing so opens the burial chamber door . Making matters even worse , Stephen reads text from the scroll which bring life back to Kharis as he exits his chamber . While Stephen is overcome with hysteria at what he just saw , Mehemet Bey takes command of the scroll and Kharis , vowing to kill the three who entered the sacred tomb of his goddess , removing precious artifacts that belong where they were placed . Returning to England , John's father slowly awakens from his emotional plight while resting in a nursing home , to inform his son of Kharis . Thinking his father still ill , John is concerned but bothered by such a statement . When placed in a padded cell after a frightened outburst , Stephen is attacked and killed by Kharis , ordered by Mehemet Bey , when the mummy intruded through a heavily shielded window . Later , John's uncle is strangled right before his eyes after Kharis explodes through his front door . John realizes that his father wasn't just raving madly , and faces the fact that he's next to die . While his testimony of his uncle's killer being in a " comatose state of living death " to the police makes him sound loony , John will attempt to face off with Kharis , only to be saved by his wife , Isobel ( Yvonne Furneaux ) who is the spitting image of Ananka . After the attack , Inspector Mulrooney ( Eddie Byrne ) will inform John about an Egyptian who lives not too far from the asylum where his father was murdered . Mulrooney tells him of a crate falling into a bottomless bog , carrying " relics " to the home of this Egyptian , for which John will take it upon himself to meet the man who is indeed Mehemet Bey . Bey will this time follow Kharis to the home of John in one last attempt to fulfill the goal of repairing the honor of his people for the desecration . It was finally cool for me to sit down and check out Hammer's take on the Universal Mummy series . Obviously , being a major Cushing fan , I enjoyed his starring as the archaeologist , with a bum knee he didn't get repaired , having to use his wits to defeat the much stronger undead foe . I was equally pleased with Pastell as Cushing's true foe , Mehemet Bey , who is actually controlling Kharis as a killing device . There's a great scene where John and Bey meet at the Egyptian's English home . . John attempts to ruffle Bey's feathers by attacking , in a wonderfully sophisticated manner , his beliefs which will incite his anger leading him to act against his nemesis , exposing his guilt . While the sets and props used for the Egyptian tomb and people look like exactly that ( . . which , unlike purists , didn't bother me the slightest , understanding Hammer's limited budget ) , I found Lee ( cutting that tall imposing figure as he bursts through doors and windows , strangling smaller victims with ease ) as the mummy , " swathed in bandages " and covered in bog mud , quite effective . Sure Jack Pierce's detailed mummy wraps for Karloff are superior to those in Hammer's film , but Lee still looks quite menacing ( . . and , a credit to his performance , where we can see only his eyes , he brings extra emotion during the scenes where Kharis sees Isobel , obeying her commands , the presence of love and sadness echoing what he felt as a dashing Egyptian servant so long ago ) and his bandages are decent enough . It's a tall order for anyone to match the Pierce design , whether it be werewolf or mummy , so I cut Hammer some slack . As far as the premise for this " re-imagining " , basically Hammer takes the best elements from Universal's Mummy series , combining them to create this entertaining effort . You have Kharis being controlled by a shadowy Egyptian hiding in secrecy as he orders his weapon of destruction towards " unbelievers " who dare desecrate the tombs of his people's civilizations . You have John's wife Isobel baring a striking resemblance to Ananka which the archaeologist will use to save himself from harm . You have the Mummy killing members of an archaeological dig with English police baffled as to what kind of fiend could commit such murderous deeds . But , ultimately , the success can be contributed to the big three , Cushing / Lee / Fisher joining forces once again bringing us yet another thrilling horror tale . The film provides a flashback to Ananka's burial and Kharis ' fate at trying to resurrect her ( . . with us getting to see a human Lee in Egyptian garb and face paint ) as John reads through his father's notes , speaking about their ways and beliefs .
436422	9938570	24360	8.0	Murders in the Zoo	Startlingly violent , potent shocker for a 30's film stars Lionel Atwill ( doing what he does so well , portraying diabolical scientists with evil intent ) as an insanely jealous , very wealthy , big game hunter . . and animal scientist / zoologist . . Eric Gorman , who supplies zoo's with wild life he finds on safari trips , and his grisly actions towards those who dare desire to seduce his wife , Evelyn ( Kathleen Burke ) . In the opening of this film , he actually sows a man's mouth shut ( ! ) for attempting to kiss Evelyn , leaving the man to be food for the wild .

Charles Ruggles is perhaps the film's weak link , a bumbling , alcoholic press agent , Peter Yates , who is supposed to be the comic relief , but he provides a diversion which breaks the intense spell this has . Without Ruggles , the film provides a tour-de-force performance for Lionel Atwill channeling the same kind of malevolent and quietly deranged characters he'd often portray on screen . This is the perfect vehicle for Atwill , and he provides the film with a loathsome villain to root against . For Atwill fans ( . . like myself ) this is a must-see . His final scene , after releasing lions and tigers from their cages , is a doozy !
436026	9938570	65856	8.0	House of Dark Shadows	Dan Curtis , not as bound by restrictions regarding censorship and budget , brings the recurring storyline of centuries-old vampire Barnabas Collins and the tragic consequences of his presence and predatory behavior from the television soap opera to the big screen and shows that he has an eye for atmosphere , menace and dread in this Gothic melodrama . Nearly every important cast member either dies or is turned into a vampire as Barnabas seeks to make Maggie Evans ( . . the lovely Kathryn Leigh Scott , who has a great pair of legs ) as his bride for she resembles the love of his life who committed suicide when she found that he was indeed a vampire . Chained in a coffin and sealed await in a secret crypt by his father , Barnabas is freed by a slimy , greedy employee for the Collins / Stoddard family , Willie Loomis ( John Karlen ) looking for a precious necklace . Dr . Julia Hoffman ( Grayson Hall ) , a physician called upon by family matriarch Elizabeth Collins Stoddard ( . . Joan Bennett , who is actually underused in the film ) to help solve the violent attack of a female employee , along with scholarly Professor T Eliot Stokes ( Thayer David ) , has studied the blood of the victim , believing she can cure Barnabas , subsequently falling in love with him during the healing process . Barnabas bites a family member , Roger Collins ' ( Louis Edmonds ) daughter Carolyn ( Nancy Barrett ) who in turn bears her fangs into her beau after being laid to rest . Jealous of the budding romance between Barnabas and Maggie ( . . her fiancé , Jeff , played by Roger Davis who becomes the hero once nearly the entire family has been turned into vampires , is away at Boston ) , Julia deliberately causes an increase in the serum dosage given to the vampire causing him to age into an old man . His identity discovered Barnabas will cause death and destruction towards anyone who dare stop him from making Maggie his bride . Karlen's Willie is his Renfield-like slave who must do as ordered by his master . Most of the cast from the soap opera at the time have a role in the movie , but this is Jonathan Frid's movie all the way . His tragic vampire actually walks during the day and is almost cured when Hoffman's betrayal causes devastating consequences leading to many unforeseen demises . Great locations selected by Curtis , old places with history , such as Collinwood , enhance the film but those familiar with the show will notice that the themes of the movie are depicted on there . Except in the movie's case the stories culminate within a certain amount of time instead of the lengthening of months on a soap opera . The film follows the basic familiar customs of Dracula . Crosses , objects plunged into the heart , mirrors not reflecting the vampire's image , are depicted in this film . I felt Curtis was really inspired , having this golden opportunity to fill his screen with graphic vampire killings and bloody fang wounds on the neck . Nancy Barrett is quite impressive as a vampire victim in a flowing white gown wishing to bite a kid relative , David Collins ( David Henesy ) while pursuing to bury her fangs in the neck of her boyfriend so he can share eternity with her . Curtis does show signs of a new filmmaker honing his skills , so music can be abrupt scene to scene and his camera-work at times can be a bit dodgy . But , there are also some astounding uses of the camera , like his shot from below Barrett as she bites her beau for the first time shooting up at her face , exposing fangs with a blood thirst so evident . The finale has my favorite set-piece inside a castle in ruin , the only place left for Barnabas to complete his wedding ceremony , featuring the terrific use of a wooden arrow from a cross-bow . I think this is a definite must for fans of the show , Curtis gave his audience exactly what they wanted . Great closing shot of a fallen Frid as the camera pulls away through the damaged hole of the dilapidated castle . The amazing backstory regarding how the cast were tirelessly working on both the show and this movie is a testament to hard work paying off !
435924	9938570	58567	8.0	Blood and Black Lace	Models employed at a fashion shop are being offed one by one as a killer , donning black hat , gloves , and coat ( while also covering the face with a stocking ) searches for a diary of the first victim Isabella . That diary is of interest to most of the cast which paints the idea in our heads that any number of people might have an excuse to send Isabella to an early grave . This film is known as the model for future gialli ( Italian slashers ) with it's face-less killer coming from behind unknowing victims who have no idea that someone awaits them in the dark , quietly just out of sight to end them . This film , in my opinion , is style and color over substance . The story and the unveiling of killer ( s ) are merely okay if not too extraordinary . It's the way Bava sets up the sequences where the killer attacks , Bava doesn't seem to take an easy way out when it comes to framing a shot . Bava uses outside light as it flashes into rooms ( . . buildings ) superbly adding atmosphere to the proceedings . The pacing can be sluggish at times . . I have to admit there were moments where I was getting antsy . But , I just took in Bava's exceptional ability to artistically convey more in a scene than just a character running from another trying to kill her . It's the way Bava frames the prey and hunter . . how we are thrusted beautifully into the terror on their faces . The violence is also eye-popping considering when it was made . . sadistic with some nasty weaponry .
436566	9938570	58405	8.0	Nightmare	A teenage girl has an awful recurring nightmare of being trapped in an insane asylum cell with her sick mother who murdered dear old daddy on the poor child's birthday . Janet deeply fears of not only winding up at an asylum like in her nightmares , but the possibility of inheriting mother's murdering ways . Wishing to return home after staying at an all-girls private school , Janet ( Jennie Linden , who is indeed excellent as the traumatized girl ) is haunted by this woman with a slight scar on her face . Always trying to get away from her , this constant image of the woman laid on her back with a knife protruding from the chest lies at the heart of Janet's slow descent into madness . It all leads to the death of Janet's doctor , Henry's ( David Knight ) wife when she is a spitting image of the woman that haunts her nightmares . There's much more to this story than meets the eye , however , as we see that someone close to Janet was using her trauma as a weapon . Through Freddie Francis ' startlingly eerie , moody B & W photography , we see the nightmarish realm Janet's trapped in . It doesn't end there as the film takes a detour that can be a bit jarring at first , but comes together by the end . " Nightmare " is one of those films which starts out one place then takes the viewer into a totally different direction . This film is a lot of fun .
436711	9938570	76590	8.0	Rabid	After a " successful " skin grafting experimental plastic surgery ( using tissue not only for outside work , but inside as well using skin from the thigh ) , innocent , sweet Rose ( Marilyn Chambers who is actually not bad in a rare dramatic role ; she still looks incredibly sexy and bares her breasts often , however ) has a mysterious appendage that pops out from a " pouch " on her arm pit . This appendage likes to suck blood from unknowing victims and is the only nutritious substance Rose can digestively hold down . Rose has constant cravings and those she attacks become bloodthirsty , stark-raving maniacs whose mouth splatter green pus . Soon the entire city of Montreal , Quebec has reached epidemic-proportions with the military having to step in to control the problem . There seems to be no cure available except death to all that have the " plague " ( after a while , the diseased crazies go into a coma and die ) . Rose's boyfriend Hart ( Frank Moore ) tries to find her once she breaks from the clinic after attacking Dr . Keloid ( Howard Ryshpan ) . . the plastic surgeon who worked on her . Poor Mindy ( Susan Roman ) offers Rose a place to stay , but unknowingly has the very one responsible for the outbreak of madness . You watch wondering when the impulses for blood will take effect leaving Rose with only one alternative and that is to attack her only real friend in the world . Will Mindy survive ? Will Hart find Rose ? The tragic part about the film is that there's really only one way to cease the plague sweeping the city ( . . and before it reaches the entire country ) and that is to eliminate the model source . . the queen bee . . and that is extinguishing Rose . The film is a bit raw ( Cronenberg was still honing his skills ) , but it's clear with this icky epidemic thriller he was on his way to greater things . The unpleasant premise of this thing inside Rose sucking blood might be ridiculous , but , at the same time , it really gets under the skin . It seems like Cronenberg could make these spine-tingling grotesques in his sleep .
436570	9938570	492754	8.0	Salvage	Teenager " Claire " ( cutie Lauren Currie Lewis ) is continuously haunted by the prolonging image of a supposedly dead psychopath named Duke Desmond ( Chris Ferry ) who worked in a salvage yard . He was shot dead by Detective Miller ( John P Miller ) when attempting the firing of his pistol . Duke is known for hacking up a male teenager . This film applies the oft-used gimmick of looping . . the theme where certain things recur over and over . I'm not giving away nothing because the twist is good fun . Most of the film is poor Claire caught in a disorienting state of fear , often trying to flee from her predator who often appears in the background . We do see Claire having conversations with her boyfriend Jimmy ( Cody Darbe ) as if life is continuing on with the image of Duke just an overwhelming nightmare , but when he starts appearing in reality that's one the real fear starts creeping into her mind . Also , we see her with mother ( Maureen Olander ) a bit also . It does seem like Claire does momentarily awake from her nightmare , only to realize that it all seems to start back up again once she's attacked viciously by Duke . I really liked this flick . A horror sleeper if there ever was one . The film feels like one long continuing nightmare that never ceases . Besides rock music every once in a while calming things a bit , the film uses a particularly effective eerie set of pounding piano strings among other thumping sounds to provide just that extra inch of intensity . A word of warning . . while this flick depends more on suspense than gore , there's a nasty face-peeling , from a curving blade , that might not be recommended for the squeamish .
436657	9938570	783238	8.0	The Dead Girl	Lives are examined revolving around a dead young woman's corpse laying in a deserted valley in California . The woman that finds her , Arden ( Toni Collette ) is awaken from the morose existence of taking care of her vile , viciously scathing , unappreciative mother ( Piper Laurie who lets loose that nasty streak she always explodes forth so well ) . Arden soon meets a grocery bagger , Rudy ( Giovaani Ribisi ) , a rough-looking fellow with an obsession for serial killer cases , who desires her and which might provide a way out of the life she's stuck in . Leah ( Rose Byrne , whose stunning beauty is so well displayed off such a saddened exterior ) is a young college student who checks corpses for shavings under the nails and such , burdened by the misery of a missing sister ( been missing for around fifteen years ) and the parents who hold onto hope every single day that she'll be found . Taking anti-depressants and sleeping the days away when not at school , Leah believes she has found her missing sister who carries a specific birthmark which her own had in between the fingers . She feels , despite the horrible way the dead girl died , this weight has been lifted from so many years of her mother's ( Mary Steenburgen , doing so much with such a limited role ) constant universe involving the search and find of her daughter . It leads Rudy to the embracing of life accepting an invitation by a classmate , Derek ( James Franco ) to his party and opening the doors to an intimate relationship . There's finally an opportunity here , after closure of finding her sister's body , for feeling other emotions other than despair and grief . But , this girl may not be who Leah was hoping her to be . . Probably the most disturbing vignette has a concerned frustrated wife , Ruth ( Mary Beth Hurt with the best role she has had in ages ) finding that her husband Carl ( Nick Searcy ) may just be the serial killer everyone is looking for when she discovers " trophies " in a dresser located in what was supposed to be an empty storage shed ( they work at a storage business ) . What will she do if her frightening intuitions are correct ? Go to the proper authorities or sit on her hands as he continues to go out for days at a time possibly plotting and committing ghoulish acts of murder towards innocent women . Melora ( Marcia Gay Harden ) has been looking for her runaway daughter for sometime now , but when she does find her it's not exactly the reunion she had hoped . Finding a file with her daughter's police report containing information regarding her whereabouts before the crimes that took her life , Melora discovers a friend / lover , Rosetta ( Kerry Washington , in a stunning performance ) who has seen the cruelties of life first-hand . Melora finds , through Rosetta things about her daughter's unfortunate tough road in LA and the granddaughter she never knew about . We also find out about what caused Melora's daughter to run away . . Finally , we relive the final moments of the dead girl's life , Krista ( Brittany Murphy exposing how gifted an actress she truly is with the right part ) who just wants to get to Norwalk , a location where her daughter lives before the child's birthday commences . First , she's betrayed by a client ( Josh Brolin , looking like a trucker with tattoos covering his arms and such ) who promises to take her after some , umm , compensation . Then she retaliates towards Rosetta's beating at the hands of her pimp by destroying his vehicle and attacking him . But , when a motorcycle she borrows quits on her road back , Krista will need a ride . The ride she receives is with Carl who promises to take her to Norwalk after a stop . . Jarring , powerfully acted drama , potently performed by a great cast who give their all to the characters displaying how cruel and gruelingly emotional life can be . It's incredibly down-beat and depressing , it'll make you want to put a gun in your mouth , but yet so full of truth in a non-pretentious way . There are decisions each make that will change lives forever . The one that shook me up the most was the one with Mary Beth Hurt who almost turns her husband in , but has a change of heart . . what she does with possible evidence is haunting . But , the entire film is gripping even when we know what happens to Krista .
435933	9938570	60228	8.0	Chamber of Horrors	An aristocratic , sociopathic strangler , Cravatte ( Patrick O'Neal , evoking the spirit of Vincent Price with his quietly mad psychopath and demented eyes ) in Baltimore ( . . who removes his handcuffed hand , which was locked to a steel wheel , with an ax after escaping from a train into the sea below a bridge ) hides out in New Orleans under a different name , choosing a stunning streetwalker to assist ( . . unknown to her ; she thinks it's a blackmailing scam ) him in a series of vengeful crimes retaliating on the key figures who planned to send the killer to the gallows . The true motivation , besides his insanity , that provides him with the desire to kill is the loss of his hand for which he blames the ones who caught him , for being " responsible " for his trauma . The detective team of the debonair , sophisticated sleuth Anthony Draco ( Cesare Danova , with his Italian looks and charm ) and his protégé , the cerebral criminologist Harold Blount ( the delightful , incredibly likable , unflappable Wilfrid Hyde-White ) , along with side-kick dwarf assistant Pepe ( José René Ruiz ) , will join forces with local law enforcers Inspector Matthew Strudwick ( Philip Bourneuf ) , at first resisting them as mere amateurs until they help capture the killer at the insistence of Cravatte's blustery , cigar chomping Mrs . Perryman ( Jeanette Nolan , chewing scenery as a wealthy multi-married voice of authority , whose monetary contributions and prestigious name certainly carry an influence ) , and Sgt . Jim Albertson ( Wayne Rogers ) . What makes this Holmes / Watson type sleuthing team so unique is , when they aren't helping their peers solve crimes , that they run a wax museum whose exhibits are based on notorious murderers , their victims & devices . If you want a proper description of what the film looks and feels like , imagine if William Castle directed a Hammer film . Baltimore is akin to the fog-infested , cobble-stone streets of London . With macabre humor , some lurid elements regarding Cravatte's dwelling places and selection of " adventuress " women , the deranged methods for which the killer does in his victims ( . . Cravatte uses an assortment of weapons , such as a meat cleaver , surgical knife , and gun , hooked on to a device he ordered connecting to where his missing hand use to be ) , the House of Wax setting which never gets old , and a spirited cast who add extra fun to the sordid atmosphere of the premise . For a film made for a television audience , this is a good looking production . . . . great sets , costumes , use of shadow , and professional camera-work . Director Hy Averback might be looked at as a hack , because his film seems so similar to other directors and companies churning out these type of films at the time but his smörgåsbord of ideas and styles impressed the hell out of me . I think a lot of horror aficionado / buffs will have fun with this one . I think some might penalize this for not being too original . The " House of Wax " setting , which I've always been a fan of , really provides some very amusing bits not to mention the final showdown between our hero and the killer , especially in how Cravatte meets his end . But , the setting has been used before . The killer's affliction , by his own hand , and how he murders folks , has been seen before . . the idea of a hook-handed killer doesn't exactly seem fresh , even at that time in 1966 . And , many might find the two gimmicks of the " fear flash " and " horror horn " , which were all the rage back then , rather hokey . I dunno . . I find these gimmicks an amusing part of a cinema from yesteryear . While the story is indeed a wicked one , it's still a film made with a television's audience in mind , so sadly the violent elements are tame , off-screen stuff . Marie Windsor , as a brothel's Madame who lends her place to Cravatte as a hideout because he pays well , and Tony Curtis as a card-playing client in the Red Light District , have small roles .
435985	9938570	62185	8.0	Reflections in a Golden Eye	Major Weldon Penderton ( Marlon Brando ) is grappling with buried homosexuality that awakens lustfully when he becomes enamored with an enlisted soldier ( Robert Forster ) working as a stable-hand for his horses . Penderton is bottled in an unhappy marriage to Leonora ( Liz Taylor , great as always ) who can be loud and overbearing , not to mention grating . Leonora has been having a sexual affair with Lt . Col . Morris Langdon ( Brian Keith ) while they ride off on horseback . Morris is also in an unhappy marriage to deeply troubled , fragile Alison ( Julie Harris ) still having a hard time coming to terms with the death of her child shortly after birth . She passes her sad days with Anacleto ( Zorro David ) , her servant boy who certainly represents a joke to the Army men around the area for it's obvious he's homosexual ( he dances around a room to classical music and paints with watercolors ) , but incredibly devoted to Alison . Alison has known for some time that her husband is cheating , but it takes courage to finally threaten a divorce . Morris clearly loves her , but the passion in their marriage has been gone for some time and Leonora fills that void . Meanwhile , the stable-boy Private has become obsessed with Leonora every since seeing her naked body as he stared through the window outside . The Private is indeed a voyeur who seems fixated on the Penderton's home , and he takes chances of being caught as he sneaks into Leonora's room at night smelling her perfume , staring longingly at her , and going through her underclothes . But , through all of this film , it's Weldon himself who is busting at the seams , showing the imprisoned torture his silence regarding his sexuality causes . The film balances all this drama rather effectively in an absolutely fascinating stew that shows how relationships begin to crumble when everyone hides buried iniquities from each other . Each character longs for someone else , yet inside the prison of military pride and honor , every secret goes unheard despite what everyone truly feels . Death ( as rumored at the start of the film ) will certainly occur in an act of violence that seems to be one things to the outside world , but inside that person behind it knows exactly why those shots will be fired . The film , through all the circumstances and betrayals that occur , is certainly set-up for tragedy because no one can follow how they really feel repressing their passions in " quiet " which will only boil over eventually .
436352	9938570	69341	8.0	Tales from the Crypt	" Who's next ? Perhaps . . YOU ? " Ralph Richardson , under a cloak , prophetically releases five people into their possible future fates as we watch each tale one by one . The first tale has the perfect murder spoiled . Joanne Clayton ( Joan Collins , cold and calculatingly evil , but quite stunningly beautiful ) faces quite a dilemma . . she has murdered her husband ( . . for cold , hard cash , of course . . during Christmas Eve , no less , as her daughter rests in bed up stairs ! ) , but finds that a nut case , disguised as Old Saint Nick , has escaped an asylum and is snooping around her house . She would normally call the cops , of course , but there's the dead corpse in her living room . But , daughter is upstairs waiting for Santa with bated breath , as mommy cleans up her mess . What's a little girl to do when she knows that the one she's been waiting for is just outside . . The second tale depicts the events that transpire to Carl Maitland ( Ian Hendry ) who decides to kiss his wife and kids goodbye , leaving them for another women and finds that a car crash will change his plans forever . . The third tale shows what pure greed and class disregard fuels when James Elliot ( Robin Phillips ) , longing for the property of kindly Arthur Edward Grimsdyke ( Peter Cushing ) who is beloved by children ( . . he finds trashed toys in the rubbish heap , fixing them for the kiddies ) and often speaks with his late-departed wife through a Ouija board . Elliot , for kicks & out of scorn , begins manipulating certain folks ( . . like city officials and the children's parents ) which slowly ruins Grimsdyke's life . His dogs are removed , the children are told to stay away , and he is sent cruel Valentine's Day cards which ultimately end his life with a broken heart . Yet , Elliot hasn't heard the last of Grimsdyke . . . The fourth tale is a gleefully sadistic variation on THE MONKEY'S PAW in regards to a businessman whose finances have hit the skids . Faced with having to sell his prized possessions , Ralph Jason ( Richard Greene ) and his wife Enid ( Barbara Murray ) try their luck with a statuette that grants wishes they picked up in Hong Kong . . with horrifying results . The fifth tale has a group of blind men , who live together in a government-functioned home , revolting against their selfish director , Maj William Rogers ( Nigel Patrick ) , for bad living conditions , little to eat , and the death of one of their own . Rogers is the kind of bloke who sticks his nose up at the blind under his watch deeming them inferior and living with all the refinements they lack . Along with his trusty dog , the blind , whose leader is George Carter ( Patrick Magee ) , subdue Rogers , placing both in closed rooms down in the home's basement . . they begin construction and Rogers will find himself confined having without ( . . and his trusty dog won't be so loving to it's master ) . Each tale has it's macabre elements , but you'll notice that the protagonists whose fates are beheld before them were responsible for misdeeds against their fellow man . And , the fun is seeing Richardson damning them . I personally love the last two , because they end so magnificently . . although , I found it a bit far-fetched that the blind men could construct such an elaborate prison for Rogers . The fourth one is particularly ghoulish because wishes granted , if committed to satisfy avarice carelessly , can lead to dire consequences . That and we get to see guts . Love the " poetic justice " for Elliot and seeing Cushing rise from the grave is the most memorable image I take away from this particular Amicus anthology .
435882	9938570	88944	8.0	Commando	The Schwarzenegger answer to Stallone's Rambo is John Matrix , an ex-commando ( . . the best there is , of course ) , retired under a new name living comfortably with his daughter Jenny ( Alyssa Milano , adorably cute as his kid ) , forced back into service when an ex-partner , Bennett ( Vernon Wells , wonderfully over-the-top and slimy ; the perfect antithesis to Schwarzenegger ) betrays him for kicking him off his unit for uncontrollably bloodthirsty behavior in the field . Bennett assists a sadistic and cruel overthrown political leader ( . . in some unnamed Latin country , of which doesn't matter ) , Arius ( Dan Hedaya , perfectly malicious ) in finding John's whereabouts , proposing that he must kill the established figurehead who replaced him or Jenny will be " sent to him in pieces " . Those responsible for this operation are in for a world of hurt as Matrix , boarding the plane towards the destination of the ordered murder , will establish his own grand plan to eliminate each member of this scheme , understanding that he has only a number of hours to get to Jenny before Bennett kills her . That so begins the body count . Of course , these movies have a co-starring female civilian who gets caught in the mix , and that role went to Rae Dawn Chong , as Cindy , a flight attendant Sully ( David Patrick Kelly , cleaned up , but still a scumbag ) , one of the crooks working for Arius in the states , takes a shine to . Matrix only plans to gain her assistance in keeping Sully busy until he can get information to where Arius and Bennett are located , but , of course , things get out of hand and she's flung into the developing operation . Cindy even helps out Matrix later because of her " skills " ( . . she's taking flight school ) as an amateur pilot . Heck , during Matrix's " shopping spree " commandeering weapons and arsenal from a gun store , Cindy actually rescues him from potential prison time thanks to a rocket launcher ! Bill Duke has a small role as Cooke , a heavy Matrix battles in hand-to-hand combat who also works for Arius in the states and knows where Jenny is located . One by one all associated to Arius will meet their doom at the hands of Matrix as he heads for the fiends heavily guarded fortress , with weapons and arsenal , prepared for war . James Olson is Major General Franklin Kirby , essentially fulfilling the Colonel Trautman role from Rambo , as the man who trained Matrix and knows his capabilities as a soldier . Cartoonish , ridiculous action film I'm sure repelled critics at the time because Matrix is an absolute killing machine . No one that attempts aggression against him lasts very long . The hysterical mall sequence where Matrix chases after Sully will have you in ribbons it's so unbelievable ( . . he literally lifts up a phone booth with Sully in it , hurling it in the air and to the floor , while also wiping out a group of policemen and mall security ) as is the climax where he's successfully able to gun down and blow to smithereens an army of heavily equipped baddies shooting non-stop . Explosions galore and many a man is dropped by gunfire and knives to their torsos . In a startlingly violent sequence , Matrix , inside a tool shed , stabs a soldier in the chest with a rake , cuts an arm off with a machete , and takes the top of another's head off with a thrown saw blade ! The pace blazes by because of Matrix hasn't got but hours to figure out where his daughter is and to get to her . Rae Dawn Chong has some very realistic responses to the madness and violence around her , and her zingers are just as funny as the usual Arnie one-liners once destroying a foe . Perfectly 80's , there's a clear definition of who is the hero and villains . Arnie's role is larger than life . . a muscular Adonis whose immune to bullets no matter how many people are shooting at him . And , he's equipped with supernatural power , with an ability to carry a large log on his shoulder , can rip doors off hinges , and break apart locked chains . . as does Bennett , who , in a very amusing scene throws his body through a wood-padded wall right after Jenny had removed a portion of it ( . . this obviously , for her , took a while ) with a door knob . If you are to like an action film such as this , you positively have to suspend disbelief , because it operates without real logic . . and I love this movie for that .
435956	9938570	89034	8.0	The Doctor and the Devils	" Up the alley and down the street Fallon and Broom sell bones and meat . Fallon's a butcher and Broom's a thief . And Rock's the boy that buys the beef . " At the film's closing , Dr . Thomas Rock ( Timothy Dalton ) proclaims that he has become a ghost story that frightens children and questioned how it had gotten so far . A revisionist take on " The Body Snatcher " ( . . a marvelous film produced by Val Lewton ) , this film has Dalton portraying a scientist whose skills in anatomy are unsurpassed thanks to his intense study of dead bodies . The law prohibits Rock from using fresh corpses for his research so all he has to use are rotted corpses brought in by grave robbers or criminals hung or animals . He soon enlists the aid of graverobbers Fallon and Broom ( Jonathan Pryce and Stephen Rea ) to bring him fresh bodies for proper research not knowing they are supplying him with victims they murder . Julian Sands plays Dr . Murray , Rock's assistant , who falls in love with a prostitute named Jennie ( Twiggy ) and discovers when he goes to see her how Broom and Fallon get their corpses so fresh . The whole business of delivered bodies provides a special moral dilemma within the story ( . . which worked quite well in " The Body Snatcher " ) . Also , the film is quite an indictment on the plight of impoverished " squalor " who lie slowly dying in the streets and alleyways or drift slowly into the abyss of alcoholism . Director Fisher's camera doesn't shy away from the less fortunate as the film seems to show us first-hand their suffering . Dalton's doctor is actually the sympathetic figure in the film in regards to his recognizing the poverty that his colleagues and peers seem to either ignore or just care not to acknowledge . He honestly desires fresh bodies so that he can make a difference in the advancement of the medical profession moving it from the dark Ages to the 19th Century . It's just unfortunate he has to resort to paying graverobbers for specimens . But , the film does recognize ( . . like in " The Body Snatcher " ) that Rock knew very well that some of his specimens may've been attained beyond reasonable means . Thomas ' sister provides a detrimental problem to the furtherance of his work as she believes his ways are the works of the devil . His wife is also seen as immoral by the sister for she artistically portraits anatomical charts of the human body . Others question Thomas ' work as well , specifically Prof . Macklin ( Patrick Stewart , whose role and character is underwritten ) who wishes for his unusual methods to be grounds for dismissal . The major moral crisis , though , comes when a deranged Fallon attempts to murder Jennie and is sought after by Dr . Murray where Rock's illegal researching in accepting bodies murdered might soon be discovered . While he only wishes to advance anatomy to save lives , his accepting murdered bodies is indeed considered immoral and unlawful . While the material of the film might seem familiar , considering it just really feels like a remake of " The Body Snatcher " and is just difficult not to think of the previous film while watching " The Doctor and the Devils " , Fisher's marvelous direction makes up for it . Unlike his Hammer years , Fisher doesn't have to hold back . He isn't held down by restrictions and can display the cruel realities of life such as the squalor in the streets as the epidemic it was . The period cinematography feels fresh and completely genuine . It is quite grim and bleak which might put off many with no hope seemingly in sight for many in this film . Fisher keeps the film , for most of the way , on the dreaded streets so that we have a hard time looking away from the truth .
435873	9938570	758742	8.0	Death Note	Ultra-slick , ingeniously plotted crime fantasy ( . . based on a popular anime ) stars Tatsuya Fujiwara as a college kid , Light Yagami who gains possession of a " death book " accidentally dropped by the god of death ( . . a computer generated angel of death who carries the appearance of a heavy metal rock star with long , outstretched feathery wings ) who follows directions which teach him methods at killing criminals merely by writing their names down after heavily studying and memorizing their faces ( . . often from news broadcasts or educating himself through entering the police's documented computer files ) . The god of death follows Light from place to place watching him work often questioning his decisions regarding his murderous activities and human choices to die . At first , Light , known to the citizens as Kira , picks out solely criminals of all sorts , having them die by heart attacks , but when the Tokyo's finest work ( . . including Light's own father played by Shunji Fujimura ) with the mysterious ghost agent L ( Ken'ichi Matsuyama ) , begin a task force in stopping Kira from committing his attacks towards victims from all over the city , he'll go rogue , targeting innocents who threaten to expose him . FBI agent Raye ( Shigeki Hosokawa ) is the first , who is following him , targeted as they exchange identities when a bus they are traveling is taken control by a killer-on-the-lam . After Light rids himself of the killer through a brilliant course of action using a sheet of paper torn from his book of death , he will find out the agent's name and soon inherit knowledge of the covert team set to find him . When Raye , along with his FBI associates , is eliminated , his former agent fiancé Naomi Misori ( Asaka Seto ) will set her sights on catching him . When the Tokyo task is depleted due to fear , Light's father and those that remain will meet face-to-face with L and continue their efforts to find Kira . But , Light has a few aces up his sleeve even when L has cameras set up all throughout his room , as part of an operation to study the families of those who might could gain access to specific files and are smart enough to commit such deeds as Kira is continuing . Yu Kashii is Shiori Kashino , Light's love interest who becomes an unfortunate victim caught in the middle of her boyfriend's adventures . I must say that I watched this flick through word of mouth and was pleasantly surprised at how gripping and entertaining it was . A bit far-fetched ( . . of course , we must not forget what inspired it , a comic book tale where intelligent young men duel it out through a cat-and-mouse game while lives are at stake ) so the viewer will have to go out on the limb with the filmmakers as the film stretched credibility quite a bit . It's very much a fantasy with a strong morality tale at the heart of it . . how a man gains control of a power he shouldn't possess , playing judge , executioner and jury until he himself is threatened . Light becomes the very person he executes just to save his own skin . L is quite a creation , a teen prodigy ; a genius who loves candy and has a firm grasp on using the information superhighway , and our current technology , to find criminals good , old police-work can not detect . The addition of Light being the Tokyo task force's main detective's son only heightens the drama . He must watch his son's activities thanks to bug-camera devices planted all throughout the room and house . The god of death , and his addiction to apples , are used as a source of comedy and a voice questioning the reasoning of our killer , whose cold and calculating decisions effect innocent lives and families . There are serious repercussions when Light decides to murder those who threaten to expose him . It doesn't surprise me that Hollywood plans to remake this because " Death Note " is such an imaginative little feature with some very fascinating ideas lacking in our modern fantasies on these shores .
436578	9938570	27545	8.0	Dracula's Daughter	The title character is Countess Marya Zaleska played by the stunning Gloria Holden . Edward Van Sloan's Von Helsing has been arrested by the authorities for killing Dracula . Scotland Yard thinks his claims of vampire slaying is preposterous . Von Helsing calls on psychiatrist Jeffrey Garth ( played by Otto Kruger ) to assist him in trying to persuade others that he isn't insane . Soon , at a party where Zaleska ( who paints as a profession ) is invited , she meets Garth and hopes he can cure her of the affliction to drink the blood of victims . Soon , Zaleska desires to have Garth as her undead lover , and will use his secretary Janet ( the feisty , fetching Marguerite Churchill ) as leverage . Zaleska has this hulking brute Sandor ( portrayed by the brooding Irving Pichel ) to assist her . Zaleska wishes to be cured , and tests herself at Garth's command when she gets Sandor to bring a beautiful , down-on-her-luck model to the studio for a painting . In my favorite scene , it's hinted that the Countess might go both ways as she eyeballs the model's smooth , porcelain skin ready to have a drink . It certainly charged my motor , that's for sure . Anyway , soon Garth will have to face off with the Countess at Transylvania in the climax where a rejected and jealous Sandor will seek revenge for being pushed aside by his master . I really , really like this sequel to Dracula , but others might find it slow and uninvolving . I thought it was original and atmospheric . But , Holden is the reason I recommend it . She had this hold on me that's hard to explain . . she cuts the ravishing figure when the camera pulls back on her in a late scene where she requests / demands for Garth to become her lover . Edward Van Sloan only plays a minor part here , more or less , a guide to others about the abilities of vampires .
435931	9938570	105527	8.0	Tale of a Vampire	Alex ( Julian Sands ) , a vampire who often frequents a library , finds that a newly hired clerk , Anne ( Suzanna Hamilton ) resembles a long lost love , Virginia , sparking up a desire for relations with her . A mysterious intruder named Edgar ( Kenneth Cranham ) who persuasively ignites dinner conversations with Anne , attempts to warn her of Alex , because she indeed is attracted to him . There are unresolved deaths plaguing the London streets , and we watch as Alex pursues his victims , unable to halt the blood thirst his nature so requires . More of a doomed Gothic romance set in gloomy modern London where the fog still lives and breathes at night as Alex stalks the streets for his prey , and his feeding can be quite messy . I fell in love with how director Shimako Sato builds the mood of this tale , using blue , the way light is reflected and produced , rain , graffiti walls , the crumbling walls of Alex's dilapidated dwelling , & various other London locales which seem the perfect background of our vampire's existence and anguish . Sands , who facial features and hanging shoulders has him resembling a droopy lost puppy seeking refuge and a kind heart , I thought was perfect in the lead as Alex . I also liked how Sato often captures Sands , quietly emerging from a dark corner . . while quite a sympathetic figure thanks in part to Sands work , he's also a brooding menace . I've always liked those vampire tales which display a lonely figure , melancholy , yearning for someone taken away , whose craving for human blood is so insatiable he's almost beast-like . I think that works well in this film . . showing how Sato's camera seductively captures Sands ' , a handsome smallish man , whose not all that imposing , turn savage when it's time to feed , such as one scene where he throws a victim up against a wall , crushing his skull , lifting the poor soul above him with blood scattering throughout his face and lips . Another scene shows Alex caressing a wayward cat before sinking his teeth into it's furry neck . We even get a dream sequence where Alex is drinking the blood from Anne's cut finger , as he plunges on top of her , biting into her neck , drinking her blood . Cranham as Edgar is scholarly while quite imposing and straight-forward , often abrupt while also , at the same time , keeping secrets with a darkness behind his eyes . Even when Edgar informs Anne of who Alex really is , it seems like an agenda is always present as if this air of animosity drives / motivates him . Who Edgar really is heightens the despair and angst of Alex's loneliness . I felt Hamilton provides a moving performance as Anne ( . . and Virginia ) using subtlety instead of melodramatics . Like Alex , Anne is a lonely-heart as well , having lost someone dear to her as well . The idea of having someone you love snatched away and the fear of dying , yet living all alone are themes I felt really make this film work well . Not critically acclaimed , I think it's one hell of a vampire film .
436054	9938570	489270	8.0	Live or die . Make your choice	Jigsaw John ( Tobin Bell ) and his protégé Amanda ( Shawnee Smith ) are up to their old tricks , but in this third film ( and my favorite of the series ) there are some surprises I didn't see coming . On " trial " is Jeff ( Angus Macfadyen , who is blessed with a face and talent that can express all sorts of emotion ) , an emotionally unstable man , full of booze , wrath & pain , consumingly overwhelmed by the loss of his son in a car crash . The driver responsible was released shortly after thanks to a hasty trial with pretty much a slap on the wrist that might change a many of us who might have this same type of bitterness and rage if it happened to us ( or , at least I put myself in his shoes ) . The other important character in Jigsaw and Amanda's new game is a female doctor named Lynn ( Bahar Soomekh , another really great choice for the film . . this film is a success in my eyes because the casting excels ) who might be able to prolong his life among other things . Jeff must complete a series of games in less than two hours or face being shut inside the building . Each game consists of those certain people who played intricate roles in or around his son's demise ( the woman who , instead of assisting Jeff as he held his dying son , drove off ; the judge who gave the murderer a slap on the wrist ; the killer himself ) . Jeff has their lives in his hands . He can forgive or let them perish in Jigsaw and Amanda's crafted killing apparatuses . Meanwhile , Lynn has a metal collar , with chambered bullets , that is linked to Jigsaw's heart-rate . Her duty is to not let him die or else the bullets will fire right into her face . Also important is Amanda's role ( what she does know and doesn't know . . Jigsaw has prepared this whole game for a major purpose to be determined ) in the grand scheme of things . She will determine the outcome just as much as Jeff . . and not even know it ! The film does lots of things this go-around , delving into how Amanda formed her partnership with Jigsaw , the loose ends untied from the second film regarding Eric ( Donnie Wahlberg ) will be finalized , and we actually see how Jigsaw prepared the test of the two male characters in the first film . These " flashbacks " regarding Amanda are crucial to the development of the film and it's climax . Like the previous two films , this one works off of some coincidences provided by a screenplay that needs certain characters to die ( or suffer ) at the right moment before they can be saved , or a certain character saved who just happens to be in a specific place to be shot by a shotgun . I'm not convinced anyone could put together such elaborately designed games without something going awry , but this like the other two is orchestrated by a screenplay writer with devious intentions for his created characters . We see that Amanda has created games that give those tested no way to survive which is not Jigsaw's method . This film is also the most grisly and gruesome of the three showing one unfortunate victim ( caught in Jigsaw's favorite contraption , " The Twister " ) having his arms , legs , and head completely twisted around as bones snap out of the skin like broken wood . The ultimate goal of Jigsaw is choices and forgiveness . Can Jeff make the right choice and forgive those who have caused him so much agony ? There are many who might be able to pick this apart with a fined tooth comb , but I just enjoyed it despite acknowledging that no one is that skillful enough to get away with what the film's death-geniuses do .
435858	9938570	468492	9.0	The Host	A member of the US military orders his Korean counterpart to unload lots of formaldehyde ( bottles upon bottles ) into the Han River of Seoul with a type of enormous mutated marine life form emerging as a result . In the opening of this film , a mass of people at the banks of the Han River are attacked by the monster as it rampages . Hyun-seo ( Ah-sung Ko ) is abducted by the monster and taken to a pit inside a certain sewer system with her father Gang-Du ( Kang-ho Song ) " infected " with the monster's blood supposedly when it is cut during the attack on an American . That American contracted some sort of virus which sends the government into an uproar with Gang-Du and his family quarantined . When Gang-Du receives a cell-phone call from his daughter , he'll try to break free with his family to find her wherever she may possibly be . We watch as poor Hyun-seo struggles to come up with a plan of escape as another little boy is dropped into the pit with her . . the monster begins dumping bodies there while also using it as a hideaway and sleeping spot . With the government and medical personnel all over the place ( not to mention police looking for them ) Gang-Du and his family will search endlessly for their beloved Hyun-seo . When Gang-Du is recaptured after a tragedy towards his father , we also see a very destructive paranoia towards a supposed virus develop . An American doctor orders a Korean medical staff to " disect out " the virus from Gang-Du's brain when it seems that they can not find any location of a virus present in anyone near the monster's initial opening attack . If Gang-Du will ever survive , he'll have to flee again . . and the idea that his daughter is still out there has not left his thoughts despite being cut into once . Now THIS is a monster movie . . a scary creation that director Joon-ho Bong is not afraid to unleash on viewers countlessly . There are some great sequences where it chases various people while the city of Seoul is thrown in a state of turmoil . This flick is very reminiscent of " Gojira " and being based on an actual event regarding the dumping of dangerous chemicals into the Han River only heightens the drama . Also , a great film about the power and dynamic of family and what lengths they'll go to rescue one of their own .
436501	9938570	71970	9.0	The Parallax View	After a Senator is assassinated ( he was a popular candidate on the hinges of running for the presidency of the USA ) , those people surrounding him high on Seattle's Space Needle are being killed one by one . While the Warren Commission proclaims the hit as a work of a lone assassin ( who falls to his death when being chased ) , we see that Bill McKinney is hidden out of place with a smirk ( and gun he is putting away ) and leaving posthaste . It seems like the one who falls to his death was a decoy for McKinney . To keep those silent who were at the scene of the crime , phony " accidental " deaths are staged . Warren Beatty , a renegade reporter , is visited by Paula Prentiss ( a former lover ) who claims that her life is in danger and that he must search for the ones responsible for the Senator's death . He doesn't take her seriously until visiting Prentiss ' dead body in the morgue . Beatty will have to uncover the identity of the assassin and the truth behind who is pulling the strings over the numerous killings taking place . The question is will Beatty stay alive long enough to find out the truth ? What unfolds as Beatty persues the truth is truly terrifying . It all leads to a mysterious corporation called Parallax who hires assassins through a unique questionaire ( the corporate title is " Division of Human Engineering " which shows it's possible recruits a montage of clips to see how they respond to the images on the screen ) . Absorbing , tense political thriller makes all the right moves at a good pace . Well acted , not to mention well photographed . A real gem . If this has the atmospheric feel of " All the President's Men " , that is because most of the same technical people from this film ( director and designer ) were behind the creation of that masterpiece .
436603	9938570	779496	9.0	Pelts	A fur-company owner , Jake ( Meat Loaf ) is an abusively nasty bastard to his employees and lusts after a stripper , Shanna ( Ellen Evusie ) unattainable to him because of not being a strong fixture in the market place . Father and son fur-trappers , Jeb & Larry ( John Saxon & Mical Suchánek ) find these remarkably beautiful pelts from these mysterious raccoons who were caught around the remnants of a past civilization nearby a creepy old lady's home . These pelts have the strange hypnotic power to make those who come in contact with them commit grisly acts to themselves and others . Despite the ghoulish violence that Jake finds awaiting him when he goes to meet Jeb and Larry , his allure and desire to possess and manufacture the pelts is too much to resist . When members of his staff start enacting violence to themselves , Jake still won't give in because the idea of finally gaining wealth , success , and Shanna overwhelm everything else . It will all come to a head when the coat for Shanna to model is completed and brought to her by Jake as they finalize their proposal together . Gruesome , nasty Argento effort packs a punch for a Masters of Horror episode . Original story , even if it's a bit off-the-wall , gives Argento an opportunity to enter supernatural territory again while also allowing him to let it all hang out in extreme gore . One man slices into his stomach with a pair of shears , one woman uses a needle to thread her mouth , eyes & nostrils shut resulting in suffocation , one sticks his head in an animal trap after bashing another's face in with a bat , and another removes his torso skin with a blade . And , the icing on the cake . . another female unfortunately has her hand removed when it gets caught in the door of a service elevator ! This just proves that Argento hasn't lost his touch regarding shocking graphic violence . Certainly strong stomachs required .
435786	9938570	69390	9.0	All the Colors of the Dark	Unrelenting suspensor about a woman so tormented by her nightmares ( after losing a child stillborn when her boyfriend Richard hit a tree ) , she's willing to try anything including black mass ritual performed by a Satanic cult introduced to her by a neighbor , Mary . Her sister , Barbara has tried to get her psychiatric help from Dr . Gordon , but Richard sees this as a silly waste of time . Jane's trauma is so disorienting , she believes a psychopath has emerged from her nightmares and manifested himself into reality . Shades of " Rosemary's Baby " is obviously present throughout the film particularly the photography of the black mass rituals , but they are none the less chilling to watch . I think what worked so well for me was the idea of this poor , frightened woman not be able to separate herself from this demented stalker with blue , piercing eyes . The film's location plays greatly into the style of the piece , but Martino's surreal lens really creates this foreboding that gets under the skin as characters { the Satanic High Priest , especially } literally grab toward the viewer . The camera loves to slide up and down Fenech's wonderfully silky body { one of the best scenes in the film is a steamy shower shot up her body as she wets herself with only a shirt on } , but it's her performance as the paranoid , nearly crazed Jane that really sells this film . Hilton is good enough given very limited screen time .
435709	9938570	101276	10.0	Afraid of the Dark	A young boy , Lucas ( stunning , haunting performance from young Ben Keyworth ) who is slowly going blind , dreams up a horrifying nightmare about a serial slasher of blind women nearby his London home ( . . with a graveyard located outside his window , no less ) . It seems to take shape when he places his thick-lensed glasses on which might mean that the impending surgery of his eyes has created such a subconscious fear it has taken shape in reality . A poor dog , Toby , becomes a victims of this . Those in reality , Tom Miller , a locksmith ( David Thewlis ) , a window washer , and photographer Tony ( Paul McGann ) all seem to become foreboding possible killers in the horrifying fantasy . Lucas ' step-dad Frank ( James Fox ) , in reality a florist , is a cop on the case of the slashings of the blind women in his nightmare . Mother Miriam ( Fanny Ardant ) is pregnant in reality with perfect sight ( . . who says she would rather be the one going blind rather than her son ) but blind in the nightmare which has the young lass worried for her safety . . and later the child after it's born , although the film paints the possible picture he'd rather harm the infant than keep it safe . Rose ( the beautiful , fine-figured Clare Holman ) is Frank's daughter in reality on the verge of marriage with Tony , but in the nightmare also blind , married to someone else blind , who is possibly threatened by Tony , anything but the person in real-life . In the nightmare we follow the boy as he canvases the area around where the serial slasher might frequent , but watch his unusual , cold manner about things . . he's an observer who seems almost unphased at the terror occurring around him . His voyeuristic activities has him seeing people from a different perspective because . . and this is the powerful aspect in the nightmare I think . . most are blind except Frank , the policeman , an ice-cream vendor who lusts after Miriam , the locksmith , window washer & photographer . So obviously he sees what the innocents do not . . how certain people truly are . In the reality , we also see a cut-away Lucas who seems like Waldo amongst a group of people existing as if he's not there . I don't think he is for the most part . . his on-coming blindness and the pregnancy about to take place take shape over everything else . The surgery is also the main event that truly terrifies him . . the doctor who will have the knife is a scary blind hobo in Lucas ' nightmare ( one of his eyes has an albino white tint for extra ominous effect ) . I'm afraid this flick will be frustrating to many who might not attach to the lead character who can be quite creepy , and detached , for most viewers . I saw this as an interesting approach seeing him as a young boy struck with fear losing his sight , both mentally and physically . I think this film goes into some dark psychological places . . treads onto that territory of fear using blindness and impending blindness as catalysts to tell the dark tale . The slasher , the glasses and what they see when Lucas puts them on and removes them , and the knitting needle which seems to be his weapon of protection . . all seem to represent symbolic images of the blindness he fears of .
436903	9938570	21814	10.0	Dracula	I know that over the years many do not consider Tod Browning's Dracula film to be as great as reputed to be , but I just continue to love it each and every time I view it . I certainly believe this is a crash course in how to shoot Gothic horror the real way . The opening is just astounding with all the cobwebs , possums , the lady vampires and how they submit to their awakening master , and Lugosi appearing for the first time in all his splendor . His eyes , as the light glistens upon them , wreak of power and lust . . whoever faces these eyes have to submit their will to his . Few weak minds , if any , can outlast the power of Count Dracula . Such richly macabre dialogue stands etched in horror lore from , " I bid you welcome , " to " The blood is the life , Renfield " . . each line becomes so eerie when rolled off the tongue of Lugosi . Some consider Lugosi's performance hammy , but I just revel in the way he stretches his dialogue . . it becomes so quotable . Lugosi was simply born to play this creature of the night and when someone says Dracula , some might think Chris Lee , but most envision Lugosi with his vile stare that penetrates the very soul . His equal , let's just admit it , is Dwight Frye as the crazed Renfield , once quite a sane , intelligent , soft-spoken office type reverted to a blood-thirsty maniac because of Dracula . It's that fiendish , stark-raving madness that is so intensely memorable . . no one can match this performance , so why even try ? But , it's the way director Browning and cinematographer Karl Freund set up creepy darkened shot after creepy darkened shot of Dracula waiting out in the darkness commanding others to do his bidding that makes this such an endearing horror classic . Some might think Edward Van Sloan might be a bit too theatrical as Van Helsing , but I can't imagine anybody else in that scene where Dracula tries to pull his rival towards him with mind control only to find his adversary's will is too strong even for him . My favorite scenes , to be honest , occur in Transylvania before the film settles in London because the castle and way Lugosi is shot are so burned in my mind . Just the way Dracula looks inside his decrepit abode on the stairwell as he stares at Renfield with that fiendish blood-lust so apparent or where we see an armadillo climbing from a coffin with this skeletal hand peeking ever slightly out . Or , the scene where Renfield receives his ride on the horse carriage as Dracula hides enough under a black cloak to remain anonymous . . each Gothic set-up is a hypnotic entrapment for the fan in love with the moody set up of atmospheric horror . I watched this with the Philip Glass score and must say I prefer it . . something majestic occurs when we hear the eruption of strings as Dracula appears . The score , for me , takes away the " creaky " criticism that so often accompanies one's insult towards it .
436282	9938570	50894	10.0	Revenge of Frankenstein	This is the 1958 sequel to the wonderful first film , Curse of Frankenstein . It stars Cushing as the Baron , saved from certain head-chopping thanks to a badly paralyzed Karl who is promised a brand new host body with his brain being transplanted into it . Assisting Baron is Dr . Kleve , but the experiment hits a snag when the body irritates during the final stages of the procedure with the body going out of control damaging one cell in the brain . In an impromptu fight with a drunken janitor of Baron's laboratory , Karl's body is again damaged , this time his body receives paralysis like before with tragic results occurring in the aftermath . It's interesting that the culprit behind all the tragedy of the film is the man who Baron pays to sweep the floor , but he does more snooping and lounging than his own job . He motivates most of the action , first spying on Baron and Kleve when they move Karl to a certain room in the surgery building of the doctor's practice , showing Baron's " goods supply girl " Miss Conrad where they keep Karl , and even providing the poor who seek Baron's help info on where the parts the doctor uses come from . The film is well executed , I think , because this time the end results did work and it is not exactly Baron's fault for the tragedy that will eventually occur . But , Karl's failure to heal his body before leaving his bed is really the turning-point of disaster for Baron . The film takes an interesting detour from the first film showing Baron as a much more sympathetic person . . still determined to see his experiments through , but no longer mad as he was willing to do anything to continue his work . But , I think the film's statement regarding Baron's work is as long as he continues playing with the laws of man in trying to create like God in the name of science , he'll always most surely hit some sort of snag .
436938	9938570	67927	10.0	The Vanishing Point	You know I can not really answer the question that is posed to cross-country car deliverer , Kowalski ( Barry Newman ) towards the end of the film by a man he made a daring , ridiculous bet with stating he could take a car from Colorado to California in 15 hours , but there's no doubt in my mind , he knew the answer as he drives his car into certain death in the final climactic scene . You might wish to wring my neck for just tossing the climax to you in such a forward way , but I don't think most viewers will expect Kowalski to make that deadline after committing the felonies he breaks along the way . There's a look on Kowalski's face that shows peace with this smile of almost gratitude for having made his long journey . Or , at least that's the way I gaged his reaction at the end as he knew his time was up . The question is . . Why even bother trying to make an exhausting trip so far in such a short time to begin with ? I have my opinion as I'm sure others do . Perhaps , the film offers to each individual a chance to make their own mind up regarding why our hero decides he must try and achieve the impossible task he sets out for . I felt it was a way of proving to himself he could achieve something to fulfill an unsatisfied existence that has been , for the most part ( I'm speaking in regards to the flashback sequences offered us sprinkled throughout the film ) , full of tragedy and sadness . I think the film appears at the start to be just a racing-against-time chase film with cops in hot pursuit , but it takes on a greater meaning to me anyways . Cleavon Little has an interesting role as Super Soul ( an interesting name , isn't it ? ) . He's a deejay who almost becomes K's spiritual guide along the way . K represents something to different people . Some look at him as the " last American dream " , others as nutty as a fruitcake . I think he's only on this journey for himself - - this calm exterior hides loneliness I think and loss ( the young lover who dies in a surfing mishap ; seeing a young druggie almost raped by a cop-partner he had on the force ) . I think the loneliness part is briefly fulfilled by Charlotte Rampling's mysterious hitchhiker ( her scenes were cut in the American version , but I watched the European one ) towards the end . I love the film for what it shows . . the American landscape allowing a car and it's driver room to navigate and live . In the time-span available , K does just that .
436534	9938570	60668	10.0	Marat / Sade	The Persecution and Assassination of Jean-Paul Marat as Performed by the Inmates of the Asylum at Charenton Under the Direction of the Marquis de Sade . The title pretty much sums up this powerfully visualized " play " , set in 1808 , during France's supposed success rate at educating the insane . This play by de Sade which is a scathing dissection of the French Revolution using Marat as the voice for the war as the Marquis takes the role against it . Morality obviously being this is a play from Marquis de Sade is also under the microscope as those that are insane fulfill certain roles under the celebrated masochist's direction . Monsieur Coulmier ( Clifford Rose ) is the mediator watching de Sade's behavior regarding what his script can and can not say . Blasphemy in this supposed golden age of France can not be warranted so Coulmier , with the assistance of nuns and guards inside , try to keep the deranged - - and de Sade - - in check . The play itself is told through not only the characters written on page , but from the insane themselves who often intervene on their own behalf . The ending is a fine slap in the face of the so-called success the French asylums seemed to have employed as the maniacs , after finishing , attack all the normal folk inside ( two aristocratic women are audience members inside the cell - - what were they thinking ? ) as Marquis relishes the chaos with glee . The staged film is disturbing , bleak , but profound and spellbinding . The way the camera moves throughout the cell ( and several shots through the bars and on the darkened audience outside the cell ) is hypnotic and deeply luridly fascinating . The cast is so good , they really convinced me I was watching a directed play using loonies !
