533511	70535	56435	1.0	Safe at home ! But out at Home Box Office .	What a stinker ! I called this turkey out before it reached first base . Ok , it was one of those cutsey films for the whole family with a message at the end , but . . . . What about the M & M boys , you ask ? Don't , please . I've seen more animation from a corpse . A cigar store indian has more life to it . Even a diehard yankee follower would heave his guts up watching this bilge . Want a more entertaining hour and a half ? Go watch paint dry . Gad !
533182	70535	116629	1.0	How can something so big be so bad ?	What did I like about this movie . Well , it was in color . Much better than black and white . Let's see , the language used was English . Made it easier to understand than , say , Mandarin . Oh , yeah , I almost forgot . I didn't have to pay anything to see it . Financially that is ; I did have to clock off a couple hours on the dwindling meter of my life , however . I suppose it is mostly my fault tho , because I am old enough to know that , as a rule , the more a film is hyped , the more it stinks . And , ladies and gents , this rubbish pile stunk all the way out to wherever the little green men live . Hammy ? Overacted ? SILLY ! ? Yes to all ! What was Fresh Prince bringing his brand of humor laugh into a so-called serious action film for ? Know what this undeveloped mess reminds me of ? The James Bond movies with Roger Moore . I despise a movie with all the little jokes and cool asides thrown in during what is supposed to be a tense moment . Such unrealism leaves me cold , and longing for a small , quiet spell with a good book . As long as the gullible public will fork over their bucks for this pablum , showbiz types will feed it to us . Probably laugh their heads off while doing so , too .
533424	70535	91164	1.0	Whores and politicos make dull bedfellows	A bored woman decides to become a whore to break the monotony . One of her clients falls in love with her and draws her into a web of inner-city political intrigue . This ' story ' meandered about like the Colorado River . Boring dialogue , confusing story , no entertainment value . I'd rather watch golf .
533349	70535	43743	1.0	Part comedy , part suspense , all bad	Excruciatingly boring tale of a thief who steals a famous painting for another man and then double crosses him . Along the way a young woman is brought into the deal to create a forgery of the painting and she winds up falling for one of the crooks . This crushing bore went on interminably as the 2 groups went about trying to outwit each other and come into possession of the valuable piece of art . Worse than " Canvas " , another stupid ' art theft ' movie .
533519	70535	65511	1.0	Namath gets sacked again . . . . this time by the critics	Joe threw the biggest bomb of his career and unfortunately it was intercepted by the viewers . This wasn't the stupidest film I've ever seen , but close . It wasn't the poorest performed , but mighty close . It was awfully close to being the most boring experience of my movie career ; even Ann M . couldn't help in that area . Smooth Joe just didn't come off as an Hell's Angel type , he's just to nice looking . And that sandwich building crap at the beginning . . . what amateurism . Get half drunk with some buddies and maybe this stumpwater will be palatable . Maybe .
532806	70535	91828	1.0	a raw deal for anyone who watches this turkey	How this gets filmed is beyond me . It has every cliche in the book , several times over . Not even a good action movie , although there was plenty of it to go around . Lousy filming , lousy acting , lousy plot , lousy action scenes . It will go down in my book as one of the most boring , stupid movies I have ever seen . Arnold took the money and ran on this one . , 000 , 000 of a star . Thumbs down and dirty . What a bomb ! !
533286	70535	62711	1.0	My hat is off to anyone who can sit through this space junk	This turkey bombed right after the opening credits closed . I couldn't sit through more than 15 minutes of this insubstantial celluloid silliness . Boring , and I mean deadly dull , dialogue , though spoken in English [ for the most part ] , made no real sense at all . Yes , Jane looked great but how long can one be expected to stare at her before that glossy figure becomes commonplace ? Before I exited all I saw the woman do was repeatedly take tumbles and do glamorous close-ups for the camera . Don't bother is my advice .
533406	70535	76666	1.0	Vinnie Barbarino dances the night away	This turkey was undercooked and served up wet . A mouthy , stupid punk in New York City gets the hots for some equally empty headed girl and spends the entire film chasing her . They kiss , they argue , she pushes him away , they wind up dancing . What a loser , really bad , movie . I must say I liked the music , but the story was lame .
533230	70535	82533	1.0	Should have called this " The Hurling " . . . .	. . . . because that is what I felt like doing after watching this drivel . This rot was like all other wolfman films - redundant , boundlessly boring , hackneyed , poorly performed , even more poorly scripted , and finally , just plain silly . Why this garbage gets such high ratings is beyond my range of understanding , but to each his own . This junk was no better than the old Lon Chaney werewolf films from the 40's , and they were pathetic beyond belief . This vomitous bilge should be avoided at all costs . Thumbs way , way down .
532816	70535	42256	1.0	Slower than molasses in mid-winter Michigan	Dreary , dull , endless dialogue between a disgruntled limey and various other characters . Power didn't fit the part of a young man at all , looking far older than his years . This film kept promising action but just never delivered . Nice props and lots of activity , but a deadly bore .
533130	70535	90756	1.0	vulgar , meaningless sexual violence	What was the purpose of this film ? I found nothing in it that I could even remotely relate to . It was just a jumble of deviant sex scenes , boring dialogue , & meaningless scenes involving foolish acting people . An utter piece of garbage .
532704	70535	62430	3.0	I could barely sit through this nonsense	In the words of Art Bell just after the Kreskin Vegas fiasco . . . lame , lame , lame . The action jumped around like a rabbit on crank , not spending nearly enough time with many of the scenes for a complete telling of the story . The dialogue was tepid and all those rambling songs were just dull , empty filler . The producers managed to take one of the best novels of the 60's and butcher it without mercy . It was fun seeing some of the old players however this film was anything but a keeper .
533399	70535	115956	4.0	Join the Army . You might win a medal .	Mediocre war flic which nevertheless showed the insanity of war , the reality check of the war machine's cannon fodder when faced with a real world combat situation , and the political goings-on designed to color the opinions of the civilian population . Not as sugary as the badly done " G . I . Jane " [ I'll bet this one upped the population in military barracks ] , but no award winner either .
532460	70535	65032	5.0	Too slow paced for what could have been an exciting movie	Too much talking , not enough action . A bad injun stalks a family in the mountains . They spent all the film never seeing the indian , but constantly being harried by him . I felt there could have been more drama to this one . It wasn't a bad picture , just slow and mopey .
532652	70535	61189	5.0	' B ' movie about thugs on cycles	I first saw this show in ' 66 when I was a cycle rider myself . I liked it so much that I went to see it twice . Even liked the music . After watching it again over 30 years later , I have to ask myself just what it was that I found so appealing about the film . It was corny , overacted , sometimes badly acted , and it had a juvenile storyline . I guess what I liked about it back then was all the motorcycles . Good to see that Peter Fonda has improved with age .
533244	70535	89886	5.0	Animal House revisited	Absolutely nothing new with this offering . Reminded me a lot of one of the worst films I ever saw , Animal House . Surely real geeks don't act this silly , eh ? The popcorn bit was pretty neat , but this format has been done before . First movie I've seen yet with Kilmer that I didn't enjoy , he is a good player but I simply hated his character in this one .
533554	70535	120737	5.0	Good takes on evil as swords flash and sorcery abounds	Much better than I thought it would be , but lacked the detail of the books . I was especially impressed with the camera as it allowed the size of some things to shrink while others expanded making a spectacular scene wherever it took the viewer . The first hour or so was a tad slow but at the end I wasn't ready for it to come to a close .
533213	70535	116329	5.0	Almost didn't finish watching	This was another of those troubled teen films that I dislike so much . The rebellious , bitchy , bratty teen with the weight of the world solidly placed on her brave little shoulders . What rot ! A very hokey production with an unbelievable story about a flock of geese trained to follow a flying go-cart . I've seen worse , but just barely .
532607	70535	91458	5.0	Im'a gonna rub'a dis punk'a out'a	This film proves it : mobsters make lousy family men . A sluggish look at a tyrannical mafia leader and the deadly effect his " business " has on his dysfunctional family . Like all these ' life story ' pictures the story is way too sketchy and rushes along barely skimming the surface of these folks tragic lives . Good acting but still a tepid Godfather wannabe minus all the flaming tommyguns , and overloaded with hysterical , unhappy screaming . The book was much more detailed and interesting .
532548	70535	32145	5.0	Good love done gone bad	Love bloomed between Heathcliff and Cathy until Cathy grew up and came to realize money , class , and station in life meant more than a pure , undying love from the heart . I couldn't agree more , but the lady wound up finding out that there was more to Heathcliff than a downtrodden , unwashed stable hand . Dreadfully slow with large , unexplained gaps in the story , but it did have nice costumes and settings . I liked the ' 70 version better ; it had a grayer , moodier atmosphere .
533514	70535	91750	5.0	Bland murder mystery	Mason takes on another seemingly hopeless case when a man murders a talk show host on television in front of 40 million viewers . The blanks he thought he was firing [ the recoil from the . 357 magnum should have told him the round was live ] had been replaced by a nefarious felon intent on making him the patsy . As usual , Perry puts his brilliant deductive powers into play and solves another sticky crime . I like the films with William Moses playing Mason's detective more than the ones with Katt . Moses is a more believable performer .
533042	70535	107090	5.0	Can't trust the cops or the media	Not bad but another re-run of bad cop / harried citizen . Things were simply too pat for me even though it was fairly well done . I did appreciate the surprise at the end , but not so much the ending itself . I still find Matlin's voice totally irritating .
533111	70535	212720	5.0	E . T . with different initials	Fairly interesting yarn with lots of nifty graphics , sights , and sounds . This is not the type of film I usually go for , but the story was solid , the performances strong , and the finale well done . I liked the way the producers turned a tale of ' machinery ' into a love story .
532504	70535	57129	5.0	Good spook scenes , but the film was too slow	I enjoyed this production , the old house was impressive and creepy . The scenes with the hammering sounds and the moanings and whispering was very effective . I felt that overall the picture could have been more lively ; the dialogue was way too slow in parts . Worth seeing though .
532750	70535	260866	5.0	One word is about all this deserves	A decent enough shoot-em-up but it has been done already . The acting was fine , the dialogue was okay , I even enjoyed the movie ; obviously it was not a low budget throwaway . However , I knew from the opening sequence pretty much what was going to happen and how it would turn out . Rainy day fare only .
532776	70535	120211	5.0	Tramp teases Texan ; manipulates mutt for money ; learns lasting lessons on love	Passable film concerning a cynical woman who dreams of true love while fleecing hand picked lovers . Mistaken identity leads her on a path of discovery , learning there's more to life than money and things . Real fiction , not real life .
533106	70535	40185	5.0	No more war ! Yeah , right .	Well , here was another statement against war and man's inhumanity to man . What's the point anyway ? It may make a fairly decent picture like this one , but man , being what he is , will always have another war . This movie was a little plodding for me , but it did give a good depiction of human nature , both good and bad .
533556	70535	104187	5.0	Run of the mill comedy	Same old stuff here as 2 30 year old high school lads unearth a quick frozen apeman and turn him into hot property around school . He presents a bad boy image so the girls go for him . Being an amazingly quick study , especially for a Neanderthal , he learns how to be a 90's kinda guy real fast [ I suppose this is done to hurry the film along so all the teens won't get bored ] . Not horrid , but merely the same old , same old .
533292	70535	100029	5.0	Run of the mill tough guy slush	Penniless foreigner comes to America and becomes a prize fighter in the underground arena where the rules are no rules . He is pursued surreptitiously by the French foreign legion bent on returning him to his post following his desertion . Bad acting , piss poor script , lousy fight scenes : not worth the time spent . This was a poor man's " Rocky " , and he came cheap . The only bright spot in the entire film was the fast talkin ' , jivin ' Joshua . Does Lionheart prevail ? Whatta you think ?
533512	70535	48312	5.0	This actually happened ?	Can't believe this tale is based on fact . No way would this mouthy , ignorant , Gomer Pyle clone be accepted in West Point . Very unrealistic was his meteoric rise in rank for the first 3 or 4 years , then to gain a new stripe every 20 years . The writer seemed to have a problem keeping his dates in order to , the same men seemed to be going to school far longer than necessary . And many of these men looked far too old to be cadets in West Point . The one scene that would give the viewer a look at how war hurts on the homefront too was offset by a couple of " pro-military , glory and the flag " speeches by the crusty but lovable sarge . What rot . I suppose the true story of Marty was considerably different ; Hollywood simply turned it into this mess . It did have a few good moments , but for the most part it was just a corny piece of fluff that was just plain silly and poorly performed .
533387	70535	73113	5.0	You vant us to die for der faderland ? Ya Wold ! You vant us to burn ? Nein vay , Jose !	Dull story about how the Hindenburg could have gone down due to a bomb . A shame somebody didn't bomb this film before it hit the screen . This could have been really good , but just never did fly for me . The entire film looked as though it was filmed inside a giant hangar . . . . and probably was . The acting was fine , but the script was plain phony for my money , however , the last 15 minutes were very exciting and horrifying .
532963	70535	43983	6.0	Fred joyously dances his way across jolly old England	You think Churchhill's daughter got her start in the biz without popsy's influence ? This was not one of Astaire's better films , but nevertheless was fun to watch . I loved the dancing of Jane Powell , but found her voice on the shrill side . Nice outdoor areas used in the filming added much to the picture . As usual , Peter Lawford was a big waste . . . how'd this guy ever get into movies ?
532365	70535	59166	6.0	I would say Jerry is 2 faced here , but . . . .	Jerry had to reach deep into his bag of stupid jokes , gags , and ham handed comedy to come up with this little jewel [ ? ] . It doesn't play well by today's standards , in fact the whole thing is double lame ; especially the 2 bits using son Gary and his band . Did the Playboys need this gig to further their hinky dinky careers ? I did get a few laughs , but the film was really just too goofy . . . . as usual for Lewis . What was with Jerry's hair ? Two or three inches long in the front , and a buzz cut in back : a reverse of today's style .
532788	70535	85970	6.0	A few laughs , but not many	Parts of this reminded me of " Freaky Friday " ; the runaway washing machine and the various workers buzzing around confusing ' mom ' to no end . Not a bad show , but I felt as though I had been through it all before . Had I dropped into the middle of this film without seeing the opening credits there is no way I would have recognized Michael Keaton : I only knew him from his later work .
533447	70535	126802	6.0	Anybody want a brand new baby ?	Didn't care for this one , way too slow and the subject was uninteresting . Why do folks want to adopt , especially from a pack of mobile home misfits ? One look at these losers and I would have been hanging an exit . This trash couldn't afford a whiff of fresh air but they always had their beer and ciggies . Not a bad production , I just found all the people involved very irritating .
532580	70535	43276	6.0	Determined U . S . Marshal takes rustler to justice	Man accused of murder and rustling is taken on a perilous journey of several days duration . While on the trip to jail , the lawmen were plagued by a lynch mob , the rustler's willful daughter , and the dry , harsh terrain . After finally getting the man to trial , a final surprise awaited the marshal .
532698	70535	119310	6.0	Honey , I think this film shrunk my brain	I guess I didn't just hate this show , but it didn't grab me real good either . It wasn't as good as the original , but much better than " Honey , I Blew Up the Kid " , which was pretty dull . The race car scene and the bubble episode were fun , but I suppose I feel this horse has been run into the ground .
533263	70535	44419	6.0	Not bad for an oldie	A group of fur traders travel into injun country for the first time must overcome steep odds when tangling with the local tribe , a powerful river , and a large fur outfit peopled with evil cutthroats . Pretty good western , a tad hammy for my tastes , with lots of action and nice scenery and fine performances by all .
532835	70535	42464	6.0	Robin Hood wannabe takes on Sheriff of Nottingham clone	This was a blatant take off on the Robin Hood tale , complete with a Frier Tuck imitation , a Little John copy , another Maid Merrian , Alan-a-Dale , etc . The picture had nice props and some good acrobatics from Lancaster and his band of merry men , but the idea that a group of men armed only with sticks and rocks can take on city hall wears a bit thin . An all-right movie , but I consider it an action / adventure tale geared more towards children than adults . The action scenes were were not well choreographed , and the story was corny .
533432	70535	256380	7.0	All fat , ugly people should watch this film	First off I'd like to say this was a bloated yet deep movie . Hal was on the right track with his attitude toward gorgeous women . Why go out with someone who can't control their urges and gorges like King Kong after 2 weeks on a grapefruit juice diet ? It isn't an ugly person's fault that they are unattractive , but who wants to wake up every morning to Apewoman . Robbins should have left well enough alone and let nature take it's course .
533351	70535	138704	7.0	Math makes the world go ' round	A math whiz , with mental and physical problems , is driven to distraction by 2 groups intent on using his genius for their own ends . Very good , not to mention unique , picture shot in black and white using non-standard filming techniques .
532754	70535	120484	7.0	Predictable yet enjoyable	Sandler does have other acts besides the no brain screw up , right ? Guess I've just missed them along the way . This was exactly what I expected , however , I still got some laughs as this moron stumbled his way to victory and a wonderful love life . Nothing new here but still good for a rainy afternoon .
533282	70535	212338	7.0	I wouldn't spend 5 minutes with this creepy crew	Most excellent , offbeat comedy . DeNiro played Jack Byrnes , a controlling father making life miserable for his daughter's new boyfriend Greg Focker , played perfectly by Ben Stiller . He applied so much pressure to the young man that he wound up being unable to do anything to please Mr . Byrnes . In fact , Byrnes caused many of Focker's mistakes with his belligerent attitude . One of the best comedies I've seen .
533421	70535	61401	7.0	Big time diamond smugglers get on Jerry's case	Smugglers have a falling out , and one of them high-tails it with the loot . When the gang finds out that Jerry unknowingly received the stones , they pull out all stops to get at him . That should have been easy , but the fools are more inept than Jerry . Of course , along the way Jerry falls in love . An amusing film .
532440	70535	113089	7.0	Rin Tin Tin , Bullet , Lassie and Boomer have nothing on The Fluke	Sometimes sad , more often funny look at a dog viewing us humans from a peculiar perspective . Nice little show with a good message about family , quality time , and not taking things for granted . Plus , the animal actors were some of the best I've seen . Cool show . P . S . If I ever get reincarnated , I hope it's as Sandra Bullock's # 1 man . Or Faith Hill . Or Jane Seymour . Or . . . .
533565	70535	66402	7.0	Solid drama based on factual evidence	I don't usually go for comedies , but this was so wacky and zany that I was busting out laughing . Slapstick all the way with a few jabs made at history and the Dumas books . Probably not for everyone , but I was in stitches . Wilder stole the show , but Welles broke me up when he took the dive .
533388	70535	120744	7.0	Intrigue , romance , and treachery in old France	What a great dungeon . I'd like to make my home there when I wasn't snugly ensconced in the royal palace with it's secret passages and hidden chambers . This film rivaled the one made in the 70's , but I don't think it was done any better . . . . if memory serves . Great props and costumes made me feel as though I was really right there in 17th century Paris . Superb acting and a well written script made the flavor of this adventure even tastier . I was all for this one .
533441	70535	59094	7.0	Bright boy beams at beautiful , buxom , bombshell Brigitte Bardot	Fairly good comedy featuring an ultra smart little boy who is used by swindlers for their own gain despite the over protectiveness of his father . Meanwhile , the boy is scheming to meet the famous French actress while his sister is anguishing over boys and proms . Typical 60's comedy .
532451	70535	72251	7.0	Exciting , suspenseful , dramatic	I seem to get a bigger kick out of Walter M . in his more serious roles , and this was no exception . A very good film with lots of action , thrills , and drama . Robert Shaw turns in his usual villainous performance as the ruthless Blue . Although this could be termed just another action film , as it is , it still brings home the bacon as a nerve jittering tale . Thumbs up .
532537	70535	120611	7.0	A different look at vampires	I admit I go more for the traditional vampire tale , but this one is a real winner . Lots of way out graphics and good story to go with them made for an interesting 2 hours . There was loads of gore with vicious blood suckers attacking mortals and even each other for control of the world . A good one for all us vampire lovers .
533553	70535	100935	7.0	Wild and hard	Crazy ride through the seedy underbelly of trashy America as two sleazy dirtbags go on the lam from an even seedier and more sleazy mama . Loved Defoe's character , he was walking evil . The dude really lost his head during the bank robbery . Fascinating film , well written and played .
532724	70535	120632	7.0	do angels really exist , and if so do they fall in love ?	This was one of the strangest films I have ever seen . It started off slow , almost boring , but finally became more interesting . It centered around an angel and his desire to become mortal after he becomes involved with a lady surgeon . It was a good story , though eerie , with excellent photography and performances .
532918	70535	67756	7.0	Treehugger is one twig short of a limb	Earth has no more greenery so a idealistic outer space landscaper becomes convinced he can keep the various species alive under a space bubble . His insanity proves more than he can handle and in a deranged state he commits a terrible crime which his conscience refuses to allow him to live with . One of Dern's better films .
532651	70535	60748	7.0	man goes after the killers of his parents	When his parents are killed for the money they don't even have , a man wants to track down the killers one by one . Great acting , nice scenery , and lots of action . I related to the vengeance theme of the film ; I would have wanted to waste the thugs too . Good production .
532416	70535	93795	7.0	Father and son just can't get along	Good portrayal of the generation gap as a father and son become alienated over patriotism and duty . When the son returns home after several years , the animosity is still there and they begin quarreling all over again . Plus , many of the town's residents are against the son because they feel he is a traitor . Violence breaks out as emotions flare and the father and son must learn to accept each other before they become irreparably separated .
533373	70535	64606	7.0	Barney gets sexy	Typical Knotts wide eyed , who me ? , what's going on here ? , comedy . Fairly amusing throughout with no serious stone left unturned in this ridiculous farce which creates a sex symbol out of a straight arrow , dull , bird watcher . This wouldn't have been as funny using a actor less goofy looking than Knotts .
532896	70535	83111	7.0	Stupidity knows no bounds	If the real National Guard is as inept as these dumbasses then no enemy need worry about mounting an attack at any time . I spent almost the entire couple of hours rooting for the cajuns to put these morons out of their ignorant misery . Not a bad film , but not a real winner either : there were simply to many holes for comfort . For instance , Coach went psycho way to quick , the cajuns couldn't possibly predict the route the soldiers would take in order to set traps and deposit the bodies of their buddies , and the cajuns wouldn't suddenly become lousy shots once they had the final two guardsmen trapped . Finally , could a squad of men really be this dumb ? It wasn't all downhill however : the private losing his nerve and the squad leader doing the ' Rambo ' like some meatheaded jerk were all to realistic . Worth seeing , but just barely .
532611	70535	111143	7.0	Outshines Batman	When an ancient warlord comes to modern day New York City to cause trouble , Cranston steps in to try and foil his scheme . The warlord , a relative of Ghengis Kahn , plans to destroy NYC with the unwitting help of 2 local scientists . He and Cranston go at it with lots of flashing swords , crazy mongols , a drowning pool , and this little knife which has a life of it's own . Lots of action with some fine computer wizardry made for an entertaining program . Plus , I really liked the matching pair of pearl handled . 45's that Lamont packed in a double shoulder holster . Knew how to use them too . Thumbs up .
532385	70535	217355	7.0	Sexy , swaggering , saucy , silly sluts slink & sashay for psyche stunted , stupid , slobbering studs	I liked this strange , erotic look into the backstage lives of dancing doxies and their crazed , wasted lives . Although some of these girls are way past their prime they still look good in a g-string . These pathetic losers are all tied up in their own personal bondage ranging from drugs , unwanted pregnancies , aspirations of future glory or loving husbands to one solid , down home , deeply embedded case of total , unrestrained dumbass . The boys running the dance hall were most assuredly not members of the local church choir : in fact , the boss was one sweet Hitler . He kept his dancers under his thumb with a balance of cool and meanness designed to keep them filling he house and not making one of their own .
532384	70535	122143	7.0	Nice little mockumentary . . . and the viewer was the one mocked	If you are looking for a film with big names you won't find it here : many of these actors are working for the first and last time ; which may be a Godsend . I thought it was an effective and fun movie as this group of devil busters head off into the wilds of Jersey looking for this area's version of Bigfoot . If played out well right down to the realistic looking footage they were shooting , including the " interviews " with various associates and professionals . In the end the producers give the entire thing away with a rather hokey finale . The players were just unprofessional enough to come off as the real McCoy and in a way they really were since this was a first and only shot for many of them . I liked the concept of the entire picture , unique and interesting .
532705	70535	47437	7.0	Goofy girl chases after useless playboy	This was well done and Holden got plenty of exercise hopping in and out of his little roadster but I preferred the glossier ' 95 version . At first I didn't think Bogey could pull off the part of Linus but he carried it off nicely .
533442	70535	42788	7.0	Sleazy , lowlife , 2 bit scumbag hustler runs a deadly scheme	One of Widmark's best performances as the loser Harry Fabian , a man obsessed with becoming a big man in the London sports world . Fabian attempts one deal after another in a desperate try at raising money for a big deal while barely managing to stay one step ahead of a ruthless wrestling promoter . Not only did Harry's actions bring about a legion of problems for himself , but he brought endless pain and sorrow to those who dealt with and cared for him . A pathetic character , but I had a hard time holding much sympathy for him .
533347	70535	40160	7.0	May be best not to meet anybody	When a magazine editor comes into contact with a strange woman he has no idea his life and liberty will soon be jeopardized . When the woman winds up dead the man's boss starts a large scale manhunt for the killer in order to further his magazine sales . Or does he have an ulterior motive ? Lots of suspense as the editor plays a cat and mouse game with a group of deadly conspirators .
533290	70535	109997	7.0	Shadowy spook shocker set on seacoast	Fun yet run of the mill spook film set in a haunted mansion on the beautiful California coast . It has the usual creaking doors , creepy attic , unexplained happenings , and a mean ghost . Fairly good , but I done been there and had a better time when I did .
532873	70535	60397	7.0	Super small sub streaks soundlessly , saves scientist	Serious problems arise as a team of doctors and scientists go inside a valuable patient to save his life and therefore aid the free world . A tight time frame and a gutless physician adds to the tension in this dramatic life and death fantasy . The props were fun , I could even believe the inside of a body would look similar to this . The sub itself looked like a cross between a stealth bomber and a souped up jet ski . Pretty good sci-fi adventure .
532641	70535	90217	7.0	Arrogant politico dumps in his own nest	When a unfeeling mayor refuses to render aid to an injured city employee he opens a can of worms which he goes nuts trying to close . Reminded me a bit of Jack Finney's novel " The Night People " because the hero's stunts got more and more outlandish until his outings culminated in the mother of political harassments . Thumbs up .
533102	70535	44706	7.0	Cowardly town of Hadleyville was too gutless to defend itself	Excellent drama about a town too chicken to live . All these gutless wonders needed to do was have 50 men with rifles go meet the 4 thugs at the train depot and explain a little simple arithmetic . Wormy little pants were just plain too scared . Typical . This was good though , as it lead to a great shoot-out ' twixt the sheriff and the 4 hoodlums . Did anybody notice the hay bales ? I thought they loaded hay onto wagons with pitchforks way back then . But , hey , didn't Grace Kelly look fine ?
533211	70535	82846	7.0	What a drag it is getting old	I laughed all the way through this one . Fonda was hilarious as the cranky old duffer worried about his own mortality . Nice location scenes , good story , and fine performances made for a very lively , entertaining film . I did object to all the profanity , however .
533435	70535	218817	7.0	Shoulda went to work for Dell , dude	Although this was a been there / done that film I still found it to be exciting and interesting . Robbins was good as the evil genius who stood to gain billions with his new software and would stop at nothing to put it on the market . Predictable all the way , but still contained a few minor surprises and , hey , all the geektalk was cool .
532845	70535	306841	7.0	Hyperactive teens tour Rome	Really fun picture based on the life story of Britney Spears meteoric rise to pop super stardom . Lizzy could do little right in her personal relationships with her fellow students , her little brother [ who was a scream as he made Lizzy's life a living hell ] , but especially in her dealings with a charismatic , charming Roman singer she meets soon after arriving in the City of Seven Hills . Wanting more than a bus ride to all the hot spots , Lizzy takes off on her own but must constantly stay on her toes to avoid having her hyjinks being discovered by a shrewd , worldly chaperon . While all this is going on Lizzy has far deeper problems from a source she trusts completely and is headed for a fall which will have a negative effect on another innocent person . Way cool movie - Lizzy rules !
532615	70535	60086	7.0	Stud cavorts with the ladies	Sex fiend tries to bed every woman he meets in jolly old England . This leads to many problems for the old chap , but he continues his ways leading to even more troubles . A classic example of the little head doing the thinking for the big head . Entertaining and interesting picture ; I particularly liked the way Alfie would address the camera as though talking to me personally .
532663	70535	51393	7.0	Gold , greed and revenge	An ex-con and a fellow inmate seek revenge and a high dollar payday in developing a plot to strip a supposedly mined out vein and selling the contents to a shady tycoon . Is revenge stronger than a lust for more financial gain by a double crossing man and his shady lawman friend ? Good western with lots of fisticuffs , gunplay , and a tense , explosive finale .
533137	70535	105698	7.0	dead soldiers go at each other	I usually avoid Van Damme's movies . He is a turkey actor who makes really bad choppy socky films . But this one was pretty good , not great , but watchable . The government brings back to life a group of dead Viet Nam soldiers and turns them into bionic warriors . The plot thickens when 2 of the soldiers don't get along because of problems they had when alive . Good action and fight scenes keep the film moving right along at a good , if predictable , clip . Worth seeing .
533233	70535	117038	7.0	Angel comes to earth to help out	Warm hearted flic depicting arch-angel Michael as a brawling , overweight , cigarette smoking slob who loves to dance and cavort with the opposite sex . He does have a good side , however , as he strives to set things right in the lives of a couple of burnt out losers before being recalled to heaven . Funny , well played out film ; very enjoyable although somewhat irreverent .
533168	70535	95119	7.0	a man has his day and then must pay the piper	Spanning 25 years , this film chronicles the life of 4 students at a Louisiana university . One , a football hero , must come to grips with his life after the glory years are over . His wife becomes unhappy with the way her marriage is going as her husband ignores her more and more . Tragedy follows one of the other students , while the last is the most successful of the four . Good performances were given by all , however , I felt the story could have been presented better in some places .
533431	70535	235737	7.0	Bad cops and good man exchange lead with each other and local ruffians	Strange , darkly moody tale of revenge , murder , drugs , insanity , freaks , losers . . . . and one all around good dude . I like films that come at me from left field which is why I liked this one ; not to mention one of my fave actors being in it [ Val ] . It's one the viewer has to just keep watching to finally figure out . Oh , and there was plenty of gunplay for all you full auto freaks .
532456	70535	68773	7.0	Boy becomes a man the hard way	Good tale of the old west in which a young boy becomes a man after his family is wiped out . Old story line , yes , but it still made for a fine film . B . J . Thomas was effective as the expert gun handler who was unable to fire at another human , even in his own defense . One of Robby Benson's best performances .
533295	70535	42369	7.0	Businessman is innocently involved in a murder plot	Good mystery about an accountant who had the wrong guy for a client . A sinister killer needs to see him dead in order to tie up any unforseen loose ends that may louse up his scheme . Very well done with a realistic sense of how something like this would go down . Neville Brand made a perfect evil creep as Chester the psycho , a part he always plays to perfection .
532856	70535	81696	7.0	Vinnie Barbarino does the Texas 2 Step	I bellied up to the bar expecting this to be a hot beer on a sweltering Texas day but was pleasantly surprised . After suffering through " Saturday Night Foolishness " I had no desire to see a re-make in some south Texas barnyard . . . . and I didn't . John Revolta was good as the jealous redneck , Scott Glenn was well cast as a thuggie ex-con , and Debra Winger was , as always , a delight . Love that woman Plus , the soundtrack was dynamite [ and this comes from a guy that can't stand the sound of country music ] . A fun film all the way .
533075	70535	116695	8.0	a sports agent loses his job and must make a comeback	Sports agent Jerry Mcguire loses his job because of his radical new ideas . He tries to get his old contacts to go with him as he leaves his company , but they prefer to stay with his old organization . He nearly goes insane trying to be fair and at the same time lure a promising athlete into his fold . This movie was funny and had a good message to it also . Look for Eagles guitarist Glen Fry in his role as the coach .
532408	70535	77928	8.0	life in a Turkish prison	A young man goes to Turkey with a plan to bring home a few squares of hash . This plan fails as he is apprehended at the airport . Sentenced to life in prison , he must endure the hell of a filthy , dangerous existence . This was a terrifying , graphic look at confinement in a foreign jail .
532935	70535	120749	8.0	Another Willis butt kicking session	Bruce lets go in this action film done in the proud diehard tradition , though not as stupid as the last one . The bodies piled up as the combatants blasted their way across town with high capacity handguns and automatic rifles . Predictable Bruce Willis plot and outcome , but still tense and exciting .
532975	70535	93693	8.0	woman with amnesia takes up with a sleazy boat operator	This was a funny film about a snooty upper class lady who loses her memory . She falls in with a low-life charter boat operator , becoming very fond of him . Of course , her memory returns , and her parents are horrified that she would cavort with someone so far beneath her station . Many laughs in this one .
532768	70535	184858	8.0	Slick , fast paced crime thriller	Sinise stole the show as the crazy trucker Monster . One more thrill ride all the way with a nice twist two thirds of the way through and a razzle dazzle gasper of an ending where the " real " twist in inserted . Edge of the seat all the way .
532993	70535	113277	8.0	I just love all that full auto stuff !	Now here was a real man's cops and robbers show . These bank bandits were in dead earnest and made believers out of a whole passel of police officers to prove it . I mean they were cranking out the rounds , mag after mag . One phony part , and it didn't really bother me : it takes only 2 heartbeats to empty an M16 magazine ; these boys went way too long between reloads . There was a lot more to this film than shoot-outs and blood , of which there were bushels and buckets . The viewer was also treated to the private side of the good guys and the bad . 5 stars .
532476	70535	95917	8.0	Sometimes religion is a killer	All I know of the Parkers is what I saw in this film so I have no idea what the ' real ' story is . If these folks are anything like the characters portrayed here then they are a pair of real donutheads . What were these 2 dunces thinking ? That God is some kind of celestial insurance agent who remedies every hurt and care of anybody the moment they ask ? Hello ? If this were true no believing Christian would ever have one single woe . I don't go for them being thrown in jail because of the misery this would cause the other children , but they deserved to beaten over the head for being so clueless . Watch church TV and see that the world is full of pathetic losers just like these two . It's scary .
533586	70535	107808	8.0	Convict and boy drive across the Lone Star State in 3 different cars	What a great film . Unusual to see Eastwood taking a back seat in a movie : Costner took the lead and did a good job with it . In fact , all the players were good , maybe because they had such a fine production with which to work . I can see why Costner's character wound up in the pen ; he made no effort to travel incognito - pretty stupid for such a high I . Q . Speaking of opacity , how did that igmo pulling the airstream get to be a Texas Ranger ? Are the police actually that brainless ?
533541	70535	100133	8.0	U . S . bombers take on the enemy	Intensely dramatic film which looks at a squadron of U . S . bombers flying missions over Germany . One plane , the Memphis Belle , is on the verge of completing the required amount of missions in order to be sent to a non-combat area . Nerves are taut as the crew learns their last mission will be an unusually dangerous one . This film had one of the most horrifying scenes I've ever seen as a stricken plane was plummeting to the earth with the screams of the crew coming over the radio of the other planes . Excellent movie .
533348	70535	99939	8.0	Guns , guts , but no God	A most enjoyable trip through the psycho wasteland of big drug operators and the cops who try to bust them . Walken was great as the totally crazed king-pin and I loved Fishburne's Jimmy Jump ; what a murderous sociopath . If you like plenty of spent ammo and gallons of blood splatter you'll go for this one in a big way .
532392	70535	131369	8.0	Would this work in the real world ?	I started off thinking I had made a mistake watching this film , but it wound up totally entertaining me . Ed was a real bore at first , but as he got deeper into his personal life the show became more and more interesting . What a collection of nuts his family turned out to be , especially the selfish brother . Good performances by all made this a real winner .
532534	70535	77294	8.0	Mission to Mars never gets off the ground	To keep the space program alive , the head honcho of NASA fakes a voyage to Mars . For months he keeps the public duped by a series of phony transmissions from " Mars " , using the hostage astronauts to help in this fraud . Things go awry when the pilots figure out that they will be eliminated to keep them silent , and they plot their escape to freedom . Very exciting film , with some great flying scenes and a fairly plausible story . There were too many holes in the plot to make it completely believable , however I still recommend it highly .
533420	70535	108330	8.0	A true slice of life	This was an excellent tale of what some people's lives are really like . The acting was flawless , the story rang true , and the dialogue was some of the best ever . Barkin was perfect as the man crazy , brainless mother , and De Niro captured the role of a bullying , phoney drunk completely . Men do indeed act like this every day , and women allow them to . Don't miss this one .
533427	70535	108451	8.0	A great portrait of lovers in love	A childhood illness leaves a young man with a serious health problem and a somewhat odd outlook on life . Being rather retiring , he was considered strange by his fellow employees ; causing them to shy away from him . Despite all this , he gets to know one of the girls better after he helps her out of a sticky situation . They manage to have a brief yet fulfilling relationship . Very romantic , I loved it .
532398	70535	118798	8.0	Sleazy politico changes horses in the middle of the creek	Excellent film showing the cheap side of politics in what appeared to be a factual tell-all . Big money rules over life and death , and when Bulworth decides to give the game away his political friends are no longer so nice . One of the blackest comedies I've ever seen . 4 stars .
532921	70535	68327	9.0	great musical	I loved this musical , it remains one of my all-time favorites . Liza Minelli and Joel Gray were perfect for their parts . The setting in pre-war Germany was an excellent background for all the goings-on in the Cabaret . Wonderful film .
532926	70535	91217	9.0	exciting sports drama	Very good movie about the price one has to pay for a grand achievement . The basketball coach took a group of goof-offs and losers , and showed them that there is no free ride ; if you want something , you have to sweat and work for it . The ending of this film could have been corny and anti-climactic , however , it came off as a real nail biter . I honestly didn't know who was going to come out on top all the way to the final gun . A real heart stopper , and an entertaining story with a good lesson . 5 stars .
533214	70535	104694	9.0	Nostalgic look at the 40's	I laughed my head off at this one . Hanks was very funny , didn't know he could be so hilarious . Rosie and Madonna were knee slappingly riotous with their constant give and take . Geena Davis was superb . I give this film a very high rating , it was a sweet little ride through the past . 5 stars .
533134	70535	103016	10.0	a ladies man learns to really love	A man who knows only how to use and discard women dies prematurely . He is offered acceptance into heaven only if he goes back to earth in the form of a woman and really loves someone . This was a very funny program ; Ellen Barkin was wonderful as the man in a woman's body . The ending was a real tear jerker , so have a hanky ready . 5 stars .
533489	70535	53793	10.0	Drunken peddler cons his way through life	A third rate salesman with the gift of gab joins the revival circuit during the prohibition / depression era . This was possibly Lancaster's finest effort , and the rest of the cast were also superb . One of the best movies I've ever seen .
532971	70535	101694	10.0	watch out who you marry	This is one of Goldie's finest . She played a woman who marries a man and has a perfect marriage for many years . Then one day she discovers something unusual about him . Very tense ending , I was on the edge of my seat . Watch this one alone , in a dark room , late at night .
