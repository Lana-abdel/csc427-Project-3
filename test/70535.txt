533117	70535	110620	1.0	This bloated corpse is guaranteed to nod'ja off	What was the purpose of this gibberish unless to aggravate all lovers of vampire film . Amateur hour performances , exhausted dialogue , totally ridiculous use of the camera , and then there was the big finale [ a concoction as stale as last week's salad ] . Two fangs down to this empty casket .
533182	70535	116629	1.0	How can something so big be so bad ?	What did I like about this movie . Well , it was in color . Much better than black and white . Let's see , the language used was English . Made it easier to understand than , say , Mandarin . Oh , yeah , I almost forgot . I didn't have to pay anything to see it . Financially that is ; I did have to clock off a couple hours on the dwindling meter of my life , however . I suppose it is mostly my fault tho , because I am old enough to know that , as a rule , the more a film is hyped , the more it stinks . And , ladies and gents , this rubbish pile stunk all the way out to wherever the little green men live . Hammy ? Overacted ? SILLY ! ? Yes to all ! What was Fresh Prince bringing his brand of humor laugh into a so-called serious action film for ? Know what this undeveloped mess reminds me of ? The James Bond movies with Roger Moore . I despise a movie with all the little jokes and cool asides thrown in during what is supposed to be a tense moment . Such unrealism leaves me cold , and longing for a small , quiet spell with a good book . As long as the gullible public will fork over their bucks for this pablum , showbiz types will feed it to us . Probably laugh their heads off while doing so , too .
532970	70535	93437	1.0	Count Dracula is rolling over in his casket	What was this piece of garbage , anyway ? Was it a comedy ? Drama ? Or just a vehicle for a bunch of spoiled actors to take home a big payday ? It certainly was not entertainment . Shallow ? Yes . Insipid ? Certainly . Plain silly ? To be sure . I don't like comedy vampire films to start with , and this crap just took the cake . Don't bother with this turkey , it offered nothing in the way of excitement or chills . I rate it down there with " Buffy the Vampire Sleeper " .
533283	70535	50301	1.0	More stupid Jerry	Once again Jerry stinks up the big screen with his hyperactive sthick . Here he offers the ultimate in corny jokes along with a ' hoods become angels with the right kindly influence ' story . If you really like Jerry then you'll most likely go for this one , otherwise it will bore you senseless .
533412	70535	173771	1.0	This documentary is more deceased than one of Romero's zombies	Dull analysis of George Romero's films , a gentleman who apparently went to the Roger Corman School of Film Making . A lot of words were spoken about Mr . Romero and his unusual method of shooting pictures . All this excess verbal diarrhea and the fact remains that Romero is a low budget hack who can't get a big money backer . Since he can't get this backing from the legit studios he lays claim to being a maverick who does things his own way [ read : makes 2 bit , turkey movies ] . I heard a lot of jabbering about the lackluster film that comes out of mainstream " Hollywood " and a lot of hullabaloo on how much better , more innovative and honest , are the independent film makers . Sometimes this is true , but I have seen a large amount from both camps that are suitable only for ceiling drapery at a frat house party . Running low on funds does not make a producer of film less pretentious nor more valid than a larger outfit .
533519	70535	65511	1.0	Namath gets sacked again . . . . this time by the critics	Joe threw the biggest bomb of his career and unfortunately it was intercepted by the viewers . This wasn't the stupidest film I've ever seen , but close . It wasn't the poorest performed , but mighty close . It was awfully close to being the most boring experience of my movie career ; even Ann M . couldn't help in that area . Smooth Joe just didn't come off as an Hell's Angel type , he's just to nice looking . And that sandwich building crap at the beginning . . . what amateurism . Get half drunk with some buddies and maybe this stumpwater will be palatable . Maybe .
532809	70535	98439	1.0	boring cop show	Too bad the writers in tinsel town couldn't come up with a better program than this . Should have called it " Bango and Trash " , because that is what it did and what it was . Boring action scenes , dumb plot that has been done a million times , and uninspired acting . And why not ? I couldn't get excited listening to and watching this drivel , why should I expect anything else from the actors ? Don't waste your time with this camel dung . th star .
532669	70535	116493	3.0	People want these obnoxious little brats ?	This wasn't what I thought it was going to be . Mainly it was way too juvenile , but also the actors gave unconvincing performances . Probably a decent film for kids , and it carried a good message of forgiveness in the end , but I figure I'm too long in the tooth for this style of entertainment .
533157	70535	102703	3.0	No amount of praying can save this lost turkey on skates	This was intended to be a sizzling action film but quickly metamorphoses into silly ass , mindless teen boredom . The acting was sub-pathetic , the choreography junior grade , and the story on a third grade level [ assurance that all the teens could easily keep up ] . And what is with all the anguishing over this Haim kid ? Just some punk second rate actor wannabe in dire need of a competent hairdresser . This bilge was so juvenile I wonder if a 10 year old could go for it .
532627	70535	115759	3.0	Same ol ' , same ol ' , same ol ' , same ol '	Didn't Hollywood get this putrid mess out of their systems back in the 70's when filming all those abysmal James Bond dogs ? Now they come back with a rehash of the same old crap with 2 popular actors ; who , I might add , could and have done better . This turkey never left the ground it was so weighted with a dull script and terminally stupid dialogue . Had the producers cut out all the silly one liners and unrealistic footage , the show would have lasted about 10 minutes . Travolta deserves better than this , but I guess he couldn't say no to the payday .
533399	70535	115956	4.0	Join the Army . You might win a medal .	Mediocre war flic which nevertheless showed the insanity of war , the reality check of the war machine's cannon fodder when faced with a real world combat situation , and the political goings-on designed to color the opinions of the civilian population . Not as sugary as the badly done " G . I . Jane " [ I'll bet this one upped the population in military barracks ] , but no award winner either .
532775	70535	70458	5.0	Laughable	If Dracula ever sees this garbage he will furiously drain every member of the cast and crew . Here we have a vampire who goes " AAARRRRRGGGGHHHHHH ! " as he attacks and strangles his victims , a terrified wife , the standard believer / unbeliever line , and lots of stormy weather [ what else ? ] . Hammy acting , lackluster dialogue , and a stupid story offering a series of " surprises " one can see coming 15 minutes before their arrival made for 1 hours of total tedium . I was particularly offended by Angie Dickenson's way overdone high school drama club gasps , expressions , and dubbed in screams , however I did somewhat appreciate the final couple minutes of the film .
533220	70535	61420	5.0	Pretty bad , but fun to see	This one started the Billy Jack craze . Personally , I think Billy is an idealistic moron . He thought he could fight city hall , and never did realize he couldn't . The gang leader had more upstairs than Billy did . And Mclaughlin never did learn how to act ; what a ham .
532423	70535	41890	5.0	Farm life in the early 20th century	A small boy becomes emotionally attached to a new born black lamb and decides to enter it in the county fair . Living with his stern Granny on a farm means there is little money for frivolities , so the youngster goes out and gets the needed funds the old fashioned way . . . he earned them . Many things conspire to halt the trip to the fair : most brought on by the critter itself , but , of course , the lad and his pet enter the competition . There are lots of songs and animation in this dated but still enjoyable film , which also carries a simple but solid message about dealing with life's good and bad times .
532485	70535	113028	5.0	Predictable adventure yarn	Why can't Hollywood come up with something besides the same old stuff that plays out exactly as you know it will ? Every cliche in the " boy lost in the wilderness " tale was brought out , dusted off , and run a little deeper into the turf . This kid was supposed to have had training in the survival arts , but he didn't have a clue as to the first rule when lost . . . stay put . He just kept walking farther and farther away from his rescuers while mom and pop were at home wringing their hands in agony . Of course , there was another of those idiotic wolf attacks . Enough with the wolf attacks !
532810	70535	70294	5.0	As bad as the book	Run of the mill " ghostbusters visit old house " bore . The usual spooky hijinks - banging noises , moving objects , eerie manifestations , screaming women , gasps , groans , slamming doors , blah , blah , blah . Can't take this crap seriously and unable to laugh at it either . Where is Anton Phibes when he is needed ?
533381	70535	95304	5.0	This one didn't raise my spirits much	Another in a long line of ghostly comedies which does little to frighten , and even less to amuse . Getting to eyeball Miss Hannah and the breathy Jen Tilley was a treat , but not enough of one to recommend this dismal film . I wonder if Jennifer will ever make a decent picture . . . but what a sweet , panting voice she has .
533056	70535	97500	5.0	I coulda been watching the IFC channel	Occasionally amusing but for the most part I just sat there and watched these folks go through their paces . This was merely one of those pictures created to fill up a film reel and make a nice payday for a big name actor . A pointless exercise in tedium .
532598	70535	22353	5.0	German u-boat plays cat and mouse with allied gunboat in WW1	Rarely have I seen such stilted , hammy , and just plain bad acting . There didn't appear to be a professional performer in the whole picture . And the dialogue ! Gad ! The skipper of the allied vessel came off more like a cheerleader than a leader of men . I still enjoyed the film ; even with all the cornball humor from the brainless naval crew . If their collective brains could be rendered into gasoline , there wouldn't be enough to run a termite's chainsaw . Fairly good action yarn for such an old picture .
533098	70535	60453	5.0	What was the attraction with this breeding sow ?	Oh so British comedy showing unfulfilled Georgy romping through ruddy London waxing from giddy smiles to sniveling tears when her status as a non-mommy hits her . Why 2 men went all ga-ga over this baby crazy sweat hog goes beyond me , but thrilled they were . I loved the look on Mason's face in the final frame as the realization that he'd taken on more than bargained for came crashing into his horny little brain . Good picture .
532844	70535	305224	5.0	This film could make one angry	Sandler's character , Dave Buznik , kept getting the short end of the stick in all his business and social engagements . He was simply a nice , easy going guy who only wanted to get by on the job without any ugly entanglements to complicate his life . I wonder how many ' easy going ' types are seething volcanoes inside ready to blow at the slightest provocation . And is this the problem Buznik has ? Buddy Rydell , his counselor , seems to think so as he coachs Dave continually in an effort to rid him of his problems . At first I didn't like the film ; it seemed to be silly and pointless . As it went on I grew to like it , especially Buddy , who had more on the ball than was at first apparent . Decent enough comedy with the scene at the Budda Gardens being one of the highlights . Loved that romantic ending right in the middle of Yankee Stadium .
533106	70535	40185	5.0	No more war ! Yeah , right .	Well , here was another statement against war and man's inhumanity to man . What's the point anyway ? It may make a fairly decent picture like this one , but man , being what he is , will always have another war . This movie was a little plodding for me , but it did give a good depiction of human nature , both good and bad .
532614	70535	87022	5.0	Average who-dunnit	The police investigate the murder of a couple of models who work for the same agency . The killer is bumping off the girls according to the name of the month they go by , so the cops stake out the next girl in line . There are some good suspects , but no one they can pin the deaths on until they get just the break they need . Nothing special in this one ; sort of a low budget film .
533337	70535	81375	5.0	No laughs to be had in this ' comedy '	I heard nothing but glowing comments on this film for years , but when I finally saw it there was no laughter from me . I sat straight faced all the way through waiting impatiently for the fun to start . All I saw was a poorly made movie with a silly plot and uninspired performances . Bypass this turkey .
533099	70535	67549	5.0	Why didn't they just o . d . ?	After reading the book I expected more from this film . I was merely antagonized watching the antics of these 2 pathetic losers and their grimey pals . When they let the episode with the little dog occur I began fervently hoping they would shoot up some drano by mistake and slowly turn green and decay after hours of total misery . A well done picture to be sure , but the characters were so obnoxious I could concentrate only on hating them .
533468	70535	54469	6.0	Where the man crazy piranhas are is more like it	I'll start off by saying this had some of the most dorky acting I've ever witnessed ; George Hamilton couldn't have been more stiff if he had a fully developed case of rigor mortis . And what a story : 4 man / marriage happy broads go to the beach and can't even enjoy themselves for fretting over " catching a man " . Especially Yvette Mimieux's character : I wanted to jap slap that whining moron onto the next sand dune . Long time since I saw Paula Prentiss , the first woman I ever saw " full front nude " in a movie . Unfortunately , she couldn't make up her mind in this epic whether she wanted to use the deep voice or her natural tones . I suppose I can't say this is a bad film , but I wouldn't call it a good one either . I will say the aquarium scene had me on the floor . . . . can't say why I found it so hilarious . Probably just the slapstick of it , plus Gorshin's fish face .
533199	70535	93793	6.0	corny , but lovable animal story	This was pretty corny and unbelievable . What I call a silly drama . The acting was good , but the plot was totally unrealistic . At least , I don't think a monkey can fly a plane . The government is experimenting with chimps to see how long they can fly a plane in a simulated situation after taking a lethal dose of radiation . Helen Hunt's pet monkey gets into this program , and she is driven to rescuing him before his turn comes up . With the help of an air force cadet , she breaks the chimp out of the installation , but is in for big trouble from the military big-shots . Some tense moments follow , but they are so hammy that I couldn't get to worked up over the whole deal . Cute family show with some profanity .
533480	70535	67589	6.0	Marriage doesn't work	Had the entire film been as funny as the last segment , I would have rated it higher . The first 2 were full of dull , sexy , or bitchy dialogue , but the last was a real ripper . The distraught mom and the overwrought dad had me in the floor with their idiotic antics . I don't care for Neil Simon comedies ; at least the ones I've seen .
532698	70535	119310	6.0	Honey , I think this film shrunk my brain	I guess I didn't just hate this show , but it didn't grab me real good either . It wasn't as good as the original , but much better than " Honey , I Blew Up the Kid " , which was pretty dull . The race car scene and the bubble episode were fun , but I suppose I feel this horse has been run into the ground .
532579	70535	192255	6.0	Not your usual vampire flic	A long way from the great Ann Rice and Stephen King tales of the undead . I liked seeing the vamps played as the victim , having to deal with a crazed hunter of their kind , and watching their growing friendship with a mortal who can mysteriously aid in their quest to return to their own far off world . Totally enjoyable and , unlike Trix , not just for kids .
532489	70535	85622	7.0	Once a thief . . . .	Good movie with an old timey look to it . Not a big shoot-em-up western , but filmed more like a real life story would go . Well acted with a believable feel to it , but I objected , once again , to Hollywood putting their spin on a common criminal , building him up as some kind of nice person . This " gentleman " and his gang were armed robbers who shot it out with a guard who was doing his job : this gent also pulled a gun on another man and threatened his life . He also roughed up one of his henchmen for a comment on the " gentleman's " woman friend . A kindly old man doing a service to his community ? Hardly . Just a thief who belonged behind bars .
532755	70535	132213	7.0	It's only money . . . or is it ?	Bizarrely funny comedy that keeps the viewers on their toes as a bevy of characters flit all over town chasing an illusive 900 dollar payoff , but not for exactly what each supposes . Good dialogue and hilarious situations make for a snappy , fast paced film which appears to be going much more slowly .
532752	70535	112817	7.0	Bizarre , off the wall western	Oddly filmed black and white tale of a man whose life goes haywire after a chance meeting with a saloon girl . Soon he encountered a strange indian , three fast guns , and an assortment of backcountry dirtbags most of whom were intent on making him a dead man . Henriksen was superb as the evil , cannibalistic killer . The head squashing scene was a hoot , adding a nice edge to this dark comedy .
532509	70535	87995	7.0	Hey , that's my car !	Off the wall film about men who repossess cars . Or was it ? Finally , they get to repo the car that everybody wants , but they still don't get to make a buck out of the deal . I enjoyed watching this one , but it wasn't what I expected . Very weird .
532754	70535	120484	7.0	Predictable yet enjoyable	Sandler does have other acts besides the no brain screw up , right ? Guess I've just missed them along the way . This was exactly what I expected , however , I still got some laughs as this moron stumbled his way to victory and a wonderful love life . Nothing new here but still good for a rainy afternoon .
533005	70535	90004	7.0	Fairly entertaining comedy / suspense	A sleazy tabloid reporter teams up with a college professor to investigate the strange occurrences in a small town . They get no help from the suspicious , fearful , and in some cases , eerie inhabitants of the town . They finally solve the mystery of why these occult phenomena occur , and what a surprise it is .
532512	70535	50487	7.0	Dated and somewhat corny , but still entertaining	Good drama showing how a family can be far different than what it appears when certain members refuse to live in the present . Nolan was good as the bantam rooster of a father and Franciosa shone as the drunken yet solid older brother . As always Silva , with that cruel face , was well cast as a heartless pusher whose love for money can only lead to disaster . I wanted to slap his hyper little helper ; what a creep .
533282	70535	212338	7.0	I wouldn't spend 5 minutes with this creepy crew	Most excellent , offbeat comedy . DeNiro played Jack Byrnes , a controlling father making life miserable for his daughter's new boyfriend Greg Focker , played perfectly by Ben Stiller . He applied so much pressure to the young man that he wound up being unable to do anything to please Mr . Byrnes . In fact , Byrnes caused many of Focker's mistakes with his belligerent attitude . One of the best comedies I've seen .
532720	70535	106582	7.0	just another in the action genre	Good action show , but nothing new . This one took place high in the mountains , which showed some nice scenery and such . One man takes on a group of mercenaries , the lead flies , and he kicks butt . It could have been called " Rambo Goes to the Rockies " , it was that pat . It did have one very effective scene right at the first of the film which had me cringing in horror . Not a bad picture , but just same ol ' , same ol ' .
532439	70535	89629	7.0	Very stupid but lots of giggles	I loved this silliness which didn't try to pass itself off as anything but a totally goofy spoof . I particularly enjoyed Keach's stiff backed , rule happy [ exempting himself , of course ] cop intent on breaking a group of citizens ' while taking advantage of them . If you like super silly farces having no roots in reality this is the ticket .
533415	70535	103266	7.0	Ignorance knows no bounds	A young girl is locked away in a feed outhouse way out in the country because her redneck father thinks she is off her rocker . When 2 neighbor kids befriend her she begins to come out of her shell and slowly become functional after years as a recluse . Very good picture .
532786	70535	50356	7.0	Those dirty , stinking , gutless , backstabbing Nazis ' strike again	Pretty much your typical war drama as a U . S . destroyer and a kraut sub attempt to outmaneuver each other in a cat and mouse duel on the South Atlantic seas . Lots of good depth charge sequences , and the show wasn't bad , but it was also really corny in a couple of spots : namely , the German sailor losing his grip and the U . S . crew member taking the loss of his fingers in a toothy , ho-hum manner . The use of toy boats was a bit obvious , too .
532651	70535	60748	7.0	man goes after the killers of his parents	When his parents are killed for the money they don't even have , a man wants to track down the killers one by one . Great acting , nice scenery , and lots of action . I related to the vengeance theme of the film ; I would have wanted to waste the thugs too . Good production .
532596	70535	43379	7.0	Stuffed shirt British sea cap'n fights and loves his way across the 7 seas	The good cap'n does battle with the evil Napoleon Bonaparte , while wooing the lovely Lady Wellesley . Lots of canvas fell on folks heads as the cannon roared , but Cap'n H . and his lusty lads prevailed . This was a good show with colorful costumes and some nice action sequences , but some of the dialogue was a tad hokey . For my money they could have left Lady W . on shore and had a couple more fights - too much confounded smoochin ' . 3 stars .
532374	70535	113269	7.0	Good spooky mystery	I am not usually scared by spook films and this one was no exception . However , I considered it to be a good mystery with a chilling twist . A college professor of psychology is called to a home to prove or disprove the presence of ghosts which appear to be haunting the mistress of the house . Lots of creepy things happen while the professor is there , and they all seem to center around three siblings who live in the house with their aunt . The professor , who does not believe in ghosts , comes to question those beliefs as his stay in the house progresses . Worth seeing .
532818	70535	104850	7.0	I just can't see Chevy Chase in this role	I'll start out by saying I've never seen Daryl Hannah looking better . Having that out of the way , I will say this film wasn't particularly funny nor was it anything more than an average picture , but the special effects were special indeed . Neill was fine as the C . I . A . goon intent on cashing in on someone else's misery . All things considered , I still think being invisible would be a plus . Hannah gave all the good reasons .
532912	70535	65874	7.0	Foolish fellow falls for foxy filly	Peck does a nice job playing a middle age crazy sheriff who meets and goes over the edge for a rawboned hillbilly girl . He has a decent , loving wife at home but his discontent with his life leads to his making one stupid mistake after another in not only his private life but his professional as well . Well played out film with top notch performances by the entire cast and a sound track by Johnny Cash which intertwines nicely with the picture .
533498	70535	94025	7.0	More exciting than funny	There were some laughs and this was a good show , but I found the level of tension higher than the laugh level : and Aidan Quinn plain stole the show with his psycho act . However , the entire production has been done before . I've seen the improbable love affair , the guns , the car wrecks . . . .
532420	70535	67921	7.0	Mexican gentleman takes on mob of old west gangsters	A former Apache hunter , who has lost his taste for violence , becomes embroiled in a running duel across a scorched , rugged terrain with a gang of gunrunners . . . all over a lousy 100 bucks . . . and honor . . . and a woman . This film reminded me somewhat of Charles Bronson's first big box office hit , " Chato's Land " . The band of thugs , unlike the group chasing Chato , were up to the job of killing Valdez , but found their quarry to be more elusive than they had bargained for . Very good western , right up there with Lancaster's film of the same year , " Lawman " . I still can't feature Burt as a Mexican , though .
532482	70535	117918	7.0	Basically just another tepid love story	This was a big production with lots of big names and flashy scenes , but it still failed to score with me . No problem with the performances and most of the dialogue was interesting , but I could find no sympathy for the loser golfer with the winning smile and personality who was at heart just another self made casualty of life . He just plain aggravated me with his silly , self flagellating nonsense . What a wormy moron , and he gets the girl [ which , considering the standard female attitude toward dips like him , was no surprise either ] .
533395	70535	47411	7.0	Revenge in the old southwest	Murf plays a man intent on revenging the murder of his kin . To give the appearance of helping him he is deputized by a renegade sheriff and sent off on a mission sure to cause his death at the hands of psychotic killer Whitey Kincaid . When things don't go as the lawman planned he and his henchmen must try other measures to get the pesky little rascal off their scent or be found out as the very ones Murf is seeking . Average western with Duryea giving quite a performance as the always jolly , backshooting scumbag Kincaid .
532686	70535	74776	7.0	2 hardheads try to outgun each other	Good western filmed in the rocky Arizona wilds . Lots of tough guys throughout ; Cobern's character seemed to rock back and forth between a raging psycho and a laid back type . Several holes appeared in the picture , but not enough to offset it being exciting and worth seeing . One really dumb scene shows Heston emptying . 45 cases of their powder and collecting it in a sack for the purpose of starting a fire . A . To gather that much gunpowder he would have needed a pack mule to carry the ammo . B . The grass was obviously dry : why not just drop a match on it and let ' er rip ?
533437	70535	159273	7.0	Bat 21 in a different country	Very exciting film , giving the viewer nothing new in the way of a story . I was on the edge of my seat all the way through especially during the SAM attack on the airplane . Hackman gives his standard fine performance as the Admiral willing to scrap his career for one of his men , and Wilson does a commendable job fighting and running across dangerous ground . Thumbs up .
532740	70535	115605	7.0	Classic example of why no one should EVER have kids	Here we have a well adjusted gentleman with a nice life who is informed by a former lover - read : tramp - that he is a poppa . So what does he do ? Goes off the non-shallow end and gets all sappy and parental over the little carpet crawler . Naturally , many problems arise and not all of them from the crumb grabber either , although he was bad enough . 2 a . m . wakeup calls from a high decibel voicebox ; splattered , smeared , at one time completely edible , not to mention costly , food slathered unevenly over , formerly , perfectly usable household furnishings ; dull , uninspired trips to the grocer for jar after jar of future $24 . 95 per yard carpet greasing material and other assorted ' after the house is wrecked ' clean-up articles . All this plus the money this guy blew for toys , clothes , and court costs : never mind all the bills he will assume as the brat ages . What was he thinking ? Why would any sane person take on such a monumental effort ? Think of all the playoff games missed due to mopping baby droppings off a $3000 home theater system . The poor slob reaches his all time low when he films home movies of the tiny cutie then sits around ohh-ing and ahh-ing when he could have been watching " Hot Stewardesses at 50 , 000 Feet " . This was a good film , but I was a nervous wreck before it was half over . If you are strange and actually love these noisy , expensive little pests then this is your picture : if not , you have been warned .
532351	70535	115710	7.0	Is money everything ?	Life just doesn't go well for a 2 bit thief and his family when he teams up with an ex-con to steal a fancy necklace . Lots of death and violence follow as the jewel gets away from the 2 crooks who discover in the end that there is more to life than money . Good one .
532602	70535	181655	7.0	Christmas isn't for everyone	Hard hearted businessman has neither the time nor the inclination to celebrate Christmas and this attitude hurts his son's feeling and antagonizes the wife . After thinking up a foolproof way to take over the entire toy market worldwide this corporate raider heads for the North Pole to grab the ultimate toy factory . While there he discovers that Santa , an old " acquaintance " , is having takeover problems of his own . This causes the man to make a choice between holding on to his hates and hurts or to become reacquainted with his family and learn to appreciate the holiday season . Good one .
532672	70535	60176	7.0	Very cleverly crafted mystery	This was an excellent film , that was aptly titled . The blow up of a negative which showed a murder committed was the key to the whole mystery . I watched as the characters played and replayed the murder sequence , and never caught on to the killer's use of the weapon . This movie reminded me a lot of Hitchcock's work . An added attraction was the brief clip featuring the Yardbirds on a rave-up .
532857	70535	53291	7.0	Music and the mob don't mix	Fairly good comedy which bogged down a bit midway , however it still works after all these years . As always , Lemmon is dead on and gives a hilarious portrayal of Daphne , but is he ever an ugly woman . An untalented Monroe plays her typical slut character . I loved the party scene on the train with all the half clad honeys crowding together in the one tiny berth . Worth seeing .
533260	70535	60355	7.0	Injuns and cavalry duke it out in Utah	When the Army wants to transport a load of guns and ammo to another fort , a band of bloodthirsty savages , who are not good at reservation life , attack the soldiers . The pesky redskins lead the innocent Army men into a trap and begin wiping them out . However , the wiley officer in charge developes a plan to trick the sneaky , backstabbing redmen by doubling back after appearing to be going in another direction . Unfortunately , the bluecoats still kept on losing the fight . Exciting western with a predictable ending , filmed in the stark yet beautiful state of Utah .
532701	70535	82432	7.0	Young Aussies can't wait to enter WW1	At Normandy Ike wanted untested troops for the invasion because seasoned vets knew what the price of war was . At Gallipoli the combat hungry kids learned the price very early on but it was too late to un-enlist . If only the young were smarter maybe no wars would be fought . Good show and not just about war either .
533475	70535	100263	7.0	Interesting but slow and somewhat confusing	Decent enough shoot-em-up which relies too heavily at times on ridiculous overkill to make the anti-heroine look way bad . How would one describe this killing machine anyway ? Sexy ? Yes . Evil ? Most assuredly . Sociopathic ? Don't think so . She appeared to wear her feelings on her sleeve all the way through the picture which no self respecting nutcase would ever do . Every time things began to go wrong for little Nikki she would break down in hysterics crying for mercy , her mommy , or a little peace please Mr . Policeman . This idiot could go from coldly murdering her victims to blinding rages in which she threatens to kill everybody present to sweating over a kill she is about to make . The whiney / slobbering lunatic weirdo bit was incompatible with a hired gun working for a clandestine government unit . Furthermore , large jumps in time were momentarily confusing and could have been better explained by the writers . Not a bad film , just full of holes . . . . but didn't that girl have a set of legs ?
533171	70535	115578	7.0	Evil government killers go after enemies	Re-hash of the old governmental agency gone bad . After a former agent gets on their trail and threatens to blow their cover , an organization within the FBI rubs out several folks to keep the lid on their nasty little conspiracy . Lots of action and excitement kept the pace up and I enjoyed the film , but don't go in looking for anything new with this one .
532697	70535	44921	7.0	Badmen hide behind badges	When an idealistic young man comes to Montana territory to start a new life , he becomes a deputy sheriff . He wants to clean up the area which is infested with killers and thieves , but is duped into aiding those very men . Good action yarn with lots of blazing sixguns , stagecoach chases , and thundering hooves .
532402	70535	34182	7.0	hillbilly life in the Ozarks	Good story about a backwoods community in the Ozarks around the turn of the century . Moonshine is the leading industry , fighting and funning the major form of entertainment . One day a stranger enters the community and causes a shake-up among the locals . Beautiful scenery adds much to the story .
532594	70535	49291	7.0	Sleazy promoter wheels and deals his way to big money	An out of work sports columnist takes a job building up the reputation of a boxer who has no talent . His boss , a ruthless promoter , pits the pugilist against better athletes , but has the contests rigged in favor of his own fighter . This is a tense , well acted picture which gives a graphic portrayal of the seedy side of sports .
533573	70535	119778	7.0	Boy almost doesn't meet girl	Spiffy little romance / comedy which didn't follow in the footsteps of most in this genre . Perfectly paced with nice doses of nifty dialogue , a plethora of all sorts of characters , and a pair of leading players who came off as real people with the same needs as all of us . The leading lady was torn between her need for a mate and her distaste for all the hubbub that such a search entails . The leading man didn't appear to need a mate as much as he needed to shuck his routine job in favor of the more interesting marine biologist . This , at times , paled in comparison to his money problems and having to deal with a shady character and his muscle bound crony lurking menacingly just behind . Good film , and you'll love that aquarium .
532881	70535	106266	7.0	Just where was The Kingfish ?	And Lightnin ' ? Well , Leonard may have rated this one a bomb , but I rather enjoyed the absurdity . And was it really that unreasonable ? I can see today's dishonest law enforcement trying to pull some ridiculous stunt like this to cover their own butts . View the shenanigans that went on in the White House in recent years . Cage and Jackson were great together and the picture was funny . Plus , I've seen protesters act exactly this stupid .
532663	70535	51393	7.0	Gold , greed and revenge	An ex-con and a fellow inmate seek revenge and a high dollar payday in developing a plot to strip a supposedly mined out vein and selling the contents to a shady tycoon . Is revenge stronger than a lust for more financial gain by a double crossing man and his shady lawman friend ? Good western with lots of fisticuffs , gunplay , and a tense , explosive finale .
533477	70535	47073	7.0	Old salt must save the world	Nicely done picture dealing with a group of desperate men who recruit a former sub commander hoping he can stop a deadly threat on a remote island . Again Widmark shows us he is one of the top tough guys of the silver screen as he barks and growls his way to getting the crew he wants , and later on , the results he demands . Not content to do the job as the leading physicist insists , the rogue sailor cuts through all protests and does it his way . Although there were only a couple of big firefights , the story stayed interesting except for the standard love interest which must have been put in for the lady viewers . I felt the ending was weak though amusing as the crew opened up with all the hardware available at a very unlikely target .
533137	70535	105698	7.0	dead soldiers go at each other	I usually avoid Van Damme's movies . He is a turkey actor who makes really bad choppy socky films . But this one was pretty good , not great , but watchable . The government brings back to life a group of dead Viet Nam soldiers and turns them into bionic warriors . The plot thickens when 2 of the soldiers don't get along because of problems they had when alive . Good action and fight scenes keep the film moving right along at a good , if predictable , clip . Worth seeing .
532562	70535	156812	7.0	Heartwarming heartbreaker	Anybody who had a close friend during childhood who happened to be a canine should go for this one . Like most of the pooch films it was corny in spots , but at least Skip wasn't endowed with human intelligence . Of course , the mean men were around to cause trouble for the dog and boy ; can't get by without them . Fun movie , but be sure to bring along a crying towel .
532796	70535	105691	7.0	Standard whodunnit	Fairly good story about a 2 bit scoundrel private eye who apparently becomes involved in a double homicide while running a sleazy con game . A large insurance settlement is at stake and the police must figure out if the victim's wife did the deed or if it was her rival , hubby's mistress . Or could it have been someone else . . . . . ?
532456	70535	68773	7.0	Boy becomes a man the hard way	Good tale of the old west in which a young boy becomes a man after his family is wiped out . Old story line , yes , but it still made for a fine film . B . J . Thomas was effective as the expert gun handler who was unable to fire at another human , even in his own defense . One of Robby Benson's best performances .
532723	70535	120402	8.0	2 greedy men make life uncomfortable for a beekeeper	Excellent tale about a man who gets involved with 2 men intent on getting their hands on a stash of stolen loot from an armored car robbery . Unique story with an actor I haven't seen since he hit middle age . Peter Fonda still has the same soulful eyes he had when I first saw him in " Wild Angels " back in the mid-60's . His acting has improved considerably over the years ; I thought his old underground films were somewhat amateurish back then . This was a fine movie which reminded me a little of his western " The Hired Hand " from some 20 years ago . Well worth watching .
532390	70535	118747	8.0	Funnier than the original	Had a great time watching this one . Lots of blues music and snappy dancing , the music being performed by many of the blues leading players and legends . And that car pile-up . What a riot ! I couldn't stop laughing all the way through ; loved the way Elwood parked his car . Funny , funny picture .
533113	70535	202677	8.0	Many die so scumbag can have a son	Tense action drama with plenty of lead slinging , torture , blood ; a plain out and out violent film . When 2 thugs go after a pregnant woman in order to ransom her out for big bucks things immediately go awry . The old boy they planned on cheating has some pretty tough boys on his side which leads to lots of gunsmoke and dead bodies . The final shootout was a doozy which should cause the saliva to flow from the lips of all action lovers . Woulda been easier to plug the bitch and start over . . . . but the baby was gonna be a boy .
532373	70535	37469	8.0	Man tries to cover up his crime	Very good film about a middle aged professor who becomes enmeshed in a crime of passion . He goes through an elaborate ordeal attempting to hide his deed . Meanwhile , his partner in crime is having problems with a clever thug who has figured out the basics of the offense . The professor becomes more and more distraught as his plans to escape the law go totally awry leading him to a final desperate act . The ending to this movie would be trite today , but played out well in this one .
533588	70535	67989	8.0	Cowboys corral cayuses , steer steers to Sedalia , and brawl , booze , and bang in beer bar	Best western featuring 2 unprincipled , ignorant saddle bums who decide to leave their employer and rob the local financial repository . Things go well for the pair until the willful son of their former boss gets on their trail and absolutely nothing will remove him from it . Tenacious little grubber played well by Tom Skerritt . He and his brother chase the bandits across a desert , over mountains , and through the snow until finally they meet in Monument Valley National Park . However , the thieves were a tad worse for wear seeing as they had a little trouble on the way during a friendly little game of poker . Except for a couple of sluggish moments this film moved along right nice like . Good performances , starkly beautiful scenery , and decent dialogue kept my interest all the way through . I especially liked the poker game scene : it was one of the better played out scenes in the picture . Morbid ending .
533051	70535	102316	8.0	Being smart has it's down side	A small boy who is shunned and disliked by his schoolmates is taken in by a woman who runs a school for gifted kids . All this is so the boy can realize his true potential when all he really wants is friends and to be liked . Well played out film with Foster and crew giving flawless performances .
532462	70535	100318	8.0	watch who you rent your apartments out to	Taut drama about a couple whose budget is stretched to the limit . They buy an old house and fix it up , intending to rent out rooms . One of the rooms is rented out to a scam artist who plans to use the couple and their home to his advantage . Frightening film .
533029	70535	88794	8.0	high school love and hijinx	Really funny show about a fickle high school girl who dumps her beau for a more popular guy . The dumpee spends the rest of the film trying to get this airhead back , which shows how intelligent he really is . This leads to all manner of adventures and mishaps which keep the viewer in stitches . One of Cusak's better movies .
532717	70535	55824	8.0	insane man terrorizes a family	Robert Mitchum was born for this role . He played the evil Max Cady as though Cady's spirit was actually inside him . Cady was a psychopathic murderer who became obsessed with a couple and their daughter . To counteract this persistent attention , the couple hired a security agent . When this went terribly wrong , the family made a run for their houseboat . Unfortunately , Cady was wise to them leading to a nail biting finale . 5 stars go to this great film .
532832	70535	63584	8.0	tense court-marshal drama	Sergeant Ryker is accused of being a traitor during the Korean War , a hanging offense . A long drawn out court-marshal ensues during which time the Sgt . must remain in a military jail . After much investigation the defense attorney attempts to exonerate the doomed non-com with an eleventh hour ploy . Very good picture .
533469	70535	55895	8.0	This film made me want to attend a AA meeting . . . . and I never drink	Started off a little slow but turned into one of the hottest dramas I've ever seen . Remick and Lemmon were sensational as the two drunks who couldn't control their actions after a few drinks . I had to laugh at some of their antics , but the greenhouse scene and especially the pitiful , horrible DT's in the rubber room were sobering indeed . Great picture showing the ravages and uselessness of booze .
533506	70535	118827	8.0	Man beats wife , then loses life	Very exciting film with a bang-up ending . This poor woman couldn't pick the right man with a set of ice tongs . As bad as hubby was , at least he wasn't a total psycho . Although this picture had some gaping holes in it [ for instance : why didn't the cop call for backup ? ] , it was still tense and dramatic . If I learned one thing from this movie , it was to always carry a backup modem connection .
532771	70535	161081	8.0	Good spooky chiller	This was a been there , done that film but I still wound up enjoying it immensely . Lots of creepy sound and sight effects , good performances , and a long , luxurious buildup to finding the solution to the wife's weird problems . My only gripe is the big finale : a little trite but done well enough as to not ruin the picture .
532990	70535	34780	8.0	The world's tightest man scores big with this one	This is one of the funniest films I've ever seen . A local station in Houston used to run this show on new year's eve and I would watch it every year . Few comics can top Benny and his deadpan delivery but Pa Kettle came close in this one as he played the slow motion yard man .
532449	70535	66811	8.0	TV station gets a hairy helping hand from the animal kingdom	One of the funniest comedies I've seen yet . What made this so was the interplay between Wally Cox and Joe Flynn [ one of my favorite comics ] . The bit on the building ledge was too much and had me rolling . The bellowing company prez was well played by Harry Morgan , a man I well remember from the early 60's sitcom " Pete & Gladys " where he played the put upon hubby , Pete Porter . John Ritter performed the snobbish , suck-up nephew to the hilt who , of course , gets his just payment in the end . 4 stars .
532626	70535	112818	9.0	Well done statement on human actions and justice	I understand this film is based on truth . If so , justice was served , although not in the fashion or time frame which I would have liked . The caring nun was well portrayed , I'm sure bleeding hearts like her abound in the religious structure . Her sympathy for the killer was misplaced , he deserved as violent a death as he dealt out to the 2 teens . If a person like that goes looking for trouble , then they should be able to take it when it comes to them . I wonder if the nun would have been so concerned with this creep's condition if it had been her family that was slain . The acting was superb , the dialogue intense and dramatic , and the story had a terrific punch as it dealt with a common happening in our society today . Excellent movie .
533389	70535	85995	9.0	Your typical American family goes on a nice , quiet trip	No , folks , these idiots are anything but typical . . . . or quiet . Chase was flawless as the bumbling Griswold , in fact all the performers did a good job . Usually , I don't find comedies entertaining or funny , but I ran out of breath laughing at this jerk and his goofy relations . I have seen pieces of a couple other of these ' trip ' pictures , and they didn't measure up to this one . 4 stars .
533400	70535	102753	9.0	sweet , oversexed girl has many adventures	This is told in flashback form . A middle aged man remembers a girl that came to live with his family when he was in his early teens . She was a very nice girl , but highly sexed . At one point she tried to seduce the father , which was the funniest scene in the film . The story of her life with the family , though brief , was interesting and well done . Rose was a free spirited girl that you couldn't help but love . Good show .
533194	70535	102343	9.0	cute show about 2 sweet kids falling in love	I love Sandra Bullock ; she is so cute in this kind of film . She plays an unlovely girl who is unable to make a connection with the opposite sex except as a bed partner . She works with a guy who is exactly like her - a loser . They discover a potion which makes them attractive to others . The show romps through a series of men and women coming on to them after they use the potion . Unfortunately , some rotten folks get their hands on the stuff and use it for their own nasty selves . But , the heroes work hard to stop these nefarious slugs from hatching their evil schemes . Funny and fun movie - 4 stars .
533192	70535	117119	9.0	hilarious spoof of American politicos	I laughed all the way through this one . One could call it " Grumpy Old Men Go To Washington " , it bore such a resemblance . Two ex-presidents get into hot water when the sitting president sends a rogue NSA agent to eliminate them , to hide one of his shenanigans . The entire film was centered around these 2 old geezers trying to outsmart and elude the agent and his thugs . Very good performances by Lemmon and Garner .
533147	70535	244296	9.0	Strange , hypnotic , bizarre . . . was there a message in there ?	Most enjoyable concert with loads of big name stars wearing funny get-ups and singing the utterly unique Roger Waters productions . I loved watching the Wall being built right there stone by stone and was captivated by the thing being dismantled rapidly in a falling thunder . Must have taken lots of time and energy to build this set , and even more to rehearse all the complicated numbers . Very expensive looking props were used which includes much more than the costumes : lots of trucks , flying machines , gun toting players running to and fro , and , of course , Cyndi's glorious wig . I gotta wonder at the mentality of someone who can come up with this much eccentricity in one program ; is Waters a genius or just some pssed off 60's jamboy ?
533306	70535	119822	10.0	Compulsive weirdo dates a waitress	Take a great story , brilliant acting , and biting , often hilarious dialogue , and you get one of the finest films around . Possibly Nicholson's best effort ever , and Helen Hunt was nothing short of sensational . Plus , you just gotta love Virdell . 5 stars and 2 thumbs up .
533517	70535	58576	10.0	Great drama that seems like it could happen	This was a fine story with excellent dialogue and performances . Taken from an equally fine book , it came off very realistically . Both the fanatically devoted General and the President presented well thought out and mostly correct objections to each other's philosophies . I felt both were a little bit right and wrong , and would have probably sided with the General except for fear of a military despot . Tense all the way to the end . 5 stars .
533180	70535	117438	10.0	One of the best thrillers I ever saw	Mel Gibson outdid himself in this great action drama . The suspense never let up for a second as the bad guys kept up with their threats and demands . I can't think of a better actor for the chief of the evil crew than Gary Sinise ; his portrayal of a demented sociopath was sterling . In fact the acting was so good that I sometimes became a part of the play . The ending of the show played out perfectly with much realism . Seldom have I been this impressed with a film . As usual Gibson is flawless .
533540	70535	99653	10.0	tragic , yet funny ghost tale	A man is murdered by a mugger and his ghost comes back to his girlfriend . She can't see him , but another woman can ; this woman convinces the girlfriend that he is there in spirit . One of the most tender and engrossing films of the 80's followed . The ending is guaranteed to soften the hardest heart . 5 stars .
533258	70535	112346	10.0	President scores hot babe in Oval Office	Excellent film depicting a single president and his aides efforts to keep his popularity high while juggling a couple of high profile bills and an affair with a liberal lobbyist . The producers didn't bother to hide the blatant anti-gun rhetoric which was a constant theme running throughout the entire showing . Pure propaganda that should be popular with those who think guns kill people .
533559	70535	281238	10.0	Good rockin ' tonight	Excellent concert featuring 2 of the rock scenes longest lasting and hardest rocking bands . Both group's put on a high voltage , exciting show with lots of the physical as well musical movements . Whereas I really like both bands and particularly go for the riffs of Dave Amato , I thought Styx was the more electric of the two .
