533511	70535	56435	1.0	Safe at home ! But out at Home Box Office .	What a stinker ! I called this turkey out before it reached first base . Ok , it was one of those cutsey films for the whole family with a message at the end , but . . . . What about the M & M boys , you ask ? Don't , please . I've seen more animation from a corpse . A cigar store indian has more life to it . Even a diehard yankee follower would heave his guts up watching this bilge . Want a more entertaining hour and a half ? Go watch paint dry . Gad !
533349	70535	43743	1.0	Part comedy , part suspense , all bad	Excruciatingly boring tale of a thief who steals a famous painting for another man and then double crosses him . Along the way a young woman is brought into the deal to create a forgery of the painting and she winds up falling for one of the crooks . This crushing bore went on interminably as the 2 groups went about trying to outwit each other and come into possession of the valuable piece of art . Worse than " Canvas " , another stupid ' art theft ' movie .
533519	70535	65511	1.0	Namath gets sacked again . . . . this time by the critics	Joe threw the biggest bomb of his career and unfortunately it was intercepted by the viewers . This wasn't the stupidest film I've ever seen , but close . It wasn't the poorest performed , but mighty close . It was awfully close to being the most boring experience of my movie career ; even Ann M . couldn't help in that area . Smooth Joe just didn't come off as an Hell's Angel type , he's just to nice looking . And that sandwich building crap at the beginning . . . what amateurism . Get half drunk with some buddies and maybe this stumpwater will be palatable . Maybe .
532806	70535	91828	1.0	a raw deal for anyone who watches this turkey	How this gets filmed is beyond me . It has every cliche in the book , several times over . Not even a good action movie , although there was plenty of it to go around . Lousy filming , lousy acting , lousy plot , lousy action scenes . It will go down in my book as one of the most boring , stupid movies I have ever seen . Arnold took the money and ran on this one . , 000 , 000 of a star . Thumbs down and dirty . What a bomb ! !
532714	70535	120008	1.0	long on gunfire , short on story	This movie was plain sorry . Thin plot , pitiful acting , senseless action scenes . This was just another program aimed at the mindless action crowd . Two or three million rounds were fired between 2 groups at odds with each other . Very few of them hit their targets . . . who teaches these hit men to shoot ? This was nothing but " Last Man Standing " done in Chinatown . Instead of hiring a high priced actor like Bruce Willis to make the film , the producers opted for some Chinese guy named Lo Fat Wu or whatever . His performance was a joke ; I haven't seen this much ham since last Thanksgiving . 2 thumbs down .
532625	70535	111359	1.0	Should have called this one ' Small Tail "	I searched for one word to describe this film and came up with dumb . That seems to fit the entire boring , badly acted , silly scripted , nonsensical mess . What was Swayze doing in this production anyway , he is usually in a more mainstream element ? I doubt if even a child got anything out of this screwy movie . I can't say anymore , it was just a bad show .
532803	70535	87332	1.0	very boring , idiotic bilge	Another popular film that to me is simply awful . This was supposed to be funny , but was just plain silly . Badly written , but could have been an ok film had it been done slightly more seriously . I know it was meant to be a comedy , and that is ok . However , it just didn't play as written . Really abysmal . 1 star .
532923	70535	78767	1.0	Not one bit scarey	Well , I paid good money to be frightened , and all I did was yawn . The story was ineffective , the acting was abysmal , the evening was a total loss . I've been more scared walking thru the local church's haunted house at the end of October . This turkey should be thoroughly cooked and buried deep .
532491	70535	87175	1.0	Dull dream drama	This was a total wipeout : not one minute amount , not a smattering , of anything worth seeing . I usually like Quaid but he had nothing to work with on this flopperoo . The cycle scene was particularly annoying ; the guy could barely ride it off at first , then he is makes a spectacular jump successfully shortly thereafter . Who was the dude who looked like Russell Crowe ? Had me going for a bit .
532809	70535	98439	1.0	boring cop show	Too bad the writers in tinsel town couldn't come up with a better program than this . Should have called it " Bango and Trash " , because that is what it did and what it was . Boring action scenes , dumb plot that has been done a million times , and uninspired acting . And why not ? I couldn't get excited listening to and watching this drivel , why should I expect anything else from the actors ? Don't waste your time with this camel dung . th star .
532386	70535	59885	1.0	This train should have been derailed in the station	Who in the name of all that is holy came up with this puppy excrement ? Who ever heard of a middle aged geezer flying missions against der fuerer ? What was the purpose of mis-casting Frank Snotra as the smooth talking flyboy ; because he was just as slick off camera ? The POW's were out in a desert area but ol ' brown eyes just had to don that leather jacket before he could even go to the latrine . If the Italians were as inept as this bunch , it's no wonder they had to bow out of the war early . Out of all the phony ' excitement ' shoveled up in this mess , I gotta say the kraut troop train that stopped on a dime after noticing the missing rail was my best belly laugh . Even on a boring rainy afternoon you'd be ahead picking up a good novel over viewing this drivel . Thumbs down .
532681	70535	48078	3.0	One of the worst movies ever	What was good for westerns was equally bad for the horror genre . . . and that was Roger Corman's leaving one and going to the other . What a goofy idea this was for something called entertainment . The Confederate Army was in such bad shape it had to recruit a group of scumbags from death row to bring in a traitor and 30K in gold . They couldn't find a few men in the ranks who could do the job ? Just couldn't make it without employing a handful of untrustworthy thieves and killers ? Way beyond stupid . Seldom have I seen cornier more overblown performances . And those fight scenes ! A class of sixth graders could have been more convincing . Avoid this claptrap .
532974	70535	64615	3.0	bad guys go for the gold	Bad guy forces a sheriff to lead him and his band in search of a hoard of gold . They must go high into the mountains , and while there they cross paths with some evil cavalry men . Then a group of rascally citizens and a band of injuns take an interest in things . Below average western , not enough action and excitement . Hokey plot , hammy acting .
533020	70535	58725	3.0	Not just a bore . . . a MONUMENTAL bore	Boy , was this typical Presley . Inane , dull , and insipid from the word go . Ridiculous story , lacklustre performances that were so put on a group of high schoolers could have done better . A few good song and dance routines , in particular E's Viva Las Vegas sequence . But folks , this junk went nowhere . The most noteworthy thing about the whole mess was that for once the Big E didn't have a fight scene - he usually has to beat the hell out of somebody with his phony karate moves . What a wimpy looking pugilist he is . Avoid this one at all costs .
532532	70535	88852	3.0	Standard 80's TV fare	Another in a long line of Jack the Ripper returns movies . Every cornball cliche in the book was in this dull , routine , totally predictable yawner . A big city cop moves to Arizona as a way to avoid stress after a bad incident in Chicago . However , he runs into even more pressure when he gets on the trail of a serial murderer who slays in exactly the same fashion as the notorious 19th century London killer . Gad , what a stupid film .
532426	70535	35896	3.0	huggy , kissy war drudgery	One of the most boring movies I've ever sat through . I kept waiting for some action , and finally got some at the end , but mostly what I saw was a middle aged yankee going bonkers over a very un-Spanish looking woman . There was an overabundance of arguing and infighting among the rebels which accounted for an overabundance of dreary dialogue . Had the entire film been as fast paced as the final 20 minutes , I would have been far more satisfied .
532412	70535	111301	4.0	Absolute rot	Typical Van Damme theatrics as he leads a band of AN [ a thinly disguised glorification of the UN ] forces , taking on a madman dictator intent on world domination . How unusual ! Many full auto magazines emptied , much screaming , and boatloads of martial arts techniques . Phony and totally lacking in realism , but action fans should love it .
532742	70535	53559	4.0	Ghouls , glasses , ghosts & greed = garbage	I never could figure out if this was a black comedy or a serious spook flic . Either way it was one of the goofiest , cornball attempts at film making I've seen lately . The plot was more transparent than any of the spirits . The lame acting and overdone facial expressions coupled with the 40 year old special effects made for a real yawner . This junk would give Anton Phibes nightmares .
533574	70535	63210	5.0	IL ' cross eyes does it again . . . . . fails , that is	Another bland concoction featuring the boozy , down-on-his-luck read : lazy Tony Rome . While not as goofy , just almost , as " Tony Rome " , I still enjoyed the cornball humor and tough guy action especially from Dan Blockbuster as he waltzed through his big and bad bit . Had to snort at the unseen nod to " Bonanza " , somehow I knew that would pop up . Maybe Lorne Green should have been the lead instead of Snotra , eh ? The only bright spot in this gibberish was the sensational Lanie Kazan and her go-go dancing self . Even an ' in her heyday ' Raquel couldn't hold a candle to this voluptuous doll . OK , she could too hold a candle but it didn't shine with the fervor of Kazan's . Actually , the better title for this turkey would have been " Lady in Concrete " since cement is the wet form of concrete . Or , how about " Concrete Blonde " ?
532423	70535	41890	5.0	Farm life in the early 20th century	A small boy becomes emotionally attached to a new born black lamb and decides to enter it in the county fair . Living with his stern Granny on a farm means there is little money for frivolities , so the youngster goes out and gets the needed funds the old fashioned way . . . he earned them . Many things conspire to halt the trip to the fair : most brought on by the critter itself , but , of course , the lad and his pet enter the competition . There are lots of songs and animation in this dated but still enjoyable film , which also carries a simple but solid message about dealing with life's good and bad times .
533464	70535	167049	5.0	kids help dad get a date	The 2 cutest kids in the world decide to help their dad rope in a mate by advertising his stats for all the world to see . . . . much to dad's chagrin . Naturally , this leads to adventures for the girls and romance for dad . The usual stuff from the Olsons ' : in other words , no great shakes , but a fun time just the same .
532485	70535	113028	5.0	Predictable adventure yarn	Why can't Hollywood come up with something besides the same old stuff that plays out exactly as you know it will ? Every cliche in the " boy lost in the wilderness " tale was brought out , dusted off , and run a little deeper into the turf . This kid was supposed to have had training in the survival arts , but he didn't have a clue as to the first rule when lost . . . stay put . He just kept walking farther and farther away from his rescuers while mom and pop were at home wringing their hands in agony . Of course , there was another of those idiotic wolf attacks . Enough with the wolf attacks !
532424	70535	108559	5.0	Adventure plot # 1 -	Not a bad production [ but certainly , not good ] , and the scenery was splendid , but this was a re-make of a tired old storyline . A group of teens [ a couple of which looked 25 or so ] head for the mountains for a several days long trek . Naturally things go awry as a terrible tragedy befalls the group . As the gallant crew struggles to overcome their sticky situation , they are hindered by rugged terrain , wild critters , and raging rivers . The only bright spot for them was a mysterious white wolf who appeared when things got really desperate . The mutt didn't really do anything , just hung around lending wolfly moral support , I suppose . Many of the action sequences were choppy , unrealistic formula stuff no different than any other in this genre . The younger set should be able to overlook this and thoroughly enjoy the picture . . . I couldn't .
533056	70535	97500	5.0	I coulda been watching the IFC channel	Occasionally amusing but for the most part I just sat there and watched these folks go through their paces . This was merely one of those pictures created to fill up a film reel and make a nice payday for a big name actor . A pointless exercise in tedium .
533331	70535	70047	5.0	bland look at demonic possession	A little girl becomes possessed by demons . Her mother becomes upset and calls in a group of Catholic ghostbusters . The little girl talks funny , levitates , and makes ugly faces . The priests bust the ghost and all live happily ever after . What a droll film . yawn
532758	70535	85154	5.0	rah rah rah blah blah blah	While this wasn't a throwaway it didn't garner any extra points with me either . Most of the characters aggravated me to no end ; the little girls who were ' in love ' , the jock who impregnates his girlfriend [ read : slut ] and then blathers ' it is what I really want ' [ this pea brain has no clue to what he ' wants ' ] , the stupid townies who go ape over their team getting the big win , and the typical ' coach ' [ read : sadistic dumbass ] whose sole objective is winning , winning , winning . Yeah , it all came together in the end but how hokey can you get ?
533277	70535	74608	5.0	2 groups attempt robbing the same bank	A pair of inept vaudevillians team up with a liberal newswoman to rob a bank . Her reasons were for the furtherance of mankind . At the same time a notorious thief and his gang are plotting the same job . The reason he uses is simple revenge . This was pretty banal stuff , but was fairly entertaining and had a ridiculously funny ending .
533337	70535	81375	5.0	No laughs to be had in this ' comedy '	I heard nothing but glowing comments on this film for years , but when I finally saw it there was no laughter from me . I sat straight faced all the way through waiting impatiently for the fun to start . All I saw was a poorly made movie with a silly plot and uninspired performances . Bypass this turkey .
533556	70535	104187	5.0	Run of the mill comedy	Same old stuff here as 2 30 year old high school lads unearth a quick frozen apeman and turn him into hot property around school . He presents a bad boy image so the girls go for him . Being an amazingly quick study , especially for a Neanderthal , he learns how to be a 90's kinda guy real fast [ I suppose this is done to hurry the film along so all the teens won't get bored ] . Not horrid , but merely the same old , same old .
532946	70535	155110	5.0	Spoiled brat ruins Christmas for Richie	After being sabotaged on his yearly Christmas run to the orphans home , Richie Rich begins feeling sorry for himself and wishes he was never born . What happens is a total surprise to the boy and leads to situation much worse than the one he was so upset over . Some of the acting was extremely bad as was much of the tale ; so silly it was pretty much for kids only . The one truly bright spot was the beastly little Reggie Rich , a little snot I would take pleasure in permanently maiming .
533071	70535	104070	5.0	so-so film about 2 women who can't stand aging	Two women compete with each other , seeing who can stay the youngest looking . Both go to a beautiful witch who has a youth potion , but they get more than they bargained for . Not all that funny to me .
532431	70535	104577	6.0	Not even in your imagination , lady	Innocuous little filler film offering work to low rent actor , Tom Wopat . Were it not for the " Dukes Of Hazard " this performer would still be parking cars and pumping gas . Not much to say in favor of this , it was watchable but just barely .
533580	70535	76489	6.0	Oh , brother !	Dated but cute look at God's take on people and their reaction to him . I didn't think the film was particularly amusing , but I did appreciate some of God's thoughts on how we earthlings could work to get along better . Seemed to me as though the producer concocted a humanistic , feel good creator as opposed to a more demanding one which is what we really have . No doubt the makers of Oh , God felt HE would be more palatable in this form .
532736	70535	45502	6.0	Ex-cons hunt for missing loot	Four released convicts go back to the ghost town of Tomahawk Gap searching for the Army payroll they stole several years earlier . Not only did they have trouble finding the money , but they had to deal with a horde of mean , bloodthirsty indians and a couple of conniving white men intent on getting the money or themselves . Typical western with plenty of gunplay , horses , and action .
533409	70535	62824	6.0	Pilot film for the Dirty Harry series ?	Fairly good show about an Arizona Ranger extraditing a prisoner from NYC back to Arizona . The guy escapes and Clint spent the rest of the movie chasing after him . Nothing special .
533264	70535	73559	6.0	The good , the bad , and the stupid	Not a bad western , but not a real winner either . Most of the acting was good , but some of the performers need to go back to drama class and bone up a bit . Douglas and Dern kept the show going with their give and take , although I don't think the real lawmen and desperados actually carried on in this fashion . I think Strawhorn was more of a realist than a truly bad person ; he saw the reality of life and became practical because of his vision . Dealing with 2 faced con men like Nightingale merely solidified his outlook on life .
533487	70535	51349	6.0	Cavalry + Indians + Guns = Trouble in the old west	A partially decimated Army unit teams up with a group of cowboys , who also had been hit by renegade injuns . The cavalry squad was trying to get a gun runner and 3 dozen rifles back to their fort , but had to fight their way through fierce indian raiders intent on getting the weapons . Average soldier vs . redskin shoot-em-up .
532579	70535	192255	6.0	Not your usual vampire flic	A long way from the great Ann Rice and Stephen King tales of the undead . I liked seeing the vamps played as the victim , having to deal with a crazed hunter of their kind , and watching their growing friendship with a mortal who can mysteriously aid in their quest to return to their own far off world . Totally enjoyable and , unlike Trix , not just for kids .
532489	70535	85622	7.0	Once a thief . . . .	Good movie with an old timey look to it . Not a big shoot-em-up western , but filmed more like a real life story would go . Well acted with a believable feel to it , but I objected , once again , to Hollywood putting their spin on a common criminal , building him up as some kind of nice person . This " gentleman " and his gang were armed robbers who shot it out with a guard who was doing his job : this gent also pulled a gun on another man and threatened his life . He also roughed up one of his henchmen for a comment on the " gentleman's " woman friend . A kindly old man doing a service to his community ? Hardly . Just a thief who belonged behind bars .
533041	70535	279778	7.0	These girls had a strange club going	Better like lots of flashback because this film is full of it as it bounces back and forth over several decades . The viewer must stay the course to find the secret of the sisterhood and why one of the girls grew up skewed off center causing years of grief for her entire family . A resounding " yes " to this one .
532885	70535	83908	7.0	Why would anybody want to hurt this wonderful person ?	This film slowly builds up to the big murder , which I easily saw coming . This person was just begging for it . . . . but not for the reasons I supposed . Once the crime took place , Hercule Poirot stepped in and began his overbearing investigation . Who asked him ? Where does he get the authority ? Telling the suspects not to leave the island like he is a police officer : he has no right at all to do this . I would have told the overweight , pompous ass to go suck an egg . All this aside , even though the show was slow moving , it played out to be a good whodunnit . As usual with ' ol Hercule , he gathered all the suspects together and explained the entire scheme before finally naming the dirty , rotten scoundrel and explaining the nefarious doings . Better than many of it's ilk , plus the Spainish scenery was breath taking .
533327	70535	105378	7.0	Vigilantes , hookers , circus folks , and a killer	An inept man is coerced into joining a band of vigilantes who are stalking a murderous psycho . As he goes through the motions of vigilantism he falls in with a circus girl , meets a group of jaded prostitutes , becomes a murder suspect , and finally comes face to face with the killer himself . Like most of Allen's films , this one came in from left field . Go see it .
532552	70535	89601	7.0	This guy got just what he wished for	Fun little teeny bop film loaded with cool cats , fine babes , tough punks and their slick cars , and lots of teen-age angst and woes . I did hear a couple of tunes that came out well past ' 56 , but who cares , it was a good soundtrack . Had the movie continued into the future we would have seen the immediate pregnancy , arguing over money , Gene's growing gut / receding hair , and , of course , the unavoidable divorce . I hate it when reality creeps in , so I merely let the film's finale fool me . Watch for Jonathan's oh so subtle across time joke in the diner . Too cool .
532680	70535	48055	7.0	Cynical cowpoke strikes out for the high country	After losing his cattle herd to a dishonest lawman , a trail boss winds up in the Yukon gold fields with a bad reputation and small chances of being able to return to the states . While there his fortunes take a turn for the best until a bad luck specter from the past comes calling . Good western with many favorite old faces in the lineup .
532631	70535	66473	7.0	Few people realize that tora means kill in Japanese	No doubt a lot of fiction went on here , but many of the events rang true . The Nips had a good plan , however if the U . S . big wigs not had their heads inserted so firmly into their own rectums much of the carnage could have been avoided . A big help to the invaders was indifferent , timid officers and those who merely refused to believe an attack would come . This was a very good look at one of the most talked about battles in history and an even better glimpse into the idiotic military mindset and why one should avoid conscription , or worse , foolishly volunteering during a moment of patriotic fervor .
533529	70535	47977	7.0	Davey Crockett can whup Sonny Crockett's ass !	When I first watched this production back during the stone age , I thought it was a grand epic . I find out all these years later that it was indeed not so grand . The fight scenes were totally faked looking , the dialogue was way beyond corny , and , obviously , much of the scenery was painted . If this turkey ever gets re-released the price of ham and corn will skyrocket . I enjoyed seeing it again , but it was definitely a fourth rate film by today's standards . I'll wager the real Davey wasn't as handsome as Fess , and stunk like a piney woods rooter in a mud waller . And did he really have such a clever , amusing , home-grown wit ? Also , why was he killing all those hispanics ? It was their property .
532571	70535	112950	7.0	Never hire a teen !	This film started off annoying the hell out of me but ended up as a total delight . Here we have several very mixed up kids full of angst and various problems making life miserable for a record store manager . . . . and , at times , each other . Good comedy ; the kids , with their crazy cutting up and , at times , profound thoughts , kept me completely entertained throughout . 4 stars .
532918	70535	67756	7.0	Treehugger is one twig short of a limb	Earth has no more greenery so a idealistic outer space landscaper becomes convinced he can keep the various species alive under a space bubble . His insanity proves more than he can handle and in a deranged state he commits a terrible crime which his conscience refuses to allow him to live with . One of Dern's better films .
532940	70535	96179	7.0	Uncaring thugs attack those who are different	A small town is thrown into turmoil when four youths go on trial for a heinous crime against a neighboring Amish family . Many of the townspeople felt harassing the Amish for being different was merely harmless sport , but an idealistic young prosecutor brought charges for a hateful , intolerant act . The only witness against the criminals was a 7 year old girl whose father refused her entry into the trial on religious grounds which undermined almost all of the prosecutor's efforts at an indictment . Good film showing the stupidity of those with a superior attitude .
533557	70535	309377	7.0	Harry done got old	Average serial killer show picturing an aging cop able to run block after block before having an acute myocardial infarction . Interesting story but a little too pat for me ; I actually guessed the killer well before he showed his true colors - a rare event for me . All the usual characters ; tough cops , a female boss with the proper ethnicity , shrewd bad guy , and a near genius super cop who knows not the meaning of quit .
532896	70535	83111	7.0	Stupidity knows no bounds	If the real National Guard is as inept as these dumbasses then no enemy need worry about mounting an attack at any time . I spent almost the entire couple of hours rooting for the cajuns to put these morons out of their ignorant misery . Not a bad film , but not a real winner either : there were simply to many holes for comfort . For instance , Coach went psycho way to quick , the cajuns couldn't possibly predict the route the soldiers would take in order to set traps and deposit the bodies of their buddies , and the cajuns wouldn't suddenly become lousy shots once they had the final two guardsmen trapped . Finally , could a squad of men really be this dumb ? It wasn't all downhill however : the private losing his nerve and the squad leader doing the ' Rambo ' like some meatheaded jerk were all to realistic . Worth seeing , but just barely .
533466	70535	71970	7.0	Geraldo Rivera wannabe gets in over his head	Spellbinding drama which kept me on the edge all the way through even though it was unbelievable and holey . As is always the case with this type of film I was somewhat in the dark as to who was who , who the bad guys really worked for , their agenda , etc . Still an enjoyable couple of hours with the always good Warren Beatty .
533084	70535	113238	7.0	Gunhawk slings lead , tough men fall dead	I liked this one ok even though it was filled with overzealous actors who either paid no attention to their director or this manager offered no direction at all . The facial expressions and body movements were so overdone as to be hilarious . The one player who had any experience with gun handling was relegated to playing a loser who couldn't even draw his piece without breaking it open and spilling out the rounds . The biggest drawback to this film came when the seriously wounded gunfighter left his sickbed and hobbled off to exchange lead with 3 blood hungry thugs . No way , Jose . I thought we were going to be hit with a ' Shane ' moment there at the end but , thankfully , it never came to pass . At least there were no hay bales laying around as there are in many westerns . Fun but dumb .
532917	70535	70030	7.0	Sadistic yard bull takes on the King of the Road	Ernest Borgnine was superb as the murderous railroad agent intent on keeping a legendary hobo off his train . Lee Marvin gave one of his best performances as A # 1 , the hobo's hobo , who is equally set on riding the rails on Borgnine's unrideable # 19 . Keith Carradine almost stole the show as a useless , me first punk out to prove his manhood in the harsh hobo camps . Very realistic looking sets and the entire film captured the flavor of the depression era perfectly . 4 stars .
532596	70535	43379	7.0	Stuffed shirt British sea cap'n fights and loves his way across the 7 seas	The good cap'n does battle with the evil Napoleon Bonaparte , while wooing the lovely Lady Wellesley . Lots of canvas fell on folks heads as the cannon roared , but Cap'n H . and his lusty lads prevailed . This was a good show with colorful costumes and some nice action sequences , but some of the dialogue was a tad hokey . For my money they could have left Lady W . on shore and had a couple more fights - too much confounded smoochin ' . 3 stars .
532603	70535	284519	7.0	The Queen of Rock n ' Roll rocks on a rock	Interesting , but somewhat disjointed rockumentary showing Stevie and band doing several of her hit songs . This film does what a lot of these concert footage shows do and that is throw in the overdubbed " screensaver " crap instead of leaving the camera where it belongs . . . . on the performer . The high point of the whole thing was when , as Stevie is taking her bows and doing the feely / touchie thing with the stage side crowd , Waddy Wachtel is soaring off in the ozone with some sensational peals of pure R & R guitar riffing . I always liked his style and , for me at least , he stole the show . It was fun seeing Mick again , what little he was on camera [ which was very little ] .
532383	70535	120303	7.0	Ever felt like an outsider ? Sure , lots of times .	Interesting and well done look at the American pop scene in the sexy sixties . Featuring a oversexed , insecure loser named Karchy who teams up with another oversexed loser disc jockey intent on preying and playing just one more gig in the nowhere business of top 40 music . The charismatic DJ , a burned out cynic , has a history of using unpopular teens to make illegal profits or to cheat them in business deals ; which , of course , continues as he rolls into a new town amid a flurry of excitement and adulation . As the rollicking DJ and the impressionable teen play out their drama , another is occurring as Karchy tries to woo an older woman who , for some reason , shows an interest in the love struck teen . Different from most of the gunk coming out today : well worth seeing .
533038	70535	95800	7.0	Orphaned cub goes it alone in the forest	After losing it's mother to an accident , a young bear must strike out on it's own to survive . Along the way the cub gets into some hilarious , sometimes dangerous , situations . Aided many times by an older grizzly boar , the little feller learns the lessons of life .
533436	70535	288039	7.0	Only white folks can hate	Morris Dees gives the viewer a one sided view of how hate works in America . According to Dees there are no hate crimes committed by blacks , browns , Orientals , or anyone other than white people . This was an interesting documentary on the insanity of those who harm others because of their color or beliefs , but totally lopsided . I suspect Mr . Dees has his own agenda , and it isn't based on his " caring for the downtrodden " .
533076	70535	119432	7.0	jungle boy comes to live in the big city	A man brings his son from the jungle to live with him in the city . Of course , the child knows nothing of civilization , therefore everything he does is based on how he would do it in the wilds . In other words , he turns his dad's life upside down , causing him a world of stress and aggravation . Very funny film .
532668	70535	183790	7.0	Rags to riches , love conquers all , never say quit , go for your dreams . . . .	Fun little tale of a dirt poor lad willing to go all out for his lady love , his honor , and to prove he is as good as any other warrior . Plenty of laughs from a zany character or two and a grand adventure with plenty of old world jousting , pageantry , and costumes . Loved the way the producers wove hard rock tunes and today's lingo into the show's fabric and made it seem , usually anyway , as thought it fit that time span . Cool flic .
532553	70535	74937	7.0	Amusingly goofy	Nonsensical spoof never intended to make sense but merely to entertain - which it did . Whereas I didn't find it rolling in the aisles funny I did get plenty of grins ; I especially liked the plays on words and all that mask ripping at the end was a howl .
533081	70535	125439	7.0	Could this really happen ? Yes , it could .	Once again Hugh Grant convinces me he is one of the trade's finest assets . Spike , however , made for most of the laughs in this nicely done romance . I don't consider it to be the best of the romantic comedies , but it really hit the spot for me . Partly , I'm sure , because something similar happened to me back in the mid-90's when I had an intense 8 month fling with Sandra Bullock which , unfortunately , ended not as sweetly as Notting Hill . Thumbs up .
532458	70535	100224	7.0	They shoulda took the bus	A team of professional killers attempt to silence a witness who can i . d . their boss in a murder case . On a long train ride across Canada , a D . A . and the witness must evade the hitmen long enough to reach a large city and safety . High voltage tension all the way with enough stress to raise anybody's blood pressure 10 points or more .
532953	70535	104201	7.0	strange characters populate an unfeeling city	An old woman dies and leaves an unopened letter from years in the past . A morgue attendant takes the letter and finds that it contains information about a trust fund involving twins . She hunts down the twins , figuring on sharing the money and writing a tale based on the proceedings . As she is doing this the separate lives of the twins is unfolding in a jumbled montage . This film reminded me of " Pulp Fiction " in the disconnected way in which it was filmed . Oddball picture , but well worth the seeing .
532799	70535	109783	7.0	Cool , funny comedy	When a woman suddenly begins to believe her life hasn't been everything she thinks it should have been she wants to go back and rekindle an old flame . This starts a chain of events involving a mystery pregnancy , a jealous boyfriend and hubby , sexy fantasies , hurt feelings , oddball characters , and loads of laughs . Different , offbeat romantic comedy . . . . loved it .
532354	70535	69496	7.0	Rednecks , rodeo , redskins , rotgut , & Richard	Widmark plays the drunken , former rodeo rider to perfection , & Frederick Forrest does admirably as the put upon young bull rider . I felt most of the other players were of the Grade B variety , as was this production in many ways . Not as good as " J . W . Coop " .
533359	70535	109585	7.0	If you look for trouble you will find it	When a successful lady attorney goes slumming she always takes up with the wrong man in her search for excitement . Her lust for this secret lifestyle stemmed from a unhappy , fearful childhood which led to her becoming a high end tramp who gets more than she bargained for after her fake ' nightlife ' ID is blown by a clever scumbag who wanted more of her favors . However , he wasn't the one she had to worry about as it appeared for a more deadly game was afoot from a quarter she wasn't expecting . Good show , but nothing new .
532615	70535	60086	7.0	Stud cavorts with the ladies	Sex fiend tries to bed every woman he meets in jolly old England . This leads to many problems for the old chap , but he continues his ways leading to even more troubles . A classic example of the little head doing the thinking for the big head . Entertaining and interesting picture ; I particularly liked the way Alfie would address the camera as though talking to me personally .
532663	70535	51393	7.0	Gold , greed and revenge	An ex-con and a fellow inmate seek revenge and a high dollar payday in developing a plot to strip a supposedly mined out vein and selling the contents to a shady tycoon . Is revenge stronger than a lust for more financial gain by a double crossing man and his shady lawman friend ? Good western with lots of fisticuffs , gunplay , and a tense , explosive finale .
533425	70535	40202	7.0	reporter sets out to prove a convicted man is innocent	An eyewitness to a cop killing sends a man to the pen for 99 years . Eleven years later the convict's mother offers 5 thousand dollars to anyone proving her son is not guilty . A newspaperman looks into the case and becomes obsessed with gathering information which he is convinced will exonerate the convicted man . Tense , dramatic look at the seedy side of life .
532796	70535	105691	7.0	Standard whodunnit	Fairly good story about a 2 bit scoundrel private eye who apparently becomes involved in a double homicide while running a sleazy con game . A large insurance settlement is at stake and the police must figure out if the victim's wife did the deed or if it was her rival , hubby's mistress . Or could it have been someone else . . . . . ?
533036	70535	48171	7.0	Swab jockeys woo dames , get in dutch with the Shore Patrol	Three sailors can't stay out of trouble . Be it with the girls , mom , or conniving dandies . Plenty of action is provided through song and dance routines where everyone gives fine performances . While this was not a great musical , it was still a nice little story with some good funny spots supplied by J . Carroll Naish and Alan King .
532644	70535	90728	7.0	Stupid , yet fun and entertaining	This must have been written by the same guy that did the Jackie Chan films . Anybody who likes all that far out Kung-fu crap will be right at home with this one . Lots of colorful costumes and cool sets , along with some goofy comedy kept me glued to the screen all the way . Russell was perfect as the verbose , confused trucker . Thumbs up .
533298	70535	103644	7.0	Another bloodbath in outer space	The world's baddest chick takes on the beast that refuses to die one more time . The usual ' monster lunches on man who is trapped ' bit with Weaver , as always , trying to outfox the creature . Odd camera work and lots of activity made for an exciting finale . Not bad , but been there .
532411	70535	110366	7.0	brats run amok	I laughed my head off at these ill behaved little rapscallions . However , in the real world I would have cheerfully kicked their rascally little butts . Nothing realistic about the behavior of these kids at all , but I don't think that was intended . Lots of zany antics [ some re-done from the old shorts from years back ] and many belly laughs left me feeling good after the film was over . Thumbs up .
532977	70535	118632	8.0	devout man wages war inside himself between the flesh and spirituality	Excellent picture dealing with a holiness preacher who strays from the flock fairly regularly . This causes him trouble with the church elders and his wife . He goes on a spiritual odyssey to find what God has in store for him , and winds up founding a new church in a backwoods community . Unfortunately , his troubles are not over with even there . Well written story about how a Christian must constantly try and overcome Satanic influences .
533231	70535	264441	8.0	Street punk goes back in time	A street smart Detroit rapper suffers a trauma which sends him back to the year 1822 in the deep south . He falls into the hands of slavers and is sold as a fieldhand , receiving a first hand education in life as an indentured worker . A funny yet grim look at early America .
532980	70535	275309	8.0	Hooligans ride their boards to . . . . . where ?	A group of teen-age punks with a burning need to ride a piece of wood with wheels run rampant through L . A . They let nothing get in the way of their " sport " which consisted of whizzing around on their boards getting low and grabbing air . Many of these kids came from broken homes and , having no supervision at all , were turned loose to waste their lives ' sidewalk surfing ' while harassing others who came into contact with them . Some of these little thugs grew up and did alright ; others formed their own broken homes , giving life to a new generation of castoffs , while one did a stint in the pen . Excellent documentary showing how lives can become a disaster when parents show no interest .
533129	70535	105078	8.0	A barrel of fun and laughs	An executive leaves his hometown to complete a $140M deal . Along the way he loses his wallet which contains the main ingredient for closing the deal . While trying to get the wallet back he meets every manner of opposition and zany characters . I really liked Jim & Jim and the Siskle & Ebert clones . One of the funniest comedies I ever saw . 4 stars .
532911	70535	50371	8.0	Hilariously dramatic	One of the best pictures I've seen to date . Griffith had the part of the womanizing , opinionated , lazy , loud mouthed bum down pat . In fact , the entire cast was superb in this dynamic , gripping , and in the first half , uproariously funny drama which clearly shows how ego can not only destroy the egotist but those close to him . This film is an equal to Griffith's fine performances as Horton Maddock in " Savages " and Howard Pike in " Hearts of the West " . 4 stars .
532408	70535	77928	8.0	life in a Turkish prison	A young man goes to Turkey with a plan to bring home a few squares of hash . This plan fails as he is apprehended at the airport . Sentenced to life in prison , he must endure the hell of a filthy , dangerous existence . This was a terrifying , graphic look at confinement in a foreign jail .
532979	70535	171410	8.0	a man of principle sets out to make things right	This is the best film that I've ever seen Cusack in . He plays a family man that is unfairly taken advantage of by a wealthy land owner . After failing to obtain satisfaction through the courts , he feels compelled to take matters into his own hands . L . Q . Jones was superb as the villainous land owner ; in fact , the picture was well done by all . Thumbs up .
532935	70535	120749	8.0	Another Willis butt kicking session	Bruce lets go in this action film done in the proud diehard tradition , though not as stupid as the last one . The bodies piled up as the combatants blasted their way across town with high capacity handguns and automatic rifles . Predictable Bruce Willis plot and outcome , but still tense and exciting .
533501	70535	47954	8.0	One of the better westerns	A former drinker and womanizer , returned from the Civil War , comes home as a newly converted preacher . He takes up residence in the old parsonage with a high spirited young girl and begins rebuilding the church . He finds a lot of trouble along the way , mostly from the local store owner who resents the new preacher because he fought for the north . Lots of action and drama made for a very good picture and Joanne Woodward as the rambunctious Lissy stole the show . She had me laughing all the way through . 4 stars .
532461	70535	83806	8.0	who-dun-it with several twists	Very good dramatic comedy about a playwright trying to figure out how to keep his head above water after running out of ideas . Can't say much about this film without giving away the story . I can say that little was as it seems as you are watching the picture . Everybody has his or her own agenda . Nice little surprise at the end - after all the other surprises . Well written with good performances by all .
532624	70535	110997	8.0	Great action movie with beautiful scenery	The best actress of them all was in this exciting film . Admittedly , the story was an old one with the usual predictable ending , but I love just about anything with Streep in it . She is so believable in her parts . Kevin Bacon acted the part of a psycho very well . The sequences shot at the waterfalls kept the adrenaline flowing in this fast paced thriller .
532741	70535	87337	8.0	ex-Beatle Paul rocks the casbah	Tissue paper thin story used completely as an excuse for Paul and friends to conjure up a series of music videos . And ruddy good tunes they were . Loved watching the band go through several fine songs , many of which I had never before heard . The story had Paul and cohorts searching for a set of missing tapes , leading the viewer through a series of flashbacks and dreamscapes which gave the film a magically mysterious sensation . The picture at times had that baked feel I was used to from early Beatle flickers . . . . only this was much , much better . I thoroughly enjoyed this movie : and I really went for the little doodle bug car .
533315	70535	115927	8.0	very black , dramatic comedy	Fine film about a man who lost his wife , and as a result begins to question the motives of God . He has all these emotional problems while his arrogant brother-in-law is doing fine while totally ignoring any religious commitments ; which the brother-in-law makes his relative very aware of . However , in the end things do not remain the same for arrogant in-law . Nor for the man who lost his wife . This film may bother some Christians at first , but in the end I think this film will be accepted as giving a positive message about theology . The ending was surprising and gratifying .
532633	70535	74906	8.0	Rugged rifleman rides roughshod over unruly rednecks , riles raunchy rancher , riddles rascally rustlers	A gang of horse rustlers take on an ornery rancher causing him to hire a psychotic assassin to terminate his tormentors . Brando was superb as the insane Robert Lee , and Nicholson turned in his usual fine performance as the enigmatic gang leader . Was Robert Lee really a bad man for taking out the thieves , or were the rustlers merely " boys being boys " ? Excellent western with maximum excitement as well as several good laughs .
533318	70535	119349	8.0	intense film about the dissolution of the American family	Spellbinding movie involving the lives of two families and their problems . The parents drank too much , cheated on the spouse , and had little control over the children . Tragedy brought one of the parents out of his lustful fog , but left the feelings of the others up in the air . Good film about the gap between the generations .
533456	70535	110478	8.0	card shark outwits and is outwitted	Extremely well scripted with equally fine acting . Lots of double dealing by card sharks , con men , and charlatans . Funny spoof of the old west .
533451	70535	108358	8.0	good tale about Earp , Holliday , and the Clantons	Fine yarn about the shootout at the Ok Corral . I feel that it was mostly Hollywood's idea of what happened , but who cares . The gunfights were real looking , the bad guys were ' bad ' , and so were some of the good guys . Lots of action in this one ; the show was stolen by Val Kilmer as he played Doc to the hilt .
533226	70535	85334	9.0	Third time to see this one , and I still laugh	There's no finer Christmas tale than this one . It has me rolling in the floor with each viewing . The father stole the show to me , his facial expressions are priceless . Course , the film wouldn't have played without Ralphie . 5 stars .
533400	70535	102753	9.0	sweet , oversexed girl has many adventures	This is told in flashback form . A middle aged man remembers a girl that came to live with his family when he was in his early teens . She was a very nice girl , but highly sexed . At one point she tried to seduce the father , which was the funniest scene in the film . The story of her life with the family , though brief , was interesting and well done . Rose was a free spirited girl that you couldn't help but love . Good show .
533194	70535	102343	9.0	cute show about 2 sweet kids falling in love	I love Sandra Bullock ; she is so cute in this kind of film . She plays an unlovely girl who is unable to make a connection with the opposite sex except as a bed partner . She works with a guy who is exactly like her - a loser . They discover a potion which makes them attractive to others . The show romps through a series of men and women coming on to them after they use the potion . Unfortunately , some rotten folks get their hands on the stuff and use it for their own nasty selves . But , the heroes work hard to stop these nefarious slugs from hatching their evil schemes . Funny and fun movie - 4 stars .
533161	70535	119488	9.0	good cops take on bad cops	This is one of the best films I've ever seen because it was so good . It was based on an old story , but was done differently from all the others . The picture followed 3 policemen as they went about their duties ; one by the book , the other 2 somewhat sordidly . All became involved with a cadre of rogue cops who were using the police force as a cover for criminal behavior . An unforgettable and well choreographed shoot-out capped this excellent movie . 5 stars .
533090	70535	87884	10.0	Jealousy is so wasteful	What a delight : no car chases , explosions , bloody deaths , or computer generated bilge so prevalent today . The bottleneck guitar added a nice flavor to the production , also . Travis wandered alone in the desert in a self made hell because of his own sinful nature . Marrying a much younger woman only fueled his inner demons leading to a mess for his entire family . What a fool . Both he and his wife searched for years for a replacement for something they considered permanently lost only to lead unfulfilled existences on the border of living . I liked the way the story went on and on with no explanations about what caused Travis to trek into the wilds and then sprung it on the viewer in one gut wrenching scene in a Houston cubicle . The dialogue was never boring , but instead concise and well delivered , however , I did have a bit of trouble understanding the German lady's accent . 4 stars .
532670	70535	102685	10.0	break neck speed action film	One of the best action movies made . Great acting , hot story . The pace starts off fast and maintains all the way through . I admit a lot of the feats are totally off the wall , especially the sky diving parts , but who cares ; it was a real cliffhangar style of show . Kept me on the edge of my chair all the way through .
533517	70535	58576	10.0	Great drama that seems like it could happen	This was a fine story with excellent dialogue and performances . Taken from an equally fine book , it came off very realistically . Both the fanatically devoted General and the President presented well thought out and mostly correct objections to each other's philosophies . I felt both were a little bit right and wrong , and would have probably sided with the General except for fear of a military despot . Tense all the way to the end . 5 stars .
