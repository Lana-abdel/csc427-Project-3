543789	562732	84695	1.0	" Wait ! I think I hear someone ! I better go play the piano ? "	The above is not a direct quote , but a quote of the action . At one point , one of the girls is home alone , talking on the phone , and tells the person on the phone that she has to go because she thinks she hears someone . She hangs up the phone and walks immediately over to the piano and starts playing . Now , I normally reserve my votes of for movies that are absolutely incomprehensible on any level . Slumber Party Massacre has a definitely decipherable plot , but the plot is nothing but a flimsy clothesline along which are staged a lot of cheap thrills and boring murder scenes . And , ironically enough , even in the case of a movie that is obviously driven by nudity ( of which the film features remarkably little ) , I don't mean cheap thrills as far as shower scenes or lingerie scenes or any weak trash like that . You have the screeching cat scare , half a dozen or so friends sneaking up on people and viciously grabbing their shoulder from behind or something , only to throw up their hands like , What ? What ? I scared you ? Each successive one making this movie more and more of an endurance test than the weak horror , awful acting , or abysmal script-writing could ever do . And who's the killer ? No one . Some tool in cowboy boots and a lot of denim . Evidently he's an escaped mass murderer who went on a killing spree in the late 60s , which I guess would explain why he appears to be nothing but a middle-aged man with graying hair and a three foot drill . It's like they picked some jerk off the street and said Hey , hold this drill and let us film you running around this locker room for a little while . That should be good enough for this movie . I love all of the attempts to impose some deep women's lib meaning into this movie by commenting on the obviously phallic drill that this jean-jacket-clad maniac chases these women around with . Not that there's anything wrong with the women's liberation movement or implying that a film like this has any meaning in regards to the plight of women , I just think it's really funny to inject meaning into a film as meaningless as this one . ( spoilers ) There's one scene at the end of the film where there is a weak attempt to suggest the insanity of the killer as he mumbles his total of I think 21 spoken words ( not including the gibberish he screams after he gets his hand cut off ) , the first few of which are , " You're all so pretty , " and , shockingly enough , " I love you . " Very cute , it's too bad this sudden moment of character depth comes so far out of left field that it is memorable simply because of its separation with the rest of the film than any meaning it might carry . Joseph Ulibas ( my neighbor right over in Sacramento ) makes an interesting comment that Freud would have loved to psychoanalyze the killer in this movie . Sure , this last scene definitely implies some serious sexual anxiety , as this is apparently a man who gets his thrills by killing pretty women that he loves , but to be perfectly honest , I think Freud would have more of a field day analyzing the writers and , at least as much , whoever it was that read the script and decided that this would be a good movie .
544393	562732	78935	1.0	Ruggero Deodato has truly achieved a milestone new level of depravity and meaningless violence ?	What you have in Cannibal Holocaust is a story about a group of people from NYU that go to document a culture of cannibals and never come back . Not that the story matters . Having watched I think three cannibal movies now ( this is three more than the average healthy adult's lifetime recommended dosage ) , it has become clear to me that they are nothing more than exhibitions of movie violence and sickness . And in that area , the movie succeeds brilliantly . It is so tasteless and so disgusting that it's amazing that things like this ever get made . And not just for the animal mutilations or the feces flinging ( yeah that really happens in this movie . It's not just a t-shirt for smartass teenagers ) or the orgies of misogynistic violence , but of course there are tons of naked natives in the movie , many of them obviously underage . But I guess that is just not a concern in whatever country the movie was distributed from . I am guessing we are meant to be impressed by the feeding scenes , since logic would lead you to believe that that is what a cannibal film centers on . If so , maybe that explains why all the natives must smear their food all over their faces before they eat it , although I am at a loss to explain why women are regularly mutilated , dismembered , fornicated with and THEN eaten . It becomes clear early on that surely someone in the group of NYU people must snap , unable to take what they're seeing anymore , and of course it does happen . One guy , since the natives ' distrust ' them ( maybe it was all that shooting ? ) decides to strip naked to " become like them . " Evidently this man has never seen the whiteness of his naked self before , but the island girls don't seem to mind . As soon as this awkward white guy strips off his khakis a whole group of naked girls run up to him and start grab-assing for a little while . Hey , maybe cannibals aren't so bad after all ? Oh , but minutes later , the group are forced to eat human , as is to be expected . The natives gleefully shove entrails in their faces as they inexplicably turn into savages for the purpose of this bizarre plot . Why the instant and total descent into barbarism ? I have no idea , the movie isn't intelligent enough to explain such a thing , all it knows how to do is show you something that you would be much better off never seeing . A giant turtle is torn apart alive with bare hands while the cameraman zooms in for an extreme close-up so as not to miss a single revolting detail , a monkey gets its face cut off , a backwoods amputation is cauterized with a hot machete and , when the poor amputee immediately dies , the rest of the crew forget seconds later , laughing and joking in the subsequent footage . This is , of course , all documentary footage that they're watching of a past film crew . It seems that these mental giants went into the village and started screaming and shooting their guns and burning the village , and then wondered why they were massacred . It is not exactly a massive intellectual surge when one of the new crew says " these people probably think WE'RE the savages ! " Yeah , what tipped you off ? The burning of their village or the fornicating in the ashes ? Clearly this is meant to be the movie's thinly disguised message . White people are savages at least as much as the people that we think of as savages . Oh and in case you didn't happen to catch that message when it smacked you in the head numerous times like a ton of bricks , at one point the " civilized " people grab one of the native girls and rape her , trying to show her the errors of her ways . Clever . These people are nothing like any manner of civilized people , they are absolute degenerates and should be imprisoned . They even shout for joy when they find a woman impaled on a pole . What the hell is this garbage ? But in watching a movie like this , it seems to me that it is the people that would make and distribute something like this that are the savages . At least horror movies are FUN , even bad ones . And this is not a bad horror movie . It's not a horror movie at all , I don't know what you would call it , but it is truly horrible . A mother gives birth to an infant in the movie , for example . The baby is taken away from it's mother , drenched in blood and then buried in the mud while the mother is beaten to death with rocks . There is a point in the movie where the utterly talentless writer , evidently unaware of how breathtakingly obvious his story is , has one of his characters spoon-feed you the real meaning of the movie : " Today people want sensationalism . The more you rape their senses , the happier they are . " This sentence betrays a staggering lack of understanding of film-going audiences , but at least it is a flawless description of the thought behind the movie . Too bad you have to watch it to learn that you should never have watched it ?
544786	562732	46248	1.0	Yawn .	This is supposed to be one of the greatest " bad " movies ever made . I don't see anything great about it . If ' great ' means that it is appreciable that a film was made that makes a complete mockery of the cinematic medium , then yes , it was wonderful . Everything about this movie was awful . They just did every little thing wrong , and it is understandable to me why the director reportedly attempted suicide after hearing the critics demolish this film when it was released . He had to have expected that , though , don't you think he watched the finished product before releasing it ? How could he have missed the impending annihilation by critics and audiences that he was inevitably going to be subjected to ? ! If you've never seen this film , you're way ahead of the game . If you have seen it , I respectfully offer my condolences .
544692	562732	384533	2.0	Will the real Spike Lee please stand up . . .	So the anti-Bush campaign that makes up the first 45 minutes or so of the movie are pretty clear . Even the attack on Bush's anti-gay tendencies are pretty clear . What's not clear is what the movie's trying to do . Jack is a corporate employee with serious potential who finds himself unemployed because of his refusal to ignore the massive corporate corruption with which he suddenly finds himself surrounded . So then he goes home to his fancy apartment , which he can no longer afford to maintain , and then has to deal with the torturous proposal of impregnating lesbians at $10 , 000 a piece . The most difficult endeavor that the movie takes on is in trying to make us believe that Jack was actually conflicted about all of this , and it fails miserably . There a nonsensical subplot about him still being upset about his ex-girlfriend , the lesbian who is bringing all of her lesbian friends to be impregnated by Jack , but only after her . Keep in mind that their breakup happened FOUR YEARS EARLIER , and not only was he belligerently furious to come home and find his sexy girlfriend having sex with another sexy woman , but he hasn't gotten over it four years later . They actually get into screaming arguments in the movie about this ancient history between themselves . I'm reminded of one of Julia Roberts ' many great lines from Closer ? " What are you , 12 ? " So while he's not busy acting like a junior high school kid who's heartbroken about some girl who cheated on him , he's having sex with whole lines of lesbians and trying to act like it's just hell to him . Please . At the risk of sounding like some typical jerk , for such a thing to be torturous to a man we need to have a real , real good reason for him to hate doing it , and still being upset about a relationship that ended nearly half a decade earlier isn't even close to reason enough . I can accept that the movie wants to suggest that this guy genuinely loved his girlfriend and truly feels like he has lost the love of his life , but let me tell you one thing . Showing a guy suffer through Every Man's Fantasy is not the way to do it . At all . Unless , of course , you have some ulterior political motive , but that's just not Spike Lee's style , right ? Right ? I won't spend much time talking about the ludicrous premise about the lesbians . Whether you've seen the movie or not , you probably already know all about it . The problem is that you also come into the movie already knowing what a socially and politically conscious filmmaker Spike Lee is . We know that he is going to be making political statements in the film , and some of them are clear while others are not , unless Spike has completely lost all sense of balance . There are scenes where it is increasingly obvious what social ills are being dealt with , such as the terrible scene where Jack has some wooden and massively unrealistic conversation with his friend , who is trying to make money donating sperm . It's a god-awful scene , but it's relatively clear what is being said . I could , of course , come up with some pretty solid theories about what is being said about the homosexual content of the film , how Jack the black man is forced to descend to that level , but it is such a gigantic portion of the film that it even overshadows that picture of Bush on the $3 bill at the end of the opening credits , and that's a difficult image to overshadow . Lee puts so much stock into the lesbians in this movie that it borders on low - grade soft porn . At one point in the movie , while bike riding together , Jack's brother gives him a bright , sparkling gem of advice ? get a vasectomy and call it a day . Now , there are two things that could lead a man to give such advice to his brother . First , it could be because he's been having too much sex , or second , it could be because he's making ten thousand dollars at a time doing it . Either way , it's a good reason never to take advice from your brother again . Jack , of course , reacts by throwing a temper tantrum like an 8 year old kid , resulting in one of the great many scenes that made me want to put a pot over my head and start beating on it with a serving ladle . One of the biggest problems with the movie is that not only does it bore and irritate but it deliberately insults the audience . Granted , I didn't know a lot of the details about some of the homages that are made in the film , such as the XFL player that inspired the title of the film and the security guard who exposed the Watergate break-in and ruined his own life in the process . I can understand if Lee wants us to be aware of what he's talking about , but he literally stops his movie to put these stories up on billboards and then hits us over the head with them . By the end of the movie I was literally standing up , pacing back and forth I was so irritated and desperate for it to end . There are times when I wish I didn't have this determination to finish watching movies , even the abysmally terrible ones . The really sad thing about She Hate Me is that it isn't even not very good for a Spike Lee film , this is just a bad movie overall . It's almost weird to think that it was directed by the same man that directed true classics like Do The Right Thing , one of my all time favorite films . She Hate Me is Spike Lee's version of Spielberg's 1941 , but worse . Much worse .
544916	562732	68282	2.0	You would think that a women in prison movie would be an automatic disaster ?	And you'd be right . Black Mama , White Mama , also known as ' Women in Chains , ' is exactly the kind of trashy and crappy b-movie that the premise suggests . Pam Grier has been thrown into a prison on a small island with a lot of other women , and this place seriously makes the summer camp where Martha Stewart is locked up right now look like a maximum-security prison . It's not five minutes into the movie that one of the hottie guards utters the line ' Strip ' em and get ' em wet , ' and then we are introduced to a prison life that resembles some college freshman's fantasy of what the inside of a sorority house is like . The prisoners soap and rub and wrestle with each other in the shower like it's a Girls Gone Wild shoot , then they all hang out together in their dorm , openly smoking pot and discussing in a big group what would be the best ways to escape . I've never been to prison myself , but I have a feeling that escape plans are the kind of thing that you want as few people as possible to know about , prisoners or guards or otherwise . The biggest difference between this prison life and some fantasy sorority life is that the women in this movie all wear orange cardigans ( and no pants . Go figure ) that say PRISON on the back . Must be those generic prison outfits for prisons that can't afford pricey accessories like their prison name or prisoner numbers for their uniforms . And as is to be expected , a prison that can't afford to put prisoner identification on the backs of the uniforms can obviously not expect to be able to find guards that are interested in guarding the prisoners as much as they are in having sex with the prisoners and each other . The conflict of the movie's title refers to the fact that Lee Daniels ( Pam Grier ) spends much of the time handcuffed to a blonde prisoner named Karen as they are on the run from the cops after escaping from the prison . I won't go into details about how they escape except to say that you might have seen something like it in The Fugitive had they been unable to afford to stage a train wreck , and it leads into the muddled story of the conflicting interests also chasing these two women for different reasons . Karen and Lee both have their own gangs of people each hoping to rescue their respective escaped prisoner , and the cops are after both of them all the while . ( spoilers ) So Karen is involved with a bunch of hippies that want to Revolutionize Life As They Know It . Meanwhile , Karen just wants to get off the island , something she's been trying to do for years , and isn't it just perfect that they each need to go to completely opposite sides of the island in order to fulfill their goals . So we get this odd couple pairing and , since they are an odd couple , it's not hard to predict that they will hate each other for the vast majority of the film but grow fond of each other by the end . In a movie with so many conflicting interests , especially when those conflicting interests not only propel the two main characters in opposite directions as they pursue their goals , it is not unreasonable to expect that there will be a climactic moment involving the rival gangs at some point in the movie . Not about to leave anyone unsatisfied , they throw in a stupid gang standoff at the end of the movie , where everyone shoots machine guns at each other , killing each other en masse while the two women paddle safely and calmly across the river in a little boat . Nice . Even better , at the end of the movie , after a huge massacre in which lots of people get shot and spurt bright red paint all over the place , the Captain of the police looks over the masses of dead criminals covered in awful , awful special effects , and we learn that he will be a Major before dinner . Not a bad way to end the movie , the criminals all kill each other off and the cops get all the credit , but here is the last line in the film ? ' It's better to win , isn't it ? ' Is THAT why the Captain is going to get promoted to Major ? Because he figured that out ? ? ?
544799	562732	988849	2.0	# 1 Movie To Avoid This Week ( . . . and every week ) . . .	Holy crap . It's not often that a movie comes along that is so morally vacuous that it approaches a level of violent stupidity so intricately bad that it is absolutely not enjoyable on any level . But when it does happen , and it has happened with this movie , it makes my job seem incredibly difficult because I have to sit here and try to write a professional film review when I know without a shadow of a doubt that three simple words would suffice - DON'T WATCH IT . But if you would like to know why , please continue reading . First of all , let's brainstorm about what makes a violent thriller entertaining , shall we ? You need to have an engaging story , something that moves at a brisk pace and maintains interest without relying on the violence to push it along . You need to have not only believable characters but characters that we care enough about to invest our emotions in their well - being , and you need to have a catalyst operating beneath the surface that drives the characters on screen to commit whatever violent acts take place in the movie . Donkey Punch has none of these . Not even a little bit . There is , of course , a lot to be said about violence in the movies . Some say there's too much , some say movies are movies and no movie violence is going to change who people are or entice people to commit violent acts , and some people are just violent movie-hounds and can never get enough . Whatever your personal opinion , I tend to think that we can all agree that at the very least , movie violence should have a point , right ? Not this movie . Donkey Punch gives us a film populated with morons , perverts , rapists and idiot college girls , not a single character worth a scrap of thought or interest , and then asks us to care when they start killing each other off . A group of college-girls meet a group of college-age guys at a European resort and , hungry for some adventure stories to take home from their European vacation , immediately accept a shady offer to come touring the Mediterranean Sea on a luxurious yacht to which one of them happens to have access . Anyone with two brain cells working at the same time would have hesitated for at least a few seconds before accepting such an offer from a bunch of crusty guys like these , but no matter . If nothing else , the immediacy of the acceptance will pretty quickly and thoroughly paint the picture of what the rest of the movie is going to be like . Everyone wants to have sex with everyone else , and while taking turns with the blonde not far into the movie in a drug-crazed orgy , when one guy convinces another guy to try out a little sex move called the " donkey punch . " I won't waste your time explaining what it is . It doesn't matter , it's just a plot device needed to supply the cast with a dead body so that they can spend the rest of the movie killing each other off as they struggle to figure out who can be trusted and who should just be killed . There is not a scrap of realism in the movie , not an iota of clever dialogue or impressive acting , and the by-the-numbers ending does nothing to boost the mood of genuine depression that permeates the entire movie . This thing is a waste in pretty much every way imaginable . Avoid it .
544561	562732	89173	2.0	The worst one yet .	Contains Spoilers ! The movie starts out with a nightmare that Tommy Jarvis is having . You remember Tommy , played by Corey Feldman in Part 4 , evidently he's grown up to a fabulous future as a mental patient . Thankfully , this was a dream , since it features two nutcases whooping and hollering as they dig Jason out of his grave , where he is buried under about 3-4 inches of soft dirt , and apparently buried wearing his hockey mask and with a stabbing weapon in each hand . Brilliant . Tommy awakens on the way to the mental hospital , around which most of the rest of the movies revolves . In the movie's defense , at least it wasn't yet another slopfest about a lot of teenagers going up to the lake to be rebellious and end up getting killed just like we already knew they would . They are running out of inventive ways to cut up young people for that to drive yet another Friday the 13th installment . Unfortunately , they seem to have decided that since they added a few new gimmicks to the movies , like a mental hospital , a Jason impersonator , and some shockingly dirty rednecks , they didn't need to come up with any new death scenes . Not exactly the most intellectual necessity , but creative deaths are about 85 % of what has always driven this series , and in this one we get more of the same boring killings - a machete pushed through the stomach ( on two separate occasions in this movie , I think ) , slashes across the chest / face , etc . In one scene , Jason plunges a pair on hedge-clippers through some poor girls eyes , but then they screwed it up because we get a shot upwards of his hands holding the clippers and roughly pushing them together , indicating that he had beheaded her . Then we see her and she was just stabbed through the eyes . Why include that shot if it's completely wrong as far as what he did to her ? At any rate , the nutty people who inform the cast that they're all doomed are rather interesting as the above-mentioned dirty rednecks , except they run up to the cast when they're at the mental hospital surrounded by police ( to find out why you have to watch the movie yourself ) , and they run up screaming threats , upset that there is a mental hospital filled with punk teenagers so close to their home . Pretty funny scene , except the woman threatens to kill the next person who comes near their house , then she expands her threat to include the police officers , then she informs the lot of them that she is currently strapped with dynamite and would blow them all to hell if they don't watch their step . Just so you know , if you threaten to even punch someone and there is a police officer within earshot , consider yourself arrested . A verbal threat is assault , and can land you in jail . This woman threatened to kill the kids , the police officer , and then to blow herself up , killing everyone in sight , and the cops just smile as she jumps on the motorcycle with her nutcase son and rides off with him , taking with her the dynamite and any respect I might have had for these cops . Later on , we see these rednecks at home as she is chopping up a chicken , screeching all the while , to feed to her idiot son , and they are approached by a man who knocks on the door , asking if they have any work he can do for some food ( he hasn't eaten in two days ) , so she puts him to work cleaning out the chicken coop and then he can come back and get his stomach filled . Why was this guy in the movie at all ? He literally serves absolutely no purpose other than to inform the audience that these people have a chicken coop that needs cleaning and so that he can be another person for Jason to kill . If they didn't think they had a large enough cast of teenagers for Jason to plow through , I would have suggested just adding a few more characters rather than adding in some wandering oddball in a wife-beater looking for a meal . Instead we have this guy with no part in the movie except that of a hungry victim . ( spoilers ) One of the two most ridiculous scenes in the film concerns her son , who gets beat up down at the mental hospital by Tommy , so he rides home on his motorcycle , screaming that those damn kids made him mad . Rather than going inside to express his anger to his mother , this ridiculous moron rides around the yard on his bike , spinning doughnuts and doing wheelies and screaming at the top of his lungs all the while , flying recklessly around the yard until he either slams into a tree , killing himself , or gets beheaded by a butcher knife that pops out of the bushes . We get the latter , but either would have been satisfying enough , as long as it shut that idiot up . The second of the two most ridiculous scenes in the film is the one where Demon , the older brother of one of the younger but more prominent characters in the movie , takes turns singing ' Hey baby baby ' over and over to his girlfriend on the other side of the craphouse wall . VERY romantic . On the other hand , what the hell else would you expect from someone with a name like Demon ? I guess this was the only thing they could come up with I order to make Demon get concerned when his girlfriend stopped singing back to him . His death , however , was among the more interesting of all of the ones in the movie . Thus brings up a rather important plot point about this movie , that the killer in the hockey mask is not even Jason , but Jason being impersonated by someone , whose identity and motives are revealed at the end of the film after his pretty impressive death scene . Fans might be disappointed that it's not even Jason in this movie , since he was killed in Part 4 , but that doesn't really matter for the most part , because even though it's really just some guy doing all the killing , he is still just as relentless , stolid , and basically impervious to damage as the original . He makes no sounds , doesn't run , and of course can't be killed until enough people have been killed to fulfill an hour and a half running time . This should have opened up a lot of possibilities for the movie , since the last time there was any element of mystery was in Part 1 when the real killer was not Jason Voorhees but his mother , seeking revenge against the kids who brought about the death of her son . But nope , the only mystery is that the killer is not really Jason , who the films makers decided to leave dead for this installment ( viewers at the time of its release were probably expected to expect some sort of ' Evil Never Dies ' resurrection very soon to follow ) , but the ham-handed hints leave all but the most dense viewers very aware of the killer's real identity long before his mask ever comes off . This is surely one of the most hated of the Friday installments among the series ' fans , most likely because the real Jason does not appear , but only in name , almost . For the entire film except for the scenes that hint at the killer's identity and the scene where his mask comes off at the end , he is the real Jason . He acts and moves exactly like him , so the basic attraction of the movie is there , I suppose , but it reminds me of the popular failure of Halloween III , the one which completely departed from the premise of the first two films , having absolutely nothing to do with Michael Meyers or Laurie Strode . They wisely returned to the original story in part IV , even going so far as to attach the subtitle ' The Return of Michael Meyers ' and put a big picture of his mask on the movie's poster . The next Friday film does exactly the same thing , adding on the subtitle ' Jason lives , ' as though to say , ' Sorry about that last movie ! He's alive in this one ! ' I love the subtlety of these movies . So this movie is probably considered by many people , such as myself , to be the worst installment in the series , but not only because it wasn't really Jason as the killer . That's probably only about 90 % of the reason . The other 10 % is things like the ones mentioned above . Logic is abandoned even more than in the other movies ( Tommy , for example , is admitted to a mental hospital that not only exists in the exact location of the cause of his mental instability , but also allows him to keep such things as the horror movie masks that he made as a kid and , shockingly enough , a four-inch pocket-knife ) , a guy is introduced who has no part in the movie or the series other than to get killed , etc . But I think it remains a curiosity piece , in that it is so clearly an experiment by the filmmakers to try something a little different , have it fail miserably , and then promptly return to the general formula in the next movie .
543945	562732	96118	3.0	" I'm completely cured ! If I wasn't they wouldn't have let me out ! "	So Angela has grown up and gotten therapy and an operation to turn her into a real life daughter , rather than the son that she was born , and now holds a job as - wait for it - a camp counselor ! How appropriate , right ? I know , I love it . Anyway , the first sequel to the Sleepaway Camp franchise obeys all the rules of horror sequels - more blood , more imaginative killings ( which aren't imaginative , but still more so than the original ) , more nudity , a more elaborate plot , and generally worse than the original . It is entertaining in the same way as the original was , in that the characters and wardrobes are so goofy and so authentically 80's that you can't help getting a good laugh . At one point , a guy asks Angela out , and she says " I'll call you , " and then quickly walks away . The guy says to himself , " How is she gonna call me ? I don't have a phone ! " and then he sniffs his armpits , wondering what turned her off ( it's the hair , dude ! ! ) . It is a well-known fact that in 80s slasher movies , the murdered teenagers were more often than not being punished by their killer for some kind of bad behavior , usually for being too promiscuous . When I first started getting into horror movies and saw the Friday the 13th movies for the first time in the mid 90s , I didn't realize this . I learned it in a film class a year or two later and was amazed that their was some method to the madness . I was pretty impressed , not only that the movies were passing on some kind of message , albeit a morbid one , but that there was actually some thought put into it . But not in this movie ! At one point just before Angela kills one of her victims , she says " Let this be a lesson to you . Say no to drugs ! " Real subtle screen writing there , guys . Then again , the dialogue is the most entertaining thing in the movie . Angela ( who , by the way , went through all that therapy and those operations and all that trouble to clean up her past and reinvent herself as a normal and well-developed person and then changed her name from Angela to , umm , Angela ) , says at one point , " I don't like being the wicked witch of the west , but I know what happens when things get out of control . " ( People start getting killed . . . by me ! HA ! ) Then later , she demands that one of the counselors , Mare , make an apology , to which the girl replies , " I'd rather die ! " Sorry , Mare , but you really walked into that one . . . Two years ago I was a camp counselor at a sleepaway camp similar to the one portrayed in this movie ( except the camp that I taught at had more than three kids to the 15 or 20 counselors and it also had rules , which the one in the movie doesn't ) . This made me notice the myriad of discrepancies in the movie from what camp life is really like . That's okay though , you can hardly make a movie like this with a lot of 9 year olds running around , although there were some 10 or 11 year old kids killed in this movie . I hadn't seen that kind of thing much before . Definitely bad taste , even for a cheesy 80s slasher movie . . . .
543930	562732	1185834	3.0	Taking this stuff seriously anymore , George Lucas isn't . . .	Okay , so Star Wars is now officially a kid's movie . George Lucas ' newest cash-in on the Star Wars saga is a wholly unnecessary cartoon which caters to a much younger audience , but one that will find the majority of the story entirely incomprehensible . The Star Wars films made a sharp turn to the digital realm starting with the release of The Phantom Menace in 1999 , and they now have made the full transition to being fully animated . And by the way , I noticed that The Clone Wars is being advertised as the " first " fully animated Star Wars film . If they go nuts with the sequels , I sure hope they get better ! The story takes place between Episode II and Episode III . The Republic is at war with the Separatists and its access to the Galactic Rim is being threatened . Complicating the problem is that diplomatic relationships are strained to the extreme because Jabba the Hutt's son ( yes , he has a son now ) has been kidnapped , and due to some carefully orchestrated misinformation , he suspects the Jedi . Confused yet ? Imagine how the kids feel ! But it doesn't matter because everything else in the movie is there just for them . There's a cutesy little teenie bopper apprentice named Ashoka assigned to tag along with Anakin and learn all she can from him about the Jedi ways . Lending her voice to the character is Ashley Eckstein , who , get this , is probably best known as Muffy from " That's So Raven . " What the hell is happening here ? That's So Raven ? ! I have no problem with child stars moving on from their kiddie roles and into more serious acting , but the problem is that Eckstein takes that step in The Clone Wars , but doesn't do anything different . Her character is like a little kid running around through a story that is attempting to be a Star Wars movie , but it can't because she keeps re-naming things and people ( Skyguy ? ? ) , and ( barring the occasional bout of astonishing light saber moves and tricks with using ' The Force ' ) generally behaving as if she's still acting in a show made for girls under age 10 . For example , most of her role in the movie is not as a Jedi apprentice , but a babysitter of Jabba's offspring , the " Huttlet , " as he is affectionately called throughout the movie . A few years ago I saw a documentary about the history of the adult film industry , in which Ron Jeremy presented his hairy , pot-bellied self as proof that any guy in the world can get laid . Now , it seems that more recent evidence of this theory has come to light . Jabba the Hutt , in all his slithery , gelatinous glory , has managed to seduce himself a ' Hottie the Hutt ' and partake in that great wonder of procreation . It's strange to consider that if ' Mama the Hutt ' had been included in the movie , it probably would have made the entire film a complete joke . But not to let an opportunity to slip something asinine into the movie , Jabba refers to his beloved son ( during a serious negotiation meeting ) through a translator as his " little punkey muffin . " But fear not , the Huttlet is more than enough of a spectacle . He looks like a sperm the size and color of a watermelon with orange eyes and a mouth . Punkey muffin , indeed . And therein lies the problem with the entire movie . Everything in it is a stupid joke , like Lucas is just laughing at himself and the world he created . It's all just a story to him now and he's just goofing off . Here's a sample of dialogue between two of his idiot droids during a heated battle : Droid # 1 : " Concentrate fire on sector 11374465 ! " Droid # 2 : " Uh , 117 , um , 3 uh . . what ? " Droid # 1 : " Just shoot right there ! " I had been under the impression that droids were manufactured and therefore programmed . Do you mean to tell me that they are equipped with vague understandings of their battle commands and shoddy short term memories ? That's just poor planning ! But sadly , this interaction is representative of the rest of the movie . All serious story-telling is sacrificed for dumb laughs . Little effort is put into doing anything interesting with the animation , which isn't even very impressive , and the real Star Wars story is a distant backdrop to this goofy babysitting / kidnapping story about Jabba's babbling son . Oh and one more thing . The final nail in the coffin of The Clone Wars is Jabba the Hutt's uncle who , judging mostly by his voice , can only be described as a gay black nightclub owner with phosphorescent blacklight tattoos all over his purple body . What the hell ? ! I was unimpressed with The Phantom Menace when it was released almost ten years ago , but it was still a serious installment in the Star Wars series . The Clone Wars , on the other hand , never takes itself seriously , and is too obviously an advertisement for the television series and , possibly even more , the inevitable video game . Most of the battle sequences are so video game-like that my thumbs started twitching for want of a controller . Skip this one . Go see Tropic Thunder or Pineapple Express instead .
543771	562732	107969	3.0	One of the weakest action thrillers I've seen in years .	Rising Sun is an exercise in bad screenwriting . It presents a story about big bad Japanese businessmen / gangsters and the crooked sale of a massive corporation called Microcon . The movie starts off with a goofball karaoke scene where Eddie Sakamura , the lead bad guy in another absolutely awful performance by Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa , singing a country song called Don't Fence Me In , in a scene that's probably one of the most pathetic attempts to develop a three dimensional character in cinematic history . Ted Danson ' Peter Lowenstein in Body Heat ( 1981 ) was three dimensional because he had an interest in dancing that went beyond his character's obligatory role in the film . Here , this scene is thrown in at random just so we can try to pretend that this is a real person and not the facelss , stereotypical bad guy that we see for the rest of the film . Just after this terrible scene ends , we are taken to the meeting about the sale of Microcon , and the movie again trips over itself by trying in pathetic vain to create suspense during nearly silent deliberations over this sale in a conference room , and if you manage to stay awake long enough , a seedy murder soon follows , the solution of which the rest of the movies tries to present . The worst of the screenplay writing comes in about when Sean Connery's John Connor ( real creative name , guys ) is introduced , and continues pretty much until the end of the film . Welsey Snipes embarrasses himself by taking on a role in which he serves no other purpose than to be Wesley Snipes so that his name can go on the cover of the movie and trick action fans into thinking this might be another fast paced Snipes film ( he's not the best action hero in the world , but he has certainly come out with better stuff than THIS ) , and to stand around and ask questions like a confused child . From the moment that Connor comes into the story , just about every time any character says anything , it is immediately followed by another character explaining what the hell is going on . There are two lengthy scenes that come almost one right after another where Web Smith ( Snipes ) and Connor are driving in the car , and Connor is explaining what is going on to the baffled Smith . LAPD nothing , this guy is more clueless than a dropout from Right Hand Roger's 24 Hour Junior Police Academy . The plot continues to jump through clichéd thriller hoops , with Connor all the while wowing Smith with his tactics and vainly trying to wow the audience as well , but it is somehow very difficult to be entertained by a movie that spends the majority of its running time explaining itself , and sometimes even badly . There is a scene early in the film at the murder investigation where Connor steps into the conversation ( because Smith , as he predicted , got himself into trouble ) and makes an unpredictable move , and then later when he's explaining to Smith what just happened , he ends by saying , ' Now Mr . Yoshida owes me a favor ? Deep , isn't it ! ' Well , since you asked , no , it's not deep . Not even a little bit . And neither is the rest of the movie .
544611	562732	77945	4.0	There's snakes out there this big ? ?	Mountain of the Cannibal God immediately strikes me as almost exactly the same thing as Last Cannibal World with a slightly bigger budget . It seems that the cannibal sub-genre is pretty limited as far as what kinds of things you can do with the story , so I kept my expectations low . Ursula Andress stars as the grieving wife of a man lost in the mysterious jungle , and she is determined to go in after him , although her intentions aren't exactly what they seem to be . I love it when they first enter the jungle , one of the guys says " Don't say a word to anyone , we don't want the police on our tail ! " Yeah , if you're ever going into a cannibal-infested jungle , make sure not to tell anyone where you're going . It would be awful if anyone were able to find you ! The tribe we meet in this installment is the same as the last cannibals , although their animal-like qualities are not quite as blown out of proportion . They are highly barbaric and undeveloped , of course , but this time instead of being too animal-like , they have a genuinely bizarre religion , although ancient religions are not always known for their conduciveness to modern logic . At one point they make a sacrifice for having killed a tarantula , but even more bizarre , when it is revealed that they have turned Susan's ( Andress ) husband into a god by pinning his rotting corpse on some kind of rack , it seems that one of the ways that they worship him is to wipe the pus and mucus from his decaying face and rub it on their own face . Nice . Stacey Keach also shows up in an early role long before his outstanding work in American History X , although he isn't given anything memorable to do here . He eventually reveals that his entire goal of going into the jungle is to find this tribe and destroy them so he can sleep peacefully , I guess . He has the obligatory role of the modern man forced to participate in the cannibalism , and it is properly disgusting . There is a rafting scene near the end of the film that is botched in the way that most b-movies botch something like sky-diving . It is so unrealistic and so campy that it is genuinely amusing . The editing , as well , is unbelievably cheap , like the rest of the movie . But as a cannibal film , this is about what you can expect . Horror fans should be entertained . It's not a classic , but it's a passable sample of its sub-genre .
544778	562732	130623	4.0	Is this a kid's movie ?	Dinosaur is not even a breakthrough in computer generated effects for Disney . That title is reserved for the spectacular hit Toy Story . What you have in Dinosaur is basically a re-make of The Land Before Time , with the cell animation replaced with computer generated images . The story is so unoriginal that the end result could be referred to simply as " yet another Disney movie . " However , this time the normally ingenius Disney product seems to be alienating its biggest target audience , the younger viewers . They tried to make this movie TOO real , and in making an animated film about nature and using extremely realistic special effects , it is to be expected that the violence can be a little excessive . I'm not saying that the violence is glorified , I'm just saying that in a movie like this it is not a good idea to show some of the things that were seen in Dinosaur . I saw mothers taking their kids out of the theater during the film because of its violent content . I was bored with Dinosaur from the beginning . As soon as I found out that all of the dinosaurs were given cute little voices , I knew that I would be disappointed with the film , and I was . The " Disney effect " simply did not work with a serious Dinosaur story the way that it worked in The Land Before Time , and because they tried to combine two completely different elements like that , the film fell flat . The all powerful Disney corporation has indeed produced a flop .
543774	562732	107009	4.0	A movie about the sinister possibilities of the young internet .	Ghost In The Machine is one of those movies that comes out with the emergence of some new technology and how it can go wrong . Computers were still in the major developing stages in the early 1990s ( at least compared to today's standards ) , as was the Internet , and Ghost In The Machine seems to be a false start on getting a handle on turning the new technology into a horror movie or suspense thriller . The problem is that the writers of the movie were apparently so anxious to get the film written and filmed and released that they didn't take the time to put any thought into it . The technical production of the film is not entirely a pathetic mess , even though it does assume that electronics come equipped with little windows through which can be seen the shining faces of people at their computers , and that electrical outlets with tape over them will display a blinking red ACCESS DENIED sign if you attempt to get through them , but even the most cartoonish computer animated scenes that took us on a roller coaster ride through our microwave ovens were at least mildly interesting , although not at all convincing . In this case , we are looking more at the technique than the content , the way you watch an abstract relaxation video . The problem here is that the movie tells the story of how a serial killer steals peoples address books and then kills the people listed in them , but a reason for these killings is never even suggested . The closest we come to having a reason for why this guy is so eager to commit all of these brutal killings is during an early scene when he is driving home from his job at the computer shop , and in recklessly trying to pass a slow moving truck he swerves into oncoming traffic only to jerk the wheel to the left and go skidding down a steep hill upside down in his car , laughing all the way , HA HA HA ! So the guy is completely insane . That's a reason , I guess , but probably the most uncreative one imaginable and therefore one of the least interesting ones possible . The whole idea of the killer going into electricity in general is obviously the most unrealistic thing in the entire film , but it is stretched to cover almost the entire movie from beginning to end , which is what shows most clearly the fact that the movie is based on the emergence of the world wide web . It's kind of a what-if thriller about what would happen if a psychotic killer was accidentally released into the electricity based communications system that is the internet and was then able to defy all laws of logic and physics and who knows what else , and if he had somehow developed this overwhelming passion to kill a certain woman and her family and friends for committing the crime of leaving her address book at the computer shop . The movie makes a good solid effort to be a worthwhile thriller , but for the most part it falls completely flat .
543937	562732	397065	4.0	" Pinch this tiny heart of mine , wrap it in up soiled twine , you never read what you've written ? "	As has become the standard for modern horror films , this sub-par House of Wax remake ( as I call it having yet to see the original ) begins with an introduction of a meaningless group of stupid college-age kids , and then promptly allows us to get to know them just enough to ensure that they are all thoroughly unlikable . I'm not sure why so much effort was put into making them all into such distasteful characters , but my current theory is that it is simply a misguided attempt to keep some element of mystery in the movie , since you already know they'll be killed off one by one . In the movie's defense , a good story involves good character change , and it cannot be denied that there is plenty of that here , it's just too bad that's not all there is . I'm reminded of the ridiculous horror film Wrong Turn , which featured an equally meaningless group of college-age kids getting lost in the woods and being confronted by some clownishly made-up in-bred rednecks who gleefully off all of the unfortunate kids stuck in the big bad woods . That and Texas Chainsaw III , but I digress . As I am led to believe was also the case , to a certain extent , at least , in the original film , the remake concerns a deserted town in which there can be found a wax museum whose feature displays are so realistic because there are real people beneath the wax coating , presumably embalmed in the wax yet slowly rotting away . The biggest advance that this film makes is in some truly revolting scenes , such as a scene where one of the kids is made into a wax sculpture and his friend tries to free him , only peeling the skin off his face as he tries to get the wax off of him . On the other hand , there are also some thoroughly botched scenes , like the one where a girl gets the tip of her finger cut off and it bubbles over with blood like a fountain . Tom Savini , who was doing better gore effects than this two and a half decades ago , would be appalled . Remember in House of the Dead when those kids went to that island for the rave of the century , found it completely deserted , and didn't really seem to be bothered ? It's kind of the same here , they take a detour on their way to a big football game get lost on a detour and decide to camp in the scary , smelly , creepy woods . They smell the smell of decaying flesh , and a pickup truck pulls up and shines its brights at them , no one getting out or responding when they call to them . Nick , the biggest jerk of the lot already , hauls off and throws a bottle at the truck , smashing one of the headlights . Let me tell you something , you do not get away with that in the country . The driver doesn't even have to be a crazed killer to jump out and knock your block off . Instead , the truck ominously drives away , leaving the kids convinced that the situation is under control , so they settle down for the night . After later running into the guy in the pickup truck as he dumps dead animals onto a massive pile of rotting dead animals ( hence the smell of the woods ) , they smartly decide to hitch a ride with him to town to buy a fanbelt to replace the one that snapped in their truck while it was parked the night before . The town they get a ride to turns out to be a forgotten relic of the 1960s , which " doesn't even show up on the GPS but is remarkably maintained . No one's walking around the town but there are plenty of people at the funeral home , including one man , incredulous that they would interrupt his grandmother's funeral but who soon recovers and agrees to offer them what turns out to be a lot of waxy help . After this point , the movie runs parallel to countless other movies college kids get lost in the woods , one gets kidnapped , and the rest get killed one by one . At the moment I'm thinking of Texas Chainsaw 4 , by far the worst of them all , including the ludicrous 2003 remake . You'll yawn through the rest of the film , if you haven't yawned through it so far , although there are some impressive special effects with the wax , some I've mentioned already , including an obviously CG but still interesting climax , which describes the fate of the House of Wax . Essentially , it's just another bad slasher movie from the 1980s , but with Paris Hilton and , the one thing that has caused horror films to lose their souls , computer generated special effects . This is certainly not the worst modern horror movie you could watch , I'm mentioned in this review some that are at least as bad and some far worse ( like House of the Dead ) , it's just so tiring to see yet another one come out with so little thought or effort put into it .
544855	562732	69332	4.0	Sample dialogue : ' You'd give all this up ? 8-track stereo , color TV in every room ? it's the American dream ! '	First you have to get over how catastrophically obsolete this film is , and then it might be enjoyable on some deep , subconscious level . Having watched it and learned that it was one of the most controversial blaxploitation films of the 70s , I am a little hesitant to write a scathing review of it , since I'm sure it has some sort of cult following somewhere , but the movie is so badly made and so goofy that it's almost impossible to praise it . I was also shocked to read one IMDb reviewer call the soundtrack one of the greatest in film history . Way off , buddy , but I am willing to admit that at one point , presumably early 1970s , this kind of music was considered great , but today it is so preposterous that it's almost weird . And by the way , I'd like to once again protest the word blaxploitation , an utterly meaningless description used to describe something which strikes me as something similar to those FUBU clothes , or rap music . By black people , for black people , so who they're exploiting and for whom is beyond me . Being mostly white myself , I'm outside the target audience , but I decided to watch it because I think that ancient styles are so funny . See the teenagers in 80s teen comedies or horror movies , for instance . Speaking of ancient styles , it's interesting to notice how much the typical audience has evolved over the years since Super Fly was made . A director today , for example , could never get away with making a movie like this , modern audiences just don't have the attention span . The movie moves along like a series of music videos , stopping periodically to insert some dialogue and characters and situations , after which it moves back into another music video . Even that sex scene in the bathtub seemed to go on forever , panning up and down and up and down and up and down the naked bodies in the tub , presumably long enough for the song to play out before we can move on to the next scene . From a technical standpoint , the film is an absolute disaster . There's a foot-chase early in the movie during which a wire of some sort falls directly in front of the camera lens not once , but twice , the audio is numerous scenes does not even remotely match the video ( the never-ending bathtub scene , for example ) , and the acting is abysmal . ( spoilers ) The story is about a drug dealer who wants to do the One Last Gig And Then Get Out For Good , and runs into all kinds of obstacles along the way . All of which , of course , are obstacles just long enough to create some periodic dialogue scenes and then become solved when it's time for the plot to move along . The ending has something of a twist , I suppose , although that may be because I was envisioning a bit of a tragic ending because of the way things were leading , but the movie as a whole is a tired , plodding exercise through the jive of the streets of the big city in the early 1970s , with lots of badass blacks and evil white cops screwing everything up . I don't like the way the black people were portrayed in the film , as far as being dedicated dope smugglers and cocaine dealers and whatnot , but I still don't think that the term blaxploitation is appropriate , because you have to admit that Priest's intentions were honorable . Sure , he had been leading a less than honorable life and had less than honorable means for getting out of it , but the important thing is that he wanted to get out , he wanted to change his life for the better . I think the only way that blaxploitation can be used to accurately describe movies like this is in the way stereotypes are used as a starting point for the story . Lots of black criminals , basically . I've heard that Denzel Washington has talked about doing a remake of this movie with the director of Training Day . Given how far Denzel has fallen in his acting career because he keeps making the same movie over and over , it seems that he doesn't care as much about where his career goes from now on . Surely he has more than enough money to last the rest of his life , but why would he want to do something as crazy as that ? Did he not see the train wreck that was Samuel L . Jackson's remake of Shaft ?
543769	562732	280590	4.0	Mr . Deeds , in my opinion , marks a point in Adam Sandler's career where it seems that the majority of the thinking audience will , if they haven't already , begin to wonder whether Sandler will ever do anything	SPOILERS SPOILERS The new name for the character that Sandler plays in every movie is , in this case , Mr . Deeds , a small town man who learns that he is the inheritor of a massive fortune from a distant relative who is a media mogul . Deeds lives in the tiny town of Mandrake Falls , New Hampshire , where he is constantly the talk of the entire town , the borders of which do not seem to extend very far past the doors of the pizzeria that he owns . He comes to New York to see what all the financial fuss is about , and as all his friends at home watch him on TV , he proceeds to try to take part in the company rather than taking his inheritance and going back into obscurity where he clearly belongs . ( spoilers ) The fortune is , first of all , ridiculously exaggerated . There is no one in the target audience of this film ( nor , really , many people at all in the world ) who can really visualize how much money $40 billion exactly is . That's not even money , as James Caan said in The Way of the Gun ( where he speaks about $50 million , I believe ) , it's a new life . Money is what you get out of the ATM , it's what you take to the grocery store . $40 billion is so astronomical that they may as well have just said that Deeds has inherited all the money in the world . On the other hand , while I thought that the film had a positive message against greed and corruption , the fact that Deeds turned down the inheritance ( simply saying that he doesn't want that money ) could not have been more poorly executed . First of all , when he decides that he just doesn't want it , if you listen you can hear everyone in the audience slapping their foreheads almost as hard as when Mox pulled that ' oh-I-just-can't ' crap during the whipped cream bikini scene in Varsity Blues . Second , while it was nice to see that Deeds decides to donate the money to charity instead of accepting more money than any single human being could spend in 20 lifetimes with wide-eyed glee , this part of the film was probably the least creative thing in the entire movie , which wasn't very creative to begin with . I can imagine the writers of the movie writing this scene at the end of the day or right before their lunch hour , just because it's so obvious that it was slapped together . When Deeds asked the name of that one charity , you know , that one . . Yeah , give it to those guys . You can just picture the writers already half out of their chairs and on their way out of the room when someone says wait , what does he do with the money , and they say much the same thing that he says in the movie . You can almost see the indifferent wave of the hand and maybe something like , ' Oh , just have him give it to some charity . ' This reminds me of Hollow Man , which is a film that had nearly endless possibilities , which were all completely ignored in favor of a simplistic and clichéd plot . I know it may seem like I'm making a big deal about something that's kind of trivial , but it's really not . There could be a lot of meaning delivered in who he gives the money to , and it could have been a lot of fun , too . Even something as simple as what Rudy Duncan ( Ben Affleck ) did with all the money at the end of Reindeer Games ( 2000 ) was more creative and more fun than this . The whole plot involving Winona Ryder's character ( charmingly named ' Babe ' ) was crude and tacked on . While it was interesting that she played a character who tried to skewer Deeds to get a good news story ( albeit a heavily dramatized and altered one ) , the fact that she ultimately falls in love with him and has to convince him that she really loves him after he's already found out that she's been lying to him is one of the oldest plot ploys in the book of writing cheesy comedies ( and cheesy action movies , and cheesy dramas , etc . ) . Mr . Deeds is a film made for Adam Sandler films . I will readily admit that I enjoy many of Sandler's films ( such as Billy Madison , to some extent , The Waterboy , Happy Gilmore , which I LOVED , etc . ) , but for the same reason that I like to watch Van Damme and Steven Seagal movies . They are totally goofy B-movies , but there is some sort of backwards , amusing charm to them that makes them attractive . Critics are sure to hate those movies , as well as a movie like Mr . Deeds , and they have plenty of reason to , obviously , but Sandler fans are not likely to be entirely disappointed .
544418	562732	99856	4.0	The Invisible Maniac has a respectable enough story , in the tradition of the Nutty Professor , but it makes up for the bad acting and directing by throwing in numbing amounts of gratuitous nudity .	Take one look at the cover of this movie , and you know right away that you are not about to watch a landmark film . This is cheese filmmaking in every respect , but it does have its moments . Despite the look of utter trash that the movie gives , the story is actually interesting at some points , although it is undeniably pulled along mainly by the cheerleading squads ' shower scenes and sex scenes with numerous personality-free boyfriends . The acting is awful and the director did little more than point and shoot , which is why the extensive amount of nudity was needed to keep the audience's attention . In The Nutty Professor , a hopelessly geeky professor discovers a potion that can turn him into a cool and stylish womanizer , whereas in The Invisible Maniac , a mentally damaged professor discovers a potion that can make him invisible , allowing him to spy on ( and kill , for some reason ) his students . Boring fodder . Don't expect any kind of mental stimulation from this , and prepare yourself for shrill and enormously overdone maniacal laughter which gets real annoying real quick . . .
544203	562732	1104006	4.0	Yeah , I felt a little walled in myself ?	Walled In is the kind of horror film that sets itself up in a bizarre location and then explains all kinds of bizarre rules to make the scariness work . The movie opens with a series of headlines that explain the terrible discovery of 16 bodies cemented into the walls of a building , including that of the architect who designed it . We learn that the person who walled them in , Joseph Malestrazza , was never caught , and then we cut to 15 years later , when the building is planned to be demolished . Mischa Barton stars as Samantha , a young member of the demolition company family , perfectly named the Walczak's ( the ' c ' is silent ) . She recently graduated from engineering school and it becomes her first lone assignment to visit the building and supervise its demolition . It's a perfect set-up for a horror movie , I suppose , although as soon as we get to the building , the one where the 16 bodies were discovered , you remember , and learn that the wife and son of the murdered architect are still living there , the movie takes a pretty serious turn for the worse . I would think that if a man suffered the terrible fate of being murdered and cemented into the walls of a building , his wife would take it upon herself not to raise their son for his entire life in that building . But that's me . Upon her arrival we meet the woman living there and her creepy son , who explains things to Samantha that the lights go off every six minutes to conserve energy , she shouldn't go to the 8th floor ( that's Malestrazza's quarters , you see , and it's never cleaned ) , and whatever you do don't go on the roof ! I would think that someone planning the demolition of a building would explain the logical deficiency of avoiding certain parts of it , but we understand that this is a horror movie and these goofy rules he's explaining are a set-up for freaky sequences that are to follow . There's also the issue of a few remaining people who lived in the building and who are not likely to appreciate Sam arriving to destroy it . The young boy also worries that Malestrazza will be offended by her plans . I was reminded of the brilliant novel House of Leaves in a lot of things about the movie . Sam discovers enormous discrepancies between the blueprints and the actual measurements of the house , which in that book led to a fascinating and frightening series of events , but in the movie leads to the cheap and utterly witless third act . There is also a lot of throwbacks to Psycho in the relationship between the young boy and his mother in an isolated location . Sam even describes the building as being " like the Bates Motel , only bigger , " and at one point the mother forbids her son to go near Sam , telling him that Sa could never take care of him the way she does . Creepy . Ultimately we learn about an " ancient architectural belief " that provides the reason that Malestrazza killed people and walled them into his buildings ( and also the reason why not one of the 27 buildings that Malestrazza built have ever been torn down ) . It gives the movie the feel of something with more thought in it that it actually has . I felt a little flicker of interest when this was revealed , but in retrospect it strikes me as little more than a screenwriters brainstorm . I understand that Walled In is based on a novel , and I hope the novel is better than the movie . Books , especially horror books , are always better than the movie , ad if someone read the book and thought it was good enough to make into a film , it must have been better than this movie , because it has all the sign-posts of a weak horror film . It's full to the brim with cheap scares ( notice the Screeching Cat Scare , which at least was made a little bit different but essentially is the same old thing , and my favorite , a scary rose scare . You have to see that one to believe it ) and blatantly rips off a whole series of other horror movies . I'm curious what the movie would have looked like had director Gilles Paquet-Brenner never seen Psycho , Texas Chainsaw , and the Nightmare on Elm Street films . He even uses that " One , Two , Freddy's Coming For You " song several times . Real creative there , buddy . I won't go into the details of the end of the film partly because I don't want to ruin it for you but mostly because it's so dumb that I don't want to bother spending my time explaining it . I will tell you one thing though . There's a particularly amusing scene where the boy accuses Samantha of thinking that he's nothing but a " crazy little boy . " You gotta see this scene , man , it's hilarious . At the time that he says that to her , I won't tell you what he happens to be doing , but when you make a statement like that , it's generally not a good time to be acting like a crazy little boy . What follows that scene is a third act that is not entirely without effect , but definitely one of the dumbest situations that I've seen in a horror movie in some years . It is so bizarre and makes so little sense that the movie almost becomes a mystery . Another mystery is why the thing got made in the first place , but sadly , after seeing the movie , I don't think I'm every going to be able to bring myself to read the book ?
544410	562732	469641	4.0	The worst terrorist attack in Hollywood history .	It seems that Oliver Stone's patriotism is too much for him to objectively helm a story like World Trade Center , which focuses on two firefighters trapped in the rubble of the twin towers after the September 11th attacks . The problem with the movie is that it is simultaneously trying to be a memorial to those killed in the attacks ( and particularly honor the bravery of the firefighters ) and still retain some realism . As a memorial it is successful , although pretty cloying at times , but the realism fails completely . If , in fact , there was any intention towards realism at all . In the latter point , it may very well be that Stone was not going for realism . I am no expert on the logistics of collapsing buildings , but I have read extensively on the subject of the attacks , as I imagine most Americans have , and I've seen a lot of pictures as Ground Zero was being cleared of the bottom floors of the towers . In one picture , I remember seeing a messy wall of material that looked as solid as a rock which was about 10-12 feet high , which was described as 15-20 floors compressed together . The idea that two firefighters are caught underneath the 100 + floors of collapsing towers is laughable , and this , my friends , is not a comedy . Then again , I think the focus of the film is on the breed of suffering and heroism involved in the rescue efforts just after the attacks , and the plight of the firefighters ' families and their loved husbands and fathers and brothers and sons rushed off into what looked so much like certain death . This is the most heroic thing that many Americans have ever seen , certainly for me . And while the film succeeds at telling these stories and at moving the audience ( really , the 9-11 attacks are so engrained in the American mind that it's impossible not to be moved ) , although it is definitely guilty of trumping up the Hollywood bravado to an almost unbearable degree at times . Because of this , a lot of the movie comes across as contrived , which is too bad , because when you watch something as important to America as this , you don't want to ever feel like you're looking at a sound stage , you don't ever want to feel like you can sense the crew standing just a few feet away from the action on screen , sipping nonfat caramel macchiattoes and flipping through the latest shooting script , wondering if they can squeeze in any more heroic one liners . But you can here . A lot . There has been some talk about the irony of Oliver Stone , not exactly popular with the conservative crowd , making a film that is described by many right-wingers as the most " pro - American , pro-family , pro-faith , pro-male , flag-waving , God Bless America films you will ever see . " It also mentions a connection between the attacks to the war in Iraq . I had been under the impression that such a connection had long since been discredited , but no matter . It is a difficult situation that the two main characters are trapped and almost completely unable to move for about half the movie , and it's unfortunate that , to keep the action moving , we see some of those deadpan emotional flashbacks of the guys with their wives and kids , which just strikes me as something that should never be in a film like this , if only because it is such weak screen writing . Remember that slow motion scene in Top Gun showing Goose with his wife and kid ? They may as well add a subtitle saying he's gonna die soon . There is another film about the 9-11 attacks , United 93 , which is vastly superior to this one . It has been criticized for having too little emotion which , interestingly , is exactly what this movie needed . The emotions involved with the September 11th attacks are strong and universal , we don't need a movie to hold our hand and lead us through them . United 93 succeeded because it presented the facts in an almost documentary style , allowing the audience to feel their own emotions . Not this movie , and it's too bad . There is one rather bizarre looking character , Dave Karnes ( based on a real man ) , who saw the attacks on TV and immediately knew that the country was at war . He rushed to Ground Zero and managed to help the two heroes escape from the rubble , and then the film closes with a title card that mentions that he went on to serve two tours of duty in Iraq . Nothing is mentioned about the fact that Iraq was not involved in the attacks , but the focus is on the patriotism , not fighting the right battle . Stone has been justifiably criticized for this connection , similar to the conspiracy theories that he presented in JFK . I'm normally a big fan , but this goes down as one of the great many movies that SHOULD have been a great , important American film , and just isn't .

I know that I am going to get some pretty angry e-mails from at least a few people , as is almost always the case when I write scathing reviews of popular movies . I realize that Gentlemen Prefer Blondes is a classic comedy , and not only because it stars Marilyn Monroe . But therein lies my biggest problem with the film . Marilyn Monroe is not very arguably the most famous blonde who ever lived , and in this movie she glorifies air-headedness and the prostitution of the female form for financial gain . Before I go on , by the way , I would like to point out that she delivered a wonderful performance and I am saying nothing against either her as an actor or as a person , but this role should probably not have been given to her because her tremendous iconography gives her the power to influence a great many women , and the influence delivered in this movie is not a very healthy one , especially in the early 1950s . I was shocked when I read the review on the IMDb's title page for Gentlemen Prefer Blondes . ' TJBNYC , ' as he or she calls him - or herself , starts out by saying that ' Anyone who's ever written off Marilyn Monroe as ' just ' a dumb blonde are directed to this film immediately . ' I think it would be a better idea to point out to anyone that's ever written off Marilyn Monroe as ' just ' a dumb blonde be reminded of the nature of the medium of film . What you see on screen are characters and if the actor makes you believe a character is a dumb blonde , it goes to the credit of their acting ability . But more important than that , this is probably the last film that someone like that should be directed to see because a dumb blonde is exactly what she portrays . If , however , you manage to make it through to the end of this endurance test , you will see that they luckily made an effort to show that she had something going on in her head all along , even though this effort is a feeble and almost entirely futile one . ( spoilers ) On the one hand , Marilyn Monroe plays a character named Lorelei Lee who says things with wide-eyed innocence ( oblivion ) like , ' Piggy was playing the python , and I was the goat . ' and ' This is like a room , isn't it ! ' I always feel dumber after watching stuff like that , but I suppose there is some intelligence to her character that becomes apparent as we realize her cunning ability to get the pretty things that she likes by using whatever power she has available . Sure , this is completely useless knowledge to anyone but an air-headed blonde , but there you go . Lorelei has something going on in her head after all . The real point where they vainly attempt to cancel out her blondeness is at the very end when she turns everything around and Gus's father comes right out and says , ' Hey , they told me you were stupid ! ' What you have here is a shameless attempt to deliver Marilyn as a complete bimbo and then try to suddenly turn it around at the end to make it seem that she was putting us on the whole time and she's really not a moron after all . The problem that Howard Hawks should have kept in mind is that the audience forms their opinion of a character very early in a movie , and if we see a bimbo for 90 minutes , she stays a bimbo no matter how smart she acts in the last scene . There is nothing spectacular about Gentlemen Prefer Blondes , there are even several scenes that are downright bad or tasteless or both , such as the goat / python scene mentioned above ( with a scene like this , NO amount of genius later in the film could reverse Lorelei's idiot character ) and the truly awful scene where Laura sings ' Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend ' in a skanky outfit to distract everyone . I can only imagine it is now considered a classic because Marilyn Monroe is the star . I haven't seen many of her other films , but I can only hope that they are better than this one .
544383	562732	89730	5.0	Mainstream ?	Strangely enough , I read a review of one IMDb user who asserted that Once Bitten is one of Jim Carrey's best performances since going mainstream . I'm curious as to what this user means by that statement , because Once Bitten was YEARS before Carrey went mainstream . Is this person saying that Carrey's performance here is better than his performances years later , when he did , in fact , get into mainstream films ? If so , I beg to differ . And if not , I still beg to differ . The first thing that struck me about Once Bitten is that it is a teen sex comedy , which is not something that I ever associated with Jim Carrey ( not the least reason for which is because most of his better know movies are not only above such childish comedy but were made long after his teenage years were over ) . Even in Once Bitten he was about 23 years old , but the movie focuses on his inability to communicate very effectively with women , much less pull off any successful sexual encounters . Enter a vampire , surprisingly sexy for her 400 years , who must feed on three virgins or cease to exist . All desperate high school guy in the 80s should have been so lucky . The premise is ridiculous , comparable to those bad movies that feature things like strippers that turn into aliens , or other monsters that feed on humans by taking on the form of sexy naked women in order to seduce men . Where the movie goes right is in the two main characters , Lauren Hutton as the vampiress trying to feed on Mark Kendall , to whom Jim Carrey brings a surprisingly effective level of insecurity and awkward appeal . Carrey obviously remembers similar developmental difficulties in his own youth . Mark's two friends , the obligatory sex-starved geeks who bounce crude humor off of each other , are negligible , put into the movie for no other reason than for some vampire snacks and to have someone for Mark to complain to about his nervousness about sex , while they confidently give him all kinds of advice , momentarily forgetting that they share in at least his same level of cluelessness on the subject . While earlier , and dumber , sex comedies like Porky's made no attempt to be more than they are , dumb sex comedies , Once Bitten successfully tries to present a sort of lesson about the dangers of promiscuity , while at the same time failing ultimately because it tries to be too much than its material allows . Rather than seeking the old jugular , this vampiress prefers to drink from a more southerly location , providing a pretty ham-handed allegory of sexually transmitted diseases . Carrey has been prowling dingy bars in search of an easy first time ( in response to his lack of success with an un-promiscuous girlfriend ) , and ends up placing in grave danger the very parts that he is trying to get some much needed attention . There is a sad story behind the writing of the screenplay . David Hines , a college student desperately avoiding real life , took endless art classes to postpone graduation , and ultimately dropped out when it seemed that his screenplay for Once Bitten , at the time titled Nightlife , seemed to be taking off . The movie was put into production , produced , released , and then six months later sat on the shelves at Sam Goody , where Hines worked as a lowly entry level employee , constantly teased by his coworkers over the spectacular failure of his movie . I really can't say that I found it to be THAT bad , but again , this could be just because I'm a huge fan of Jim Carrey . Maybe the movie was just overshadowed by Fright Night ( also not great but better than Once Bitten ) , released the same year , and The Lost Boys ( vastly superior to both ) , released two years later . Either way , Once Bitten is hardly an underrated gem . The film itself is pretty dismal , but it remains interesting even if for no other reason than because you can so clearly see the budding elements of what would later become Jim Carrey trademarks . Not just his over-the-top comedy performances , but also even slight hints at his more dramatic roles , like when he goes to the Halloween party and is exasperated that he keeps having to explain that he's not dressed as a vampire , he's not even wearing a costume . It's a cheesy teen sex comedy , but Carrey makes it interesting , at least some parts . It's just too bad that he had to develop more of a career before people cared .
544907	562732	478087	5.0	How to ruin a fascinating true story .	Ah , Las Vegas , the city of lights . The place that probably offers more false promises than anywhere else in the world , Hollywood included . I've never been much of a gambler myself , usually when I go there I plan a given amount of money to gamble with and , once it's gone ( because I understand in advance that I'm gonna lose it ) then I stop and go back to my buddies and concentrate on getting nicely drunk . But cards are even less my thing . My friends back in Venice Beach had almost nightly poker tournaments that I couldn't get myself interested in to save my life , so my experience in gambling real money on card games is almost nonexistent . Nevertheless , I have an endless fascination with Vegas , and the true story of those people from MIT who raked in hundreds of thousands of dollars by counting cards at the blackjack tables should have been a great movie . Unfortunately , 21 is not it . The movie deals with the true story of those MIT students , but the movie is so heavily fictionalized that it's nearly impossible to tell what really happened under what ultimately turns out to be a twisted mass of Hollywood clichés . Jim Sturgess plays Ben Campbell , a college student graduating from MIT and about to fulfill his lifelong dream of attending Harvard Medical School . The only problem is that he doesn't have any money and Harvard Med will run him $300 , 000 . Since he lives in a world that contains one single scholarship opportunity and not a hint of student loans ( seriously , with an academic history like Ben's , there are about a million ways to get the money he needs ) , he sees his chances of going to Harvard Med slipping away . Soon he meets a professor , Micky Rosa ( Kevin Spacey ) who introduces him to a carefully designed card-counting scheme involving himself and a few of his most gifted students . They all head to Vegas and try to beat the system , while security chief Cole Williams ( Laurence Fishburne ) lurks in the darkened security office surrounded by TV screens watching out for people like them . I wanted to see a movie about the real story , something almost documentary-like that tells not only how they beat the Vegas system but also how they got caught and what happened afterwards , but 21 plays more like a completely fictional story . It's like a cheap version of Ocean's 11 except the only laws being broken are when Williams drags various characters into the casino basement to , ah , knock some sense out of them . I have no idea how card counting works , I'm just not a math guy . The movie doesn't concern itself with helping us understand it either , beyond some quickly edited sequences showing the main characters devising an intricate counting and communication scheme that will allow them to work together in the casinos without anyone realizing that they are a team . The problem is that the card counting itself requires a tremendous intellect , but the characters are phenomenally stupid . Are we supposed to believe that the same people who perfected this counting scheme would come up with signals so stupidly obvious as linking your arms behind your back when the deck's hot ? It was bad enough that they all constantly glance nervously at each other whenever they're in the same room , but that arm-linking thing was amazing . Every single time ! ! Didn't they ever think it would be a good idea to change things up a little bit ? It would require a stupendous quantity of incompetence on the part of the security administration to miss THAT . Even worse is the fact that in order to remind us that they're humans , the characters have to make drastic mistakes , but drastic gambling mistakes done well will give you something like the poker scene at the end of Casino Royale . Here , they get dunk and blow their cover or make gambling errors that can only be described as purely moronic , and the screenplay is more concerned with cheesy relationships between the characters that only distract from what the story is really about . Pearl Harbor had the same problem . We want to see a story about a major historical event , not some idiotic romance between Josh Hartnett and whoever that girl was . Even worse , nothing is told about what happened after they were caught . They won't go to jail because counting cards isn't illegal ( and shouldn't be ) , but the movies ties everything up with so much obviously fabricated nonsense that it's nearly impossible to walk out of the theater without feeling cheated . And in a movie about card-counting and taking Vegas for hundreds of thousands of dollars , it's the casinos who should feel cheated , not the audience .
544606	562732	280486	5.0	The latest Chris Rock action comedy that apparently doesn't realize that it's a comedy .	Chris Rock stars as a CIA agent and a street hustler , twin brothers separated at birth . When the more successful brother , Kevin ( ironically the one who got his act together and made a life for himself , yet also the one who got himself killed ) is shot escaping a touchy sting operation in which he and his team try to buy a stolen nuclear weapon with cyber money that doesn't exist in real life , the CIA are faced with abandoning a 2 year project and risking themselves because their new enemies are going to want to know what happened to their deal or seeking out Kevin's twin brother Jake , who makes a living whipping the crap out of unsuspecting chess players in Central Park and selling scalped tickets to just about any event you can imagine . At this point in the film , it's clear that the premise is a remarkably strong one for an action comedy - the irony of having a street hustler suddenly thrown into a top secret CIA operation . And when you throw in Chris Rock as the hustler and Anthony Hopkins as his new mentor , it seems that you simply can't go wrong . Unfortunately , the movie seems to lose track of the fact that it is a comedy , and in more ways that just forgetting to throw in some good one-liners . Bad Company was made and scheduled to be released before September 11th , but was then delayed for obvious reasons ( similar to the obvious reasons that delayed the release of the much more incendiary Collateral Damage , given its subject matter ) . Because the movie was written before the attacks , the writers can't have been expected to have known what bad taste it was to center the plot on a stolen nuclear device that was meant to level a major city on the eat coast . I don't hold that against it because of the attacks , but only because it is such a tired premise . When are we going to see some good action movies that are about something other than one guy who has to save a whole city from terrorists with big bombs ? There are points in the movie where it seems that the writers stopped and said , ' Oh wait , this is supposed to be a comedy , ' and threw in a few completely unamusing jokes here and there , mostly in the form of totally inappropriate one-liners from Rock that almost invariably fall completely flat . He and Hopkins do , however , have a bit of chemistry onscreen , but it is mostly wasted . This is a flashy Bruckheimer production , obviously , but it is one of the least interesting action films that Bruckheimer has turned out in years . Granted , most of his productions are cheesy crap , but this one even manages to be boring despite itself . I watched Bad Company right after watching Men in Black II , and so was already prepared for disappointment , but I found myself trying to figure out why exactly the movie is called Bad Company . Surely it can't be because the CIA is forced to employ someone literally off the street , because he turns out to be remarkably bright and much more capable than they had anticipated . Then at the end of the movie , just as the bad guy is about to get killed , he says something about how we Americans think we're so great but we just sit here while people all over the world suffer and die , and we just watch it on our televisions and grab another burger . This is , of course , disturbingly true , and it is not a small part of the reason that four airplane were hijacked in late 2001 . It's something that Americans love to ignore so that we can pretend we're victims . The victims on September 11th were the people in the buildings and the people in the planes and al of their families , the country itself was not . Does ' Bad Company , ' then , refer to the company that the rest of the world is in , being in the company of America ? It seems that the message that this film leaves resonating in your mind at the end is about what a selfish and greedy country America is , and how capable we are to ignore the suffering of the rest of the world as long as we have our fancy cars and our money and our heart disease instead of starvation . In this case , I guess Bad Company's not such a bad movie after all . It certainly gives a pretty potent wake up call at the end , but one that will probably be largely ignored along with the rest of the film . Ah well .
544613	562732	78437	5.0	Good clean cannibal fun !	Last Cannibal World claims to be a true story about a stone-age cannibal tribe living on the Malaysian island of Mindanao who captures a ' modern ' man named Robert Haper , who crash lands on the island . It seems that there is an oil mining crew camping out in the jungle while they search for drilling sites , and when a team flies in to check on them , the plane is damaged during landing and the drill team turns up missing . The pilot is sure he can fix the plane ( " If I can find the wheel it shouldn't be too hard to put it back again ! " ) , but won't fly until the following day , since it was getting dark . Before long , of course , the group ends up separated and being pursued by cannibals through the jungle , and then the movie becomes a strange mix of gruesome horror and a twisted look at the animal side of humans . Of course , cannibalism is not politically correct , so the cannibal tribe is presented as more like animals than humans , with the grunting and the throwing food at each other and the spontaneous copulation . These are evolutionary drop-outs if ever there were any , but the movie doesn't know where to stop in presenting their backwardness . Even the simplest animals have some instincts , particularly about things like eating and self-preservation , but not these people . One of the women tries to eat Harper's wristwatch , I suppose not possessing the basic abilities to distinguish between food items and non-food items , and for a tribe that has been living presumably for centuries or more in an alligator infested jungle , they sure spend a lot of time swimming and getting eaten or almost eaten by alligators . A woman gives birth by the riverside and , after detaching the umbilical cord with her teeth ( and after an extreme close-up to make sure we know the baby is a girl ? I didn't need that ? ) , she goes for a nice little swim and gets immediately eaten along with her new baby . Smart . Gore fans should be happy , there is sufficient disturbing gore in the movie , although most of the effects ( such as the decomposed head in the beginning ) are pretty weak , as is the editing . But there is lots of grotesque feeding scenes which include lots of filthy savages stuffing flesh in their mouths with lots of nasty sucking sounds and twitching meat . Nice ! Some of the movie doesn't make much sense , like the way they tie up one of the natives and put carnivorous ants on his arms , which slowly eat him while he screams his head off . It's one of the more disturbing scenes in the movie with all that screaming , but why would they do that ? I thought it must be a sacrifice , but what kind of tribe sacrifices their own people rather than animals ? And who is he being sacrificed to ? The Ant God ? Even if he was being punished , for a cannibal tribe to feed a man to ants seems like a waste of food , doesn't it ? Harper spends a good part of the movie trapped in a cage , although I missed the reason for that too . They couldn't have been fattening him up to eat him because that would also be a huge waste of food . Maybe they were saving him for a special occasion . At any rate , they put in this bizarre looking bird with him , and it's strange that when Harper kills it , its squawking instantly stops and gives the scene a genuine finality of death that is more realistic than anything else in the movie . At least until it starts squawking again . There are two directions that the movie could go once a " sympathetic " jungle woman begins helping Harper ? it could have Harper try to lift the woman out of the barbaric world in which she lives , or he could descend into barbarism himself . The most interesting thing that the movie does is that it goes in both directions , and actually does it pretty well . It's a pretty sharp indictment of Harper ( especially if this really is a true story ) , given that , even after saving her from being sexually assaulted by another native , he rapes her himself . And he didn't just force himself on her , her beat her and then raped her . Are we still supposed to accept him as a protagonist ? After this , it may be a little strange to see that she basically becomes his loving cave-wife , bringing him food and cleaning and caring for him , until you remember that these are savages and I guess this is just how women expect to be treated . And Harper is happy , of course , given that he has found himself a beautiful island wife , and with obviously man-made breasts , no less . There is a weak attempt at symbolism during Harper's brief descent to his most primal instincts , and then soon he meets up with another man from the plane , who laments that no matter how much mud he smears into a badly infected wound on his knee , it never gets better . He must not have been paying much attention in his Wilderness Survival class . All in all I guess the movie is as satisfying as a cannibal movie can be . At least you know what to expect , though . I think any movie with the word " cannibal " in the title is going to be pretty much like this . It's bad but it's a fun and disgusting kind of bad , the thing you can watch with your buddies over a few beers and have a few good laughs !
543967	562732	163651	5.0	Can't Hardly Wait To Get Laid .	( spoilers ) American Pie is yet another goofy teenage comedy full of trashy sex jokes and idiot kids trying to get together with beautiful girls , and in the end , it works for everyone except that weird red-headed guy . I'm so sick and tired of movies like this , and if Sean William Scott had not been in this movie , there would not have been a single funny part in it . American Pie is an exploitative film that takes advantage of the vast amounts of immaturity readily found in modern audiences . I'll admit that I laughed at the movie , but it's the kind of laugh that lasts for seconds , and as soon as it's over , it's never funny again . You actually feel cheated because after you watch the movie you can look back and you realize how dumb the jokes really are . Except , of course , for the scene at the very end when Steve Stifler walks into the basement of his house after the party ( ' Mom ? Shibrick ? ! ' ) . THAT will NEVER stop being funny . I don't want to give the impression that I feel that this movie was pounded out in five minutes with no thought and then thrown into production just to make money , because I realize that on some levels , maybe one or two , it is quality comedy . But on all other levels , make no mistake , this is fast-food cinema . It may be fun to watch , but there's no nutritional value .
544605	562732	120912	5.0	A huge step down from the original .	Sequels are almost inherently inferior to their original films . The reason that a sequel is ever made is because the original film was a huge success and therefore people want to see more , but at the same time have developed high expectations from the original film , expectations which are rarely if ever completely fulfilled . In my opinion , every sequel has a right not to live up to the original that it followed , but Men In Black II abuses the privilege almost as much as Austin Powers has already done twice so far . Roger Ebert makes an interesting comment in his review of Men In Black II , stating that the original was so enormously successful because it was unexpected and we had not seen anything like it , while the second one is a rehash of the original , and now we HAVE seen something like it . The expected result is that , like the two Austin Powers sequels , what we have here is little more than an extension of the same jokes that we saw in the original film . The entire cast has come back , of course , since this is guaranteed to be a hugely popular film ( although at the same time guaranteed to be an artistic failure ) , and we also see a few more introductions to the cast of actors and artists with flailing careers like Lara Flynn Boyle and even Michael Jackson , who embarrasses himself in the film by playing the part of someone desperately trying to secure himself a position as one of the Men In Black ( ' I can be Agent M ! Pleeeeeeeeeease ? ? ? ' ) . Naturally , everything that got a laugh in the original film is milked to death here , although not entirely without effect . I thought it was really funny when K blows off Jeebs ' head ( feeding off of one of the more amusing scenes from the original during J's introduction to the aliens amongst whom he lives ) , and J asks him how he knew that Jeebs ' head would grow back if his memory had not been restored , and K replies , ' It grows back ? ' Not very creative , but certainly amusing . The movie has its strong points , I am not saying that it was a stone-faced bore , but the problem is that it completely feeds off of whatever was successful about the original film . There is virtually nothing creative presented in this film , it is much talkier and drier than the original and doesn't seem to have a personality of its own . MIB followed an alien disguised as a redneck named Edgar as he tries to get his hands on a galaxy that is small enough to fit on a cat's collar . In the second film , we not only have a charm on a bracelet that is the most sought-after item in the film , but we also catch a couple of overly brief glances at some tiny populations of life forms that are able to fit into an airport locker but are still not able to secure themselves a larger part in this film , which chooses instead to entertain us with a talking dog . How's that again ? Why is it that there were so many interesting creatures in the original film but this one gives us a quick glimpse of some fascinating creatures but then tries to distract us with the talking ( and sometimes singing ) antics of a tiny dog , which had just the right size role in the original film ? Things like this and the fact that the movie had nothing new to add to the Men In Black story bring the quality of MIIB way down , leaving it to tag along behind its predecessor like an annoying little sister . We already know there is going to be a Men In Black III ( hey , if they made a second sequel after the ridiculous Austin Powers 2 ? ) , so we can only hope that the producers and director will take a little more time in deciding how to entertain us and what kinds of life forms to focus on , because this was entirely overlooked in this sequel . Even the enormously sexy Boyle was not comfortable on her role and therefore unconvincing as an alien villain in disguise ( indeed , it was more convincing that the writers were so unconfident in their script that they felt the need to gloss it over with a sexy villain than it was that she was a threat to the MIB ) , and Mr . Smith and Mr . Jones had little to nothing to work with in their roles . There is still something left to be salvaged in the Men In Black story . Like the story for Hollow Man , there are nearly endless possibilities , but they were unfortunately largely ignored in this film . At least it's all uphill from here ?
544771	562732	363276	6.0	Average .	I wasn't really sure what to expect when I rented this movie . I tend to be pretty impressed with psychological thrillers ( I loved In Dreams , for example , which was not hugely popular ) , so I thought I would give it a shot even though it seemed to be one of those movies that pops up at the video store , the direct to video nonsense that large chain stores tend to stock one or two copies of , like they're obligated to buy at least a copy or two of every DVD that comes out each week . That was clearly not the case at Blockbuster , as I had looked up new DVDs for this week on the IMDb and was very excited about renting Whispering Corridors , but was greeted with a blank expression when I asked the girl at the counter if they had any copies in stock . I finally decided to cancel my movie pass . At any rate , I rented Session 9 at the same time , because I was going to go to my brother's house to watch a movie and he is the manager of a mental health facility here in LA so I thought it would be fun to watch something like one of these . I have seen Session 9 before and was pretty impressed , but Madhouse did not meet my expectations . It is an interesting film and there are a lot of well-done aspects , but there are also a lot of not so well-done aspects . I grow tired very quickly , for example , of horror movies that take place in hospitals or mental hospitals that are so obviously horror movie sets , as was the case in this movie . There are a lot of efforts at jump out of your seat scares , most of which are executed with sound , but I think the most impressive thing about the movie was the editing . There are several scenes where there is very fast paced and effective editing which achieves a pretty good effect in creating a creepy atmosphere . Lance Henriksen's talent is completely wasted as the hospital director who appears offended that some rookie psychologist intern would insinuate that his filthy , filthy hospital could use some renovation , and he is promptly brought upstairs to the level 5 ward or whatever they called it , which is evidently without electricity . Nice . There is a slightly interesting combination of horror and psychological thriller here , but not quite enough to overcome a pervasive sense of predictability which is ever-present throughout the film , endlessly inviting you to call out smartass remarks , kind of like that goofy movie Hidalgo did . This is not a terrible film , but as I mentioned , it's part horror and part psychological thriller , and there are better horror movie and better psychological thrillers out there , and they're not hard to find .
543912	562732	120749	6.0	Mercury sinking ?	Okay , before you condemn Mercury Rising for being what it admittedly is , a cheesy action movie , you should at least consider that it accomplishes what it sets out to do . This movie was obviously never meant to win any Academy Awards ( otherwise they wouldn't have cast Bruce Willis , at least at that stage in his career ) , but it does have some effective action sequences . The problem that I have with the movie is not that it fails as an action movie , but that it could have been so much better . The good action sequences are padded with at least as many awful ones , and there was plenty of thought put into about 5 % of the story , while the rest is on auto-pilot . There is a great opening action scene where Arthur Jeffries ( Bruce Willis ) plays an undercover FBI agent acting as a robber in an effort to end a bank robbery safely , before the trigger-happy cops outside suddenly decide to open massive fire , completely unprovoked by anything except the passage of time . What follows is one of those endlessly satisfying scenes where the angry hero stomps out to the official in charge who's stupid decision resulted in the deaths of all those bank robbers , criminal or not , as he defies all ranking by smacking him in the face with his pistol , although I can't help wishing that he had done something even more . Unfortunately , this is one of the most satisfying scenes in the movie , which goes gradually downhill from here until the end . Miko Hughes , one of American's beloved child actors who can actually act , adds to his already extensive filmography with his portrayal of Simon Lynch , an autistic boy who loves puzzles a little too much . Autism is presented in a fairly straightforward manner , although the potential for massive intellectual processing is hugely enhanced and milked for all it's worth here . The problem with the movie is that it takes an enormously unlikely scenario related to autism and makes and entire film out of it . Simon has cracked a government super-code that was placed deep within a puzzle in a ' geek's puzzle magazine ' to test it's durability , and when he manages to decipher and call the secret phone number , all hell breaks loose . And by ' all hell , ' of course , I mean the rest of the goofy plot of the movie . The film starts off presenting an intelligent story about national security , until we realize that this is a code that they spent billions of dollars on without bothering to explain where those dollars went . This may be something that I just don't know , but what is it about a code that costs billions of dollars to make ? Is it the two guys in the little computer room who charge too much for their services ? Are the rates for Federal Hitmen getting out of control ? This is where the movie really slips , by the way . Instead of simply admitting that there is obviously a problem with the code , which can be solved by a 9-year-old boy , autistic or not , and then setting about changing the code , the FBI agents involved literally turn into murderers , sending out a hit man , black gloves and all , to murder the boy and his parents , erasing him from existence and then hoping no one ever asks any questions . The action in Mercury Rising succeeds , for the most part ( except for some awful blue-screen scenes , like the one between the trains ) , but it has enormous problems on a foundational level . Some stuff succeeds ( I rather enjoyed the scene in the wine cellar , but even this is founded on a movie with an unstable premise . I think that Roger Ebert pointed this out best at the end of his review when he says that if a billion dollar code can be cracked by an autistic boy , don't kill the boy , kill the programmers .
543966	562732	69897	6.0	What the hell does ' blaxploitation ' mean ?	I imagine it has something to do with the weak script and plot that Coffy has , but this movie doesn't exactly exploit African Americans any more than a sex thriller like Poison Ivy or something exploits white people . Coffy isn't really that bad of a movie if you can look past the same old revenge plot and the fact that , while she's not bustin ' some hoodlum ass , Coffy is some sort of nurse in her spare time . This woman is like the black female version of Rambo , but the film doesn't really take itself seriously enough for this to be a problem . Coffy is a tough black woman who decides to take matters into her own hands when the law proves powerless to help catch the drug dealers who turned her little sister into a drugged out vegetable . To make matter's worse , a friend of Coffy's named Carter , a police officer , gets beaten ( in a pathetic fight scene ) and suffers brain damage , further enraging Coffy . The whole movie is about drugs and violence , and Coffy pretends to be Mr . George's newest ho so that she can get close to her enemies and bring them down from the inside . Mr . George , by the way , is a hilariously stereotypical 70s pimp , with his felt hat , ridiculous glasses , and matching pastel outfit that is so tight that he sports a cameltoe . While at a party with Mr . George , Coffy contaminates his drug supply , replacing his cocaine stash with sugar . This is the party where that classic cat-fight scene takes place , with Coffy getting into a side-splitting scuffle with all the rest of Mr . George's harem , and having committed the laughable idea of booby-trapping her hair with razor blades . Okay , now we're really getting to know how much this movie takes itself seriously . And I won't even mention the monstrous lesbian girlfriend of Priscilla , the character that was introduced just before the most idiotic fight scene in the entire film . And then there was the car chase near the end of the film in which the cop drives like a Duke of Hazzard for no apparent reason . While the movie is filled with crap like this and is therefore a definitive B-movie , there were some relatively interesting things going on . For example , it was actually pretty clever the way that Coffy was able to turn the drug dealers against each other so that she didn't have to do all of the killing herself . Also , while all of the fight scenes were awful , some of the violence was surprisingly , and often disturbingly , convincing . When George is dragged to death behind the car , for example , it was obviously a dummy being dragged but the fact that hate-crimes like this have been so notoriously committed against blacks , the emotional impact made it much more effective . Maybe that's what blaxploitation is referring to . The standard revenge plot is not given much of a twist in Coffy , and the closing scene with her walking alone on a beach at sunset doesn't really fit with the rest of the movie . There is some pretty funny dialogue , though . White Zombie fans are sure to recognize her quote early in the film just before she un-heads some drug dealer with a shotgun ( ' This is the end of your rotten life you mother-FCKIN'-dope pusher ! ' ) . BLAM ! ! Yeah Coffy ! And then at the end , some guy begs for his life while in a swimming pool while Coffy points a shotgun at him , and she says , ' Sheeeit , I ain't gonna kill you . ' BLAM ! ! Yeah Coffy ! It's no secret that this is not Oscar material . It's a cheesy action film with bad acting and a recycled story , but if you keep that in mind when you watch it , it's actually enjoyable , at least on a few meager levels . Maxim magazine lists Coffy as number 7 on its list of the 50 best B-movies of all time , and there can clearly be no mistake about its status as a B-movie . Enjoy , but be aware of the movie's limitations .
544785	562732	184858	6.0	Reindeer Games attempts to run with the likes of such classics as Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction , but unfortunately it falls significantly short .	Reindeer Games is a good thriller . It is fun to watch , it has a good story , it's entertaining , and even most of the acting is respectable enough . However , as a whole , the film is pretty weak . Ben Affleck is a car thief who is serving a six year sentence in prison . His cell-mate is a man named Nick Cassidy ( James Frain ) , who seems to have met a beautiful woman named Ashley ( Charlize Therun ) in some sort of prison pen pal system . Rudy and Nick are scheduled to be released on the same day , but Nick has a run-in with a convict and winds up getting killed . Upon his release , Rudy has the bright idea to pose as Nick Cassidy so that he can get , uh , better acquainted with this Ashley girl that he has been hearing about for so long . Unfortunately , her truck driver / amatuer criminal older brother has found out from his letters to her that he previously worked in a casino , and he and his gang want Nick's help ( whether he's willing to help or not ) to rob that casino . Unable to prove that he's not Nick Cassidy and unaware of the design of the inside of the casino , Rudy is then faced with the challenge of successfully robbing this place so that the gang doesn't kill him , while at the same time avoiding getting caught so that he doesn't go back to jail for the rest of his life . The story is good . The huge holes ( why would someone as beautiful as Ashley turn to a prison pen pal system to look for dates ? ! ) are covered up pretty well by the time the film ends , and luckily the acting , for the most part , makes up for the crudeness of the script . The plot is derived from Quentin Tarantino's trademark of showing the end of the story at the beginning of the film . This is always an interesting thing to see , especially in a film like this . However , probably the most disturbing thing about Reindeer Games is the extensive and inexplicable use of blue screens and deep focus photography . There were a lot of shots that showed a face or a gun or something close to the camera , and everything else in the shot , everything that is far away from the camera , is also in focus . There is nothing inherently wrong with this , but it is unnatural , and it calls attention to the fact that there is a movie camera right there . Filmmaking is one of the few professions where invisibility is a goal for success , and while this deliberate violation of that rule is not necessarily prohibited , it should only be committed with good reason . There were scenes in Reindeer Games where I couldn't figure out why deep focus photography and especially blue screens were needed . Despite all of that , however , it did give the film a very distinctive look . Despite the film's numerous shortcomings , Reindeer Games is a fairly well-made crime thriller . I've seen Gary Sinise look better in other films ( see every other film he's ever been in except Mission to Mars ) , and Charlize is not entirely convincing at times , although she did deliver a satisfactory performance , all told . And most of all , if you like plot twists , check this one out , because there are plenty .
544617	562732	274166	6.0	" The word ' mistakes , ' sir , is one that does not appear in my dictionary ? "	Our first look at Johnny English is as an ultra-smooth secret agent , which turns out to be a dream sequence as we meet the real English , a bumbling desk jockey who fantasizes about a life of danger . The movie turns in a completely different direction when we realize that this is a dream sequence , and I have to say that it is not a disappointing turn at all . Far from being a wild turn from Atkinson's most successful character , Johnny English is basically Mr . Bean playing James Bond , and in true Bean style . This is an excellent premise that allows for plenty of mishaps and mayhem , but unfortunately it also takes away some of the movie's intended effect , because we know that just about everything English does will be wrong . Because of that , a lot of the biggest screw-ups are immediately obvious and then become tiresome as they play out , such as English sky-diving onto the wrong building and holding a lot of doctors and nurses hostage , holding up the wrong funeral and dancing on the coffin of a grieving family , and attempting to pull off the plastic face of the wrong Arch Bishop in front of an astonished crowd . Nevertheless , the movie very successfully emulates the look and feel of a Bond film , even more than the far superior Austin Powers did ( or either of the hugely disappointing sequels ) , and there are some genuine laughs . John Malkovich , as well , is surprisingly convincing as the French villain , illustrating once again the British distaste for French people , a widespread feeling that I don't really understand , but have seen evidence of it in several movies and TV shows ( Atkinson also lampoons them in the TV show The Thin Blue Line ) . Malkovich takes on a fake French accent , but for some reason it is not distracting . Maybe it's because of the movie he's in , which doesn't expect any part of it to be taken seriously . The premise is also overblown in the traditional Bond way . Pascal Sauvage ( Malkovich ) plans to steal the crown jewels , force the Queen to renounce her authority , get himself crowned king , and turn all of England into the world's biggest prison . You see , he has become a billionaire as the owner of something like 500 prisons in 60 countries , so why not close them all down and just own one country that is just one big prison ? Upon learning about the villain's goal , I wondered how the movie was received in England . During his speech where he describes his plan to his cronies , Sauvage his goal for the future of England as something like " 210 , 000 square miles of prime real estate conveniently separated from true civilization by 20 miles of ocean , and soon available for the entire world to dump their human waste into . " True civilization ? Human waste ? Those are some pretty strong words , even for such a goofy movie ! Nevertheless , the movie in undeniably fun , although it does have the feeling that it is made up of not quite enough good material stretched over a running time that's too long , even at a modest 80 minutes or so . Natalie Imbruglia shows up in a throwaway role as the Bond girl . She is beautiful and fills the role well but isn't really given much to do but show up occasionally and recite her sparse lines . There are some brief sex jokes that might make it not the best thing to show to the youngest viewers , although they are the ones that would probably appreciate most of the humor . All in all not a bad film , it's vintage Bean material that even with his astonishing incompetence he could manage to go from being a fifth-rate secret agent to quite literally being crowned the King of England ( entirely by accident , no less ) , but Rowan has done much better .
543850	562732	434964	6.0	Gammera's explosive debut . . .	Gammera , one of the most famous Japanese monsters to hit the big screen in the 1960s makes his debut in this zero-budget , politically charged monster thriller . It is interesting to consider the tensions that were taking place between certain nations at the time that the movie was made , especially between the U . S . and the former Soviet Union . There is no effort made to disguise the animosity that existed between the two , more than likely since that bitterness was needed as a catalyst to bring Gammera back from 200 million years of hibernation . The U . S . shoots down a suspicious bomber , which turned out to be Russian , over the arctic region . As is to be expected from those sneaky Russians , the bomber was loaded with hydrogen bombs which , upon impact , explode with sufficient force to not only thaw but also infuriate the sleeping Gammera . Lots of havoc is wreaked upon poorly constructed models of cities and airplanes and landscapes and such , and there is some strange subplot about a little boy obsessed with turtles who wants to expose Gammera for the gentle creature that he really is . Inspiration for the Iron Giant , maybe ? The special effects are astonishingly bad , but there was no budget and in the movie's defense , I have to say that the people involved in making it knew that they had no budget but they took very seriously their task of doing as much as they could with as little as they had . Classic Japanese monster fare .
544777	562732	387564	6.0	Here is something you can't understand . How I could just kill a man .	It's a bit odd to say that the thing I liked best about Saw was that there was true suffering in it rather than detached horror movie gore , but that was the case with this movie . I am reminded of some of Wes Craven's early films like Last House on the Left and The Hills Have Eyes , which were essentially about people doing horrible things to other people . It's a lofty effort for a couple of first time filmmakers and is very good as a debut horror / thriller / crime film , and the almost universal comparisons to Seven are to be expected . They are , after all , perfectly justified . The problem is that Seven never stops being interesting , while Saw makes no sense on a second viewing . My roommate watched the movie after I had already seen it , and I sat and watched parts of it and was reminded of the supplemental documentaries included with the Vista Series edition of The Sixth Sense , in which it is explained that they went to great lengths to make sure that they were making the movie honestly , that you could go back after you knew about the ending and see that the movie still made sense . This movie has no time or interest in that , because while the twists and turns are great during a first viewing and it is tremendously successful at making almost every single character look suspicious at some point or another , if you watch it when you already know the end the entire thing falls apart . Adam and Dr . Gordon wake up to find themselves locked in a filthy restroom of sorts , each chained to opposite sides of the room with a dead body between them holding a gun in one hand and a tape recorder in the other . They each have tapes in their pockets , and once Adam gets a hold of the tape recorder ( by using his shirt to help him reach it , and at Dr . Gordon's suggestion , which will become important later in this review ) , they listen to the two tapes and are given instructions by the killer . Adam is a voyeuristic photographer , his job is to prevent his own death , while Dr . Gordon's job is to kill Adam or his wife and daughter will be killed and he will be left there to die . Thus begins a lengthy series of ever more complicated events set up by the killer which are very convenient for a structured screenplay but make no sense in reality . Then again , the application of logic is a great way to dismantle a movie like this , and it should be noted that the movie is , in fact , highly entertaining during that first viewing . I like to think that it's not until the second viewing that you realize how much you have been cheated . ( spoilers ) Because of the shock of the ending , for example , you forgot that Zap , the hospital orderly , at one point holds a stethoscope to the daughter's chest while he points a gun at her mother's head , listening as the child's heartbeat speeds up in fear . Was he enjoying himself ? Kind of cancels out some of the sympathy you felt for him after he got killed at the end despite not being the kidnapper , didn't it . Then there was the issue of the objects just out of reach . Early in the film , it is Dr . Gordon that tells Adam to take off his shirt and use it to reach the tape recorder in the man's hand in the middle of the room , then later in the movie Dr . Gordon finds himself unable to reach the cell phone , which is ringing , so he takes off his shirt and ? uses it as a tourniquet to cut his foot off . What ? ? Given that the phone was about 8 inches out of his reach on linoleum , he may have been able to save his foot had he used his shirt to get it , like he suggested to Adam earlier . He must have been under a lot of stress . There is a good scene early in the movie where Adam finds the two saws and tosses one to Dr . Gordon and they both start sawing frantically at the chains around their ankles . Adam breaks his saw and Gordon soon gives up , realizing that it's not the chains the killer wants them to cut through , it's their feet . Reminds me of a great short story by Stephen King called " Survivor Type " where a man is stranded on a desert island and quickly finds himself with very , very little to eat . All in all I enjoyed the movie , it had a good surprise ending despite the fact that the path leading up to it was heavily and clumsily manufactured . It is an entertaining horror film , not a great one . Cary Elwes provides a bit of star power , but sadly delivers the worst performance I've ever seen him do , it was even worse than Liar Liar . If there is one thing I learned from this movie , it is that Cary Elwes can NOT cry on film . WOW . His emotional scenes were some of the worst I've ever seen . Clint Eastwood can cry better than this guy , and he makes Samuel L . Jackson look like a care bear . Schwarzenegger can cry better than this guy , for crying out loud . Maybe that's why he was so convincing in The Princess Bride , because Wesley was completely devoid of all emotion for most of the film . Whatever the case , this is still an interesting film . Fans of the great thrillers like Seven and The Sixth Sense may find themselves unimpressed if you go into it expecting more of the same level of quality , but horror fans are sure to get a kick out of it . At least the first time .
543799	562732	101917	6.0	Now you're playing with power !	At this point in the series it seems clear that the movies realize that they are no longer horror films but gory comedies , since they have long since lost what little power they ever might have had to be scary . The alleged Final Nightmare starts off with a quote from Friedrich Nietzsche which carries an unusual amount of dramatic intensity for a Nightmare on Elm Street movie since it fits so well with the series ' running theme , and is then followed by a sophomoric quote from Freddy at his classiest , ' Welcome to Prime Time , Bch . ' This is followed by a parody of The Wizard of Oz in which we see Freddy flying on a broom and yelling , ' I'll get you my pretty ! And your little SOUL too ! ! HAW HAW HAW ! ! ' And thus is the tone set for the rest of the movie . Instead of taking place at the setting of a mental hospital , this one takes place at a zero security shelter for disturbed kids . And I say ' zero security ' very literally . Police find junkies on the streets and send them to this place rather than deal with the paperwork involved in putting kids in juvenile hall , and yet detention at the facility is literally based on encouraging them not to leave . It's like attendance is based on the honor system . At one point , one of the counselors ( and the main character in the story ) , takes John Doe , their newest guest , on a trip back to his home town to confront the demons that are messing up his cognitive function . On the way there they find three kids stowing away in the company car ( which is a decrepit old white van covered in obscene graffiti ) , planning to escape . Rather than return them to the facility , she has them drop her and John Doe off at their destination and promise to DRIVE THEMSELVES BACK IMMEDIATELY ! ! What kind of a detention center is this anyway ? In case you were wondering , no thought was wasted on how she and John Doe were meant to get back themselves . That being said , the rest of the movie really isn't that bad , as long as you keep it in context of such scenes as that described above . The movie takes place 10 years after part 5 left off , and our John Doe is a mystery character who suffers from amnesia and is not all that anxious to have it cured . The basic premise is that Freddy has a kid running around somewhere who he intends to use to bring him fresh victims , giving him more time to concentrate on expanding his territory ( ' There's an Elm Street in every town ! ' ) . The movie smartly concentrates on the possibilities offered by the blurring of the line between reality and the dream world of unconsciousness , which is the exact thing that made the original movie so successful . Back then , you had a villain that was morbidly likable and a premise to which anyone could relate to because it's based on the real life crossing of that line , which you never really notice doing . Unfortunately , the movie trips all over itself with a series of ridiculous killing scenes which illustrate the sheer extent to which writers are running out of clever ideas for how Freddy should claim his victims . One poor kid gets his ear cut off , then Freddy gives it back to him , the kid picks it up and says , ' Yes ! ! ' and then puts it on the other side of his head ( the side which still has an ear attached to it ) , and Freddy proceeds to make loud noises until the kid's head explodes . What the hell was that ? Breckin Meyer makes an early appearance as some Freddy fodder and suffers a video game fate in which the entire movie stops in its tracks so that Freddy can put his feet up on the desk and kill someone with a joystick . It's not hard to tell that this movie was made at the height of Nintendo hysteria . We do get an interesting look into Freddy's past in which we learn not about the disturbing method of his conception , but what hid life was like before he became the Freddy Krueger we know . The kids in the movie come up with a pretty clever ( and long overdue ) plot to kill Freddy once and for all , but it's good that this was not the final installment in the series , if only because it would have been such an anticlimactic close to a series that had thus far spawned five sequels and fans around the world . The film originally featured a thrilling 3-D conclusion which , to the best of my knowledge , has been scrapped by the DVD production , I imagine because of the necessity for 3-D glasses . Still , we get a look inside Freddy's brain as well as a host of other scenes ( including Freddy's alleged death ) , which surely must have been a blast to see in 3-D . Sadly , the rest of the movie probably couldn't even have been supported on this gimmick alone , because it certainly doesn't have a lot else going for it .
544270	562732	3733	6.0	Kid auto races in drag .	Not much is the same about A Busy Day and Kid Auto Races at Venice except that for the early scene in this film where Chaplin is causing a disruption at a parade , where a camera crew are attempting to film . He begins as a member of the audience ( a female member , as it were ) , and almost immediately begins kicking and punching everyone in sight , and repeatedly being thrown into the same policeman , who seems each time to find the incident surprising and annoying but otherwise unimportant . As was the case in The Masquerader , Charlie is oddly convincing as a woman , and it is not until he starts throwing punches and kicks that it becomes clear that he is Charlie and not a woman . His diminutive stature and effeminate demeanor ( not to mention the absence of close-ups and the help of almost 100 years of deteriorated film stock ) help to pass him off as a woman , but his behavior is so familiar from so many short comedies full of punching and kicking that once the comedic violence starts , it's just Chaplin in a dress doing the same thing that he did in so many other films at the time . Of course , I say all of this in retrospect , because I am sure at the time audiences found the idea of a man dressing up like a woman and starting fights was endlessly hilarious , but the content of the comedy has not fared quite as well as Chaplin's later work . ( spoiler ) But at least since he insists on ending another film by falling in the water , he puts something of a spin on the idea here . I did , however , also find this film a bit interesting because it was filmed on location , so it shows a little of what Los Angeles looked like almost 100 years ago . I only wish I knew where exactly in LA it was filmed , just because I know the city so well and I love to think about Chaplin shooting his films on the same streets where I have been so many times . In A Day's Pleasure , for example , the opening scene is shot right next to his studio on La Brea Avenue , where I have been countless times , and I find it to be fascinating to look at that film and then go look at what the exact same spot looks like today .
544433	562732	734677	7.0	Ah the follies of social classes . . .	The Silence , like many Twilight Zone episodes , has a good twist at the end that lands it solidly in the realm of the supernatural , but unfortunately ( and also like a lot of other twilight zone episodes ) , that supernaturalness is reached more because of the main character's astonishing stupidity than anything really supernatural . Not that there is anything wrong with that . I appreciate wildly different behavior from what I would expect from myself in a show like the twilight zone infinitely more than in , for example , modern Hollywood horror movies , so The Silence ranks as one of the more entertaining episodes to me . Regardless of why the twist is as shocking as it is , the story is undeniably absorbing . In a hugely exclusive men's club , one elderly gentleman is enormously disturbed by one of the members ' constant , constant babbling . It's clear that all of the men are more than a little irritated by this one man and his unending , horizonless barrage of nonstop speaking , but one of them much more than anyone else . So much so , in fact , that he bets the man $500 , 000 that he can't keep his mouth shut for a year . One IMDb user states that this was a huge amount of money for the time period . I'm going to go ahead and suggest that this might be an enormous amount of money for ANY time period . And for ANY bet . It reminds me of a particular sentence from one of my favorite books ( Mark Twain's " A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court " ) that , for some reason , managed to stay with me . The main character is describing a rather unfortunate relationship he is in with an intensely uneducated woman who never seems to stop talking . One day he wanted to say something to her ( generally he would just let her talk and let his mind wander ) , so he says something like , " One afternoon I interrupted her in the middle of a sentence that she had begun that morning . . . " You get the idea . This guy is one of those people . I hear that the main actor suffered an injury that prevented him being filmed in anything other than profile from the right . This sounds like gossip to me , probably generated by an unusual filming style , although not exactly impossible , I suppose . What I love about this episode is how confident at the beginning the man who suggests the wager is . He is absolutely certain that this man won't be able to be quiet for a year , saying that he might last several weeks , maybe even a couple months , but the idea that such a man could last a full year was preposterous to him ( and maybe to us ) . As the end of the bet gets closer , the man gets increasingly desperate , even offering the guy $1 , 000 and then $5 , 000 to just quit the bet and walk away , even though there was only a couple months or weeks left by then . There is one thing though , I was curious about what kind of a guy would not only accept this kind of bet , but what kind of guy had the free time to drop everything in his life and lock himself in a glass room for a year . Didn't he have a job ? The exclusiveness of the gentlemen's club suggests that many of its patrons were independently wealthy , but if that was the case , why accept the bet in the first place ? At any rate , the show makes a great comment on upper class superficiality and the lengths people will go to in order to make money and , even more , boast their wealth and social status . Both , Serling says , can lead to disaster . . .
544205	562732	369060	7.0	Not quite the same but a worthy follow-up .	There is an unusual relationship between Infernal Affairs and Infernal Affairs II , which is the first sequel but is also a prequel and may even be better viewed before the first film . One of my Chinese friends , who suggested the trilogy to me , gave me part II first and said I could watch that before the original film , but I waited until I could buy the entire trilogy and watch them all in order . As it turns out , I may as well have listened to her . The premise is pretty much the same , a police officer working undercover for a mafia godfather , while the godfather has a trusted lieutenant working as a successful police inspector . Like the first film , it is an interesting play in the space between breaking and protecting the law , as each side is simultaneously living life as a criminal and law enforcement agent , which is clearly a difficult task . There is an interesting backdrop of the film of the return of Hong Kong to China in 1997 , the 10 year anniversary of which I experienced here in central China last June . And let me tell you , these people are really happy to have Hong Kong . They don't mess around with fireworks . For the Chinese New Year , for example , fireworks are set off almost nonstop for WEEKS . Trust me . I'm literally hearing the last of it outside my window at this very moment . None of this 30 minutes just after midnight nonsense ! It's true that the sequel is slightly lesser than the brilliant first film , but it is an engaging crime drama , especially impressive because of the performances of Police Inspector Wong ( Anthony Wong ) and the gangster Sam ( Eric Tsang ) , who were in charge of placing the moles on the opposing team , you might say . They are good friends and seem to have an easy relationship , except that each pretty much knows what the other is doing , they just don't know everything . And like in the original , this is a recipe for a pretty absorbing crime film .
544485	562732	388482	7.0	Jason Statham ? Jet Ski Pilot . Jason Statham ? Jet Ski Pilot .	The first sequel in the Transporter franchise obeys all of the rules of sequels ? bigger budget , bigger death count , more gloss , and at least one more lingerie-clad hottie with two hand-held machine guns . It's otherwise exactly the same movie as the original , with a few negligible plot modifications . What isn't changed is the ready-made action movie premise , this time using such an old action cliché that the first thing I thought of was those little sponge-things I used to make my mom buy me when I was a kid . You put a drop of water on it and in a couple minutes it turns into a dinosaur or something . But beyond the just-add-water instant action movie beginning , it at least ultimately proves to be another example of the over-the-top action extravaganza that the series has come to be known for . The movie works because it knows not to take itself seriously , and while this prohibits it from anyone in the audience being in danger of taking anything seriously , it doesn't stop it from being fun . There is a scene in the movie where Frank notices a bomb strapped to the underside of his car , and when I saw the way he managed to dislodge it I laughed out loud , and not necessarily in a bad way . You will laugh too , but there is a distinct feeling that you're laughing with the movie and not at it , and that right there is exactly what makes it fun . Frank Martin has been doing some chauffeuring duties for the wealthy Billings family ? Jefferson , who works in drug control for the government , and his estranged wife Audrey - and ends up making an unlikely friendship with their 6-year-old son Jack . But don't worry , the unlikeliness of that friendship very soon looks very normal when compared to the rest of the plot developments . Jack is kidnapped by a stereotypical Colombian villain and his henchmen , which include his statuesque blonde girlfriend ( who spends the entire movie wearing nothing but skimpy lingerie and a ton of eyeshadow ) and a bunch of meathead henchmen . So get this , the villain , like me , is Colombian , so of course he's hell-bent on flooding the world with cocaine , but wait until you hear his plan ! His scheme is to infect Jack with a deadly airborne virus that will in turn infect anyone who comes into contact with him . They don't want a ransom , they hand the kid back with amazingly little resistance . But Jefferson is soon attending a conference with lots of high-level officials involved in the U . S . drug control infrastructure . You see where this is going ? I hope so , because while the plot is actually a little more complex than you would expect from a movie like this , it doesn't slow down for very long to give you time to think about anything , which I suppose is just as well . It moves frantically from one action set piece to the next , balancing out the preposterous action sequences with greater emotional involvement than the original movie in the relationship between Jack and Frank . But when it comes down to it , The Transporter 2 is exactly the same thing as the original movie . It has all the same ingredients but in slightly different quantities , so your opinion of the first movie is going to give you a much better idea of how you'll like the second one than any review is going to . Then again , something tells me that a good portion of the Transporter target audience aren't big readers , so maybe I'm wasting my time here anyway ? Nah , I'm just kidding . That'll be my bad joke for the day . But regardless of the reading habits of the Transporter fan club , I don't need to explain to you that this is not an intelligent action movie . It's a super-fast action thriller with stunts that would make James Bond nervous and a lot of people shooting each other up , but I would be lying if I said it wasn't entertaining ?
544110	562732	1114740	7.0	Fun for security guards and civilians alike !	Shortly into Paul Blart : Mall Cop , I was struck by a sudden realization that I wasn't sure if the movie was making fun of all security guards or just the ones that take their jobs too seriously . In pondering that question , I realized that the fun-poking that the movie does could wreak devastating havoc on the rent-a-cop industry in the United States . Can you imagine the terror if it suddenly became cool for security guards to slack off on the job ? I don't even want to think about it . The next thing I did was mourn the sad fate of the Segway , which was introduced to the public back in 2001 and was intended ( and many people believed it would ) to completely redefine the way we travel within cities and even design the cities themselves . It's easy to have believed that , too . Merely a year into the 21st century , the realization that flying cars remain distantly in the future ( or , more likely , forever limited to fiction ) paves the way for a strong belief that the futuristic vision of 21st century Americans that we have been waiting for might be something as simple as this curious little vehicle on which Americans of the future must soon be zooming around on . 8 years later , however , the Segway remains wildly over-priced and conspicuously absent from the general public . At most it's a curious oddity occasionally glimpsed in public , popping up more often as a sight gag in movies like Paul Blart or Ron Howard's brilliant televisions series " Arrested Development " than as an everyday means of transportation . And it's use on-screen is doing nothing to improve it's public image ! Paul Blart is a mall security guard who believes that his job is not only on par with a police officer , but even a member of the military . He zooms importantly around the mall on his Segway , calling codes and status updates into his shoulder radio even as his superiors sit in the main security office teasing him for being so serious . Paul is a lovable guy but the movie tries so hard to get us to laugh not only at his dead - serious attitude about his low-profile job but also at his weight and hypoglycemia issues that it becomes nearly impossible to accept his budding romance with a local hair-extensions salesgirl . Kevin James , of " King of Queens " fame , is a wonderful comedic actor who brings back fond memories of John Candy , but most of the movie hangs from him like a wet blanket . I do appreciate , however , that the movie attempts to get us to laugh without a single sex joke or body noise or any other such nonsense , and it's not overflowing with pointless profanity like so many other low-brow comedies these days . The action and romance are both thoroughly ridiculous , as are the bad guys who take over the mall ( with an intricate plot to steal , I kid you not , credit card numbers ) and then race around it on skateboards and BMX bikes , , but it's important to realize that the movie is a fun romp around a barricaded mall , sort of like what you would get if you combined Dawn of the Dead , Die Hard , and Home Alone , and removed any possibilities of zombies or bloodshed . Home Alone , for example , was gorier than this movie . And besides , it also features the funniest Indian accent since the 1986 classic Short Circuit . Peanut Blart and jelly !
544687	562732	292291	7.0	Painfully funny !	Bean's hilariously complex alarm clock ( which he still manages to shut off in his sleep ) and his changing clothes in the car on the way to the dentist are classic Bean moments ( they remind me of the scene in the Bean movie where he makes a cup of coffee in his mouth ) , especially when he brushes his teeth and rinses his mouth with the windshield wiper fluid . Hilarious ! The scene in the comic book store illustrates one of Bean's most enduring charms , that he is basically a child stuck in a man's body . He plays with a teddy bear , loves comic books , and is genuinely excited by the most childish things . Unlike a child , however , he proves himself remarkably adept with a dentist's drill in this episode ( after inadvertently rendering the dentist unconscious , since he just couldn't help fiddling with all those shiny tools ) . The drill sound was a little too realistic for me ! And there is also a clever scene where he tries to fix a kid's remote control boat and ends up setting the frequency so that he controls the boat and also a nearby wheelchair carrying a little old lady . The picnic scene with the pesky fly or wasp of whatever overdid the sound effects a little but still had its fun moments . This is not classic Bean , but still fun , as always .
543875	562732	62512	7.0	Good action , as well as one of the better stories in the Bond series .	What you have in You Only Live Twice is Sean Connery back as James Bond , and he is basically trying to prevent the outbreak of World War III , which later becomes a very common theme in Bond films . It seems that there is some sort of mysterious space craft in the Earth's atmosphere that swallows up orbiting , manned spacecraft , instigating accusations on the planet below . At first , the USA got a ship swallowed , and accused the Russians , informing them that another ship would be put into orbit within a month and if anything happened , it would be considered an act of war . The situation is complicated when the Russians also send a ship into orbit that gets swallowed . Obviously , Britain disagrees from the beginning that the Russians were involved , given the object's landing point ( the Sea of Japan area ) , and they send one of their agents ( Bond , of course ) to the vicinity to investigate . In this installment , Bond actually gets an edge on the enemy because they think he's dead . In the beginning of the film , he is shot in bed in a scheme to fake his own death , hence the title of the movie . While You Only Live Twice has one of the more interesting stories of the Bond films , it also has some of the most outlandish situations . Some mad scientist seems to have built himself a secret lair in a volcano , from which he launches this mysterious object into space , with the objective of causing a war between the United States and Russia . It's the old ' take over the world ' theme , and it really doesn't work very well here . Obviously , Blofeld , the madman villain bent on world domination , was the subject of the majority of Dr . Evil's look from the Austin Powers films . The outfit , the scar down the side of the face , and of course , the ever-present cat , which Blofeld strokes constantly in true Dr . Claw form . Donald Pleasance , who is entirely unrecognizable as Michael Meyers ' psychologist in John Carpenter's horror classic Halloween , makes a very good villain in this installment , even if his motives are clichéd and questionably sought . Also notice the irony that Pleasance was a main character in that movie , in which he struggled to kill the murderous Michael Meyers , and then 30 years later , his look in You Only Live Twice is copied by a hilarious comedian named Mike Myers , in a film that begins in the same year this film was made ! While a great many of the situations of this film are highly unlikely ? particularly those that deal with Blofeld's lair as well as his seemingly infinite power ? You Only Live Twice is still one of the more interesting Bond films and , of course , it does star Sean Connery , who is by far the best Bond . On a trivial note , this is one of the few Bond films in which he never introduces himself in his infamous way ( ' Bond . James Bond . ' ) . We get virtually the exact same ending as we saw in the excellent Dr . No , which suggests a need for some innovative scriptwriting , but the film still entertains , despite it many excesses . Not nearly among the best , but this is still signature Bond material .
544888	562732	408790	7.0	Little Girl Julia .	Flightplan is a taut psychological thriller that very nearly earns its description as Hitchcockian , there are plenty of similarities and even specific shots that are very Hitchcockian ( the shot of the crows flying away at the beginning of the film , for example ) , but there are times when the movie almost falls apart in the third act . Thrillers have a tendency to fall on their faces as soon as it's revealed what's actually going on , but this movie at least has real reasons for things like why Kyle Pratt ( Jodie Foster ) just happens to be an airline engineer and knows her way around the plane when her daughter turns up missing , it was explained how things were pulled off by those responsible , etc , and not even in the Scooby-Doo ending kind of way . But when you find out what's happening , it almost turns into your standard , run of the mill kidnapping thriller , and even the ones that take place on airplanes have been overdone already . In the movie's defense , however , it is brilliantly cast . Jodie Foster established herself as a parent not to be messed with in Little Man Tate in 1991 and then reiterated in spectacular fashion in Panic Room a decade or so later . Even more importantly , there are also plenty of suspects to keep you guessing ? Sean Bean , no stranger to bad guy roles , Peter Sarsgaard , for the same reason , the terrorists ( whose suspicions were thankfully toned down from earlier versions of the script , but who still exchange mysterious glances with other Arabs when they are first approached ) , any members of the crew , etc . Where the movie really fails is in deliberately leading the audience in one direction simply to hide what's coming . The two guys looking into Julia's room at the beginning of the film ( and Kyle's realization later that the strange Arab guy on the plane was one of them and that's why she though she recognized him ) . More importantly , the movie fails logistically . On paper I'm sure the idea of this kind of story worked really well , but you have to consider the person that would plan out a scheme this meticulously that could hinge on something like the need to get a woman and her daughter onto a plane with more than 400 other passengers , and have not a single person notice her enough to be able to say later that she boarded with a little girl and not alone . Also , they may have been able to avoid deploying the entire Newfoundland police force and military had they checked the surveillance tapes at the airport to see whether or not Kyle actually had a little girl with her when she got on the plane . So while close scrutiny of the story reveals enough plot holes to drive a whole fleet of two - story , E-474's through , it is still a taut thriller that is wildly entertaining for the first half and still remains satisfactory after the mystery element is bluntly removed . Jodie Foster delivers a powerful performance , almost too powerful for the rest of the movie to handle , and six-year - old Marlene Lawston is stunningly convincing as her daughter . Her traumatized performance in the first part of the film is just astonishing . All of that being said , I suppose I look back with some degree of disappointment in the movie because it had so many simple but glaring flaws and plot holes , but while I was watching it I think I went through about five or six pounds of popcorn and I loved it . As for thrillers these days , there are definitely better ones than this , but there are far more worse ones than better .
544537	562732	3758	7.0	Entertaining short comedy by Charlie Chaplin that foreshadows a major theme of his later films .	Unfortunately , Caught In A Cabaret , being one of Chaplin's earliest films , has deteriorated pretty badly over the last nine decades or so , and this deterioration seems to have affected the film's continuity , making it look like the editing is botched . As is the case with most of Chaplin's films , the action in Caught In A Cabaret runs slightly faster than real life , which enhances much of the slapstick comedy but also makes several short clips in the film go by so fast that they are virtually incomprehensible . ( spoilers ) The main theme of Caught In A Cabaret deals with rich vs . poor , a theme that Chaplin later became famous for and which he made use of so often because of his own poverty stricken childhood . This film concerns a working man who pretends to be someone else in order to get accepted into a group of wealthy people . It is not expected that at the end he does not get the girl and winds up walking down a dirt road alone , but his activities throughout the film make his point clear . As he is at a party with the rich people , he gets drunk and makes something of a fool of himself , but when he is working as a waiter , he is fairly heroic , ridding the place of unwanted ruffians and whatnot . Caught In A Cabaret has not survived too well physically , but it is an excellent example of the type of early work Chaplin did as he became famous as one of the most loveable characters in cinematic history .
544710	562732	240772	8.0	Hell yes .	The remake of Ocean's 11 is a tremendously entertaining movie . I personally find Brad Pitt and George Clooney to be among the most watchable actors working today , so I found the movie to be hugely appealing despite numerous plot holes , an almost nonstop barrage of clichés , a ridiculous ending , and Don Cheadle . Before I go on , I should mention that I think Cheadle is an immensely talented actor with some great performance's under his belt , such as his work in Boogie Nights , Traffic , and A Lesson Before Dying ( sure , he can't pronounce Vladivostok , but it was still a great performance ) . The problem with his character here , probably the most controversial role of the entire movie , is that he was forced to take on this ridiculous accent , making him the Jar Jar Binks of Ocean's 11 . Pretty sad , but I hope it serves as a lesson for how dumb it is to have well known actors take on thick accents . It does nothing but call attention to itself and invite criticism for the actor's ability to pull it off . And given the content of the discussion boards on the IMDb , Cheadle didn't pull it off so well . That being said , the rest of the movie is enormously entertaining , even though Andy Garcia , who I have had an unjustifiable aversion to ever since Desperate Measures , turns his character of the ridiculously rich Terry Benedict , owner of three casinos in Las Vegas , into an almost cartoonish villain . George Clooney plays the title character Danny Ocean , recently released from prison where he had plenty of time to develop intricate plots for robbing three casinos simultaneously . The parole board asks him if he thinks he would ever return to a life of crime were he released , he smiles , gets released , and promptly returns to a life of crime . This is the kind of character that Clooney was born to play . Brad Pitt plays Ocean's Second , the second man in charge and much of the pull behind getting this whole thing together . We get the usual montage of hilarious antics being committed by those that are to be sought to be among Ocean's 11 ( edited together on the same template used to introduce us to the colorful characters in Armageddon ) , each one fulfilling the need for another stereotype . In this way , the movie is pretty weak , but it is so entertaining to watch the robberies pulled off that it makes up for a lot of these shortcomings . Brad Pitt lends his massive presence to the film as Rusty , an old friend of Danny's . Rusty is an interesting character , sort of a freelancer in Vegas , living his life in the casinos , obviously raking in comfortable amounts of cash from his less than legal endeavors , and willing only to dress in the highest of fashion . Strange , however , for a man to constantly wear such high priced clothing when he is ALWAYS eating . Matt Damon plays the part of the pickpocket , whose skills come into good use in the plot in ways which I will not reveal , Don Cheadle plays the demolitions expert , Bernie Mac gets a great role as a card dealer with a not so clean past , and Elliott Gould makes a huge turn from his character in American History X to play the part of a washed up con man , eager for revenge against Terry Benedict , who put him out of business . The idea is to rob the central safe that stores the cash for the three casinos in question . Supposedly this is the most ingenious and impenetrable vault ever created by mankind ( as this is generally how it is described throughout the movie ) , which begs the question of why the blueprints for the vault are kept under the watchful eye of a cheaply rented night security guard . That's like leaving the keys to Fort Knox in plain view outside the vault and protected by a thin pane of glass . ( spoilers ) Complicating matters , conveniently for the script , is the little factoid that Benedict is now dating Ocean's ex-wife , who left him because he was involved in a life of crime . It's interesting to see the movie take place in what is to me the familiar setting of Las Vegas , but it is not enough to distract attention from the disastrous romantic content of the movie . Not only does Tess ( Roberts ) come off as a stiff and exceedingly unpleasant woman , but she left Danny in the first place for being a criminal and landing himself in prison . Then he pulls off this astronomical heist , stealing millions and millions of dollars from her current love interest ( as well as managing to get him to admit on camera that he cares more about money than he does about Tess ) , and THEN she wants him back . What , she didn't want to be with him before because his criminal life landed him in prison , but now she wants him back because he's GOOD at being a criminal ? Please . Nevertheless , while the ending almost completely ruined the movie because it leaves such a bad aftertaste , the rest of the film is hugely entertaining , bad fake accents notwithstanding . There are lots of twists and turns , lots of people get what is coming to them , and as is to be expected from a movie starring Brad Pitt , George Clooney , Matt Damon and Julia Roberts , the star power is substantial . It ends badly , but it's great up to that point . It's just too bad that the bad part is so near the end and therefore in the front of your mind at the end of the movie .
544724	562732	338348	8.0	The true meaning of Christmas is in your heart ?	I read a review by another IMDb user who compared the look of the film to illustrations in old children's books , the ones that , for certain generations , bring back warm and much - cherished memories , and while The Polar Express didn't exactly knock my socks off like I expected it would , this is exactly what it looks like , and that kind of aesthetic appeal can go a long way . The story involves an urgent Christmas time emergency . A young boy lies quietly in his bed on Christmas Eve , as the story begins , and pores over doubts in his mind about the existence of Santa Claus . Enter The Polar Express , a magical train designed for just such an emergency . The conductor , in the film's defining moment , calmly urges the astonished boy , " I think you should get on the train . " There are definite roller coaster moments which , for all of the movie's thematic cleverness , remind us periodically that this is meant to be a good ride , thrilling us with the stomach - turning train travel as much as with the brilliant animation and entirely new form of acting . This new kind of acting and animation is done through something that I believe is called performance capture , where the actors really act out the scenes that they are in , and using a gigantic number of sensors placed over the actor's face and body , the performance is then entered into the computer , and Tom Hanks can be turned into a whole host of characters in the same movie . I believe he plays five parts in this movie . What I love about the movie is that it doesn't give us a sugary confection when we get to the North Pole . Santa is not jolly old St . Nick here , he's a businessman with a lot of employees . Tiny employees , but also not cute little elves either . Even the reindeer look like real animals , that grunt and snort and , gasp , may even have bodily functions ! There were some points where I felt that the character of the conductor was a little too abrasive , even mean . I appreciate that the movie doesn't shoot for your traditional Christmas movie , opting instead to add some excitement and even be a little scary , but at some times the effort to do this became a little transparent and we get something where the conductor just comes off as a jerk . Then again , I should mention that it is ironically because of things like this that the movie is so watchable , and re-watchable . I've heard some people worry about what this new method of capturing performances will mean in the future ( I know that some people are , for some reason , worried that actors will some day literally be able to " phone-in " their performances ) , although that doesn't exactly strike me as a valid concern . It seems like an addition to the art , rather than a corruption . Either way , it's a pretty exciting ride !
544257	562732	274546	8.0	In a time when horror movies have become direct-to-video crap or cheesy first-run crap , how is it that the Hellraiser movies are among the least noticed and yet probably the most clever and impressive sequel	The beginning of the fifth Hellraiser sequel raises something of a moral dilemma , which is extremely rare for a horror movie . After the car crash , Trevor , our hero , escapes from the car after it sinks to the bottom of the river and he rushes to the surface to get air , then returns to attempt to save his wife . At that point , my immediate reaction was that he deserves any suffering that comes to him , since he left his wife on the bottom of the river to go and try to save himself . On the other hand , it probably wouldn't have done much good had he remained down there and lost consciousness right there with her . I guess that's why they tell you on the airlines to secure your own oxygen mask and THEN help your kid . But while this early scene inspired in me an unusually complex combination of thoughts and emotions , it unfortunately is unable to escape from the destructive presence of reality on the possibility of it happening the way it did . I am willing to suspend disbelief on the premise that the guy was screaming at his wife underwater through the window , watching her drown right in front of his blurred eyes and therefore not necessarily able to think all that clearly , but on the other hand , riverbeds have an overwhelming tendency to be covered with big , round , hard , window-breaking rocks . When the investigation begins , things start to get a little strange and we begin to realize that there is something weird about what happened in that crash . Evidently the car was found with the doors open , which puts some serious holes in the story about not being able to get the doors open to save his wife . It turns out that he has come back with a spotted memory , and that the crash that we saw at the beginning of the movie may not have been exactly how the event unfolded . Things seem to have happened that he doesn't remember . I found it highly amusing that the detective that always gave him a hard time because he didn't believe his story was named Detective Gibbons , just because I recently took an Anthropology class in which I learned what a ' gibbon ' is . I would NOT have been able to keep my cool with this guy though , who was hugely overacting and throwing harsh accusations which were not necessarily unfounded but definitely a little too confident and , if accusations can be this , a little too accusatory . The best thing about this installment in the Hellraiser series is that it works on a psychological level with the main character . Granted , this is nothing new in the horror genre , but it is done very well here . We never know when he is seeing reality , when he's dreaming , when he's having delusions , inaccurate flashbacks , and there is plenty of opportunity for lots of twists and turns , and thankfully these opportunities are not ignored . I hate it when movies do that ( see Hollow Man ) . Because of this , we never expect things like the startlingly effecting scare in the vending machine , one of my favorite scares in the movie . Pinhead has thankfully been given a much more prevalent role than he had in the rather disappointing Hellraiser Inferno , the least Hellraiser movie of all of them , and it's morbidly pleasing to see some of the familiar Cenobites return , like Chatterer . The movie closes with the old ' leave him and take me ' cliché , but as a whole it is a quality entry in the Hellraiser saga . It is well-written , well-thought out ( almost unheard of for a horror movie these days ) , and entertaining , and most importantly , it is more than just another cash in on a successful series . There are a lot of horror series ' that are well past their time to pass away , but as long as they keep putting this much thought and creativity into the Hellraiser films , I say there is infinite opportunity for sequels .
544619	562732	303350	8.0	The poor kid would have dealt with the ordeal with the dog a lot better had he read Call of the Wild .	Then again , of course , the whole point was that he was a poor black kid , pretty much a slave to the rich white man who doesn't exactly prepare him for the University . I just couldn't help remember how vicious the beatings were that the sled dogs suffered in that book . The story focuses initially on a rich white man who takes a puppy away from a young boy , puts the dog into a burlap sack and proceeds to kick him viciously , because " the dog must learn . " There is some room for individual interpretation of that statement , but the overwhelming fact is that the man forces the boy to open the sack to let the dog out , and the boy worries because he knows that the dog will think that it was him doing the kicking . It's difficult to say whether this technique was more to subordinate the boy or to turn the puppy into a working dog that will be useful on the farm as well as useful as a watchdog when it grows into a full sized dog , but I get the feeling that they are both the goals of this repulsive practice . The film transcends the rather limited and immediate lesson of the dangers of abusing those under you and comes off to me as more of a life lesson of the extended effects that your actions can have . This process of claiming and maintaining power over the boy and the dog combined to cost the man his life and the boy his best friend . It's odd that the tagline listed on the IMDb says that ultimately both of their lives hang in the balance at the mercy of the dog , because other than not being able to get his master's medicine to him , his life was really not in any danger . I guess he was his master , anyway . But the only way the boy's life was in danger was if he depended on the man to the point where the man's death would mean he was going to starve to death . The dog thought he was protecting his master and would not have attacked the boy unless he tried to approach the man . This is a pretty powerful film , and while I think the message itself is not exactly lightning out of a clear sky for unexpectedness , it is delivered with a richness and clarity that should be praised , especially in such a short film .
544427	562732	298408	8.0	" I'd much rather be in here than out there in that cold world . . . "	It has taken me years to get around to watching Laurel Canyon , even after having lived in Los Angeles and worked in West Hollywood for a year and a half . There is more about the southern California lifestyle to dislike than can ever be explained in less than 1 , 000 words , and this movie takes on really just a tiny , tiny part of it , but it paints a picture of show business life clashing with ' normal ' life that matches the reality that I experienced there with astonishing accuracy . Of course , a lot of the effect comes from the location shooting . Anyone from Los Angeles will instantly recognize many of the locations , particularly things like the Château Marmont hotel ( where , incidentally , Lindsay Lohan lived for months and months in 2006 while she couldn't seem to stop partying enough to find a real apartment ) and , more importantly , that charming cafe at the corner of Laurel Canyon and Kirkwood Drive , where I often used to go for coffee . Jim Morisson's house , a few feet away , is sadly overlooked , which is strange since the movie is about the hectic world behind the scenes of the music industry . Christian Bale plays the part of Sam , a young professional , a psychiatrist already tired of his profession and struggling to start a life with his young wife , Alex . Kate Beckinsale is the perfect embodiment of a young bride horrified by the debauchery taking place around her , as she and Sam move into his mother's house to find , to their dismay , that she has not moved out as promised , but is still there recording music with some dirty , stoned musicians . It is truly remarkable how flawlessly Francisc McDormand fits into the role of the aging mother still stuck in a rock star lifestyle . She is truly one of our most versatile actors ! While the relationship between Sam and Alex is realistic and convincing enough ( especially Sam's dismay at bringing Alex around his mother , and his clearly desperate need not to displease her - note the way he looks at her when he declines his mother's offer of a drink . . . ) , but the mother-son relationship is not believable in the slightest . But this , however , is not something that I think the movie is shooting for . This is not a family drama , it's a comparison of different lifestyles , sort of a peek into the craziness of show business life juxtaposed with everyday American society ( the educated kind , at least ) , and how completely different and unmixable they are . Unmixable ? Is that a word ? Anyway , you get the idea . Water and oil . It's nearly impossible to imagine a smart , well-balanced young man entering his career as a psychiatrist having come from the environment that Jane ( McDormand ) would have provided him during childhood , but the situational drama that comes from their relationship is revelatory about both lifestyles . The actual neighborhoods and the style of the houses in that part of Hollywood are presented perfectly , thanks in no small part to the location shooting , but it also captures the attitude in many ways as well . I will say that I found the ending to be a bit sudden , but if nothing else , it's one of those movies that makes you think . You may find yourself imagining one lifestyle or the other , and comparing your own thoughts to how the people in the movie were living . It makes you think , and while I found some scenes and situations a little too far of a stretch ( Sam's fascination with the darker lifestyle is interesting , but getting involved sexually with her husband's mother ? Yeah RIGHT . . . ) , it's still an interesting and well-written drama .
544900	562732	458525	8.0	" Looks like we're gonna need new sheets again , baby ? "	It is perfectly fitting that the new X-Men movie should include " Wolverine " in the title , since none of the three previous movies explained the history of his mutation , although slightly less fitting that " X-Men " should be in the title , because it is more like a spin off for Wolverine , the franchise's most popular character , than it is another X-Men movie . Granted , the histories of some of the other X-Men that we know are mentioned , such as Sabertooth , who is the result of Wolverine's brother Victor evolving along darker lines , and Cyclops also shows up , but for the most part we get Wolverine growing to understand his mutation as he is put into a team with a whole new group of mutants . Not that that's a bad thing , of course . Die hard fans may not be so pleased to see that so little of the new movie has to do with the mutants that we know so far , and while my own knowledge of the comic books is absolute zero , I'm going to go ahead and suggest that the new movie is enjoyable even though it almost certainly doesn't live up to the expectations of the comic-thumping crowd . The movie opens in northwestern Canada in 1840 . Wolverine ( now just Jimmy ) and his brother Victor witness the brutal killing of their father which is almost exactly the same as the killing of young Rory Devaney's father in The Devil's Own , except for one crucial difference . You'll know it when you see it . It's a moment that comes dangerously close to an homage joke , but the recovery is thankfully quick . Their Canadian citizenship makes for a great scene late in the film that will have Canadian movie theaters erupting with cheers , although it doesn't explain why Jimmy and Victor fight side by side in the Civil War , World War I , World War II , and Vietnam which , unless I'm sorely mistaken , are mostly all more American wars than Canadian . Nevertheless , it's one of the movie's many great sequences . Anyway , in Vietnam things get a little crazy . Victor loses his cool and has a confrontation with a senior officer that results in the death of one of them , and when a firing squad fails to kill them , they are offered a position on board a super-secret black Ops team so they can REALLY serve their country . Well , they can serve their neighbors to the south , anyway . What follows is Jimmy's journey to find a place in the world for himself , and all along the way he has to avoid being used for powers that he has but doesn't even fully understand yet , and he discovers a major project headed by William Stryker ( Danny Huston ) , who is secretly planning to capture all of the mutants ' powers and create a single super-mutant with the powers of all of them and , presumably , none of their weaknesses . A lot of action tension falls away as it becomes more and more apparent that the relevant mutants , particularly Wolverine , are immune not only to death but to injury , but the entertainment level is high and the effects and photography are generally pretty good . There is some pretty disappointing blue-screen work late in the film in it's ambitious climactic scene , although to be completely honest , I was forced to watch a pirated DVD that I bought last week here in China that had 13 other movies on it . The picture quality is of course reduced , but more importantly , somehow someone got their hands on a copy of the movie where a lot of the visual effects weren't even finished , like external shots of planes flying and mostly the entire final scene . There was actually one point where Victor puts his hand on a window and a text label pops up saying " claws grow . " I'm assuming that in the final version , his claws grew menacingly . For those of you with access to American theaters , I hope you appreciate the sheer picture quality that you are able to experience , you don't know what you're not missing ! X-Men : Origins is not the best X-Men movie ( I would argue that X2 was the best so far ) and it's a strange choice for director Gavin Hood , whose directing efforts include the hugely impressive 2005 film Tsotsi and 2007's Rendition . He has definitely hit the big time with this movie ( like Alfonso Cuaron did when he was asked to direct Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban ) , although it seems like fans of his directing will be unimpressed with his latest choice , but those of us who remember him acting in bad action and horror films like The Curse III and American Ninja 5 will be thrilled at how far he's come ! But even though a lot of fans and critics may not be as impressed with the latest X-Men film than past entries in the series ( Roger Ebert was pretty much a dick about the whole thing ) , X-Men : Origins is definitely a strong film considering that it's the third sequel . If they can keep them at least this good , they could easily squeeze out a couple more .
544610	562732	42707	8.0	Much better than expected !	As it is described in the collection in which it now appears , The Man Who Cheated Himself is definitely a classic piece of textbook film noir . I am embarrassed to say that I had never heard of Lee Cobb until I saw him in 12 Angry Men a couple months ago . He was an astonishingly busy actor between the 1930s and 1970s , appearing in more than 100 films and television shows . The video quality of the copy that I saw was not the best , the picture was unclear and scratched and the sound was like an old vinyl record , but I watched the movie expecting to see a stunningly bad old movie , given that I bought it in a collection of something like 15 movies , most of which seem to have been long since forgotten . I will admit that I didn't feel a lot of chemistry between Cobb's police chief Cullen and Lois Frazer , Jane Wyatt's femme fatale , but I was willing to accept it as a catalyst to propel the plot and their fates further down the tubes . There is a definite effort to generate Hitchcockian suspense during the middle portion of the film as their cover story grows thinner and thinner . I have read some reviewers that disagree , but I think that this part of the film is done particularly well , given that it is so realistic . The process is complicated by the fact that the other lead investigator on the murder is Cullen's younger brother , who grows continually closer and closer to the truth , which he desperately doesn't want to be true , while Cobb's Cullen has more and more often to talk down to him as though he's a rookie , telling him he is naïve and inexperienced when , in fact , he is doing everything right . ( spoilers ) The chase sequence at Fort Point at the base of the Golden Gate Bridge is the best part of the film , although for some reason it seems like it is dragged out a bit , as if they wanted to get as much out of their access to the site as possible , yet the scene was barely five minutes long . I have visited Fort Point many times when I was a kid and lived in the Bay Area , and I seem to remember a rather eccentric portrayal of it in Bicentennial Man , but this is clearly a much more interesting and successful use of it in a film , at least until Kim Novak threw herself into the Bay here in 1958 . The very end of The Man Who Cheated Himself is a little confusing to me . The plot is clear and the ending is perfect , although I can't understand the half smile on Cullen's ( Cobb's ) face as he sees Lois walk by with her new lawyer boyfriend , whom she is entrusting to ensure her freedom almost as a trade for her love , as Cullen is led away to his miserable fate . Maybe he simply can't believe what has happened . The movie has a definite B-movie feel ( not the least reason for which is Wyatt's uninspired performance ) but it is well written and otherwise well made .
544196	562732	805570	8.0	Models and Boy Scouts advised to avoid riding subways alone after 2am ?	It is one of my unwritten principles about film criticism never to say things like " Such-and - such movie could only have come from the mind of so-and-so . " It's a self-congratulatory phrase that sell-out critics ( film critics and books critics alike ) use in efforts to get their names on movie or book covers , and having been a fan of writers like Clive Barker and Stephen King since I was about 11 years old , I've heard it more than enough times for it to have become an empty cliché in my mind . Nevertheless , The Midnight Meat Train , my friends , could only have come from the mind of Clive Barker . Sorry about that . It has been probably something like 15 years since I read Barker's Books of Blood , and pretty much the only thing I remembered very clearly from The Midnight Meat Train were the creatures on the train and that thing with the tongue at the end of the story . That's an image that won't leave your mind easily ! I also recommend reading " The Skins of the Fathers " and " The Body Politic , " the latter of which was featured in the disappointing film Quicksilver Highway . Bradley Cooper stars as Leon , young photographer desperate to earn the recognition of a local famous artist named Susan Hoff . Unfortunately , his main technique is the gigantic cliché of trying to " capture the city as it really is , " which has to be the most uninteresting goal imaginable for any photographer . Maybe he doesn't understand for how many decades that exact same thing has been pursued by countless tens of thousands of photographers . As is to be expected , Susan is unimpressed and wants something more , so Leon soon finds himself perusing the late-night subways trying to catch the perfect stills of violent crimes in progress . He discovers a man who has a habit of riding the last train past the last stop and butchering the remaining subway inhabitants like cattle , and Leon becomes obsessed with getting to the bottom of the crimes , only to discover that this particular series of murders has a history that can be traced back well over a century . The movie is padded pretty heavily , of course , given that it's adapted from a short story , but for the most part it stays true to the original tale . Mostly , certain things are fleshed out a lot more , characters are added , and other side elements are added completely , but the disturbing heart of the story is here . We could easily have done without Leon's atrocious girlfriend , however . She has to be the whiniest , most self-righteous and controlling woman that I've seen in a movie in years . They are meant to be getting married soon , and when Leon photographs an attempted gang-rape in progress and then the victim later goes missing ( and the police don't believe anything is really going on ) , his girlfriend is not for one second supportive or interested or even concerned , she simply instructs him not to take night photography anymore . She informs him that he is to turn in his photos to the police and move on . She also has an emotional scene in the second half of the movie that is such a preposterously bad piece of acting that it made me want to throw myself in front of a meat train ! As a horror movie it works surprisingly well . There is at least one shot that I've never seen done in any horror movie , and I've been a pretty avid horror fan for nearly two decades . Unfortunately , there are also more than a few scenes that simply make no sense whatsoever . Mahogany , the " butcher " ( played by Vinnie Jones ) has bloody gastric problems that are never really quite explained , although the more distracting aberration is his bizarre outbreak of marble-sized moles or warts that covers his chest , which he routinely cuts off with a scalpel and collects in jars in his medicine cabinet . It's a satisfactorily horrible affliction , to be sure , but it would have been nice if it hadn't just been thrown in randomly for effect . I was also a little confused by the Asian hottie that gets assaulted near the beginning of the movie . She nearly gets gang-raped by a group of gangsters , is barely saved , and proceeds to get on the subway alone anyway . It was weird enough that she was riding the subway home alone in the middle of the night anyway ( she's a MODEL , by the way ) , but man , she sure made a quick recovery from the attack ! Later , a group of kids are walking through the subway selling fund-raiser candy bars at 2am . I hope they get a dedication merit badge for that ! The movie is shot in a properly metallic blue that permeates just about every shot of the movie , never letting you forget that you're looking at a series of horror movie sets , but this is still leaps and bounds better than the vast majority of horror movies being heaved into theaters these days . It has buckets and buckets of gore and so will definitely satisfy the gore-hounds , but it has an interesting story which prevents it from coming off as a stupid , mindless orgy of violence , like Eli Roth's head-smackingly stupid film Hostel . The thing that I have always appreciated about Clive Barker's stories ( and Stephen King's ) is that the better ones are not just scary movies , they have something of what Freud called the " uncanny . " They tell stories of familiar things , familiar objects , but cast them in a light and place them in surroundings that make them off-putting on a level that lesser horror films can't even begin to aspire to . So even when the CGI blood effects are laughably bad , the arc of the story is taking us somewhere so different than what we're used to that it's pretty easy to overlook . For horror fans , this is a definite must-see .
544014	562732	79817	8.0	Apollo's mad ?	So when Apollo says at the end of the first film that there isn't going to be any rematch ( sorry , " ain't gonna be no rematch " ) , I'm thinking that it was probably because no one really knew how big the movie was going to be . I think the original film was meant to be a single movie that stood on its own , but a sequel was squeezed out when it turned out to be a Best Picture winner , and since this first sequel was so good , it seems only natural that it should be followed by four more , right ? The movie starts off exactly where the original film left off . It even shows the last few minutes of the last film before continuing on to the hospital , where Creed's attitude has changed drastically . He is no longer telling Rocky that there will be no rematch , now he's so angry that he's demanding , from his wheelchair , that Rocky get up out of his own wheelchair right then and there and they'll finish the fight . Rocky , in his unique way , politely wonders what Apollo's so mad about , but ultimately they both go their separate ways in the hospital because , of course , neither can really stand up under their own power too well by this point . Rocky and Adrian are now married and shopping for a new house and a new life together using Rocky's winnings from his first fight with Apollo . But the money goes quickly , even though it was such a huge and commercially successful spectacle . You remember in the original film , for his amateur fights , his total prize money was something like $40 . Rocky brought home tens of thousands from the fight with Apollo , but he and Adrian bought a house and a car and various other essentials and soon found themselves again with little to no money and a whole list of new expenses . Rocky promised Adrian that he wouldn't fight anymore because she just can't handle the stress and the emotional trauma of watching her love getting battered all over the ring , so when Apollo begins publicly chastising Rocky for winning by freak chance and demanding that he face him again in the ring , Rocky has to grin and bear it even though he is forced to earn money doing janitorial work at the local boxing gym . The movie works because it plays on all the things about Rocky's personality that made us love him in the first place . A lesser film would have had the hero angrily fling his mop and bucket against the wall and get right up in Apollo's face , but Rocky is more devoted to his wife than to his public image , so he literally does grin and ignore the taunts and demands coming from Rocky , even though his life has become something so timid and moneyless . Adrian hears the demands and watches Rocky worriedly , afraid that he is going to give in to the pressure and endanger his safety again , but even though Rocky is tentatively interested in defending his reputation in the ring , it is more important to him to make his wife happy . But both are driven to the ring because Apollo has lost the respect of his fans , who think that he was paid to take a fall , and Rocky and Adrian are on their way to the poor house . It is one of the film's few week moments when she changes her mind and urges him to fight again , but the formula that we saw and loved from the first film comes back and it still works here . The only major drawback of the first Rocky sequel is that it is much , much too sappy . There are genuine emotional moments when Adrian falls into a coma after giving birth to their son , but mostly it is things like the army of thousands of children following Rocky completely parent-less as he goes on one of his famous training runs . I realize he's famous in Philadelphia now , but an endless crowd of children ? Come on ? The fight at the end of the movie fulfills a dream that was unfulfilled in the first movie , and some people will argue that it is unnecessary since , in some ways , it sort of negates the whole purpose of the first movie ending the way it did , but Rocky II is such a good movie that this doesn't seem to matter . The fight's not as well done as in the original film , for most of the time you may find yourself wondering why Rocky , from start to finish , doesn't block Apollo's punches at ALL , but it is no less exciting . In the world of sequels , this is definitely among the best ones . Oh and by the way , Rocky II was released the day after I was born !
544457	562732	734668	9.0	Houston , we have a problem . . .	In one of the simplest and yet most effective twilight zones , a passenger jet full of people unexpectedly accelerates to unheard of speeds and suddenly finds itself transported into the distant past . Time travel is one of the few endlessly entertaining storytelling premises , and although this story is presented almost entirely through dialogue , it is still one of the more vintage twilight episodes that I've seen . The first half of the episode is a little too simplistic , if only because we are trying to believe an airplane is travelling at thousands of knots , and yet there is not the slightest bit of vibration or noise in the cockpit . It looks more like they're sitting on the ground on a movie set , which they are . But when the time travel takes place , I have to think that it had some inspiration on some later time travel movies , most notably the Back to the Future films , given the acceleration to a certain speed and the rather violent shock that accompanies the , uh , temporal displacement , if you will . The payoff of the show is nothing more than a primitive go-motion dinosaur and some stock footage of the World's Fair in New York ( which gives it the feeling that the entire episode was made to fit around that aerial stock footage of the World's Fair like a raindrop around a bit of dust ) , but this is an excellent example of how a simple idea and some quality writing and performances can make for a highly entertaining half hour . Excellent !
544129	562732	734680	9.0	" I don't like what you're become . . . "	In what is one of the best episodes of the Twilight Zone that I've seen so far , Brian Aherne stars as Booth Templeton , an aging Broadway play actor unhappy with what his life has become . One day , after witnessing his trophy wife flagrantly galavanting with an attractive lodger half Templeton's age , he beings lamenting about his lost past , and soon finds himself transported back to it . Anytime I see time travel stories in movies or TV shows , one of the most interesting things to me is how the actual time travel is presented . In this case , it's not presented at all , Templeton literally walks out to the door to go to work , we go to commercial , and when we come back he's dropped off more than 30 years in the past , but this episode still has more layers of meaning than any other episode of the show I've seen so far . Templeton is understandably shocked to find himself transported into his past , and succumbs to the obvious desire to get alone with his wife who , at the time we had met Templeton at the beginning of the episode , had been dead for many years but remained very much alive in his memories . In one of the show's most interesting scenes , he and his lost wife get into an argument , leading him to tell her he doesn't like what she has become . What we in the audience know , and Templeton eventually figures out , is that it's not her that has become anything , it is him who has been changed by the decades that have passed since the last time they saw each other . It's an interesting analysis of how people change over the years , both from who they were when they were younger and , unfortunately often , from the person they have chosen as their life partner . We wonder how happy Templeton and this woman would be had she lived . Watch for Sydney Pollack in an early role as an obnoxious director , of all things , and for Adhere's revelation early in the show of the fact that he has no idea how to tie a necktie . Past and present become confused at the end of the episode , but it's still one that makes you think even more than most other . . .
544499	562732	472550	9.0	Like Dianne's , this one really adds to the story .	Of the three short plot hole videos included on the Shaun of the Dead DVD , Dianne's and Ed's add something new and unexpected to the story , while Shaun's simply illustrates what we already knew , while at the same time coming off as amusing and fun . Nick Frost narrates the brief and believable story of how he managed to , ah , survive the incoming onslaught of zombies from which Shaun and Liz barely escape . Granted , this is a zombie film , so the term " believable " has to be used in an entirely different way , but what I mean is that what happens in this little video fits with the rest of the story . And as with Dianne's story , there's a clever little joke in there at the end . Pretty fun stuff .
544763	562732	734541	9.0	Ah , to have had penicillin in the old west . . .	A family traveling west in hopes of striking it rich in a mysterious paradise that they've heard about called California suffers more and more every day , until they can think of nothing but the heat and thirst and sickness that they deal with on a daily basis . Serling gives us a pretty obvious story where he imagines what would have happened if one of those people traveling west all those years ago were to have been able to experience modern convenience for just one afternoon during that torturous journey . It's not the wildest stretch of the imagination as far as a story idea , but the entertainment is high and the performances are some of the best I've seen so far in the series . The couple in the diner hit the nail right on the head with their subdued reactions to the strange stranger's story , not sure to react with shock or to hide their surprise from someone who must be a little crazy . There's a cute twist at the end and an interesting paradox that calls your attention of the episode thus far into question , the time travel is not presented as anything more than simply walking over a sand bank , and the 100-years-in-the-future theme is done again the following week , but this is an excellent example of how good the twilight zone can be .
544568	562732	258100	9.0	Brilliant ! The funniest comedy since Dumb & Dumber !	Run , Ronnie , Run is a comedy with the rare distinction of having an excellently written script , especially since it was meant to sound dumb . Ronnie Dobbs is your typical beer guzzling redneck who can't seem to avoid getting himself arrested , and who always seems to have his elaborate arrests caught on film and broadcast on television . Some dumb guy is discovered through his unenviable skill of getting embarrassingly arrested , has a TV show created around his arrests , and becomes an instant star . Clearly , this is not Oscar material . In fact , a plot outline like that leads you to believe that it will be just another bonehead comedy in the moronic tradition of American Pie and Road Trip and Big Momma's House . However , Run , Ronnie , Run proves to be much more than any of those movies . Not only is it packed full of sidesplitting comedy , it is also presented in numerous unique ways . The film opens with an introduction by an elderly man whose vulgar speech prepares the audience for the sheer hilarity that is to follow . The rest of the movie is sparsely narrated by Clay , one of Ronnie's accident-prone friends who is the funniest redneck I've seen in a movie in years , besides Ronnie himself . David Cross delivers a hilarious performance in this film , and hopefully this movie will allow people to forgive him for his part in the pathetic Scary Movie 2 . As is necessary in a comedy like this , the dialogue is full of great comedy , but the thing that makes this movie unique is that it is not only hilarious but it's very well written . There are lots of very simple but very effective speech gags , like Ronnie's dim-witted comment to a police officer who was being excessively angry with a young kid ( who happened to be the officer's son ) , as well as his charming response to his stripper girlfriend ( one of the many products of his instant fame ) when her very presence doesn't manage to create the response that he hopes for in his ex . And by the way , it's just not the same to read all this in a review , you have to see this stuff for yourself . Not only is it more effective to see it all for yourself , but there is so much uproarious comedy in this movie that it is impossible to list it all in one review . Every character in this film is significant and well presented , and the movie never gets boring or slow . There are a couple of things that could have been left out , such as the Mary Poppins spoof about giving your woman a good old kick in the cnt , as well as the eventual fate of Clay , but even this childish and sometimes crude and grotesque humor is not enough to bring down the movie as a whole . This is a great comedy in the tradition of Dumb & Dumber , although I can't say that the movie actually manages to pass that one up as far as sheer quality . Even though there were a few things that were a little excessive or did not need to be in the movie , Run , Ronnie , Run is still a tremendously amusing and entertaining film . Every character in the film will have you cheering , and there is even one noteworthy scene where the town Mayor's fat , video game addicted son gets ped off and does something that will make every jaw in the audience drop . That's one of the best scenes in the film , and the irony is one of the things that made it such a good scene . I assure you that I am not exaggerating when I say that this is one of the best comedies to come along in years . It is so rare to see a comedy that is driven by the mishaps and misfortune of the uneducated ( and inbred ? ) that is able to overcome the simplicity of its content and come off as such a fulfilling and entertaining comedy . Definitely do not miss this one .
544657	562732	212338	9.0	Ben Stiller in a good movie ? ! There's a first time for everything .	Meet The Parents is an excellent comedy , despite the fact that the casting director was not the most brilliant person in the world . A lot of the material in the film was clichéd or simply not creative , such as the fact that Greg's ( Stiller ) luggage obviously got lost , but the film as a whole is an excellent and very entertaining comedy . Robert DeNiro is horribly miscast as the overprotective father , but he is such a good actor that he makes his performance in the role work very effectively . He didn't get to really be the startlingly effective tough guy that he is so famous for , but at least he was introduced in a domineering low angle shot , as he looks down at Greg and Pam from his bedroom window ( a very smart move by the film's director ) . Ben Stiller plays the part of the charmingly named Greg Focker , who wants to marry his girlfriend but has to earn the approval of her parents first . His name is bad enough , but he has to constantly explain his job as a nurse , a profession which provides him little to no respect from Pam's family . The majority of the film relates the events of the weekend spent at Pam's parents house , and everything imaginable goes wrong for him . The thing that makes this movie so funny is the well-written script and the way that some of the actors deliver their lines , particularly Robert DeNiro . The casting director deserves little to no credit for DeNiro's quality performance , but he just did such a good job in an uncharacteristic performance that he really steals the show . Some of the situations and especially the dialogue in this movie are destined to become classic lines ? ' Not many men in your profession , are there , Greg ? ' ' I have nipples , could you milk me ? ' And , of course , there is the hilarious way that DeNiro constantly calls Greg ' Focker ' or , in at least one instance , ' Greg R . N . ' Meet The Parents is a film that a surprisingly wide variety of people can enjoy . Meeting the parents is a part of relationships that the vast majority of men go through , and this can either be a smooth or devastating experience , so they can relate to what goes on in this film . Also , the point of view of the woman whose parents are being met is thoroughly presented , so the female audience will not feel left out at all . Even parents can enjoy this movie , because what parents don't worry about their kids and their dating experiences ? Some of the situations may go a little too far , I mean , it's not very often that an eligible bachelor meets his girlfriend's parents and nearly burns their house to the ground , and it's a little excessive that EVERYthing goes wrong , not just a lot of things , but the comedy is so good that these excessive things are okay . Ben Stiller is actually a good choice to play the role of Greg Focker , because he is such an annoying actor that it is very effective in the way that he gets all of Pam's family and friends to hate him . He makes a good scapegoat , and his unfortunate luck produces a good portion of the comedy in this film . But it is DeNiro , above all , who makes this such a good movie . He is cast strongly against type , but Meet The Parents is still a very well-made comedy that is just a lot of fun .
544858	562732	227445	9.0	The Score takes the age-old one-last-heist premise and makes it good again .	Edward Norton is one of the best actors working today , and Robert DeNiro and Marlon Brando are among the best film actors in history , so it is to be expected that a good film would result from a combined effort from all three of them . DeNiro plays Nick , a veteran break-in artist who is forced to do one last score before his plan to fade into blissfully obscure retirement with his clichéd girlfriend , and who doesn't like the entire set-up from the beginning . Norton plays the characters of Jack ( the man who investigated and set-up the heist from the beginning ) and Brian ( the man who works as a janitor at the building where the priceless scepter is kept , and who pretends to be mentally challenged to avoid drawing attention to himself ) . You can't help comparing these performances to his similar roles as Aaron and Roy in Primal Fear , which was Norton's second best performance ever , second only to his role as Derek Vineyard in American History X and followed closely by his Jack in Fight Club . Marlon Brando is back to remind the world of what a gigantic , gigantic man he has become . He plays the role of Max , the aging crime lord who has become wealthy and powerful enough so that he can preside over break-ins and take a cut of the final profit without doing any of the actual breaking and entering . The film follows the set-up and the execution of the heist , in which the three men plot to steal a French national treasure , and the plot becomes necessarily thicker as the movie goes on . It is a sign of skillful filmmaking when a two-hour film spends the vast majority of its screen time setting up a heist that we don't see until very late into the film , and it still manages to move along briskly and keep the audience's attention . ( spoilers ) The heist itself is particularly well done , with several new difficulties coming up even as the heist is in progress ( they've already had to deal with the sudden addition of motion detectors and cameras in the basement , after it was finally discovered how valuable that thing is that they found in the leg of the termite-infested piano ) , including new revelations about the characters themselves . There is a scene where Jack leaves Nick hanging upside down from the ceiling in the basement , and there is really no apparent reason for him to have done this other than to let us know that Nick seems to have some questionable intentions . The heist itself is obviously the most exciting portion of the film , and the tension escalates more and more with every passing minute . First we are on the edge of our seat because Jack is downstairs , turning cameras on and off for Nick , while we know that his janitor friend Danny is waiting for him upstairs , growing increasingly suspicious . Then Danny comes looking for him , and Jack locks him in a basement room , leaving the rest of the night crew to grow suspicious about both of them . The point of no return was passed a long time ago , and it seems at several points that something is going to go horribly wrong and force them to abort the entire thing , but we know that it's too late for them to be able to do that . The film's finale is truly respectable in that it avoids the traditional high action and manipulative shootouts , and we get a great twist involving Jack and Nick . Nick assumingly goes off into the sunset with his girlfriend , who is played by the under-used Angela Bassett , and everyone lives happily ever after except for Jack , now the subject of a massive manhunt , and Max , who presumably gets nothing from the whole deal . We know that this is a focused action film , even if only from the fact that no one in the film has a last name , but it manages to have an interesting and involved plot with several colorful characters , and an ending that is not exactly original but is made to work very well . Good action , good performances , good direction , and an excellent script make this an action film to remember .
544790	562732	9018	9.0	The Little Tramp as a little tramp .	A Dog's Life has more layers than the usual Chaplin films , taking the character slightly more literally than he usually does . The overall appeal of Chaplin's Little Fellow is that he is such an everyman that he can be thrust into an almost endless multitude of situations , and Chaplin uses his limitless talent to mold it into brilliant , humanitarian farce . In this film , the little tramp is more of a homeless fellow than usual ( I think he's usually just poor and struggling ) , and in the process he be-friends another homeless and struggling tramp . There are some great scenes in the film , although even at only 40 minutes it is a bit too long for the material to support . One scene in particular , where Charlie knocks a bully unconscious , is going to be the most memorable one in the movie , along with a scene where he outsmarts some police officers . There is a charming romance that is neither cloying nor overly involving , just the right amount for a short , light-hearted comedy . This probably would have worked even better as a two reel film , but as it is it stands as one of Chaplin's better three reelers .
544881	562732	887320	9.0	One of the very few looks below the surface . . .	( spoiler ! ) So we learned right at the end of season 6 that Sara and Gil were living together ( or sleeping together ) , as she walked into the room in a bathrobe at the end of the season finale . I've always noticed from the beginning of the series that occasionally there are very brief hints into their personal lives , but nothing ever seems to be really revealed . We've known for a few years that Sara is interested in Grissom romantically , Nick's personal life is almost entirely secret still ( except for a fling or two early in the series ) , Warrick popped up married out of the blue one day and Catherine was clearly disappointed to have lost an opportunity , but it has always seemed like any revelations like this were thrown in using just a few seconds of screen time , and then back to the cases . I like that the show doesn't turn into a soap opera because I would lose interest in a hurry , but this is one of the few episodes that tells us more about what's going on . Very little more , but still more . I loved the cases that they dealt with . A new homicide leads the team to an old and supposedly closed case of a double murder . Catherine goes off on her own to meet the guy they put in prison for it , and finds a foul-mouthed dirtbag that claims he's innocent . In order to get him to cooperate and answer some more questions about the crime that he's already been imprisoned for , she promises to unbutton a button on her shirt for each question that he answers satisfactorily . As it turns out , he was apparently coerced by the police into giving a confession for the double murder , badgering him during questioning and claiming that they already had enough evidence for a conviction , and if he didn't confess he'd get the death penalty . Catherine was pretty angry with the local cop for coercing a confession , but wasn't that blouse-unbuttoning a bit of coersion too ? At least it was more enjoyable than the first time , I suppose . Anyway , the two cases taken together highlight the CSI team's skills compared to the bungling foolishness of other police forces . Once the local cops had coerced their confession , they actually stopped investigating , even though they knew there were more bullets buried at the residence where the murders took place . Nice work ! The local cops also left a massive plot hole in the story , something uncommon in a CSI episode . There was a little boy at the residence who was hiding , but apparently they never asked him any questions about what happened . When our team comes in , Nick and Catherine ask him his version , and he gives one that doesn't reveal anything that they didn't already know , but for some reason they seem to feel that they have gotten some valuable information . The boy was hiding under the sink when the killer knocked on the door , forced his way inside and then stabbed and killed his mother and sister , then he walked outside into the backyard . Then , he says , the killer came back in the front door and called the police . I don't know why anyone was interested in this news , because they already knew the sequence of events leading to the boy's mother and sister's deaths . There is , of course , no way of knowing if the man who came through the front door and called the police was the same man who had just walked out the back door . Why would he leave through the back and come in through the front ? Anyway , the hiding under the sink was funny to me , because when I was five or six , I used to hide under the sink drinking maple syrup while my mom was at work , then when she came home I'd run up to her and say , " I wasn't drinking the syrup ! " I was a terrible liar . Gil leaves on sabbatical at the end of the episode and is supposedly gone when he gets a large box from the miniature killer , which is good because the conclusion to that 3-episode case was a little disappointing . In a huge change of character , he tells Sara on the way out the door that he'll miss her . . .
544721	562732	6177	9.0	Maybe Chaplin's most famous early short comedy .	Of course , Chaplin's early career is over-flowing with famous short comedies , but The Tramp is probably one of the most well-known of the early two-reelers , especially since it is one of the most direct studies of the famous character after whom the film is named . A lot of the Keystone and Essanay films have dated pretty badly , and The Tramp is no exception . Many people may find a lot of the plot confusing or pointless , just random slapstick comedy , although I have a feeling that some of it was not meant to be much more than that . It starts out with the tramp wandering down a dusty road , soon knocked over by the gusts of wind created by two speeding cars , only to pick himself up and dusts his wildly over-sized pants off with the handy little brush that he carries with him , apparently for just such an occasion . There are some clever an amusing sight gags involving things like a pitchfork and huge bags of flour and lot of mallets to the head , but not much in the slapstick department that is entirely memorable . What the film is more famous for is certain elements of the tramp's personality that we learn here , such as his efforts to be proper and presentable despite being broke and wearing pants big enough for two or three of him , along with a jacket that's too small . We also see him protecting a young woman from the bullies of several oafish men , each of whom could easily have brained the little fellow ( as Chaplin later lovingly called him ) , except that he is too smart for them . The film is most memorable for the closing shot , however . Things don't go as planned , we are not given a happily ever after ending , and the movie closes with the tramp again wandering alone down a dusty road , at first seemingly depressed , until after a second or two , he perks up and all but dances down the road . He didn't get what he wanted and he's still poor and lonely , but he faces his life with a smile and seems like he's off to make the best of it . In a lot of ways , that sums up one of the recurring themes that Chaplin espoused throughout his lengthy career . Smile .
544741	562732	367478	9.0	No fluff , just revenge !	All too often in Van Damme movies ( or any action movie , for that matter ) , the action is dumbed down or spread out along a goofy story that is clearly only an excuse for gunfights and car chases . Wake of Death has a moderately clever story and is moderately delivered , but much more emphasis is put on the action . It's gritty and unapologetic with its violence , clearly trying to effectively capture the mob world in which it takes place , and also features what might be Van Damme's best actual acting performance of his entire career . There's an emotional scene in the movie that is so intense it's almost difficult to watch , so I don't want to hear any more from these people who are constantly whining that Van Damme can't act . I'd like to see any of YOU show me anything close to what he did in this movie ! Van Damme stars as Ben Archer , an aging mobster who wants to get out and have a normal life with his family . Of course , his family doesn't know what he really does for a living , as far as they know , he is in the " bar " business . Claiming to be tired of the noise and the smoke and the drinking , he tells his incredulous superior that he wants out , and then heads home . Having seen this set-up a dozen times or more , we know that nothing good can come of this . Ben's wife , Cynthia , is a social worker , and soon finds herself with the problem of a boatload of Chinese refugees , all of whom must be detained and shipped back to China . Strangely , though , they are refugees from Hong Kong . I didn't know there were many refugees coming out of Hong Kong in the early 21st century . In fact , I can't think of a time in modern Chinese history when there were refugees coming from Hong Kong . Clearly , this is unimportant to writers Mick Davis and Laurent Fellous , who seem to be just going on the assumption that , because of Mao Tse-tung's brutal , murderous regime , there have pretty much always been refugees coming from China . The ones in the movie definitely look like mainland Chinese and not people from Hong Kong , except for the little girl , who looks Korean and is even named Kim . I can tell you one thing , out of almost 1 . 4 billion people in mainland China , not one of them is named Kim ! Anyway , Cynthia sees this young girl and decides she's too cute to be shipped back to the horrors of Hong Kong , so she risks her job and reputation to take the girl under her wing . Unfortunately , she is the daughter of Sun Quan , a Chinese mobster of the triad variety ( you remember them from the Infernal Affairs movies ) . Quan , clearly , is not happy about his daughter living with some white people ( " foreign devils , " as they were called back when people really were trying to flee from China ) , so he sets out to find her , killing anyone who gets in his way . At this point , the movie becomes astonishingly violent , even for a Van Damme film . The movie violence is serious here , like in serious gangster movies . The profanity is thick and the movie is not afraid to shoot older women in the face , showing us her exploding head . I had never seen anything like that in any of Van Damme's movies . Quan kills Cynthia , and Ben's grieving her loss is one of the best scenes in the movie , and one of the best examples of Van Damme's acting ability from his entire career . The soundtrack is suitably depressing when it needs to be , such as in the opening credits , which features one of those god-awful moody soap-opera-ish love songs , like the worst of the Bond themes . There is a major slip-up as the little girl doesn't speak a word of English and then , in the same second that Cynthia starts speaking Chinese ( she explains that her grandparents are Chinese , as if language was hereditary ) , Kim busts out with her perfect American English . Nice . I've been teaching English at a University in central China for two years now , and let me tell you , it is almost impossible to teach them to speak English with any accent other than a Chinese one . For that you have to have been raised in America ( or Canada , as it were ) . The movie is not a cognitive workout , of course , but it is definitely a solid action movie that deserves more recognition than it got . Sadly , like the great Bruce Campbell , Van Damme is a little bit of what they call " box office poison , " although I would like to suggest that the reason for this is because of the bad press that he gets from people who jump on the bandwagon , uniformly criticizing his acting and his movies without even really knowing what they're talking about . No , he's not Orson Welles , but he stands for important things and , for all of the shallowness that we've seen in his films , occasionally he takes it upon himself to prove to us that yes , he can act . The problem is that all too often his target audience doesn't require him to , we just want to see his kick the hell out of some bad guys . Wake of Death is the most violent movie he has ever made , and is proof that he is better than most people think he is . I hope one day he really gets the respect that he deserves !
543792	562732	268380	9.0	A great film for children and adults , but they needed more of that squirrel !	Ice Age is a visually stunning animated feature that takes after Shrek in that it is wisely aimed toward adults just as much as children - an important detail the oversight of which just about single-handedly caused the failure of Cats & Dogs . It is structured unfortunately like a birthday cake , in that the candy frosting is at the very beginning and then the actual body of the film , the cake , bears much less of an immediate appeal but is still willingly consumed . The spectacular opening sequence in the film is probably the most recognizable part of the film since it is what makes up the majority of the theatrical trailers . By far the most entertaining part of the film , it introduces a lowly squirrel ( lowly in that it is one of the few animals in the film that doesn't speak ) that makes occasional and very welcome appearances throughout the rest of the film . After this opening sequence ( which easily surpasses the opening sequence of any James Bond film ) , we are quickly introduced to an accident prone sloth named Sid , who is saved from a couple of angry rhinos by a caring mammoth ( Manfred ) who would just as soon save his life and never be seen with him again . They become a grudging partnership when they come across a human baby , as their care of life itself overcomes Manfred's dislike of Sid and his desire to be left alone . I was a little disappointed that this was going to be yet another animated movie with talking animals ( seriously , do we not already have enough of these ? ) the way I was with Dinosaur in 2000 , but for the most part , Ice Age manages to avoid being a routine animated talking animal movie . There is a curious interaction between animals that clearly do not belong together , given their random places on the food chain . Sid sticks with Manfred because Manfred is huge and scary and able to protect Sid from the threat of predators if he can only convince him to let him tag along . Sid does this , even though this is obviously not a symbiotic relationship , and then ultimately they are joined by a sabertooth tiger , of all things , who they trust only because he claims to know a shorter way to get to the humans and return the baby , and also because he alone is not much of a threat to Manfred . ( spoilers ) The place where this film graciously strays from the routine talking animal movie is where the subject of good and evil in the film is concerned . It is no secret that Diego ( the sabertooth , voiced brilliantly by Denis Leary ) is a vicious predator with little on his mind other than obtaining this baby for his pack for revenge purposes and , as an added bonus , tricking Manfred into walking into a trap and feeding his whole pack of tigers with his abundance of meat . This develops a wonderful situation in that we never know what is going to happen and who to trust , and even this involving story is intercut with things like the thrilling ice-slide scene ( which mirrors the sheer thrills created by the door factory scene in Monster , Inc . , arguably the best scene in the film ) , and blanketed by the breathtaking animation first introduced in a mainstream film with Toy Story in 1995 . There is , however , a rather unfortunate quality to the mixing of the characters here , in that it so effectively portrays the carnivores as the bad guys , the evil part of the necessary good and evil ingredients in order to have a story . Also like Cats & Dogs ( which chose to impose the characteristic of evil onto one of the two breeds of rivals seemingly at random ) , this film chooses to present the carnivores as the evil ones , but at least the reasoning is apparent here . The sabertooth tigers are meat-eaters , they kill other animals for food ( and talking animals at that ! ) , so clearly they have to be presented as the antagonists . Never mind the fact that humans are much more vicious and violent predators than sabertooth tigers , right ? Newsflash , vegetarians , if you only want to eat things that were never alive , I hope you can get used to a diet of sand and rocks , because that is just about all that's going to be on the menu . Just kidding , I actually applaud people who make restrictions in their diets because of the things that go on in slaughterhouses . Killing animals for human food is one of the least supervised industries in the world by the animal rights groups , and these practices sicken me to no end ( although have little to no impact on my own gleeful consumption of meat ) , but I hardly think this is an adequate reason to portray sabertooth tigers , who are doing nothing more than following their natural instincts , as evil because of their longing for such a large quantity of meat as Manfred would provide them . The end of Ice Age is the point where the movie comes dangerously close to being overly sentimental and cheesy , given the tearful antics that go on when the baby is returned to the humans . Sid and Manfred give their teary goodbyes just as Diego staggers over the horizon ( assuring us that he is not really dead ) , to do a little peek-a-boo at the baby and then give a little wave . This is cheesy crap , but the rest of the movie is good enough to allow for a little over-sentimentality like this . The best things about Ice Age were things like the rearrangement of the food chain in the partnership that develops throughout the film , the sheer comedy involved in the squirrel's unending efforts to stow away acorns for a winter that is already here , and the new idea of where the English language may have come from ( humans don't speak ! ! ) . Despite the ham-handed message of vegetarianism that permeates the film from beginning to end ( which I dislike more for its blatant ham-handedness than its presence at all ) , Ice Age proudly carries the distinction of being one for the whole family and not just one that the producers want you to BELIEVE is one for the whole family , as was the case with Cats & Dogs . Enjoy it , and don't sit too close to the TV .
544382	562732	93748	9.0	Everyone loves Thanksgiving ?	I watched this movie having heard it mentioned in a fascinating book called Metal Cowboy , which is essentially a sort of journal that this guy named Joe Kurmaskie wrote about his adventures as a touring cyclist . I've gotten very interested in the subject lately , as my increasingly long bicycle adventures have led to an interest in seeing the country from the saddle of a bicycle , and Kurmaskie references Planes , Trains and Automobiles to emphasize a point he makes about the freaky things that can happen to you while traveling , particularly by bus . Steve Martin and John Candy play well off of each other , and it's interesting to note how many weak gimmicks are in the movie and yet how well it pulls it off . You have the traditional odd couple , they run into each other constantly among millions of people , for the sake of the plot , of course , and are such polar opposites that it's impossible not to see the inspiration that the movie took from the classic Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau film , The Odd Couple . But just when you begin to think that the movie is following an easily predicted formula , you get something thrown in that really catches you off guard , like the scene where Neal ( Steve Martin ) finally jumps out of bed , fed up with Del's ( John Candy ) inability to lie still and sleep , and yells at him extensively about every single little thing that he hates about him . It's strange that this can be such a hilarious scene for Martin , similar to Chevy Chase's temper tantrum over his Christmas bonus in National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation , and yet we get cutaways to Del's face that are truly moving . He listens silently to Neal's endless stream of harsh criticisms , and he just watches , his face registering his inability to argue with any of it , and leaving the audience to wonder why we're laughing so hard at this guy who is obviously being hurt . And it's not even that the movie makes you look back at yourself with scenes like this , but that the characters are made so effectively three-dimensional . ( spoilers ) Del is an overly outgoing character who is sociable to a fault . He just wants to make conversation and make friends but ends up annoying instead . Kind of like that line in The Cable Guy , ' I just wanted to be your friend , Steven , but I screwed it up . ' Carrey had won the audience's heart with that one line , but sadly , the remainder of the movie allowed the character to rescind any sympathy . This guy doesn't need a friend , he needs a criminal psychiatrist . Del , on the other hand , badly needs a friend , as we find out later in the movie . As a whole , the movie is about the strenuous things that happen during the holidays . Rather than focus on the difficulties in dealing with the extended family , as was the case in Christmas Vacation , this one focuses on traveling hazards . Three years later writer and Director John Hughes wrote Home Alone , in which John Candy reappears in a similar situation and plays almost exactly the same character . Here , Neal's inability to get on a single plane flight leads to a two-day nightmare involving planes , trains , automobiles and Del Griffith . As is to be expected , this odd couple grows on each other , as they always do , but the movie manages to escape being just another odd couple movie for a variety of reasons . First , there is not resentment and dislike coming from both sides , only an irrational one coming from Neal's side . He has already judged this guy long before he knew him , and it is only Del that is willing to make conversation and simply get along , despite their differences and the difficulty of their situation . I especially loved that the movie did not cop out at the end , which it could very easily have done . It takes two people who could hardly have been more different , puts them together for a matter of days in an extremely stressful situation , and then brings them together at the end without compromising the validity of their characters . It is certainly a bittersweet ending , but one that leaves you with a smile .
544725	562732	5077	9.0	" Ain't love grand ? "	One of Chaplin's longest films up to that point , Burlesque on Carmen is a clever and surprisingly complex parody of what was then " Prosper Merimee's " well-known story about " Carmen . " I was a little confused about the difference between the IMDb's listing of the 1915 Burlesque on Carmen and the 1916 version . Based on the running time I assume that it was the 1915 version that I saw , since the 1916 one is a good 20 minutes longer , and from what I've read , those are 20 unnecessary and unimpressive minutes . From the very beginning , it's clear that Burlesque on Carmen is one of Chaplin's most complex and ambitious efforts to date , starting off with a long back story , told through inter-titles , about the tragic love story of Carmen . Carmen is sent by a band of gypsies ( " A band who put the GYP in gypsy . " ) , to seduce a Spanish officer so they can pull off their smuggling operation . It's a clever , Chaplinesque band of criminals , the leader of whom , Lillas Pastia , has " spent 50 years learning to steal , thinking he might be offered a job in politics . " On a side note , I've seen some almost misogynistic messages and jokes in some of Chaplin's earlier work , but probably none quite as overt as in this one . Near the beginning of the movie , as the band of gypsies are traveling , there is a scene where the mules and women are loading , and an inter-title explains that " the mules are the ones with long ears . " In case you couldn't tell , I guess . Chaplin plays the part of Don Jose , the hapless officer who is to be seduced by Carmen . He is described as " a brave soldier and lover of women . " Not exactly a stretch for Chaplin who removed any doubt about his ability to play a convincing comic soldier a few years later in the brilliant Shoulder Arms . And of course , he didn't have to act about being a lover of women . What is different here , of course , is his polished military uniform and straight-backed disciplinary manner , interspersed , of course , with some of his traditional slap-stick moves . He strikes me as a little guy in a position of authority , struggling to maintain the respect of his subordinates by exerting a gruff , stolid exterior . Soon Carmen enters ( " Loved by all men under the age of 96 ? " ) , and she immediately begins flirting with Charlie . I should mention that for a good majority of the movie , it is surprisingly faithful to the original story , which was full of jealousy and tragedy . Chaplin is strangely convincing as a jealous lover , able to evoke a jealous passion that I've never seen from him . There's at least one scene where he is genuinely a little scary . Chaplin has some great sight gags in the movie , like a hilarious table dance and some classic sword fighting near the end . And his boyish charm and the role of a soldier is also definitely a winning combination , although there is another peculiar stunt involving a group of men pushing a huge door back and forth that wasn't very effective to begin with but just kept going on and on and on , probably about five times longer than it was worth . Although it was interesting that when it finally fell over it clearly was revealed as a movie prop . I always appreciate such glimpses at the old movie sets . The end of the film is it's strongest part . It bears striking resemblance to Romeo and Juliet , but just when you think that Chaplin is going to conduct a major thematic experiment by diverging distantly from his traditional style , there is a hilarious twist that is as vintage Chaplin as anything I've ever seen . Nice work !
544324	562732	120188	9.0	An excellent post-war film , Three Kings has great performances from everyone involved , a great story , unique photography , and a solid message about humanity .	It's almost impossible to go wrong with George Clooney , and he proves himself yet again with his spectacular performance in Three Kings . Clooney , Mark Wahlberg , and Ice Cube are three soldiers in the Middle East just after the end of the 1991 Gulf War . Clooney leads them as they make an attempt to steal a huge amount of Kuwaiti gold bullion that has been taken away from Kuwait by Saddam Hussein . The job that the United States was trying to do was to confiscate everything that Hussein had taken and give it back to Kuwait , and Clooney saw a get rich quick opportunity and decided to go for it . However , Three Kings is not just a film about a bunch of greedy military personnel . During the course of their efforts to obtain the gold , the three guys , with an increasing number of sidekicks , come across several disturbing events , and they eventually set aside their financial goals for the immediate chance to help a lot of people who are being brutalized by Saddam's army . This is a very humane thing to do , and it is very uplifting to watch , but it also has numerous potentially damaging side effects . For example , eight years after the war has ended , it once again makes many of the people in the Middle East look barbaric . Besides that , it seems to be saying something about the role that the United States plays in the global society . In Three Kings , it almost seems that the rest of the world is in turmoil , and it is up to the U . S . to get out there are straighten everyone else out . However , regardless of this , Three Kings is still a very entertaining and thought provoking film that nonetheless gets a good message across . But I still think that it's way past time for Ice Cube to start using his real name , and the same goes for other rap-stars-turned-actors , such as Ice T and countless others . Do you think Mark Wahlberg would command any respect whatsoever if he still called himself Marky Mark ? Both of these guys , by the way , delivered some of the best acting of their careers in Three Kings , and this combined with the good story and unique photography made for a very good war film .
543941	562732	397101	9.0	Hoodoo voodoo we do ! !	VGS fans will get that , but for everyone else I recommend just checking out this movie . I rented The Skeleton Key mostly because for the last few months I have been trying to watch every movie that comes out . Netflix has provided me with the opportunity of just adding all the new movies to my queue and not having to try and remember all of the movies that I've missed , which I always did before , given the constant barrage of new releases . I know I'll never catch up ( my Netflix queue is approaching the 300 mark ) , but it's at times like this that I'm glad that I try to watch all of the movies that come out ( Hellraiser 8 left me with a different sentiment entirely ) . One of the first things that struck me about The Skeleton Key was that it is a great horror movie to take a date to see . It focuses on creating a solid story and building tension rather than blood and gore , which with rare exceptions is how the best horror films are made anyway . Kate Hudson plays Caroline , an aspiring nurse who quits her job at a hospital because of their intolerable lack of concern over deaths , she doesn't feel right about working at a hospital that sees their patients as so much of a business and has little humane interest in them . When a patient passes away and is whisked away with the trash she decides she's had enough and starts combing the classifieds for something a little more personal . She finds a job as a live-in caregiver for a woman and her husband , who has suffered a massive stroke that affected both sides of his body , and it's not long before we learn that Caroline herself lost her father , so suddenly , in fact , that she was unable to help care for him at the end of his life , hence her overwhelming determination to provide the best care possible . Caroline is given a skeleton key that will open every door in the house , but when she finds one door hidden in the attic that the key doesn't open , obviously it takes on the most intrigue of all of the rooms in the house . There is a lot of stuff about voodoo and cults in the movie , and while it is really the backbone of the film it is not what makes it good . The movie is good because it has history behind it . It takes its time in getting started , but that's important because it takes the time necessary to tell the story behind what goes on in the movie . And probably most importantly , in my opinion , is that the movie was filmed on an old plantation house in Louisiana that actually housed well over a hundred slaves , which not only adds intrigue but relevance as well . There's a point about three quarters of the way through the movie that it seems that it's going to pan out in a pretty predictable way , but there's a great twist near the end that , while it is certainly a turn away from what may have been expected , it also has the enviable quality of giving the impression that the movie had to go that way all along , which is one of the first lessons I learned about storytelling back in college , that a good story cannot be predictable , yet the ending has to seem perfectly natural , that it could only have ended the way it did . And while this movie could certainly have ended in other ways , it wouldn't have been as good as it is if it had ended any other way . Also make sure to check out the surprising number of extra features on the DVD , particularly John Hurt's story and the story of the house in which the movie was filmed .
544609	562732	110005	9.0	" Only the best people fight against all obstacles in the pursuit of happiness . "	Besides being , to me , a fascinating although eccentric look at an example of every day life in 1950s New Zealand ( one of only two or three places in the world that I have wanted to visit all my life ) , Heavenly Creatures is also the first movie that really shows that talent of Peter Jackson , which may have been overshadowed in his previous career by the sheer quantity of blood and guts that he packed into his earliest films . I have read that a lot of people were initially put off by the premise of an intense loving relationship between two teenage girls , but it should be noted that their relationship , if sexual at all , is sexual in a purely symbolic way . If nothing else , Jackson has made a stupendous achievement of making a film about this relationship and completely preventing any sense of eroticism from creeping up . The movie tells the shocking true story of two teenage girls who crushed the skull of one of their mothers with a rock , and what led them to commit such a heinous crime . My understanding is that the story is told with a great deal of creative liberties , but the focus is on a kind of friendship that few people ever find . Two girls with strengths and weaknesses that perfectly complement each other , who run through the world at full speed giggling with glee as if unable to understand the pure happiness that they feel when they are together . Soon , various events come in the way of their friendship . Melanie Lynskey plays Pauline , and Kate Winslet , in her first film role , plays Juliet , who is noticeably horrified when her parents bring up the prospect of leaving the country for a mere three weeks . While separated , they write each other elaborate letters , describing events that take place in an imaginary world that they have created together . When the separations become longer ( and more obviously because of parents ' misguided ( ? ) concerns about a homosexual relationship ) , their efforts to remain together become more and more desperate . As they say , never underestimate the power of stupid people in large numbers , or even the power and danger of a couple of teenage girls bent on maintaining their friendship . People are dangerous in groups , even groups of two ( I realize , just this second , that tomorrow morning I have three classes of university students preparing to give final exam presentations in groups of two and three . I hope I haven't made a horrible mistake ! ! ) . Complicating matters for Pauline and Juliet are four wildly unhelpful parents . Juliet's mother is distracted by her disintegrating marriage and futile affairs while her professional father is benevolent and professional but both hapless and helpless , while Pauline's mother is over - controlling and militant about her discipline , and her father seems to just want the whole thing to go away . The parents and the children are pulling in opposite directions , and they pull harder and harder and harder until finally the rope snaps , as it must . There are a number of truly impressive and memorable sections of the film , such as the presentation of the imaginary world that Pauline and Juliet have created together , particularly the clay characters that populate it . These things make it a movie that is difficult to categorize but easy to remember , and they show a sense of visual style that Jackson later went on to develop even further in the Lord of the Rings films and King Kong . Some say that he will never be able to top the Lord of the Rings movies , but personally I think he still has a few things up his sleeve . We can hope , anyway . Note ? it's well known that the real life Juliet has been revealed to be the successful murder mystery novelist Anne Perry , which is a perfect ending to her story ( although I would have expected Pauline to become the writer ) . Also , Melanie Lynksey has had a surprisingly successful acting career , appearing in many successful films , including a periodic role as the slightly crazy but immensely attractive Rose on 2 ½ Men .
544607	562732	181689	9.0	In the world of the blind , the one-eyed man is king ?	This is spoken in Minority Report by a drug-dealer on the streets with no eyes at all , so I suppose its free advice for John Anderton , our hero , or a bit of wise-sounding advice meant to get across to the audience but with no other good place for it to fit in the film . This is fine with me , too , because Minority Report is such a taut futuristic thriller that an incongruous little bit of wisdom like this is not to have any negative impact on the film as a whole . John Anderton , played with precision by the great Tom Cruise ( oh shut up , the man's awesome ) , is the chief of the Pre-Crime department in the District of Columbia , which has successfully eradicated murder entirely for the last six years . He works with a group of ' pre-cogs ' that , together , dream of murders that have not yet taken place and project enough information for Anderton and his team to watch the video emanating from their heads to determine where and when the murders are to take place and to get to those locations and stop the murders from happening before they happen . This is obviously a formula for a highly successful action movie , but the thing that really makes Minority Report succeed is that it pays so much amount of attention to things that would occur in this situation in real life . It is explained very early in the film that the invention of Pre-Crime has eradicated premeditated murder , as this is most easily detected by the pre-cogs . The majority of the ' business , ' then , of the Pre-Crime division in the District of Columbia , are crimes of passion . This not only provides the possibility of a lot more tension in that these crimes leave a lot less time for prevention , but also avoids complicating the plot with the details of premeditated murders . We don't care about a guy who wronged another guy five years ago or drug deals gone bad , all we need to hear about are a guy who comes home to find his wife in bed with another man and loses control . Given the fact that the movie involves some sort of time-travel ( even if information is the only thing traveling through time ) , it leaves itself open to criticism about plot holes . This is obvious , because plot holes like this even permeated the unparalleled Back to the Future series , which obviously had plenty of plot holes but handled them spectacularly well . Given the amount of movies that I have seen that involve time travel , I have come up with this equation : Time Travel = Plot Holes . This is a universal equation that is never escaped , but it does not mean that any movie that involves time travel will be brought down by the subsequent and unavoidable plot holes . Minority Report did not suffer from its necessary plot holes and neither did the timeless Back to the Future series ( which has FINALLY been released as a complete set and which no respectable movie collection could possibly be without ) . My esteemed colleague and close friend Christopher Brown ( see his brilliant reviews at http us imdb com CommentsAuthor 625436 ) points out one of these plot holes in his review of Minority Report , but makes the mistake of suggesting that , given the nature of the precognition and of the crime itself , Anderton's murder should never have been predicted since it did not entail premeditation . Sorry , Chris , but you've missed the boat on this one . The only thing that this does is bring up the fact that it's impossible to tell where precognition starts . It could be argued perfectly well that the pre-cogs played a part in their own precognition . They predicted that Anderton would commit the murder under the circumstances that he would have been watching the thoughts of the pre-cogs and seen that he would commit murder , and then obviously sought to find out for himself how he could have been expected to commit a murder against a person he has never heard of . In this case , if he had called in sick that day , all of this would have been avoided . But he's the best at what he does , he has personal reasons for wanting to stop murder , he does not slack off , he does not call in sick . John Anderton was predicted by the pre-cogs to commit murder because he was at work that day . The action in the film comes from the possibility that the whole prediction of Anderton's murder might be what is called a ' minority report , ' where the pre-cogs disagree on something that is going to happen . If he can prove that only one of the pre-cogs came up with the vision that he was going to commit a murder , it might cancel out the entire prediction because it is unreliable . On the way to this goal , we are presented with everything from a tremendously dedicated investigator ( played brilliantly by Colin Farrell ) to some amazingly creepy but strangely accepted identification spiders that scan John's implanted eye in one of the more uncomfortable scenes in the film . Minority Report is one of the best and most unique thrillers to be released in years . It is the conglomeration of such a dizzying array of films that it is difficult to contemplate them all at once . We see elements of action films , futuristic thrillers , crime films , science fiction , and of course , the influence of Stanley Kubrick is never far off . There is even , especially in the later portion of the film , a heavy influence on the soundtrack by Bernard Herrman , who was the composer for most of Alfred Hitchcock's films , among many others . It's always nice to see such a respectful homage like that , and it is only one of the many things that makes Minority Report yet another addition to Steven Spielberg's extensive list of high-end films ( the last of which was the spectacular A . I . ) . The only thing I can think of that holds Minority Report back from joining Spielberg's list of timeless classics is that it does not have the scope as far as its target audience as such films as E . T . and Jurassic Park . However , despite not having quite as large of a target audience , Minority Report stands as a strong entry in Spielberg's growing list of great films .
543839	562732	174856	9.0	This is the best boxing film that's not really a boxing film since Rocky .	There is no role that Denzel Washington fits more perfectly in than the kind he played in racially charged atmosphere in The Hurricane . When he and that poor kid John Artis were pulled over and the officer said that they were looking for two negroes in a white car , no actor could have been better than Denzel when he said , " Any two will do ? " What a perfect piece of casting , and Denzel Washington was startlingly convincing as the legendary Rubin Carter throughout the entire film . Every actor performed amazingly , even Liev Schrieber , who makes a smart turn after all of his obnoxious performances in the Scream trilogy . However , I have to say that I did get a little bit tired of watching Vicellous Reon Shannon mumble through his lines as the determined Lesra Martin , but besides his slightly botched dialogue he also contributed an important element of innocence and wonder to the film . The Hurricane is a nearly flawlessly photographed film . Every scene has such perfect cinematography that you forget that you're watching a movie , you're actually THERE . This was especially important in the many prison scenes , particularly when Carter was in " the hole " for refusing to wear prison clothes , where his fall into temporary insanity was creatively and amazingly portrayed . I've seen people go insane in a huge number of movies ( Hilary and Jackie ( 1998 ) , Shine ( 1996 ) , Little Voice ( 1999 ) , and even Little Man Tate ( 1991 ) ) , but I've never seen the editing used to make a character seem that he was actually having a conversation with himself . Excellent piece of filmmaking right there . The time periods were portrayed perfectly , the costumes were designed to fit not only the time period but also each specific actor , and the dialogue was absolutely engrossing in every scene . This was an absolutely incredible film . It moves the audience just as much as even the most emotionally intense films , and it is a great film to enjoy and learn from at the same time . Unfortunately , there were a few fairly important things that were left out that just should not have been . ( spoilers ) For example , we never find out what happened to Carter's wife . Sure , it's easy to assume that she divorced him , but after the scene when she visits him and he tells her that he's going to die in prison , we never see or hear from her or about her again . Also , nothing really came of the strong threats that Terry ( John Hannah ) , Lisa ( Deborah Unger ) , Sam ( Liev Schrieber ) , and Lesra ( Vicellous Shannon ) received from Detective Vincent Pesca ( Dan Hedaya ) on the street corner that day except for one time when their brakes were evidently disabled . Sure , that's a pretty vicious thing to do , but when he approached the four of them he seemed pretty determined to stop their investigation at all costs . The last thing that I think should be noted ( as well as the most important ) , is that at the end of the film , nothing ever came of the heinous crimes that were committed against Rubin Carter . None of the people who falsely imprisoned him ( especially Det . Pesca , who had falsely imprisoned Carter for most of his life ) were ever reprimanded for their negligence to uphold the law . At the same time , however , this can be seen as a very respectable element of the film , because it suggests that the movie is about the tremendous strength of the human spirit in the face of hopeless circumstances , and that it is NOT about revenge . This is the kind of thing that you get from films that are somehow able to avoid the poisonous influences of Hollywood , and they are often not easily accepted because people don't look at the actual meaning of things like this , they just want a perfectly happy ending . The Hurricane is an example of a film in which you have to look at what the ending MEANS , not just the basic way that it happened . This same is true for other great films like Boys Don't Cry ( 1999 ) and Life Is Beautiful ( 1997 ) . The emphasis is not on happy endings , but instead on being as accurate as possible in the depiction of reality , which does not work at all like a movie does . This type of thing is especially important in true stories , such as The Hurricane . The Hurricane is among the most powerful films released in years . I think that it is just as emotionally intense as films like Schindler's List and American History X and , like both of the above mentioned films , it not only provides wonderful entertainment , but it also tackles one of the most important messages that can possibly be delivered to our society today - the destructive power of racism . From the opening scenes of the movie , you just love Rubin Carter , and the way that his life is demolished because of racism and prejudice is an extremely powerful thing to watch . Every scene is saturated with emotion and intelligence and cinematic skill , and the end result is magical .
544488	562732	389557	9.0	Smart war thriller from an international action veteran ?	OK , so anytime I hear the name Paul Verhoeven I always immediately think of Robocop , which I saw for the first time when I was about ten years old and I never quite recovered from that scene where Murphy gets all shot up by the bad guys . It was a movie moment at a formative point in my life where I really learned the extent to which people can go in doing terrible things to each other ( years later , I saw things like Texas Chainsaw and Wes Craven's Last House on the Left and The Hills Have Eyes and realized that I hadn't seen anything yet ) . Verhoeven began his American film-making career with Robocop , an enormously violent and hugely popular success , and began a career spanning nearly two decades of working on a lot of big budget Hollywood movies like Basic Instinct , Total Recall and the disappointing Hollow Man . I wouldn't expect a respectable World War II film to come from someone with such a filmography , but Black Book is sort of a return back to Verhoeven's days as a filmmaker in the Netherlands , where he had a successful career before coming to Hollywood . It's becoming more and more difficult for people to come up with unique and interesting stories involving the widespread struggles against the Nazis in WWII . I would even suggest that it's becoming safe to say that a WWII film can be made or broken solely by the performances , which are becoming more and more the most memorable things about these movies because so much of the stories are already known . In Black Book , however , Verhoeven's European film-making sensibilities mix nicely with his Hollywood experience to bring together a fascinating and even fresh , albeit fictional , story of a small group of people fighting back against the Nazis as the war slowly begins to go wrong for them . The title of the movie refers to a book that lists the names of wealthy Jews who pay handsome fees to be transported to safety , only the be killed and robbed be the Nazis . The movie takes place in Holland in 1944 . Carice von Houten plays Rachel Stein , a young Jewish singer living in hiding . She and her family come into contact with a man who claims to know a way to transport them all safely out of Nazi territory and into a neutral zone . During their night escape , however , they are gunned down and Rachel is the only survivor . She eventually joins a group of Dutch resistance fighters where she works menial jobs for a while before finally being promoted to a job of much higher importance and danger . Her task ? infiltrate the Nazi hierarchy and seduce a high-ranking officer , Ludwig Muntz and bug Nazi headquarters so the resistance can listen in on the Nazis war planning . Muntze is attracted to her and the seduction is easy , but Rachel fails to hide the fact that she's Jewish and , even worse , she ultimately falls in love with him . This all starts to sound a little cheesy , but it's actually one of the movie's strong points . I've read that the movie has been shrouded in some controversy , particularly in America , for having the audacity to portray a high - ranking Nazi official as anything other than pure evil , although I tend to doubt very much that any lack of deserved recognition that the movie found is probably a result of being filmed all in original languages . This was an artistic decision , not an economic one , and it was a smart one . Had they made the movie in English , a huge element of authenticity would have been lost . Indeed , portraying a Nazi official in a respectable light is a lofty goal but the movie pulls it off amazingly well . And the authenticity of the movie is astonishing . It has all the polish of a Jerry Bruckheimer production but none of the stupid plot devices or cheap romantic subplots generated to drive the weak story . This is a stunning story of betrayal and total sacrifice in the face of insurmountable odds and adversity , and a brilliant cast arranges themselves behind Carice von Houten , who delivers a spectacular performance as a woman forced to bury intense emotions even while she strips herself of her dignity for the benefit of her oafish enemies . The plot is too thick to explain in its entirety in a review , and it would also subtract from the fun of watching it all develop yourself . But there is real betrayal on the Nazi side and suspected betrayal on the side of the resistance that leaves Rachel and Muntze on the run from their lives , both of them fleeing from the very people that have been providing them with their safety . There is also a powerful statement on the endlessness of war as the movie shows us that the killing doesn't always stop when the radio announces a victory for either side . It reminds us that after countless thousands of years or wars , human beings are no closer to world peace now than we've ever been . Paul Verhoeven has done something noticeably different with Black Book than we have become used to seeing from him over the last few years , but he has definitely turned around a worrisome direction that his movies started taking with Showgirls and bottomed out with Hollow Man . It's nice to see that Verhoeven has gotten his magic back !
544069	562732	189998	9.0	Not for all tastes , but for anyone who is into classic horror films , or filmmaking in general , this is a must see .	( spoilers ) John Malkovich delivers an excellent performance as F . W . Murnau , the director of the classic vampire film Nosferatu . The most impressive thing about this film , in my opinion , is the way that that vampire was brought back to life . Willem Dafoe played , with nearly flawless accuracy , Max Schreck , the actor who played the part of the vampire in 1922 when Nosferatu was filmed . This is an amazing performance because it is so complex , although at times Dafoe overacted a bit . I'm always impressed when people play roles in which they portray someone else who is also playing a role . Jim Carrey , for example , did this in Man on the Moon , as well as on an episode of the Conan O'Brien show , in which he played O'Brien playing Carrey . In that show , Carrey played a comedian impersonating a comedian impersonating a comedian ( himself ) . In Shadow of the Vampire , Dafoe does this as well ; he plays the part of a vampire impersonating a person impersonating a vampire . Shadow of the Vampire is about the making of Nosferatu , except that there is the small addition that Max Schreck is a vampire in real life , and the reason that he would only ever appear on the set in full make-up is because that's what he really looked like , he really was Nosferatu . It's not hard to see how this story was realized , because not only is it true that Schreck would only appear in full make-up , but this was also the only film that he ever appeared in . I think that this is one of the things that makes this such an interesting film , because it is filmed and presented in a way that relates directly to real life , making the supernatural element of it much more effective . Malkovich and Dafoe have excellent chemistry on screen as the director and the star of Nosferatu , and this relationship is made even more interesting when it becomes clear that Schreck really is Nosferatu , that it's not just an act , and that Murnau knows about it . The way that Murnau tries to keep this a secret , even at the cost of the lives of members of his crew , suggests a tremendous dedication to the making of the film , which is now hailed as a milestone in cinematic history . People who are not interested in the history of film or filmmaking or horror classics are likely to be bored and ultimately disappointed by Shadow of the Vampire . But if it is viewed with an open mind , this is a really good movie . It not only presents an interesting story - that of the making of a vampire film in which the vampire is portrayed by a real vampire ? but it also has strong ties to reality , a quality that is extremely rare among horror films . With the right state of mind , I think that almost anyone could enjoy this film .
544769	562732	405159	10.0	One of the most moving films I've ever seen .	I am writing this review on the afternoon of February 27th , a couple hours before the Academy Awards begin , and I really think that the Best Picture category is going to be mostly a contest between The Aviator and Million Dollar Baby , both of which are spectacular films , as are the rest of the nominees ( Finding Neverland , Ray , and Sideways , in my order of preference ) . I caught this movie about a week ago at a theater a block from my house . The one thing that I really like about living in LA is that , especially at Oscar time , just about any movie nominated in any category is bound to still be playing somewhere , regardless of how long ago it was released . Except Best Animated Short Film , of course . I still think those never play anywhere . I have a feeling that Mystic River was passed over for the Best Picture award because of too much similarity to Clint Eastwood's outstanding 1999 film True Crime , and I had anticipated something in that general vein with Million Dollar Baby , if only because the appearance of the film is so similar . Eastwood has gone from making westerns to making one exceedingly dark film after another , and in this film he has succeeded like he never has in his storied career . Eastwood plays Frankie Dunn , the owner of a pretty run-down boxing gym where hopefuls come to work out and get some training from him . It's the kind of gym from which you don't really expect to see many people rise to boxing stardom , so Frankie concentrates hard on one man that he's training , who has a chance at a title bout . It is during this time that Maggie ( Hillary Swank ) walks into the gym and starts calling him Boss , which he does not appreciate because , as he flatly tells her , " I don't train girls . " Up to this point in the film the plot has not really revealed itself . We know we are watching a movie about boxing that's not really about boxing ( a sports movie cliché that Million Dollar Baby brilliantly sidesteps ) and that Maggie is more than likely going to turn into the brilliant boxer that Frankie has been looking for . But beyond that the movie could go in a hundred different directions , and it promptly goes exactly where you didn't think it was going to go . This could very easily have become a quickly forgettable sports film that disappeared into video store obscurity like even the good sports films like Miracle and Mystery , Alaska seem to have done , but by the end of the movie it has gone in such an original direction and given the audience such an emotional workout that , on my way out of the theater I saw people leaning against the handrail . This movie is so powerful that you have to rest after you see it . Frankly , given how violent some of these sports movies are , especially ones like this , it amazes me that no other ones have gone as far as Million Dollar Baby does . The boxing scenes are thrilling to watch , even providing good comic relief as Maggie consistently knocks girls out in the first round and then looks sheepishly over at Frankie in her corner , who has instructed her not to knock them out so fast because it's getting so no one wants to put their boxer in the ring with her . He ends up having to bribe managers . The conflict comes from the fact that Maggie is desperate for a title fight . She has come from a trailer in middle America where she worked as a waitress for something like 17 years , and she knew that she would never do anything else until she got herself out of there on her own . Her family certainly was not going to help . My God man , I could not believe those people . She was uneducated and unskilled , she didn't even know how to box but she had the determination and the motivation to learn , and learn she certainly did . The problem is that one of Frankie's past trainees who managed to get a title fight was Eddie " Scrap-Iron " Dupris ( played in the movie by Morgan Freeman ) , who not only lost the fight but also was knocked blind in one eye . By the end of the movie , by the way , I like to think that Eddie may have considered changing his nickname to Eddie " 110 " Dupris . Frankie blames himself and he doesn't want to have another fighter injured . An honorable feeling , but it clashes with Maggie's goals , for whom not getting a chance to a title fight means she'll have to go back to being a waitress , which to her is nothing more than waiting to die . The interaction between the three characters is some of the best I've seen in years . And I've seen a lot of movies in years . I am reminded of Friday Night Lights , which came out in late 2004 and was hailed as the best sports movie ever made , a bold statement that inspired me to eventually watch it . Fairly entertaining movie , but the ludicrous statement that it's the greatest sports movie ever made becomes even more ludicrous if you consider Million Dollar Baby to be a sports movie . This is one of the great films in all of film history . Do NOT miss it . And with that , it's almost 4 o'clock . I'm going to go up to Hollywood Blvd . and see if I can catch a glimpse of Clint Eastwood .
544483	562732	41959	10.0	Carol Reed molds a great mystery that unfolds more and more throughout the course of the film . Wonderfully photographed , acted , written , and directed .	Orson Welles is excellent as Harry Lime , a man who invites his friend Holly Martins to visit him in Vienna from his home in the United States . When Holly arrives , he learns that Harry has been killed in a car accident . When he tries to find out more about the accident that killed his friend , Holly encounters surprisingly strong opposition . The Third Man is put together amazingly well and contains some truly amazing cinematography , including several scenes on the war-torn streets of Vienna . Maybe the most unusual quality of this film is the fact that it is pulled along mostly by the quality of the story , rather than star actors or special effects ( which were , of course , much less common in 1949 than they are today ) . The story is so complex and well-told that it almost overshadows even such stars ( in true " star roles " ) as Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten . The Third Man is a classic post-war film . It is amazingly well done , and should not be missed .
544451	562732	118715	10.0	What in God's holy name are you blathering about ? !	There's really only one good part of The Big Lebowski , but it's a REALLY good part . It's one of those scenes that you see in a movie and you tell your friends about it for years , you constantly spout off hilarious quotes from that scene that you remember laughing so hard about , you develop inside jokes about the scene with the friends who were lucky enough to be there to watch it with you , and you may even begin to regularly consume certain types of alcoholic beverages that you saw enjoyed by the main characters in that scene . The earth-quakingly memorable scene ( indeed , as I said before , the only good scene in the entire film ) is the one that begins immediately after the opening credits and ends approximately 117 minute later just before the screen fades and the end credits roll . Not laughing ? To hell with you , that's funny ! And the movie's even funnier ! Every character in The Big Lebowski is developed perfectly to serve the purpose of the story . These characters truly have personality , especially The Dude ( ' Who the fk IS this guy ? ! ' ) , Walter ( ' Donny , you're out of your league ! ' ) , and even Mr . Lebowski's geeky assistant , Brandt . They may occasionally be stereotypical characters , but they fit perfectly with the story , augmenting it even though it's already complex and interesting . This movie has an excellent plot line that is punctuated with endlessly hilarious dialogue ( ' Donny , you're outta your element ! ' ) , and peppered with well-developed and interesting characters . Jeff Bridges delivers a spectacular performance as the Dude , flawlessly capturing the slacker attitude and lazy lifestyle that that character lives . His love for White Russians has made that drink a staple at my house , and is now among my favorite alcoholic drinks . Yeah , big accomplishment , but that's the kind of thing that makes a movie like this even better . As a college student , I can see the difference between the slacker life that I lived in high school , and the extremely busy one that I live now . The Dude has chosen to perpetuate that lifestyle , living his life on the couch and at the bowling alley , constantly dirt-poor but obviously perfectly content with himself . The only time he is even the slightest bit upset is when something disrupts that lifestyle and his rug gets ruined . Clearly , a nice rug is not something that a person in The Dude's line of work ( i . e . unemployment ) can easily replace . He is even almost completely calm when the guys break into his apartment at the beginning of the movie , and doesn't really seem to be too upset until one of them ps on his rug . The interactions between The Dude , Walter ( John Goodman ) , Donny ( Steve Buscemi ) , and , eventually , the Jesus combine to make some of the most amusing moments of the film , but it is enormously entertaining from beginning to end . There cannot possibly be enough praise given to this movie to do it justice . Watch this movie , you are sure to love it . And if you don't , watch it again , because you must have missed something . A true contemporary classic of modern comedy .
544577	562732	91455	10.0	Definitely one of Pixar's greatest short animated films .	Because I am so loathe to put one over the other , I just want to say that Geri's Game , For The Birds , and Luxo Jr . are the three greatest short animated films that have come from Pixar so far . What you have here is an extremely well made film that creates live characters without the use of dialogue or facial expressions or even bodies , and all this tremendously realistic animation was done in the 80s , before computers themselves had had much of an impact on the movies , especially as compared to today ! Luxo Jr . is an absolutely ingenius creation of animation , Pixar managed to come straight out and begin their career with a flawless animation film . There is , however , also the notable exception of any humans in the film , which should be mentioned here because that is the thing that Pixar's films have had the greatest difficulty with . The baby in Tin Toy was absolutely monstrous and hideous , and even in the full length Toy Story , the human faces were never made to look quite right . The emphasis , however , was placed on the toys in the film , which was one of the many reasons that it was such a great film . In Luxo Jr . , Pixar seems to be making a simple statement about what they can do with computer animation , and they have been tremendously successful . This film is absolutely flawless as far as characterization , simplicity , amusement , and , probably most of all , the amazingly realistic sound effects that served to help bring the hopping lamps to life . This is some of the simplest stuff that can be brought to the screen and still have meaning ( simple , that is , as far as content , not creation ) , but Pixar has managed to make this three minute film a truly memorable cinematic experience .
543817	562732	43456	10.0	Join us and live in peace or pursue your present course and face obliteration ?	It's odd to think that fifty years from now there may only be a handful of movies released in 2004 that will be remembered at all . I don't care to venture any guesses as to what they may be , but it's easy to see why The Day the Earth Stood Still is one of the ones from 1951 that remains a classic , while so many others sank into obscurity . The movie deals with a theme that was at the forefront of so many peoples ' minds in the early 1950s , in America and the rest of the world , and that is the conflicts between many different nations , and more generally the tendency for humans to fight each other . It was released at the time of the Red Scare and so soon after World War II that international tensions were still high . Also odd is that if you switch the last two words in the title , why , it's not very frightening at all ! Okay , that made no sense , but I couldn't resist . My respect for the movie dimmed sharply when I saw that the alien was not only a man , but a good looking man who spoke perfect English , but then won back my respect completely when it took the time to explain that his culture had learned about humans through intercepting radio transmissions over many years . Unlikely , but it's an explanation , which is more than most science fiction films provide . Granted , not much time should be wasted on the science of science fiction , but in this case something had to be said . The alien didn't give may details as to his physical condition , but scientists hypothesized that since he so closely resembles a human , he must have a similar environment to our own on his planet . Speaking of which , there is one thing about the science that I'm also curious about . At what stage were astronomical studies in the early 1950s ? I'm wondering how far into space scientists were looking , because Carpenter , the alien , states with some grandeur that he has traveled 250 million miles to get to earth , which in astronomical terms is a tiny , tiny distance . Considering that the sun is 93 million miles from earth , this would mean that his planet is within our own solar system . And here's another little factoid ? Earth makes a complete revolution around the sun every year , as you know . Pluto , on the other hand , takes something like 248 years to revolve around the sun . That has nothing to do with the movie , but is an interesting digression , I should think . I found the political backdrop to be one of the most interesting things about the movie , and not only because of what the political landscape was like at the time . It was interesting to watch a movie about aliens that so quickly and completely dissolved into a close examination of volatile human relations , and without ever becoming preachy or devolving into peace propaganda ( oxymoron intended ) . I actually think that a large part of what made up for the lack of aliens in this alien movie was the validity that its argument has . When Carpenter ( who they stopped just short of simply naming Jesus ) was greeted with the response that a meeting with all of the worlds leaders was impossible because of tensions between nations , he was genuinely surprised and saddened . He gives as his reason for visiting earth the fact that his civilization has noticed satellites being launched around the Earth's atmosphere and , since humans clearly are unable to get along , he was sent here to tell us to join them and live in peace or face our present course and face obliteration . Most importantly , if we chose the latter , they would be there to ensure that we would not export our violence to peaceful civilizations in space . The descending nature with which he speaks is truly revealing , it makes humans look childish because of our constant battling with one another . This is also where the movie coincides with some of the themes that Jonathan Swift presented in Utopia , his novel upon which several failed civilizations have been attempted . They have created robots , which we seen in the Iron Man , to prevent the rise of violence in their society . The robots have tremendous power , which cannot be revoked , and at the first sign of violence they react swiftly against the aggressor , which results in a peaceful society . I'm also reminded of Gulliver's Travels , also by Jonathan Swift , particularly the section where Gulliver lives among the Houynymns which , interestingly enough , are talking horses with a remarkable ability to live at peace . When at one point Gulliver describes lying , which does not exist to the Houynymns , one of them responds incredulously with something like , " Why on Earth would one say something that isn't so ? " Carpenter displays exactly the same shocked surprise when he learns of some of the awful characteristics of human beings , which seems to suggest that before we look for other civilized worlds in the galaxy , maybe we should work a little more on civilizing our own world . The famous quote that I've quoted in my summary line is one of the many delights that this film presents , and Evil Dead fans will be thrilled to see the origins of those strange words that Ash had such a hard time speaking in Army of Darkness . The genre of science fiction has a much larger than average ratio of bad films to good ones , and I think the best ones are the ones that have a concrete connection to the real world , as The Day the Earth Stood Still obviously does . Given the political atmosphere here in the first month of 2005 , it's obvious that humans have not taken much advice from this movie , but then again , as Arnold stated in Terminator 2 , " It's in your nature to destroy yourselves . " Scary .
543990	562732	93779	10.0	A great adventure film in somewhat the same style as other great fantasy adventures like The Neverending Story , The Princess Bride takes us on a wonderful trip along with fascinating and enormously amusing c	I'm not exactly sure what exactly it is that makes The Princess Bride such a spectacular film . Or , at the very least , I just can't pinpoint a single characteristic about it that really rises above all others as the main reason that no one should miss it . Indeed , it has a title that should prove to be remarkably uninteresting to the typical action adventure fan ( okay , MALE action adventure fan ) , but even the most die-hard Die Hard fan would love this film . It is extremely important not to judge this film just because it has such a flowery and dangerously ( at the risk of sounding shallow ) girly name , because it is full of wonderful adventure and even some good killing and violence . Does this belong in this kind of romantic comedy ? Absolutely ! The cover box of the film looks like that of a cheesy romance novel , but the film is truly great from start to finish . And , indeed , the film is very aware of the superficial impression that it leaves , and it even presents it directly through Fred Savage's initial response to his grandfather reading him the story . But as the film goes on , we begin to have the same reaction that Fred has . We can't get enough . Cary Elwes delivers by far the most outstanding performance of his career as Westley , the love-struck servant to Buttercup , a beautiful blonde woman living in a misty romantic fantasy world . Sadly , Elwes ' later career has been punctuated by roles that do not serve him well , especially after such a stunning performance in this role . Liar Liar and Twister come immediately to mind . Robin Wright also gives one of the best performances of her career in her film debut here as Princess Buttercup , but the real quality of the performances that makes the movie so great is the fact that they were able to pack the film full of comic relief ( it was nearly nonstop from start to finish ) without taking anything away from the tension or the overall respectability of the film . It is interesting to consider the polar opposite effect of the comic relief on the vast majority of the James Bond films . Wallace Shawn is absolutely hilarious as Vizzini , the bonehead villain who is completely convinced that he has the whole world figured out , Andre the Giant delivers a lumbering but highly impressive performance as Vizzini's enormous , idiot sidekick , and by far my favorite of all , Mandy Patinkin creates one of the most entertaining and likeable characters created in a film in the entire decade of the 1980s ( ' My name is Inigo Montoya . You killed my father . Prepare to die ! ' ) . This is great stuff . Told as a story read from a book , just like The Neverending Story , The Princess Bride provides a magical mix of romance and fantasy and action and comedy to provide an enormously entertaining film for moviegoers of all ages . The Princess Bride is an absolutely wonderful film that is truly not to be missed .
544087	562732	241527	10.0	Lord of the Stone !	Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was released in close proximity to the great Lord of the Rings , and while this has happened many times before with the general result that one of the two films is widely , although not always correctly , considered inferior to the other ( Independence Day and The Arrival , Armageddon and Deep Impact , etc . ) , this has surprisingly not been the case with these films . Clearly , The Lord of the Rings is a much more mature and bold film , but the first installment in the Harry Potter series is much more than a childish adventure tale . One of the things that really makes it a great film is that the film is so faithful to the book . The writers and director Chris Columbus wisely decided not to take any creative liberties with the material that they had to work with . I am glad to see this , because literary faithfulness is almost always associated with better adapted films , and it's good to know that no one involved with the making of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone felt the need to improve upon a book that has been justifiably described as a ' publishing phenomenon . ' J . K Rowling has created a brilliant adventure masterpiece with her first novel , which she reportedly began writing in some café in England back when she was a struggling single mother , and Chris Columbus has successfully taken on the daunting task of bringing it to the screen . One of the things that Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone has in common with The Lord of the Rings is that they both bring the audience to entirely new worlds , with the added bonus in Harry Potter that we actually start out in the real world ( to some extent ) and travel to the world of witches and wizards with the equally amazed Harry Potter . On a structural level , Harry Potter takes an age-old underdog winning formula and reformulates it to make it interesting again . We get a surprisingly simple version of the good vs . bad structure that Star Wars exemplifies so well as Harry faces off with his pals in Griffindor against the obviously malicious Draco Malfoy ( what a name ! ) and the rest of Slytherin . There is a surprising amount of characterization going on in this film even at the level of their actual names , to such extent that a couple of Draco's loyal goons have names like Crabbe and Goyle . Real charmers , I'm sure . Obviously , in a film with this much fantasy and adventure , there is a definite need for some amount of computer-generated special effects . You just can't have a fight with a fully-grown mountain troll or a game of Quidditch played on broomsticks or a lot of the magic that took place in the movie without them , but thankfully they were wise enough not to take the special effects too far , a mistake the ease of which to make George Lucas is happily proving . The problem with computer-generated images these days is that no matter how huge the budget is or how high tech the images are , they NEVER look completely real . Chris Columbus seems to realize this , as can be seen , for example , in the Quidditch game , in which all of the players zooming around on their brooms are generally shown from a distance , so that the only way that we can tell that they aren't real , with a few exceptions , is that we've never seen someone in real life riding a flying broom . Given the fact that a game played entirely on flying brooms was made to look at least moderately convincing , we're more than willing to forgive the relatively few scenes in which the level of reality slips a little bit ( such as the scene where the mountain troll is hanging Harry by his foot , swinging at him with his club ) . The casting in the film , as well , could not possibly have been better . 12 year-old Daniel Radcliffe perfectly captures the unique character of Harry Potter , and his young friends in the film are portrayed by a series of preteen newcomers as well . The surprising thing here is not only that most of the children with lead roles in the film are very new to film acting , but that Chris Columbus managed to coax such convincing performances out of all of them ( obviously , being fans of wonderful adventure tales such as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone , we all remember director Richard Donner mentioning in the director's commentary on The Goonies DVD that working with children made him contemplate suicide on a daily basis ) . Robbie Coltrane delivers the performance of his career as the lovable Hagrid , the gigantic Gamekeeper with the heart of gold and the clumsily loose tongue , while Richard Harris and Maggie Smith fit so well in their roles that they seem to have been written specifically for them ( each easily reaching the incredible level of precision with which Ian McKellan and Christopher Lee each fit into their respective roles in The Lord of the Rings ) . And , of course , I can't forget Alan Rickman , who is so perfectly cast as Severus Snape that the role could not have been filled half as well by any other actor . Rickman has been unfortunately typecast since his absolutely brilliant performance in Robin Hood : Prince of Thieves , and his role here as Snape is hardly a notch or two below that one . Clearly , Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is aimed at a relatively younger audience , since the books are aimed at a young adult audience , but the film manages to entertain children and adults alike , just as the books are easily enjoyable by any adult who is at least slightly in touch with his or her inner child . It is not often that a book or series of books as fascinating as the Harry Potter books comes along , and it's great to see that , just like The Lord of the Rings , the series is off to a smashing good start . I wish they would make movies out of some of the other adventure books that are just as fun to read as the Harry Potter books , such as The Phantom Tollbooth or The Chronicles of Narnia ( someone's sitting on a gold mine with that one ! ! ) , but for now , I am personally more than content to sit back and watch a new Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings film for the next couple years , and hope that this trend of quality adventure will continue in the future .
544580	562732	420286	10.0	SUPPORT THE TROOPS , NOT THE WAR .	My brother's girlfriend has a sticker on the back of her car which reads ' If you're not completely appalled , you haven't been paying attention . ' This is a movie for those people who are not completely appalled , because if you've been paying attention then you already know most of what this movie has to say . Or maybe I've just been paying attention too much . I never for a second bought the ludicrous story of weapons of mass destruction , not from day one . I had a friend of several years in Fresno that I longer talk to because we got in such a heated discussion about Bush's upcoming war . He thought that at a time of crisis it was important that America supports it's president , I was sure , and still am , that supporting a president as he makes such a massively wrong move could only make it worse . Just because a moron made his way into the White House is no reason to show the world that we are an entire country of morons , because we are not . I like that the movie stays away from the hard line tactics of Michael Moore , placing words in people's mouths and making dangerous assertions in order to get his point across . Moore has good points and its important that people see them , but his methods are not the greatest . Uncovered : The War on Iraq is made up of the testimony of 27 government officials , most of whom were involved in the events that led to this ridiculous war in Iraq , as well as lots of archive footage of top Bush administration officials putting their feet so far in their mouths that they may need to have them surgically removed . It was mere months before Bush gave Hussein his 48 hour warning that both Colin Powell and Condoleeza Rice stated that Saddam had no weapons and no means of obtaining any weapons . Next thing you know he is an imminent threat who could launch WMDs within 45 minutes of giving the order . How can people be so blind ? When Fahrenheit was released , the right wing , particularly radio talk show hosts ( keep your eye out in Uncovered , by the way , for footage of Michael Savage , one of the most hate-filled and nakedly racist men ever allowed near a radio microphone in the history of the medium ) , were so shocked and frightened that they immediately denounced it as things like a ' pack of lies ' ( Rush Limbaugh ) . My question would be something like , Did Bush ever say ' Some call you the elite , I call you my base ' ? Did he ever say that or was that another of Michael Moore's lies ? In Uncovered : The War in Iraq , Director Robert Greenwald leaves no room for such hollow and weak arguments . The film is literally packed with video evidence of top Bush administration officials stating their reasons for the war , which gradually change as their faulty intelligence becomes apparent . First we went to war to rid Hussein of WMDs , then we were in Iraq to free the Iraqi people , then when that failed too we were there to make America safer , which has also failed . What's next ? Oh yeah , Saddam Hussein is a villain and the world is better off without him . Which renders very difficult to explain the footage of Donald Rumsfeld , the SITTING SECRETARY OF DEFENSE , SHAKING HANDS WITH HIM . Hussein was a brutal dictator , that is not a subject of debate , but neither is the fact that Iraq and Hussein had absolutely nothing to do with . This has been staring Bush and America in the face since . Hussein was an ENEMY of Osama bin Laden . But is the world really better off without Hussein in power ? I'll be the first to say that the world may very well be better off without him , but there are two things that I can also say for certain ? Iraq is not better off without him , and America is not better off without him . Iraq has become a haven for terrorists and insurgents and is massively unsafe for everyone within the nation's borders , and Bush has demolished the image of America as a benevolent force in the eyes of the world . We are no longer a benevolent force , we are the bully that no one likes . Hussein had no weapons on mass destruction and Iraq was not a terrorist nation UNTIL America INVADED AND OCCUPIED IT . As Bush himself said in front of lots of rolling cameras , he wouldn't be happy if he were occupied either . But hey , the first rule of politics is that the man who orders the execution never drops the blade , so Bush's total lack of any kind of military combat experience will make no difference as he sends thousands of young Americans to their meaningless deaths with the flick of a pen and an arrogant smirk for the passing cameras . Bush went to war in Iraq , among other selfish reasons , to finish what his father left undone when he lost in 1992 to Bill Clinton , and the movie ends with a powerful quote from a book by George H . W . Bush himself , which stated that a ground war in Iraq would have led to an occupation that would result in countless American deaths and no end in sight . Evidently his son is so against accumulating knowledge that he doesn't even read books written by his own father . Here's something that really gets me , people attack Clinton because bin Laden was offered to him but he wanted to pursue legal means rather than reckless military action , like Bush , so bin Laden wasn't captured and later attacked us on Bush's watch . Rather than go after bin Laden to clean up what supposedly was Clinton's mess , Bush diverts the vast majority of funds and military force AWAY from the pursuit of bin Laden in order to ' use as a reason to go after Iraq ' ( Rumsfeld's words ) , attacking and removing from power a man who had absolutely nothing to do with . Way to go , Bush , because of what you've done , the insurgents planting roadside bombs in Iraq and killing our troops are acting in SELF DEFENSE . The election , which takes place a mere 8 days after the time of this writing , is the most important election in American history . Lives are at stake , and the mere act of voting Bush out of office can perform miraculous work in repairing at least some of the decades and decades of damage that he has done to this country in his four illegitimate years in office . He has destroyed America's image in the eyes of the world , and in the catastrophic event that he wins a second term ( whether by being elected for the first time , or by being wrongly appointed again ) , we will effectively show the world that we as a country agree with his illegal tactics and arrogant foreign policy . It is absolutely IMPERATIVE that this does not happen , and films like Uncovered : The War on Iraq are exactly what we need to stop it .
544894	562732	47478	10.0	Better than The Gammage Cup , Wolves of the Calla , and A Bug's Life combined ! !	Akira Kurosawa's ambitious Seven Samurai is a film that has been emulated and duplicated and imitated in almost every medium you can think of , probably most in books and movies , as in the cases above . It is a classic story of protection and thinly disguised revenge that has tremendous satisfactory power , but Kurosawa knows enough to avoid over-simplifying the impact of his film by introducing fault into the characters being protected . It is never really proved whether or not Kikuchio's ( Toshiro Mifune , a Kurosawa veteran ) assertion that the farmers were not nearly as poor ( and therefore unable to pay them ) as they let on is actually true , but it introduces doubt as to whether they are perfect victims . This is , of course , a movie about people , not about two dimensional characters , and any forward thinking village is going to try to save up whatever wealth or food that they can compile in order to ensure their own survival . I won't pretend to understand completely what compels samurai to do what they do , to risk their lives for such little ( if any ) reward , but I know that it is something that is almost universally accepted by samurais , and if I'm not mistaken , the samurai that abandon that code are known as Ronin , a not very enviable title . The movie is definitely something of a commitment at three and a half hours , but it flows smoothly and it takes the time to get to know its characters , which allows it to present the real world so much more clearly , and I was surprised to find that one of the most powerful scenes in the entire film took place in the last minute or two of the movie . This is an intense anti-war film that allows you to identify with three different sides in battle , the victims , the protectors , and the oppressors ( although that third not quite as much ) , and I think that one of the most important things that it does is that it provides a look into an ancient Japanese culture and makes an assertion about what may have happened that allowed for more flexibility in their culture rather than a strict adherence to established traditions , much like Chinua Achebe does in his novel Things Fall Apart , but I digress . One of the things that is introduced very early in the film is the fact that samurai are not entirely trusted by the villagers , and it is strictly forbidden that they mix with their culture , they are treated almost as subhumans , but their battlefield prowess is intensely desired . When a conflict arises about a local man's daughter becoming involved with a young samurai who is there to protect the village , he demands action and retribution , but the well-being of the rest of the village is deemed more important . There is a lot going on in the movie in terms of societal roles in Japanese culture , which affects the way things pan out in the movie ( although Kurosawa was known for rebelling against such expectations , particularly later in his career ) , and like so many of Kurosawa's films , there is so much going at so many levels that multiple viewings of the film will reveal more and more things going on that went unnoticed on the first time . Argued by many to be Kurosawa's greatest film , The Seven Samurai is certainly one among many .
544161	562732	133093	10.0	HELL YEAH ! ! !	Finally a science fiction film that cannot be immediately dismissed as either unreal or impossible . How can anyone say that this isn't exactly the way that reality is ? To try and disprove this view of reality would be like trying to disprove the existence of God . Maybe he's there , maybe he isn't , but no one can possibly prove it either way . It works the same way for The Matrix . It is possible that everything that we see is fed into our minds by machines and that we would never know it . Probably the only remotely convincing argument the other way would be that if that were true , why would the machines give us a movie like this to watch ? It would expose them ! But then again , maybe they just want to get us thinking , maybe to see how we'll react to the possibility of their existence . Maybe they are getting ready to present themselves to us . Robot rapture ! Who can say that the Wachowski brothers are not messengers ? This is by far the best science fiction film that I have ever seen . Aside from the relatively plausible story , every other element of the film was spectacular ! The special effects ( which , in my opinion , usually take more away from a film than they add ) were awesome , the fight scenes were incredibly intense , and the pace of the film itself was breathtaking . Every hole is covered up brilliantly , even down to a definition of deja-vu and a possible reason for why so many different foods taste like chicken . These little ties to reality are one of the best ways that this film was able to come off so realistically . The Matrix is absolutely not to be missed . Even people who don't like science fiction or even action films will more than likely enjoy this film . It is well presented , it is not unnecessarily excessive , and it presents the most innovative camera work in years . It has something for everyone , and will become a science fiction classic without a doubt .
543753	562732	47396	10.0	One of Hitchcock's best . Nearly as great as Psycho .	Rear Window is Alfred Hitchcock's comment on the voyeuristic quality of society ( ' We've become a race of peeping toms ? ' ) . It is the story of a man bound to a wheelchair by a broken leg who sees what he believes to be a murder being covered up in an apartment across the courtyard from him . James Stewart delivers an excellent performance as L . B . ' Jeff ' Jeffries , the magazine photographer who is bound to a wheelchair and who finds himself spying on his neighbors , at first out of boredom but very soon out of strong suspicion . This is a very talky thriller and is limited entirely to what is seen from Jeff's large apartment window . The fact that the entire two-hour film takes place in such a small setting is a strong statement about Hitchcock's tremendous skills as a director . He makes the film interesting in countless ways , such as his excellent , meaningful use of shadows , the very thorough character development , his interesting use of symbolism ( such as Jeff's difficulty in reaching itches underneath his cast ) , not to mention the amazingly effective suspense , a Hitchcock trademark . Just before Jeff notices some suspicious events occurring across the courtyard , he is constantly complaining about not being able to find any interesting work as a photographer , and it is ironic that he soon finds something interesting right outside his own window , and while he is confined to a wheelchair , no less . The fascinating crime story of the man across the courtyard having murdered his wife is made even creepier by the fact that it is all deducted from behavior that Jeff sees out his window , and we don't even find out for sure if he is right or not until the film's exciting climax . Hitchcock fans are also likely to notice a line of dialogue that may have foreshadowed some of the events that were to later take place in Psycho , such as the insurance company nurse's speculation that the killer must have cut up his wife's body in the bathtub ( ' That's the only place he could have washed away the blood ? ' ) . Another thing that sets Rear Window aside from other thrillers ( including its own 1998 re-make which , incidentally , was far superior to the 1998 re-make of Psycho ) , was the way that it had several stories going on at the same time , which is one of the ways that it was able to remain so interesting . Jeff is an injured photographer , he is unsatisfied with his work , he is having a dilemma about marrying his sweetheart because he feels she is too perfect for him ( the flimsiest excuse on the planet , of course , but he actually makes it make a little bit of sense ) , and then he comes across these events across the courtyard from his apartment that make him think that there has been a murder over there , and the murderer ( Raymond Burr ) is trying to cover it up . Some of the things that happen in this film are not perfect , or seem uncharacteristic of Hitchcock , but the film as a whole is still spectacularly effective . For example , as a Hitchcock scholar , I found it strange that the killer strangled the dog and left it in the middle of the courtyard for all to see ( and for Jeff to make revealing conclusions about ) . Think about how much more effective this would have been if the woman who owned the dog had just stood out on her porch calling for him , and he never came . This way , the realization that the man had killed the dog would have been much more gradually realized , and may have made the suspense created by it that much more impressive . At any rate , this is an outstanding film , and Hitchcock definitely created an amazing amount of suspense with such limited means , leading up to a tremendous climax that provided a quick but satisfying ending to this classic film .
544128	562732	81398	10.0	Brought to you by PBR !	Frank McCourt claims that no one in America admits that they drink Pabst . I don't know that that's true , but it does seem to have been relegated to what we called " frat beer " when I was in college . In 1941 , however , when Raging Bull takes place , it seems to have been a much bigger brand , at least that's the impression I get when seeing it as a major sponsor at major sporting events . Robert DeNiro stars as the enormously insecure Jake LaMotta , a young boxing legend who has trouble separating his boxing life with his private life . Raging Bull walks a fine line between being a boxing movie and a social drama , as we switch back and forth between LaMotta's turbulent boxing career and his steadily disintegrating personal life . The boxing scenes are magnificent even though Scorsese didn't pick up on Hitchcock's infamous chocolate syrup prop , giving us huge amounts of blood ( in typical Scorsese style ) that looks like water ( not typical Scorsese style ) . He also makes great use of super slow motion flashbulbs , which seems to be one of his recurring motifs . More than anything else , the movie is a fascinating portrayal of what fame can do to someone who doesn't deserve it , or can't handle it . At the beginning of the movie , Jake is a young boxing hero and we want to root for him . Then as the movie progresses he reveals his true self ? unpredictable , alcoholic , spontaneously violent , and generally just the kind of guy that no one in their right mind would want to be associated with . Even his own brother ( in a brilliant performance by Joe Pesci ) is uncomfortable around him because he's always doing some bizarre thing , like demanding that he punch him in the face repeatedly . Through his own uncontrollable outbursts and inability to maintain his composure , his boxing career disintegrates , leaving him a burned out has-been with no idea how to handle the money he has left over . He opens a nightclub ( can you guess what he called it ? ) and becomes a total dirtbag . All the stops have been pulled out by now , he no longer cares about anything , even the law , and he begins making stupid mistakes . He allows a 14-year-old girl to drink in his club because she's a good kisser , and ultimately lands himself in solitary . What's a 14-year-old girl doing in a nightclub anyway ? LaMotta's problems all seem to stem from his sense of invincibility . He doesn't believe anyone can beat him in the ring and taunts his opponents . He believes he is all-powerful in his personal life and ends up frightening the ones he loves and driving them away . And eventually he doesn't believe that even the police can harm him , so he flaunts his indifference to the law when an underage girl comes to his nightclub . " What're they gonna do ? " he asks . And then we cut to him in prison , where he belongs . In solitary , obviously , he hits rock bottom , and in the movie's most painful scene he has a total mental and physical breakdown , slamming his head repeatedly against the wall . When he gets out he returns to the club scene as a completely useless stand-up comedian , and when his audience boos him he responds with insults , which is exactly his problem . He is the result of being ultra-famous and yet having no showman's talent whatsoever beyond the ability to hit people really hard . In the end , we come back to the beginning of the movie , which showed an older and significantly fatter LaMotta in his dressing room preparing to go out on stage . He chants over and over again something of which he now has to convince even himself ?
544844	562732	103939	10.0	A spectacular portrayal of the unseen life of Charlie Chaplin .	Robert Downey Jr . , first of all , portrays Chaplin with amazing accuracy . Some parts of this performance are particularly memorable , such as his invention of the famous tramp's walk just after having feverishly picked out the outfit , the astonishingly accurate depiction of Charlie as an old man , and of course , the many parts of the film that involve parts of his life where he was working on his own films . These are clearly some of the most interesting parts of the movie , if only because these films are how we know him , but it is at least as interesting the way that the film hints towards things that happened in Chaplin's life that inspired those films . Very early in the film , we see a scene in which Charlie's mother is booed off the stage by an impatient crowd , so Charlie , who is a little boy at the time , gets on stage to do a song and dance of his own . He performs a song that is very similar to the one his mother performed , but he wins the audience's heart and they respond by tossing coins onto the stage for him . You can't help noticing how this corresponds with the constantly youthful look of the Tramp ( in Modern Times , for example , Chaplin was in his late 40s but looked like a teenager ) , and the coins tossed on stage may have played a significant role in helping him realize that this could be a good way to make money . Charlie moves to America to pursue his dream , and we see the landmark events that punctuated his dizzying rise to stardom . He goes to work briefly on stage and is then hired by Mack Sennett , a gigantic figure in film history , but is unsatisfied because of his own lack of control over his work . It should also be noted here that there is a scene where he is working with director Mabel Normand , who demands acting from him that he does not agree with , and with whom he clashes . In 1914 , Chaplin starred in a 9 ½ minute film called Mabel's Busy Day , in which he plays the uncharacteristic role of the antagonist . The Mabel in this film is a sporting event vendor who turns down Charlie's amorous advances , after which Charlie proceeds to steal all of her products and hand them out to anyone standing nearby . Then in 1920 , he starred in another short comedy called Mabel's Strange Predicament , in which Mabel is a woman who becomes locked out of her hotel room in her pajamas and ends up avoiding the drunken Charlie for the rest of the film . In both films , Charlie plays uncharacteristic roles , the most unenviable of which was in Mabel's Busy Day , which Mabel Norman directed . Later in the film we see Charlie in a small diner just after having terminated his employment with Mack Sennett , and he meets Edna Purviance in a scene that is reminiscent of his romantic endeavors in such early films as Caught In A Cabaret and , even more so , The Immigrant , one of his most famous early films . There are dozens of other references to the development of his cinematic personality - such as his sudden realization of how to make the Tramp appear rich to the blind girl in City Lights without talking , as well as the dance of the dinner rolls , which Charlie performs here at a dinner at an expensive restaurant - but there is an even more significant portrayal of Charlie's beliefs and his values in this movie that are more recognizable as well as more memorable to people not familiar with his earlier and less known work . Charlie Chaplin was one of many filmmakers ' in the earlier times of the medium that resented and disapproved of the coming of sound to the movies . His Tramp remains one of the most recognized figures in the history of the cinema , and it is widely known that the Tramp is an almost entirely silent character , so it is necessary for a film about Chaplin's life to address this in some way , and it is done perfectly here . There is a scene where Charlie's brother is trying to convince him to add spoken dialogue into his films and Charlie refuses outright , giving a hilarious example of a Russian ballet dancer and saying , ' The Tramp CAN'T talk . The minute he talks , he's dead . ' This is a brilliant way to illustrate Charlie's fondness for the silent film , as well as his knowledge that no voice given to the Tramp would fit his character right . He was too well known to be changed so profoundly . Charlie Chaplin created 81 movies in his lifetime , many of them timeless and truly memorable , and has made a significant impact on the filmmaking medium as well as on the world itself . He was a fascinating personality both onscreen and off , which is another element of his life that was necessarily and skillfully presented in this film , this time directly in the dialogue in what is probably the single most important line in the entire film ? ' If you want to understand me , watch my movies . ' Chaplin's ever-present sympathy for the underprivileged is subtly but effectively portrayed as two poor people approach him on his way out of a nice restaurant , right at the beginning of the Great Depression , asking for his autograph . The elderly Charlie notes in retrospect that , ' I wish they'd wanted my money . ' He is always aware throughout the film and throughout his life of the difficulties constantly facing poor people , and he wants to give these people not only an escape with his films , but hope for the future . There is a point in the film where Charlie has returned to Europe to see an old friend , and he learns on the train that she has died . He is then asked , ' What'll we do , Charlie ? ' And his answer , although spoken under his breath almost in a whisper , rings louder than anything else in the film . ' Smile . '
544025	562732	408368	10.0	These people do good work !	I would say that we can never have too many shows like this , but that's not really true . If we have a show like this in every city it would start to look like TV networks just cashing in on the latest trend , and I think the work that the people are doing on the show is far too important to be trivialized like that . I have only seen a few episodes , but it is always uplifting to see people whose lives are centered on seeing that animals receive humane treatment in a very human world . I have a feeling sometimes that people will watch the show and see something like several educated and professional people fretting over the well-being of a 24-hour old baby rabbit and think , " doesn't the world have enough rabbits already ? " But the message of the show is that , especially in a society like America , humans are very much in control of the environment , particularly that of domesticated animals , and there are people who severely mistreat or neglect their animals and it's good to see that those animals are taken from those people , and as often as possible , the people are properly punished for their shabby behavior . I also like the way the show is structured . We see an introduction to a problem with an animal or some animals being maltreated or tortured or just living in an inhumane condition , and then the investigators go to check it out . Rather than just telling one story at a time , they introduce each story and then move on to the next , coming back to the different stories throughout the show and ultimately ending with a conclusion , which is as happy as circumstances allow . Generally the animals are treated and adopted into happier families , although there are cases where they have to be put to sleep . All my life I have had a very deep love of animals , so it's nice to see a show that is dedicated to their well being . The show is alternately heart wrenching and uplifting , and I like to think that even though there are only TV shows in a few cities , this kind of work is being done all over the country . Bravo !
544244	562732	280778	10.0	" If one doesn't have words how does one think ? "	Iris is one of those dramas that is so startlingly well acted and accurate to reality that you truly see the people on screen suffering through the story rather than the actors portraying them . And in a film that stars Judi Dench , that is a remarkable achievement . Dench and Kate Winslet are made to look so similar that when the film jumps back and forth between past and present , which it does quite often , it is never jarring no matter how abrupt it is . The young Iris , played by Winslet , is similar to the character that she played in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind in many ways . She is sexually adventurous without being promiscuous , independent without being unfriendly or unattached , and dependent without being needy or reliant . She ultimately pursues a successful career as a novelist , which serves to illustrate her love and dependence on words and to enhance the effect of her deterioration later in the film . Iris is famously a study of Alzheimer's disease , which is the kind of thing that rarely makes its way into mainstream films , so it is that much more moving that a movie as brilliant as this one takes on the subject and brings it to the forefront in such a dramatic fashion . Iris goes from being a tremendously successful novelist to not understanding which side of an open door she should pass in order to get through it . As she loses touch with reality and experiences more and more difficulty in speaking and understanding , the most moving scenes are the ones that show the suffering that her husband goes through before his own deterioration . Iris has spent her life exploring things like what it is that makes people happy and what makes them realize that they are happy once they are , and then shows as she loses touch with those things without even realizing it . Her husband , John Bayley , in a brilliant performance by Jim Broadbent , is the only man who she has ever been with that has truly loved her , and he is the one that has to watch her cognitive abilities decline . He is literally watching the love of his life slip away from him without her even realizing it . The film is beautifully shot and the musical score enhances the film spectacularly and unobtrusively . It brings out the emotions in a movie about losing not only memory , but about losing the your identity , losing yourself . The gradual nature of the onset of Alzheimer's disease is one of the most brilliantly presented elements in the film . There is a conversation that Iris and her husband have in which she gives him a quote , which he responds to in a way that shows his own mental decline , and then Iris ' as well . Iris - " Between two evils always choose the one you haven't tried before . " John - " Mae West . Oh my vest ! I tore my vest again this morning ! " Iris - " You must get some new vests . " John ? " Jolly good ? " Iris ? " You must get some new vests , " then , surprised at herself , " I just said that . " This all kind of makes me wonder , because it is not very rare that I will ask someone a question that I already asked and they already answered , sometimes only a minute or two before , and when they tell me I just asked them that question I have to explain that I just wasn't sure if I had asked them out loud or just thought the question in my head . Where the answer ever went in my brain remains a mystery . It is very important that the movie spends so much time showing how much of a fiercely intelligent philosopher ( in Kate Winslet's words ) Iris Murdock was , because it emphasizes the totality with which Alzheimer's affects her ability to think . As a young woman she could talk circles around people , but when she grew older and Alzheimer's began to set in she became confused by the simplest concepts , and the difficulty that her husband found in attempting to explain things to her and hide what must have been his overwhelming emotion . I'm in the middle of reading a wonderful book by Sidney Lumet called Making Movies , and I just finished a chapter on actors , in which there is a section where he described some actors who believe so strongly in the material of a film that they will do whatever it takes to get the movie made . Many actors have taken salaries far below their usually asking prices in order to participate in a movie about which they felt very strongly , and Iris is one of those movies , although I don't know whether or not any of the actors took smaller salaries than they deserved . There is a short documentary on the DVD called ' A Look at Iris ' in which the cast and crew talk about the movie , and it is clear how strongly they feel about the film . Kate Winslet nails it on the head in one clip , where she says that she knows that people who knew the real Iris Murdock would see the movie , so it was all the more important that she get the character exactly right . I love that . In Iris's own words , " If one doesn't have words how does one think ? " That's exactly the question that this movie so touchingly explores . It is about people loving and then losing each other with torturous slowness , in one of the most moving and important films of 2001 .
544694	562732	267721	10.0	Excellent look back .	Clearly , the most difficult thing about making supplemental documentaries about movies that were made as long ago as Bridge on the River Kwai is that there is so little to work with . With DVDs and even home video in the distant future , on set interviews were much more rare than they are today , but Director Laurent Bouzereau displays great skills in matching up interviews of cast or , more often , crew members talking about certain things that happened during the making of the film and then following them up with those particular scenes from the movie . A similar tactic was used to great success in the making of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid , which at least had interviews with both Paul Newman and Robert Redford , although they were audio only . This documentary follows the making of the film from the initial translation of the original novel into English ( from French ) and then into an actual screenplay , which was scrapped and then started over again from scratch , to the screening of the finished film , where some great tricks were pulled on some lazy critics . I recently saw Hotel Rwanda at a screening in Hollywood and one of the actors from the film was at the screening , and he told a story about the writers of the movie having been trying to find somebody to get interested in their script for something like five or six years , which was astounding to me because Hotel Rwanda is probably one of the two or three most powerful films I've ever seen . There is a similar story in the case of Bridge on the River Kwai , and this documentary goes into detail about the difficulties that the movie had being made . Not only was Alec Guinness near the bottom of the list of preferred actors for the lead role , but he wasn't interested much in the project himself to begin with . There are some great stories about Sessue Hayakawa , who played Col . Saito in the film . Hayakawa is a well known silent film actor who had been acting for four decades by the time he appeared in this film , but this is by far the role that he is most known for . He made dozens of movies in the 1910s , like Chaplin did , which really makes me want to see some of them . The documentary also explains the importance of the train wreck to the film as well as the difficulty in planning it . Even for blowing up a bridge and sending a full sized locomotive plummeting into the river it was a surprisingly complex plan , made even more difficult by the fact that no one really knew how powerful the explosion was going to be . Naturally , as is just the case when making movies , not everything goes according to plan , and this documentary has some great stories to tell about how a great story was made into a movie .
544679	562732	49406	10.0	" Ain't fair . Ain't fair . "	The first thing that struck me about The Killing is that the narration really doesn't seem to fit , which explains why Kubrick was so unhappy about being obliged to include it . My initial reaction upon learning this was to wonder why Kubrick would put up with someone forcing him to do something in one of his films that he didn't like , but then I remembered that this was very early in his career , and no one really knew who he was yet . Right away we meet an obviously unhappy couple , Sherry and George , and quickly learn why they are unhappy . Sherry has no respect for George because he had promised her a good life and a lot of money and has as of yet failed to do that . She belittles him and manipulates him , treating him like an irritating servant rather than as a husband . It is painfully obvious that he should drop her like a bad habit , but he is so in love with her that he takes it and continues to make her promises , even knowing that in order to fulfill them he will have to take a dangerous trip to the wrong side of the law . The build-up of the scheme to rob the race track is one of the film's greatest achievements , and Sherry manages to manipulate George into telling her about it , and then she immediately goes off to tell her lover about it as well . It is an interesting love triangle described here . Sherry is having an affair with a handsome stud but married to a whiny pansy who reminds me of Piglet from the Winnie the Pooh cartoons . George is desperately in love with Sherry , who has no respect for him , but is in turn in love with Val , a handsome man who clearly is only interested in her physically . At least until she mentions George's scheme to steal hundreds of thousands of dollars . Then he's interested in her financially , too . We know Sherry plans to betray George , and we can sense that Val intends to betray Sherry , which makes for some great dramatic tension later in the film . George is so intent on getting to trust his promise that things will get better that he doesn't think for a second that she would ever betray him , even when she is so clearly uninterested in him beyond the possibility that he may bring some money into her life . At one point he tells her , " I know I've made a lot of promises in the past , but this time it's not just talk . We're gonna be rich , and soon ! " This may have been emulated in a classic Simpsons episode , where Homer says almost exactly the same thing ? " After years of failing at get-rich-quick schemes , I KNOW I'm gonna get rich with THIS scheme . And quick ! " Kubrick has explored an astonishing variety of genres in his career , ranging from the beginning of time to the distant future and from sports films to science fiction . This one , I think , is his only film noir , and it is film noir by the strictest definition . I often notice that , with surprising regularity , it is women , or a woman , the generates much of the conflict in the movies , but here is a very clearly defined femme fatale that leads to the downfall of a doting man . ( spoilers ) There is a scene that suggests an ugly hint of racism , as the man hired to shoot one of the horses during the race ( and thus create the necessary distraction ) tells a polite black parking lot attendant to get lost in the ugliest way possible . I was a little disappointed to hear this kind of language in a Kubrick film , although it does fit in perfectly with the story and , more importantly , these are the last words the man ever says . Serves him right . This is Kubrick making social commentary in his own brilliant way . Very soon , he does it again , skewering corrupt or inept police and biased news outlets , which claim that the man was shot as he " attempted to shoot his way out of the parking lot . " As can be expected , everything does not turn out to plan , and Kubrick has created a brilliant ending that is both disappointing and hugely satisfying . Disappointing because the tension was created throughout by causing us to wonder whether or not the robbery would be successful , and satisfying because , even though we didn't really even notice it until now , none of the characters are very likable . Except maybe for that parking lot attendant . After all that planning , it seems , you can't account for every contingency ? Note : The eagle-eyed viewer will notice Rodney Dangerfield as an extra during the fight scene . I may be mistaken , but it looks to me like he is the man the second from the right just after the guy fighting flips two cops forward onto their backs at once .
544155	562732	117381	10.0	This is an absolutely amazing film . However , it is also tragically underrated .	Primal Fear is one the best films that I have seen in years . Richard Gere portrays a glamorous attorney handling a case that has horrified the public and which seems to be a slam-dunk . He seems to be the only person who believes that young Aaron Stampler did not murder Archbishop Richard Rushman , a grisly crime which is tastefully portrayed at the beginning of the film . Edward Norton , in particular , was startlingly convincing as Stampler . This was really his chance to let the world know what a phenomenal actor he was and still is . Unfortunately , this film did not get the recognition that it deserved , which may have been a reason why Norton's next film , American History X , was also not as big as it should have been . Edward Norton was about 98 % of the reason to watch both of these films , which were both absolutely amazing and intense . Primal Fear is a film that can be enjoyed by pretty much anyone . The story is so well-told and well-acted that it holds your attention firmly and does not even begin to let go for all 130 minutes . It easily achieves the level of intensity that is desired by all mysteries and thrillers , with an ending that is both shocking and disturbing . Primal Fear is destined to become a classic , regardless of how relatively unknown it may be . This can be said about an extremely small number of films , but no matter what kind of movie you enjoy , if you haven't seen Primal Fear , go out and find it . You will not be disappointed .
544278	562732	86567	10.0	A classic computer film that has stood the test of time remarkably well , considering the fact that it's a computer thriller .	Wargames is one of those young adult films that manages to span just about all ages of movie fans with its sense of adventure mixed with a chilling sense of reality . Kind of like The Goonies , it is a movie that finds a young kid in an extraordinary situation , except that rather than the Indiana Jones type adventure that the Goonies go on , David ( a young Matthew Broderick ) has inadvertently come frighteningly close to starting a massive nuclear war between the United States and Russia . We meet David early in the film after a tense missile launch training sequence ( in which the men on hand do not realize that they are only participating in a training drill ) . David is a typical high school boy , bored to death by school but fascinated to no end by computers , even the now-prehistoric dinosaur that he had operating at home . One of the things that I liked about this movie , in fact , was that it made my computer look so high tech ! Obviously , any movie that deals with computers is going to be outdated in a few years , and Wargames is certainly no exception . Consider , for example , the fact that David's girlfriend was so fascinated by the concept of a speaker that she picked it up and looked at it from all angles , completely amazed . You can see this in any number of movies , such as the similarly ancient computers in Weird Science and , probably the most amusing , the massive , brick-sized cellular telephone that Wesley Snipes used in true gangster style in New Jack City . Technology is an amusing thing , especially when it's taken so seriously in the movies and then is so completely obsolete a decade or so later . Wargames , however , despite being jam-packed with outdated machinery and computer technology , is no less potent as a military thriller , because the technology is not the point of the film . Instead , the movie tells the story of how David goes searching for video games on the 1983 version of the Internet , only to accidentally stumble upon a top-secret military database , WOPR ( endearingly referred to as ' Whopper ' ) that runs hypothetical sequences of what World War III would look like , including how the Russians would react to American reactions to their actions , and so forth . The process by which this machine can do this is one of the few things that's left relatively unclear in the movie , which is probably a good thing , because it sounds suspiciously like something that a computer even today would have a hard time doing . Imagine the staggering amount of information that would have to be entered into a computer for it to achieve that level of intelligence . At any rate , wanting nothing but some new video games and to impress a girl , David searches for video games on what appears to be the web's only search engine ( and , indeed , it's only feature at all ) , and stumbles onto such titles as Backgammon , Chess , Guerrilla Warfare and , of course , Global Thermonuclear War . Naturally , being a high school kid , he's fascinated and wants to play the biggest baddest one . Probably the most hair-raising scene in the film is when David's mother calls him downstairs and congratulates him on passing his classes ( which he had changed by hacking into the school's computer system ) , by which he is thrilled until he turns to look at the TV , where the news is reporting the war that has been set in motion because of his tinkering on the computer . Wargames requires a substantial suspension of disbelief because of such things like the United States military's inability to tell whether or not those blips coming from Russia on their screens are real weapons of mass destruction of if they're just a computer game , but the fact that the world is tottering so lightly on the edge of Global Thermonuclear War , even if only because of the very presence of these types of weapons , is the frightening concept that the movie tries to get across . It focuses on the possibility that something like that could have happened , and it rings chillingly true to this day , no matter how much more advanced our technology is . Sure , it's not likely that the governments of the United States and of Russia or any other countries are likely to launch weapons that will kill millions of people simply based on a few lights that have lighted up on their switchboard , but the weapons are there , and someone paid a lot of money for them . Wargames is an enormously entertaining thriller that poses a question about humanity , with the answer from WOPR that , like Tic Tac Toe , there is no winning move in war . We see it playing through World War III on the military intelligence screens near the end of the film ( during which it evidently has a field day messing with the lighting in the room ) showing missiles coming from every direction and destroying everything on the map . ' This is a strange game , ' it says . ' The only winning move is not to play . How about a nice game of chess ? '
544062	562732	50083	10.0	" Prejudice always obscures the truth . "	It seems that the message of 12 Angry Men ( above ) comes across as the film's only weakness . It starts with the very close of a trial that we never see and convenes immediately into the jury room , where we spend the rest of the movie . It seems an open and shut case , and by a show of hands , there are 11 jury members convinced that the defendant is guilty , and a single man who believes not that he is NOT guilty just that there is a CHANCE that he's not guilty . The film's weakness comes in because it seems that every single person who believes the kid is guilty ultimately reveals that they have some kind of personal vendetta and want to secure a conviction regardless of the sureness of the truth . The problem here is that people who believe in guilty are bad guys ( and they rarely let you forget this , as one or two of them increasingly show off as brutish jerks , while the calm , endlessly likable Henry Fonda heads up the good guy side . Maybe the movie should have been called 11 Angry Men instead . There is also a certain level of ham-handedness involved in the initial presentation of how little the case means to most of the jurors . The story is about how important such legal cases are , because the decision that they make in that room will change someone's life forever , and it is absolutely imperative that they make the right decision . But at the beginning , all of the jurors have their minds somewhere else . They're talking about sports or their jobs or some other casual subject , and it takes one brave juror to stand up to the rest and get them to pay attention and think about what they are about to do . Sidney Lumet , in his book Making Movies , gives us invaluable insight into his goals and experience making 12 Angry Men , including the positioning of the camera ( watch for the appearance of the ceiling late in the film as the tension mounts ) and his brilliant use of lighting . Late in the movie , as the jurors remain in the room until darkness falls outside , it is so gradual and so cleverly done that we don't even realize the movie is getting darker and darker until they flip the lights on , and when they do , it's not just the room that is lighting up . The performances themselves have not aged well , but it is a brilliant analysis of some facts that seemed to so obviously point to one foregone conclusion , although I have to say that the film's other weakness is that a lot of the facts that they re-analyze ( or analyze for the first time ) should have been ridiculously obvious in the original courtroom trial . The jurors question for the first time , for example , the eyesight of the case's key eyewitness , who claims to have seen the murder take place at night and through the windows of a passing elevated train . I should hope that such a situation would have been scrutinized more closely by even the most inexperienced defense attorney , but maybe that person was secretly hoping for a conviction , too . At any rate , the film is a brilliant achievement , given that it is so engaging even though it literally never leaves the room . It reminds us of the importance of certainty in trials , even when the result seems completely obvious . The end of the movie is perfect , as there is only one way that it could really end ( and I don't mean the jury's final decision ) , and yet it is not predictable . This is one of Lumet's most glowing achievements .
544707	562732	365601	10.0	Interesting look back .	I get the feeling that this retrospective documentary was made as a TV spot in response to the tremendous success of Terminator 2 , which was released the year before this documentary was made . As is almost always the case with these making-of or retrospective documentaries that often accompany movies on DVD , this one has garnered a ridiculously and inexplicably low user rating on the IMDb . Once again , here is a documentary that is vastly superior to the rating that people have given it on this site . Whenever I rate one of these documentaries , because they vary so much in their subject matter , I always try to concentrate mostly on whether or not it succeeds in delivering what it sets out to deliver , especially according to the title . What I can't stand is when someone makes a documentary and then gives it a clever sounding title that ends up having almost nothing to do with what is actually in it ( see " Making the Earth Stand Still " ) . This one is exactly what it claims to be , a documentary about the creation of the Terminator , the distinction from " making " the Terminator being that this is not about the making of the movie as much as it is about the conceptualization of the character and some of the things that Arnold and James Cameron discussed during production as far as who the Terminator should be and how he should act . James Cameron came up with the idea of the Terminator while he was down with the sickness in a Rome hotel room , so he was able to relate to Reese and the Terminator being in a foreign environment since they were from the future . They both tell some pretty interesting stories about production , such as the fact that the hardest thing for Arnold was not any of the extensive stunt work but the few scenes where he had acid poured over him so that he would be smoking , as well as the fact that the production offices wanted more of the movie to take place at night to save money on shooting , but Cameron held out because he thought it was important for the style of the movie that it take place mostly at night . Good thing , too ! All in all this is a very interesting documentary , even though it is simply made . All it really is is a conversation between Cameron and Arnold as they talk about the movie and their experiences involved with it , with various clips from the film edited in to complement what they are talking about . I am always suspicious of supplemental documentaries that include too much footage from the movie you just finished watching , but they are provided in a very complementary way in this documentary . Arnold and Cameron are talking about the production of the concept of the movie just as much as the shooting process itself , so it's not a problem that there is no behind-the-scenes footage . Very informative and interesting .
543887	562732	381061	10.0	( best bond ever )	So the reason my summary line is lower case and in parentheses is because initially I had it all in capital letters followed by your everyday period , but the IMDb politely told me DO NOT SHOUT in your summary line . So it's a whisper . Happy now ? Anyway , when I say that Casino Royale is the best Bond ever , I mean that it's the best film , although I would argue that Daniel Craig is also one of the best actors to play James Bond , maybe second only to Sean Connery . He fits the role of a younger 007 with such flawless precision that it's amazing to me that there is any controversy at all about his casting . I have heard that there were a lot of people that were upset that they cast a blonde guy in the role of 007 , but that just strikes be as such a shallow and ridiculous complaint that I don't bother to take it seriously . Having watched Die Another Day just before watching Casino Royale again , I am struck by how much more realistic the plot of this film is . There is nothing totally outlandish about the villain or the plot , and Bond is not presented as an infallible superspy . In fact , I think that's one of the best things about the movie . It's a prequel to all of the preceding films in the series , and Bond has just received his 00 status . Craig gives us a portrayal of James Bond that's totally different from anything we've ever seen before . He's reckless and unpredictable , he allows his emotions to control him and he makes drastic mistakes . Craig gives us a younger and less experienced 007 , showing us some of the formative experiences that made him into the character that we have come to know and love . Bond is embarking on his first mission since being granted 00 status , and his learning experience is not without difficulties . A man named Le Chiffre makes a living by bankrolling terrorists , and after losing $100 million of his terrorist investors ' money in a botched attempt to destroy a prototype plane that would revolutionize the air travel industry , he has to win back the money in a high - stakes poker game or face their wrath . I just have to say that it's amazing that a Bond film that's about 30 minutes longer than the average 007 movie can be centered around a card game and still flow so smoothly and so quickly . Despite having not the slightest interest in poker , I was never for a second bored during the card playing scenes , which should tell you something about how well-made the movie is . Le Chiffre is also one of the best villains of the series . He's scarred and has a bad eye that occasionally leaks blood ( although he assures one of his investors early in the movie , " Weeping blood is only because of a deranged tear duct , nothing sinister . " Right ! ) . He has no plans for world domination of global destruction , but is instead in the very real world position of a bank-roller of terrorist organizations . After the botched attempt to destroy a prototype airplane and thus generate a tremendous amount of money in the stock market , Le Chiffre instead loses more than $100 million , so he sets out to use his tremendous mathematical ingenuity to win back the money in the high - stakes poker game . MI6 sends Bond to participate in the game , informing him that if he loses , the British government will have directly financed terrorism . The stunningly beautiful Eva Green stars as Vesper Lynd , who must surely be the classiest and most intelligent Bond girl ever , as well as the one with the most important and unique role and impact on Bond's life . Bond's experience in knowing her is not always good but it has an effect on him that affects who he is , and no Bond girl has ever done that before , except maybe for the woman Bond married in On Her Majesty's Secret Service in 1969 . Best one-liner : Bond : " Vodka martini . " Bartender : " Shaken or stirred ? " Bond : " Do I look like I give a damn ? " By the way , can I just ask one question ? Why doesn't anyone EVER do CPR right in the movies ?
544680	562732	361862	10.0	Brilliant moody trip through a damaged mind .	This has to be one of Christian Bale's most memorable performances . I have read that he lost nearly 70 pounds for the role , which is an astonishing amount of weight and supposedly the most that any actor has deliberately lost for any role in a movie in film history . His appearance is frightening in itself , with his protruding bones and sunken eyes , he inhabits the role of a man struggling with severe insomnia and an increasing array of other problems . He has a job as a machinist and it is not pleasant work . It's repetitive and dark and boring , and he tends not to get along with his colleagues so well . He seems a little out of place , even a little confused by his surroundings , and becomes increasingly distracted by various strange occurrences . I love that Bale's character's name is Trevor Reznik , named after Trent Reznor , the singer of Nine Inch Nails , one of my favorite bands . I hear that they were sought after to do the soundtrack but they decided not to go in that direction with the movie . It's too bad , too , because Nine Inch Nails could not possibly do anything bad to a movie like this . There is an intense scene in the film where Trevor is giving a ' hand ' to a co-worker named Miller , when he gets distracted and bumps into a power button , activating a machine which then won't stop , and Miller loses an arm at the elbow . It's a grisly , painful scene to watch , and it is a major turning point in the movie and Trevor ' life . Later , Miller is able to make feeble attempts to joke about the accident , apparently trying to make some light of the subject while at the same time barely covering his mixture of anger at Trevor's catastrophic carelessness and shock at how quickly his body and his life were forever changed . Trevor , on the other hand , is tremendously upset at the accident , and becomes increasingly irrational and angry as time goes on , as he tries to figure out what happened . There is a man named Ivan who works with Trevor , and for a variety of reasons they get to know each other . Ivan once suffered an injury at the workplace and lost some fingers , which were then replaced with some of his toes , resulting in one of the most grotesque things you may ever have seen organically attached to a human hand . It is truly disgusting . Things start to get weird for Trevor when he discovers that he is the only person who knows of any Ivan that works there . The idea of a character getting to know someone and then discovering that that person doesn't really exist is nothing new , but here it prevents us from having any idea where the movie is going . I think it's safe to assume that a lot of what is happening is happening in Trevor's head , but more importantly , it is a fascinating trip through the moody blue atmosphere of Trevor's sleep-deprived mind . For a temporary escape from his lifeless life , he looks to Stevie , a prostitute who gives him much more than sex , she gives him an understanding that he can't seem to get anywhere else . Jennifer Jason Leigh is surprisingly effective in this role , and she is able to very clearly portray Stevie's understanding of Trevor , as well as the emergence of their mutual need that goes far beyond just being physical . If there are any slow points in the movie , they are easily glossed over by the interest generated by Trevor's deteriorating condition . Something terrible has happened to him in the past , or continues happening , and the movie shows us his own efforts to figure it out , put everything back in order , and finally get some sleep . The end of the movie will disappoint some viewers , but like so many other great films , it doesn't tie everything up in a nice little bow . It leaves you thinking , and demands a second viewing . Note : According to the IMDb trivia page for the movie , Scott Kosar wrote the screenplay for this movie right out of film school , which would mean that , when he wrote the script for the 2003 Texas Chainsaw remake the year before , he was still a student . This may provide some reason for why that movie was so astonishingly bad . Director Brad Anderson , on the other hand , also wrote and directed a brilliant horror film a few years ago called Session 9 , which I also highly recommend ?
544625	562732	330801	10.0	THIS is an Oscar worthy animated short !	Rocks is one of the best animated films I've ever seen . It not only starts off with a clever idea , but it alternates between real time and geologic time so simply but so effectively that it is almost like it is alternating between two different worlds . It gives a great idea of the difference between geologic time and the time that we experience , as two rock piles talk to each other , complaining about another ice age like it's a rainy day . The stop motion animation itself is indeed brilliant , but my favorite part is the picture that the movie paints about the path of human history . It shows us how fast we move in geologic time , illustrating the description of humans as a " flash in the pan " in the perspective of the history of the earth . Take any geology class , and one of the first things you will learn is that , if all 4 . 6 or so billion years of the earth's life were condensed into a 24 hour period , humans came into existence something like 2 seconds before midnight , and this movie knows that . The rocks are initially impressed with the development and industrialization that they see going on around them , the increase in productivity and efficiency , until suddenly it becomes a monster , growing and growing and towering over them , threatening their homes and their existence . But before anything serious happens to them , the growth that they witnessed begins to decay and break down , and they watch apathetically as it collapses back into the earth from which it grew , becoming the rolling hills that it always was . It is a very pessimistic view of the future of the human race , but more than likely true . What I really love about the film is that it can really make you look at the way you live your life without ever becoming preachy or , in a film that contains the end of humanity , political . This is truly a great film .
544595	562732	185906	10.0	Absolutely compelling .	One of my favorite episodes was number five , particularly the subway scene and the scene where the men are getting ready for the final advance and see the enormous line of soldiers falling back , having been ambushed and their numbers decimated . The subway scene is one of the best ones in the entire series that illustrates the connection between the battlefield and civilian life . Major Winters , played by Damian Lewis who later makes a huge left turn in his acting career , playing Jonesy in Stephen King's Dreamcatcher , reluctantly accepts a weekend pass to spend some time in Paris , and while on a subway train he looks around at the other passengers and each face brings him a flashback from the battlefield , one of which being the soldier that he runs into after coming over a hill and , while the man signals his helplessness , shoots dead with one shot ( okay , three shots , for effect ) . At first this might look a little cheesy , the hardened soldier getting his first look at relatively normal society after so long on the battlefield , but that is exactly what it was like for these guys ( NOTE : I have never been in battle and so have no basis for saying that last sentence ) . The thing that I liked was that he saw these people on the subway and was reminded of dramatic moments in battle involving people that looked like them . So yeah , I may never have been in battle or served any time in the military , but I love this connection between civilian life and the battlefield , because it is something that the audience of a war film often does not do until they leave the theater or turn off the film , and the effect is intensified when it is one of the actual characters in the film making that connection himself ( NOTE : I've seen tons of war films and so have plenty of basis for saying that last sentence ) . It is moments like this that really make you see the severity of what these guys went through . In the scene with the retreating soldiers , we see the ironically named Easy Company awaiting their orders to advance , with little ammunition , food , or winter clothing , and when they see this line of soldiers retreating it takes them several seconds before they think to start grabbing ammunition and rations off of these guys because of the shock of what they're seeing . I could hardly stand to see them let a single soldier walk by without taking his ammo and grenades and everything , but then again , these guys are faced with a whole line full of revelations that they're almost certainly about to walk to their deaths , so they were probably not thinking quite as clearly as I was . In casually perusing other reviews of Band of Brothers , I'm glad that not many people are simply comparing it to Saving Private Ryan , because even though Spielberg was the executive producer and Tom Hanks was a director , it is really not in the shadow of Saving Private Ryan . This is an outstanding rendering of the true stories of Easy Company during World War II , and I'm happy to see that so many people have recognized that . It's hard to follow up a movie like Saving Private Ryan that is about the same topic without being immediately compared to that movie , but since Band of Brothers has done it to a large extent , I think it's a testament to the quality of the miniseries itself . Band of Brothers has set all kinds of records for the small screen , and smartly avoids mostly all of the clichés that are seen in so many war films , even clichés of the great films like Private Ryan ( such as stereotypical characters that have stereotypical relationships with each other ) or of the bad ones , like Pearl Harbor ( such as the obligatory romances , the loved ones left behind , etc ) . Band of Brothers is a very straightforward and shockingly graphic and detailed description of the hardships that these men endured while performing their service to America , hardships which are only dulled and pushed aside by the greedy pulling of emotional heartstrings by Hollywood executives . Each episode opens with interviews with several of the actual men from Easy Company talking about some of the experiences that that episode deals with , and these interviews are fleshed out even more in a sixth DVD which should not be overlooked ! This is an outstanding achievement . Yes , it's roughly ten hours long , but that allows an even better opportunity to get to know the characters , and the episodes are designed so that you become connected to them as people , not as characters , and their experiences are presented in such starling detail and realism that it is virtually impossible not to be moved .

It's too bad that they don't make more period films , because of they did , Joseph Fiennes might find more work . Joseph Fiennes was probably asked to play William Shakespeare in Shakespeare in Love because of his excellent performance in Elizabeth , and he was only one among a great many actors who gave incredible performances in this spectacular historical drama , in which the 16th century is flawlessly created and presented . There are many things that make Elizabeth a great film . For example , not only is it amazingly realistic , but it also portrays a very accurate depiction of the Queen . The difficult early part of her reign is not as well known as the stunning success that she later achieved as a leader , and her potent and strong-willed personality is captured very well in this film . She suffers through countless hardships during this part of her life , and the circumstances leading to her crowning of herself as The Virgin Queen are what make up the story of this excellent film . The visuals , particularly the breathtaking interiors of the tremendous castles in which much of the film takes place , are some of the most amazing things about this movie . This is an epic drama crafted with amazing skill , excellent performances , and stunning photography . See it .
544838	562732	68646	10.0	Francis Ford Coppola takes a story written by Mario Puzo and makes it into one of the greatest films ever made .	Italian films have quite often come under some sort of controversy , in large part because of the fact that Italian immigrants have been given an undeserved reputation of being inherently violent and universally tied to some sort of organized crime . Mass media is one of the main reasons for this , which is why Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather instigated such fierce opposition and controversy when it was released in 1972 . Coppola has insisted that the film is not about Italians involved in organized crime , but that it is instead a metaphorical representation of the American government . Personally , I don't believe that at all , if only because no one is going to watch a film like that and overlook exactly what they see and make the connection between the film and the American government . However , this does not take away from the overall accomplishment that the film makes . The genius of The Godfather lies in Coppola's obvious directing skills , as well as author Mario Puzo's skill as a storyteller . The film tells the story of five tremendously powerful crime families that are at war with one another , but no one seems to be quite sure who committed the crimes that instigated the war , which makes for an interesting investigation as a subplot . Marlon Brando's performance as Don Vito Corleone is one of the best in history , and one of the major accomplishments of the film as a whole is that it is able to take this man , who is really a despicable person , and make him into an endearing character that we really care about . He is the leader of a crime family , but he is made into an antagonist . The film twists things around like that , which is one of the things that really makes it so watch-able . Aside from making Don Corleone into such a likeable character , he is also made to be tremendously respectable . Personally , I noticed this because I watched The Godfather again recently while going through and watching all of the James Bond films . Here is James Bond , who is supposed to be one of the most tasteful , refined , and high-class figures in action film , and Brando's Don Corleone effortlessly makes even Sean Connery's Bond look like a Spice Girl . The story of The Godfather is complex and involved enough to have taken up three very long films , and they are tied together brilliantly . This film ends with Vito Corleone's son Michael taking over his leadership position , in a scene that doesn't only leave room for a sequel , but demands one . The film ends with Michael Corleone in his father's office , being addressed by two of his father's assistants as Don Corleone , a title attributed only to his father until that point in the film . It would have been an unsatisfactory to end the film that way without continuing the story , and this was done two years later , with yet another Best Picture winner . The Godfather is a landmark in film history , because of the incredible story , the astronomical performances , the expert direction , and the picture perfect cinematography . The film is literally packed with memorable and famous scenes , and the performances from everyone involved are spectacular . Even at three hours , The Godfather never gets boring or slow . It is a stunningly intense ride from beginning to end .
