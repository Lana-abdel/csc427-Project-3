543794	562732	306047	1.0	An absolute disaster just like the first two .	Now , my bitter disappointment by this time in the ridiculous Scary Movie saga is no surprise , and I have no one to blame but myself for going to the theaters to see it in the first place , and the only weak excuse I have is that I heard from someone that it was much better than the first two ( really , could it possibly have been WORSE ? ? ) because it had a different director . So I figured that since it wasn't TOTALLY a production of the abysmal senses of humor of the Wayans brothers , I would give it a shot , and the only good thing that came of it was that I learned once and for all how important it is to consider a film's target audience before paying real money to sit in an entire theater full of them . So , that being said , if you're the kind of person that would really get a kick out of seeing an eight-year-old boy beaten repeatedly about the head , face , and body with a baseball bat , please , go see this movie . If it would really please you to see that same boy get hit by a car TWICE , you're sure to enjoy this idiotic mess of a film . If , on the other hand , you like to have the slightest speck of actual thought put into a film , you might want to avoid this one , or at least wait until it comes out of video so you don't have to surround yourself with the kinds of people who answered yes to the first two questions . Believe me , I surrounded myself with them a couple nights ago and wished the entire time that I had a pot to put over my head and a wooden spoon to hit it with . That would have been more enjoyable than the movie . When I write my IMDb reviews , I usually try to keep from getting too upset by how bad a movie is . After all , I'm the one that went to see it in the first place , right ? And I don't believe in that ' I want my money back ' crap . Nowhere at any movie theater in the world does it say at the ticket booth ' Satisfaction Guaranteed . ' When you buy a movie ticket , you spent the money whether you liked the movie or not , that's not a hard concept to figure out . I have no problem with a movie being offensive . Quite the contrary , offensive movies tend to be the ones that are most remembered because they made an impression , even if it might have been a relatively bad one . Movies that make you a little bit uncomfortable are the ones that you notice , the ones that make a lasting difference . And I'm not only talking about massively important examples like Schindler's List or American History X or anything like that . Consider this , if every single movie was happy and fun like something like Indianan Jones or Toy Story or Back to the Future , movies would be pointless , they would be little more than pretty things to look at and something to make us laugh and to entertain us for an hour and a half . But when a movie makes us uncomfortable or is offensive to our beliefs or our way of life , maybe just because it shows us something that we don't normally or have never seen and probably don't WANT to see ( like death ) , that's when they gain a new kind of power over us - the power to affect our view of the world . Unfortunately , obtaining this kind of constructive discomfort is not only difficult to capture , it is also VERY easy to screw up , especially when you , as the director / writer / etc , of the film clearly do not care about getting it right and / or do not understand the importance of getting it right . And this is not just true of dramatic war films or deadly serious films , it's also very true of the comedy and even the spoof comedy . The spoof comedy even more than the rest is expected to make fun of the movies that it spoofs and to do it RESPECTFULLY . Granted , some of the jokes in Scary Movie 3 are funny , some of the spoofs are done in relatively good taste ( although , compared to the rest of the material , that's not saying much ) , and some of them I laughed out loud at . But where the Scary Movies go seriously and unforgivably wrong is that they do not understand when they have gone too far , when they've crossed the line , when they've crossed from being childishly amusing to being seriously offensive . And not the good kind of offensive either . I'm not just talking about jokes that are too gross or boobs that are almost popping out or too much profanity , I'm talking about the fact that there WILL be people seeing this movie who have had a brother or a cousin or a SON who has been killed by getting hit by a careless driver , and these people will have walked into this movie having no idea that they are going to see this happen onscreen and have to suffer through an entire theater-full of morons laughing their idiot heads off . Scary Movie 2 featured a character with a disfigured arm , and everyone groaned and yelled and said ' Oh God gross ! ! ! ' when he ate mashed potatoes off his hand as though he were performing fellatio on it . Clearly , Mawn and Sharlon Wayans , or whatever their names are , have no idea that there are people like this in real life , who want to be able to go to the movies and have a good time just like everyone else . So like I said , I have no problem with movies being offensive . I encourage it . But it becomes a problem when the makers of the film have no idea about how the mechanics of offensive material work , and the Wayans brothers are clearly clueless . This is not something that's ' all in good fun , ' this is the absolute bottom of the scale of bad taste , stuff for which there is no place in mainstream entertainment . I hope that I've avoided offending anyone who enjoyed the movie by things I've said in this review . I support constructively offensive material in movie reviews just like I do in the movies , as I described above , and I do not try to offend anyone with what I say in my reviews . So that being said , honk if you love the Scary Movies . Then drive into a tree .
544393	562732	78935	1.0	Ruggero Deodato has truly achieved a milestone new level of depravity and meaningless violence ?	What you have in Cannibal Holocaust is a story about a group of people from NYU that go to document a culture of cannibals and never come back . Not that the story matters . Having watched I think three cannibal movies now ( this is three more than the average healthy adult's lifetime recommended dosage ) , it has become clear to me that they are nothing more than exhibitions of movie violence and sickness . And in that area , the movie succeeds brilliantly . It is so tasteless and so disgusting that it's amazing that things like this ever get made . And not just for the animal mutilations or the feces flinging ( yeah that really happens in this movie . It's not just a t-shirt for smartass teenagers ) or the orgies of misogynistic violence , but of course there are tons of naked natives in the movie , many of them obviously underage . But I guess that is just not a concern in whatever country the movie was distributed from . I am guessing we are meant to be impressed by the feeding scenes , since logic would lead you to believe that that is what a cannibal film centers on . If so , maybe that explains why all the natives must smear their food all over their faces before they eat it , although I am at a loss to explain why women are regularly mutilated , dismembered , fornicated with and THEN eaten . It becomes clear early on that surely someone in the group of NYU people must snap , unable to take what they're seeing anymore , and of course it does happen . One guy , since the natives ' distrust ' them ( maybe it was all that shooting ? ) decides to strip naked to " become like them . " Evidently this man has never seen the whiteness of his naked self before , but the island girls don't seem to mind . As soon as this awkward white guy strips off his khakis a whole group of naked girls run up to him and start grab-assing for a little while . Hey , maybe cannibals aren't so bad after all ? Oh , but minutes later , the group are forced to eat human , as is to be expected . The natives gleefully shove entrails in their faces as they inexplicably turn into savages for the purpose of this bizarre plot . Why the instant and total descent into barbarism ? I have no idea , the movie isn't intelligent enough to explain such a thing , all it knows how to do is show you something that you would be much better off never seeing . A giant turtle is torn apart alive with bare hands while the cameraman zooms in for an extreme close-up so as not to miss a single revolting detail , a monkey gets its face cut off , a backwoods amputation is cauterized with a hot machete and , when the poor amputee immediately dies , the rest of the crew forget seconds later , laughing and joking in the subsequent footage . This is , of course , all documentary footage that they're watching of a past film crew . It seems that these mental giants went into the village and started screaming and shooting their guns and burning the village , and then wondered why they were massacred . It is not exactly a massive intellectual surge when one of the new crew says " these people probably think WE'RE the savages ! " Yeah , what tipped you off ? The burning of their village or the fornicating in the ashes ? Clearly this is meant to be the movie's thinly disguised message . White people are savages at least as much as the people that we think of as savages . Oh and in case you didn't happen to catch that message when it smacked you in the head numerous times like a ton of bricks , at one point the " civilized " people grab one of the native girls and rape her , trying to show her the errors of her ways . Clever . These people are nothing like any manner of civilized people , they are absolute degenerates and should be imprisoned . They even shout for joy when they find a woman impaled on a pole . What the hell is this garbage ? But in watching a movie like this , it seems to me that it is the people that would make and distribute something like this that are the savages . At least horror movies are FUN , even bad ones . And this is not a bad horror movie . It's not a horror movie at all , I don't know what you would call it , but it is truly horrible . A mother gives birth to an infant in the movie , for example . The baby is taken away from it's mother , drenched in blood and then buried in the mud while the mother is beaten to death with rocks . There is a point in the movie where the utterly talentless writer , evidently unaware of how breathtakingly obvious his story is , has one of his characters spoon-feed you the real meaning of the movie : " Today people want sensationalism . The more you rape their senses , the happier they are . " This sentence betrays a staggering lack of understanding of film-going audiences , but at least it is a flawless description of the thought behind the movie . Too bad you have to watch it to learn that you should never have watched it ?
543882	562732	257106	1.0	I normally reserve my votes of for those extremely few films that are absolutely incomprehensible . I made an exception for this disaster .	Doesn't it seem like just days ago that we were flogged with the FIRST Scary Movie ? What a pile of crap this movie was . There's just no other way to describe it . I hated the original , for obvious reasons , so I was shocked that this ridiculous sequel managed to sneak beneath the abysmal level to which the original sank less than a year ago . The Wayans brothers have returned to the spotlight to remind the world of their immaturity , their sickening sense of humor , and their absolute lack of any type of film-making talent . This is drivel of the lowest order and is completely devoid of redeeming values of any kind . On the other hand , there is a place for a film like this , even among educated people . For example , if you are a professional film critic , or even an average movie-goer who writes reviews for the IMDb ( a group of people with whom I proudly associate ) , then a movie like Scary Movie 2 is worth watching just because it is so much fun to shoot it down afterwards in a review . There's something morbidly satisfying about watching a dumbass movie like this and then tearing it up in a review , even if you already know that not too many people will bother to read it . I can't even begin to satisfactorily convey to you the absolute idiocy of this film , I can only say that there is a total absence of any kind of talent or thought behind it , and it results as nothing more than an hour and a half of blabbering nonsense . Did you ever wonder how many perfectly good careers are ended , some even before they've really began , by hideous movies like this ? Tori Spelling's flailing and altogether unenviable career is officially over , Tim Curry is too good an actor to be completely destroyed by movie like this , but this was clearly his version of Travolta starring Battlefield Earth . There can be no doubt about Anna Faris's talent as an actress , and she's beautiful , too , but she'll never be able to overcome the awful reputation that she has established for herself in the Scary Movies . Marlon and Shawn Wayans are the lucky ones here , because neither had anything to lose when they took on these crapfests . This kind of movie is a metaphorical handgun with which various actors can voluntarily commit career suicide . For shame . And one more thing , if any of the people behind the Scary Movies are reading this , I'd like to ask a huge favor for the greater good of mankind - " FOR GOD'S SAKE , NO MORE ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! "
544504	562732	1073498	1.0	I have not seen this movie .	If you look through my reviews , you'll notice that I've reviewed three Scary Movies , along with Epic Movie ( with which this movie deservedly shares a spot on the IMDb Bottom 100 ) not long ago , and in most of them I berate myself for being stupid enough to waste my time watching them . This is the first time I've ever written a review of a movie I haven't seen , and I do it only because I've thrown away so many hours watching the ridiculous tripe that these idiots continue to defecate into theaters . In this case , thankfully , the trailer alone was enough to show me that it was going to be more of the idiotic , nonsensical garbage we have come to expect from Friedberg and Seltzer . I'm willing to bet that their parents tell people that they haven't heard from their kids in years and don't know what they are up to because they don't know how to get a hold of them . Aren't they making those movies , though ? No , no , no , no , no , that's not my son . Definitely not . My son is , ah , anyone else . Have you seen those yellow warning signs that say " Caution : This is Sparta " ? THAT is funny . You don't even have to watch it to know that this movie is not . There are a lot of times when you can ignore the nay-sayers and watch a badly reviewed movie anyway and make up your own mind . This is not one of those times . No stars .
544799	562732	988849	2.0	# 1 Movie To Avoid This Week ( . . . and every week ) . . .	Holy crap . It's not often that a movie comes along that is so morally vacuous that it approaches a level of violent stupidity so intricately bad that it is absolutely not enjoyable on any level . But when it does happen , and it has happened with this movie , it makes my job seem incredibly difficult because I have to sit here and try to write a professional film review when I know without a shadow of a doubt that three simple words would suffice - DON'T WATCH IT . But if you would like to know why , please continue reading . First of all , let's brainstorm about what makes a violent thriller entertaining , shall we ? You need to have an engaging story , something that moves at a brisk pace and maintains interest without relying on the violence to push it along . You need to have not only believable characters but characters that we care enough about to invest our emotions in their well - being , and you need to have a catalyst operating beneath the surface that drives the characters on screen to commit whatever violent acts take place in the movie . Donkey Punch has none of these . Not even a little bit . There is , of course , a lot to be said about violence in the movies . Some say there's too much , some say movies are movies and no movie violence is going to change who people are or entice people to commit violent acts , and some people are just violent movie-hounds and can never get enough . Whatever your personal opinion , I tend to think that we can all agree that at the very least , movie violence should have a point , right ? Not this movie . Donkey Punch gives us a film populated with morons , perverts , rapists and idiot college girls , not a single character worth a scrap of thought or interest , and then asks us to care when they start killing each other off . A group of college-girls meet a group of college-age guys at a European resort and , hungry for some adventure stories to take home from their European vacation , immediately accept a shady offer to come touring the Mediterranean Sea on a luxurious yacht to which one of them happens to have access . Anyone with two brain cells working at the same time would have hesitated for at least a few seconds before accepting such an offer from a bunch of crusty guys like these , but no matter . If nothing else , the immediacy of the acceptance will pretty quickly and thoroughly paint the picture of what the rest of the movie is going to be like . Everyone wants to have sex with everyone else , and while taking turns with the blonde not far into the movie in a drug-crazed orgy , when one guy convinces another guy to try out a little sex move called the " donkey punch . " I won't waste your time explaining what it is . It doesn't matter , it's just a plot device needed to supply the cast with a dead body so that they can spend the rest of the movie killing each other off as they struggle to figure out who can be trusted and who should just be killed . There is not a scrap of realism in the movie , not an iota of clever dialogue or impressive acting , and the by-the-numbers ending does nothing to boost the mood of genuine depression that permeates the entire movie . This thing is a waste in pretty much every way imaginable . Avoid it .
544906	562732	1198138	2.0	f .	Remember that movie Wild Wild West ? Will Smith has said that that movie is one of his biggest regrets , because it opened at # 1 even though it sucked , and he said he hated knowing that so many people were spending their money to watch a movie that wasn't good . At the time I'm writing this , Obsessed is the # 1 movie in the American box office , and I'm wondering if , for example , Beyonce feels as guilty as Will Smith did , because Wild Wild West is about ten times better than this snoozefest . Personally I doubt she has the acting chops to even realize how god-awful this thing is . I've seen some backwards thrillers in my time but THIS ? I care hardly think of where to start . My first question is for Beyonce . I'm wondering if , when she signed on to play the wife of a man stalked by a psychotic blonde , if she knew that her character would ultimately turn out to be just as psychotic as the psychotic one . I'm guessing yes , because here's a direct quote from her character late in the movie ? " You think you're crazy ? I'll show you crazy ! " Wow . If you want to watch Ali Larter squeezing her limited talents into the form of a badly written blonde with some relationship issues and Beyonce talking all tough to her ( and to her husband ) , you might enjoy this movie . Every once in a while a movie comes along that is so flawlessly terrible that the perfection of the way the badness fits together becomes a fascinating area of study . This is one of those times . Sharon is married to Derek who has a new employee at his work , a crazy hot blonde named Lisa who was recently hired on from a temp agency . She falls in love with Derek and forms a fantasy in her head that she and Derek are together , blah blah blah blah . The movie is called Obsessed and stars two women and one man . You don't really need to know anything else in order to know everything there is to know about the movie , except how bad it is . Sadly , you have to watch it to find that out . One of my favorite things was that the movie is as suspenseless as any movie I've ever seen , and yet the suspense music kicks up constantly and I guess we're supposed to scoot forward to the edge of our seats and get all worried and whatnot . There's a scene when Lisa e-mails a picture of herself to Derek which opens itself in a dozen windows as soon as he opens the e-mail , and the orchestra kicks in frantically as Derek slowly clicks them each closed , his wife only seconds away . Did anyone else laugh at this ? First of all , why would you slowly click them closed one by one ? Does he know nothing about computers ? ALT-F4 , man ! ! Or if it's a Mac , Command-W ! ! But of course , if he knew how to close windows like that then we would have missed out on the sheer tension of watching this guy about to suffer the wrath of Beyonce . They actually tried to generate TENSION by having a guy struggling to close windows on his computer before his wife sees it ! ! HAHAHAHAHAHAAA ! ! ! Then again , with a wife as horrific as Beyonce's character , maybe it's a good idea to fear her hysterical wrath . She does , after all , kick him out of HIS OWN HOUSE for three months because she thinks . Not KNOWS , mind you . She SUSPECTS that he had an affair . And when I say his own house , I mean the beautiful , multi-million dollar mansion that they live in , with the sleek new Escalade parked out front . This woman , ladies and gentlemen , is a COLLEGE STUDENT . I have trouble relating to a man who would suffer so much ridiculous punishment at the hands of an insecure and violently suspicious woman , and still beg on his hands an knees for her to take him back . In order for a movie like this to work , you have to care about the characters , that's obvious , but it's impossible here . Obsessed has nothing going for it . It's a movie about one poor guy with two psychotic women around him and I'm going to go ahead and suggest that it's just not possible to make a good movie when your basic premise is so overflowing with the yawn-inducing clichés of cheap , no-rent thrillers . It is informative that Obsessed comes from David Loughery , the same screenwriter who gave us the highly disappointing thriller Lakeview Terrace last year . Obsessed is pretty much exactly the same story , except Lakeview Terrace was about a black neighbor angry at his interracial neighbors . Now we have a black wife going crazy at her black husband's white stalker . Set your watch to beep every ten minutes or so to make sure you can stay awake . It was a struggle for me ! Even worse , I'm not sure who the target is . Angry black women who hate skinny , smart-ass blondes ? Maybe . Word has it that the original title was " Oh No She Didn't , " which would at least have been amusing and advertised right away that the whole movie is a joke . If they had made this a parody , I really think it could have been good , but it takes itself super - seriously , even when challenging us not to laugh at Beyonce flinging Ali Larter all over her house , or not to cringe when she viciously berates her boyfriend , for whom she has not the wispiest scrap of trust but who has committed no crime . The most effective thing that the movie does is convince me beyond a shadow of a doubt that if I ever find myself dating Beyonce I will throw myself in front of the nearest train .
543867	562732	448965	2.0	Wow , this is incredibly bad .	Knowing that several of the actors in this movie have turned in remarkable roles in other films and television shows , I have come to suspect that the massive performance deficiencies displayed in this film are the result of what appears to be nonexistent direction . When I look at the performances given here , I can only picture director Russell Mulcahy standing behind the camera giving the same direction that Bob MacKenzie ( Rick Moranis ) was given by his brother Doug in Strange Brew ( " PSST ! ! Act ! Act ! ! " ) . I am familiar with a good portion of the work of Jules Verne , as well as the astonishing and disappointing creative liberties that are so often taken with his work ( it still blows my mind completely that they added a DUCK to the 1959 adaptation of Journey to the Center of the Earth ) , but I have not read Mysterious Island so I don't know how faithful the film is to the original story . In any case , there is not a single passable performance in the movie , the direction is completely witless , and the special effects are deplorable . A 15-year-old with an outdated copy of After Effects could do better than this . Besides all that , I will be perfectly happy to live out the rest of my life and never again see a movie in which someone washes up onto a beach , sleeping soundly , and then coughs once or twice before getting up to go exploring . Are the giant insects not enough reason for suspension of disbelief ? And don't even get me started on the pirates , my god what a joke . First of all , not only do our heroes react with hostility and violence when they finally encounter other normal human beings of the non - gigantic - man - eating - insect variety on the island , but after inviting them over to their humble Robinson Crusoe home , complete with dinner table , place settings for ten , goblets , eating utensils , candles , and the like , but once convinced of the defected pirates ' trustworthiness , they give one of them - a caveman looking sort from years surviving on the island ? a total celebrity makeover , shave , haircut , gel , new clothes , etc . I guess they forgot that they are surviving , too . The worst thing that the movie does , besides the deplorable performances and ridiculous screenplay ( I can even forgive awful direction as long as the effort is there ) , is that it tries to create dramatic and intense situations when there is no reason for it . The captain jumps maybe 15 feet into the water to lighten the load on the hot air balloon , and everyone freaks out as though he jumped out of a plane . Other humans are greeted with suspicion as though anyone has any reason to be afraid for their lives . At one point , the eagle-eyed Neb , played by Omar Gooding , uses a telescope to spot a massive , four-masted pirate ship maybe a hundred yards off shore . He calls to the captain and explains that he has spotted a pirate ship and hands him the telescope , somehow intuitively knowing that the captain will not be able to see Old Ironsides blotting out the horizon without it . I'll go right ahead and admit that I had extremely low expectations for the show , it's made-for-TV , first of all , and I've yet to see a single competently made Jules Verne film adaptation , but I've seen better acting in an elementary school drama class , and the script could not possibly be dumber . Who thought it would be a good idea to have the good guys sneak up on the pirate ship behind a floating log , for God's sake ? ? Come on guys , let's just swim right out to the ship , no one will notice ! Wow . Miss this one .
544567	562732	295700	2.0	Yes , that's exactly right . VERY wrong turn .	I am referring , of course , to the script , not necessarily to any choices the characters on screen made , although it would apply in that case as well . Wrong Turn is the latest in the ongoing stream of abysmal teen horror films cranked out by Hollywood since the mid-90s or so . The odd thing is that they chose to focus their plot this time around a man studying to be a doctor , as if there's a single solitary person in their target audience who could relate to this person . Anyone who knew anything about medicine would have a field day with the ridiculously exaggerated rednecks in this movie . Okay , so I realize that we live in the times of massive special effects and the wonders of Stan Winston and other things that lead to the Hulk being cartoonishly exaggerated to the point that the highly anticipated Hulk remake is rendered a camp comedy , but it's not hard to see how much better Wrong Turn could have been if only they had made the villains at least the TINIEST bit believable . It was rather disturbing for me to read through some of the reviews and posts on the IMDb and see how many people out there were considering what it would take for someone to be inbred to the point where they would look like the people in this movie . ' Are there really people like that ? ' And other such nonsense . Let me tell you what it would take for people to get like that - about five hours of make-up every morning before shooting . Take a movie like Deliverance . Granted , Wrong Turn never had a chance in the world to even approach the quality of a serious thriller , even one far below the status of Deliverance . But the point is that the suspense in Deliverance FAR surpassed anything that Wrong Turn ever even gets close to , because the mountain men in Deliverance were just a lot of backwards rednecks , they weren't monsters as they were in this movie . Deliverance went for scares through avenues of twisted , demented people , mysterious and dark woods , and the knowledge of impending violence in a mysterious setting . Wrong Turn takes the wrong turn of going for nothing more than the weak gross-outs . When Chris Finn finds himself in a rush and faced with a tremendous traffic jam , he turns around and decides to pull off and ask a gas station attendant if there's another way . The gas station attendant , by the way , provided some promise for the rest of the film , as he sits in front of rust pile of a gas station drinking Pepto Bismol with his three teeth and staring into the dust . There ARE people like THIS in the world . But here is the point where the movie does take its wrong turn . Finn decides to take a route that he notices on a map on the wall , and as he drives off , we get a close-up of this charming businessman muttering under his breath about the mistake that he was making . Because he's entering the badlands , as Stephen King might say . This is when the thriller halts and the goofy horror begins . The guy might as well have said something like , ' That ain't no good ah-dear , cityboy . We MOUN-tain foke . We ain't liven out here by yall's RULES and all . ' I sigh resignedly as my eyes glaze over for the rest of the film . What follows is the typical jigsaw puzzle of a modern horror film . Everything works JUST right for two people and completely wrong for everyone else . Finn slows to about 5mph to look at a dead deer on the side of the dirt road that he's decided to take around the traffic , and within the of one second between that shot and the next shot , he has sped up to about 50 , fast enough to slam into a big SUV parked right in the middle of the road , completely destroying both vehicles . Sigh . Anyway , the remarkably polite owners of the vehicle , obviously aware that cars could come FLYING THROUGH this particular section of this particular dirt road , are out of the car and in the underbrush , pondering the mystery of the spike strip that they just ran over . So there you have it . A lot of people ( two couples , one single girl and now , one single guy ) are in the middle of the woods with no phone , no idea where they are , and no idea that there are creations of Stan Winston waiting in the woods to devour them . Speaking of which , let's consider those creations , as they can be described in no other way . What you have are a lot of examples of evolution in reverse . Sure , inbreeding can do some serious damage to both the phenotype and the genotype of anyone odd enough to mate with their family , but generations upon generations of such inbreeding would create nothing even remotely like what you see here . But whatever , this is a horror movie and it's all in fun . The reason I point out these monsters is that their cartoonishly exaggerated nepotism ( I'm only about 60 % sure that's the right word , by the way , but you get the point ) prevented the movie from ever generating any real suspense , although there are plenty of scenes that will challenge your ability to finish your popcorn . It's too bad that they screwed these guys up so badly , because while the movie was going to be pretty bad from the outset , it could have at least been suspenseful . At any rate , my favorite of the monsters in this movie was the little guy , I don't know what his name was but he looked like a question mark with skin . That's some serious inbreeding . I won't go into the various forehead slapping scenes ( although I'd love to ) , but I really liked how the movie stops in its tracks long enough to shove the impending romance down our throats , as if there was a split second since all the characters were introduced that we didn't already know it was coming . And when I say the movie stopped in its tracks , I mean it very literally . Finn and Jessie , the obligatory love interest , pause under a WATERFALL long enough for her to forget that there are mutants chasing them and tell him about how she and her boyfriend broke up . This is ham-handed screenwriting at it's best . Or worst . Whichever is dumber . ( spoilers ) The rest of the movie , like all that which preceded this ludicrous scene , is an exercise in bringing about the very ending that you knew was coming all along the way . I will admit that there were some death scenes in the movie that were pretty creative ( I was going to say pretty GOOD , but that's hardly the right word to describe a depiction of a girl getting beheaded against a tree with an axe through her mouth ) , although such things are hardly enough to carry the entire film , which has little else to carry it .
544423	562732	119345	2.0	Another in a long line of inexplicably successful teen slasher movies that would fall flat if people would realize what they were watching .	I have to admit that I enjoyed this movie when I first saw it . I got a lot of good thrills out of it and basically just had a good time . However , when I watched it on video , the larger than life quality was entirely removed and I noticed a lot of things that hadn't occurred to me when I saw it in the theater . The acting , for example , was absolutely awful from everyone involved except for Anne Heche in the few scenes that she was in . And what is the big deal about Jennifer Love Hewitt ? ! She may be moderately attractive but she is one of the worst actresses I've ever seen , and I've seen some horrible acting ( see " Nightmare Weekend " ) . Sarah Michelle Gellar is totally unconvincing and Ryan Phillippe delivers the worst performance of his career . And don't even get me started on Freddie Prinze Jr . His eyebrows say it all every time . Besides that , the story , although theoretically possible , was terribly presented . A bunch of teenagers are partying and driving out in the hills late at night , they accidentally hit a man and , thinking he's dead , dump his body into a river to avoid having their lives needlessly ruined . Did anybody notice that just before the man in question had a little underwater tug-of-war with Barry ( Ryan Phillippe ) for Helen's ( Sarah Michelle Gellar ) princess crown , the man opened his eyes and Barry actually screamed in terror ? Given that , I hope I wasn't the only one laughing every time these morons speculated that " maybe he wasn't really dead . . . " HE GRABBED THE CROWN , HELD IT FIRMLY WHILE IT WAS WRENCHED FROM HIS FINGERS , AND OPENED HIS EYES , YOU IDIOTS ! ! ! How could they have been so stupid ? Of COURSE he wasn't dead . Besides that , why did he torment these poor kids ? They did him a favor ! Because of ' what they did last summer , ' he is now able to perform superhuman acts . Not only can he survive tremendous bodily harm ( in true Michael Myers form ) , but he can also perform menial tasks like loading and unloading a trunk full of crabs ( dead human body optional ) in a matter of seconds , and that includes flawless cleaning ! Think of the market value of a skill like that ! If I were him , I wouldn't be trying to kill anyone , I'd be getting rich ! He can also move with superhuman speed , the lucky guy . Oh wait , you gotta hear about another of my favorite parts . Just after the accident , Barry suggests that they dump the body because it won't do any good for them all to take the fall . Julie then reciprocates by saying that if there is some of the man on the car , then there's some of the car on him and when he's found the police will be able to find out whose car it was . How's that again ? They can do that ? I know that BMWs are nice cars . My uncle owns one , it's an amazing machine . But do they cover those cars with paint which can be used to identify each individual car ? Is that what they are suggesting in this scene ? Or are they just quickly establishing Julie James as a complete moron as early in the film as possible ? She sure was dumb in her cutesy love scene with Ray ( Freddie Prinze Jr . ) at the closing of the film . I never thought I'd say this , but this movie had a love story that was even more clumsily thrown in than your average Jerry Bruckheimer film ( even more than the ridiculous Coyote Ugly , which made an entire film out of one of these goofy romance flops ) . " I wanted you back , Julie . I couldn't lose you again . " " I feel your pain , Ray . " SHUT UP ! ! BOTH OF YOU ! ! I have never seen worse cheese than that in all my life . And yes , she really did say " I feel your pain . " As is obviously the case , I was ultimately not at all impressed by this movie . I liked it when I was in high school and didn't know any better , but now that my head in on straight , I can see that it is clearly a pathetic attempt to cash in on the seemingly endless stream of teen " scream " movies with which the unsuspecting public was bombarded in the late 1990s . If you liked Scream , good for you . It was a good movie . If you want more , stay away from I Know What You Did Last Summer ( as well as its equally awful sequel , I Still Know What You Did Two Summers Ago ) , and also try to avoid the mediocre Scream sequels . Watch something that is at least moderately entertaining , like Urban Legend ( I said entertaining , not original ) or The Blair Witch Project . I Know What you Did Last Summer is an honest attempt , but it is also a dismal failure .
543995	562732	431153	3.0	If you can't say anything nice , write a lot of books about it .	I'll tell you my problem with Ann Coulter . It's not so much that she disagrees politically with me or even that she condemns so many things that I believe in or just the way I see the world , it is that she cannot disagree with people like me in a civil way . So much of her platform is about how liberals are so childish and can't disagree with people on the right without reducing their argument to some goofy religious nonsense , they can't be friends with people on the right , they can't over look their differences with people on the right and just act like adults . Has she read any of her own books ? People like Susan Estrich and especially Bill Maher appear in this documentary to talk about how great Ann Coulter is because she has different views than they do but they are still friends with her . Interesting , because while this does speak highly of Estrich and Maher , the liberals in the situation , incidentally , the rest of the film is composed of footage of Coulter spouting hatred and prejudicial nonsense about liberals as though they were all copies of the same person . Odd that she would accuse liberals of being intolerant and childish , and then so incontestably describe herself through interviews and speeches as being exactly that herself . The amount of prejudice and blanket observations made about liberals is an interesting illustration of Coulter's massive hypocrisy , which might be rivaled only by that of her colleague , Rush Limbaugh , who has for years yammered on about how we need to clean up our streets , throw drug addicts in prison and throw away the key and whatnot . In her defense , at least she stays somewhat away from the naked , unapologetic racism of people like Michael Savage . Somewhat . I will say this in favor of Ann Coulter , she certainly knows what she believes and she will not alter her beliefs for anyone or for any reason . I actually do respect that a lot , because I have definitely been put off by the flip flopping that I have seen in politicians on both sides . Coulter doesn't however , plan on ever running for office , and thank god . That would be like Michael Moore running for elected office , an equally frightening prospect . Maybe I can put my thoughts in perspective in this way . Michael Moore is a left wing lunatic , and Ann Coulter is a right wing lunatic . They are essentially playing the same role on different teams . But I'll tell you the difference between them , and it's an important one . Michael Moore finds corruptions and lies and hypocrisies and other problems among Republicans , and he blows them wildly out of proportion and takes them out of context in order to further his own agenda . Ann Coulter , on the other hand , INVENTS lies and hypocrisies and other problems among Democrats and liberals , and blows them wildly out of proportion and takes them out of context to further her own agenda . Now , that's kind of a loose statement when I say further her agenda , because her agenda is really nothing more than getting attention . She is a shock jock exactly like Howard Stern , who openly admits that she comes up with the most shocking thing she can think of and then pushes the envelope even further . What validates her , frighteningly enough , is that she really believes all of this stuff she says , which she just admitted is the most extreme thing she can come up with . The problem is that she structures her arguments in a way that is impossible to take seriously on any intellectual level . Her arguments all too often take the form of stupid jokes aimed at getting a laugh and cheap approval from her audience , who just want to hear someone say something mean about the other side into a microphone . " Some illegal aliens were detained after September 11 . Some were detained so long they had to drop out of flight school altogether . " This quote comments on her utter disdain of illegal aliens in a pretty disturbing way , because she is showing her contempt for them as human beings , not as illegal citizens . She disregards them as though they don't exist because they don't have passports , and then gets a good laugh by suggesting that all illegal aliens are terrorists . And the laugh that she gets in response speaks volumes about her fans . It's really sad that Coulter is so over-flowing with hatred , it's kind of depressing to see someone like her pretend that she enjoys her criticism , because if you watch her reactions as she is faced with fans who ask her to sign their TRAITOR t-shirts or their copy of Mein Kampf , it becomes increasingly clear that she doesn't enjoy it . I guess because my views are so different , on some deep level I find it hilarious that she tries so hard to pass it off like she enjoys and is even amused by the negative reactions that she generates . It is truly pathetic , why say something like that in the same documentary that so clearly shows otherwise ? At any rate , my biggest problem with her is that she makes that idiotic claim that so many on both sides have made , " so-and-so hates America . " And it's not even just Michael Moore , it's LIBERALS . She literally states that half of America hates America . This might be the dumbest political statement ever made . Note : Coulter signs a liberal college student's t-shirt with the charming phrase " Have fun in Guantanamo . " A STUDENT . Ann Coulter doesn't hate America . She hates Americans .
544149	562732	74084	3.0	" Communism is a disease . It can destroy the world ! "	Powerful words for me to hear , having bought and watched this movie here in China . . . It is unusually interesting to read the reviews of professional film critics about Bernardo Bertolucci's wildly ambitious " 1900 , " which in my opinion stumbles in no small part because it resembles too much some of Bertolucci's other films , notably of the bizarre European sex drama variety . I have a secret theory that any legitimate film that portrays graphic sexual acts has sort of a glass ceiling , a level of quality that it can't surpass , no matter how spectacular the rest of the film is . That , like the graphic pig-slaughtering scene , is simply bad taste . 1900 is no exception , and the saddest thing is that the rest of the film is not even very good , it's just really long . In fact , at just over five hours , it's one of the longest films I've ever seen , second only to Stephen King's 6-hour The Stand , which was made for TV anyway . In all of the professional reviews I've read , I've noticed some unusually interesting examinations of what went wrong with Bertolucci's much anticipated epic film , and yet not one of them seems to have the nerve to come out and say what is so obviously the problem . And unfortunately , the horrendously bad taste doesn't end at the literally pornographic nudity . I can't think of any legitimate reason why we should have to watch a pig being butchered and then sliced in half , or ( and this one truly blew my mind ) see a man massage a horse's anus with his bare hands and then gleefully catch the steaming excrement in his hands . And to make matters worse , Bertolucci , in one of the short documentaries on the DVD re-release of the film , made the shocking claim that " I thought it was very innocent at the time . " It could very easily be said that he had no grip on reality when he made the film . Much of it is truly sickening . And the characterization is no different . Donald Sutherland is one of my favorite actors , and Bertolucci managed to coax a ridiculously cartoonish and offensive performance out of him . He is , of course , a Fascist blackshirt ( a bad guy ) , and we are most certainly not allowed to forget that . He has frightening , devilishly toothy grin , a cold , killers stare , and he wears a skull and crossbones on his shirt . He also , by the way , wantonly kills kittens and children . I only wish I could say that I was just being dramatic when I say that . . . The film tells the story of an era , not of its main characters , but it tells that story through the lives of the characters . DeNiro plays Alfredo Berlighieri , the son of a wealthy landowner , and best friend of Olmo Dalco ( Gerard Depardieu ) , a the son of a peasant who works for Alfredo's father . The scenes of their childhood are alternately fascinating and revolting , as we learn of their friendship despite their different backgrounds and yet are forced to sit through scenes of them as 12 or 13 year old boys examining and comparing their penises . There is no need for something like this in any film in any country at any time . Ever . From here on , respectable members of the audience may find it difficult to forgive this perverse nonsense and objectively enjoy the rest of the film . I also love the weakness of the characterization in the film . There is a scene early in the film where Olmo's father gives him a rousing speech about going off to join the military and maybe even learn to obey and take a wife but never forget that he comes from peasants , and just to make sure everyone in the audience has figured out that this is not a family of nobility , Olmo walks his dirty bare feet across a lengthy and crowded dinner table as his father gives him the speech . No one seems to mind . From a technical standpoint the film is a total , belligerent disaster . Everything is dubbed over , so no one's voice matches their facial movements , which are in turn exaggerated by the actors so they can try to more easily match up the dialogue later . It rarely ever works , and so their voices and the ambient sound is totally off from beginning to end . The photography , on the other hand , is brilliant , but as Ebert suggested , it comes across almost like an apology for the narrative mess of the rest of the film . Most interesting is that Bertolucci managed to make such an incompetent film with such stupendously talented actors as Gerard Depardieu , Robert DeNiro , and Donald Sutherland . Sutherland's character is so cartoonish that it's nearly impossible to take anything about his performance seriously , but DeNiro and Depardieu are both outstanding in their roles , which are mirror images of each other in more ways than one . Unfortunately , as becomes completely obvious in the film's closing scene , Bertolucci just had no idea what to do with them . 1900 is not a complete failure , but it is as close as I've ever seen a film this big come to being one . It is not a successful or even a respectable effort , but it is definitely an ARDUOUS effort , kind of like sitting through the whole movie . . .
544037	562732	890870	3.0	Yes , they're still making them .	Saw 4 opens with John , the Jigsaw killer , dead on a coroner's worktable . As soon as the movie started , I saw a man about to perform an autopsy on the first movie , hoping that somewhere within its lifeless corpse he might find something , anything , with which to fill up another movie . And can you guess it ? He found it . Apparently John swallowed one of those little tapes sometime during part 3 , and the games , unfortunately for us , are not quite over . Maybe he owed the producers a favor . Saw 3 had no reason for being made , so we know that the series is as dead as a doornail by now , so unfortunately I have to say that anyone who sits through this thing can't really complain . Yes , the movie is pathetically bad , but you can hardly feel tricked . Personally , I was just curious to see how they would continue a series that is now so clearly being done only for the profit . There is still the same tired formula of this guy putting people in horrendous situations to punish them for certain moral crimes , generally for not " appreciating their lives . " It was easier to overlook the ridiculous irony inherent in that premise during the first two movies , which were original and fresh , if a little disturbing , but now we are two movies later , the guy is dead , and still there is nothing new . I don't expect to see something new and innovative in every single movie I ever see , but anytime someone makes a good movie , if they make threes sequels they had better be doing something new , and Saw 4 definitely is not . The first big torture scenario involves two men chained together . One man's eyes are sewn shut , the other man's mouth is sewn shut . The man who can see notices that in the middle of their chain is a machine which will slowly reel them in , ultimately tightening the chain and , I suppose , beheading them . He can also see that there is a key attached to the back of the other guy's neck , which he knows without being told will open the padlock around his own neck . He must have seen the previous movies . Immediately , they start fighting with each other with various metal implements lying around . Why do they start fighting ? I don't know , maybe they're evil by nature and respond to confusion with violence . It's their undoing though , all they had to do was twist their chains and the machine would have snapped it like thread . Then again , this would not have resulted in enough footage of two guys doing horrible things to each other , and the producers would have been unsatisfied . Are you catching on to who the real sadists are here ? Soon we see Karen , whose ribs were torn off in part 3 . It's a terrible sight to see her hanging there with all of her organs exposed , and I am frightened to consider the fate of the soul of the person who came up with that idea . Granted , all she had to do was pour out the acid and take the key out of the bottom of the beaker with minimal acid burns . Maybe she was too scared to think straight . Then again , I would have been more concerned about how the machine was attached to my ribs than how to get the key , which was a pretty simple riddle if I've ever seen one . I'll admit that I had no problem watching the fat guy in part 4 get his eyes put out and then get quartered . If anything new is done in part 4 , it's that it has one guy getting punished for a crime for which he deserves brutal punishment . He violently raped however many women and collected the bloody pictures of them . I didn't catch whether or not he killed them , but it doesn't matter . Seeing someone deserve their punishment was a unique experience in the Saw movies . Then again , later we see an abused wife tied together with four foot rods pierced through their bodies , holding them together . Punishing an abusive husband AND his wife ? Come on . All the wife has to do is pulls out the rods , which will leave her relatively unharmed but which are piercing crucial arteries and organs in her husband's body . Yes , abused wives often have a terribly hard time leaving abusive husbands . Making it this painful is not going to make it any easier . Maybe it's a message to abused wives in the audience , but I doubt there are many . The biggest problem with the movie is that at the end , instead of giving us a good twist like the first two movies did , the story folds back on itself and , in the space of about three seconds , the timeline of the story completely unravels and makes no sense whatsoever . You will be thoroughly confused by the time the end credits start , but the upshot is that you won't care , at least it's over ?
544611	562732	77945	4.0	There's snakes out there this big ? ?	Mountain of the Cannibal God immediately strikes me as almost exactly the same thing as Last Cannibal World with a slightly bigger budget . It seems that the cannibal sub-genre is pretty limited as far as what kinds of things you can do with the story , so I kept my expectations low . Ursula Andress stars as the grieving wife of a man lost in the mysterious jungle , and she is determined to go in after him , although her intentions aren't exactly what they seem to be . I love it when they first enter the jungle , one of the guys says " Don't say a word to anyone , we don't want the police on our tail ! " Yeah , if you're ever going into a cannibal-infested jungle , make sure not to tell anyone where you're going . It would be awful if anyone were able to find you ! The tribe we meet in this installment is the same as the last cannibals , although their animal-like qualities are not quite as blown out of proportion . They are highly barbaric and undeveloped , of course , but this time instead of being too animal-like , they have a genuinely bizarre religion , although ancient religions are not always known for their conduciveness to modern logic . At one point they make a sacrifice for having killed a tarantula , but even more bizarre , when it is revealed that they have turned Susan's ( Andress ) husband into a god by pinning his rotting corpse on some kind of rack , it seems that one of the ways that they worship him is to wipe the pus and mucus from his decaying face and rub it on their own face . Nice . Stacey Keach also shows up in an early role long before his outstanding work in American History X , although he isn't given anything memorable to do here . He eventually reveals that his entire goal of going into the jungle is to find this tribe and destroy them so he can sleep peacefully , I guess . He has the obligatory role of the modern man forced to participate in the cannibalism , and it is properly disgusting . There is a rafting scene near the end of the film that is botched in the way that most b-movies botch something like sky-diving . It is so unrealistic and so campy that it is genuinely amusing . The editing , as well , is unbelievably cheap , like the rest of the movie . But as a cannibal film , this is about what you can expect . Horror fans should be entertained . It's not a classic , but it's a passable sample of its sub-genre .
544002	562732	116225	4.0	Horrendously prophetic .	So I watched Escape From L . A . after having recently made my way through both of Bruce Campbell's books ( the latter , unfortunately , seeming to have been thrown through the publication process simply because of the cult success of his literary debut ) , and I have been half-heartedly watching all of the films that he was in . Sadly , his role in this movie is one of the most ridiculous that I have ever seen , and I mean in general , not just Bruce Campbell roles . He is the epitome of the doomed B-movie actor , but why hire someone with such a massive cult following only to completely change his appearance in the movie ? I find it difficult to believe that they worried about him bringing down the Hollywood status of the movie ; Kurt Russell is one of my heroes , but he's hardly a Hollywood superstar . I saw Escape From New York when I was a kid , and I remember hating it passionately , and although I found this movie to be highly unimpressive , I wouldn't say that I hated it . It makes quite a strong political commentary , with a religious fanatic in the White House ( this time , frighteningly , appointed to a lifetime term ) , whose own daughter , curiously named Utopia , says things like " Now is the time to rise up against the president's corrupt theocracy of lies and terror ! ! " Mr . President has decided to move the nation's capital from Washington D . C . to his hometown , Lynchburg , Virginia . Lynchburg ? LA , at any rate , is now " the city of sin " ( which makes me wonder how Vegas is doing ) , and Snake Plissken ( Kurt Russell ) , is " the most notorious criminal in US history . " As is to be expected , no attempt is made to assign Plissken with a history that would in any way justify such a title , we just need to know that he's a real bad guy . He runs around talking like a real bad guy and acting like a real bad guy , all the while trying to retrieve an antidote from the real bad guys ( the government ) who have infected him with a virus which will give him 10 hours to retrieve a stolen black box containing the codes to control the world's energy transmission satellites . That , unfortunately , is not only more of a mouthful than I can form into a coherent sentence , but is also more of a mouthful than this movie can handle . Any movie with a main character that is called " the most notorious criminal in US history " and then later features that same character surfing a tsunami wave down Wilshire Blvd . in Los Angeles and then jumping onto the back of a moving car off of his surfboard is living dangerously if it tries to support too complex a premise . He is also , at one point , forced to play basketball for his life . There is something of a duality in this movie , in that it could just as easily be enjoyed by people who are genuinely impressed with the story , acting , and special effects as it could be by people who look at it as great fun just because of how wildly over the top it is . I guess I fall somewhere in between , because I thoroughly enjoy watching bad movies , although I have a hard time with special effects in general , which so often are a tool to cover shortcomings in other areas . This movie is packed with both special effects and shortcomings , so maybe the combination of the two creates something that is more than the sum of its parts . On the other hand , maybe it just comes out as a great big senseless mishmash of shoddy production values . Either way , I had a blast watching for the LA landmarks ?
544289	562732	118421	4.0	It's like Prison Break without the " break , " and taking place in a high school rather than a prison .	First of all , season 1 is intolerably bad . The prison is ridiculously unrealistic , the characters are so two dimensional they're nearly transparent , and the direction is terrible . It runs like a bad video of a junior high school play , characters wandering past the camera and uttering highly timed and rehearsed lines , passing off as random prison talk . Soon the show gets better , but not by much . The return from the commercial break is always accompanied by some ridiculous monologue by wheelchair-bound Augustus Hill , who is played impressively by Harold Perrineau . The only time his character is consistently bad is during the bad performance art monologues , most of which take place in an inexplicable rotating glass cube and generally have nothing to do with what's taking place in the show . Unfortunately , the bad ideas in Oz could fill an encyclopedia of several volumes . Consider the whole situation , first of all . Prisoners are able to hang out in plain sight getting drunk , doing drugs , and they not only have CD players ( CDs ? ? They might as well pass out steak knives ) , but all incoming mail is thoroughly examined by PRISONERS . Christ , the place is like a men's club with guards . Guards that don't do much . Near the end of season two , an older prisoner's grandson is diagnosed with leukemia , and all of the prisoners pitch in thick wads of $20 and $50 bills to help send him to Disneyworld to fulfill his dying wish . These have to be the richest prisoners in the world . Every single prisoner in Oz all of a sudden became caring , loving guys except Kenny Wangler , an irritating character but one of the only ones who is consistently convincing . Even Adibisi wanted to be nice . But that's okay , because there is no order or sense in the show , so even this is not much of a distraction . Later , shockingly , there is a boxing scene in which one inmate is wearing an " I Love Cops " t - shirt . In prison ! ! Can you imagine ? ? I have a cousin who was in prison a few years ago . I sent him an old picture of us with some friends in high school , and in the picture , one of my friends was holding an " I Love Cops " bumper sticker , and one of " the woods " ( guys who have been in prison for years and years ) saw the picture but just grabbed it and ripped it to shreds . My cousin got lucky . Kenny Wangler also constantly berates the guards and even more senior officers for not calling him Bricks . One of them even tried to bribe him to go to an English class . You may lose track of who is in charge , the prisoners or the guards . More than one investigator , for example , goes into the prison undercover and gets killed trying to stop the drug trade . Personally I would just stop letting prisoners inspect incoming mail rather than risk the lives of investigators . Let's see , what else ? Shillinger's son OD's in solitary and no one thinks to ask the guard how he got the drugs . He just . . . got them , I guess . And make sure to pay attention , otherwise you'll miss the reason why the prisoners have enough money to be able to afford ascellular dermal grafts when they get bad gums . I didn't know guests in maximum security prisons were afforded such luxurious treatment options . How about this , when Robson asks about Dr . Faraj's schedule so he can ask what race of gums he was given , Faraj is so terrified that he goes to the warden and quits his job on the spot . Do doctors and dentists not have the right to request not to see certain prisoners ? After Poet and O'Reilly make the announcement to the entire prison , Robson asks to see Dr . Faraj , and is escorted to his office , brought in without knocking , and the guard promptly leaves without a word . They might as well give him a gun . I shouldn't go on about stupid ideas in this show , but it's like a flood , I can't stop it . Who thought of the Chinese refugees who can't speak Chinese and who disappear en masse from sight unless they're needed ? Who thought of the goofy religious wars and all the reverend prisoners ? Who though of Robson's gum transplant ? What's the deal with Busmalis and Agamemnon ? Agamemnon because he clearly doesn't belong in prison and Busmalis because of the whole thing with his grandson . Macbeth , because it was nothing but a ridiculous means to an end , as it were . But what are the worst ideas ? Things that go nowhere , which are constant . An Irish man comes to the prison and builds a bomb . He threatens to blow up the entire prison , the bomb turns out to be a dud , and the episode ends with him being led away by the bomb squad after the entire prison is evacuated . Nothing is ever heard from him or about the whole situation again . It's like it never happened . In one episode , prisoners are given dogs to train . What the hell ? ? If that wasn't bad enough , during one training session , a guard fires his gun inside the prison walls as a training exercise . No one seems to mind . I also like how anytime some kind of altercation breaks out , the culprits are pulled aside , they don't say anything , and the guards or warden or sister Pete or whoever always says , " I hope you don't think I'm gonna let this go ! ! " And then they walk away and let it go . The audience won't remember . Maybe I'm spoiled by Prison Break , but Oz is just a goofy prison drama that might be better as a play . A short one . At least a low-budget movie . There is just not enough here to sustain a multi-season TV show . Then again , I watched six seasons of it on DVD . Sometimes I don't understand myself . . .
544412	562732	804461	4.0	" Go with God and a bag full of guns ? "	I bought Death Sentence because it looked to me like a genuine , well-made thriller and I've been a fan of Kevin Bacon ever since Tremors , which was one of my favorite films when I was a kid . Unfortunately , it very soon devolved into a boring , by-the-numbers revenge thriller , throwing away Bacon's talent . John Goodman is also a genuine talent that is genuinely wasted here . Bacon stars as Nick Hume , an unremarkable man but a good husband and father , good at his work and good with his family , until a tragedy costs the life of his oldest son , just as he was aspiring to the professional hockey world . One night at a gas station the boy is a the victim of a gang initiation , in which a young gangster kills him to gain entry into the gang . The attack is totally unprovoked , of course , unless you count a moment just earlier when the gangsters were street racing side-by-side and Nick flashes his brights at them to remind them to turn their lights on . I seem to remember seeing a movie where a killer would drive with his lights off and then kill the people that flashed their brights at him . Can't remember what it was , though . Anyway , Hume gets a sleazy , lazy lawyer to take the case against the kid who killed his son . The guy tells him that the most they can hope for is to make a deal where the kid will go to prison for a couple years , so Nick is understandably horrified . This mental giant of an attorney mentioned as one of their difficulties that the murder weapon " magically " disappeared . Maybe he's not used to taking murder cases where the killer doesn't leave the murder weapon , a complete set of fingerprints , and maybe a driver's license or credit card or at least a utility bill for some contact information . Magically . This , by the way , is where the movie first starts to go horribly wrong . When the gangster killed Hume's son , the other gangsters sped off without him , and he ran into the street cursing them , at which point a car slammed into him with enough speed to shatter both legs , to say nothing of the certain spinal injury , broken ribs , organ damage and fractured skull . He didn't get knocked over , that car PLOWED into him . Nevertheless , it doesn't occur to any lawyers later to connect the dots about the fact that Hume saw the murder with his own eyes and then saw the murderer get slammed into by a car . He still had to pick the kid out of a lineup ! ! Then later , the police occasionally come to Hume , begging him not to start a war and please stop what he's doing now ? all the while fully aware that he had murdered one of them because he was not satisfied with the conviction that he would have gotten . At one point , he asks the police for help , and he gets , " God help you . " NICE . Clearly , there's not a scrap of thought put into the script , but we can still hope for a fun ride . Sadly , we don't get that either . I was bothered to see John Goodman in such a stupid and pointless role , Bacon is clearly wasting his time , but he's such a good actor that most of the time it's as if he's struggling to squeeze himself into a movie that's too small for him . But the real problem is the gangsters . It's hard to make this kind of thriller when the antagonists are such clownish caricatures . The gang members are mostly stuntmen who are apparently trying out acting for a while , and it is clear why they don't act . After Hume kills the new kid , Joe , there is a laughable scene at a bar where they all tearfully drink to his memory , talking about how much they loved him and how he was a brother to them . It's hard to watch a lot of guys who are not actors struggling to act like hardened gangsters struggling to act emotional . Soon there's a chase scene where the gang is chasing Hume through a parking garage . He runs up one level after another , setting off car alarms all along the way . Why the car alarms , you may wonder ? I don't know , maybe he knows these aren't the smartest guys in the world and he doesn't want them to get lost . Maybe he just doesn't have a can of paint with him to paint arrows on the ground , so car alarms are the best way to make sure they can keep track of him . The end of the film devolves into stereotypical gunfights and bloodshed , with an unexpected turn at the end of Hume and the head gangster both with multiple gunshot wounds but no bullets sitting next to each other on a bench . Pretty interesting confrontation , I hadn't seen that before . It's too bad it had to come after an hour and a half of garbage ! Death Sentence is a good effort , it just doesn't work . Bacon's heart is in the right place but he isn't given anything interesting to do , Goodman's character is pointless entirely so it's a shame that he also has to dumb himself down for it , and James Wan is directing the movie for no other reason than because he directed Saw and the almost strikingly similar Dead Silence . It's too bad . It could have been so much more .

You may remember that Kate Beckinsale was featured even more prominently on the poster for Underworld 2 than she was for the original movie . Now , you might notice that the poster for the third installment in the series features Bill Nighy in full , cadaverous glory . So the reason Bill Nighy's character is not only featured so prominently on the movie's poster but is also alive again ( you may remember that he was spectacularly dispatched in the first film ) is because , as promised by the studios , this is " the prequel you've been waiting for . " This is , of course , studio talk for " this movie will answer all your Underworld questions " and " no , Kate Beckinsale isn't in it . " The rest of the cast , however , human and mechanical alike , are in their best form , so it's surprisingly easy not to miss her . I've watched both previous Underworld films within the last two days , and the close proximity of the two movies reminds me how amazingly similar they are in story and appearance , so I anticipated more of the same with part 3 and I was hardly disappointed . Fans of the series are sure to get a kick out of this obligatory extra movie , although it was hardly justified given the first two . Maybe I'm a callous , modern American movie-goer without the necessary attention span , but I just wasn't really feeling the need for another two hours about the war between the werewolves and lycans . At any rate , when it all started , the vampires were in control . They ruled the lands and the werewolves were their slaves , they were used to protect and build the vampire kingdom . The werewolves are unable to ever take human form because of the collars they are forced to wear around their necks , and Viktor holds the key . But since slave societies have an understandable tendency to eventually organize and revolt against their oppressors , it's safe to assume that Viktor's authority is soon to be challenged . Lucian , the Lycan leader that we met in the original film ( the one that Viktor and everyone else didn't believe could possibly still be alive ) , although a slave himself , has been amassing a rebel Lycan army and , with the support of his true love Sonia ( Viktor's vampire daughter ) , he declares a war against the vampires that will last for centuries . The movie has exactly the same look as the first two movies , although Beckinsale and her husband Les Wiseman , the director of the first two movies , have taken off , leaving directing duties to Patrick Tatopoulos , who had never directed a feature film before but who has an astonishing list of credits in the special effects and art departments . And his work shows , too . He knows how to create great horror creatures , and the movie takes place in an undisclosed but effective enough corner of the medieval world , where their uppity Shakespearean language doesn't look quite so out of place as in the previous two movies , when they were surrounded by cell phones and handguns and high technology . Unfortunately , the werewolves and vampires are still played by human actors , and the movie is unable to get past that ancient horror hurdle created by the fact that humans pulling their lips back to reveal fangs is simply not scary . It never has been and it never will be . And that colored contact lens thing , man . Don't even get me started on that . I can't shake the feeling that that was a goofy cliché back in the late 90's . Marilyn Manson stretched that as far as it would go but it's over now ! Move on ! In fact , hold on a second ? " ATTENTION MOVIE STUDIOS ? COLORED CONTACT LENSES IN ANY MOVIE , IN ANY GENRE , WILL NEVER EVER EVER LOOK LIKE ANYTHING OTHER THAN COLORED CONTACT LENSES . PLEASE MAKE A NOTE OF IT . " OK , sorry , I just had to get that out . But on the other hand , at least they've stopped doing that thing where a vampire will hold a victim at arm's length , stretch their mouth open as wide as possible , and slowly move their distended jaws down to the exposed neck so the camera can get a sufficient shot of the fangs so that anyone who might have gotten up to get popcorn will make it back before the fangs are off screen . I can put up with a lot at the movies , but the next time I see THAT little trick I'm walking out of the theater . There is a curious debate raised by the fact that for a good portion of the film , Lucian carelessly blows away his own kind , the lycans , by rationalizing that they are simply mindless beasts , despite the fact that their behavior clearly displays intelligence . There is something to be said about that rationalization , but I don't care to go into it here because it will no doubt make my review prohibitively long and then no one will really care to read it anyway . Hopefully I'm no there already . Suffice it to say that Underworld 3 is a fan's film . There are films that are brilliant critical successes , there are films that are popular successes , and there are films that fail spectacularly in both arenas but remain genuinely loved by die-hard fans . It's not hard to see where Underworld 3 belongs .
543809	562732	100114	4.0	Seagal vs . freaky Jamaican crackheads ?	So Seagal plays a DEA detective named John Hatcher who lost his partner on a drug investigation into , surprise surprise , Colombia ! Not to brag or anything , but my father was born and raised in Colombia ( hence my last name ) , and now he's a doctor in California , so no matter what the movies would have you believe , there are some things other than drug dealers and cocaine that come out of Colombia ! At any rate , in a drug bust gone bad , Hatcher loses his partner and accidentally kills a naked Colombian prostitute , inspiring him to go to confession , somewhere that I have never seen him go before in any of his movies , before or since . It was actually pretty interesting . Seagal has a tendency to come off as almost asexual the way he never gets much involved with women other than as a plot device and the way the occasional seduction attempt , whether by a stripper or by a lover , never piques the slightest bit of interest from him . He's all get-the - bad-guys all the time . But in the confession booth , he confesses to having lied , sold drugs , falsified evidence , and even slept with informants in order to get the information he needed to put the bad guys behind bars ( I hope I'm not getting in trouble with God by telling you this ? ) . The priest tells him to go to his family , so he decides it's time to retire from the force . The next third of the movie is an exercise in the paper-thin characterization characteristic of Seagal's films . Marked For Death is the story of Seagal against a band of mystic Jamaican drug dealers , and these guys have no discretions about pushing their products in broad daylight . Hatcher goes back to visit his old high school coach , Max ( a minimal effort by Keith David ) , and right in the middle of practice there are some of these dread-locked crackheads sitting right there in the bleachers peddling crack to some bookworm-looking high school girls . Maybe I just had a sheltered experience in high school , but I didn't know crack dealers and crackheads hung out AT SCHOOL in the MIDDLE OF THE DAY . At any rate , it's not long before Hatcher learns how evil these guys are . They're not just peddling crack to high school kids , but the coach has been losing football players regularly to their drugs , they engage in smartass stare-downs with Max , and since that's not enough , his 13-year-old niece died in their crackhouse . Ah , OK . We get the picture . I'm sure they also torture puppies and beat up old women , and maybe steal candy from children too , just for good measure . Is it really this hard to establish who the bad guys are ? 13-year-old niece died in their crackhouse . Wow . Anyway . Not only does the movie not know how to develop villains without resorting to what basically boils down to movie name-calling , where evil deeds are shallowly assigned to them through dialogue , but they also don't know how they should act . The leader of the drug dealers , is named Screwface , and I suppose that alone should tell you something about the kind of movie this is . Screwface is a cartoonish Jamaican man with these bright , bizarrely green eyes , which I am guess must be an important part of his character because he spends a good majority of his screen time with his eyes half bulging out of his head . His favorite means of intimidation is to scream really loud in his wildly overblown Jamaican accent with his face quite literally less than an inch away from whoever he's yelling at . This guy likes to get so into guys ' faces that he has to turn his head to the side so their noses don't touch . All I could think about was how the poor guys would deal with his breath . Man , they do not want you to forget that these guys are Jamaican , by the way . Their accents are so exaggerated and overblown that for most of the movie it's nearly impossible to understand them . Not that it matters . It doesn't matter what they're saying , all you need to know is that everything that comes out of their mouths is some kind of evil drug-related thing , they're just the psychos that peddle drugs and kill people . The movie must have been a huge hit in Jamaica ! My biggest problem with the movie is that the theatrics , particularly of the bad guys , as I've described , are spectacularly goofy , even for a Seagal film . They are so cartoonish and weird that it's impossible to take them as anything other than a goofball b-movie creation , something slapped together to provide fodder to whom Seagal can distribute his characteristic brand of smack-down retribution . But there is also a bizarre kind of mysticism in the movie that just makes it all come off as weird . For example , a mystic , I guess you would call her , at one point puts some kind of curse on Screwface by ( if I remember correctly ) spitting mouthfuls of Bacardi onto a live rooster that's hanging upside down before beheading it and dripping its blood onto a picture of Screwface . Hmm . Interesting . Sadly , it's this same woman that warns Hatcher that his family has been " marked for death " by these people , meaning they've got some voodoo hex on them . Not to belittle anyone , but if I was told that my family had been cursed by people like that , I would just laugh at it . Hatcher doesn't strike me as the kind of guy to take much stock in freaky voodoo curses ! But the set-up , as you can see , is pretty standard for a Seagal film . Unique villains , I guess you could say , although not very impressive . Definitely the weirdest film of Seagal's early career ?
544436	562732	1142800	4.0	" Super-Sized Stripper Smacks Spectator " ? ' Madea Goes To Jail ' Review ?	I guess I should start off by admitting that I've never seen any of the previous Madea films , and that I went into this movie knowing nothing about it except that it's the latest in a long line of similar films which have gotten about the same public response as your average Steven Seagal movie . And that's not good , in case you're wondering . That's okay though , because during the opening credits we see various headlines zooming across the screen , like " Super-Sized Stripper Smacks Spectator , " and we get the general idea . Madea has always been a problem for the police , she has a rap sheet a mile long and doesn't feel any need to change her behavior . The movie comes dangerously close to being another one of those intolerable comedies where Eddie Murphy or Martin Lawrence star as every character in the movie . Madea's family are clearly meant to resemble the Klumps , although I would be lying if I said that they were not entertaining . Uncle Joe in particular is a goofy caricature , but he's a hilarious one . The problem with the movie is that it tries to be two very different kinds of films , and it succeeds in being those two kinds of films , but the combination of the two styles kills this one completely . Half the movie is a light-hearted comedy in the vein of the Nutty Professors and Big Momma's House , but the other half of the film is a very serious drama that deals effectively with very serious issues . Life Is Beautiful is the only movie I've ever seen that really succeeds brilliantly at this story-telling technique , but that movie worked because it tied the two genres together . Life also comes close . This one , on the other hand , just throws the two halves in the same room and then sits back while they sit there not working . Dr . Phil makes a surprisingly hilarious cameo as a therapist that tries in vain to get Madae to admit that she has an anger management problem , which ultimately lands her in jail . Meanwhile , Josh Hardaway , the Assistant District Attorney , is experiencing a wonderfully developing career , until he meets Candace , a childhood friend who has fallen into a desperate situation after years of drugs and prostitution . He tries as hard as he can to help her despite the hysterical and ridiculous whining of his horrid fiancé . This is one of the worst parts of the movie , by the way . There is nothing worse than a romantic comedy that pits two suitors ( male or female ) against each other for the love of the main character , when one of the suitors is clearly tailor made to be the right choice and the other is an intolerable jerk-off . See 27 Dresses and you'll know what I mean . Josh's fiancé in this movie is unfortunately such a nagging , conniving wench that it's impossible to have any feelings towards her other than animosity . This is not a good start for a movie whose story is driven by the characters . Almost from the moment she enters the movie I was just waiting for Josh to come to his senses and boot her to the curb where she belongs . The issues of prostitution and drugs and drugs are taken very seriously , there's even a pretty intensely emotional scene involving one of the key male characters , who breaks down completely under the weight of a tragic event for which he has never been able to forgive himself . The acting is superb in this scene , but it is genuinely bizarre when Madea shows up again and we realize what the rest of the movie is like . It's impossible to tell if this is supposed to be a comedy or a drama , because both elements are done fairly well but they simply don't work when put together . I don't need my movies to be categorized , in fact I am pleasantly surprised when films cleverly bend genres , but this one gives us one character with a truly frightening history of drugs and prostitution and another character who lifts a car up on giant forklifts and then drops it 30 feet onto the pavement when a callous owner steals her spot at K-Mart . Ultimately Madea and Candace get locked up in the same prison , and the two stories attempt in vain to come together . I won't say that all of the character are utterly uninteresting , although there are several points where a stupendous lack of screen writing ability is made abundantly clear . Consider this exchange between Candace and her new cell-mate , who happens to be one of her old , close friends ? Candace : " You look good . " Cellmate : " Yeah , I'm doin ' good . How you doin ' ? " Are you serious ? I'm doin ' good ? How you doin ' ? Is this an inside joke ? You're both in prison ! Who says they're doin ' good or asks someone else how they're doin ' when both of them are in prison ? But maybe I'm nitpicking . There are moments of fun in the movie , there are a few laugh out loud moments , and there are some moments of pretty impressive acting , but the movie as a whole , unfortunately , adds up to something much , much less than the sum of its parts .
544632	562732	161083	4.0	Hmm , that's a good question .	SPOILERS SPOILERS What's the Worst That Could Happen ? Is a film that places two hugely recognizable actors into two perfectly opposite roles and pits them against each other , but it can't come up with a good enough reason for having done this except to have them fighting over the ownership of a ring which has nothing but sentimental or superstitious value for either one of them . Danny DeVito , plays the part of Max Fairbanks , a massively wealthy businessman having financial trouble ( ' TECHNICAL procedure ' ) , and Martin Lawrence plays the part of Kevin Caffrey , an intelligent ( supposedly ) criminal who knows his way around an art gallery . While DeVito is probably one of the most charismatic actors working today ( despite the fact that he rarely plays anything but dirtbag characters ) , Lawrence , at the same time , is one of our most trying comic actors . He is a fan's actor that mainly stars in films that the audience will hate unless they were there just to see him ( such as the sad , ridiculous mess that was Big Momma's House ) . This is not the case very often , although he does work well with certain other ( generally more talented ) actors , such as the brilliant Will Smith in Bad Boys , Eddie Murphy in Life , and I even enjoyed his performance with Luke Wilson in Blue Streak ( the forthcoming sequels for two of these movies , by the way , I am very much looking forward to , despite not being much of a Lawrence fan myself ) . ( spoilers ) At any rate , DeVito and Lawrence have acting styles that are just about as different as the characters that they play in this film , which is probably why they clash so badly . At no point do they have any chemistry onscreen , even at the end of the film when Fairbanks covers for Caffrey ( but maybe this is because of the stupididty involved in this claim - since Fairbanks was in a police station accusing Caffrey of robbing his house . Is the detective not expected to notice this because he's gay ? ) . But even more than that , the movie is centered around Caffrey getting this ring back because his girlfriend gave it to him and Fairbanks wanting to keep it because he thinks it's some sort of good luck charm , a sign that his business luck is about to change . Fairbanks is ridiculously rich , and Caffrey has much bigger things to concern himself with , like the ease with which he can get his hands on enormously valuable paintings , so why should we care ? So we get a film about two guys fighting like 8 year olds over this little trinket , and even though you want to root for Caffrey for caring so much for something that his new girlfriend gave him , you at the same time desperately want the movie to avoid that hideous cliché and do something original . I suppose it does do something original with having these two grown men fighting over something so small and trivial , but it makes it impossible to care about the outcome . We don't want Fairbanks to keep the ring because it was the one thing that Caffrey really didn't steal , and we don't want Caffrey to get it back because then this would be another cheesy comedy about some dirtbag trying to impress a pretty girl , as was the case with bad comedies like Half Baked . So while Caffrey and Fairbanks are each tripping over themselves trying to become lord of the ring , we are occasionally introduced to well-known actors who play parts in the movie for reasons which even they don't seem to sure of . The most glaring appearance is from William Fichtner , who plays a homosexual detective for no other reason than to have a homosexual detective in the movie . Maybe they wanted to distract us from the idiocy in the rest of the film . Here is a hugely talented actor who is completely wasted in this moronic role , which does nothing but fit in with the goofy slapstick antics that Martin occasionally goes off into . John Leguizamo , similarly , is an enormously talented actor who is never given a chance to really shine in the movie . There is a scene where Lawrence and Leguizamo impersonate Middle Eastern businessmen to get into a building , and the way that they fake the accents is a perfect example of their talents as actors . While Leguizamo yadda yaddas pretty much the same things over and over so it's clear he's not really speaking any kind of language , he at least spoke up and had some semblance of an idea of how to fake an accent . Lawrence , on the other hand , could do nothing but mumble and grunt and groan , inspiring the audience to do much the same , both because he was so bad at what he was trying to do and because the scene as a whole was one of the worst scenes in the movie , which is no good in the first place . At the opening of the film , we are introduced to Caffrey , Lawrence's character , admiring a painting in an art gallery . An employee at the gallery approaches and tells him that the sports exhibition is next week , which reminded me of the times that Julia Roberts was kicked out of dress shops in Pretty Woman and Runaway Bride , both of which were delightful . At this early point in the film , Caffrey shows her up by identifying the painting as a fake , making us think that we are about to enjoy a movie about a black man who defies all of the stereotypes that uppity white women like this seem to have towards them . Instead , he goes into a little dance , ensuring that , from language to being a criminal , not a single stereotype is going to be challenged here . Pretty much from this point on , the movie goes precipitously downhill .
544010	562732	89880	5.0	Wow , 1985 wasn't such a good year for Stallone !	In watching First Blood Part 2 the first thing that I was struck by was that , as I was watching for classic cheesy moments , one of my favorite reasons to watch old action movies , I soon noticed that the cheese-factor in this movie is astronomical . In fact , the entire movie is basically a 97-minute cheese moment , it never stops ! Also , I just noticed on the IMDb that First Blood Part 2 ( probably the most awkward name for a sequel until the much-anticipated Jason X Part 2 comes out at some yet to be determined date ) is that it was nominated for an Oscar for Best Sound Effects Editing , but was also nominated at the Razzie Awards for Worst Supporting Actress , Worst New Star ( this was definitely a deserved win , by the way ) , and Worst Director , and WON for Worst Screenplay , Worst Original Song , Worst Actor ( also in Rocky IV , which is a distantly better movie ! ) , and Worst Picture . Don't miss this one ! Rambo has now been in a prison camp for 5 years breaking rocks and such , when suddenly a military man approaches and tells him that the United States has a certain sensitive situation in Vietnam that could earn Rambo his freedom , were he to help them to solve it . It seems that there are still missing POWs in Vietnam and they need Rambo to get in there and take pictures of where they're being held so they can send in a tactical search and rescue team . Rambo , of course , is trained in search and rescue himself ( and also he's freaking Rambo ) so he can't bring himself to simply take pictures and then leave the Americans in captivity , so he takes the mission of the rescue entirely upon himself . He is helped along the way by the astonishingly beautiful Co Bao , a Vietnamese freedom fighter . This woman is unbelievably beautiful , but sadly she does nothing but stop the already unimpressive movie in its tracks as we're asked to believe this girl is a militant freedom fighter . And the fact that Julia Nickson-Soul ( the much deserved winner of that Worst New Star award ) is absolutely incapable of covering up the fact that she is a native English speaker didn't help matters either . The accent on that woman in this movie is hilarious ! There are some corrupt American officials and policies involved in the mission as well , all providing a sufficient set-up for Rambo to trample through the movie distributing Rambo - style justice to wherever it may be needed . I have to say the first movie wasn't even very good , but the descent that Part 2 has made is genuinely surprising . Definitely the worst of the not-very-impressive series , but it's still tons of fun . That should tell you all you need to know !
544237	562732	279784	5.0	Back when commercials meant something . . .	The thing that really struck me about this short comedy is that it is all about a guy who makes a radio commercial for a local donut shop because he actually cares about the well-being of its owner , a woman named Dora with whom he is clearly romantically interested ( and who is clearly romantically interested in him as well ) . In a time when we are bombarded with obnoxious advertisements and endless streams of commercials , it is indeed interesting to look back to a time when it would be acceptable to make a movie about making a commercial . Today , commercials have become so widespread that they're like a cancer on society , you can't go anywhere anymore without being advertised at , they even show commercials before the previews start at the movie theaters now . And I thought I spent $10 to get in so I could get AWAY from the commercials . Shirley Temple is not the star of this short film , although it's easy to see why she is so good at coming to the forefront , because as is to be expected , she steals every scene that she's in , even though she is the only person who doesn't fit in at all . The film concerns a school band taught by a charming teacher named Andy , although all of the students appear to be about junior high school age , except for 5 year old Shirley . Unfortunately , the movie loses its way completely in the second half , with the thin script being abandoned completely at about the time that people start fighting . An improvised one-man performance of Little Red Riding Hood is thrown in out of nowhere , and then we are treated to a couple of pie throwing sight gags ( which are not entirely without effect ) before the movie makes short work of solving the crisis that it introduced about Dora's struggling bakery , as well as the budding romance between her and Andy . It wastes a lot of time in the last act and is hardly up to par with the short comedies of the time , but is still a charming little film .
544139	562732	85636	5.0	What's this about a witch , now ?	Almost universally hated for being such a digression from the much known and loved Halloween movies , Halloween III comes along almost like John Carpenter and Debra Hill , who produced it , are trying to sneak up on audiences and show them something they weren't expecting . While it's true that it has absolutely nothing to do with the two Michael Meyers slashers that came before it other than the fact that we see commercials for the original Halloween film on TV sets in this movie a couple times , it's not true that this is one of the worst horror films ever made , as I've heard it called very many times . I saw the movie about ten years ago , when I was in junior high school , and the two things that I remember were bugs crawling out of the masks while they were on peoples ' heads and that god-awful music they played during the Silver Shamrock commercials . So when I watched it again tonight I tried to look at it as a separate film from the other Halloween movies , because I think that it's association with them is a large part of why so many people hate it . In a horror series that at the time of this writing has spawned seven sequels , including this one , it's the one movie that simply doesn't belong . Unfortunately , even as a separate film , Halloween III doesn't have much going for it . Clearly , there was enough stock put into the disturbing nature of the crime involved , since we are not given a reason for its existence . An elderly toy maker has developed a scheme to sell masks rigged with secret electronic devices , then on Halloween night at 9pm stage a Big Giveaway on TV , at which point he will broadcast a special commercial I supposed reminiscent of those commercials in Japan that are supposed to give you seizures . This version will activate the electronic devices lodged in the masks and cause them to somehow turn kids heads into piles of creepy crawlies . What is the purpose behind this scheme ? What does this guy hope to achieve ? And what the hell does Stonehenge have to do with anything ? His hordes of robotic assistants is at least explainable by his need for secrecy given what he's really up to in that factory ( and I imagine they have something to do with his remarkable ability to essentially hold an entire town hostage without even a single person leaving and complaining to authorities . Early in the film , a guy runs frantically into a gas station asking for help and is brought to a hospital to receive medical attention . Once there , a well-dressed gentleman walks calmly into his hospital room and pulls his skull apart , then just as calmly walks outside , gets into his car , douses himself with gasoline and promptly sets himself on fire . The subsequent mess is left to the hospital staff to clean up , as the car is left smoldering in the parking lot the next day without an inch of police tape around it and a lab technician is left to pore through the ashes . What is truly funny is the length of time that this technician spends sifting through these ashes before she realizes that they are nothing but car parts , a stupendous explosion of idiocy that she describes as a ' colossal boo-boo . ' The doctor working at the hospital takes it upon himself to do a little investigating into the situation , traveling to the town that houses the Silver Shamrock factory , which of course sports an Irish caricature of a man presiding over the local hotel . I have to admit that I thought that the ' misfire ' scene was pretty impressive , and is one of at least a few scenes that tend to argue that this movie deserved a title that would not have cast it in an eternal shadow . For the first thirty minutes or so , the movie is very impressive . The opening shot of the man running as fast as he can out of a calm night is especially unsettling , as is that entire chase between him and his robotic pursuers , whom we know nothing about at the time . But the more we learn about what's really going on , the less believable the movie becomes , until it hits rock bottom with Conal Cochran , the evil toymaker , gleefully giving Challis , the investigating doctor , a tour of his underground facility and a detailed description of his wicked plans , coming dangerously close to a Scooby-Doo ending . I really don't think that the movie is as bad as so many people seem to think , it's just too bad that it starts out so well but by the end the last attacks of the final un-killable robot are simply tiresome . By the end , I was just waiting for it to end , but at the beginning I found it very interesting . I think that these two things balance themselves out in terms of the quality of the movie , and then the association with the other two previous Halloween films is just another nail in this movie's coffin .
544076	562732	177971	5.0	This film's main redeeming value was the fact that it was based on a true story , and it vaguely communicated the events of that story . However , it was also badly distorted by the influences of Hollywood .	The Perfect Storm is an extremely difficult kind of film to make . No matter how you approach it , the budget is going to have to be huge , and there will definitely be some scenes that will simply be impossible to film on location . Hence , special effects are necessary . Given that , even though I generally feel that less is more as far as special effects , I respect the extensive use of special effects in this film . Without computer generated images , this film would never have been made . However , it should be noted that the convenience of special effects led to a high degree of questionable and , at some points , laughable excesses which were portrayed on the screen during The Perfect Storm . It was hard enough for me that every single external shot was obviously computer generated , but then the activities of the waves themselves during the storm were exaggerated to ridiculous proportions . First , yes there are waves that get that big and much bigger every day in the open ocean , but they are also several miles long . The constant straight up and straight down of the waves in the film is simply not true . However , when these waves collide , they do create very tall and very steep waves called ' rogue ' waves , as they were called in the film , but these were pretty much the only kind of waves ever shown in the whole movie . Obviously they are more dramatic to watch , but they are not a continually occurring phenomenon . Even worse , I noticed a few scenes where obscenely huge waves ( it is physically impossible for open ocean waves to be that big without a tremendous force like an earthquake , by the way ) were shown completely motionless for seconds at a time . It was like the wave was some huge solid form just under the surface , and the water was just running over it . And then there was the wave that broke and toppled the Andrea Gail over longways ( yes , I'm talking about the wave that George Clooney was screaming at ) . Waves just do not break like that in the open ocean , especially not waves as tremendous as that one . Basically , the storm scenes were simply exploded to impossibly huge proportions , which was one of the many ways that Hollywood manipulated this film . The other major problem concerned some of the things that were added into the story to make the film easier for a mass audience . ( spoilers ) This is not a happily-ever-after film , it's a true story . Everyone dies . So what they did was they had things like Bobby Shatford's ( Mark Wahlberg ) monologue to his distant future wife ( " . . . it's only love . . . " ) , and of COURSE , Captain Billy Tyne ( George Clooney ) deliberately allows himself to be taken down with the ship . How perfect . I'm not saying this didn't happen , maybe Tyne really went down as the traditional captain should , and maybe Shatford really did attempt a bit of telecommunication , but that is irrelevent . The point is that we don't know what happened , everything that you see in the second half of this film is pure speculation , and it is heavily sugar-coated , which bothers me . They even went to the extent of portraying the characters as though fishing was something that they needed just as much as food or water . Remember the scene when Cpt . Tyne says " Let's go fishing " as they are beginning their final fishing trip ? All of the guys get so excited that you would think they'd just heard that they won some kind of world sword-fishing championship . That scene , by the way , establishes the " they died doing what they loved " layer of sugar-coating . How sweet . I'll be the first to honor the reality of the tragedy portrayed in The Perfect Storm . In fact , the one Coast Guard paramedic that died in the rescue attempt , whose real name was Rick Smith , was a close friend of my father's the year before this mission took place . They worked together in the National Guard for years , they even shared a desk . When they were moved , my father was stationed in California and Smith was stationed on the east coast , where he soon received his fateful assignment . If it had been the other way around , it could easily have been someone portraying my father in this film . Clearly , I have a bit of an emotional bias toward this film , but I think that it was a little too excessive , particularly in the special effects department and the Hollywood sugar-coating . It's a great story and an entertaining movie , but I just don't think that it needed to be blown up that big in order to adequately portray the events that took place in the Pacific that year .
543824	562732	23669	5.0	An odd little film indeed .	While claiming that this film borders on kiddie porn may be something of a stretch , it's not much of a stretch . It is certainly odd to consider the parents agreeing to let their kids perform in such a movie , which is racy , to say the least . The spectacle of Shirley Temple swinging her four-year-old hips around for a crowd of hooting four-year-old boys is disturbing indeed . This is one of Shirley Temple's earliest works for which the modern audience , or at least the few people who still manage or bother to see it , are most unimpressed , if not outright offended . The movie is a stark illustration of some of the difference between 1930s society and today's , as this film would not have the slightest chance of getting made in the 21st Century , and I like to see that I'm not the only person who's glad for that . Nonetheless , it seems that her appearance in this film , as well as the three that she appeared in previous to it , played a significant part in the explosion of her career as a child actor . Here's this girl who started acting at age four , stopped before her 20th birthday , and there she is appearing in all manner of glamorousness at the 1998 Academy Awards , four decades after her last performance as an actress . The extent of her popularity and success is clearly apparent , but this movie is more of a look at how differently movies were made in the 1930s as opposed to today , rather than an enlightening look at what it was about Shirley Temple that made her so tremendously popular . It seems clear that War Babies was an unintelligent film that exploited what must have been Temple's staggering cuteness . I can certainly understand that , because I have a sister who is 5 years old and she absolutely floors me , but the thought of her dancing around like Shirley does in this movie is not cute in the slightest . What is probably most odd about this movie is that all of the parents of the kids that appeared in it probably absolutely loved it . I imagine that not many of these parents are around anymore , so sadly it becomes all the more apparent as to why the film has such a small audience , and its obscurity I don't think can be chalked up entirely to the fact that it is more than 70 years old . Normally I am bothered by the fact that there are so many people in today's audience that refuse to watch older movies , simply because they are black and white . Imagine someone refusing to watch Schindler's List because it wasn't in color . Unbelievable . In this case , however , I don't find it upsetting in the least that this movie has become so rarely seen , because a movie that features a scene as disturbing as the finale of this one ( in which a little boy holds up an over-sized bobby-pin , making a genuinely disturbing implication to another little boy ) is not exactly a classic not to be overlooked . Quite the contrary . Overlook at will .
544659	562732	74080	5.0	Not quite as pathetic as it looks .	The cover of ? Gator Bait makes it look like a ridiculous , mindless film with few redeeming qualities other than an abundance of inexplicable nudity . While there is nudity in the film ( and unnecessary nudity , at that ) , it is a relatively low quantity of it , and there are even a few elements of the film that were well done ? even if extremely few . The acting on all parts was just awful , but some performances were less idiotic than others . While it's true that the line ' Boys will be boys ' was uttered in response to an attempted rape , and one of the men attempting to capture Desiree actually SHOOK HIS FIST at her in one scene , it's not entirely the actors ' faults that this movie was impossible to take seriously . Nope , even if ineffectively , all of the actors delivered honest performances ? it's the SCREENWRITER that should be drug out into the street and shot . And the cinematographer was no genius either . The day-for-night photography was some of the worst I've ever seen ? even worse than that seen in Dr . No , which was filmed 14 years earlier than ? Gator Bait . Also , there is so much ridiculous dialogue in this movie that it becomes a form of comic relief in itself ( ' Leroy , you pick that boy up or I'm gonna blow yer head off ! ' ) . And I better not even get started on Desiree's laughable lines . It's no secret that ? Gator Bait is cheese . Everything about the film is ugly ? especially those damn actors . Some of these guys are so ugly that sometimes it's hard to believe that they're real people . But despite this , they make for an effective team of angry ( and excessively horny ) rednecks , and the way that they get picked off one by one by this country girl not only provides an ironic bit of an interesting story , but also illustrates the extent of their collective stupidity . In the final shot of the film , with Pa standing in the swamp , the camera tilts slowly down to his reflection on the water , providing an unexpected hint toward meaningful direction . But for the most part , this is garbage . You just can't take something like this seriously at all . Let me put it in the immortal words of the great Sam Gerard , ' Who's the ugliest , dumbest , most inbred country son of a bitch out here ? ' Well , whoever that person is , he or she is sure to get a kick out of ? Gator Bait .
544907	562732	478087	5.0	How to ruin a fascinating true story .	Ah , Las Vegas , the city of lights . The place that probably offers more false promises than anywhere else in the world , Hollywood included . I've never been much of a gambler myself , usually when I go there I plan a given amount of money to gamble with and , once it's gone ( because I understand in advance that I'm gonna lose it ) then I stop and go back to my buddies and concentrate on getting nicely drunk . But cards are even less my thing . My friends back in Venice Beach had almost nightly poker tournaments that I couldn't get myself interested in to save my life , so my experience in gambling real money on card games is almost nonexistent . Nevertheless , I have an endless fascination with Vegas , and the true story of those people from MIT who raked in hundreds of thousands of dollars by counting cards at the blackjack tables should have been a great movie . Unfortunately , 21 is not it . The movie deals with the true story of those MIT students , but the movie is so heavily fictionalized that it's nearly impossible to tell what really happened under what ultimately turns out to be a twisted mass of Hollywood clichés . Jim Sturgess plays Ben Campbell , a college student graduating from MIT and about to fulfill his lifelong dream of attending Harvard Medical School . The only problem is that he doesn't have any money and Harvard Med will run him $300 , 000 . Since he lives in a world that contains one single scholarship opportunity and not a hint of student loans ( seriously , with an academic history like Ben's , there are about a million ways to get the money he needs ) , he sees his chances of going to Harvard Med slipping away . Soon he meets a professor , Micky Rosa ( Kevin Spacey ) who introduces him to a carefully designed card-counting scheme involving himself and a few of his most gifted students . They all head to Vegas and try to beat the system , while security chief Cole Williams ( Laurence Fishburne ) lurks in the darkened security office surrounded by TV screens watching out for people like them . I wanted to see a movie about the real story , something almost documentary-like that tells not only how they beat the Vegas system but also how they got caught and what happened afterwards , but 21 plays more like a completely fictional story . It's like a cheap version of Ocean's 11 except the only laws being broken are when Williams drags various characters into the casino basement to , ah , knock some sense out of them . I have no idea how card counting works , I'm just not a math guy . The movie doesn't concern itself with helping us understand it either , beyond some quickly edited sequences showing the main characters devising an intricate counting and communication scheme that will allow them to work together in the casinos without anyone realizing that they are a team . The problem is that the card counting itself requires a tremendous intellect , but the characters are phenomenally stupid . Are we supposed to believe that the same people who perfected this counting scheme would come up with signals so stupidly obvious as linking your arms behind your back when the deck's hot ? It was bad enough that they all constantly glance nervously at each other whenever they're in the same room , but that arm-linking thing was amazing . Every single time ! ! Didn't they ever think it would be a good idea to change things up a little bit ? It would require a stupendous quantity of incompetence on the part of the security administration to miss THAT . Even worse is the fact that in order to remind us that they're humans , the characters have to make drastic mistakes , but drastic gambling mistakes done well will give you something like the poker scene at the end of Casino Royale . Here , they get dunk and blow their cover or make gambling errors that can only be described as purely moronic , and the screenplay is more concerned with cheesy relationships between the characters that only distract from what the story is really about . Pearl Harbor had the same problem . We want to see a story about a major historical event , not some idiotic romance between Josh Hartnett and whoever that girl was . Even worse , nothing is told about what happened after they were caught . They won't go to jail because counting cards isn't illegal ( and shouldn't be ) , but the movies ties everything up with so much obviously fabricated nonsense that it's nearly impossible to walk out of the theater without feeling cheated . And in a movie about card-counting and taking Vegas for hundreds of thousands of dollars , it's the casinos who should feel cheated , not the audience .
544798	562732	95956	5.0	" This Film Is Dedicated to the Gallant People of Afghanistan " - ' Rambo III ' Review . . .	In preparing to watch the latest installment of the Rambo series , I've gone back and re - watched all of the original three films , which I hadn't seen in probably 15 years . Unfortunately , they are so uniformly bad that it has taken me now over a year to get through the three of them . I finished watching part III today and , like the two films before it , it was a notably underwhelming cinematic experience . By this point in the series , the Rambo formula is worked out in every detail . Rambo just wants to be left alone but then gets sucked into some brutally violent situation which , again , he has to take care of all on his own . He doesn't really play well with others , you see . Just as we found him languishing in a prison labor camp at the beginning of the second movie , Rambo is now living the dubious life of a monk in Thailand who takes breaks from the monastery to head into Bangkok and make some extra money in the stick-fighting competitions , which he promptly turns over to the monks to help build the monastery . He likes the feeling of belonging that he gets from living among the monks and doesn't want to be a soldier anymore . Needless to say , when the guys with the stripes on their shoulders approach and ask for his help , he's uninterested until a mission goes forward in Afghanistan and results in the good guy from the second movie getting taken prisoner , the first American ever taken prisoner in Afghanistan . And here , just like the last movie , is where everything starts to fall apart . The first American ever captured in Afghanistan is not an enviable position , to be sure , so it's easy to understand why Rambo would make such a sudden change of heart . What is unfortunately missing is the entire rest of the American military . I'm curious about how the real members of the United States military responded to the movie , which portrays them as either helpless or completely absent . It may be , perhaps , that the mission is thought to be a lost cause or not worth the risk , so sending Rambo in must , of course , be done " unofficially . " If Rambo is caught , he is told prior to embarking on the mission , the military will deny all knowledge of his existence , which prompts Rambo to sneer and say he's used to such treatment , and then do that thing where he ties his headband on all dramatically . At any rate , it's no surprise when Rambo insists that he has to do everything on his own . If you saw the level of sheer camp that the second movie reached then you know something of what to expect here , although it should be said that Rambo III is certainly better than First Blood Part II , which is undeniably the worst film of the already unimpressive series . It is definitely interesting , however , to watch the way the Afghani people are portrayed in the movie . Rambo enters Afghanistan alone and has to make his way to where the prisoner is being kept with only a single in-country contact , who tells him all about the cultural realities on the ground for the Afghani people . Alexander the Great tried and failed to conquer the Afghans , then the British , then the Americans , and they all failed . He explains to Rambo and ancient battle prayer written by a long-since defeated enemy - " May God deliver us from the venom of the cobra , the teeth of the tiger , and the vengeance of the Afghan . " The relationship between America and Afghanistan has changed drastically over the years , and not in a good way . In fact , given that we're at war in Afghanistan right now , this movie appears strangely prophetic . If George W . Bush had re-watched Rambo III somewhere around early 2003 , it would not be a stretch to think that the situation in the middle east might be drastically different right now . " Every day your war machines lose ground to a bunch of poorly armed , poorly equipped freedom fighters . The fact is you underestimated your competition . If you'd studied your history you would know that these people have never given up to anyone . They'd rather die than be slaves to an invading army . You can't defeat a people like that ! " Believe it or not , this is not a scathing criticism of America's current war in Afghanistan , it's a scathing criticism by the American prisoner of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in the movie . It is one of the movie's strangest qualities that it pitts the Americans and the Afghans as allies against the cartoonishly villainous Soviets , who come in the form of wild-eyed lunatics at the controls of attack helicopters that buzz small villages laying waste unprovoked to whole populations of peaceful civilians . They are not just an invading force , they are airborne murderers that bombs women and children and disguise bombs as toys to trick unsuspecting children . With such enemies , it is understandable when one character ominously says , " God would have mercy , Rambo won't . . . " as Rambo sets off on his preposterous one-man mission of vengeance against the invading Soviets . It's interesting that the movie makes so much of how the Afghans have never given in to any invading force in their long history , and yet now they need Rambo to come in and save them from the Russians , but no matter . The movie was made to give the world another dose of outlandish Rambo-style retribution directed at the evil forces that be , and that's what it delivers . It's just too bad that Rambo-style retribution is generally so head-smackingly dumb .
544867	562732	133152	5.0	Planet of the Oops !	I'm not entirely familiar with all of the other Planet of the Apes films , but I don't think there could be anything in any of them that would change my mind about the 2001 version . We start off with an electrical storm in space that results in some serious time travel , just like we saw in Lost In Space , which results in our hero winding up thousands of years in the future and on an unknown planet . Seconds after surviving the crash landing of his pod on this mysterious planet , Leo Davidson ( Mark Walhberg ) finds himself surrounded by fleeing HUMANS . The first thing I thought was that there are humans and apes on an unknown planet in an unknown galaxy roughly 5000 years in the future , but later we learn ( also as seen in Lost In Space ) that Leo's ship also passed through that time warp and landed in the same place , leaving the humans to go into submission to the out-of-control apes that were on the ship for experimentation , and the apes themselves were left to evolve and take control , ultimately turning into the hard-nosed apes that ruled the planet when Leo crash landed . That was a mouthful . Pretty creative though , once we are eventually informed as to what the hell is going on . So Leo is stuck on this planet where the roles are basically reversed and exaggerated between humans and apes , and now it is entirely up to Leo to save this planet's version of the human race from the oppression of the apes . Tim Roth delivers a horribly annoying performance as General Thade , the militant leader of the apes who is so filled with hatred for the humans ( for reasons never made entirely clear ) that he operates just like a machine . He's always grunting and growling and always has his head tilted downward like he's expecting physical confrontation at all times , and his constant guttural tone of voice makes him almost amusing after a while . One of the biggest problems with this movie is that the apes are so well made up , but they also have tremendous intelligence , as is made evident by their strikingly human eyes , and yet they switch back and forth from normal speech to the same screeching and screaming that you hear from the monkeys at the zoo . There is a scene where General Thade is told that the humans crossed the river using the apes ' own horses , and he jumps all around the place , screeching and jumping and breaking things , and then he's back on the ground talking like a warrior . It's so hard to take this stuff seriously . Helena Bonham Carter is excellent as Ari , the weirdly attractive ape who is disgruntled with the way that the humans are treated by the apes , and who turns against her own kind to help the humans escape . There is a childish scene at the end of the film where Leo kisses Ari that is sure to get a laugh from any audience , while the stunningly but almost weirdly beautiful Estella Warren provides the human love interest . It's a good thing that they had a human woman in this movie to take romantic interest in Leo , because without her we only have Ari , who is 100 % ape but who acts exactly like a human woman while interacting with Leo . For the first half of the film , I was a little nervous about the possibility of a little bestiality happening somewhere in there . So we know that Ari is helping the humans because she is disillusioned with her violent species , but they are also accompanied by another ape - Attar , I think ( hey , half the fun was trying to figure out who was underneath all that make-up , right ? ) - and we never know why he agrees to go along , knowing that he will face severe punishment upon returning , which is one of the movies more simplistic but peeving oversights . It is , however , the ending of the film that ruins it beyond all hope for being saved . At the beginning of the film , when Leo took off in the pod toward the electrical storm , he was going after the pod of his chimp , with whom all communication had been lost . He gets swept away in the same electrical storm as the chimp got caught in , and winds up on the planet described above . At the end of the film , the chimp comes through right in the middle of the climactic battle between the humans and the apes , and the apes bow down to him as their god . This was actually a pretty clever scene , because he was , in fact , one of the first apes of their civilization , and then Leo trades places with him , leaving him with Ari ( and with an obviously broken leg , which we're left to assume turned out okay ) and taking the ship back to his own time . And General Thade , I guess , was just left sulking under that console on the ship forever , doomed to live the rest of his life as a loose end in a sub-par sci fi movie . It was bad enough that everything on the ship still worked after thousands of years , now they have to leave stuff everywhere unexplained . So we get back to Earth , Leo survives the entrance through the atmosphere and then miraculously survives another violent crash landing without a scratch , and he finds the Lincoln Monument is an ape ( when I saw Lincoln from behind , I jokingly said to myself that it would be an ape . I was disappointed and amused to find that I was right ) . This could , of course , mean only one thing . Seeing how there was barely an explanation for the English speaking humans and apes on the planet on which most of the film took place , and there was literally none at all given for the apes replacing the humans on Earth , we can only assume that they ran out of money or they are just setting up for a sequel . My money is on the latter . Stay tuned for part 9 ( or so ) .
544572	562732	261392	5.0	The Return of the Jay and Silent Bob Do America .	The only consistently amusing characters from Kevin Smith's films ( films which are not , by any stretch of the imagination , immune to coming out as total garbage ) return to the big screen to inspire great big laughs because the film is able to laugh at itself , which is very important with comedies like this . The plot bears striking resemblance to the hilarious Beavis & Butt-Head Do America , but this doesn't take away from the film as a whole or make it seem redundant or even unoriginal because the plot is actually a very small part of the film . It is no secret that Jay and Silent Bob are the reason that we keep getting treated to more films from Kevin Smith ( you think he would have gotten any corporate sponsors after that mess Chasing Amy if it weren't for them ? ) , so it's nice that they finally decided to dedicate an entire film to them . The movie as a whole is composed of a series of dirty jokes and a goofball plot that is squashed into obscurity under the hilarious presence of Jay and his famous silent sidekick . Sadly , this is virtually the only thing that the film has going for it . On the nother hand , it's unfortunately ironic that the very thing that made this movie interesting is also the most disappointing part of it - the casting . Obviously , Jay and Silent Bob could never be played by anyone else , but the casting director seems to have gone a little bit overboard with more than a couple of the cameos . I loved seeing James Van der Beek and that idiot Jason Biggs , I thought they both played great roles in this movie ( probably because they were making fun of themselves during most of their screen time ) . These are some of the most recognizable of the recent proliferation of actors who can't act and who have made it into Hollywood by some mysterious manipulation of reality . Van der Beek I can't explain , but I imagine Biggs was found because he was hired to play a part in what could not have been thought to be more than a goofy b-movie comedy , American Pie , and it turned out to be a huge hit , so the producers erroneously thought that he was suddenly a huge star . Whoops . Then you have a great cameo from Matt Damon and Ben Affleck . Yeah , these guys proved themselves with Good Will Hunting , which was so good that Affleck can even be forgiven for the ridiculous Armageddon . The best part of Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back , the way that it pokes fun at Hollywood , comes especially into play into this cameo , as we are treated to a scene from the sequel to Good Will Hunting ( ' Applesauce ! ' ) . Carrie Fisher plays an unenviable role as the nun who picks Jay and Silent Bob when an unfortunate turn of events leaves them stuck as hitchhikers . Seann William Scott , the real comedic source that made movies like American Pie and Road Trip at least slightly amusing , is completely wasted in a role that makes no sense to have him in . He plays a hopeless geek who happens to be traveling with a bunch of hotties ( as Roger Ebert would say , no prizes for guessing why he took the role ) , and there is no reason for him to be in this role other than to put him in the preview and make people think that he will actually do something funny in it , and we are totally disappointed . He is literally thrown out of a moving van and out of the movie before anything even happens . However , it is poor Mark Hamill who is really to be felt sorry for after watching this movie . It is clear from the minute you hear the title that there is going to be some serious Star Wars bashing going on here , but the best spoofs are the ones that make fun of films themselves , not the deflated state of the old stars ( if you want to see a brilliant Star Wars spoof , watch Spaceballs ) . Poor Mark Hamill was one of the main stars of the most successful science fiction series of all time , and a couple decades later he's stuck playing a character called ' Cock-knocker ' in a goofball comedy with virtually no redeeming values . They even had to put up a huge title card to make sure that people notice that the poor guy underneath all that ridiculous make-up is the fallen sci fi hero . Kevin Smith has NOT earned enough respect to justify smacking Star Wars like that . Jay and Silent Bob is not a movie that is going to be remembered as a great comedy . It's a huge success because the characters have become so famous with junior high school and high school kids all over the world , but there is no content in the film . It fits snugly among movies like the Scary Movies and American Pie and Road Trip and Dude , Where's My Car ? With some effort , some amusement and possibly an occasional nervous laugh can be derived from these slopfests ( okay , not the Scary Movies , but the rest had their moments ) , so luckily Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back is one of the better films in this ludicrous category ( thanks in no small part to the wonderful contribution from Ben Affleck and Matt Damon ) , but the film is likely to be reduced to bottom shelf oblivion faster than you can say , ' For God's sake , Kevin , no more ! '
544297	562732	55830	5.0	Classic horror , but badly dated .	Carnival of Souls is the kind of title for a movie that really makes you want it to be scary . It's such a good name , especially for this genre , but this version has lost most if not all of its effectiveness since its release in 1962 . The story is about a girl who manages to survive a car crash , and subsequently cuts herself off from other people , taking a job as an organ player at a church , but just as a way to make money . She begins to have creepy visions of a dead looking man who constantly shows up at strange times , and eventually seems to be following her . While the main character , Candace Hilligoss , is surprisingly attractive , the entire film is full of bad acting and even worse script writing . She meets a guy in the home where she is renting a room , and although he is overly insistent , he is always polite to her . Then when she eventually agrees to go out on a date with him , he almost immediately turns into a complete bd . Why would he go to all of that effort to persuade her to spend time with him , and then treat her like crap ? The ghostly visions that she has , in particular , have lost all of their effect . Toward the end of the film , not only does she see dozens of these zombies following her , but she also sees herself as one , which hints to the possibility that this movie might have some meaning beyond just a goofy ghost story . However , probably the main reason that this movie isn't scary is that a lot of the scenes weren't edited very well . There's a scene when Mary ( Hilligoss ) is running from dozens of the zombies , and you can clearly see a huge grin on her face , as if the zombies were a huge group of children who were trying to tickle her . While Carnival of Souls does have a few fairly creepy moments , the film as a whole is a disappointment . The black and white photography is probably one of the best elements of the film , and it does have an interesting soundtrack , but the movie almost entirely lost its impact over the years . And the obscure and confusing ending didn't help much either ?
544295	562732	118842	5.0	Kevin Smith's worst movie ever .	( spoilers ) Jason Lee was , by far , the funniest guy in this movie ( followed VERY closely by the small part with Silent Bob and especially Jay ) , as was the case in Mallrats and would have been the case in Clerks , had he been in that movie . Unfortunately , his comedic potential was muted and replaced by intense ( although also fairly amusing , at times ) anger . His high volume obnoxiousness in public places is just as amusing as ever , but the numbing profanity that dominates the majority of his conversations with Holden , his partner in comic book making , is not only not funny but also overly excessive . While the film as a whole is a disappointment ( despite the ending , which almost saved it ) , there were some interesting things in it . Just after Banky ( Lee ) and Holden ( Ben Affleck ) discover Alyssa's sexual orientation , there is a hilarious scene in a bar in which Banky asks Alyssa questions about lesbianism , how two girls can fck , for example . Ben Affleck plays the part of the typical male , who wants to immediately cut off contact with her because he is upset about the fact that she is a lesbian . Nevertheless , he ends up falling in love with her , and while the ensuing love triangle was interesting enough , there was just too much stuff in this movie that was horribly aggravating . And by ' horribly aggravating , ' of course , I mean three things - Joey , Lauren , and Adams . Her nasally performance as the confused Alyssa was mildly annoying at first , as she goofily grinned her way through the first part of the film . This part of the film , which contained the mildly annoying part of her performance , was topped off when she uttered the cheesiest line in the entire movie - ' I'm so in love ! ' Maybe it was just the stupid way that she said it that made it sound so ridiculous . Then , of course , we have the screaming scenes . Hearing Alyssa scream at Holden at the top of her lungs was beyond annoying - this grated on the nerves like a thousand fingers on a thousand chalkboards . And not only was it almost painful to listen to her yell like that , but it just seemed to go on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on . Ben Affleck spends the majority of the film pied off , and Jason Lee's comedy skills are tragically under-used because he spends the majority of the film pied off at Holden for even caring about Alyssa , who he calls a ' man hating dyke . ' Fortunately , he often can't help being funny , but Chasing Amy is barely a comedy . This is a twisted romance that is punctuated with explicit profanity and dozens of sexual innuendos , which had a lot of star power but ended up inconclusive anyway . Thank God Jay and Silent Bob showed up , because it's really not until that point in the movie that you really sit up and care about what's about to happen . To make matters worse , Alyssa is constantly spouting pseudo-philosophical nonsense about life - why she's gay , why she chose to make an exception for Holden , etc . While some of it makes sense , trying to find the right person , no matter what their sex , this kind of stuff , especially utilized to such an extent , just doesn't belong in what could have been a great comedy . One thing in Chasing Amy that was fairly interesting ( probably as a result of such a lack of interesting content ) , is its allusions to other films . At east I hope that it's alluding to other films , because if not , then there is some blatant plagiarism here . Of course , there are references to previous Kevin Smith films , both in the comic strip opening sequence as well as at the end when Jay and Silent Bob show up ( ' What took you guys so long , were you at the mall again ? ' ) , but I'm talking about at least one stolen line , and from Jaws , of all places . There is a scene where Banky and Alyssa are comparing cunnilingus scars , and besides the fact that the entire scene can be found in the exact same form in numerous films - such as Lethal Weapon III and , of course , Jaws - there is a point where Alyssa says ( of the scar that Banky had just shown her ) ' I got that beat . I got that beat . ' You remember this as the exact same line spoken by Richard Dreyfuss to Quint , as they were also comparing scars on that boat while they waited for the shark to show up . Needless to say , the quick cameo from Jay and silent Bob was the best part of this movie , and also watch for Matt Damon in an extremely small part . Despite the more well known actors , Chasing Amy doesn't even live up to the modest standards of the two Kevin Smith films that preceded it , both of which were hilarious but plagued with horrendously awful acting . If you're a huge Kevin Smith fan , you may want to watch Chasing Amy , but if not , you may want to steer clear . Either way , though , you're probably headed for bitter disappointment .
544326	562732	1228933	6.0	Back to basics of a whole new kind . . .	My first reaction to the first few minutes of Laid to Rest was that it was a cheap , no-budget horror film typical of the direct-to-video nonsense that you so often see populating the new release wall at the video store . Well , that I remember seeing on the new release wall at the video store , anyway . It's been a couple yeas since I've lived in the states and even longer since Netflix left me with any reason to ever visit a video store , but back in 2004 or so I used to have that monthly no-limit rental service at both Blockbuster and Hollywood Video and for a brief period I tried to keep up with ALL of the new movies , which included this horizonless stream of train wrecks that seemed to come out of nowhere . And in many ways , that's what Laid to Rest is , but in some interesting other ways , it's not . Yeah it's true that the story is a prime example of mind-numbing pointlessness , but it would be a mistake to relegate the thing to the dark world of bottom shelf obscurity . Sort of . You see , there's not a scrap of originality or significance to the movie , but it is a perfect example of something bigger that is happening around us in the movie world at large . 80 years ago , movie-going audiences would have been shocked out of their chairs to see a man and a woman kiss on screen . Hell , 50 years ago they were still pretty uncomfortable with it . 10 years ago , even the most brutally violent horror movies more often than not showed the KILLER during the kill scenes , as movie blood sprayed all over them . Then Scream came along ( by the way , true story ? just this second I mis-typed " Scream " and it accidentally came out " Scarem . " Interesting . ) and we saw the hugely famous Drew Barrymore get stabbed in the chest in the opening scene . No cutaway or anything , remember that ? The movie briefly goes into slow motion and audiences the world over were shocked that we were actually looking at this knife going into this girl's chest . I'd been watching scary movies for years by that point and even I was pretty amazed . Strangely , to this day it is still a scene that makes me a little uncomfortable . Now , on the other hand , such a thing is as tame as those monster movies that had people jumping out of their chairs in the 1950s , so we get movies like Laid to Rest which , if you were to show it to some of those audiences , would probably flood the theaters with heart attack victims . There is no cutting away here , man . Not by a long shot and it's going to be a pretty good idea for you to be well aware of that before you start watching it . Such a movie could never be released in wide theatrical release , you understand , but that's the huge shift that's taking place in the movie world right now . Making movies is getting easier , nearly to the point where any jerk with a camera and a computer can get a movie made as long as he can find someone to distribute it . Of course , it's to be expected that these movies are almost uniformly awful , and Laid to Rest is a prime example . It's pretty bad , but these things are getting better and they're only going to continue to get better as people learn to make better and better movies with simpler equipment , at which point the direct-to - video market will grow and improve , and the important thing is that all of this will happen beyond the grasp of the censorship-happy MPAA . The result , of course , is that we get movies like Laid to Rest which feature nothing but the grotesque developments of pushing the violence envelope , which is really all that this movie does . Like literally . The movie has absolutely nothing to it except violence , which is why all this stuff about the MPAA came to my mind . There is no backstory to the killer in the movie whatsoever , or really any backstory to the story itself . Some big-breasted brunette wakes up in a closed casket , no idea who she is or why she's there . She manages to knock the thing over and escape , but before she gets out of the funeral home she witnesses a man wearing a chrome skull mask brutally kill another man , and then the killer comes after her . Why does he want to kill her ? Who knows ? Who cares ? Any explanation would just waste time . We understand that this is a slasher movie , and this particular slasher movie has no interest in such time-wasting things as character depth or coherent story structure . The important thing is that for the rest of the movie he relentlessly pursues her , viciously killing anyone who gets in his way with a serrated , double-edged knife . Gore hounds will be highly impressed , as the movie is astonishingly and graphically bloody . We get sustained shots of the killer sawing away at various body parts , and one scene where we the central cast pops the lids off of a succession of coffins , revealing some of the killer's past kills , which he has taken the time to save , for future reference , let's say . I won't go into any details about the state of the victims in the coffins , let's just say that they are one of many reasons that the movie is not for the faint of heart , or the squeamish , or really anyone who , for example , would feel some hesitation at taking up the opportunity to do a little dissecting work on a human cadaver . But the rest of you are going to love it ?
544870	562732	116514	6.0	Not quite as good as part III , but Bloodline is still a relatively watchable installment in the hugely successful Hellraiser series .	The year is 2127 , and a descendent of the maker of the box that opens the gate to Hell is trying to figure out a way to open the box and trap the demons that come out of Hell . He has commandeered a space station ( that he himself designed ) for this task . He opens the box , lets the demons out , and is detained ( people begin to investigate his questionable behavior on the ship ) before he can capture them . Almost the entire film is told in the form of a story which he tells the people holding him , in an effort to get them to let him go so he can finish his work . Needless to say , it takes a lot of gory deaths to convince them . There is a small bit of tension created by the fact that the entire time he is telling the guards what is going on , the Cenobites are out and are on the ship . However , this is largely forgotten about for the majority of the film because so much of it takes place in 18th century France , the time when the box was created . Basically , some toymaker makes the box , opens it , demons show up , and they terrorize his family for generations . You'd think they'd be grateful because he let them out into the world of the living . Anyway , the guy in 2127 has taken upon himself the task of building a NEW box that will be sort of an antidote to the first box , one that is designed so that it can actually trap LIGHT inside . It's an interesting enough story , and it was actually fairly entertaining , but the film itself was still somewhat lacking . The acting was pretty bad ( but at least Ashley Laurence was blissfully absent again ) , and there wasn't much effort put into the directing . The movement back and forth from the distant future to the distant past was also a bit detrimental at times to the tension of the story , but luckily the film did present a few cool new cenobites ( one that was satisfactorily created out of a couple of idiot security guards ) , and Bloodline also displayed probably one of Pinhead's best performances ever . I would say that Bloodline is more of an informational movie than a good Hellraiser movie . While it is interesting to watch , it is almost more informational than entertaining . So even though the movie itself may have been disappointing , I think that it is a good addition to the series as a whole . It works better within the Hellraiser series than it does by itself .
544633	562732	120784	6.0	Payback is a good action movie but that's about all .	Mel Gibson has been so heavily typecast as the good guy that even in a movie for which the tagline is ' Get ready to root for the bad guy , ' he's not the bad guy . Quite the contrary , a premise like this is little more than a way to get people to expect a heightened level of blood and violence in the movie , it gives the special effects people an excuse to do creative things with ball hammers and to make the audience find even the most brutal murders to be ' quite fun and funny , ' as one IMDb reviewer put it . For some reason , however , I wasn't entirely amused to see a guy get shot in the shoulder and then the knee , and when he fails to produce a lighter when asked for a light , he gets a pillow pressed over his face and gets shot in the forehead . Granted , this was a very bad guy and had double crossed Porter ( Mel Gibson , the GOOD guy ) in one of the worst ways imaginable , and there is nothing that you want more than to see this guy fall , but that certainly doesn't make it amusing or even cheerful . I weep for the obvious descent of mankind into barbarism if people laughed at this . Let's consider the plot here . Mel Gibson is a criminal , and a good one at that . He and his wife are involved in crime that involves high risk and massive payoffs , and when one score results in the acquisition of $130 , 000 , he and she and their partner , Val ( Gregg Henry ) begin discussing the splitting of the money . Porter calmly says that they will split it like they agreed in the first place , even though it turned out to be less than they expected , and Val and Lynn ( Porter's wife ) turn on Porter , shooting him in the back , taking all the money for themselves to run away together , and leaving him for dead . Five months later , Porter is recovered again and is out to get his money by whatever means necessary . The important thing here is that he is obviously so disappointed when he is forced to use violence that his shoulders droop to let us know that it's the last thing in the world that he wants , and on top of that , he wants $70 , 000 , not $130 , 000 . All he wants is his share , even after all he's been through . So how's he the bad guy again ? Under the circumstances , it's amazing how obvious it is that presenting Porter as the bad guy is a weak ploy to get more violence into the movie , and it is a terrible sign of the state of our society that people enjoyed this . Try watching a movie like Payback and then watch Michael Moore's brilliant documentary Bowling for Columbine , you won't be so eager to root for the ' bad guy ' after all . On the one hand , Payback is a quality action film with plenty of car crashes and guns and killing and death , all the necessary ingredients for an action film these days , but the premise is such a weak scheme that it drastically lowers the rest of the movie . Lucy Liu , however , can be seen in a relatively early role looking sexier than anyone should really be allowed to look in a movie . I was almost depressed when it was over , she looked so good . I do not want to give the impression that Payback was a bad film or that I completely condemn it for it's ploy to get as much violence as possible into it , I just think that it could have been a much better movie if they hadn't laid so much emphasis on its violent content . Even the obligatory action movie hottie only added to the enjoyment of it all ( I'm sure female viewers felt the same , of course ) , so it is certainly a movie that is likely to be enjoyed by action fans . The rest of you , however , may want to be a little more careful . The violence , at least at one point , is literally stomach-turning .
544868	562732	95294	6.0	Picking up almost exactly where part I left off , Hellraiser II , although also not a great movie in any respect , continues the unlikely but strangely fascinating story started by the original Hellraiser in 19	Hellraiser II , like the rest of the series , requires an extreme suspension of disbelief . Obviously , horror movies are not meant to portray reality , but there was not a single solitary piece of the real world presented here . Not for even one second of film time did anything resembling real life show up in the movie , and this took a lot away from the film's potential . Think about how much more effective the film would have been had Kirsty Cotton ( Ashley Laurence , in her second ridiculous performance in this series alone ) been kept in a psychiatric hospital that even remotely resembled even the most dismal hospital in the real world . I would have been much more interested had she been placed in an atmosphere of normality , beyond which she knows the hellish creatures that are the Cenobites lurk . I mean , a hospital that doesn't seem to have electricity , that has a violent ward that looks more like a medieval torture chamber , and that allows patients to roam the halls doesn't do justice to the film's personality . What this type of thing does is give the entire film a creepy mood , and takes away from the effectiveness of the parts of the film that are really meant to be scary . There just wasn't much creativity in the movie's presentation . Kirsty , a PATIENT in the hospital , wanders down the darkened hall one evening , and she comes upon the room of Tiffany who , as Kirsty's doctor explains to her after finding her ( rather than taking her back to her own room ) , is a complete mystery because she never speaks . She just sits around and solves puzzles ( like little wooden boxes ! ! Kirsty didn't seem bothered by that little detail ? ) . Also , did anybody ever figure out why the hell she touched the blood from her wall ( ' ? I am in Hell help me ? ' ) to her LIPS ? ! Maybe she really does belong in the psych ward . Hellraiser II goes more in depth into some of the things that were presented in part I . For example , the film starts off with a quick scene showing Pinhead's creation , and the film also takes the audience into the world of the Cenobites . It gives an idea of where they come from and how they are made . It is this element of the film that saves it from absolute failure . The script was awful ( ' You have got to destroy that mattress ! You have GOT to destroy that mattress ! ! ' Or how about this , my favorite , ' Kyle , when I think , I hurt . ' That's brilliant , Kirsty ) , the atmosphere was entirely overdone , and the directing was unimaginative and routine . Kirsty and Kyle , her ? doctor , ' momentarily develop a hint of a ridiculous romance , and the film was packed with careless mistakes ( like the fact that , after Julia eats enough women to get her skin back , Dr . Channard cuts her bandages off and she has MAKEUP on . I guess it must have come with the skin ? ) . Then there were trivial things like when Ashley and Tiffany ( whose real name we never learn ) , barely escape one of those Hell tunnels into a room and there are two beams of light showing on the wall , having come through the window . What's this , two suns ? At any rate , the movie itself was clumsily put together , but luckily it went into detail about the things that made the equally poor original so successful . The Cenobites , ironically enough , are given a more human side , and even the thoroughly evil Pinhead shows a bit of compassion at the end of the film ( a lot of good it does him ? ) . The best element of Hellraiser II , like part I , was the convincing makeup done on the skinless people . There were some intricate details there , and the desired gross-out reaction is pretty successfully attained . Some scenes were actually painful to watch ( remember that poor nutcase who tried to get the maggots off himself with the straight razor ? ) , which I think is a mark of at least limited success for this type of horror film . If you are a horror fan , the entire Hellraiser series is obviously mandatory viewing , but I think that other people , before you immediately dismiss the Hellraiser films as complete wastes of time , should realize that they are not meant to be mainstream films . These are made for people who are into this kind of splatter film , and as a splatter film it succeeds on many levels . It creates fascinating characters ( the Cenobites , not the numbingly boring humans ) , tells an unlikely but interesting story about their interaction with the living world , and never fails to throw in buckets and buckets of blood and gore . I'm a pretty devoted horror fan myself , but even though I regard Pinhead as the best villain ever created in film , Hellraiser II ( as well as the rest of them ) was so flawed that I cannot hail this as a great or even a really good film . It's good horror and it's fun to watch , but it probably won't go down in history as a classic horror movie .
543966	562732	69897	6.0	What the hell does ' blaxploitation ' mean ?	I imagine it has something to do with the weak script and plot that Coffy has , but this movie doesn't exactly exploit African Americans any more than a sex thriller like Poison Ivy or something exploits white people . Coffy isn't really that bad of a movie if you can look past the same old revenge plot and the fact that , while she's not bustin ' some hoodlum ass , Coffy is some sort of nurse in her spare time . This woman is like the black female version of Rambo , but the film doesn't really take itself seriously enough for this to be a problem . Coffy is a tough black woman who decides to take matters into her own hands when the law proves powerless to help catch the drug dealers who turned her little sister into a drugged out vegetable . To make matter's worse , a friend of Coffy's named Carter , a police officer , gets beaten ( in a pathetic fight scene ) and suffers brain damage , further enraging Coffy . The whole movie is about drugs and violence , and Coffy pretends to be Mr . George's newest ho so that she can get close to her enemies and bring them down from the inside . Mr . George , by the way , is a hilariously stereotypical 70s pimp , with his felt hat , ridiculous glasses , and matching pastel outfit that is so tight that he sports a cameltoe . While at a party with Mr . George , Coffy contaminates his drug supply , replacing his cocaine stash with sugar . This is the party where that classic cat-fight scene takes place , with Coffy getting into a side-splitting scuffle with all the rest of Mr . George's harem , and having committed the laughable idea of booby-trapping her hair with razor blades . Okay , now we're really getting to know how much this movie takes itself seriously . And I won't even mention the monstrous lesbian girlfriend of Priscilla , the character that was introduced just before the most idiotic fight scene in the entire film . And then there was the car chase near the end of the film in which the cop drives like a Duke of Hazzard for no apparent reason . While the movie is filled with crap like this and is therefore a definitive B-movie , there were some relatively interesting things going on . For example , it was actually pretty clever the way that Coffy was able to turn the drug dealers against each other so that she didn't have to do all of the killing herself . Also , while all of the fight scenes were awful , some of the violence was surprisingly , and often disturbingly , convincing . When George is dragged to death behind the car , for example , it was obviously a dummy being dragged but the fact that hate-crimes like this have been so notoriously committed against blacks , the emotional impact made it much more effective . Maybe that's what blaxploitation is referring to . The standard revenge plot is not given much of a twist in Coffy , and the closing scene with her walking alone on a beach at sunset doesn't really fit with the rest of the movie . There is some pretty funny dialogue , though . White Zombie fans are sure to recognize her quote early in the film just before she un-heads some drug dealer with a shotgun ( ' This is the end of your rotten life you mother-FCKIN'-dope pusher ! ' ) . BLAM ! ! Yeah Coffy ! And then at the end , some guy begs for his life while in a swimming pool while Coffy points a shotgun at him , and she says , ' Sheeeit , I ain't gonna kill you . ' BLAM ! ! Yeah Coffy ! It's no secret that this is not Oscar material . It's a cheesy action film with bad acting and a recycled story , but if you keep that in mind when you watch it , it's actually enjoyable , at least on a few meager levels . Maxim magazine lists Coffy as number 7 on its list of the 50 best B-movies of all time , and there can clearly be no mistake about its status as a B-movie . Enjoy , but be aware of the movie's limitations .
544564	562732	87298	6.0	The most star-studded one so far !	The above statement is relative , of course , but whenever I watch old movies like these , I always watch for actors who later went on to more visible careers . I guess it would be more accurate to call this the most star-studded Friday since part 1 , since Kevin Bacon's later career probably overshadows all of the semi-famous actors in this movie combined . There are some interesting connections , however . Watch for Judie Aronson , for example , who later became hugely famous for her role as Hilly in Weird Science ( in which she plays the girlfriend of Robert Rusler , who you might remember getting slashed up by Freddy in Nightmare on Elm Street 2 ) , Corey Feldman also has a pretty significant part in this film , although he looks about half the size as he did in The Goonies , which was released the year after this movie . And of course , my favorite , Crispin Glover , who later went on to costar in the massive Back to the Future trilogy , as well as the only interesting role in either of the Charlie's Angels movies . I loved his role in this movie because it fits his later iconography so well ( maybe it even caused it ) ? he's kind of the geeky guy who gets shunned by the girls and , in one of the greatest scenes in the movie , demonstrates the reason for that when he dances . WOW . At this point in the series it begins to become increasingly clear that each movie is something of a rehash of the same plot and ideas ( not that you would expect anything hugely different from a series like this ) , especially because the movie starts off with ten minutes or so of review from the last movies , as one of the characters from Part 2 tells a story around a campfire to the latest group of Jason fodder about what happened in the last three movies . Basically you see all of the grisly murders as this guy describes them , reminding returning fans of what happened in the last three movies and informing people who jumped right to the final chapter of what Jason's all about . Sort of catches you all up without even having to watch the other three movies . It's an interesting setup this time , with a lot of kids renting out a cabin next door to a family who lives there permanently ( Feldman plays the young son in this family , fascinated by the promiscuous antics of the new college kids next door ) . The basic message of each film having a lot of teenagers making out and getting naked and subsequently getting killed seems to take on a little bit more meaning in this movie as little Tommy ( Feldman ) gawks intently and wide-eyed at a girl undressing in the other house until his mother comes in and closes the curtains . Even though it's still pretty muted by the abundant killing and gore , it seems that the teens who have sex and go skinny dipping and whatnot are getting killed not only because Jason originally drowned because the people who were supposed to be watching him were making out at the time , but also because of the effect that their carelessness could have on kids like Tommy . Could it be that the Friday the 13th movies actually have a positive message ? It seems even more apparent that that might be the case when you examine the target audience . I wasn't watching movies like this when they originally were released ( since I was 5 years old at the time ) , but they're clearly geared toward teenagers much like the ones in the movies , out to have a good time with all their friends on a Friday night , and what better way than for everyone to go to a scary movie so the girls get scared and cling onto the guys ? That's a pretty big goal for just about every teenage guy , to get girls to cling to him , and while I doubt the movies had much of an effect in getting them to say ' You know , maybe we should wait until we're married ' or something , it's still a pretty cleverly subtle message . On a aesthetic level , the film has made a huge jump from part 3 . I think that for the rest of the series , there is never again as sudden and significant an improvement on the actual film quality , which seems to have been shot on genuine film , while the earlier films look like they were recorded almost with videotape on a home movie camera . The quality of the picture is much better , and there is even an extension on Jason's personality , even though I think in the end it works against the effect of the movie as a whole . In this installment , Jason does a lot of things to reveal his murders and scare his future victims at the same time . One of the bodies is nailed to a doorway ( leading to the gut wrenching necessity of it later being ripped off ) , throws a girl through a window like a baseball , plants a body in a closet so that it will tip out when one of the kids opens it , etc . It's actually pretty amusing to picture Jason doing this , and the fact that he actually breaks into a run in this movie increases the level of campiness almost to the breaking point . There's plenty of unnecessary nudity to keep the guys happy ( even some male nudity thrown in there for the girls ) and lots of brutal killings in keeping with what the movies are all about . I was actually pretty impressed with this installment , but mostly for things like that actual aesthetic quality of the film itself , the performances from so many actors that I recognized from later movies , the difference in the way that Jason acted ( even though the actor playing Jason , Ted White , had his name removed from the film because he wasn't proud of his performance ) , and the fact that the movie actually had some originality thrown in for good measure rather than just having a lot of teens go up to the lake to be rebellious and end up getting killed . The addition of a neighboring family with a young son ( who ended up playing such a significant role that he stays on even for a couple more movies ) was a nice touch , and while the killings were pretty much going through the motions , the movie marks a turn away from the rather rigid plotline seen in various forms the first three movies . Not a classic , and certainly not the final chapter , but this is one of the more entertaining and clever of the Friday the 13th movies .
543761	562732	95882	6.0	It's no James Bond , but still good , clean , dumb fun .	Okay , so something happens in the first few minutes of Police Academy 5 that must surely be the most meaningful and artistic bit of creative story-telling that has happened before or since in the entire series . As Captain Harris and Proctor are breaking into Chief Hurst's office to get their hands on his files , Proctor worries that they're breaking the law . " We're not breaking the law , Proctor , " Harris assures him . " We are STRETCHING it . " After he says this we cut to Proctor , who pulls on a piece of bubble gum between his fingers which stretches ? and then breaks . In a rare moment of thoughtfulness , Proctor appeared to me to look at the gum and discover the stretching and breaking are pretty much the same thing . At any rate , it's telling that such a simple thing should come across as one of the most creatively meaningful things in the series , but I do have to say that Police Academy 5 is not nearly as bad as I have read that it is . In fact , I would go so far as to say that it's one of the better sequels in the whole bonehead franchise . In his search , Harris has discovered that Lassard has reached the state's mandatory retirement age and thus sets about on a mission to force him into retirement so that he can take over the job himself . The only problem , of course , is that Harris still doesn't command a scrap of respect from anyone in sight , while Lassard lovingly oversees his academy like a clueless grandfather . You see , he is so good at obtaining the respect of his men through the timely feeding of his ever-present goldfish that he has earned himself the coveted " Police Officer of the Decade " award ( normally I would think that such an award would go to an actual police officer , but that's just me ) . So a ceremony is scheduled to be held in his honor in beautiful Miama Beach , so the whole Police Academy Crew packs up and heads on down to the sunny south for the festivities . Harris , of course , employs Proctor's considerable wisdom and skill to book them two first class tickets to Miami , and the two end up traveling on a rickety plane full of farm animals with loose bowels . The crime this time is a group of astonishingly stupid diamond thieves , who manage to pull off a brilliant diamond heist and get away without a trace , but can't make it through an airport without tripping all over themselves and accidentally swapping their diamond-laden bag with Lassard's goldfish-laden bag . You have your small-time crime boss with the slicked back hair and quick tongue , and his two meathead sidekicks who hop along behind him going " whatever you say boss " and " boss are you okay boss ? " If only they had taken these bumbling morons down a notch or two , they could easily have been the funniest thing in the whole movie . The rest of the movie follows the diamond thieves as they try to get their diamonds back before the real crime boss kills them all , and before Lassard figures out that that video camera that he's using isn't a present from the guys but the hiding spot for the stolen diamonds . As you know , this is the first Police Academy movie that's missing Steve Guttenberg as Mahoney , and he's replaced by the charming Matt McCoy , who plays Commandant Lassard's nephew Nick , an ace Sergeant on the Miami Beach force . The character is a noble effort , but Mahoney is definitely missed . I must have watched this one the most when I was a kid because I remember it more than any of the others in the series , and I watched them all over the last couple weeks . I particularly remember the scene when Tackleberry fires off the assault weapons in shooting practice and then when they try to take the guns back he says , " NO ! ! I NEED these ! ! " Classic ! This particular installment in the series is famously bad , but anyone who tells you it's not any fun definitely needs to lighten up a little bit . The plot culminates in an exciting sequence when the little crime boss gives in to the frustrations of multiple failed attempts to get their bag back and just decides to kidnap Lassard in front of the whole congregation . Lassard of course , true to form , thinks it's all a demonstration and even helps the bad guys out along the way , winning their friendship and respect in probably the funniest element of the whole movie . Of course the fourth sequel in the Police Academy franchise is not a good movie , but it was never made with any Academy Awards in mind . In fact , since there are no wet t-shirt moments like in part 4 ( actually I was a little disappointed by this ) , you might even say it's a kid's movie , since it's the kids who are going to enjoy it the most , except for those of us who haven't seen it since we loved it as kids ourselves . By the way , if you manage to get it on DVD , make sure to check out the little ten minute documentary about it , it's hilarious ! I loved the ones about the earlier films , where they get most of the original cast together to talk about their experiences in making the movies . My favorite is Mission to Moscow , where producer Paul Maslansky talks about what a great film-making event it was making Police Academy 7 , finally and officially revealing himself to be genuinely delusional . But this one comes close ! Here's an actual quote from director Alan Myerson speaking about part 5 ? " For it's day , it was just short of a James Bond movie . " Uh-huh . Note - at one point , one of the bad guys calls Harris " sharkbait . " If they had copyrighted that , think of the killing they could have made off of Finding Nemo !
544380	562732	115798	6.0	Too early .	Being a fairly die-hard Jim Carrey fan , I hesitate to condemn this movie as much as many people have . I've even seen the movie ridiculed on The Simpsons ( in one episode , I think Homer and Bart find some kind of secret vault , which contains The Cable Guy script , the GOOD version , which apparently never saw the light of day ) . Where the movie goes wrong is when it tries to turn from a comedy and into a thriller . Coming fresh out of such hilarious appearances as the first Ace Ventura sequel , Dumb & Dumber , Batman Forever and the somewhat less impressive The Mask , it was just too early for Carrey to move from such over the top performances and into the realm of playing a threatening stalker . Maybe not even too early , just too sudden of a change . Later in his career , Carrey would prove his impressive ability to play dramatic characters , in movies like The Majestic , The Truman Show , Man on the Moon , and by far the best so far , Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind . Even now I don't think Carrey could pull off a threatening character , but not through any fault of his own . For the same reason that Denzel Washington simply can't be killed Godfather style , Carrey can't be frightening or scary . The man's loved . Matthew Broderick turns in a sufficiently self-pitying performance as Steven Kovacs , recently dumped by his girlfriend and moving into an apartment by himself . The cable guy picks up on the heartbreak in the air immediately , and then proceeds to begin a relationship with Steven by hooking him up with free cable . I'm almost sad to see how completely Broderick has lost the slick confidence that he enjoyed as Ferris Bueller , but such is life . Much like many child stars , he grew up to be something completely different . At least in the movies . The movie succeeds in showing the gradual deterioration of the friendship between the unnamed cable guy and Steven , which gradually changes from a casual friendship to genuine stalking , with Steven's own friends and family thinking that he's overreacting to the cable guy who has charmed his way into all of their hearts . But it doesn't know when to stop . The cable guy didn't have to go crazy in order for his stalking of Steven to be effective . Indeed , a good comedy would have avoided that like the plague , but The Cable Guy runs for it . Not only does he become a dangerous stalker far beyond the criminal border , he turns into a movie villain , like in a trashy mystery / thriller . It fails where a movie like Shaun of the Dead succeeded spectacularly , in blending two genres that don't fit together very well . As I find myself saying all too often , it tries to do too much and ends up not doing much at all . At the very least , however , I have to admit that I was still impressed with Carrey's performance , at least in the first half of the movie . That basketball game was absolutely priceless , it's just too bad that the rest of the movie didn't go in a similar direction .
544519	562732	305224	6.0	I wasn't sure to expect a great comedy because Jack Nicholson was in it or a ridiculous comedy because Adam Sandler was in it , but I should have known .	Jack Nicholson has an endless ability to entertain , he's one of the VERY few men in Hollywood that are just fun to watch almost regardless of what movie they're in , but unfortunately he is not able to overcome Sandler's equal skills in goofy childish humor , which generally serve to dumb his movies down and challenge the audience to pretend they're not watching a kid's movie packed with bad taste . Anger Management definitely had its share of good moments , but as a whole it's one of those movies that is going to a very specific destination , and had better do something interesting along the way . The problem is that the only interesting thing it does along the way is give Adam Sandler one excuse after another to get angry , combining the hilarity of his desperate attempts to control his anger in Happy Gilmore with his sudden outbursts of gratuitous ( and strangely satisfying ) violence from The Waterboy . Jack Nicholson is great as the questionable anger management therapist , although I'm still not 100 % sure why he signed on with what was sure to have been from the beginning just another goofy Sandler comedy , although I'm sure he had a good time making the film . Just before I saw the movie , I was getting ready to tape the MTV Icon show about Metallica , and I caught the last half or so of a show called Punk'd , that featured Brittany Spears and that guy from that one TV show , the 70's Show I think , and basically they played a lot of pranks on different people and each other in a thinly disguised Tom Green style . I normally don't watch much TV , so I was surprised to watch a few minutes of that show and then see almost exactly the same thing in Anger Management . Jack Nicholson's character in the movie was the type of anger management therapist whose therapy consists of similar tactics , playing pranks on people in order to get them to recover from their anger without even really realizing that their therapist is doing anything other than screwing with them to piss them off even more . There are plenty of tricks which would not get very far in the real world without resulting in a pile of serious lawsuits , regardless of how many judges you know . We never find out , for example , who the owner of the ill-fated Lexus was , and I'd like to hear what kind of insurance company would buy a brand new Lexus that fell off a building just because it had a business card on it . Maybe he knows some people down there , too . The therapy sessions are some of the best scenes in the movie ( besides the singing parts , which were so funny that I might try them out myself the next time I get mad ) , but there are only two or three of them , and even those are a little contrived . John Turturro has a great role as one of the other people in the therapy group , a man who has an intense anger problem and is in constant need of help with it , and of course Sandler fans will have a blast pointing out all of the actors that turn up in all of his movies . Sadly , however , they may have more fun doing this than watching the movie . ( spoilers ) The end of the movie contains a brief scene that goes back and explains what was happening in key scenes , which is a universal sign of weak script-writing . Unless this is a Scooby Doo cartoon , there had better be a better way to explain to the audience what happened . In this case , the movie allows us to believe something that is obviously untrue just so the rest of the movie makes sense . For example , we are initially led to believe that the entire reason for the assignation of anger management therapy in the first place , which leads to the premise for the rest of the movie , was because of a scene on an airplane where Sandler was badly mistreated by the attendants and then assaulted by a man pretending to be a security guard , even though he was just a disgruntled passenger . If you look at the movie overall , the only message it delivers is about staying in your assigned seat on the airplane . Everything always works out a little too conveniently and according to Nicholson's dubious plan , which is occasionally accounted for only by suggesting that he knows certain people that helped his plan along , such as the judge and the radio newscasters at the baseball game . It's like The Cable Guy with anger management therapy instead of cable . I was just waiting for Sandler to try to call the police on Nicholson , only to have Nicholson grin and say to the officer , ' How's that therapy working out for you ? ' Of course the movie ends with Sandler getting the girl in front of a whole baseball stadium full of people , as Nicholson smiles at the top of the stairway and walks off into the stadium like a guardian angel . Very cute , but hopefully no one ever took the movie as something that was meant to be taken serious at all . The way the movie eventually works out is not entirely unsatisfying in any way , despite how obviously contrived it all is , but it is just packaged a little too neatly . Most movies are packaged pretty neatly these days , but the reason this causes a problem for Anger Management is because it is a movie with such a huge amount of variables . There are so many risky stunts pulled and so many different explosive characters that it is just too much to ask us to believe that it could end not only as happily as it did , but with a whole stadium full of people cheering for our hero and his girlfriend at the end of the movie . Anger Management is not a bad date movie , but it even presses the boundaries of this genre pretty hard at some points . I am a little confused as to who exactly the target audience is for a movie like this , besides the obvious Sandler fans who will watch any movie that he comes out with ( I happen to be among this group , just not the group that will love any movie that he comes out with just because he's in it ) , but it's unfortunate that there are so many Jack Nicholson fans ( more than likely a group of people who have slightly more mature taste in movies ) that are going to hate it because Nicholson's skill was not able to pull the movie away from Sandler's childishness . Sadly , the movie is something of a kid's movie that contains one too many lesbian adult film stars to be any good for the kids to watch . Evidently Sandler and his producers are operating under the firm belief that their audience has increased in age but not maturity . Anger Management is made for the kids who have grown up and now want to see what they weren't allowed to before . But hey , at least they tagged on a cute ending .
544270	562732	3733	6.0	Kid auto races in drag .	Not much is the same about A Busy Day and Kid Auto Races at Venice except that for the early scene in this film where Chaplin is causing a disruption at a parade , where a camera crew are attempting to film . He begins as a member of the audience ( a female member , as it were ) , and almost immediately begins kicking and punching everyone in sight , and repeatedly being thrown into the same policeman , who seems each time to find the incident surprising and annoying but otherwise unimportant . As was the case in The Masquerader , Charlie is oddly convincing as a woman , and it is not until he starts throwing punches and kicks that it becomes clear that he is Charlie and not a woman . His diminutive stature and effeminate demeanor ( not to mention the absence of close-ups and the help of almost 100 years of deteriorated film stock ) help to pass him off as a woman , but his behavior is so familiar from so many short comedies full of punching and kicking that once the comedic violence starts , it's just Chaplin in a dress doing the same thing that he did in so many other films at the time . Of course , I say all of this in retrospect , because I am sure at the time audiences found the idea of a man dressing up like a woman and starting fights was endlessly hilarious , but the content of the comedy has not fared quite as well as Chaplin's later work . ( spoiler ) But at least since he insists on ending another film by falling in the water , he puts something of a spin on the idea here . I did , however , also find this film a bit interesting because it was filmed on location , so it shows a little of what Los Angeles looked like almost 100 years ago . I only wish I knew where exactly in LA it was filmed , just because I know the city so well and I love to think about Chaplin shooting his films on the same streets where I have been so many times . In A Day's Pleasure , for example , the opening scene is shot right next to his studio on La Brea Avenue , where I have been countless times , and I find it to be fascinating to look at that film and then go look at what the exact same spot looks like today .
544485	562732	388482	7.0	Jason Statham ? Jet Ski Pilot . Jason Statham ? Jet Ski Pilot .	The first sequel in the Transporter franchise obeys all of the rules of sequels ? bigger budget , bigger death count , more gloss , and at least one more lingerie-clad hottie with two hand-held machine guns . It's otherwise exactly the same movie as the original , with a few negligible plot modifications . What isn't changed is the ready-made action movie premise , this time using such an old action cliché that the first thing I thought of was those little sponge-things I used to make my mom buy me when I was a kid . You put a drop of water on it and in a couple minutes it turns into a dinosaur or something . But beyond the just-add-water instant action movie beginning , it at least ultimately proves to be another example of the over-the-top action extravaganza that the series has come to be known for . The movie works because it knows not to take itself seriously , and while this prohibits it from anyone in the audience being in danger of taking anything seriously , it doesn't stop it from being fun . There is a scene in the movie where Frank notices a bomb strapped to the underside of his car , and when I saw the way he managed to dislodge it I laughed out loud , and not necessarily in a bad way . You will laugh too , but there is a distinct feeling that you're laughing with the movie and not at it , and that right there is exactly what makes it fun . Frank Martin has been doing some chauffeuring duties for the wealthy Billings family ? Jefferson , who works in drug control for the government , and his estranged wife Audrey - and ends up making an unlikely friendship with their 6-year-old son Jack . But don't worry , the unlikeliness of that friendship very soon looks very normal when compared to the rest of the plot developments . Jack is kidnapped by a stereotypical Colombian villain and his henchmen , which include his statuesque blonde girlfriend ( who spends the entire movie wearing nothing but skimpy lingerie and a ton of eyeshadow ) and a bunch of meathead henchmen . So get this , the villain , like me , is Colombian , so of course he's hell-bent on flooding the world with cocaine , but wait until you hear his plan ! His scheme is to infect Jack with a deadly airborne virus that will in turn infect anyone who comes into contact with him . They don't want a ransom , they hand the kid back with amazingly little resistance . But Jefferson is soon attending a conference with lots of high-level officials involved in the U . S . drug control infrastructure . You see where this is going ? I hope so , because while the plot is actually a little more complex than you would expect from a movie like this , it doesn't slow down for very long to give you time to think about anything , which I suppose is just as well . It moves frantically from one action set piece to the next , balancing out the preposterous action sequences with greater emotional involvement than the original movie in the relationship between Jack and Frank . But when it comes down to it , The Transporter 2 is exactly the same thing as the original movie . It has all the same ingredients but in slightly different quantities , so your opinion of the first movie is going to give you a much better idea of how you'll like the second one than any review is going to . Then again , something tells me that a good portion of the Transporter target audience aren't big readers , so maybe I'm wasting my time here anyway ? Nah , I'm just kidding . That'll be my bad joke for the day . But regardless of the reading habits of the Transporter fan club , I don't need to explain to you that this is not an intelligent action movie . It's a super-fast action thriller with stunts that would make James Bond nervous and a lot of people shooting each other up , but I would be lying if I said it wasn't entertaining ?
543978	562732	45888	7.0	" A man has to be a little nuts to be a good showman ? "	One of the few things that I really didn't like about the wax film that preceded this one , The Mystery of the House of Wax , was the way Ivan Igor's partner rushed to burn down the museum minutes after an art critic informed Igor that he was going to make his work famous and him a rich man , because he had just received this immense news and then his aggravated partner walked in seconds later and burned the place down for the insurance money . It was just so hard to accept that Igor's partner moved so fast that he was simply unable to utter a word about what new events had so recently transpired . In this film , Ivan Igor is played by Professor Henry Jarrod who is played by Vincent Price , and his partner is in full earshot when he hears the news that an art critic may want to buy into the project and free his own investment for whatever else he has in mind . Other events lead to him being unable to accept the offer , and the idea of cashing in on the insurance money remains on the table without the need for any fast talking or lack of an opportunity to get a word in edgewise about impending success in order for it to come about . Quite a nice little wrinkle that has been ironed out there , I should think . This does , however , render the overzealous investor into more of a villain than he was in the original film , especially when he carelessly tosses kerosene onto Jarrod as he is walking around dousing the sculptures to make them burn faster . It's possible that he is meant to have thought Jarrod was just another realistic statue , but he had to have known that he was still in there when he went around blowing out candles to cause a build-up of gas in the building . Evidently he didn't feel like sharing that insurance money !
544397	562732	193364	7.0	Goofy but fun !	When I was a kid I was a pretty die-hard Van Damme fan , but somewhere along the years I kind of drifted away from watching his movies and , more and more , as I saw the increasingly goofy looking cover boxes of his movies in the video stores , I felt that he had descended from a b-movie action / martial arts icon into trashy , routine action movies hardly discernible from each other . And while a lot of his more recent movies are distantly below the quality of his more gritty , early fighting movies , they still have a unique charm and entertainment value that never seems to be lost , no matter how cheesy the movie is . A quick look through the user reviews on the IMDb for any of his movies , for example , will always reveal that Van Damme has plenty of loyal fans . The Order starts off with the impression that it is going to shoot for some much more meaningful content than his movies generally have , as we get a back story of a valiant that is struck by the hypocrisy of people killing other people in the name of religion , and so decides to set off and start his own religion . Unfortunately , a lot of the Crusaders weren't so happy about that , so some of the ones that he originally commanded attacked and killed him and his followers , and an important chapter of his religious writing was lost . Jump ahead to modern day Odessa , Ukraine , an important location in film history , and soon we realize that the status of that last chapter is more important simply as a cultural relic than for what it is about . Van Damme plays a smart-talking artifact thief , who makes big money stealing important artifacts and then smuggling them to foreign buyers . Soon it is revealed that his father has found that lost chapter , but then disappears , and Van Damme finds himself in the classic situation where his father has been kidnapped , but not only will the police not help him , they suspect him of the recent murder of a prominent professor , who was played by Charlton Heston , who's talent is conspicuously wasted in the movie . He's given nothing to do but spout meaningless lines and then get killed . Bizarre . At any rate , I love the Israeli police , who detain Van Damme under suspicion of murder , and they check him into a hotel while they complete their investigation . This must be the most generous police force in the world , I always thought murder suspects were kept in jail , at least as they awaited trial . Needless to say , he is in the hotel room for less than a minute before rappelling out the window the the unguarded front of the hotel , where he jumps into a taxi and heads off into the night . Nice ! There's a strangely interesting scene where he is chased through the streets of Jerusalem dressed as a rabbi and with the unquestioning help of the local people , who must really hate the police . I was struck by how the rabbi's costume seemed a little bit tarnished by this kind of chase , but maybe the filmmakers realized that , too , so they wanted to make sure to recognize the Hebrew culture that they were questionably representing . After one man gets punched by the hottie police officer , he sits up , dazed , and mutters , " Oy vey ! " Or even better , when Van Damme is finally captured and is again refused help in finding his father , he says , " Something is not kosher here . " I agree ! The rest of the movie gave me an unmistakable impression that it was more than a little bit inspired by Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade , since the father and son relationship in this movie is remarkably similar to the relationship between Indy and his father . But no matter . The content of the movie is unmistakably cheesy , and it's obvious that there is nothing original in it , but it also knows this and doesn't shoot for the stars . It knows what kind of movie it is and , in scenes like the rabbi chase , it gives the feeling that it's just here to have fun , so hopefully you will too . I did ?
544626	562732	323250	7.0	Evidently new cars are BAD !	This is a clever short film that strikes me as something of a deleted scene from Monsters , Inc , into which this short film would have fit quite nicely , especially clocking in at a whopping three and a half minutes ! It's an interesting illustration of the dangers of upgrading to these high tech new cars available today , especially if you are just a regular guy like Mike . He buys this fancy new car with six wheels and can't contain himself at how cool it is , and then he and Sulley get beaten up by it because they have no idea how to use it . It's probably something similar to what would happen to me if I managed to get my hands on a brand new car . When cars are driving themselves I'll still be excited to have power steering . It's pretty funny to see Mike and Sulley struggle to figure out the new car , especially when Sulley gets all fascinated by the power seats , quickly annoying Mike , who seconds earlier couldn't wait to show him all the new gadgets in his fancy new car . I have come to expect more than this from Pixar , though , especially in their short films , which generally contain enough charm and amusement in just a few minutes to fill a full-length movie . This is a cute film , but it is not up to the level of other great films from them , like Geri's Game or For the Birds . Still a pretty cute film , though , and it's not like you can really complain about a three and a half minute short anyway , right ?
543762	562732	1027862	7.0	Every vote counts , as long as you're the last one ?	I'm going to go ahead and assume that it's not an easy task to make a crowd-pleasing movie centered on politics that goes to such strenuous efforts to be non-partisan and maybe chalk up my dissatisfaction with the movie to that . Then again , it might also have something to do with a critical decision that they made in how to end the movie , which is sure to make every single solitary person who watches it throw up their arms in disgust . But the movie is not about who wins the presidency , it's about the pure chaos of the American political system and its millions of weaknesses and faults . Sure , the premise of a presidential election coming down to a single vote is as preposterous as they come , but man if this movie doesn't get you thinking critically about the electoral process then it's safe to assume that probably nothing ever will . Kevin Costner plays Bud , an American nobody from New Mexico who has never done anything with his life except have a daughter with a delusional drug addict who thinks she has a big singing career in her near future . He works as an egg inspector at an egg packaging plant , and he and his co-workers mourn the loss of their friends ' ( and soon , their own ) jobs to " insourcing , " the process of bringing Mexicans in to take their jobs rather than ship the factory and all those egg-laying chickens to Mexico . Bud staggers through life in a drunken daze most of the time , routinely letting down his daughter Molly ( Madeline Carroll ) , who raises him like a child . She gets him out of bed in the morning , criticizes his laziness and irresponsibility , reminds him to vote because it's part of a school project that she has to do , and through sighs of exasperation attempts to keep him at least a little bit in line . And of course it's the only thing in life that she fails at . When Bud gets drunk rather than show up to vote , she manages to almost cast his vote herself due to the sleepy voting booth security of beautiful Texico , New Mexico , which Google Earth has just informed me is a real place . Population 1 , 065 . In a clever plot development , it turns out that Bud's vote didn't go completely through but it appeared that he was there , so he is given another opportunity to cast his vote . Not right away , mind you , even though he evidently already tried to vote and thus probably had his mind made up . No , he is given ten days before he has to vote , thus providing plenty of time for a movie to happen . Young Madeline Carroll steals most of the scenes that she's in as Bud's daughter , so it's interesting that her character is one of the biggest weak points in the movie , the other one being her dad . Bud is supposed to be a typical American , but I just saw a drifting drunk who never did anything with his life and never would have had he not been forced to . It's true that the vast majority of Americans live lives that are closer to Bud's than President Boone's ( Kelsey Grammar ) , but does he have to be a TOTAL loser ? How about just making him be a likable , regular guy ? Like the guy he played in Field of Dreams ? When I imagine the average American , I imagine something like Ray Kinsella . Although maybe with a slightly smaller house and less whispering from the sky . The other problem is that the screenwriters overshot the character of Molly by about 160 IQ points . So much for the average American , right ? This girl writes a school essay that doesn't merit a special award from the principal to show her dad , it grants her NATIONAL TELEVISED RECOGNITION . But to be honest , I had more of a problem with the fact that not only does she wake her deadbeat dad up in the morning so he could take her to school , she also treks to the bar and , finding him passed out in his truck when he should have been voting , she pushes him over and then drives him home herself . She's about 11 years old . But where the movie succeeds is as a scathing revelation about certain realities of the American electoral process , such as the electoral college , which simplifies the vote-counting process even while massively distorting the actual numbers of who voted for who . The whole movie is about how one man's vote really does matter , but it leaves you with the feeling that you are supposed to forget that once he votes , every single vote in his state for the other candidate WON'T matter anymore , because they'll be switched to the other candidate . Isn't it interesting how that works ? Can't we just count every single vote and award each candidate one huge number of individual votes ? Seems a little more accurate to me . Anyway , I do appreciate the way the movie highlights the fact that both sides , Republican and Democrat , are equally willing to stoop to any level and do absolutely whatever it takes to win , and that no one is above hitting below the belt and making hugely unethical decisions . There is a lot that needs to be changed in American politics , and even while clearly being based on the Election of 2000 , one of the most controversial in American history , it calls those things to attention without ever even hinting that either side is right or wrong . The movie insists that America is the greatest country in the world but that in some ways , we're doing it all wrong , but the fact that a movie like this has the freedom to get made proves that even though we haven't reached a level of pure cohesive harmony , underneath all of our imperfections is a clear desire to get there .
544153	562732	78753	7.0	A much needed update that still needs updating . . .	It is strange that a made-for-TV-remake ( and yes , this is definitely a remake ) of the Best Picture winner from 1930 should be so easily as good , and probably better , than the original . This is a special situation because most of what needed improvement in the original was not things that required special effects or much movie magic ( the battle scenes , for example , are outstanding in both films ) , but the realism of it all , specifically things like life on the battlefield , realistic dialogue , and clumsy thematic delivery . FIrst of all , the movie starts right out on the battlefield and is pretty impressive right away . Donald Pleasance is wonderful as the German propaganda teacher buttering the young men up for enlistment , and very soon you'll notice that a lot of the scenes are taken directly out of the original except , as I mentioned , now the realism is updated , which is extremely important . All Quiet on the Western Front , love it or hate it , is one of the most famous anti-war films / books of all time , and because of that , most of the more memorable scenes in the film are meant to deliver this message , but some work and some don't work so well . There is a scene , for example , where the new recruits line up in front of the train and see the wounded being brought back before their very eyes . It's a moving scene , to be sure , but I imagine removing the badly wounded soldiers right in front of the new soldiers heading to the front lines would have been considered bad taste even during World War I . Especially in propaganda-heavy Germany . Speaking of which , the fact that the movie is told from the German perspective is a bit of a difficult area for the film , since it stars almost entirely American and British actors , and we only know they're German , other than from a background knowledge of the story , because it's mentioned a few times through dialogue . The point of the story is to illustrate the difference between gloriously fighting for your country and the reality of trench-warfare . As soon as the new recruits arrive at the front , Ernest Borgnine , in an exceptional performance as Kat , the most experienced private on the front lines , quickly lets them know that even after all of their training , they don't know a single thing about war ( " In training camp they fill you full of fancy information on how to be a soldier . We're going to work hard to forget all that . " ) . While most of the more clunky scenes are smoothed out in this remake , some of them are still pretty obvious . I was happy to see that the scene where Paul Baumer , one of the main characters , kills a Frenchman in hand-to-hand combat and then bitterly remorses the act afterwards is changed , but it's not changed much . He mortally injures the man and is then stuck in a hole with him until morning , when he finally dies . He does give a bit of a ham-handed speech , but at least it's more realistic than the original . More importantly , this time it takes the focus away from the pointlessness of war deaths and turns it to the politicians , who come across as warmongers ( " We could be brothers . But they never want us to know that . They never want us to know . . . " ) . Makes you shudder to think of them generating hatred among young men like puppet-masters so they can send them over to further their agendas . The end of the film faithfully re-creates the end of the original , with Baumer taking a trip home due to an injury , only to be confronted with the reality that his country is completely removed from what is really happening on the western front . It's strange though , that when he embarks on his 16 days of convalescent leave , he does so in full battle gear - helmet , grenades , rifle and everything . Seems like that might be a little unnerving to the public . Nevertheless , the movie certainly gets its point across , but it still leaves me with the feeling that it can still be so much more . It is a very effective piece of anti-war cinema , but even with all of the improvements since the 1930 version , it is still not authentic .
544219	562732	416449	7.0	Wow , I gotta start working out . . .	I remember I almost fell out of my chair when I first saw the preview for 300 , although it's taken me over a year since I bought the DVD to get around to watching it . Maybe because the bad reviews started trickling in . It's an adaptation of a graphic novel that I haven't read , but I'm told that that novel portrays a sort of heightened reality like what Leonidas describes as he is faced with seemingly insurmountable danger . The movie retains that level of hyper - reality and achieves a truly unique look and experience , but it may put off viewers interested in seeing something about the real story that the film is based on . Of course , the true story of a hugely inferior band of Spartans holding out against the Persian army is so clouded in myth and legend that by now it's impossible to say for sure what really happened , but we can probably assume that a good majority of what happens in this movie didn't happen . My knowledge of ancient Greek history is pretty limited , to say the least , but I was sort of expecting that the movie would tell something about what happened at the Battle of Thermopylae , where the courageous Spartans took their stand . Instead , it's sort of a bloated comic-book movie the sometimes doesn't seem to know whether it wants to emulate Troy , Lord of the Rings , or Harry Potter . There's a hunchback , there's magic , there are fully grown mountain dwarfs , a healthy dose of Hollywood / comic book machismo , and lots of spraying blood that reminded me of Tarantino's spectacularly disappointing Sin City . At least here it's not green . In the movie's defense , it is definitely an astonishing visual achievement . It's true that the entire film is digital and you are never able to forget that , but it is definitely beautiful . The problem with digital backgrounds is that , apparently , they still haven't been able to make them look really realistic , especially battle scenes . I'm pretty sure they're making video games these days that look this good . Half of the reason I wanted to see the movie was because of the tough talk in defiance of so - called authority , I always love that . Have you seen those " Caution : This is Sparta " signs ? HILARIOUS . Anyway , there are a lot of classic moments and memorable lines in the movie ( " There's no reason we can't be civil , is there ? " ) , but after a while I found the over-the-top bravado a little cloying and just a little too , ah , over-the-top . There is no sense of realism , but then again the movie never tries for it . It is , basically , a romanticized and dramatized telling of a historical battle , just like what Braveheart is . But this movie is romanticized and dramatized in completely different ways . Ultimately , I think the result is better off intended for a slightly younger audience . The performances in the film are wonderful , sometimes even astonishing . Gerard Butler as Leonidas is one of the most intense performances I've seen in a movie in some years , reminding me for some reason of the unbelievable level of intensity that Tom Cruise brought to Mission Impossible III . I noticed some IMDb user make the bizarre claim that Xerxes , played by Rodrigo Santoro , looked gay . Yes , Xerxes is quite a spectacle to behold , but effeminate ? PLEASE . The only thing remotely effeminate about him were his eyebrows , but other than that he had the otherworldly presence that a living god should have . And besides , I have to say that I wonder about anyone who could hear his voice and think androgyny ! 300 was a slight disappointment to me , but it definitely succeeds in what it sets out to do . It's a wild ride from start to finish and it never lets up , but I can't deny that there are some definite cheese moments , even for a film like this . It promises basically 100 minutes of exactly what you see in that almost weirdly impressive theatrical trailer , and if you can handle that for a couple hours , you're in for a treat . Terrible date movie , though . . .
543939	562732	115665	7.0	Very stylish , but I still think the Japanese are better at horror than action .	The description of Beyond Hypothermia really sounded a lot more interesting on the back of the movie box than the movie turned out to be . It is a very stylish thriller about a deadly assassin who constantly dreams of having a normal life with a husband and children , but it really doesn't do anything new in the genre . My favorite thing about the movie was the way it is cut together , especially many of the death scenes . The first assassination in the movie , for example , shows what you normally see in such a scene , the close up of the scope with the killer's eye behind it , the victim going about his business oblivious that he's in someone's crosshairs , the slow motion , etc . But the actual death avoids showing the man getting shot . Instead , we see the two guys behind him pouring wine out of a wine bottle that suddenly explodes ( a curious occurrence that they mysteriously respond to with laughter ) . As I was watching the movie , I was reminded of the stylish originality of movies like The Way of the Gun , as well as a few other foreign films that I've seen recently in which massive numbers of people get shot , such as the disturbing but hugely impressive Battle Royale , and the equally disturbing and probably even more impressive Portuguese film City of God . One thing that I really liked about this movie , as well as the ones I just mentioned , is that even though an enormous number of people are shot dead , it is not done in such a relentless way that you completely stop caring . No , you're not going to jump out of your seat every time some extra gets shot , but watch a movie like John Woo's Killer and you'll see how large numbers of gunshot killings can be numbing to the point of boredom . Not exactly what you would expect from John Woo , who otherwise is a very skilled action director ( except for that Windtalkers mess ) . Here's one thing I didn't understand , though . At one point in the movie there's a lot of bad guys chasing the god girl through oncoming traffic , and the bad guys keep getting hit by cars . Now , it is to be expected that people are going to be hit by cars when they're sprinting into oncoming traffic , but these guys are chasing after the woman that is supposed to be Japan's deadliest assassin , and they don't even have the sense not to run right in the middle of lanes of traffic when they're chasing her down the street ! No wonder they can't catch her ! It's true that the movie doesn't cover much new ground , but it is short enough to remain worth watching , if only for its style . Sadly , I made the mistake of renting the dubbed version , and I am fairly confident that the original film with subtitles is even more enjoyable . I don't know what it is about dubbed movies , they just seem so fake with someone so obviously voicing over the lines . Look for the original language version , because it's worth checking out .
544363	562732	205000	7.0	Not as cheesy as it looks .	Sure , Deuce Bigalow is not exactly a landmark cinematic accomplishment . It's full of dirty jokes and childish humor , but underneath all of the goofball comedy , it actually comes through with a very healthy message , which is virtually non-existent in these dumb comedies . Deuce Bigalow is a lowly fish tank cleaner , and when one of his important clients has to leave town on business , he hires Deuce to look after his place and especially one of his precious fish , which would not survive on it's own the entire time that Anton ( the client ) is out of town . Needless to say , Deuce starts screwing around in the lavish apartment and breaks Anton's ridiculously expensive fish tank and then has to come up with $6 , 000 to replace it and do other repairs around the house . This is when Deuce has the brilliant idea to assume Anton's job as a gigolo , because he knows he'll never make the money on time cleaning fish tanks . Unfortunately , he gets all of the freaky clients , like the gigantic black woman ( ' Did you say steak ? ' ) and the eight foot tall girl ( ' That's a huge bitch ! ' ) , the girl with narcolepsy that falls asleep at the weirdest times , and of course , they could never leave out a date with Tourette's syndrome , definitely the least amusing of all of them . So Deuce goes through all of these awful dates , and then he meets a girl on another date that is perfect except she has a prosthetic leg . This is where the healthy message comes in , because Deuce learns that he really loves this girl , and it really doesn't matter to him that she only has one leg . He falls in love with her pretty quick , but the romance of it all , as cheesy as it was , is actually pretty well done . Deuce is trying to get enough money to replace the stuff in Anton's apartment , so he goes on one last date with one of Anton's stunningly beautiful clients , and he even rejects her aggressive sexual advances because he's in love . Sure , he does a pretty graphic strip-tease for her , but you get the point of his intentions . However , despite the fact that the movie is full of goofy jokes , some of the comedy was pretty good . Deuce's toilet-cleaning father was pretty amusing at some points , and most of all , the detective that was after Deuce and especially Anton ( his wife was one of Anton's clients ) was hilarious in every scene he was in . ' I got a thin dick ! ' Why is that so funny ? It's totally dumb , but it just cracked me up . Maybe it's because he compared it to spaghetti . It was just great how he was at first really threatening to Deuce , and then he would suddenly ask his advice about whether Deuce thought he could make some money in the gigolo business or what he thought that red spot on his penis was ( ' It wasn't there this morning , I checked ! ' ) . As a whole , this is another one of those brainless comedies aimed at immature or uneducated ( or both ) audiences , but it doesn't fail on just about all levels like most of these types of movies always seem to do . It's a strong and healthy message delivered in questionable packaging .
544180	562732	100258	7.0	A worthy installment .	The script is pretty weak and at least as many bad things as good things were brought over from the original for this remake , but the 1990 version of George Romero's classic horror film has its heart in the right place , I guess you could say . The movie wastes no time , starting out in a cemetery where a bickering brother and sister have driven no small amount of distance to visit the grave of their mother . So the Don't Go Into A Cemetery rule of horror movies is immediately broken and swiftly punished . I really liked the way the zombies were introduced , it reminded me of the zombies in Shaun of the Dead , where Shaun walked among them , not paying attention to his surroundings , before noticing that he was surrounded by the walking dead . Patricia Tallman turns in a satisfactory performance as Barbara , the sister involved in the opening scene and the heroine of the movie . I thought it was strange that she turns out to be such a strong character when at the beginning of the movie she was immediately reduced to a blubbering basket-case when she arrived at the farmhouse in which most of the movie takes place . Granted , she had just witnessed her brother being killed by a zombie , but no matter how much I sympathize with their plight , I can't stand hysterical people in horror movies , male or female . When someone starts whining and moaning and screaming and crying and sobbing and blubbering and won't even respond to someone shaking them and hollering into their face , I just want them to hurry up and get killed so they'll shut the hell up . Harry Cooper is still the same ridiculous jerkoff he was in the first movie , displaying an entirely unacceptable and unjustifiable state of constant rage , even when finally finding himself in the company of other living , breathing people rather than mindless zombies . Just like the security guard in Dawn of the Dead , this guy wants his own way , even if it means separating himself from other living people , who are fast becoming an endangered species . One thing I'm not sure I understand is the way his insults have been updated to fit the modern times of 1990 . At one point , after locking himself , his wife and his zombie-bitten daughter alone together in the basement , he flings a few more vicious insults at the people in the rest of the house , curiously calling them ' lame-brains , ' and ' yo-yo's . ' If this movie was meant to be shown on the Disney channel , I could understand including such words in the script . But it wasn't . I don't even think the Disney channel was around in 1990 . The zombies are updated , needless to say , but they're not over-the-top and they maintain the general appearance of the original zombies . There's nothing worse than using special effects just because they're there , and this remake doesn't do it . Then there are newer horror movies made that try to improve upon the make-up in the original films , such as the first color installment in the Night of the Living Dead series , the original Dawn of the Dead , tried to do it in color and wound up with a lot of bad extras wearing blue make-up all over their faces . Awful . ( spoilers ) There are lots of radio broadcasts throughout about an epidemic of mass murder being committed by a virtual army of unidentified assassins and do not attempt to reach loved ones and blah blah blah . A brother and sister finally get Ben's truck running enough to get it to the gas pump ( the fact that it was out of gas should have been mentioned earlier than it was , because it looked a little ridiculous to see him drive up to the house and then frantically shake Barbara , asking her repeatedly if she has a car ) , only to be killed by fatal stupidity . I have to admit that I thought the ending was fairly clever . The horribly ironic ending of the original has been changed , but it's still horribly ironic . The whole gang of characters gets saved by a bunch of drunken rednecks , who gleefully and repeatedly shoot zombies between pounding cans of beer , stringing them up in the trees and whatnot , while one character has a bit of insight about the zombies , ' They're us and we're them . ' Nice , but I could have done without the philosophy lesson . I think this remake really tried hard to justify itself , to be more than just a static colorization of a classic , and I think that to a large extent it succeeds . Where it falls short is that it doesn't know what is good and what can be changed about the original . Lots of good is brought through , but there are a few things that I could simply have done without . I'm not a big fan of people remaking classic movies and changing them , but Harry Cooper needs a total character overhaul . Nevertheless , this one's worth a look .
544201	562732	758746	7.0	Jason Voorhees Still Mad About His Mom - ' Friday the 13th ' Review . . .	There comes a time in every overly long horror movie franchise when it's no longer necessary to add numbers at the end of the titles of the horizonless stream of sequels . This happened in the Friday the 13th series for the first time in part 4 , The Final Chapter , which incidentally is also the first time they put a bald-faced lie right into the title . Then the numbering system disappeared until part VI ( one of the only sequels worth watching ) , VII , and VIII , after which the whole titling process changed completely . In fact , no Friday the 13th movie has had " Friday the 13th " anywhere in the title since the stupendously bad Jason Takes Manhattan , which was released a full two decades ago . Now , the newest entry in the series is released with exactly the same title as the original ! I don't really want to contemplate what this means as far as the end of the series , if it will ever come . I tend to doubt it . Thankfully , the movie was a lot better than I expected . It would be something of an understatement to say that I had low expectations to begin with , but in the cinematic world of horror sequels , the new Friday the 13th is one of the better ones . The movie opens with a scene that shows little promise for a good horror movie . Anyone who has ever seen pretty much any Friday the 13th sequel will be immediately dismayed to see that they have elected to start this one off with the same thing - a bunch of idiot college kids wandering into the forest to get high and get laid , laughing and joking over a campfire about the legend of Jason Voorhees . " It all happened right here in these woods ! Right here where we are ! Jason could be right behind those trees ! Huh huh huh huh ! ! ! " Morons . This is , however , all part of a set-up that sets the stage for the rest of the movie , which thankfully takes a slightly different tact from the myriad of sequels that came before it . There's an opening sequence that's more than 20 minutes long that takes place before the opening title card , and then during the rest of the movie there's a college-age kid surveying all the people in the surrounding area of Camp Crystal Lake to find out if anyone has seen his missing sister , who was one of the kids in the beginning of the movie . Okay , maybe I lied . That's the only thing that's different . There is an unmistakable feeling that the only thing that ever changes in Friday the 13th movies is the kind of cars the kids drive and their accommodations . This time they're cruising along in an Escalade and staying in the vacation home of one of their parents . Evidently someone thought to buy a beautiful lakeside cabin at Crystal Lake , which until now never really struck me as a big vacation destination . The performances are uniformly bad throughout . They are exactly the same sophomoric idiots that star in every horror movie ever made that has high school or college kids in it . They show up making the same stupid jokes , wearing the same stupid halter tops and each representing the same stupid caricatures . The geek , the black kid , the jock ( s ) , the nervous good girl , the hot chick ( s ) , etc . But at least the paper thin characters make the admittedly clever and gruesome kills that much more satisfying . Kind of makes me wonder what a slasher film would be like if there was a single character in it that we cared about , you know ? Friday the 13th follows exactly the same formula that the series has followed who knows how many times before - a group of kids go into the woods together and manage to get separated from each other within usually less than ten minutes - but as Jason gets on in age ( by my calculations he should be somewhere in his early 60s by now ) he has gotten bigger and faster and stronger . This doesn't speak well for the logistical consistency of the series , but when has logic ever applied ? The Friday the 13th movies have always been the kind of movies that you watch at home on a late rainy night , usually best enjoyed with a bunch of friends and a 12-pack . I can't remember a time when a Friday the 13th movie has ever been scary , but I would be lying if I said I don't occasionally get a huge kick out of having a couple beers with my buddies and watching an old , bad horror movie , so what's so wrong with having a couple beers with my buddies and watching a new , bad horror movie ? Note : At one point in the movie , one of the characters says this line of dialogue - " Let's all be one big , happy cliché ! " I don't think I even need to comment on that .
544537	562732	3758	7.0	Entertaining short comedy by Charlie Chaplin that foreshadows a major theme of his later films .	Unfortunately , Caught In A Cabaret , being one of Chaplin's earliest films , has deteriorated pretty badly over the last nine decades or so , and this deterioration seems to have affected the film's continuity , making it look like the editing is botched . As is the case with most of Chaplin's films , the action in Caught In A Cabaret runs slightly faster than real life , which enhances much of the slapstick comedy but also makes several short clips in the film go by so fast that they are virtually incomprehensible . ( spoilers ) The main theme of Caught In A Cabaret deals with rich vs . poor , a theme that Chaplin later became famous for and which he made use of so often because of his own poverty stricken childhood . This film concerns a working man who pretends to be someone else in order to get accepted into a group of wealthy people . It is not expected that at the end he does not get the girl and winds up walking down a dirt road alone , but his activities throughout the film make his point clear . As he is at a party with the rich people , he gets drunk and makes something of a fool of himself , but when he is working as a waiter , he is fairly heroic , ridding the place of unwanted ruffians and whatnot . Caught In A Cabaret has not survived too well physically , but it is an excellent example of the type of early work Chaplin did as he became famous as one of the most loveable characters in cinematic history .
544442	562732	455824	7.0	All's Fair In Love And War Movies - ' Australia ' Review . . .	Australia has the old-fashioned feel of a classic war film ( I've even heard it compared to Gone With The Wind ) combined with a strange , polished futuristic feel of Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow . It takes place during World War II . Hitler has invaded Poland and the Australians fear that the Japanese forces may overflow into their northern territories at any time . The allied armies of the world will need to eat and it is the aim of a cattle-raising juggernaut in northern Australia named King Carney to be the sole provider of Australian beef to the war effort . Nicole Kidman plays Lady Sarah Ashley , the wife of a British rancher living in Australia receives disturbing reports that her husband has been philandering recklessly while he's supposed to be handling the business of their massive norther Australian cattle ranch , Faraway Downs . She travels to Australia to find out what's going on only to find that the rivalry in the Australian beef industry has taken a deadly turn . She finds her husband murdered and herself in the middle of a complex but confusing plot by the Carney people to trick her into selling her land , not knowing that that was her intention in the first place . When she discovers the truth about what they're doing , she changes her mind and decide to fight them for the war contracts . Lady Sarah attempts to enlist the help of Drover ( Hugh Jackman ) , who is hesitant because he refuses to accept any other job other than an independent contractor out of a deep dislike of the hiring / firing processes . Meanwhile , a young half-caste boy named Nullah has been living on the ranch with his mother and grandmother , hiding out in the water tower because , at that time , any aboriginal children who had been fathered or mothered by blacks were taken away and shipped to an island out on the ocean where the black will be " bred out of them . " The boy gives an astonishing performance , too . He provides the narrative centerpiece of the story , all other events ultimately revolve around him , including his grandfather , who is something of a witch doctor who the Carneys are trying to frame for the murder of Lady Sarah's husband . Australia is listed in part as a western , because it takes place in the dusty expanses of the Australian desert , across the most dangerous sections of which Lady Sarah and Drover must attempt to drive 1 , 500 head of cattle and load them onto the boats at the docks in northern Australia , all the while pursued by Carney's henchmen . The movie gives us a brilliantly presented picture of mid-WWII life in Australia , but it is also much too highly polished . The colors and textures are so bright that it almost looks like we're looking at the future , which left me with the feel that it would have been a much better movie had it had a much smaller budget . But worst of all is that , amidst all of the high-budget trickery and technological polish , the movie is literally peppered with obvious soundstages , cheap CGI and bad blue screens . How did that happen ? Maybe they spent all their post-production budget too soon by hiring Hugh Jackmand and Nicole Kidman ? The performances are almost universally outstanding , however , if a little over-exaggerated in some cases . Australian pubs , for example , are not exactly lady-friendly even 70 years after the movie takes place , but the comedic dramatization is pretty hard to miss . Nicole Kidman is outstanding as the highly proper British aristocrat suddenly thrown into company amidst hardened Australian cattle herders , although I imagine it would be nearly impossible to get a bad performance out of her in a role like that . Hugh Jackman , similarly , inhabits his role remarkably well . But unfortunately , despite being what might normally be called a sweeping historical epic , the movie is so over-processed that it has a permeating feeling of fakeness that never seems to go away , and not just because of the bad sound-stage scenes . For the most part it's beautiful photographed , is full of wonderful performances and as an engaging story , but there is always a sense that it's trying to be something even bigger but isn't exactly sure how to do it .
544706	562732	89885	8.0	Tons of campy fun .	Ah , finally a horror camp classic that deserves to be called a horror camp classic . Re-Animator is one of those fun horror movies that is so over the top that it is just a lot of fun to watch , kind of like the spectacular Evil Dead films , although not quite to that same level of skillful horror / comedy mix . Ironically enough , I think it should be a testament to the quality of the rest of the movie that it is able to work so well despite prominently featuring a soundtrack that is a naked rip-off of the Psycho soundtrack . It's amazing to me that Richard Bond , the music composer , didn't think anyone would notice him plagiarizing one of the most famous movie soundtracks in cinematic history , but luckily everyone else in the production was right on the mark . Jeffrey Combs delivers a wonderfully crazy performance as Herbert West , the scientist in the movie who is determined that he has discovered a scientific method to beat death , and is desperate to try it out on a human being rather than small animals , on whom he has had remarkable success . He is playing a completely one-dimensional character , a genius scientist whose mental capacity is also tinged with madness , but which is counterbalanced by the fact that he may very well be desperate to try something potentially immoral but which could also potentially revolutionize medicine . Maybe his intentions are good after all , but for the purposes of the film , he just wants to get his hands on some fresh corpses , which is a great premise for a horror film . The movie operates in its own world , like the Evil Dead films did . It takes place in the horror genre but wants to combine some elements of drama as well , as we have a real scientist who is truly brilliant . He is still in medical school , I believe , but is often smarter than his often-published professors , criticizing their work for being incorrect or even plagiarized . He's very quick to make enemies , I would think his line of work might be easier the less people he had watching him , so it's unfortunate that he was so good at making people not like him . Mere days after he rents out a room from a couple of other students , they find their cat dead in his refrigerator . I hate it when new roommates do that . There is plenty of gratuitous nudity in the film , and while I appreciate nudity as much as the next guy , I don't like it when it drives a weak film , and that is certainly not the case here . There is a graphic and highly disturbing nude scene three quarters or so through the film that made me literally cringe and turn my head , not because of gore but by the sheer disturbing idea of it , it was awful . But the thing that I loved is that that scene fits in with the rest of this movie so well . It is all about too much gore and too much blood and too much nudity , but also lots of laughs . This is a perfect example of how much fun scary movies can be .
544038	562732	89869	8.0	Hasn't dated well , but still a good example of what good science fiction used to look like .	A scientist named Zac Hobson wakes up to discover what is probably either most people's worst nightmare or biggest fantasy , that he is that last man alive on earth . The emptiness of the post-apocalyptic world is the result of a top-secret energy project gone horribly wrong ( don't stories where everyone in the world has died or disappeared usually result from some top-secret project or another gone wrong ? ) . For a while Zac basks in the denial that there's no one else in the world , and indulges in his materialistic fantasies until reality , as it were , sets in , and he begins to search in earnest for other survivors . Ultimately he discovers two others , a man and a woman , and the resulting love triangle is strangely interesting although awkwardly portrayed . The three characters , however awkward , propel the rest of the story in the direction of the bizarre but truly memorable ending . The performances in the film are much better than you might expect from mid 1980s science fiction , and the atmosphere of emptiness and desolation is startlingly convincing . The film hasn't dated well , but it's still good fun . For some reason I have grouped this movie in my mind with Soylent Green , another old science fiction film memorable for its uniqueness and unexpectedness . Both are good for an evening of unusual entertainment . Science fiction fans are sure to eat it up .
544137	562732	371174	8.0	Not necessarily better than the movie , but the movie sucks without it .	At the time of this writing , there are two other people who have reviewed The Saw is Family on the IMDb , and both claim that it's better than the movie itself . Initially I agreed with them because I was stupendously unimpressed with the movie . But since this documentary is focused mainly on allowing the cast and crew of Texas Chainsaw III to explain their reasons for why the movie turned out to be such a mess , I think that as a supplement it makes the film itself a lot better . I like that the documentary starts by going into rich detail about Ed Gein , the 1950s serial killer on whom the character of Leatherface was originally based . This guy cut the skins off of people and wore them on his body , providing the inspiration for Leatherface and Jame Gumb from Silence of the Lambs , and he was also obsessed with his dead mother , presumably inspiring the grandparents in the Texas Chainsaw films , as well as Norman Bates from Psycho . Very little attention is paid to the origin of these stories , not that someone as sick and twisted as Ed Gein deserves to be famous , but I liked that this documentary went into his story and told about where the story of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre originated . On a technical level , I was impressed with the editing , which is very fast paced but doesn't go too fast to follow . Also , it cuts together the interviews in a curious way , by splicing in a quick clip from the film when it switches from one interviewee to another , thereby avoiding the jarring feel that you get when editing multiple interview clips together , as was seen in the documentary Looking Back at The Hills Have Eyes , and which I've done myself . I always find it interesting to learn about the things that go on in the making of movies , and it seems that there are especially strange or interesting things that happen during the production of horror movies . In this case , we get an interesting behind the scenes look at the making of Texas Chainsaw III from the cast and crew themselves , and we also get an explanation for why a lot of the disappointing things that were in the movie ended up there , which I think allows you to look past a lot of that and see that it's really not as bad as you thought it was when you watched it . The Hills Have Eyes was an immensely well-made movie that did not get a very good reception because it is so unpleasant and the depth of the depravity displayed in it is often difficult to overlook . In the case of Texas Chainsaw III , however , you get a horror movie made with average directorial talent ( but , I have to say , above average acting , especially for a horror movie like this one ) , but that took on a feel of ineptitude because of things that went wrong during the post-production phase . But it seems that both movies benefit from a short documentary in which the cast and crew explain themselves .
544461	562732	734556	8.0	Serling's social commentary . . .	Like a great many twilight zone episodes , one of my favorite parts of this one was the overt social commentary that Serling is making with the story . As was the case with a recent episode " The Howling Man , " I was reminded of my long standing suspicion that , for example , if Jesus were to come to earth to bring his followers to Heaven , he would be immediately judged insane and probably thrown into an asylum . Our main character in this episode meets a similar problem when trying to convince the 1860s Americans that he is from the future and the President Lincoln is about to be assassinated . The episode wrongly asserts that this means that some parts of the past can be changed while others can't , but it's a fun time travelling romp nonetheless . Granted , we don't know for a fact whether history could be changed by time travel , because time travel has never been accomplished and , sadly , never will be . But it seems logical to me that , if you could physically place yourself in a time of the past , you could physically prevent something from happening , as long as you didn't flail around like a lunatic yelling about assassinations . One of the consistently interesting things about time travel films and TV shows , in my opinion , is the method by which the time travel takes place . There is really no method at all here , our main character is having a conversation about time travel at a posh gentlemen's club and then walks outside and into a dissolve from the early 1960s to the mid 1860s , but no matter . The twilight zone has thus far not struck me for its complex sets or high production values . Russell Johnson plays the part of Peter Corrigan , the time traveller , and upon discovering that he has been somehow transported back to the exact day of Lincoln's assassination , he manages to get himself thrown in prison , but luckily for him John Wilkes Booth , for some reason , just happened to be hanging out at the police station and overheard the frantic Corrigan desperately trying to describe the very assassination that Booth was planning for that night . Booth requests custody of Corrigan for some psychiatric experimentation , and the police officer sees nothing wrong with relinquishing custody to this guy . He had a business card , after all , how bad could he be ? The show seems to suggest that you can change people's lives by slightly altering events in the past through time travel , and while I'm not willing to accept that time travel would include such limitations , it's still a fun episode that really makes you think , which is one of my favorite qualities of the good twilight zone shows . . .
544719	562732	5489	8.0	Charlie struggling to get a job in the movies ?	There is something uniquely charming about the short comedies that Chaplin made that poke fun at his art form or that show us a little bit of the mechanics of how these movies are made . The most notable example other than His New Job is the charming and fun Behind the Screen , although this film is a lot of fun , too . It starts out in the waiting room , apparently for the opportunity to interview for a job as a film extra . He immediately begins flirting with a woman in the room , and soon does the old hat gag where someone demands that he take it off but he keeps putting it back on , finally doing that cute trick where he flips it up in the air . I feel like I've seen him do that in at least four or five films , although I have to say that he does it best in The Immigrant . It seems that the characterization is getting pretty developed by this point , and that the little tramp has earned a good following of fans who want to see him in each new Chaplin film . There is less and less effort put into giving him a role in each film , he generally just comes out and plays himself . There are lots of traditional Chaplin antics in the waiting room as he competes for the film extra position , although when he finally gets into the interview room and blows into that earpiece , it might be the first time I've literally laughed out loud at one of these short comedies in quite a while . Charlie is dressed as a soldier for his part in the film within the film , although as is to be expected , things soon go wrong and his lack of acting talent becomes abundantly clear . I always find it a little amusing when actors play roles in which , at some point , they lament the fact that they have no acting talent . But my favorite part of the film is that it shows us behind the scenes , what some of the film sets looked like back in 1915 . I always find it fascinating when I catch a glimpse of something real in these old movies , even if it's something tiny , like wafting smoke or the unintentional movement of curtains or a throw rug . It is endlessly fascinating to me to imagine what it was like to really be there , what the set looked like to the naked eye , in real life and in color . Here , we are treated to some shots of the inside of the soundstage , which I guess is the next best thing . Generally , the movie is clever and fun , but other than some interesting behind the scenes shots there's really nothing new here . The ending is even a little violent , but this is still one of the more fun of Chaplin's earliest work .
544013	562732	84602	8.0	Why so serious ?	Like Part 2 , Rocky 3 starts off where the last movie left off , but things are totally different now . Rocky has the feel of a real person with a real , three dimensional life by now , but he's come a long way from the Rocky we knew in the first two movies . Most notably , he's RICH now . He has a genuine career going in full swing in boxing by now , and the first part of the movie is a montage of event fights , all of which he wins soundly and comfortably . He is a tremendous champion with 10 successful title defense fights and a whole list of corporate sponsors . Not surprisingly , he begins to feel overconfident and a little lazy . There is some ham-handed foreshadowing as we see clips of a concerned Mr . T in the audience at Rocky's fights , and it's not long before Clubber Lang ( Mr . T ) begins publicly insulting Rocky , challenging him to a fight and taunting him at press conferences . I'm curious about where Lang's anger comes from . He is clearly furious with Rocky , but we know nothing about him . We don't know anything about his past as a fighter other than what is passed on through dialogue , and the unsolved mystery surrounding his uncontrollable rage is probably the movie's only genuine fault . The important thing that we are told is that Lang is not a boxer , like Rocky , but a wrestler , so it's a completely different , ah , ball game this time . There is an interesting fight that Rocky has midway through the movie with a hulking giant ( Hulk Hogan ) curiously named " Thunderlips , " in an illustration of what had become of his career . He had reached such a level of success that his fights became little more than performances put on to generate ticket sales , but Rocky's humanitarianism shows through , as he sometimes donates all proceeds , as in the case of the fight with Thunderlips , to various charities . But as always , Rocky maintains his laid back demeanor , letting the insults and taunts roll off his back , which is one of the qualities that has really allowed him to win so many hearts . But at an outdoor press conference , Lang taunts Rocky's wife , and he gets genuinely angry for the first time in the first three movies , other than the sudden tantrum he had in the first film when Mickey first asked to be his manager . After this , everything starts to fall apart . It turns out that his championship is not what he thought it was , and he is put into a position where he has to defend his wife's honor as well as his own , and to do that he has to fight a fighter that no one , including himself , really believes he can beat . True to his form , Mickey tells him , " This guy'll kill you to death inside of three rounds ! " And there is no mistake to be made about that . Lang is absolutely a KILLER . This guy has no interest in getting a knockout , he doesn't even seem that interested in being recognized as the real champion , he just wants to hurt Rocky . Essentially Lang's role in the movie is to knock Rocky out of the rut of complacency that he has gotten into . Thunderlips was billed as nearly 7 feet tall and 390 pounds , which I think it roughly twice Rocky's size , and is clearly a wrestler and not a fighter , and yet Rocky was able to win a fight with him , so it's no surprise that he assumed the fight with Lang would be about the same . When they finally fight , Lang walks all over him , and Rocky realizes that he has gotten soft . Apollo Creed , by the way , is now a sportscaster , and becomes Rocky's trainer when they learn how tough Lang really is . The movie loses track a little when Apollo starts training Rocky like he's never been in a gym before , like he's a complete amateur . Yeah , he hasn't been losing much lately , but does that mean he hasn't set foot inside a gym in all those years ? Doubtful , but nevertheless , it's great to see Rocky whipping himself back into shape and once again becoming that hardened hero that we have come to love . Although I have to admit , I loved the swimming scene . Rocky swims like my grandmother ! There is one moment of almost unforgivable cheese when Rocky and Mickey have a heart to heart on the beach at sunset in which , for example , Rocky claims that he's really afraid for the first time in his life . Isn't that a direct quote from the first movie ? There is notably more anger in part three than either of the previous movies , and while a second sequel runs a high likelihood of being the one that marks the first really noticeable turn downwards in the quality of the series ( hear that , Terminator ? ) , this one is no less watchable than the first two and , amazingly , neither is part 4 . Well done ! By the way , it's interesting that , at one point , a sportscaster notes just before a major fight , " The odds of Rocky making a comeback at 34 are long indeed ! " Yeah , how about at 60 ?
544795	562732	21165	8.0	Art imitating life imitating art .	In an early depiction of Hitchcock's fear and mistrust of the police and the legal system , we have a very legal thriller about a murder and it's subsequent trial . We are given the facts of the case , even a sort of a limited view of the murder itself taking place , followed by the prosecution and defense presenting their cases at the trial and a detailed look at the jury's discussion of the case . Sort of Hitchcock's version of 12 Angry Men . There is a curious cast of characters involved in the film , and two of Hitch's biggest interests , the law and the arts , are on center stage . Sir John in the single character who takes the time to really look deeply into what really happened that night , even though someone's life is on the line based on the verdict that they reach , and his personal investigation is probably the best part of the film . One of the things that this movie is famous for is for being the first film where someone's thoughts are shown in a film , in the scene where he is looking at himself in the mirror , shaving . For this scene , a recording of him speaking was played off screen , since vocals could not be added to the film later . There is a scene in the film where Mr . Marlowe goes to visit Sir John at his request , and as he approaches Sir John's desk there is a close up of his feet , which sink deeply into the rug as though it were laid over a soft mattress . This is never explained , although I am willing to accept that this is a spot of symbolism the meaning of which escaped me , since so much of the rest of the film is deeply layered , literally and figuratively , as well . There is an astonishing amount of technique and content to be seen here , impossible to catch all in one viewing , which is one sign of a great film . Some editing and filming techniques I suspect were not as successful as they seemed in the writing stages , but the film is strong nonetheless . Consider , for example , the brave and highly successful technique of lingering on the empty jury room while the verdict is read offstage , and the shockingly effective technique of having the face of the victim hanging in the vision of the murderer . Incredibly , I think this is one of the single most haunting shots I have ever seen in a Hitchcock film . It has its slow moments and may be a bit longer than it's content can support , but this is a brilliant example of Hitch's early work . Also keep your eye out for Hitchcock's cameo , which is a full hour into the film . This was long before he began putting all of his cameos in the beginnings of his films , knowing that the audience would be watching for him and not wanting this to distract from the stories .
544431	562732	734618	9.0	Philosophy 101 - Serling style .	There are times when I start thinking about strange possibilities and different experiences of existence , such as whether people with different eye colors see the world exactly the same way . Really , if blue eyed people experienced colors one way and brown eyed people experienced them another way , we would really have no way of knowing , because everything would look normal to everyone . That's a rather childish example , but when I start feeling existential I sometimes wonder if we are all part of someone's imagination or if we are some tiny part of an unimaginably bigger world . The religious implications here are pretty obvious , but Shadow Play has nothing to do with them . The idea that we are all just figments of someone's ( or something's ? ) imagination is not a new proposal , of course , but Serling has taken the premise and turned it into a pretty entertaining half hour story . Dreams and their meanings is an almost endlessly fascinating subject , and has been explored extensively in the annals of psychology , as well as in film , television , and literature . Wes Craven blurred the lines between reality and nightmare in his Nightmare on Elm Street films , and long before that , Serling explored the causes and effects of recurring nightmares more than once here on the outskirts of the Twilight Zone . It doesn't seem that the show is really seeking any answers , but is instead just presenting a situation in which a man is having recurring nightmares in which he has been sentenced to death , and is basically trying to convince the people around him to help themselves by helping him . It is a brilliantly ironclad dilemma he is in . Imagine being on death row and trying to convince the guards and police around you that if they go through with your execution , they will all disappear . " You're all in my imagination ! If you execute me you'll cease to exist ! " The feeling of helplessness that he must be suffering is unimaginable ! Granted , I've had dreams where I sank like a rock to the bottom of the ocean or fell off a building or something , and I always wake up at the point of death , and while it's scary , it's also an enormous relief when I wake up and realize I'm safe in my bed . Still , the nightly anticipation of electrocution's gotta make it hard to get to sleep at night . Although personally , rather than trying to convince the guards to cancel my execution , I would just stick my arm through the bars of my cell and say - " Come on , pinch me ! See what happens ! "
544518	562732	290334	9.0	Well , they're definitely united ?	The original X-Men was a cool action movie with great special effects , excellent characters , awesome fight scenes , and , my personal favorite , some highly effective comic relief . Consider , for example , some of the stuff in the first film , such as the scene where Wolverine proves to Cyclops that he's really himself and not Mystique disguising herself as him , or when he tells Cyclops that someone else is in the room with them and to ' keep his eye open . ' Classic stuff , and as was the case in the original movie , the comic relief in the follow-up is great , and most of it comes from Wolverine . It's interesting to consider the fact that the movie tends to try to satisfy both its evolutionist audience as well as its creationist audience ( the latter of which obviously makes up a considerably smaller portion of the audience ) . Nightcrawler is a great character , although after the opening fight scene ( arguably the best scene in the entire film ) he changes into a completely different character almost immediately . I was looking forward to seeing him as a wonderfully effective villain ( at this point I'd like to remind you that I am not familiar with the X-Men comics and so don't know a lot about the characters beyond what's in the movies ) . I even loved the sound effects that were made when he would disappear and reappear somewhere else . It was strange that he kicked so much ass in the opening scene and then turned out to be completely timid . Besides being an interesting character , Nightcrawler is the one in which the majority of the faith-based content of the movie is concentrated . It is well known that evolution is based entirely on observable facts and is totally open to change when new revelations and discoveries are made , while creationism is based entirely on faith ( and , it might as well be noted , on ignoring observable facts ) . It's interesting to watch as the movie tends to switch back and forth between the two , seeming at first to be almost a fight for screen time by screenwriters of different ideologies but turning out to be a revelation that faith and evolution are not opposites , but can work together . Evolution is a fact , we KNOW that it is true , and X-Men takes the formula and uses it to make a great action movie . The dangerous line that it walks is that is provides creationists , people who are notorious for taking evolutionary theory and mutilating and distorting it completely beyond recognition in a desperate attempt to make it look ridiculous . It is not going to be any surprise to see hordes of creationists who will latch on to something like X-Men and accuse evolutionists of thinking that X-Men is some sort of documentary-style , non-fiction account of the generally accepted current state of human ' evolution . ' I would like to take this opportunity to laugh in advance . It should be obvious that this is a movie made for entertainment purposes , even if only by the fact that not all of the ' mutants ' are , in fact , mutants . Wolverine , for example , was created by a human ( not a God , by the way ) , as was his worthy adversary near the end of the film . But as far as taking enormous liberties with evolutionary theory , it should be noted that the movie also makes extensive efforts to clarify the way that evolution really works , although it leaves out the small detail that the X-Men are a massive exaggeration . In comparison with the original movie , X2 was a hugely entertaining and well-made action film , just like X1 , but it is the story that has evolved more than anything else . I loved the introduction of a new bad guy who forced the X-Men to come together , although the movie did tend to trip over itself at some points , such as with the paper-thin content of the meaning and need for the little boy with the freaky tongue . ( spoilers ) I was disappointed with the fate of Jean Grey , even if only because her ' death ' was so avoidable . It was never explained very clearly why she didn't stay on the jet and use all of her energy to lift the jet itself out of the path of the oncoming water instead of getting off and trying to levitate the jet while stopping the water at the same time . Even if exiting the jet was absolutely necessary , there is really no fathomable reason why , given the fact that she held the water back that long and was ultimately able to stop her efforts at lifting the jet , she could not let the water gradually come to her and slowly engulf her so that she could swim and wait for the jet to come back and pick her up . At any rate , if her death was necessary for furthering the story or for preparing for the next film ( the creation of a third X-Men is an absolute certainty , after all ) , then I suppose I can understand it , but making Jean's death necessary and making it believable are two of the weakest parts of the film . On the positive side , however , Hugh Jackman was given the opportunity to prove his effectiveness in performing emotionally charged scenes while playing a comic book character ( which is certainly a daunting task ) . Speaking of weak parts of the film , by the way , there is also Magneto's escape . Not only does Mystique inject a massive amount of ' iron ' into the body of one of Magneto's prison guards without killing him ( there are VERY few things that can be injected directly into the blood stream in that quantity without resulting in almost immediate death , and iron in ANY form is NOT one of them ) , but Magneto also manages to latch on to all of that iron and pull it out of the guard's body , using the nice little ball-bearings that he gets out of him to escape . However , even the most basically educated members of the audience , who realize that the iron in your blood is not exactly metal , will probably appreciate the way this was pulled off ( that is , of course , if they were able to see the screen enough while repeatedly slapping their foreheads in disbelief ) . I have never been into comic books , I don't think I've ever even seen a copy of an X-Men comic , but even coming into the films completely new like that I enjoyed both of them and I think they were both remarkably well-made . It is a sign of deserving respect when a movie or series of movies based on comics books or cartoons or old TV shows or something can entertain an audience that is not familiar with the original material ( this is not true for example , according to Roger Ebert , of the recent Scooby-Doo film , which I have yet to see or develop any interest in seeing ) . With that in mind , I think it would be appropriate to end by emphasizing the sheer broadness of the target audience . Kids will love the characters and the fighting and special effects , high school and college age kids will appreciate the same things as well as the intricacy of the story ( adults will more than likely appreciate this as well ) , and , as was the case with the first film , just about every male in the audience of any age and sexual orientation will appreciate the astronomical hotness of Mystique , which translated from the first film to this one quite well . I don't have much to say in defense of the little stunt that Magneto pulled in pulling the ' iron ' out of the guard's blood in order to escape , although even that was convincingly done . As with all movies , X2 has its faults , but it is definitely a worthy follow-up to the original , which was something of a tough act to follow .
543767	562732	101025	9.0	Heavily symbolic film about Spain's struggle to escape from the oppressive regime of Franco .	( spoilers ) One of the things that I really like about this film is that its message can be delivered whether you know the situation in Spain at the time or not . The nationalists win violently at the end of the film , and you know the meaning of this without even having to know many historical details about the oppression of the Franco regime at the time that the movie takes place , which is important in making this movie internationally comprehensible . Carmela is a maternal figure both for her husband Paulino as well as for the young mute boy that they have taken into their care . They are entertainers seeking to escape the violence of the war , which is coming closer and closer to their home , but ultimately end up trying to entertain the Nationalist army and thereby win their freedom . There is a great scene at the beginning of the movie where Carmela and Paulino and Gustavete are performing for the rugged , less organized Republican army ( sort of the roughnecks who have to defend themselves against the offenses of the Nationalists ) . This is a delightful performance that hugely entertains the audience , but it stops in its tracks as the sound of planes is heard overhead , and everyone in the room goes completely silent , waiting to hear the sound of bombs dropping . In this early scene , we see exactly what is going on in the film without having to have it delivered flatly through dialogue . We see the winners AND the losers in this film . The movie opens up with the performance for the Republicans , where everyone is having a good time including the performers , but by the end of the film , Carmela and Paulino and Gustavete have been captured and are nervously performing for the stolid Nationalist army , all the while terrified that they may say something wrong and offend the diminutive Franco in the front row ( who reminds me of Lord Farquaad from Shrek ) and be thrown back into prison or killed . The difference between the two armies is striking . The Republicans are clearly less organized , less trained , have less equipment , weapons , training , financial backing , etc , and most importantly , are very clearly there to defend themselves rather than wage war against the Nationalists . These are the peaceful people who are forced into a war situation by a regime that is about to attack them . The Nationalists , however , are a much more organized and well trained and funded group . They are , in fact , so organized , that the suits in the audience at the end of the film are literally color coded . The majority of the symbolism in the film is centered around Paulino , Carmela , and Gustavete . Carmela represents Spain , obviously , and her death at the end of the film represents the expiration of freedom and possibly the death of Spain itself . She tries to save everyone , worrying about the suffering of all people and therefore putting herself in danger in an effort to help them , while Paulino is much more realistic , concerned mostly with their own problems and saving themselves . He is not portrayed as selfish or as a coward , but as a realist . He knows that trying to fight against the Nationalists is simply not realistic and is a stupid way to get himself killed . Carmela died at the end of the film because she stood up against people that she had absolutely no power over . When Carmela is shot , Gustavete finally managed to get some sound out of his throat , representing a hope for the future . Carmela was killed , but Gustavete represents a new youth , and he has been given a voice by the display of violence put on by the Nationalist army , embodied in the one man who pulled the trigger . There is , however the fact that the Nationalists erupt into total confusion when things get rough at the end of the film , as well as the stunned look on the soldier's face when he realizes that he has killed Carmela , which shows that the movie is not about bad people , but about a bad ideology . The Nationalists are not portrayed as evil people , just people who made bad choices and got involved with a bad cause that did not turn out to be what they thought it was . This movie reminds me in a way of Life Is Beautiful ( as does José Luis Cuerda's Butterfly ) , except that both the tragedy as well as the comedy are each reduced in each film . This is not a film about the power of stupid people in large groups , but rather the effect that a large idea can have on impressionable people . It warns against the dangers of being weak willed and simply going with the flow , the extremes that this kind of conformity can lead to . Clearly , this is a worst case scenario , but the film had a message that crosses time , culture , and international boundaries .
544296	562732	120738	9.0	HELL yeah . This is some excellent sci-fi .	Contains spoilers Lost In Space is a tremendously upgraded adaptation of the old campy TV show , in which the Robinson family is , of course , lost in space . The film has an excellent opening battle sequence that nearly rivals anything that George Lucas has ever done and comes close to being as exciting as the opening of any of the James Bond films . It is particularly noteworthy that Matt LeBlanc was able to deliver such a convincing performance as a tremendously skilled fighter pilot , given his popularity from Friends . Lost In Space presents a pretty dismal prediction of the future . The movie takes place ( initially ) in the year 2058 , and John Robinson , the father in the famous Robinson family , has been working for years on a mission to Alpha Prime , a planet which is capable of supporting human life . It seems that in another two decades , Earth will no longer be capable of supporting human life . The wooden performance of William Hurt in the role of John Robinson takes a little getting used to , but overall , he pulls it off very well . Probably the best character in the film is Dr . Zachary Smith , the self proclaimed ' monster ' of a man that was hired to sabotage the Robinson's mission , played with flawless precision by the brilliant Gary Oldman . It turns out that he is double-crossed himself , and he winds up on the ship with the Robinsons , along with the robot that Smith re-programmed to destroy the family as well as the ship's navigation systems . Science fiction films generally have very weak and simple plots , and it was great to see that this one got interesting so fast . The thing that really causes the family to get lost in space is that they accidentally get caught in the sun's gravitational pull , and because they don't have enough power to escape it , they have to open up the stargate ( meant to traverse the tremendous distance between Earth and Alpha Prime instantaneously ) and go THROUGH the sun , thus delivering them into an unknown part of space . Lost . The trip through was a little much , but it definitely was cool , and the resulting setting that they find themselves in is just fascinating . And as if a trip to unknown space wasn't enough , they throw in a great time travel element to the story , making it that much more interesting . Almost immediately after shooting though the stargate and finding themselves lost in space , the Robinsons come across a spaceship from Earth , and in the captain's log they find a recording of an old man who says that he ' refuses to give up ' in his search for the Robinsons . Even though they had only been lost for a matter of hours , this ship had been searching for them for YEARS . While there was some highly entertaining acting in this film , not all of the characters were as well presented and acted as John Robinson and Dr . Smith and Major Don West ( LeBlanc ) . Mimi Rogers provided an effective and believable mother in the family , as well as the life sciences expert , but the high pitched Lacey Chabert , the pedophile's dream , got real annoying real quick , and Heather Graham was horribly miscast as Judy Robinson . After several of her previous roles , it would be best if she would avoid taking on a role that is to be taken seriously for quite a while . And there were a few things in the film that didn't make sense . There is the obvious problem ( that all Back To The Future fans will notice right away ) with the older Will's plan to travel back to the day they left and stop the ship from taking off - you already know that won't happen , because when they left at the beginning of the movie , Will would have shown up and told them not to leave . And how about the scene where Dr . Smith tricks Will into using his voice-print ID on his gun to ' enable for all users , ' only to have Smith turn it on him ? Wouldn't it have been just as easy for Will to use the voice ID to turn the gun off while it was pointed at him ? Seems that such a smart kid would have realized that all he had to do was talk to the gun in order to eliminate all danger . Lost In Space is also famous for its ludicrous amount of special effects and , surprisingly enough , they were very well done and very effective . Obviously , special effects are mandatory for a space movie , but they are most often screwed up so badly that they ruin the movie ( see : Mission To Mars ) . In this movie , though , the special effects have the unique distinction of being both way overdone and very effective - with the exception of that damn alien monkey that doesn't look real in a single frame in the entire film and is also totally unnecessary . The only thing that really took a lot away from the film was the transformed Dr . Smith at the end of the film . Sure , it was a cool idea that he got transformed into one of the spiders in true vampire form after having been scratched by one , but the cartoonish creature that he turned into was just too far , even for this otherwise high-quality science fiction movie . A lot of things are never clarified , like how Will ( who sure grew up to be an ugly guy ) comes up with the tools necessary to build time traveling warp zones and whatnot , but it doesn't really matter that this isn't explained . This is usually not good , but Lost In Space is an unusually well made science fiction thriller that is fun for all ages , so it can get away with a lot of stuff like that . The tremendous gap at the end of this film makes it pretty obvious that at least one sequel is inevitable , and we can only hope that any sequels live up to the original .
544310	562732	107302	9.0	One of Brad Pitt's most memorable roles .	In the same vein as Natural Born Killers , another movie that was not so popular with critics because of its excessive violence but that I also loved , Kalifornia is a movie that clearly glamorizes violence , but I like to think that it turns that around in the final act . Kind of like how The Basketball Diaries glamorizes drugs at first , but shows the bad side by the end of the movie , which is far worse than the good side is good . David Duchovny plays Brian Kessler , an artistic yuppie with an even more artistically yuppie girlfriend , who is into that violent sexy black and white photography generally reserved for , I don't know where , places where nudity passes for art . Maybe it really does and I just don't understand it . At any rate , Brian and Carrie ( Duchovny and Michelle Forbes , who fits the role flawlessly ) , make the perfect couple to go on a documentary tour of famous murder sites . Brian , the writer , will write the book , Carrie can take the pictures . Being artistic types , Brian and Carrie are not quite financially prepared for such a trip , so they put out an ad for someone to share gas and travel expenses , and are contacted by Early Grace and Adele Corners ( Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis ) . Early is on parole and assigned to janitorial work at the local university by his parole officer , sees the ad on a bulletin board , and decides to leave the state for a while , violating his parole but also leaving the scene of his landlord's murder so he won't have to deal with a pesky murder investigation . Two birds with one stone , you know . The movie has a curious ability to portray two stereotypes , the artsy yuppies and the greasy trailer trash , without resorting to clichés or even ending up with caricatures of either type . Brian and Carrie are artsy liberals , but while Carrie catches on to Early and Adele , Brian is fascinated with Early's status as an outlaw , as seen in the scene where Brian shoots Early's gun . Never having fired a gun before , he's as fascinated as a little kid . While Adele and Carrie are back at a hotel and Adele reveals such things in her childlike way as the fact that Early " broke her " of smoking and that she's not allowed to drink ( Early doesn't think women should ) , Early and Brian are out at the local bar . Brian reacts nervously to a drunk trying to start a fight with him , and Early first gives advice to Brian on what to do and then steps in and dishes out a quick lesson for the guy . " Hit him , Bri , it's comin ' . " This is one of my favorite scenes in the movie , partly because it's so funny what Early gleefully says as the guy's friends drag him away , bloodied and battered , but also because as it is intercut with the girls back at the hotel , we learn so much all at once about the two couples , their differences , and the conflicts that are likely to come up because of them . And besides that , because Brian benefited from Early's actions and Carrie is appalled by what she hears from Adele , it also illustrates the different way that Carrie and Brian react to Early and Adele . Clearly , by now , you can tell that this is not your typical odd couple type of thriller , where the city folk run into the country folk and all sorts of stereotypical mayhem ensues . On one hand it seems a little too convenient that Brian and Carrie go on a tour of murder sites and just happen to be accompanied by a real life murderer , but on the other hand it's a great way to counteract the glorifying of murder that is inherent within a cross-country trip designed to bring fame to murderers and their crimes . While studying the actions of past murderers , Brian and Carrie ultimately find themselves face to face with the very material that they are studying , and realize that murder is not as pretty or morbidly fascinating when it's in your face as it is through disconnected studies of murders past . I am constantly amazed at Brad Pitt's versatility as an actor . Consider , for example , his roles in movies like Kalifornia , 12 Monkeys , Fight Club , and Ocean's 11 and 12 . Pitt is like Tom Hanks in that he can change his appearance drastically or just enough to fit a given character , and is completely believable . Incidentally , I tried in vain to be Early Grace for Halloween this year , but just couldn't get the hair and beard right . I even got the hat right , which initially I thought would be the hardest part . It's easy to understand why a lot of people disliked Kalifornia or why they think that it glorifies violence and murder , but I think that whatever glorifying it does is done with the intention of clarifying the audience's understanding of its subject matter . A film that didn't glorify violence , at least initially , could never be as effective as Kalifornia , but the movie structures it perfectly . The glorification is all embodied in Brian's and Carrie's fascination with the idea of murder and the auras of the places in which is happened , but their realization , and ours , is embodied in the real thing , which they encounter with Early and Adele . The movie's very purpose is to describe that difference between idealizing violence and seeing the horror of it up close and for real .
544081	562732	111161	9.0	Every once in a long while a truly inspiring film comes along that is a must see for virtually everyone . The Shawshank Redemption is one of these films .	Every single scene in The Shawshank Redemption , every bit of dialogue , everything that happens all beautifully serves the purpose of intensifying the impact of the story itself . The muted colors and the relaxed cinematography do a spectacular job of taking us back in time , and the message of the film is inspiring , to say the least . What you have in the Shawshank Redemption is a film that is extremely well thought-out and put together in such a way that it is able to hold your attention even for well over two hours . The movie is about holding on to hope in even the worst circumstances , even under tremendous stress , and even when you are in that situation unjustly . However , even though Andy Dufresne is clearly the protagonist , Red is actually a more important person as far as the message of the film . He seems to embody the lessons learned in the film , and this is shown in the way that his life is transformed by his friendship with Andy . However , there were a few things about this film that I didn't like that I think took a lot away from it . For example , even though I admit that it didn't reduce the potency of the film itself , everything worked out a little too perfectly for Andy in prison . Sure , he got beaten up and sexually assaulted , but look at the aftermath of those attacks . When the " Sisters " beat him within an inch of his life , did he get his nose broken ? Was he left with any scars ? Were any of his limbs casted ? Did he even develop a limp ? No , what happened was he spent a month in the infirmary and got out with his hair messed up . That's a pretty small price to pay for almost being beaten to death . I also find it hard to believe that every single guard in the prison , including the warden , would allow a prisoner to do their taxes . Sure , he's got expertise in the banking field , but he's also been convicted of murder . I would think that the warden in particular , with all of his , ahem , activities , would want to kind of keep to himself as far as his finances . Another problem was the timeline . We see events that take place over long periods of time , but we are largely left to speculate about what goes on in the years that are skipped over . The film comes together as a great story , but you have to keep in mind that in between scenes that seem to run together , YEARS have gone by . The aging process wasn't done very well either . All of the characters involved looked almost exactly the same at the beginning of the movie as they did at the end . When that many years have passed , something needs to be done to try to make the actors look at least a little bit older . Aside from these minor deficiencies , as well as a confusing title , The Shawshank Redemption is an absolutely incredible film . The setbacks can be overlooked because of the fact that the film as a whole communicates such an important and powerful message , and the film is not boring even for a second . It's intense , it's beautifully made , and it will not soon be forgotten .
543780	562732	96244	9.0	A modern day film noir .	Michelle Pfeiffer , Mel Gibson , and Kurt Russell are the three corners of the love triangle that makes up a significant part of the plot in this tense thriller . Gibson plays Mac , a legendary drug dealer who is trying to get out of the drug business but finds that no one wants him to leave , not even the police . Russell plays the part of the detective who is hot on Mac's trail but is reluctant to capture and charge him because the two men were childhood friends , and Pfeiffer is the beautiful restaurant owner who is torn by her feelings for the two men . The thing that really causes this otherwise unoriginal story to keep up a brisk pace is the question of what everyone's individual intentions are , who knows what , and who told what to whom . Tequila Sunrise is full of effective plot twists that sometimes twist right back to the way they were , even at the strangest times ( such as in the boat near the end of the film ) . ( spoilers ) Jerry Bruckheimer and Company could take a serious lesson in making romantic subplots work in action films from Tequila Sunrise , in which Gibson and Pfeiffer eventually develop a very effective relationship with each other . The most moving scene involving this element of the film takes place when Mac is telling her about his reasons for teaching his lawyer ( who is also her lawyer ) to sell drugs . This has a lot to do with both of their skills as actors , because I've already seen Mel do this several times in the hardcore action Lethal Weapon series , and Michelle is so beautiful that she can do anything she wants . Tequila Sunrise is a heavily atmospheric film reminiscent of other modern classic films noir , such as the stiflingly atmospheric Body Heat , and much of the effect is the same . Kurt Russell is the stereotypical male in a film noir , with the slicked back hair , the nice suit , and the ever-present cigarette . Michelle Pfeiffer would fulfill the traditional femme fatale role very nicely , especially given her attractiveness as well as her overall physical fit of the description of the femme fatale , except that she doesn't really drag anyone down . Films noir usually end in death , for the femme fatale as well as the male victim , but Tequila Sunrise doesn't do that . This is one of the ways that the story was made to work so well , because even though you pretty much know that Mac will get the girl ( if only because he's Mel Gibson ) , it twists many other expectations around . This is a thinking person's action film , and it's a shame that these are so uncommon .
544845	562732	64757	9.0	The most unique Bond film of the entire series .	Why was George Lazenby only in one Bond film ? Sure , Lazenby is no Sean Connery ( yeah , but NONE of them are , remember ? ) , but he still did an excellent job in his only effort as the great James Bond . Of course , probably the main thing that made Lazenby so effective in the role is that he resembled Connery in so many ways . They were built the same , they had the same hair , the same eyes , they even talked a lot alike . And there can be no doubt , by the way , that this had a significant role in securing the part for Lazenby . One of the things that is unique about On Her Majesty's Secret Service , besides being the only installment that starred the man who was only in one of the films , is the excellent editing . In the opening sequence , for example , during the spectacular fight scene on the beach , there is some of the fastest and most effective editing that is seen in the entire series . And it's a good thing , too , because the opening sequence was otherwise over dramatized . For example , Bond saves a woman from drowning herself in the ocean , and after grabbing her as she waded slowly and calmly into the water , he carries her back to the beach and lays her down on the sand , inexplicably unconscious . What happened there , did she hit her head on Bond's shoulder and knock herself out ? Luckily , this pathetic discrepancy is quickly forgotten as the remainder of the scene secures itself as probably the best opening scene so far . There are dozens of unique qualities of On Her Majesty's Secret Service that really set it apart from the other Bond films . For one thing , there are no words in the theme song , which is unusual because most of them are written specifically for the respective films ( and most are absolutely awful , as well ) . And thank God , too , those theme songs are killing me . The endless flirting with Moneypenny actually proceeds to the point of a kiss here , which I believe takes place just after James resigns from the secret service , another peculiarity of this film . I could go on and on about these things that are totally uncharacteristic of a James Bond movie . There are about ten Bond girls , instead of the usual one . After having resigned , James goes through his old gadgets , some of which are recognizable from previous films , and also note the song that plays during this scene ? ' Underneath the Mango Tree , ' the same song that was playing when we were first introduced to the Beautiful Honey Ryder in Dr . No . James Bond utters the words ' I love you ' as well as ' Will you marry me . ' There are dozens of things that are different from the rest of the series . The skiing scene was actually done well , as was the car chase on the racetrack . And at one point in the film , Bond actually impersonates a man who doesn't like women ! ( spoilers ) And yes , you heard right , Bond got MARRIED ! While this may have been the one step too far in coming up with original material ( a married Bond would spell disaster for later films ) , the almost immediate death of his new bride not only creates pretty impressive emotion ( when did that ever happen in a Bond film ? ! ) , but it also begins to legitimize the promiscuity that Bond has always displayed . It made his womanizing behavior seem less adolescent and exploitive . The story of On Her Majesty's Secret Service is also fairly unique to a certain extent , but it's really still the same old thing about some super villain holding the world hostage and it's all up to Bond to save the day . But in this case , rather than the usual nuclear weapons hijack , the villain is threatening the world with bacterial warfare , or an outbreak of foot and mouth disease , to be exact . While this is indirectly destructive toward humans ( it threatens the economy rather than directly endangers peoples ' lives ) , it is still good to see something a little bit different once in a while . As this essentially normal Bond plot unfolds , we see lots of impressive stuff . Notice that the main Bond girl ( after the one-after-the-other romp with lots of them early in the film ) strangely resembles Shirley Manson , the singer for Garbage and the performer of the excellent theme song for The World Is Not Enough 30 years later , and that movie's title originates in THIS film . Weird , huh ? On Her Majesty's Secret Service is clearly one of the Bond films that really has a lot of stuff to look for , particularly if you are familiar with the other Bond films . The story itself is not exactly a point of interest by this point in the series , but the action is still very impressive and it is made even better by the amazingly well done editing . The fast paced luge scene at the end of the film is a good action sequence , as is the very convincing avalanche , but when Bond crash lands at the end of the luge scene , a big slobbery dog immediately runs up and starts licking his face , which is just entirely too convenient . They may as well have had him land in a big easy chair . Luckily , the film did not end here , but rather with the tragic death of Bond's new wife which , rather than hamper interest in Bond films to follow ( which would be the case , had he remained married ) , makes you want to rush out and watch the next one to see the killers brought to justice , Bond style ! There can be no mistake about On Her Majesty's Secret Service . This is definitely one of the best Bond films , regardless of who played the starring role . Any fan of James Bond or just quality action films is sure to love this one .
544043	562732	362590	9.0	" I got a plan , and it's just as good as God's ? "	I have to admit that after about 20 minutes of this movie I was this close to just turning it off and moving on to The Grudge , which I watched right afterwards . Man , I'm glad I didn't , though , because this movie goes from pretty boring to not so bad to pretty good to VERY good . It's odd that this film has been so completely overlooked by critics and denounced by IMDb reviewers , who either understood how well-made this movie is ( especially the script , which is brilliant ) or it went completely over their heads and they couldn't wait to log on and berate the film as a total failure . One reviewer calls the movie " the dregs , " but then again this genius also gave Memento ( probably one of the three best films released in 2000 ) a vote of , so utter cluelessness coming from this person is hardly lightning out of a clear sky for unexpectedness . Another user gave it a lukewarm response , but also called Lost In Translation a real yawner , American History X " waaaaaaaay overrated , " A . I . " the most boring movie I've ever slept through , " and the absolutely ridiculous 2003 Texas Chainsaw remake " one of the better slasher flicks " ( ! ! ) . Now , I hesitate to call this last user clueless , because he really seems like a nice guy ( I'm sure he's a good father as well ) , but his list of reviews betrays the fact that he may be wired completely backwards when it comes to movies . The Texas Chainsaw remake better than A . I . , Lost in Translation , and American History X ? ? PLEASE . Now , I normally don't go on this much about what other people have to say about any given movie . Notice that I'm not getting into the two external reviews posted for the film ( Scott Weinberg and Movie House Commentary , at the time of this writing ) , which is amazing because they are both so completely wrong that it's difficult not to elaborate on my incredulous disbelief . It's sad that when a movie comes along that is actually well-written , so many people can't resist comparing it to a similar film that came out previously , completely ignoring the new film's good qualities and simply writing it off as a rip-off . This happened a lot with the wonderful comedy Runaway Bride , about which so many people immediately said things like " You know , I've seen this movie before . . . When it was called Pretty Woman " like it just absolutely must make them the cleverest person on earth . Personally , when I see a movie that looks stupid but turns out to be a very well-made thriller ( like Wild Things ) , I don't generally complain when a similar movie comes along , as long as it is also well-made and stands on its own , and Employee of the Month certainly does that . There are scenes in the movie that I thoroughly disliked , such as some stupid sex jokes , too much profanity , and anything involving dead people and jewelry , but Steve Zahn is great in his role , Matt Dillon gives a wonderful performance in a well-written character , and the plot twists start small and then get faster and faster and by the time they're done you're halfway through the end credits . People are really quick to criticize the twists in this movie . The twists are either too predictable or too unpredictable or there are too many of them or they're dumb or some other such nonsense . When the twists first started I was impressed by where the movie was going , because I thought it was going to be something completely different , but by the last one the movie had made very clear that many of the twists were done with tongue firmly in cheek , that you were meant to have a good time . This movie is all in good fun , and while it slips up by getting a little too vulgar for its own good from time to time , it most definitely deserves to be compared to Office Space , because it is certainly one of the great dark comedies .
543941	562732	397101	9.0	Hoodoo voodoo we do ! !	VGS fans will get that , but for everyone else I recommend just checking out this movie . I rented The Skeleton Key mostly because for the last few months I have been trying to watch every movie that comes out . Netflix has provided me with the opportunity of just adding all the new movies to my queue and not having to try and remember all of the movies that I've missed , which I always did before , given the constant barrage of new releases . I know I'll never catch up ( my Netflix queue is approaching the 300 mark ) , but it's at times like this that I'm glad that I try to watch all of the movies that come out ( Hellraiser 8 left me with a different sentiment entirely ) . One of the first things that struck me about The Skeleton Key was that it is a great horror movie to take a date to see . It focuses on creating a solid story and building tension rather than blood and gore , which with rare exceptions is how the best horror films are made anyway . Kate Hudson plays Caroline , an aspiring nurse who quits her job at a hospital because of their intolerable lack of concern over deaths , she doesn't feel right about working at a hospital that sees their patients as so much of a business and has little humane interest in them . When a patient passes away and is whisked away with the trash she decides she's had enough and starts combing the classifieds for something a little more personal . She finds a job as a live-in caregiver for a woman and her husband , who has suffered a massive stroke that affected both sides of his body , and it's not long before we learn that Caroline herself lost her father , so suddenly , in fact , that she was unable to help care for him at the end of his life , hence her overwhelming determination to provide the best care possible . Caroline is given a skeleton key that will open every door in the house , but when she finds one door hidden in the attic that the key doesn't open , obviously it takes on the most intrigue of all of the rooms in the house . There is a lot of stuff about voodoo and cults in the movie , and while it is really the backbone of the film it is not what makes it good . The movie is good because it has history behind it . It takes its time in getting started , but that's important because it takes the time necessary to tell the story behind what goes on in the movie . And probably most importantly , in my opinion , is that the movie was filmed on an old plantation house in Louisiana that actually housed well over a hundred slaves , which not only adds intrigue but relevance as well . There's a point about three quarters of the way through the movie that it seems that it's going to pan out in a pretty predictable way , but there's a great twist near the end that , while it is certainly a turn away from what may have been expected , it also has the enviable quality of giving the impression that the movie had to go that way all along , which is one of the first lessons I learned about storytelling back in college , that a good story cannot be predictable , yet the ending has to seem perfectly natural , that it could only have ended the way it did . And while this movie could certainly have ended in other ways , it wouldn't have been as good as it is if it had ended any other way . Also make sure to check out the surprising number of extra features on the DVD , particularly John Hurt's story and the story of the house in which the movie was filmed .
544607	562732	181689	9.0	In the world of the blind , the one-eyed man is king ?	This is spoken in Minority Report by a drug-dealer on the streets with no eyes at all , so I suppose its free advice for John Anderton , our hero , or a bit of wise-sounding advice meant to get across to the audience but with no other good place for it to fit in the film . This is fine with me , too , because Minority Report is such a taut futuristic thriller that an incongruous little bit of wisdom like this is not to have any negative impact on the film as a whole . John Anderton , played with precision by the great Tom Cruise ( oh shut up , the man's awesome ) , is the chief of the Pre-Crime department in the District of Columbia , which has successfully eradicated murder entirely for the last six years . He works with a group of ' pre-cogs ' that , together , dream of murders that have not yet taken place and project enough information for Anderton and his team to watch the video emanating from their heads to determine where and when the murders are to take place and to get to those locations and stop the murders from happening before they happen . This is obviously a formula for a highly successful action movie , but the thing that really makes Minority Report succeed is that it pays so much amount of attention to things that would occur in this situation in real life . It is explained very early in the film that the invention of Pre-Crime has eradicated premeditated murder , as this is most easily detected by the pre-cogs . The majority of the ' business , ' then , of the Pre-Crime division in the District of Columbia , are crimes of passion . This not only provides the possibility of a lot more tension in that these crimes leave a lot less time for prevention , but also avoids complicating the plot with the details of premeditated murders . We don't care about a guy who wronged another guy five years ago or drug deals gone bad , all we need to hear about are a guy who comes home to find his wife in bed with another man and loses control . Given the fact that the movie involves some sort of time-travel ( even if information is the only thing traveling through time ) , it leaves itself open to criticism about plot holes . This is obvious , because plot holes like this even permeated the unparalleled Back to the Future series , which obviously had plenty of plot holes but handled them spectacularly well . Given the amount of movies that I have seen that involve time travel , I have come up with this equation : Time Travel = Plot Holes . This is a universal equation that is never escaped , but it does not mean that any movie that involves time travel will be brought down by the subsequent and unavoidable plot holes . Minority Report did not suffer from its necessary plot holes and neither did the timeless Back to the Future series ( which has FINALLY been released as a complete set and which no respectable movie collection could possibly be without ) . My esteemed colleague and close friend Christopher Brown ( see his brilliant reviews at http us imdb com CommentsAuthor 625436 ) points out one of these plot holes in his review of Minority Report , but makes the mistake of suggesting that , given the nature of the precognition and of the crime itself , Anderton's murder should never have been predicted since it did not entail premeditation . Sorry , Chris , but you've missed the boat on this one . The only thing that this does is bring up the fact that it's impossible to tell where precognition starts . It could be argued perfectly well that the pre-cogs played a part in their own precognition . They predicted that Anderton would commit the murder under the circumstances that he would have been watching the thoughts of the pre-cogs and seen that he would commit murder , and then obviously sought to find out for himself how he could have been expected to commit a murder against a person he has never heard of . In this case , if he had called in sick that day , all of this would have been avoided . But he's the best at what he does , he has personal reasons for wanting to stop murder , he does not slack off , he does not call in sick . John Anderton was predicted by the pre-cogs to commit murder because he was at work that day . The action in the film comes from the possibility that the whole prediction of Anderton's murder might be what is called a ' minority report , ' where the pre-cogs disagree on something that is going to happen . If he can prove that only one of the pre-cogs came up with the vision that he was going to commit a murder , it might cancel out the entire prediction because it is unreliable . On the way to this goal , we are presented with everything from a tremendously dedicated investigator ( played brilliantly by Colin Farrell ) to some amazingly creepy but strangely accepted identification spiders that scan John's implanted eye in one of the more uncomfortable scenes in the film . Minority Report is one of the best and most unique thrillers to be released in years . It is the conglomeration of such a dizzying array of films that it is difficult to contemplate them all at once . We see elements of action films , futuristic thrillers , crime films , science fiction , and of course , the influence of Stanley Kubrick is never far off . There is even , especially in the later portion of the film , a heavy influence on the soundtrack by Bernard Herrman , who was the composer for most of Alfred Hitchcock's films , among many others . It's always nice to see such a respectful homage like that , and it is only one of the many things that makes Minority Report yet another addition to Steven Spielberg's extensive list of high-end films ( the last of which was the spectacular A . I . ) . The only thing I can think of that holds Minority Report back from joining Spielberg's list of timeless classics is that it does not have the scope as far as its target audience as such films as E . T . and Jurassic Park . However , despite not having quite as large of a target audience , Minority Report stands as a strong entry in Spielberg's growing list of great films .
543996	562732	813999	9.0	Fascinating short film .	It is easy to see Neill Blomkamp's directorial skills in this short film , which runs kind of like a news broadcast documentary that gives a peek into the frightening situation in a South African town after some not so pleasant aliens have set up permanent residence there . It is a kind of journalistically objective look at how the lives of the local townspeople have been altered , mostly for the worse , by the arrival of the aliens . Visually , it is a stunningly effective film , especially with the mother ships floating just over the skyline , and the film is packed with one unsettling image after another . Having been signed on by Peter Jackson to film the highly anticipated screen adaptation of the wildly popular video game Halo , it is easy to see from this film why he was chosen despite having almost no directing experience at all to take on what will surely be a hugely popular film .
543869	562732	51207	9.0	Bare bones Hitchcock .	I think pretty much every lesser known Hitchcock film has a whole society of people who call it " one of Hitchcock's great unsung masterpieces , " and The Wrong Man is no different . The wrong man theme is one of Hitchcock's favorites and he has used it a great many times to create some of his most suspenseful films , and he uses that and almost nothing else to create the considerable suspense in this film . Hitchcock had a genuine fear of the police , and you can see it in many of his films , this one more than most . Henry Fonda delivers a wonderful performance as a regular man who just wants to be a good man and a good husband , but suddenly finds himself embroiled in this case of mistaken identity . The film is structured differently from a lot of his other films , which often showed a man forced into isolation by misplaced accusations , only to slowly reveal himself to be a hero and gradually get the girl , who paid him no attention at the beginning of the film . ( spoilers ) In this film , Christopher Balestrero ( Henry Fonda ) is never a hero nor does he try to be , and his wife not only does not gradually grow more and more fond of him despite the accusations against him , but she grows more and more distant due to the accusations . Hitchcock personally introduces the film in his only speaking role in any of his movies ( he introduced his television series episodes , but mostly as comic relief ) , and warns that the movie is completely true and absolutely frightening . It is a successful adaptation of a true story , although clearly highly polished to satisfy the studio . Definitely one of Hitchcock's more notable efforts .
544309	562732	144120	9.0	I'll be back . I always come back !	In the world of horror movie sequels , movie monsters having children is one of the biggest clichés in the book . But movie monsters having brides ? THAT'S never been done before ! ! Oh , wait . Yes it has . Luckily , the Child's Play films reside on this odd plane of existence that separates them from other horror movies while still allowing horrible things to happen in them . It's that world between comedy and horror where the movies can be a little bit of both and , most paradoxically , the expectations for quality are low but , for fun , very high indeed . At the end of Child's Play 3 , my least favorite in the entire series , Chucky suffers a fate that lands him in a police evidence locker in what is most accurately described as an extensive state of disrepair . But coming to the rescue is Tiffany , his true love in the human form and something of a knee-weakening sexpot . She bribes a cop at the beginning of the movie to steal Chucky from police lockup since , being a true romantic , she is still in love with her Charles , even if he is dead and plastic . This is one of my favorite scenes in the movie , because inside the evidence locker are items from various other unexplained multiple murders ? Michael Meyers ' and Jason's masks , Freddy's claws , and Texas ' chainsaw . Being the first film in the series that heads in a genuinely misogynistic direction , it's not long after Tiff brings Chucky back to life that he kills her , although he still doesn't manage to get her to stop loving him . The love of the abused dies hard , I suppose . This does , however , lead to some of the best scenes in the movie , as Chucky transforms from the one-dimensional murderous doll that we know and love from the previous three films and into a murderous plastic husband . One of the movie's many highlights is when Jesse and Jade use stereotypical domestic expectations to turn Chucky and Tiff against each other and get them to fight . ( ' She's not much in the housecleaning department , is she Chucky ? ' ' You cooked , the least he could do is wash the dishes , right ? ' ) . I love how the movie starts off . Jesse and Jade are high school sweethearts conspiring to run away together , but matters are complicated by her uncle , who happens to be chief of police and no big fan of boys sniffing around his daughter . Chucky and Tiff , as seems to be common in horror movies that contain the number 4 or higher in their title , have a scene in which they discuss the originality of their methods of distributing death . John Ritter has a great scene where they lined up nails on the dashboard and then somehow set off the air bag , filling his face with nails . Chucky looks at him and says , ' Why does that look so familiar ? ' Looks like he wasn't so original after all ! Charles Lee Ray's body was buried with an amulet around his neck that they now need in order to escape these wretched bodies . Tiff hires Jesse to bring them to her friend in New Jersey ( over the phone he can't tell she's a doll ) , so they can get to his grave . Thus you have two murderous dolls being transported by two teenagers who themselves don't even know they're alive , and now the police are in hot pursuit because of the trail of bodies and missing police chiefs being left in their wake . As if Jade's nosy uncle wasn't enough ? ( spoilers ) At the end of the film we are left , as is generally the case , with an ending the leaves the door open for a sequel . That requires one , really . It is strange that a single detective ultimately catches up with Jesse and Jade once they finally get to Charles Lee Ray's grave in New Jersey , and stranger still that , as we learn in Part 5 , a trashy British ventriloquist wanders onto the scene to remove the slimy , bloody baby before any more officers arrive , but the movie is so much fun that it's easy to overlook that . Bride of Chucky barely even sets out to be a horror movie as much as a curious , bloody comedy , so I think a little lapse of judgment is allowed here and there . Bride of Chucky is something of a deviation from the movies that came before it . The same main themes are there , but they have transcended the storyline that allows for all sorts of homages to be paid . Scariness is sacrificed , but quality and fun are not .
544069	562732	189998	9.0	Not for all tastes , but for anyone who is into classic horror films , or filmmaking in general , this is a must see .	( spoilers ) John Malkovich delivers an excellent performance as F . W . Murnau , the director of the classic vampire film Nosferatu . The most impressive thing about this film , in my opinion , is the way that that vampire was brought back to life . Willem Dafoe played , with nearly flawless accuracy , Max Schreck , the actor who played the part of the vampire in 1922 when Nosferatu was filmed . This is an amazing performance because it is so complex , although at times Dafoe overacted a bit . I'm always impressed when people play roles in which they portray someone else who is also playing a role . Jim Carrey , for example , did this in Man on the Moon , as well as on an episode of the Conan O'Brien show , in which he played O'Brien playing Carrey . In that show , Carrey played a comedian impersonating a comedian impersonating a comedian ( himself ) . In Shadow of the Vampire , Dafoe does this as well ; he plays the part of a vampire impersonating a person impersonating a vampire . Shadow of the Vampire is about the making of Nosferatu , except that there is the small addition that Max Schreck is a vampire in real life , and the reason that he would only ever appear on the set in full make-up is because that's what he really looked like , he really was Nosferatu . It's not hard to see how this story was realized , because not only is it true that Schreck would only appear in full make-up , but this was also the only film that he ever appeared in . I think that this is one of the things that makes this such an interesting film , because it is filmed and presented in a way that relates directly to real life , making the supernatural element of it much more effective . Malkovich and Dafoe have excellent chemistry on screen as the director and the star of Nosferatu , and this relationship is made even more interesting when it becomes clear that Schreck really is Nosferatu , that it's not just an act , and that Murnau knows about it . The way that Murnau tries to keep this a secret , even at the cost of the lives of members of his crew , suggests a tremendous dedication to the making of the film , which is now hailed as a milestone in cinematic history . People who are not interested in the history of film or filmmaking or horror classics are likely to be bored and ultimately disappointed by Shadow of the Vampire . But if it is viewed with an open mind , this is a really good movie . It not only presents an interesting story - that of the making of a vampire film in which the vampire is portrayed by a real vampire ? but it also has strong ties to reality , a quality that is extremely rare among horror films . With the right state of mind , I think that almost anyone could enjoy this film .
544053	562732	44453	9.0	Similar to his film from the year before , Una Mujer sin Amor , Luis Bunuel presents a story not about a woman who gets into a relationship with a man who doesn't respect her , but a woman who gets into a relat	The film starts off with a rich landlord's attempt to evict a lot of poor people from a low-income apartment building that he owns , and they rebel against him , threatening him with violence should he go through with the eviction . There is a great scene where we see the landlord's wife showing him that in order to calm down all those people , all that he has to do is get rid of the strong ones that keep starting the trouble . There's a great bit of symbolism here as she cuts the heads off the tallest of the flowers in her flowerpot , leaving only the crowd of smaller , weaker ones . Take out the strong ones , and the rest will subordinate . Thus the movie does not set out dealing very directly with the unenviable role in relationships that women played in the 1950s , not under Franco in Spain , but in the Mexican society in which Bunuel lived at this point in his career . Instead , the movie makes a more specific comment on the state of the union as a whole , as is suggested in the line to Don Andres ( the rich landlord who is throwing all of his poor tenants into the street ) , ' Thank you , Don Andres . You're the pride of a country without people . ' At this point in the movie , one begins to try to make ties between Don Andres and Franco , Spain's oppressive dictator at the time the film was made ( and also the reason that the movie could not have been made in Spain in 1952 ) . Franco is something of a rich and oppressive landlord himself , although the movie does not spend much time on the idea of an all-powerful and enormously wealthy landowner . As was the case in A Woman Without Love , the Brute very soon goes into the story of a woman who is constantly brought suffering by the men in her life , even if only indirectly . The movie starts off making a strong comment about the suffering of many at the hands of a small elite , and then it quickly explores an individual situation within the population . These are a typical group of poor people , and their efforts to prevent themselves from being thrown on the street and , more importantly , the efforts of their landlord to evict them , provide the conflict focused on in the rest of the film . Don Andres hires a huge man from the slaughterhouse , a man who adores him since he has been a mentor for his entire life , and the man he hires is determined to strike fear into the hearts of anyone who would dare to stand against this wonderful man . There is a lot going on here that deals with superficial impressions , since Pedro , the Brute ( played by Pedro Armendáriz , who , as an unfortunate side note , committed suicide in 1963 ) , is completely determined to help Don Andres but then changes his mind entirely once he gets close to the people that he is sent out to scare into submission . Pedro is a brute of a man , hence the title of the movie , but he faces the reality of what he is doing when he becomes close to the daughter of the man that he accidentally killed under his assignment from Don Andres . This bit of irony is the confliction of the martial law enforced by the powerful elite as it conflicts with the larger population , the humanity of which is too often overlooked . He was determined at the beginning to set the troublemakers straight , but it is not until he is forced to take shelter among them that he realizes who the real troublemakers are ( ' I may have done something wrong but I didn't know you then . ' ) . It would seem that this portion of the film presents the harshness of an authoritarian regime as misdirected and even naïve rather than inherently evil , although it is equally likely ( and , indeed , probably more so ) that it is a message to those very regimes ( specifically that of Franco ) of the reality of their form of government . Brute is a strongman for the rich elite and then ends up getting help from them and even falling in love with one of them , at which point he changes his mind , no longer wanting Don Andres to have his way and for all of these people to be evicted . He has , in effect , been separated from his brutish side by his intermingling with the very people that he was sent out to oppress . There is a great scene during the chase , by the way , that I just have to mention . At one point , when Pedro is running through the alleyways , there is a shot of him running in one direction , and his shadow , through trick lighting , clearly runs in a completely different direction , going down a different alleyway . At this point in the movie , Pedro separates from his darker side , turning toward helping the poor people that are being evicted . Just a little bit of trick lighting ( a VERY common technique in black and white filmmaking ) that really stood out to me .
544167	562732	325805	9.0	Nicholas Cage proves himself yet again .	I know that Cage's last film , Adaptation , was not as warmly accepted by everyone as it was by me , but I feel that it was one of the most intelligent and creative films to be released in a long time , and with Matchstick Men , he assumes a role in another extremely well-made and well thought-out film . I remember seeing the preview , in which Cage's character learns that he has a teenage daughter from a long dead relationship and , being a con-man , ends up being convinced by her to teach her something of his trade . At the time , I expected his character to be something more similar to his character in Snake Eyes than Adaptation - a smooth talking , fast paced kind of guy who knows what he wants and how to get it . Needless to say , it came as a surprise to see his character in Matchstick Men literally incapacitated by something as simple as someone leaving a sliding glass door open . I can kind of relate to that little quirk , in a way , because in movies , for example , when someone jumps out of a car and leaves the door open or doesn't answer a ringing phone it drives me nuts . ( spoilers ) About midway through the film , I was simply waiting for it to end . I was completely convinced that Cage was going to do one last score , his daughter would get taken hostage or something , he would have to give up his biggest payoff ever to save the life of this little girl that he just met , and he would suddenly find it within himself to give up his life of crime and start being a legitimate and loving father . Maybe he and his wife would even get back together , I was just waiting for it . Thankfully , the movie takes a completely different direction and , while I still find some of the details of the conclusion slightly hard to believe , it was great to see something so fresh and original and entertaining . There were spectacular performances in this film , the comic relief was abundant and effective , and the film never once panders to exactly what the audience wants to see . So here are the problems that I can see people having with this film . It might be seen as one of those movies that deliberately leads the audience in the wrong direction and then pops this twist on them at the end , and while that may not be completely untrue , it doesn't do it in a way that leaves you feeling cheated . Every movie with a successful twist has to lead you in the wrong direction to a certain extent , but it is whether or not it was obvious or at least cleverly crafted that makes the difference , and Matchstick Men is VERY cleverly crafted . Perhaps more pressing than the concern of leading the audience in the wrong direction , Matchstick Men does , in fact , have a problem with being a little bit too convenient . It is a very complex story , which makes it extremely entertaining , but this also gives it the feeling ( especially when the girl happens to walk into her father's work at the carpet store at the end of the film ) that everything just worked out too perfectly . Sure , deciding to buy carpet with her loser boyfriend at just the wrong carpet store is perfectly plausible , it may seem strange that she did it exactly six months after ripping him off . But of course , as always , Nicholas Cage delivers a great performance as the slightly disturbed but highly amusing Roy Waller , and Sam Rockwell draws on some of his best performances , especially his performance as Billy the Kid in The Green Mile , and takes the best parts while still adding new dimensions to his iconography . Outstanding .
544207	562732	110632	10.0	A stylistic masterpiece !	I remember being blown away when Natural Born Killers was first released , not because it was so good ( I was in high school at the time and didn't really have a good grasp on what " good " really was in a movie ) , but just by how COOL it was . As I mentioned , I was in high school at the time , so anything that glorified violence was just cool and fun to me . As I went through college I heard more and more people talk about how terrible it is , because it's all about killing and murder and bloodshed and who wants to respect a movie about those things ? But after more than ten years it has become clear that Natural Born Killers was never about violence , it is about the culture of broadcasting violence in America , about the American peoples fascination with crime , as exemplified by things like the seemingly endless O . J . Simpson trial and the L . A . riots , both of which received astonishing amounts of media coverage . Especially O . J . Simpson . My God man , I swear people at home watching TV knew more about that case than the jury . Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis are perfectly cast as Mickey and Mallory Knox , America's favorite serial killers . They travel across the country on their killing spree , but after a while you begin to notice that very little time is spent showing the killings - much more is spent on the media's and , by extension , the public's reaction . Consider , for example , Robert Downey Jr . ' s character , a journalist , jumps for joy as the killings continue , because it's such a big story . Even the law enforcement involved is clearly brimming with glee at the publicity . More than anything else , Natural Born Killers is a satire about the American appetite for violence . And when I say appetite , I don't just mean how much we can swallow , I mean how much we demand . It's all an extension of things like the O . J . Simpson trial , or even shows like Cops , which is one of my favorites , where we can all sit back in the comfort of our own homes and watch someone else on TV having their lives screwed up , whether they are innocent or guilty . It doesn't matter , as long as it's someone else ! I freely admit that I enjoy watching shows like Cops for exactly that reason . I got in trouble with the police a lot in high school so I know what a gigantic pain it is to have to deal with what comes next , and it is fun to watch it happen to other people because it reminds me of my own freedom . But Director Oliver Stone goes a step further in Natural Born Killers . The movie doesn't satirize America's acceptance of punishing criminals , we accept and glorify the actual violence , symbolized by Mickey and Mallory themselves . It turns our stomachs , but we love it . . .
544435	562732	112691	10.0	" Caught bang to rights , you were ! "	You can't really go wrong with Wallace and Gromit , and A Close Shave is no exception . The hilariously traditional Yorkshire duo are running a window-washing business that one day leads them to a wool shop run by a bizarre-looking British woman who immediately wins Wallace's heart , despite a deep sadness behind her eyes and a vicious-looking dog . It should be noted , by the way , that the makers of this short movie have succeeded in giving a claymation character deeply sad eyes . This alone might have been reason enough for why it won an Oscar for Best Animated Short Film . While Wallace follows his helplessly stolen heart , Gromit finds himself framed for a mysterious sheep-stealing and killing scheme and is thrown in prison . An adventure follows that could only exist in a Wallace and Gromit film and includes , among other things , a hilarious truck / motorcycle chase with the help of an incredibly coordinated flock of helpful sheep . Enjoy !
544347	562732	30341	10.0	One of the best of Hitchcock's earlier thrillers .	The Lady Vanishes is the last of a string of six thrillers that Hitchcock released in the 1930 , associating him with the thriller genre for the rest of his career . The film starts off with a panning shot of a less than convincing model of a town , portraying the avalanche that has trapped a whole train full of passengers in a remote hotel until the tracks can be cleared . We see a conglomeration of the typical types of people all thrown into the same place , eventually getting onto a train together after the audience has had a chance to get to know them and the situations that are to make up the rest of the film . Two businessmen ( you may recognize them as the ones that oddly showed up in my review of The 39 Steps ) are on the train and are entirely too concerned about a cricket match that they stand to miss if the train is delayed too much . They have been cut off from communications with London , and have been rendered virtually helpless because of it . A woman named Iris who is entirely too concerned with getting married runs into a spectacularly obnoxious musician who she can't seem to get away from from the moment she meets him . It's interesting to consider some of the messages that Hitchcock passes in this film through his traditional brand of cynical humor , such as the fact that a musician is introduced as horribly aggravating but ultimately turns out to be one of the heroes in the film , as well as such things like a man who serenades early in the film is strangled soon thereafter , as well as the fact that marriage is presented very early on as something that should only be done after everything else in life has already been done . ( spoilers ) Just before everyone boards the train in the morning , there is an important attempt on an old woman's life that results instead in the young brunette looking to get married getting hit on the head by a falling planter . This scene is important because it shows that there is someone out to get this old lady , and it also provides the excuse given to Iris ( the brunette ) later in the film as she tries to investigate the disappearance of the woman , who becomes her friend on the train . You would think that someone with such important information as this lady is carrying would not be such a social butterfly with a stranger on a train , but either way , the knock that Iris took on the head just before getting on the plane provides a perfect way to get her to believe that she imagined Froy ( the old woman ) when she disappears . One thing that I was a little bothered by during Iris's initial investigation was the fact that she never even thought to look on the window where Froy had written her name with her finger . They were going through a tunnel when they were introducing themselves , and the train became too noisy for Iris to be able to hear Froy's name , so Froy wrote it on the window with her finger . Because it would have been so much more normal to just wait a few seconds for the train to quiet down rather than writing on the windows , you would think that this little quirk of Froy's would have struck Iris as something to check for later when everyone is telling her that she imagined the old woman and that she was never there in the first place . At any rate , Iris takes a nap early in the film and wakes up to find Froy gone , and a freaky lady across from her who looks like the Bride of freaking Frankenstein says that there was never an old woman there , and the search begins . The investigation that Iris conducts in search of her friend provides the body of much of this fascinating film , and Iris's musician friend from the hotel joins her for a good portion of it , becoming the second of the two ordinary people involved in extraordinary events in this film . The two businessmen on the train ( again , you know them from my review of The 39 Steps , I watched these movies too close together ! ) provide much of the comic relief during the film as they are constantly concerned with getting back to London in time for a cricket match , despite even the most deadly conditions aboard the train , and the musician from early in the film provides a rather unwelcome partner in investigating Froy's disappearance . There are several interesting montages in this film . Editing is one of the most powerful tools that Hitchcock put to use in many of his early films , and it is used to great extent here , although not always with clear meaning . I am curious about the extensive montages that are shown of the exterior of the train as it begins moving , as well as between scenes on the moving train . But there are also montages that are very clever and very effective , such as the one in the middle of the movie in which Iris looks at all of the people sharing the cabin on the train with her and realizes that they all bear some physical resemblance to Froy , suggesting that maybe she really did imagine her as so many people have been telling her . That was , after all , a pretty nasty bump on the head . Late in the film there is the necessary addition of the blurring of the lines between the good and the bad guys . The neurologist who travels around performing miraculous brain surgery turns out to be not such a great guy , and the nun wearing suspicious high heels also turns out to be not quite as suspicious as she is initially portrayed . We are left unaware of who can be trusted and who is telling the truth , constantly questioning which side each person is on , even the musician and the two businessmen . In the shootout scene at the end of the film , we get the most tense and most amusing scene in the entire film . There is a lengthy shootout involving a shortage of ammunition and nowhere to run , during which the businessmen , who are themselves participating in the shooting , casually mention things like how they'll never make it on time for the match NOW , and when they are told what is happening , they don't believe it . They express one of the widespread public opinions that allows Hitchcock to be so successful with films about ordinary people in extraordinary situations ? ' Things like that just don't happen . ' There is also , I might mention , a curious duality in the title of the film . I read an interview of Hitchcock somewhere where he was explaining that the title refers to both the disappearance of Froy as well as the subsequent disappearance of the ' lady ' that Iris is at the start of the film and the emergence of the investigator that she becomes . This is a duality that is reflected in many other areas of the film , not the least of which is the fact that , like many other Hitchcock films , The Lady Vanishes contains an unusual but surprisingly effective juxtaposition of comedy and tension , resulting in an entertaining thriller that can make you laugh just as much as it can make you nervous .
544122	562732	4189	10.0	Chaplin introduces himself to the world .	There is some disagreement over whether or not this is really the first film in which Chaplin performed as the beloved Tramp , since apparently Mabel's Strange Predicament was filmed a month earlier ( although released two days later ) , but the interest of the film as the first time that audiences saw his famous character , as well as the fact that he was clearly still learning about it himself , remains clear . This was long before the times of screenplays and film scripts , and it is clear from watching the film that it is completely ad-libbed , but what is also clear is not only the talent but also the symbolism and the foreshadowing of Chaplin's later career , which Chaplin could not even have known he was doing himself . A lot of people have made the mistake of judging this film based on the quality of Chaplin's later work , which is ridiculous not only because the film was made during such an embryonic period of film history , but also because less than a half a year before it was made , Chaplin was acting on stage in England and knew absolutely nothing about film-making . Only a few years before this film was made , a film that depicted a group of people simply walking past the camera or people jumping into a lake was considered successful . The very thought of a " moving picture " had itself not lost its sense of being a novelty , so this film , if anything , was ahead of its time . What is also worth noting is that , in the world's first look at Chaplin's most famous character , we get such a clear sense of his love of the crowd and his desire to be in front of the camera . It is very important when watching these early films to keep in mind the historical context in which they were made , and not only the films made by Chaplin but from anyone else who was making them during this period . This is the very beginning of film-making in Los Angeles , a rare look at one of the cinema's biggest talents literally learning his talent on camera in a young Hollywood . To write the film off because of simple comedy or time-damaged quality is absurd . First of all , I am immediately fascinated by the film because of the fact that it was filmed in Venice , California , where I lived until about two months ago . Nothing is recognizable , since it was filmed 90 years ago and most of the setting is covered by crowds of people , but it should also be noted that Chaplin is literally trying on the costume which would soon make him one of the most famous people in the world , and in this six-minute comedy he is wandering around in a film learning his own act . That people today immediately demand high-budget quality from a film like this is ludicrous , to say the least . It's also interesting to consider the fact that , while the film is very , very simple and the improvised comedy is not complex in any way , it is also very real and fits perfectly as an introduction to Chaplin as an actor and the Tramp as an everyday character . Watch any live , on-location news broadcast today and look at what any jerk standing behind the camera is trying to do , and the realism of some guy at the auto races , the Tramp , wandering in front of the camera and mugging makes even more sense . It's also interesting to see the people in the background , curious about this new film thing , obviously staring directly at the camera and watching the filming . Chaplin , as he did in Making A Living , his first film , plays a bit of an unlikable character , but only unlikable as compared to what the Tramp would later become . He was a cheat and a swindler in Making A Living , while here he is just an annoying passer-by who won't go away . The film is book-ended by odd clippings of a note to " his best girl , " and it is unclear why he " made tracks for the track , " but for whatever reason , he was there and made it his mission to be in front of the camera of an increasingly irritated cameraman as much as possible . The cameraman that Charlie is constantly blocking is played by Henry Lehrman , who directed the first few of Chaplin's comedies and with whom Chaplin never had a very positive relationship , either on screen or off . So many people are immediately put off by the technical crudity or stylistic simplicity or physical decay of films like this , but I think that they are even more fascinating for reasons like this . Filmed more than 90 years ago , it is still a clear look at Chaplin's budding career , both on and off the screen . Only a few months later , he would begin directing his own films and his nearly unmatched career in film-making would be launched . Anyone with even a mild interest in film history or silent films should not miss this one , as it is a major landmark in cinematic history and the career of one of its biggest stars . For those of you that demand complex plots and polished film-making , maybe you should stick to watching modern film .
544247	562732	108550	10.0	A change of pace for almost everyone involved results in spectacular success .	I recently stumbled upon the last half of one of those Top 50 Child Stars TV shows , which had a segment on Leonardo DiCaprio , showing interviews with him when he first started acting and would make jokes about how famous and rich he was , having had no way of knowing how astronomically rich and famous he would go on to be . Anyway , the show described his performance in What's Eating Gilbert Grape as one of his most charming , which turned out to be a tremendous understatement . The film takes place in the motionless town of Endora , Iowa , and concerns the world of Gilbert Grape , whose life is in a constant state of turmoil . He works for a tiny local general store that has come under the competitive strain of a massive supermarket which has opened just outside of town . Needless to say , the store is a major topic of conversation among the local townspeople , because a big store in a town like Endora is big news . I think the real charm of the movie lies in the fact that it is able to portray what you normally might consider to be a highly dysfunctional family and make them charming and , in the context of the town and world they live in , lovable . All of the problems that the family suffers on a daily basis are right at the forefront throughout the film , but no one ever really seems unhappy , except for the mother , and we get the feeling that her unhappiness is both the cause and the result of her morbid obesity . We get a brief explanation of how she came to be so heavy , but not really much more than , " I wasn't always like this . " Gilbert is about 21 and seems to be the only one mature ( and mentally and physically able ) enough to hold the family together , and the majority of the movie focuses on his struggles to do that in normal life . He is in charge of his mentally retarded brother Arnie ( DiCaprio ) , has to periodically subdue his intolerably obnoxious sister , who looks like she belongs in a different family and a different society ( and she believes that , too ) , while at the same time getting to work on time , hanging out at coffee shops with his similarly offbeat friends talking about the undertaking business . In between all of this , a local desperate housewife periodically orders groceries for delivery from the general store where he works , and she tends to be a little less desperate after he leaves . It seems that all of this normality , charming in both its daily routine and its total difference from the daily monotony that the majority of us are used to , is presented to us so that we can get to know Gilbert , his daily life , and his family , as they are before the cataclysmic arrival of Becky ( Juliette Lewis ) . Becky is on a vacation of sorts with her mother and stops in Endora long enough for her and Gilbert to develop a romantic interest in each other , and she thereby breaks the series of monotonies which the first part of the movie introduced us to . Monotonies which may have continued forever had she not arrived . There are a series of events that take place after Becky arrives as Gilbert tries to assimilate her into his well-established life , testing the waters and taking new risks that he would never have even considered before , and learning something about himself from the results , as we all do . The Grapes are a family that would very likely knock you off your feet if you were to run into almost any of them in person , but the movie is so good at treating them as humans that they are not a spectacle at all , even when Arnie is repeatedly climbing the local water tower , much to the chagrin of the local police force , who have been promised repeatedly that this is the last time . It never is , and when we see Arnie up there on the tower , we cheer for him , and the reason we cheer for him is the same reason why the movie is so effective . We don't cheer for him because we identify with his struggle against a couple of grumpy cops , but as though he has made an accomplishment , because in his mind , he has .
544173	562732	213847	10.0	Hell hath no fury like relentless gossip .	Malena is a film that gives the impression that there are no innocent parties . The men are guilty of dirty , lustful thoughts ( and some of more than just thoughts ) , the women are guilty of gossip , violence and probably more than a little envy , and Malena is guilty of being a homewrecker . But in looking back at the movie it seems that what caused the problems were two things ? gossip and something like insecurity . Roger Ebert wrote probably the most idiotic review I've ever seen him come out with about this movie . He missed the point of this movie even more than he missed the point of Memento , and his review of that movie was like a blind man describing a shooting star . He describes Malena as a schoolteacher " of at least average intelligence , who must be aware of her effect on the collective local male libido , but seems blissfully oblivious . " Roger , seriously , are you joking ? BLISSFULLY ? ? Did you sleep through this movie ? She almost never speaks at all and never displays even the slightest hint of a smile . Given the extent of her depression and stifling sadness , it is astounding to me that anyone in their right mind could attach the word " blissfully " to any element of her character . I know what that's like though , because sometimes I completely miss something about a movie and I think that something else is the stupidest thing in the world because of it , at least until someone explains what I missed and then it all makes sense . Watch Malena , for example , walking through the central square in town at any point in the movie . If you think she keeps her eyes on the ground directly in front of her because she is in a state of pure , ignorant bliss , then trust me . You are missing something . I don't know if Malena was actually unaware of the effect that she had on the townspeople , but I find it nearly impossible to believe that she did . That thought actually never even occurred to me until I read Roger Ebert's gem of a review . Her behavior struck me much more like someone who had been dealing with such behavior from the men around for her whole life . I doubt very much that she doesn't understand the concepts of human physical attraction . Moving on . Set against the backdrop of World War II reminded me of Life is Beautiful , especially given the uncertain mix of comedy and tragedy . It wasn't as powerful on both sides here as in Life is Beautiful , but it was truly heartbreaking to see Malena suffering and trying to ignore the increasing tension that was being generated around her . It's hard to say that she was a victim of her own beauty , but it was really what drove all of the conflict in the story . The women at first seemed to be upset with their husbands because of their stares , and things got worse and worse because of the endless gossip which seemed to monopolize the talk of the entire town . If anyone was talking about anything , it had something to do with the latest sexual escapades of Malena . Women would not sell her good food at the town market , so she had to get it from men who expected things in return . There was a scene where an officer was at her home , but I don't think there was any indication that they had sex . It was clear that he was more interested than she was , and later it was her that wound up in court for having an amorous relationship with a married man in uniform . The courtroom performance of Malena's lawyer , by the way , is one of the highlights of the movie . I'm not really sure how to feel about the women involved in the climax of their collective hatred of Malena , because surely Malena did not sleep with the husband of every woman involved , and of those whose husbands committed no crime other than looking at a beautiful woman , what did they then think of their wives , who would do such a thing out of pure jealousy and envy ? I'm a man myself ; so I can't speak from a woman's point of view , but if your husband cheats on you , take it out on him . Don't go and beat up the subject of his affections , especially if it is nothing more than a beautiful woman that he looked at . Imagine all of the attractive women beaten up without knowing why . Weaving his way throughout all of this chaos is Renato , a 12-year-old boy who has conceptualized Malena as the ideal woman in all ways . He sees himself as her protector , desperate to save her from the tension that he sees growing around her , the unfair antagonism that is being leveled at her , for really no fault of her own . His identification of Malena as the subject of his developing sexuality reminded me of another great film , The Hairdresser's Husband . If you liked this , see that one , too . Oh and if you're Roger Ebert , maybe watch this one again . And stay awake this time .
543963	562732	169547	10.0	Another example of an excellent but largely misunderstood movie .	American Beauty is another one of those movies that everyone seems to vote for as the Best Picture of the last ten years or so that did not deserve a Best Picture Oscar ( yeah , you've seen the polls ? ) . This is a perfect example of a widespread misunderstanding of the quality of the film . American Beauty is not a satire of the typical American family , as I've often heard it called . Nor is it a childish comedy on the level with Road Trip or American Pie , as I've also been shocked to hear it compared to . It is a film about America's obsession with superficial beauty and , perhaps even more , the complications and problems that come as a result of trying too hard to conform to the norms of modern society ? associating happiness with financial success and whatnot . Lester Burnham ( Kevin Spacey ) is one of these people who has gotten the supposed cushy office job , he lives in a nice house in a nice neighborhood , has a beautiful and wealthy wife , and appears to be an all-around successful man . When we see closer into his life , however , we see that even though everything looks stable from the outside , his entire life is meaningless and falling apart . His wife does not respect him , she cheats on him , and their sex life is non-existent , his daughter is embarrassed by him , he realizes that he has a pointless job at which he is wasting his life away , and he knows that if he doesn't do something about all of this , he'll die with a healthy bank account and an empty soul . Lester decides to throw away all of the meaningless crap that he has accumulated in his life and have fun . He quits his office job , which he hates , and gets a job at a fast food restaurant , which he surprisingly enjoys , he smokes pot with the neighbor's son , and he fantasizes about his daughter's friend , curiously named Angela . Is any of this wrong ? Clearly , there is some debate about whether or not a 40-year-old man can , in good conscience , fantasize about a high school girl , more than any other of the questionable occurrences in the film . Personally , I think that this moral diversion comes as a result of his poor choices earlier in life which led to his current unhappiness and deviating thoughts . This is just another point that the movie is trying to get across . This is a guy who tried for his whole life to be socially and financially accepted , and look at how miserable and pathetic he is . You can complain all you want about this curious relationship , but keep in mind that at the end of the film , he gets a grip on himself and realizes what he is doing . Clearly , the film revolves around Lester's struggles with himself and his life , but there are several other characters that are not as central but also play significant roles in the film . Lester's neighbor is an ex-marine experiencing anger management problems and difficulty with his sexual orientation , and this man's son Ricky is a strangely observant kid who lives in a difficult household but maintains a clear view of the important thingsin life . Lester's daughter can't stand her family and is struggling with an attraction to Ricky that she initially doesn't understand and doesn't particularly like , and her friend Angela is the blonde cheerleader type who wants nothing more than to be accepted and respected , and she seeks these things through her huge efforts to be sexually attractive . This is a complicated character structure , and it is topped off by the striking character development that takes place in every single character in the movie by the end , and this is really one of the film's strongest points . In American Beauty , we don't see the life of a person as it is changed and affected by the world around him or her , we see the lives of a whole group of people as they interact with each other and change while following the rules set for them by the society that they grew up in . This makes the film much more effective and the message much clearer . ( spoilers ) Clearly , this is something of a worst-case scenario , but nothing in the film is impossible . Everyone ( at least those of us in America , I suppose ) is capable of following the rules of society too closely and ending up miserable like Lester Burnham and his family and friends and neighbors , so watch out . Even Lester's terrible ending is not necessarily tragic . He knew when he quit his job and started working at a fast food restaurant , along with all of his other seemingly reckless behaviors , that he was endangering his future , but he was enjoying himself . He was feeling better than he had in years and years , and that mattered - as it should to all of us , to an extent - more than anything else . The only person left unhappy was the neighbor , who killed Lester because he still doesn't understand himself and is ashamed about something that he has discovered . Each character in the film represents a different lesson that can be learned by everyone . They're not all working together to deliver one big message , they're all giving something of their own , adding to the richness and superiority of the film as a whole . Make no mistake , all you poll voters , American Beauty WAS the Best Picture of 1999 .
544650	562732	140352	10.0	Excellent legal drama ?	In The Insider , Russell Crowe once again proves his versatility as an actor . It's amazing how different he looks in this film from his other roles , particularly Mystery , Alaska and Gladiator . Here , he plays the part of Jeffrey Wigand , a man who is torn between his responsibility to uphold his agreement to keep his mouth shut about happenings with a gigantic tobacco company and his duty to inform the public of potentially harmful products . He was fired from his position as the head of research and development , and as he gingerly begins to speak to Lowell Bergman ( Al Pacino ) , a spokesman from 60 Minutes , he begins receiving death threats aimed at himself and his family . Crowe delivers yet another outstanding performance , as does Al Pacino , who flawlessly creates the type of character that his role calls for . Not only is this a very interesting story , but it also gives a very good look at how big business corporations work , with both the massive cigarette companies as well as the respected television show , 60 Minutes , being presented in a new light . The casting was perfect for this film , everyone delivered excellent performances . The legal thriller is an almost endlessly interesting genre , but The Insider puts a new twist on the almost overdone subject , resulting in an excellent film that should not be missed .
544249	562732	475276	10.0	" Do we have any communication with the President at all ? "	I have yet to see any of the films that have been coming out lately about the attacks , and I had deep reservations about this movie , simply because I had a hard time imagining how they could make a movie about what happened that day and really do justice to the events that took place and the people that were involved . I guess I just couldn't imagine how they could make a movie about and keep politics out of it , but director Paul Greengrass has done just that , and with spectacular success . I think that the only line in the entire movie which might have carried some political message is the one I put in my summary line above , but even this would only be a political statement if it were forced to be . In reality , no they didn't have any communication with the President , but that was because he was sitting in that classroom in Florida . He was making a public appearance and was simply not available for standard contact , I guess you would say . Bush largely escapes criticism in Greengrass's film , which I must say is something of a relief . I think we have seen plenty of films that bash Bush for his response to and behavior during the attacks , regardless of how relevant they are . Greengrass understands that we don't need to see that anymore . The government itself , however , receives the full blow of harsh criticism , spearheaded by such scenes as the air traffic controllers trying to get permission to act against the hijacked planes before they reach major metropolitan areas . They are still struggling to get this permission more than an hour after the second plane has hit the World Trade Center , and if I remember correctly , up until that time they were only given something like two or three jets . Unarmed ones . Most importantly , the film tells the powerful story of the people aboard the flight that took control of the airplane from the hijackers and disrupted what may very well have been the destruction of the White House . Regardless of the lives lost ( the White House had been evacuated long before the plane would have hit ) , to have lost the White House would have done catastrophic psychological damage to the country . In a different way than the loss of life in New York had , but if the White House had been hit , people would barely have noticed the Pentagon . The film succeeds not only as a humanitarian story about the incredible bravery that took place on board United 93 , but also as a telling of the events as they happened . It succeeds as a crackling thriller as good as any of Tom Clancy's " Ryan " films , with the added bonus that everything that takes place is real . It works as a thriller without even needing to resort to fiction or contrived situations . The tension that you feel is so real that it's almost like you're watching the news . As I said , I haven't seen World Trade Center , and I'm a little nervous about it , mostly because Nicholas Cage is starring , but if they can make movies this good about the attacks , leave the politics at the door , and tell the story so powerfully and with so much respect for those lost , then it will settle my reservations about films about . Whether this can be done with the second Iraq war , however , remains a mystery .
544600	562732	124595	10.0	Incredibly intense drama .	Return to Paradise is probably the most intense drama that I've ever seen . Three friends , Danny , Lewis , and Tony , travel to Malaysia for a vacation , taking a trip that will change all of their lives forever . When one of them decides to stay there at the end of the trip to help the wildlife , it starts a chain reaction that brings the other two back to Malaysia hoping to save their friend's life . There is a curious subplot here involving the all too common thought among Americans that we are so high on the international food chain that we can simply leave the country and then all laws do not apply to us . As is made very clear to these three friends , even the most foreign of foreign countries have their own laws , and even the great United States cannot always help you when you break them . The year after Return to Paradise was released , there was another film released called Brokedown Palace that borrowed so heavily from it that it was almost a remake with females . But even though that film made every possible effort to capture the intensity and power of Return to Paradise , it just could not achieve the same effect . This is not only because Brokedown Palace was released after Return to Paradise or even because it is such a rehash of the same idea , but simply because Return to Paradise is one of those movies that has such a powerful effect that any succeeding film that approaches the same idea cannot re-create the same experience . There is an amazing atmosphere that permeates the entire film , from the beginning part with the three friends ' vacation in Malaysia to the scenes in New York . Downtown New York was presented just as well as the Malaysian prison , making each of them that much more effective as far as communicating the horrific experience that Lewis McBride ( yet another brilliant but traditionally unenviable role played by Joaquin Phoenix ) suffers through for two years before Sherriff and Tony learn what has happened and are suddenly faced with a decision that will change their lives forever . ( spoilers ) One of the many things that is truly admirable about Return to Paradise is the ending . Rather than trying vainly and failing spectacularly to force a smile onto unhappy material ( as was the case in Brokedown Palace ) , we see an east Asian country stand up for its laws and enforce them in their own way . This film delivers a powerful message that the United States is not all-powerful . We cannot simply travel to a distant country and think that we can do whatever we want because we're out of America and clearly this country where no one even speaks English can have their own rules much less be able to enforce them . Lewis suffered a horrible fate , which most people in America would think was extremely harsh for the relatively harmless crime they had committed , but Malaysia has their own beliefs about that crime , their own punishment for it , and their own reasons for not relenting simply because this was an American kid . Of course , they're never going to achieve a successful democracy over there in Malaysia if they keep killing off their potheads . Who would be president ? ?
544079	562732	24184	10.0	A true classic . This is a historic action thriller that is not to be missed .	What a great show this was . Claude Rains plays Jack Griffin , a scientist who discovers a formula with which he renders himself invisible . The only side effect of the drug is that it also slowly drives the subject insane . The special effects are terrible , in many cases it's laughably obvious how they were created , but you need to remember that this film is almost 70 years old ! For special effects like those in The Invisible Man to have been created in the early 1930s , when even SOUND was still fairly new , is extremely impressive . Even though the structure of The Invisible Man was fairly simple , there were elements of the story that showed how well thought out the movie was . Griffin points out that dirt on his feet , snow on his shoulders , and even dirt under his fingernails would be enough to give him away . He needs to wait a certain amount of time after he eats because until his food is fully digested , it is still visible ( THAT would have been interesting to see ) . With The Invisible Man , James Whale has delivered yet another masterpiece , and I think that this is among the better ones . The film has definitely dated ; the black and white photography is gritty , the camera movements are often jumpy , and the dialogue has that " old movie " scratchy sound to it , but none of these things should discourage anyone from watching this excellent film . It is one of the establishing films of horror / thriller history , and it should not be missed .
544057	562732	12349	10.0	" A picture with a smile ? and perhaps , a tear . "	Charlie Chaplin's first full length feature film , and his biggest success up to that date , is a remarkably heartwarming story , which makes the surprising connection between slapstick comedy and dramatic tragedy . It begins with a woman who's " sin was motherhood , " who gives birth to a baby she can't support at a Charity Hospital which is kept pad-locked from the inside . She is forced to abandon it in an alley , and before long Chaplin wanders by and what follows is one of the best sequences of the film , as he is casually strolling by and then , through a series of odd but entirely believable situations , he is unable to get rid of it . It is no secret that little Jackie Coogan nearly stole the show from Chaplin ( who was in top form ) playing the little boy at 5 years old . Charlie's life is thrown into turmoil by the unexpected arrival of the baby , but eventually he sort of organizes his life and when the kid gets a little older they make a nice living together , the boy breaking windows and Charlie selling replacements . Soon the police notice so they have to cut and run , because there are other conflicts approaching which will warrant screen time much more than how they make money . It is interesting to watch the film oscillate back and forth from Chaplin's traditional slapstick comedy and a much more developed , dramatic story . The film is interspersed with pure slapstick and some genuinely moving moments ( sometimes simultaneously , if you can believe that ) , but overall it is a truly heartwarming tale of friendship and family and survival , and it is never once predictable , all the way until the last frame . There is a quick scene where the kid gets into a fist fight with another little boy , and in between " rounds , " Charlie is rubbing the kid down and congratulating him on fighting so well , and giving him hints for the rest of the fight . Meanwhile , the other kid's brother shows up , a massive oaf of a man who looks more like Frankenstein's monster than anything else . What follows is a pretty funny fight that looks startlingly similar to the fight between Charlie and the town bully in Easy Street . This is a slapstick set-up that is so simple that it could have been thrown in just to take up screen time , were it not for it's direct relevance to the story . At another point , there is pure slapstick taking place in their little shack of a home , as the 1921 version of Child Protective Services shows up to tear the young boy crying from Jackie's arms . I think this is the only time in any film that I've ever seen genuine , low-brow slapstick so seamlessly combined with a truly sad and heartbreaking incident . This combination , not just here but throughout the film , is The Kid's biggest achievement . There is a dream sequence near the end of the film that I am really not sure what to think about , although my understanding is that volumes have been written about it's symbolic meaning , both within the movie and in reference to Chaplin's personal life . And speaking of which , supposedly there were some legal issues involving money and divorce for which Chaplin sped the film stock to Utah for editing . I don't know which story to believe , that it was because of Chaplin's painful divorce or because he was unhappy with his salary ( I would bet it's a little of both ) , but the film is here and I guess ultimately that's all that matters . In the five or six times that I've seen The Kid , I am always a little uncomfortable with that kiss that Charlie gives the kid when he finally rescues him from the back of that truck , if only because I am conscious that he is not the tramp's real son , either on screen or off . Then again , I am looking at it with 21st century eyes . Some of Shirley Temple's early films are also a little disturbing to me , although for not quite the same reasons . By this time , Chaplin was fully on the road to his career in full length feature films , and after 36 short comedies for Mack Sennett at Keystone Studios and a dozen or so more for Essanay and Vagabond ( along with a few assorted others ) , Charlie was fast on the way to establishing himself as one of the greatest stars in the history of the cinema .
543815	562732	299977	10.0	Better than the hype would have you believe .	There are times when movies are released amidst enormous publicity and excitement and turn out to be average or even below average movies , and there are times when movies are released almost completely unnoticed and turn out to be milestones , and most rarely , there are movies that are released surrounded by great expectations and huge amounts of hype , and turn out to be even better than they were built up to be . Hero is , you might say , a close encounter of that third kind . Jet Li , whose startling martial arts capabilities have wowed audiences since Lethal Weapon 4 ( and for years previous to that , before he achieved international stardom ) has officially passed Jackie Chan , I should think , in American favor , which only a year or two ago may have seemed impossible for anyone to accomplish . Both men have released countless martial arts movies over the last decade or so , but it seems to be Jet Li who has been taking his craft more seriously . Of course , both men are incredibly skilled martial artists , but Jet Li has taken his craft in a completely different direction than Jackie Chan . While Jackie Chan's comedies are not less skillful than Jet Li's , they are certainly less dramatically moving . Jackie Chan's fighting style is much more conducive to comedy than Jet Li's , who fights with such captivating style and skill that he is much better used in hardcore action films where he's a closed off weapon , a genuine force to be reckoned with . Jackie Chan uses his skills to entertain people , and despite such flops as Romeo Must Die , Jet Li seems to want to do more with his craft . Hero , for example , is told through a series of flashbacks , as Jet Li in the present tense spends the vast majority of the movie on his knees before the king . The photography in the film is some of the most impressive I've ever seen in a movie , and embodies all of the things that I love about Japanese film-making . The lengthy shots and slow action during the scenes between Li and the king remind me of some of the best works of Kurosawa , while the stunning artistry of some of the fight scenes , many of which are given a color and display it with incredible prevalence and beauty , are so amazing that even someone who simply cannot accept zero-gravity in kung-fu movies ( I have a bit of a hard time with that myself ) can appreciate them . They take martial arts to a whole new level even beyond that seen in Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon . Posing as a messenger who has brought news to the king of an intricate plot to kill him , which he himself has stopped by dealing with the assassins personally , Li is granted unprecedented access to the throne , which no one has been able to approach closer than something like 100 paces for years . But the king is so impressed with Li's story that he rewards him by granting him permission to approach to within mere feet of the king . Gradually , it becomes apparent that Li , whose character in the movie is nameless , is one of the assassins himself , and has created this story with the help of the other assassins in it in order to win that very access to the throne . The king's realization that he has granted extraordinary royal access to an assassin is impressive indeed . But here is where the movie really gets powerful . Beyond the fight scenes , which are staggeringly remarkable both in their size , the way they are photographed and edited , and the way they are fought , the story thus far is impressive but fairly simple . But the movie has something to say about revolution , because Li has come within paces of the king , and both know that he could easily kill him , but he doesn't . He stands up and walks away , leaving a message immeasurably more powerful than if he had killed the king . Another king would have been brought in , Li would have been ultimately killed by the guards , who would arrive too late to save the king and may suffer some casualties themselves , but in the end he would be killed . The important thing is that another king would be brought in to carry on the legacy of the fallen king , this time maybe with tighter security . But because Li came close enough to kill the king but stood and walked away ( to his death , as it were ) , that king will go on ruling with Li's accomplishment in the back of his mind for the rest of his life . I could kill you right now , but I'm not going to because I've beaten you already . My job is done here . THAT is a message to an infallible dictator that is far more powerful than any measure of violence could ever be .
544208	562732	107822	10.0	Sleepy and brilliant .	There is a scene in The Piano where three women are walking through the woods discussing the bizarre behavior of Ada ( Holly Hunter ) , and her incessant piano playing . Just as I was getting a little irritated that Director Jane Campion would have the sound effect of the woman peeing , a decidedly distasteful sound , the woman peeing says about Ada's piano playing , " To have a sound creep inside you is not at all pleasant . " And I realize that Campion is thoroughly in charge of every sight and sound in the film , from beginning to end . It's a slow , moody drama , to be sure , and this is probably why it took me so long to get around to watching it again . I remember seeing it with my parents when I was a kid , but I found it to be so boring that I asked if I could go into another auditorium and watch a different movie . I know now why they said yes . Holly Hunter inhabits the silent role of Ada , a mute woman who enters into an arranged , loveless marriage in 1850s New Zealand , incidentally the place where Anna Paquin , who gave the most stunning performance in this movie , grew up . Campion's New Zealand feels like a small , isolated island surrounded by a cold , dreary sea , and cinematographer Stuart Dryburgh relishes the opportunities he has for cold , warm , and emotional lighting , literally painting the movie in cold or brilliant colors for us , and the results are fantastic . San Neill and Harvey Keitel play opposing roles , Neill as Alisdair Stewart , Ada's arranged husband who hopes that they will grow to love each other , and Keitel as George Baines , a man with Maori symbols tattooed on his face and who has a relationship with Ada that achieves astonishing change throughout the film . But it is Anna Paquin who steals the show entirely . Her performance is so brilliant and so unexpected that many times I forgot about the rest of the film and just tried to figure out how Jane Campion got that performance out of her . It is one of the best child performances in film history . Incidentally , I had some bizarre Sam Neill coincidences today . First I watched a terrible time travel film this afternoon called A Sound of Thunder , and one of the threads on the IMDb message boards for that movie asked what people's favorite time travel movies were , and many people mentioned The Final Conflict , which stars Sam Neill . Then while I was watching The Piano , out of nowhere I started humming to myself this old Rob Zombie song called Demon Speeding , where the chorus goes like this , " In the mouth of madness , down in the darkness , no more tomorrow , down in the hollow . . . " And I thought , " Hey , In the Mouth of Madness , I haven't even thought about that movie since high school ! " And then I looked it up on the IMDb and sure enough , Sam Neill stars in it . Sorry , I just thought I'd mention that . But more importantly , The Piano is a stunning accomplishment , another complex and engaging film from Jane Campion , who I don't think has made anything much less in her career . Bravo !
543959	562732	285131	10.0	Sure , it's almost 20 years old , but this is still some of the best stand up comedy I've ever seen .	In one of his earlier stand-up videos , Gallagher solidifies himself as one of the funniest and zaniest comedians in the world . His genius use of props as well as his trade-mark of smashing miscellaneous produce in front of the crowd with his Sledge-O-Matic ( ' . . . it is not a slicer , it is not a dicer , it is not a chopper or a hopper . What in the hell could it possibly be ? ! ' ) have set him apart from other comedy acts . This is stand up comedy of the highest quality . He is not just up there making sick jokes , he analyzes the world and makes fun of the stupid stuff , like the locks on the doors at the 7-11 that's open 24 hours a day . He makes fun of commercials , school , the government , people in relationships , banks , pretty much everything that can be frustrating in real life . You've used that bathroom cleaner to clean off mildew that says to only use it in a well-ventilated area right ? Gallagher says , ' If it was well-ventilated there wouldn't be mildew on it ! ' This guy is a genius , not only is he endlessly hilarious , he also has a very active mind that makes things funny in ways that you wouldn't have ever thought of . His comedy is surprising , it's intelligent , it makes you think , and above all , it makes you grab your sides as you fall into almost painful hysterics . Go out and look for his videos , you won't regret it .
544218	562732	1156320	10.0	What WOULD Dieter do ?	After watching this documentary I have discovered that Werner Herzog is among the best directors working today . Unfortunately , I still haven't seen Grizzly Man , which I've heard only glowing things about . When I bought Rescue Dawn , I didn't recognize his name , and I even thought he was one of those famously bad directors , more well-known for their bad taste and incompetence than anything else ( like Uwe Boll or Eli Roth or any of the idiot Wayans brothers ) . Nevertheless , I bought it because I'll watch Christian Bale do anything . I don't think he's ever done anything less than stellar acting . As far as making-of documentaries , this one is longer than many , it gives much more detail about the production and the experiences of the cast and crew , including extensive interviews with Herzog and his brilliant cinematographer . But most of all I loved the descriptions of shooting on location in Thailand and the relationships that certain cast and crew members had with each other on set . Werner Herzog , also , at one point mentions how important it was to him to have as few digital effects in the film as possible . This is one of the only times I've ever heard a director verbally acknowledge that digital effects generally take away more than they add to a film , and it was then that I knew that I need to get some more of his films and pay more attention to him . The stories that Christian Bale and Jeremy Davies and Steve Zahn tell are fascinating and give a clear picture of what it was like making the movie , and all of them delivered astonishing performances . They talk about how Herzog would sometimes film them when they didn't know they were being filmed , and he captured some of the most convincing stuff in the film , because they weren't acting , they were just living in the jungle , and Herzog captured their experience . It's not often that a director as brilliant as that comes along .
544243	562732	251821	10.0	Finally a making of documentary that deserves to be seen with the movie that it's based on !	The thing that I loved about The Making of Jaws was not the fact that the Special Edition DVD featured a shorter version of the documentary than the Special Edition VHS ( both of which I own because I'm just a geek like that ) but the fact that it covers every aspect of production from Peter Benchley's original conception of the story of Jaws all the way to the public reception of the completed film at the test viewings . Even the interviews are edited together smoothly , which is something that these making-of documentaries are notoriously bad at . It also goes into great detail about a wide variety of different topics , bringing back a surprising number of the original cast members . Even the girl who got eaten at the beginning of the film shows up here for an interview . I tend to find it tiring when these supplemental features on DVDs spend a lot of time playing clips of the movie that you just finished watching , so it was nice that this documentary showed so much behind the scenes footage and outtakes , as well as explanations for why certain scenes were not put into the movie . Steven Spielberg gives some great insights into his methods of directing , and everyone has some great stories to tell about the problems that were encountered during production , particularly with the shark hardly ever working . There's a part in this documentary where Spielberg talks about a time when he was genuinely concerned that the studio was going to send someone in to take over the project because he was taking so long during production , which really gives a lot of insight into how difficult film-making can be sometimes . Oh and you get to hear him cuss , too . I'd never seen that before . One of the most popular things that this movie spawned was not only the endless repetition of phrases like " Don't go in the water " and " You're going to need a bigger boat " is a tendency for people to make fun of the movie because the shark looked fake . But when you watch this documentary and see how much work went into making the shark look as real or fake as it did , it really makes you appreciate the movie more . Save your criticisms for the horrendous sequels . One of the other things that I really liked about this documentary was that it showed footage of some of Steven Spielberg's home movies , evidently shot with a home video camera on the sets during production . It was pretty interesting to see footage that he shot that looks like it could have been shot by anyone . Strange to see that one of the greatest filmmakers alive shoots video just like anyone else . A few days ago I watched a supplemental documentary for The Day the Earth Stood Still called Making the Earth Stand Still and I was disappointed not only that it had nothing to do with making the Earth stand still but that it was such a poorly made documentary to accompany one of the best science fiction films ever made , so it was nice to see that the re-release of Jaws was fitted with a fitting documentary .
544598	562732	331560	10.0	Hilarious !	I've read some pretty bad reviews of this little parody , mostly from people who thought it was simply bad taste . But Lord of the Piercing is not the title that you give to something that you expect to be entered into the Short Film Hall of Fame . Sure , it was mostly childish humor , but if there is a place for bad humor , this is it . Before you condemn this little comedy for being tasteless , keep in mind that they make full length feature films out of this same kind of humor and then charge 8 or 9 dollars to see it at the theaters . Lord of the Piercing is a good-natured parody of The Fellowship of the Ring that has it's place as an intro skit at the Academy Awards ceremony and as a little extra tidbit on the DVD . It is nothing more than that and it knows that , and that commands some respect in itself . Besides that , it was hilarious ! Jack Black continues to grow as one of the funniest men working in the movies today ( which is good , considering having performed several unenviable roles , such as that in Cable Guy and , even more , The Jackal ) . No one has seen him in Run Ronnie Run yet , because at the time I'm writing this review , that movie has yet to be released because of it's extremely vulgar content ( much of which involves a song performance by Jack Black ) , but I seriously hope they get moving on that . I saw it at an advance screening almost two years ago and just about fell out of my chair laughing . Jack Black proves himself more and more with every performance that he delivers , and even the wooden and virtually talentless Sarah Michelle Gellar had some good moments in the Lord of the Piercing . They made excellent use of original footage from the film to enhance the quality of their parody , making the story that they installed that much more impressive . Bravo .
544622	562732	325638	10.0	This is absolutely brilliant .	I'll Wait for the Next One sets itself up as a cute little comedy skit , and it delivers on that premise but also surprises you with an incredibly moving finale . Four minute comedies are not supposed to be as moving as this film is , it's funny , charming , and heartbreaking all at the same time , showing you your emotions in a combination that they are not generally found . I can't recommend this movie enough . By the end of the diminutive film you feel like you have known the characters for years , especially the lead man and the woman looking for love , probably because they so perfectly represent . The look on the man's face and the woman's face at the end of the film are brief moments of sheer performing brilliance rarely seen , especially in a short film , which itself is rarely seen . Seek this one out , you will laugh and you will cry , and most of all you will be moved .
544227	562732	28950	10.0	Outstandingly slow !	I should clarify . In what is known as the first prison break film ever made , I was initially surprised at how similar Grand Illusion was to the 1963 film The Great Escape , which is to be expected , of course , since this film probably had such a profound impact on that one ( and any respectable break-out movie that has ever come out , as it were ) . I was also surprised to see that , not only does the movie move at an alarmingly slow pace during much of the middle of it , but several of the characters come across as almost stereotypical caricatures , like they are filling in expected roles in a formula film . But then ( and here is where it really struck me how great this movie is ) , before I even realized anything was changing in my mind , it occurred to me that the combination of the slow pace and the caricatures were almost like a cinematic justification of the pace of the film and the characters that appeared in it . After more and more seemingly slow or even irrelevant scenes , you suddenly see these caricatures not only as characters rather than caricatures , but as people rather than characters . At least as important is Director Jean Renoir's desire to present it not as a movie about relationships between people of different nationalities ( an understandable conclusion , since it takes place in a time of war ) , but of HUMAN relationships , of common bonds of humanity rather than nationality . He explains this in a wonderful video introduction to the film , in which he also talks about the film's nearly miraculous survival after years of having been lost . If you get a chance to catch it on DVD , you will be watching a copy that was thought to have been destroyed by the Nazis decades ago !
544211	562732	401628	10.0	Some interesting thoughts on a brilliant film .	It's really easy to mess up a making-of documentary . I haven't watched one for quite a while but probably the most common mistake that I see in them is when they have a few brief pieces of narration , thoughts on the movie from some of the cast and crew , but the vast majority of it is just clips from the film which , more often than not , you just finished watching . It's like watching a 30 minute theatrical trailer with a voice-over . But the Making of Dances with Wolves tells some good detail not only about what it was like making it but the whole back story about how the movie was basically born , which is a pretty impressive story , by the way . Kevin Costner also says near the beginning that movies are about dilemma , about not knowing what you would do in a given situation , which is exactly what I had been thinking about throughout the movie when I was watching it . The documentary ends with him wondering how he accomplished what he accomplished with Dances with Wolves , and wondering if he could ever do anything like that again , or even if he could have done a few more days of what he had been doing at the time he was making the film . Needless to say , he achieved his goals in making the movie , and so much more . Bravo .
