543794	562732	306047	1.0	An absolute disaster just like the first two .	Now , my bitter disappointment by this time in the ridiculous Scary Movie saga is no surprise , and I have no one to blame but myself for going to the theaters to see it in the first place , and the only weak excuse I have is that I heard from someone that it was much better than the first two ( really , could it possibly have been WORSE ? ? ) because it had a different director . So I figured that since it wasn't TOTALLY a production of the abysmal senses of humor of the Wayans brothers , I would give it a shot , and the only good thing that came of it was that I learned once and for all how important it is to consider a film's target audience before paying real money to sit in an entire theater full of them . So , that being said , if you're the kind of person that would really get a kick out of seeing an eight-year-old boy beaten repeatedly about the head , face , and body with a baseball bat , please , go see this movie . If it would really please you to see that same boy get hit by a car TWICE , you're sure to enjoy this idiotic mess of a film . If , on the other hand , you like to have the slightest speck of actual thought put into a film , you might want to avoid this one , or at least wait until it comes out of video so you don't have to surround yourself with the kinds of people who answered yes to the first two questions . Believe me , I surrounded myself with them a couple nights ago and wished the entire time that I had a pot to put over my head and a wooden spoon to hit it with . That would have been more enjoyable than the movie . When I write my IMDb reviews , I usually try to keep from getting too upset by how bad a movie is . After all , I'm the one that went to see it in the first place , right ? And I don't believe in that ' I want my money back ' crap . Nowhere at any movie theater in the world does it say at the ticket booth ' Satisfaction Guaranteed . ' When you buy a movie ticket , you spent the money whether you liked the movie or not , that's not a hard concept to figure out . I have no problem with a movie being offensive . Quite the contrary , offensive movies tend to be the ones that are most remembered because they made an impression , even if it might have been a relatively bad one . Movies that make you a little bit uncomfortable are the ones that you notice , the ones that make a lasting difference . And I'm not only talking about massively important examples like Schindler's List or American History X or anything like that . Consider this , if every single movie was happy and fun like something like Indianan Jones or Toy Story or Back to the Future , movies would be pointless , they would be little more than pretty things to look at and something to make us laugh and to entertain us for an hour and a half . But when a movie makes us uncomfortable or is offensive to our beliefs or our way of life , maybe just because it shows us something that we don't normally or have never seen and probably don't WANT to see ( like death ) , that's when they gain a new kind of power over us - the power to affect our view of the world . Unfortunately , obtaining this kind of constructive discomfort is not only difficult to capture , it is also VERY easy to screw up , especially when you , as the director / writer / etc , of the film clearly do not care about getting it right and / or do not understand the importance of getting it right . And this is not just true of dramatic war films or deadly serious films , it's also very true of the comedy and even the spoof comedy . The spoof comedy even more than the rest is expected to make fun of the movies that it spoofs and to do it RESPECTFULLY . Granted , some of the jokes in Scary Movie 3 are funny , some of the spoofs are done in relatively good taste ( although , compared to the rest of the material , that's not saying much ) , and some of them I laughed out loud at . But where the Scary Movies go seriously and unforgivably wrong is that they do not understand when they have gone too far , when they've crossed the line , when they've crossed from being childishly amusing to being seriously offensive . And not the good kind of offensive either . I'm not just talking about jokes that are too gross or boobs that are almost popping out or too much profanity , I'm talking about the fact that there WILL be people seeing this movie who have had a brother or a cousin or a SON who has been killed by getting hit by a careless driver , and these people will have walked into this movie having no idea that they are going to see this happen onscreen and have to suffer through an entire theater-full of morons laughing their idiot heads off . Scary Movie 2 featured a character with a disfigured arm , and everyone groaned and yelled and said ' Oh God gross ! ! ! ' when he ate mashed potatoes off his hand as though he were performing fellatio on it . Clearly , Mawn and Sharlon Wayans , or whatever their names are , have no idea that there are people like this in real life , who want to be able to go to the movies and have a good time just like everyone else . So like I said , I have no problem with movies being offensive . I encourage it . But it becomes a problem when the makers of the film have no idea about how the mechanics of offensive material work , and the Wayans brothers are clearly clueless . This is not something that's ' all in good fun , ' this is the absolute bottom of the scale of bad taste , stuff for which there is no place in mainstream entertainment . I hope that I've avoided offending anyone who enjoyed the movie by things I've said in this review . I support constructively offensive material in movie reviews just like I do in the movies , as I described above , and I do not try to offend anyone with what I say in my reviews . So that being said , honk if you love the Scary Movies . Then drive into a tree .
544504	562732	1073498	1.0	I have not seen this movie .	If you look through my reviews , you'll notice that I've reviewed three Scary Movies , along with Epic Movie ( with which this movie deservedly shares a spot on the IMDb Bottom 100 ) not long ago , and in most of them I berate myself for being stupid enough to waste my time watching them . This is the first time I've ever written a review of a movie I haven't seen , and I do it only because I've thrown away so many hours watching the ridiculous tripe that these idiots continue to defecate into theaters . In this case , thankfully , the trailer alone was enough to show me that it was going to be more of the idiotic , nonsensical garbage we have come to expect from Friedberg and Seltzer . I'm willing to bet that their parents tell people that they haven't heard from their kids in years and don't know what they are up to because they don't know how to get a hold of them . Aren't they making those movies , though ? No , no , no , no , no , that's not my son . Definitely not . My son is , ah , anyone else . Have you seen those yellow warning signs that say " Caution : This is Sparta " ? THAT is funny . You don't even have to watch it to know that this movie is not . There are a lot of times when you can ignore the nay-sayers and watch a badly reviewed movie anyway and make up your own mind . This is not one of those times . No stars .
544799	562732	988849	2.0	# 1 Movie To Avoid This Week ( . . . and every week ) . . .	Holy crap . It's not often that a movie comes along that is so morally vacuous that it approaches a level of violent stupidity so intricately bad that it is absolutely not enjoyable on any level . But when it does happen , and it has happened with this movie , it makes my job seem incredibly difficult because I have to sit here and try to write a professional film review when I know without a shadow of a doubt that three simple words would suffice - DON'T WATCH IT . But if you would like to know why , please continue reading . First of all , let's brainstorm about what makes a violent thriller entertaining , shall we ? You need to have an engaging story , something that moves at a brisk pace and maintains interest without relying on the violence to push it along . You need to have not only believable characters but characters that we care enough about to invest our emotions in their well - being , and you need to have a catalyst operating beneath the surface that drives the characters on screen to commit whatever violent acts take place in the movie . Donkey Punch has none of these . Not even a little bit . There is , of course , a lot to be said about violence in the movies . Some say there's too much , some say movies are movies and no movie violence is going to change who people are or entice people to commit violent acts , and some people are just violent movie-hounds and can never get enough . Whatever your personal opinion , I tend to think that we can all agree that at the very least , movie violence should have a point , right ? Not this movie . Donkey Punch gives us a film populated with morons , perverts , rapists and idiot college girls , not a single character worth a scrap of thought or interest , and then asks us to care when they start killing each other off . A group of college-girls meet a group of college-age guys at a European resort and , hungry for some adventure stories to take home from their European vacation , immediately accept a shady offer to come touring the Mediterranean Sea on a luxurious yacht to which one of them happens to have access . Anyone with two brain cells working at the same time would have hesitated for at least a few seconds before accepting such an offer from a bunch of crusty guys like these , but no matter . If nothing else , the immediacy of the acceptance will pretty quickly and thoroughly paint the picture of what the rest of the movie is going to be like . Everyone wants to have sex with everyone else , and while taking turns with the blonde not far into the movie in a drug-crazed orgy , when one guy convinces another guy to try out a little sex move called the " donkey punch . " I won't waste your time explaining what it is . It doesn't matter , it's just a plot device needed to supply the cast with a dead body so that they can spend the rest of the movie killing each other off as they struggle to figure out who can be trusted and who should just be killed . There is not a scrap of realism in the movie , not an iota of clever dialogue or impressive acting , and the by-the-numbers ending does nothing to boost the mood of genuine depression that permeates the entire movie . This thing is a waste in pretty much every way imaginable . Avoid it .
544906	562732	1198138	2.0	f .	Remember that movie Wild Wild West ? Will Smith has said that that movie is one of his biggest regrets , because it opened at # 1 even though it sucked , and he said he hated knowing that so many people were spending their money to watch a movie that wasn't good . At the time I'm writing this , Obsessed is the # 1 movie in the American box office , and I'm wondering if , for example , Beyonce feels as guilty as Will Smith did , because Wild Wild West is about ten times better than this snoozefest . Personally I doubt she has the acting chops to even realize how god-awful this thing is . I've seen some backwards thrillers in my time but THIS ? I care hardly think of where to start . My first question is for Beyonce . I'm wondering if , when she signed on to play the wife of a man stalked by a psychotic blonde , if she knew that her character would ultimately turn out to be just as psychotic as the psychotic one . I'm guessing yes , because here's a direct quote from her character late in the movie ? " You think you're crazy ? I'll show you crazy ! " Wow . If you want to watch Ali Larter squeezing her limited talents into the form of a badly written blonde with some relationship issues and Beyonce talking all tough to her ( and to her husband ) , you might enjoy this movie . Every once in a while a movie comes along that is so flawlessly terrible that the perfection of the way the badness fits together becomes a fascinating area of study . This is one of those times . Sharon is married to Derek who has a new employee at his work , a crazy hot blonde named Lisa who was recently hired on from a temp agency . She falls in love with Derek and forms a fantasy in her head that she and Derek are together , blah blah blah blah . The movie is called Obsessed and stars two women and one man . You don't really need to know anything else in order to know everything there is to know about the movie , except how bad it is . Sadly , you have to watch it to find that out . One of my favorite things was that the movie is as suspenseless as any movie I've ever seen , and yet the suspense music kicks up constantly and I guess we're supposed to scoot forward to the edge of our seats and get all worried and whatnot . There's a scene when Lisa e-mails a picture of herself to Derek which opens itself in a dozen windows as soon as he opens the e-mail , and the orchestra kicks in frantically as Derek slowly clicks them each closed , his wife only seconds away . Did anyone else laugh at this ? First of all , why would you slowly click them closed one by one ? Does he know nothing about computers ? ALT-F4 , man ! ! Or if it's a Mac , Command-W ! ! But of course , if he knew how to close windows like that then we would have missed out on the sheer tension of watching this guy about to suffer the wrath of Beyonce . They actually tried to generate TENSION by having a guy struggling to close windows on his computer before his wife sees it ! ! HAHAHAHAHAHAAA ! ! ! Then again , with a wife as horrific as Beyonce's character , maybe it's a good idea to fear her hysterical wrath . She does , after all , kick him out of HIS OWN HOUSE for three months because she thinks . Not KNOWS , mind you . She SUSPECTS that he had an affair . And when I say his own house , I mean the beautiful , multi-million dollar mansion that they live in , with the sleek new Escalade parked out front . This woman , ladies and gentlemen , is a COLLEGE STUDENT . I have trouble relating to a man who would suffer so much ridiculous punishment at the hands of an insecure and violently suspicious woman , and still beg on his hands an knees for her to take him back . In order for a movie like this to work , you have to care about the characters , that's obvious , but it's impossible here . Obsessed has nothing going for it . It's a movie about one poor guy with two psychotic women around him and I'm going to go ahead and suggest that it's just not possible to make a good movie when your basic premise is so overflowing with the yawn-inducing clichés of cheap , no-rent thrillers . It is informative that Obsessed comes from David Loughery , the same screenwriter who gave us the highly disappointing thriller Lakeview Terrace last year . Obsessed is pretty much exactly the same story , except Lakeview Terrace was about a black neighbor angry at his interracial neighbors . Now we have a black wife going crazy at her black husband's white stalker . Set your watch to beep every ten minutes or so to make sure you can stay awake . It was a struggle for me ! Even worse , I'm not sure who the target is . Angry black women who hate skinny , smart-ass blondes ? Maybe . Word has it that the original title was " Oh No She Didn't , " which would at least have been amusing and advertised right away that the whole movie is a joke . If they had made this a parody , I really think it could have been good , but it takes itself super - seriously , even when challenging us not to laugh at Beyonce flinging Ali Larter all over her house , or not to cringe when she viciously berates her boyfriend , for whom she has not the wispiest scrap of trust but who has committed no crime . The most effective thing that the movie does is convince me beyond a shadow of a doubt that if I ever find myself dating Beyonce I will throw myself in front of the nearest train .
543759	562732	110857	2.0	The first time in my life I've ever consciously missed Bobcat Goldthwaite ?	Ah , so here we are . Rock bottom . The Police Academy series has been through a lot of ups and downs over the years . They seem to have been hugely popular during their times of release , and really , if you look at the numbers , it's not hard to see why such a prodigious stream of sequels was made . The first movie was made for a budget of around $4 . 5 million and brought in a stupendous $81 million at the box office . The second movie brought in $55 million , part 3 brought $43 . 5 million , part 4 $28 million , part 5 almost $20 million , part 6 a meager $5 million , and Mission to Moscow proudly raked in a whopping $126 , 000 . If nothing else , the Police Academy franchise stands as a perfect example of a film series that was played out until it was officially a very , very dead horse . The awesomely moronic plot this time involves a Russian mafia boss named Konstantine Konali ( played by none other than Ron Perlman , now better known as Hellboy ) , who is marketing a video game that he plans to use to secretly distribute a computer virus that will allow him to hack into government security systems and like , take over the world or something . The movie opens with a scene that is meant to show us how purely addicting this game is . We see a news report where a woman is giving her news report , and her co-anchor , a man in maybe his 50s or so , is sitting next to her oblivious what's going on because he's so entranced by the Game Boy he's playing . I imagine we weren't supposed to notice that there was no cartridge in the machine he's playing , but no matter . I'm willing to let that go in order to enjoy the avalanche of stupidity that was to follow . So why are the members of our beloved Police Academy in Moscow in the first place ? Well , it seems that the Russians need help in dealing with the Russian mafia , so they have recruited the help of the most famous police academy in America . And mostly the gang is all here except for Mahoney and Zed , both of whom I am sad to say are missed . Lassard , of course , is his usual self , so he has gotten himself lost and ends up at a Russian funeral within a few hours of touching down in Moscow , so the rest of the team occupies themselves with trying to compile evidence against Konali while Harris follows along two steps behind waiting to jump in at just the right moment and claim credit for everything . As usual this provides plenty of opportunities for bonehead comedy , but they just pulled out all the stops with the low brow humor this time . Harris and Tackleberry end up dancing in full make-up and costume in a Russian ballet in one of the movie's most embarrassing scenes , Harris attempts to spy on Konali and instead gets a dog peeing in his eye through a periscope , and Jones has developed the ability to open safes with his noise effects . Sigh . In the movie's defense , it does have it's moments . Well , it has it's moment , anyway . There is a scene where Tackleberry jumps at the opportunity to give a speech to the Russian authorities about American law enforcement tactics , and he launches into a vicious beratement of the piddly " excessive force " policies that are tying his hands back in the states . Yeah , the movie is spectacularly stupid , but this might have been one of Tackleberry's two or three best scorns in the entire series . If you ever find yourself watching this thing on DVD , make sure to watch the short supplemental video that's included ! I have to admit that I have found it particularly interesting and amusing to watch these videos for each installment in the series , where much of the original cast come back together and discuss the movies . I especially love G . W . Bailey ( who played Captain Harris ) , who clearly has grown weary of having ever had anything to do with the series . In the video for part 5 , he sarcastically mentioned people who would approach him years later and ask if he still had " Dork " tanned across his chest . For this one , it is noticeably difficult for him to conceal his resentment as he talks about his past in performing Shakespeare on stage , and now he's remembered for a dog peeing in his eye . Don't worry , Mr . Bailey , haven't you seen the box office for this movie ? No one's seen it !
544737	562732	217630	2.0	When is this over ? !	How long was this movie ? 10 hours ? 12 hours ? That's what it felt like . What a terrible waste of time this was . First of all , this was an obvious and awful attempt to rekindle some of the inexplicable American Pie hype with Jason Biggs and Mena Suvari . Suvari knows how to act , as she proved in American Beauty , she just didn't do it here . Jason Biggs is the biggest mystery in the film industry right now . How did this idiot get on screen ? As far as the story , nobody gets treated like that in college . I don't care how small the town is that you're from . There are not as many college students with the mentality of a 9 year old that would be necessary to pull all of the stunts that were pulled in this movie . They were real creative with Biggs ' character , too . Dress him up like a geek and put a few obscure words into his vocabulary . And yes , they did manage to squeeze in a falling-down-the-stairs scene for him , what fun . Besides that , what about the housing ? Biggs gets kicked out of the dorms by his dumbass roommates and then what , he talks his way into turning one room in a veterinary hospital into his personal lodgings ? Are you kidding me ? ! Biggs and Suvari have no chemistry on screen , and she can't play the part of a reject like she tried to in Loser , it doesn't fit with her iconography . Terrible acting , a terrible story , and a director who did little more than point and shoot , all adds up to a ridiculous film whose stupidity borders on being offensive .
544019	562732	200550	2.0	Unfortunately , the Internet Movie Database only allows 1 , 000 words , which is not nearly enough to sufficiently communicate how horrible this movie is .	The drawback of watching the huge amount of movies that I watch is that you find yourself watching the same previews over and over again . I saw the preview for Coyote Ugly so many times that I was sick and tired of the movie before it was even released . I was unable to decipher any kind of plot from the preview , and the reason is simple . If the producers had allowed the preview to reveal the extensively recycled and re-done and re-made and used up plot , no one would have bothered to watch the movie . From a business point of view , that's very understandable , and I respect the decision not to reveal how shallow this movie is too early on . However , after seeing the entire film , I have realized that Coyote Ugly is packed full of every cliche ever created by every unoriginal and boring film ever made in cinematic history . ( spoilers ) Young kid decides to leave home to pursue wild dreams in the big city . Encounters difficulties , gets robbed , decides to go home , father encourages her to keep trying , success is inevitably and laughably attained . I accurately predicted at least 80 % of everything that happened in this film . Did anyone not know that there would be a robbery at her new apartment in New York ? Was anyone surprised that she would have some sort of superficial problem getting her music heard ? Is it that hard to predict she would succeed at the end ? Okay , I'll admit that if she failed , the movie probably would never have been made ( what a relief that would have been ) . You can't put a Fight Club ending or an Arlington Road ending on a movie like this . But look at the way the entire movie panned out . Violet was completely isolated from reality during the entire film . Think about the logic here . Violet goes to New York to become a star , but obviously has trouble getting a record executive to listen to her music . She goes home one day to find her apartment robbed . This is the pathetic attempt to make it seem like the real world , but even if it did do that , this is where it stopped . For the rest of the film , everything worked out perfectly . The first guy she meets becomes her wonderful new boyfriend . The first group of girls she overhears in a diner are talking about the lucrative jobs they have , and how one is leaving and there will soon be a difficult effort to replace her . This very same bar happens to be the hottest bar in town , and when Violet inquires about the opening , she is hired within minutes . You gotta be kidding me . Besides all that , everything that happened in the plot is just recycled garbage that has been seen dozens of times before . Violet finds a cute new boyfriend . They get in the usual fight somewhere in the middle of the film , and when she tries to call thinking she wants to apologize or something , she hangs up a split second before he grabs up his receiver , anxiously saying " Hello ? Hello ? " to the usual dialtone . She goes to his house to make things right , and just as she shows up , he's got some girl walking into his apartment ( THAT was the most predictable element of all ) . But wait ! He's not sleeping with her , he's showing her the apartment to see if she might want to move in ! He's a sweetheart after all ! How about Violet's job ? Obviously some problem has to come up ( the suddenly lonely parent , as always , winding up in the hospital ) , and she has to get fired at least once . When she does , she decides to get a job at a quiet little restaurant ( which , for some reason , doesn't seem to have electricity ) , but eventually goes back to her old job . The bar scenes were both laughable and ridiculously exaggerated . No bar in the world looks like that , and even if one did , there would not be scantily clad female bartenders dancing on the bar every few minutes , and even if there were , there would be about 50 bouncers , not just one . You would think a policy or two would change when the airheaded blonde Cammie was pulled into the crowd and fondled by a bunch of drunks . I guess nothing came of that because she didn't seem upset about it at all . Every bar scene in this film was the result not of skillful filmmaking , but of audience manipulation . What a pathetic waste of time . Everything in this movie has been done before , and it has never been done worse than it was done here . Even though New York City is portrayed terribly , at least they thought to throw in an acute bit of stage fright for Violet so she would have a problem that coincides slightly with reality , even though this was also ridiculously unoriginal ( ever see Runaway Bride ? EXACTLY the same thing ) . Coyote Ugly is an awful movie . It follows a formula that is more easily decipherable than the script , and it is the kind of film that will probably be hugely entertaining to you if you have never seen a movie . If you don't like being jerked around at the movie theater , avoid this garbage .
543756	562732	1220557	2.0	There is something genuinely sad going on here . . . .	I am a big believer that quite often the supplemental documentaries included with DVDs can show you some things about the movie that you didn't realize , and even turn around your entire experience about the movie . In the best cases , these little featurettes can make even bad movies a little better , but such is not to be the case with Handmade Music , which is about the efforts involved in making the music for Dan in Real Life . Unfortunately I don't have anything nice to say about the movie , which was a depressing failure , and this little documentary is little more than a lot of people congratulating each other on a job well done on a project that just flopped spectacularly . I can appreciate the effort that everyone put into making the music just right and how strongly they believed in the movie , but there is something truly sad about watching so many artistically professional people talk about their undying devotion to what turned out to be such a bad movie .
544179	562732	67810	2.0	Maybe I'm too old , maybe I'm not old enough . Maybe I just can't dig it , baby . I can't get down with the funk .	Whatever the case , Sweet Sweetback's Baad Assssssss Song came off to me as a vibrant exercise in bad taste , bad acting , a barely discernible plot , VERY bad editing , and lots of stupid , stupid white people . The opening feeding scene , the one with the whole crowd of women inexplicably overflowing with lust from watching a dirty kid shovel food into his mouth , is reminiscent of The Hairdresser's Husband , the vastly superior French film that uses similar low-cut necklines revealing massive breasts to illustrate the formation of sexual taboos later in life . Sweet Sweetback's Baad Asssss song has no time for that . Nope . Next scene , that same dirty kid is naked and reluctantly ravishing someone that I assume is a prostitute , but who could just as easily be his babysitter , his teacher , his mother , or his sister . Doesn't matter which one , really . Even if it was his mother it wouldn't be as tasteless as the fact that what we're looking at is a 13-year-old kid completely naked between the legs of some woman who is equally naked . I have no problem with sex scenes , of course . It just strikes me as weird to see a movie that literally shows a 13-year-old kid having sex and then the movie ( Shocked ! Shocked ! ! ) gives itself a tagline like ' Rated X by an all white jury . ' What the hell ? I'm reminded of a classic Saturday Night Live skit in which Jim Carrey , Will Ferrell and Chris Kattan go to a nightclub and viciously gang-hump every woman on the dance floor and then when the security guards drag them to the exit they're all screaming ' What ? ? ! What ? ! ? ! What ? ? ! ? ? ! ' How do they imply that an all black jury might have rated a movie with a naked 13-year-old kid in it ? PG-13 ? That being said , the movie is basically about a lot of incompetent white cops constantly pursuing someone named Sweetback , who has enough connections on the streets to afford him a good deal of protection and , of course , who is generally too cool for spoken dialogue . We're brought into the dismal world of the inner cities , a plight for which the white man is endlessly blamed and , to whatever extent , this may be true , but for the most part this movie celebrates the condemnation of the white man for causing the black man to live such a terrible life , while at the same time celebrating the black man's inability or unwillingness to do anything about that life beyond blaming the white man for it . It's a controversial theory that the black community is more interested in blaming white people for their lot in life than they are in doing something to better their situation , but this movie does absolutely nothing to refute it , which is also the case in a disturbing number of ' blaxploitation ' movies . Blaxploitation itself , as a term , is wildly misleading . I suppose it means that black people are blaxploited by greedy white men , hence their dismal urban lifestyle , while white people are whitesploited by black people , hence their constant appearance as greedy , racist , and complete drooling morons in ' blaxploitation ' films . Pam Grier must be rolling in her grave . I've heard the editing described as quick to disorient the viewer , which is not the case at all . What you have here is obtrusive editing without reason , cuts simply for the sake of cutting . Like many 1970s blaxploitation films , the movie halts in its tracks half a dozen times or so to turn into a music video for a little while , but the rough and awkward editing does not disorient the viewer , it stops the movie completely because it is totally devoid of meaning . It takes your attention away from what is happening on screen and puts it into the weird colors and shapes dancing across the screen , which have nothing to do with whatever the meaning of the movie is . This is not how you infuse a deep meaning or directorial significance onto a cheesy sexy movie , this is how you make a feature length film when you don't have enough story or material to fill that much screen time . Sometimes lines of dialogue are literally played over more than once . The need for such things escapes me . In the movie's defense , it is very good at capturing the urban atmosphere in which the story takes place . When you watch the movie , you are there on the streets with the characters , you just have a hard time trying to follow what they're doing , what they're talking about , who's chasing who and why a black man is dancing on a stool while some idiot white guy stands directly behind him , staring at his backside and laughing hysterically . Wow . The street life is portrayed very effectively , you see how bad it is to live in these areas , but then you have to wonder about the suffering when you see scenes like the one where Sweetback is forced by a gang of hysterical bikers to endure the unending torture of making love to a white woman while they all sit around laughing . What the hell is going on here ? ( spoilers ) Maybe I just made the mistake of watching Dirty Pretty Things just before seeing this , so I came into this movie having just watched a movie that squeezes in the sex and violence because they are necessary elements of the massive plot , while this movie stretches out the sex scenes and throws in random bits of plot here and there just to fill out the rest of the screen time . There literally is a point in the movie where Sweetback is running from the cops through the desert , becomes so decimated that he kills and eats a lizard , and then when he reaches civilization he stops to have sex with a prostitute in the dirt and have a couple of white cops stop by to giggle at him . And not only that , if you make it through the movie you are not rewarded with the delivery of some message or cinematic meaning , you are literally rewarded with a series of shots showing a couple of dead dogs floating in a river . This normally is a figure of speech , but this is some of the stupidest st I've ever seen . Here's something to consider ? at one point in the movie the white cops chase and capture Sweetback , but wait ! He turns out to be just some guy , not Sweetback at all ! The guy gleefully explains that he was paid $5 by some guy to run from whoever chased him , and it just happened to be the police but hey ! It's five DOLLARS ! So the cops don't do a thing at all to this guy , even though he willfully evaded the police . I guess if you're paid to run then it's okay ? The thing that really gets me is that white people are portrayed as so stupid and incompetent and endlessly idiotic in these movies , and yet at the same time they are the people who's power and influence black people simply cannot escape . Given that , here's my question for you - Who do blaxploitation films really make look foolish in the end ? Oh , and yes I realize that Pam Grier is alive and well . Thanks for reading all the way to the end of my review . . .
544561	562732	89173	2.0	The worst one yet .	Contains Spoilers ! The movie starts out with a nightmare that Tommy Jarvis is having . You remember Tommy , played by Corey Feldman in Part 4 , evidently he's grown up to a fabulous future as a mental patient . Thankfully , this was a dream , since it features two nutcases whooping and hollering as they dig Jason out of his grave , where he is buried under about 3-4 inches of soft dirt , and apparently buried wearing his hockey mask and with a stabbing weapon in each hand . Brilliant . Tommy awakens on the way to the mental hospital , around which most of the rest of the movies revolves . In the movie's defense , at least it wasn't yet another slopfest about a lot of teenagers going up to the lake to be rebellious and end up getting killed just like we already knew they would . They are running out of inventive ways to cut up young people for that to drive yet another Friday the 13th installment . Unfortunately , they seem to have decided that since they added a few new gimmicks to the movies , like a mental hospital , a Jason impersonator , and some shockingly dirty rednecks , they didn't need to come up with any new death scenes . Not exactly the most intellectual necessity , but creative deaths are about 85 % of what has always driven this series , and in this one we get more of the same boring killings - a machete pushed through the stomach ( on two separate occasions in this movie , I think ) , slashes across the chest / face , etc . In one scene , Jason plunges a pair on hedge-clippers through some poor girls eyes , but then they screwed it up because we get a shot upwards of his hands holding the clippers and roughly pushing them together , indicating that he had beheaded her . Then we see her and she was just stabbed through the eyes . Why include that shot if it's completely wrong as far as what he did to her ? At any rate , the nutty people who inform the cast that they're all doomed are rather interesting as the above-mentioned dirty rednecks , except they run up to the cast when they're at the mental hospital surrounded by police ( to find out why you have to watch the movie yourself ) , and they run up screaming threats , upset that there is a mental hospital filled with punk teenagers so close to their home . Pretty funny scene , except the woman threatens to kill the next person who comes near their house , then she expands her threat to include the police officers , then she informs the lot of them that she is currently strapped with dynamite and would blow them all to hell if they don't watch their step . Just so you know , if you threaten to even punch someone and there is a police officer within earshot , consider yourself arrested . A verbal threat is assault , and can land you in jail . This woman threatened to kill the kids , the police officer , and then to blow herself up , killing everyone in sight , and the cops just smile as she jumps on the motorcycle with her nutcase son and rides off with him , taking with her the dynamite and any respect I might have had for these cops . Later on , we see these rednecks at home as she is chopping up a chicken , screeching all the while , to feed to her idiot son , and they are approached by a man who knocks on the door , asking if they have any work he can do for some food ( he hasn't eaten in two days ) , so she puts him to work cleaning out the chicken coop and then he can come back and get his stomach filled . Why was this guy in the movie at all ? He literally serves absolutely no purpose other than to inform the audience that these people have a chicken coop that needs cleaning and so that he can be another person for Jason to kill . If they didn't think they had a large enough cast of teenagers for Jason to plow through , I would have suggested just adding a few more characters rather than adding in some wandering oddball in a wife-beater looking for a meal . Instead we have this guy with no part in the movie except that of a hungry victim . ( spoilers ) One of the two most ridiculous scenes in the film concerns her son , who gets beat up down at the mental hospital by Tommy , so he rides home on his motorcycle , screaming that those damn kids made him mad . Rather than going inside to express his anger to his mother , this ridiculous moron rides around the yard on his bike , spinning doughnuts and doing wheelies and screaming at the top of his lungs all the while , flying recklessly around the yard until he either slams into a tree , killing himself , or gets beheaded by a butcher knife that pops out of the bushes . We get the latter , but either would have been satisfying enough , as long as it shut that idiot up . The second of the two most ridiculous scenes in the film is the one where Demon , the older brother of one of the younger but more prominent characters in the movie , takes turns singing ' Hey baby baby ' over and over to his girlfriend on the other side of the craphouse wall . VERY romantic . On the other hand , what the hell else would you expect from someone with a name like Demon ? I guess this was the only thing they could come up with I order to make Demon get concerned when his girlfriend stopped singing back to him . His death , however , was among the more interesting of all of the ones in the movie . Thus brings up a rather important plot point about this movie , that the killer in the hockey mask is not even Jason , but Jason being impersonated by someone , whose identity and motives are revealed at the end of the film after his pretty impressive death scene . Fans might be disappointed that it's not even Jason in this movie , since he was killed in Part 4 , but that doesn't really matter for the most part , because even though it's really just some guy doing all the killing , he is still just as relentless , stolid , and basically impervious to damage as the original . He makes no sounds , doesn't run , and of course can't be killed until enough people have been killed to fulfill an hour and a half running time . This should have opened up a lot of possibilities for the movie , since the last time there was any element of mystery was in Part 1 when the real killer was not Jason Voorhees but his mother , seeking revenge against the kids who brought about the death of her son . But nope , the only mystery is that the killer is not really Jason , who the films makers decided to leave dead for this installment ( viewers at the time of its release were probably expected to expect some sort of ' Evil Never Dies ' resurrection very soon to follow ) , but the ham-handed hints leave all but the most dense viewers very aware of the killer's real identity long before his mask ever comes off . This is surely one of the most hated of the Friday installments among the series ' fans , most likely because the real Jason does not appear , but only in name , almost . For the entire film except for the scenes that hint at the killer's identity and the scene where his mask comes off at the end , he is the real Jason . He acts and moves exactly like him , so the basic attraction of the movie is there , I suppose , but it reminds me of the popular failure of Halloween III , the one which completely departed from the premise of the first two films , having absolutely nothing to do with Michael Meyers or Laurie Strode . They wisely returned to the original story in part IV , even going so far as to attach the subtitle ' The Return of Michael Meyers ' and put a big picture of his mask on the movie's poster . The next Friday film does exactly the same thing , adding on the subtitle ' Jason lives , ' as though to say , ' Sorry about that last movie ! He's alive in this one ! ' I love the subtlety of these movies . So this movie is probably considered by many people , such as myself , to be the worst installment in the series , but not only because it wasn't really Jason as the killer . That's probably only about 90 % of the reason . The other 10 % is things like the ones mentioned above . Logic is abandoned even more than in the other movies ( Tommy , for example , is admitted to a mental hospital that not only exists in the exact location of the cause of his mental instability , but also allows him to keep such things as the horror movie masks that he made as a kid and , shockingly enough , a four-inch pocket-knife ) , a guy is introduced who has no part in the movie or the series other than to get killed , etc . But I think it remains a curiosity piece , in that it is so clearly an experiment by the filmmakers to try something a little different , have it fail miserably , and then promptly return to the general formula in the next movie .
544585	562732	97388	3.0	Better than Titanic !	What's up with all these high schools in the movies having these insane senior trips ? The kids in Final Destination flew to Europe , and these kids go on a freaking cruise ? I went to Magic Mountain for my senior trip ! Oh , well , I guess the payback is that in the movies they all get killed . Magic Mountain sounds a lot better in that sense . By this point in the lengthy Friday the 13th saga , it's clear that even the writers of these movies ( generally the last people to catch on when they come up with idiotic ideas ) have noticed that a lot of teenagers going up to Camp Crystal Lake to be rebellious and get slashed all up is getting a little bit old , so in this installment they decided it would be a good idea to have the movie take place on a whole ship full of high school students . Moving someone like Jason Voorhees from his home on Camp Crystal Lake to an unfamiliar setting is actually a really good idea for generating more interest in the series , because although it's a given in a series like this , I think audiences always like to see familiar characters come back from other stories . So while you already know Jason is going to be in the movie because it's a Friday the 13th , you at least see him in an unfamiliar atmosphere , which removes a lot of the automatic cynicism that is now being generated toward the teenagers who are still stupid enough to go out to the lake . Now we see Jason killing all kinds of kids unsuspectingly on their school trip and then more people on the streets of New York . Amazing the things we find entertaining these days , isn't it ? There are a lot of fairly innovative deaths aboard the ship in the first half of the film , such as a guy relaxing in the sauna getting one of the hot rocks shoved through his stomach , a guy getting impaled on the communication antenna on the boat , and throat slit by a machete , an amazingly botched scene . You would think that since it was so obvious the knife didn't even touch that poor guy , they would at least not have done it in such a close-up . Ironically enough , the part that I was anticipating to be the most interesting was the least creatively done . After realizing what is going on on the boat ( meaning , after just about all of them had been killed ) , the surviving students on board get the life raft and escape , rowing out into the dark ocean in hopes of hitting land . Eventually , they see the New York City skyline and jump for joy . I was anticipating a creative and fun romp through the streets of New York , maybe with Jason confused at his surroundings and therefore going even more nuts , which would create havoc among the population . I mean , LOOK at the guy . He spent the time between the last movie and this one rotting on the bottom of the lake , and he certainly looks like it through this entire movie . Unfortunately , the filmmakers not only revealed the modesty of their budget through the lack of anything really interesting happening , they also displayed a massive lack of understanding of the geography of the city of New York . I've never even been there myself , but it seems like pretty much basic logic that they would not design the city so that the dirtiest slums had the finest waterfront property . Meaning , I doubt you could row up to New York from the ocean , right alongside the Statue of Liberty , and climb up onto land , finding yourself surrounded by endless alleyways full of things like gun-toting rapists and standing barrels of toxic waste . New York is a big city , and all cities throughout the world pretty much have to have things like this somewhere , but generally not right on the water and right next to major monuments . I happen to know , for example , that if you go to San Francisco , you won't find the crime-ridden slums right under the Golden Gate Bridge , and I doubt that you would find open barrels of toxic waste ANYWHERE . But anyway , they certainly find some room for effective comic relief ( although notably less than other films in the series ) , my favorite example of which is the scene where Jason looks curiously at a picture of a hockey player on a billboard wearing exactly the same mask that he has on , a sort of self-realization that has since been overshadowed by the T-1000 pausing to look at a metallic mannequin in Terminator 2 . I love that stuff , it gives even the most two-dimensional bad guys a sort of self-consciousness , so that they're not just mindless killing machines but have some semblance of actual thought in their heads , seeing and analyzing their surroundings and pausing when they see something that they don't understand . Makes the inhuman killers more human , you know ? Speaking of which , there was also a scene that was really funny for much the same reason , and feel free to make fun of me for seeing it this way . There's a scene pretty near the end of the film where Jason is pursuing the few remaining kids through the streets of Manhattan , and he passes by some street punks hanging out and smoking on the sidewalk and listening to some ridiculous 80s music ( ' Livin ' inna city ain't no big deal , livin ' inna city ain't no big deal . If the drugs don't getcha then the hooka's will ? . ' And so forth ? ) , and as Jason walks by , he kicks their boom-box across the sidewalk . Being tough gutterpunks , of course , they stand up and pull out their switchblades , informing Jason that he just dug his own grave . Jason's response is to turn and face them and lift up his mask so they can see his face . I liked that scene , because like the one above , it shows a self-consciousness . Jason KNOWS that he looks terrifying . He always has , and rotting on the bottom of the lake made it even worse . It also shows that he can deal with people in a way other than cutting them all up and still have it be pretty satisfying to the audience . The climax of the film is bogged down pretty badly by some heavily botched logic and another massive lack of understanding of the underbelly operations of a major city . First of all , none of the passersby up on the streets take a second look at this gigantic , wet , rotting man walking down the street with a hockey mask . I know New Yorkers can be cold and indifferent , but even THEY would not take something like THAT as normal . But even worse , as the kids escape into the underground sewage system ( which does not run through wide walkways beneath the sidewalks in ANY city that doesn't want to smell like it's own waste ) , they run into a sewage worker who informs them that the sewers ( in which they are currently standing ) fill with toxic waste every night at midnight ( ' Exactly ten minutes from now ! ' ) , and is then killed by Jason before being able to show them how to get out . I won't get into the fact that there is no imaginable reason for any underground pipe system to fill with toxic waste every night at a certain time other than to create false suspense for a movie like this , although that is most of the reason that this climax falls so completely flat . We do get something for the kids to run away from and a time-limit for them to get out of the sewer , and we do get a glimpse of Jason's hideous face as he melts into the waste , but it is a completely contrived setting that has no basis in reality , which is the one thing that always makes horror films ( or films of almost any genre , for that matter ) more effective . Friday the 13th VIII , obviously , is not very concerned with that , which makes it one of the less interesting installments in the saga , although at least it takes place in a different setting so we have a reason to slap our foreheads other than because there is yet ANOTHER group of morons going up to Camp Crystal Lake to taunt the legend of Jason Voorhees .
543851	562732	60463	3.0	Seemingly air-headed romantic comedy eventually reveals itself to be wiser than its years .	I say eventually because it takes about three quarters of the film before it appears to have a thought in its head , and even then it's not by much and only briefly . My problem with the movie is that for the vast majority of it , Doris Day's character Jenny is the typical stupid blonde , cheerfully grinning like a moron and twirling her hair , clueless to what is going on around her . I have a hard time getting over this kind of thing when I see it in the movies because I dated one or two girls that acted like that because they thought it was cute and it drives me out of my mind . It's incredible to me that the romance between Jenny and Mr . Templeton was ever considered romantic , it's so contrived and pretentious . The slapstick situations are shallowly manufactured , badly acted and thus not funny , but the heavy hand of the sixties is all over the movie , so at least it is a slightly interesting look at a different time as well as the kind of thing that was considered entertaining and romantic forty years ago . The movie takes a turn for the better when Jenny figures out what's going on by listening in on a phone call between Templeton and his military buddies and then decides to turn the tables on them , although it should be noted that during that phone call he insists that Jenny simply can't be a spy , she hasn't got the brains . She's offended and so are we , until we remember that he's right . Afterwards , she begins to display an intellect which had been largely absent thus far , but unfortunately , everyone else in the movie turns stupid in order to lead to a lot more goofy slapstick . It is telling that one of the first things that brings suspicion onto Jenny is a series of misunderstandings stemming from the fact that her dog's name is Vladimir . Strangely enough , the reason I watched the movie is because I took my girlfriend to Catalina Island recently for her birthday , and we took a tour in the exact same glass bottom boat which was used in this movie , and I thought it would be interesting to see the film shot in the boat I was sitting in , as well as to see what the astonishingly beautiful Avalon ( the tiny town on Catalina Island ) looked like in the mid 1960s . Needless to say , I was surprised to see that Avalon looks almost exactly the same , and that the glass bottom boat appears in the first five minutes or so of the movie and is never seen again . Odd that they would name the film after such an irrelevant plot device . Also don't miss the extra features on the DVD , one of which is a short video in which MGM claims that every girl's dream is to visit the MGM Studios in Culver City .
544892	562732	432291	3.0	The original film was pretty weak , and this one is a bad remake of it ?	You will know almost immediately that this movie is going to be a flop , because it opens with a trendy rock song , and anytime a horror film starts off with a KROQ song you know you're in trouble . The original film was John Carpenter's first film after Halloween and a couple of television projects , and had to have been a massive disappointment . What made someone decide to remake it is beyond me , and in retrospect , what made me decide to watch yet another goofy teenage horror remake is also distantly beyond me . Directed by the director of such gems as Stigmata , Blank Check , and various M . C . Hammer movies , the remake of The Fog makes no effort to cover up or improve upon even the most obvious weaknesses in the original film . The odd character of " Stevie Wayne , " for example , remains about unwatchable , and the rest of the movie is not much better . On the other hand , I recently watched Hostel , Eli Roth's latest excrement , so this really looks like Shakespeare in comparison . It deserves its spot on the bottom 100 ( although I'd have to see Hostel rated as the worst movie ever made in order to really believe in any bottom 100 list ? ) .
544665	562732	94588	3.0	Doesn't even live up to the awful standards of the original .	? Gator Bait 2 picks up ten years after part one left off , and the little boy from the original movie has grown up and is marrying a girl from the city named Angelique . The wedding is a particularly amusing part of the film , because not only do the bride and groom inexplicably wear dollar bills on their outfits , but the fancy wedding feast consists of a huge pile of some kind of crustacean , poured carelessly onto a folding table out of a garbage can , for crying out loud . And then for their honeymoon , this true romantic takes Angelique out into the swampy woods and teaches her how to be a redneck . But then again , this kind of thing would be expected , because on one side of the aluminum boat that took the place of the post-wedding limo is painted the old saying , ' Just Married , ' while the other side bears the charming phrase , ' Pop that cherry ! ! ' ( spoilers ) As was the case in the first film , the script is absolutely horrendous , but here , the performances were pathetic as well . It's strange that Big T's ( the little boy form part one ) new bride would have an exotic sounding name like Angelique , because this guy can hardly speak intelligibly . And how did he meet a city girl , anyway ? This guy could not possibly have been out of the woods for more than a day of his entire life , and even then only to discover that he could never survive in the civilized world . It's weird that all of the evil rednecks in this film come off as more intelligent than the supposed hero . And , as was also the case in the first film , these are some SERIOUS rednecks . Again , these people are so ugly and dumb that it's difficult to believe that they're real humans . Yes , these are the true bottom feeders of the human race , a group of men so idiotic that the leader of them , Leroy , states that ' the only way to reckon with these people is to kill them . ' They are once again the brainless , horny rednecks that we saw in part one , and evidently their goal is to murder Big T and take his city wife out into the woods and rape her ? spurred on by the fact that it was Big T's sister , Desiree , that killed Leroy's brother in part one , and also left Leroy himself out in the woods to die . So they shoot Big T and , in true James Bond form , leave him alive for some unlikely force to finish him off . It's fine that we know he won't die , but all that happens is we see him thanking some witch-doctor looking man ' for saving my life , ' as he borrows the 80-something year old man's shotgun and heads back into the woods , paddling around in circles one-handedly in another aluminum boat . The chase scenes were entertaining enough , especially given the incessant banjo soundtrack , and Angelique's nudity is still exploitative but not as much as in the original film . At least here , she's half naked because the rednecks interrupted her while she was dressing and she was forced to run wearing what she had on . Also , the way that she killed one of the rednecks with a bag full of rattlesnakes ( by far the most inbred one of the whole bunch ? except maybe for Big T ) was pretty creative , but it's strange how heartbroken Leroy was about that , seeing how he had just ruthlessly cut the throat of one of his own men . With ? Gator Bait 2 , you pretty much get what you expect . Part one actually had several redeeming values , but this one had virtually none . Everything about the relationship between Big T and Angelique is totally unconvincing , and the sheer idiocy of every single character in the film , good or bad , prevents the development of any feelings for anyone , leaving you not caring about what happens to any of them , and even more disappointed at the ending .
544715	562732	324216	3.0	Bigger , gorier , louder , faster ? and worse .	The new Texas Chainsaw Massacre , which is something of a remake but not in the same vein as simply colorizing the film , as they foolishly did with Psycho in 1998 , is another look into how audiences have changed since the early 1970s . The original Texas Chainsaw film was an instant success because so many people immediately condemned it as a grotesquely violent film that celebrated some of the most vile human behaviors imaginable . They were right about what it was , but as has for centuries been the case with literature , the fastest way for a movie to become a success is to be banned . Texas Chainsaw was never banned in America that I know of , but its reputation clearly generated much of the interest in the film . Today's audiences are obviously not as easily shocked . The film starts out great , with archive footage of a police walkthrough of the crime scene although all we really get is a look at a crime scene investigator walking down the stairs to the basement , noting things like fingernails and hair embedded in the walls . The movie then cuts to a group of kids driving across the Texas desert in the summer of 1973 to go to a Lynyrd Skynyrd concert , all the while rocking out to Sweet Home Alabama , which was released in 1974 . Not that that matters . This is not , after all , The Alabama Chainsaw Massacre , and I haven't heard it , but I doubt that Sweet Home Texas is able to create the tone and mood as well . Besides , it's one of the greatest American songs ever written , although having that song in a movie like this is about as logical as putting $2 , 000 chrome rims on an antique tractor . ( spoilers ) The first turn that this movie takes from the original is that instead of a freaky hitchhiker joining the kids on their drive and giving the audience an idea for why these people are so messed up , there is a girl who has barely escaped from the family that these kids are about to meet . Kind of like what happened in Texas Chainsaw III . This girl has been so tormented by what she has been through that she is incoherent and ultimately tells the startled kids in the van that they're all going to die , then she pulls out a gun and kills herself . Speaking of which , here's an interesting thing to consider . She gets in the van wearing this little sundress , which has no pockets . After a while , she opens her legs , reaches into her crotch , and pulls out a standard issue police handgun . Just out of curiosity , where exactly are we to assume that she pulled the gun from ? I doubt that she had a holster strapped to her inner thigh , and it's even less likely that she pulled it out of some hole in the seat of the van . Maybe they hoped people would forget about this logical oddity immediately , which would explain why we next get a view of the kids ' shocked faces through the newly formed hole in the poor girl's head . The fact that the deranged hitchhiker was replaced by a victim does even more immediate damage to the film than the colorization of Psycho , and given the fact that Hitchcock preceded the original by not one but two films in color , I should have thought it would have been obvious that it was black and white for a reason . There is a duality to everything in that film , including the lack of color . Here , the removal of the hitchhiker shows how eager the film is to get to the blood and guts and skip over bothersome things like an explanation for the cause of the carnage that is to follow . It removes the story completely from any attachment to anything that might once have actually happened , and turns it immediately into a stupid teen slasher movie . The teens involved are gradually introduced to the infamous family as they search for a police officer who is interested enough in the girl's death to come out and check out the situation . The first member of the infamous family that they meet is an invention for this version of the film - a dirty little boy wearing Austin Powers teeth . The teeth are , by the way , so fake and so obviously bought at a cheap Halloween store that I'm still not sure whether they are supposed to be the kid's real teeth or if he just likes wearing them , like how some kids keep wearing their vampire fangs after Halloween's over . I'm not sure if this is in the film's defense or just another sign of its vain attempt to shock like the original did , but it does contain the most horrendous chainsaw death of any of the five Texas Chainsaws so far . I'm referring in this case to the kid who gets hung from the chandelier , although the movie also goes to great length to bring back some of the classic torture methods from the original , reminding me that I just don't like meat hooks . Since I don't work in a slaughterhouse and never will , I would be perfectly happy to live the rest of my life and never set eyes on another meat hook . In the movies or otherwise . By far the worst crime that the movie commits is that it turns Leatherface from a truly disturbed individual and into your basic movie monster . Consider the very end , for example , when we get a close up of his face as Erin is escaping , and not only is he growling , but his eyes have changed color . Earlier he took off his mask and we saw that he has no nose , then we saw him again later with a nose and with brown eyes , now he's got fluorescent blue eyes . I have one thing to say about this and most of this movie . What the hell ?
544876	562732	120836	3.0	David Spade gets a beautiful French girl to fall in love with him . It seems that none of the filmmakers really stopped to think about that part .	David Spade is a very funny man , but his brand of comedy gets real old real quick . He admittedly relies largely on his weaknesses to be funny . You know , the sarcasm , the blow-dried hair , the all-around geekiness . Unfortunately , it seems that he never really tried to develop his acting skills . I have laughed myself to tears because of David Spade in his two best movies , Black Sheep and Tommy Boy ( in both of which he played virtually that exact same character ) , but Lost & Found just wasn't amusing to me . Too much reliance on fourth grade humor and not enough of anything new for anything really good to be said of the film . And what was Sophie Marceau thinking ? ! She went from playing a significant ( although relatively small ) role in the spectacular 1995 epic Braveheart to this garbage ? She must have been pretty desperate . Sure , she looked good in the movie , but the film itself is totally inconsequential and immediately forgettable . David Spade revealed in interviews just before the theatrical release of Lost & Found that he was worried about how the public would react to an actor with his iconography actually getting the girl , and frankly , I think he should have thought about that a long time ago . Watching David Spade kiss someone as stunningly beautiful as Sophie Marceau is like watching a junior high school kid make out with a 30 year old woman . Disturbing , to say the least . The entire film was a jumbled mess of goofy and pointless jokes and bonehead antics , mainly on the part of Spade , as he tries to keep his idiot dog-napping scheme a secret . The gay jokes , the making fun of the foreign guy ( whether he deserved it or not ) , the fact that Spade spends any amount of on-screen time at all running around naked all come together to form a boring comedy that should be blissfully ignored by everyone . Just look at the cover of the movie . David Spade is naked and covering himself with a small dog . This is not something that you want to purposely subject yourself to .
544258	562732	221218	4.0	What was all that nonsense about thrills and chills around every corner ?	I read another reviewer who recommended The Glass House because of the satisfactory performance from Leelee Sobiesky despite the fact that there is little to nothing original in the movie . With all due respect , this doesn't strike me as a very relevant statement , because it's clear that Leelee Sobiesky is a massively talented actor , but The Glass House is simply a thriller that covers no new ground , and it doesn't even put any effort into being repetitive . The main problem that I had with The Glass House is that it's one of those thrillers that builds up and builds up and builds up and then just stops , like it forgot the climax . It is a creepy movie in that it contains characters , namely Terrance Glass , the parental guardian with serious money problems , who are so creepy as people that they are almost cartoonish . This is a man the likes of which exists nowhere on the face of the earth but in cheesy thrillers like The Glass House . Leelee Sobieski plays a teenage girl named Ruby whose parents are tragically killed in a car accident . When she and her younger brother are placed with foster parents , friends of the family , it becomes increasingly suspicious that they are the very people that killed them or had them killed . So this is where I get confused . The movie struck remarkably little interest with me , but from what I got , Terrance had the parents killed because he needed money , although we never really find out why . His living accommodations certainly do not suggest a lack of income . There were scenes where he was thrown against walls and whatnot by lowlifes who were demanding money , but my understanding was that they were demanding payment for pulling off the murder of the two parents . So here's my question , and I would appreciate anyone who can set me straight on the matter . Since Terrance and his wife can afford a house as massive as the one in which they live ( as well as a variety of badass sports cars , which include a flashy Jaguar and a freaking Ferrari Testarossa ) , why are they in need of money , if not to pay off the killers ? If the money is NOT to pay off the killers , why did they need money in the first place ? Were they in debt ? Was Terrance so in love with his Testarossa that he would rather have a close friend killed than sell it to help pay off his debt ? I'm sure I'm just missing something there , so it doesn't really bother me too much , but Terrance's cheesy creepiness ( consider , for example , the scene where he swerves recklessly into oncoming traffic and then skids onto the side of the road , only to reach over and buckle Ruby's seat belt as though everything's normal ) by itself reduces the film the b-movie obscurity . Oh , and never mind the way he talks . Can't they create a bad guy without making him talk like Darth friggin ' Vader ? I can't say that The Glass House is not entertaining , because it is , but even that ends up counting against it in the end . The movie most certainly is intriguing , because it piques your curiosity as to why there is so much deception and murder in it , and we want to know the real motives and who the real killers are and all that ( or if the parents were really killed at all ) , but like I said before , the movie builds up literally until the point where it ends , leaving us with the feeling that we just watched an entire movie waiting for a revelation that was never revealed . If you're in the mood for a thriller , watch Clay Pigeons or something . The Glass House plays like the script had a lot of stones thrown at it .
544406	562732	118364	4.0	Surprisingly boring , by-the-numbers sitcom ?	I saw bits and pieces of Just Shoot Me back when it was on the air so I was eager to get the dvds and check it out for real . I'm a big fan of David Spade's and I'll admit that he was the only reason I bought it , but after watching the first couple seasons I was really surprised at how flat and contrived it is . All of the characters are two-dimensional types ? the filthy rich boss who is lovable even with all of his quirks ( like marrying a woman younger than his daughter ) , you have the boss's daughter anxiously trying to prove she deserves her job beyond the fact that her father owns the magazine , the office slut ( male and female ) , and the witty photographer . The last one is at least a unique character , but still fulfills a pretty thinly veiled niche on the show . Granted , 30 minute sitcoms don't have a history of being the most interesting and complex shows , but Just Shoot Me appears to be shot on a cheaply constructed set and generally takes on cheesy , boring stories , most of which don't go beyond the superficial stories that magazines like Blush generally feature . I remember when I was in high school I once dated this girl who was constantly reading this god-awful magazine called " YM , " which is essentially a glamour magazine for teenagers , and it seems like every single issue that she ever read featured a story on some variation of " What He's REALLY Thinking About , " or some other such nonsense . That was more than ten years ago , and watching this show gives me the feeling that they're still writing that same story . In the show's defense , there are definitely some redeeming moments . It's hard to get David Spade on screen for an entire series and not have some laugh out loud moments , but I have to say that Nina Van Horn's sluttiness and belligerent flirting got real old real quick . To me , her name was about enough . Lauren San Giacomo is given nothing to do except recite her lines and bear goofy jokes about her breasts . She's probably the biggest talent wasted on the show . Despite my lack of interest , I can still tell that there is an audience for this show who will , of course , enjoy it much more than I did . It's essentially a portrayal of someone's idea of what goes on behind the scenes at a fashion magazine . Throw in David Spade with a bunch of models , who generally parade silently across the set , pausing only to evade Spade's ludicrous advances , and you have yourself a sitcom . But if , like me , you don't care what goes on behind the scenes at a fashion magazine , don't bother .
544052	562732	70016	4.0	They got the spider all wrong ?	I have studied Shakespeare , so I understand the value of literature that leaves open veritably endless possibilities for individual interpretation of the original work , so normally I wouldn't say anything about an animated version of Charlotte's Web featuring a Charlotte that doesn't look anything like the one illustrated in E . B . White's classic children's book or the one that I imagined while reading it ( which , surprise surprise , was remarkably like the one illustrated in the book ) . The reason that I point this out here is because I have also studied Charlotte's Web at the University level , and have learned that E . B . White went through several illustrators before finally finding one that got the spider to look the way he wanted her to look . And yes , by the way , there are classes at the University level in which Charlotte's Web is required reading , as is Alice In Wonderland , Through The Looking Glass , Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone ( or Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone , if you're not a stupid American like me ) , Captain Underpants , etc . A small amount of research into the history of Charlotte's Web would surely have revealed White's specific requirement that Charlotte look like a real spider , not a cute Disney spider with a bowl cut , a nice smile , and big blue eyes . Adorable , but her appearance here rather defeats the purpose . There are other discrepancies in the movie that take unnecessary artistic liberties from the book , and while some of them I can understand being changed ( such as the fact that Avery , Fern's brother , is introduced skipping happily down the stairs with a big smile rather than as heavily armed as he is when he's introduced in the book ) , other changes had a serious affect on the story as a whole . Wilbur's maturation , like Fern's , is in fast forward and altered all along the way . As soon as he gets to the farm , he misses Fern so much that he won't eat as soon as he's moved to the farm , because he knows that he's been sold and taken away from Fern . In the book he eats so greedily that he buries his head far enough into his food to get it into his ears , and the narrative presents his thoughts , so we know that Wilbur is at least an intelligent creature , even though he doesn't speak out loud at first . The thing that is lost in the movie version is that , since we can't hear his thoughts , the scene where he learns to speak comes off as contrived and ridiculous . The goose tells him that he has to TRY to speak , so he barely manages to snort out his name , and 15 seconds later he's singing ( with a startling vocabulary ) a song all about how amazing it is that he can talk . Not only can he talk , but he can dance and sing showtunes , too ! The lengthy and complicated words that are thrown in for the benefit of Wilbur's song also take away from the effect of the story as a whole , because despite spouting these huge words and even rhyming them together , he later has no idea what Charlotte is talking about when she says ' Salutations ' ( or , later , ' versatile ' ) , a greeting that is meant to signify her intelligence in the book because no words like it had been used up to that point in the story ( not quite so in the movie , is it ? ) . This problem is compacted by the fact that Charlotte can rattle off two definitions for ' Humble ' but can't think of a single word to describe Wilbur without having Templeton find a piece of paper with writing on it . Another thing that really bothered me was the way the relationship between Fern and Henry Fussy ultimately played out . This was one of the questionable things in the original novel , and not only is this romantic relationship between these two 8-year-olds not subdued in the movie version , it is enhanced . Henry shows up at the fair near the end of the movie ( looking startlingly different from the last time that he is shown ) , and Fern winks at him , he tells her that he has some money and wants to take her on the Ferris-wheel , and they leave hand in hand , talking like 16-year-olds rather than the 8-year-olds that they are . Wilbur then cries to Charlotte that Fern didn't even say goodbye to him when she left , and Charlotte reassures him by telling him that Fern will always love him , but that ' She's growing up . She's suddenly seeing Henry Fussy with new eyes . ' Suddenly is right ! There are a few very important lines from the original story that are placed directly into the movie , such as Fern complaining about the injustice of Wilbur being killed for being small at the beginning , and the very last line of the movie , about Charlotte being both a good friend and a good writer , but this only begins to make up for the things that were added or changed in the movie . The usual musical numbers that are found in every animated Disney movie regardless of content are here , and they aren't ALL completely cutesy and contrived ( although Wilbur's ' I Can Talk ' song is unforgivable ) , but they are definitely typical Disney fodder . The structure of the story is here , but there are some very important things that are changed for the benefit of being a Disney movie . This is , after all , a DISNEY adaptation of a children's literary classic . No less , and , most importantly , no more .
543937	562732	397065	4.0	" Pinch this tiny heart of mine , wrap it in up soiled twine , you never read what you've written ? "	As has become the standard for modern horror films , this sub-par House of Wax remake ( as I call it having yet to see the original ) begins with an introduction of a meaningless group of stupid college-age kids , and then promptly allows us to get to know them just enough to ensure that they are all thoroughly unlikable . I'm not sure why so much effort was put into making them all into such distasteful characters , but my current theory is that it is simply a misguided attempt to keep some element of mystery in the movie , since you already know they'll be killed off one by one . In the movie's defense , a good story involves good character change , and it cannot be denied that there is plenty of that here , it's just too bad that's not all there is . I'm reminded of the ridiculous horror film Wrong Turn , which featured an equally meaningless group of college-age kids getting lost in the woods and being confronted by some clownishly made-up in-bred rednecks who gleefully off all of the unfortunate kids stuck in the big bad woods . That and Texas Chainsaw III , but I digress . As I am led to believe was also the case , to a certain extent , at least , in the original film , the remake concerns a deserted town in which there can be found a wax museum whose feature displays are so realistic because there are real people beneath the wax coating , presumably embalmed in the wax yet slowly rotting away . The biggest advance that this film makes is in some truly revolting scenes , such as a scene where one of the kids is made into a wax sculpture and his friend tries to free him , only peeling the skin off his face as he tries to get the wax off of him . On the other hand , there are also some thoroughly botched scenes , like the one where a girl gets the tip of her finger cut off and it bubbles over with blood like a fountain . Tom Savini , who was doing better gore effects than this two and a half decades ago , would be appalled . Remember in House of the Dead when those kids went to that island for the rave of the century , found it completely deserted , and didn't really seem to be bothered ? It's kind of the same here , they take a detour on their way to a big football game get lost on a detour and decide to camp in the scary , smelly , creepy woods . They smell the smell of decaying flesh , and a pickup truck pulls up and shines its brights at them , no one getting out or responding when they call to them . Nick , the biggest jerk of the lot already , hauls off and throws a bottle at the truck , smashing one of the headlights . Let me tell you something , you do not get away with that in the country . The driver doesn't even have to be a crazed killer to jump out and knock your block off . Instead , the truck ominously drives away , leaving the kids convinced that the situation is under control , so they settle down for the night . After later running into the guy in the pickup truck as he dumps dead animals onto a massive pile of rotting dead animals ( hence the smell of the woods ) , they smartly decide to hitch a ride with him to town to buy a fanbelt to replace the one that snapped in their truck while it was parked the night before . The town they get a ride to turns out to be a forgotten relic of the 1960s , which " doesn't even show up on the GPS but is remarkably maintained . No one's walking around the town but there are plenty of people at the funeral home , including one man , incredulous that they would interrupt his grandmother's funeral but who soon recovers and agrees to offer them what turns out to be a lot of waxy help . After this point , the movie runs parallel to countless other movies college kids get lost in the woods , one gets kidnapped , and the rest get killed one by one . At the moment I'm thinking of Texas Chainsaw 4 , by far the worst of them all , including the ludicrous 2003 remake . You'll yawn through the rest of the film , if you haven't yawned through it so far , although there are some impressive special effects with the wax , some I've mentioned already , including an obviously CG but still interesting climax , which describes the fate of the House of Wax . Essentially , it's just another bad slasher movie from the 1980s , but with Paris Hilton and , the one thing that has caused horror films to lose their souls , computer generated special effects . This is certainly not the worst modern horror movie you could watch , I'm mentioned in this review some that are at least as bad and some far worse ( like House of the Dead ) , it's just so tiring to see yet another one come out with so little thought or effort put into it .
544772	562732	339147	4.0	What a disappointment .	I forget what movie it was that I rented that had a preview for this one included on the DVD , but I saw the preview for this film and for Grand Theft Parsons , which I would otherwise not have looked twice at because Johnny Knoxville stars in it , but they both looked like pretty good movies , so I rented this one . Big mistake . Jim Caviezel , who will probably spend the rest of his career being known as the guy who played Jesus in The Passion of the Christ , plays James Cray here , a man determined to capture the man who deliberately killed his wife in a hit and run accident . The best thing that the movie has going for it is that it has flickers of strength periodically displayed in the structure of the story , which gradually reveals meaning within its ugly occurrences . It is revealed more than midway through the film that after his wife was struck and killed , Rennie chased down the perpetrating vehicle , ultimately slamming into the side of it and landing himself in prison for three years and the murderer of his wife in all kinds of traction . The movie itself is some bizarre mixture of the basic , basic premise from Duel combined with elements of other bad thrillers like Crash and Wheels of Terror , a very obscure TV movie by which I happen to have had the great pleasure of being horribly bored . The problem is that it tries to create a human story behind what Rennie has been through , but then throws in this antagonist that is literally nothing more than a horror movie monster . He is not a car crash victim or a sick murderer who gets thrills from killing women with his car , he is a movie monster like the boss from The Mangler . It's hard to take a movie like this seriously when it's main opposing force is someone who is barely human and whose gigantic boat of a Cadillac is entirely indestructible . In thinking back on the level of misogyny displayed in the film , I am reminded of Pedro Almodóvar's 1986 film Matador , the opening scene of which I found so tremendously distasteful that I only made it about three minutes into the film before turning it off in disgust . I can scarcely imagine the remainder of Matador being able to justify the hideous nature of its opening sequence , but even with the much more subtle level of misogyny ( if it should even be called that ) displayed in this film is not justified by the rest of the movie . This is a very low-level thriller whose less-than-impressive performances deserved a better film . Avoid this one .
544855	562732	69332	4.0	Sample dialogue : ' You'd give all this up ? 8-track stereo , color TV in every room ? it's the American dream ! '	First you have to get over how catastrophically obsolete this film is , and then it might be enjoyable on some deep , subconscious level . Having watched it and learned that it was one of the most controversial blaxploitation films of the 70s , I am a little hesitant to write a scathing review of it , since I'm sure it has some sort of cult following somewhere , but the movie is so badly made and so goofy that it's almost impossible to praise it . I was also shocked to read one IMDb reviewer call the soundtrack one of the greatest in film history . Way off , buddy , but I am willing to admit that at one point , presumably early 1970s , this kind of music was considered great , but today it is so preposterous that it's almost weird . And by the way , I'd like to once again protest the word blaxploitation , an utterly meaningless description used to describe something which strikes me as something similar to those FUBU clothes , or rap music . By black people , for black people , so who they're exploiting and for whom is beyond me . Being mostly white myself , I'm outside the target audience , but I decided to watch it because I think that ancient styles are so funny . See the teenagers in 80s teen comedies or horror movies , for instance . Speaking of ancient styles , it's interesting to notice how much the typical audience has evolved over the years since Super Fly was made . A director today , for example , could never get away with making a movie like this , modern audiences just don't have the attention span . The movie moves along like a series of music videos , stopping periodically to insert some dialogue and characters and situations , after which it moves back into another music video . Even that sex scene in the bathtub seemed to go on forever , panning up and down and up and down and up and down the naked bodies in the tub , presumably long enough for the song to play out before we can move on to the next scene . From a technical standpoint , the film is an absolute disaster . There's a foot-chase early in the movie during which a wire of some sort falls directly in front of the camera lens not once , but twice , the audio is numerous scenes does not even remotely match the video ( the never-ending bathtub scene , for example ) , and the acting is abysmal . ( spoilers ) The story is about a drug dealer who wants to do the One Last Gig And Then Get Out For Good , and runs into all kinds of obstacles along the way . All of which , of course , are obstacles just long enough to create some periodic dialogue scenes and then become solved when it's time for the plot to move along . The ending has something of a twist , I suppose , although that may be because I was envisioning a bit of a tragic ending because of the way things were leading , but the movie as a whole is a tired , plodding exercise through the jive of the streets of the big city in the early 1970s , with lots of badass blacks and evil white cops screwing everything up . I don't like the way the black people were portrayed in the film , as far as being dedicated dope smugglers and cocaine dealers and whatnot , but I still don't think that the term blaxploitation is appropriate , because you have to admit that Priest's intentions were honorable . Sure , he had been leading a less than honorable life and had less than honorable means for getting out of it , but the important thing is that he wanted to get out , he wanted to change his life for the better . I think the only way that blaxploitation can be used to accurately describe movies like this is in the way stereotypes are used as a starting point for the story . Lots of black criminals , basically . I've heard that Denzel Washington has talked about doing a remake of this movie with the director of Training Day . Given how far Denzel has fallen in his acting career because he keeps making the same movie over and over , it seems that he doesn't care as much about where his career goes from now on . Surely he has more than enough money to last the rest of his life , but why would he want to do something as crazy as that ? Did he not see the train wreck that was Samuel L . Jackson's remake of Shaft ?
544800	562732	963178	4.0	Most expensive movie I've slept through this year .	Tom Tykwer's The International came about with a lot of promise . It has all the makings of a classy , intelligent espionage thriller . I was expecting something in the vein of The Interpreter or at least some of the fast-paced action of the Bourne films , but such is not to be the case . The movie pitts Clive Owen , a cinematic force to be reckoned with , to be sure , against the villainously corrupt international banking infrastructure , which seems to have acquired a taste for enormous missile deals . Unfortunately , the movie plods through every imaginable espionage cliché , and somehow manages to make it's two hours feel like about five . And Tom Tykwer hasn't done anything interesting since his brilliant film Run Lola Run in 1998 , so it wasn't exactly a good career move to make such a high-profile and profoundly uninteresting film as this . Maybe it's because I'm an American who hasn't lived in America for a few years and so the economic crisis doesn't have much of an immediate scariness for me , but for whatever reason , I found the economic string-pulling here to be decidedly unthreatening . Clive Owen stars as Louis Salinger , a former Scotland Yard detective now working for Interpol and hot on the trail of what he is sure is a massive conspiracy of corruption and murder taking place within the banking industry . Naomi Watts is Eleanor Whitman , an American somehow involved with the New York District Attorney's office , who for some reason wants her to spend her time and energy to track down European banking criminals . You may find yourself spending the first half of the movie feverishly trying to follow the twists and turns of the plot and keep track of all of the intricacies of wrongdoing that grows deeper and deeper with every scene , but by about the hour mark it becomes pretty clear that the movie isn't going to do anything new , and isn't even going to try to cover the well - treaded ground that it covers in any kind of fresh or interesting way . It seems that an international bank called the IBBC has been engaging in shady arms deals which turn out to be efforts to control the debt created by international conflicts . " Control the debt , " we learn , " and you control everything . " I never really thought about it that way , although it does put my credit card debt in an entirely new perspective . I better pay that thing off , or I'm pretty sure I'm going to be somehow funding terrorist organizations . Unfortunately , the banks in The International are so cartoonishly villainous that it makes the movie almost impossible to take seriously . Of course , economists have analyzed the plot and assured us that such things could never happen in the real world , but for a movie like this to really be effective , it helps if the premise is at least a little bit believable . Banks are all around us and are not exactly in favor at the moment , but do they have to be portrayed as the epitome of soulless , power-hungry war-mongers that will stop at nothing , even such trifles as high-profile , public assassinations , in order to pursue their criminal designs ? Clive Owen's biggest task in the movie is to sell his astonishment at the mind-boggling revelation that money and power do , in fact , breed corruption , and Naomi Watts ' biggest task in the movie is to somehow come across as the slightest bit interesting when she bravely states that she intends to " blow this thing wide open . " Yawn . Am I getting spoiled ? Am I expecting too much from the movies ? There are few things I hate more than people who are totally ungrateful for what they have in life , but am I wrong to expect more from the movies than something like this ? Maybe I just expected a totally different pace in The International . The movie moves so slowly and ploddingly that by the time the climax finally lumbers across the screen I was spending almost as much time looking at my watch as I was spending looking at the movie . I kid you not , less than five minutes before the movie ended , in the heat of the climax of the film , I was distracted by a text message from my friend . It seemed that he was suffering from a terrible case of intestinal gas and was getting pretty anxious about the implications that it would have for the yoga class that he was about to teach . I texted him back the most reassuring message I could think of and then came back to the movie and discovered that I hadn't missed much . There is also little the matter of the Big Shootout . I don't want to ruin anything for you , but personally I am of the opinion that if I don't tell you that a two hour movie about banking corruption manages to culminate in a machine gun battle in none other than New York's Guggenheim Museum , I would be doing you a grave disservice . I've visited the Guggenheim's in Los Angeles and Bilbao , Spain , and while I haven't been to the one in New York , my understanding is that the resemblance of the re-created version for this movie is astonishing . Unfortunately , the mind-numbing machine gun battle that takes place in it is not .
544203	562732	1104006	4.0	Yeah , I felt a little walled in myself ?	Walled In is the kind of horror film that sets itself up in a bizarre location and then explains all kinds of bizarre rules to make the scariness work . The movie opens with a series of headlines that explain the terrible discovery of 16 bodies cemented into the walls of a building , including that of the architect who designed it . We learn that the person who walled them in , Joseph Malestrazza , was never caught , and then we cut to 15 years later , when the building is planned to be demolished . Mischa Barton stars as Samantha , a young member of the demolition company family , perfectly named the Walczak's ( the ' c ' is silent ) . She recently graduated from engineering school and it becomes her first lone assignment to visit the building and supervise its demolition . It's a perfect set-up for a horror movie , I suppose , although as soon as we get to the building , the one where the 16 bodies were discovered , you remember , and learn that the wife and son of the murdered architect are still living there , the movie takes a pretty serious turn for the worse . I would think that if a man suffered the terrible fate of being murdered and cemented into the walls of a building , his wife would take it upon herself not to raise their son for his entire life in that building . But that's me . Upon her arrival we meet the woman living there and her creepy son , who explains things to Samantha that the lights go off every six minutes to conserve energy , she shouldn't go to the 8th floor ( that's Malestrazza's quarters , you see , and it's never cleaned ) , and whatever you do don't go on the roof ! I would think that someone planning the demolition of a building would explain the logical deficiency of avoiding certain parts of it , but we understand that this is a horror movie and these goofy rules he's explaining are a set-up for freaky sequences that are to follow . There's also the issue of a few remaining people who lived in the building and who are not likely to appreciate Sam arriving to destroy it . The young boy also worries that Malestrazza will be offended by her plans . I was reminded of the brilliant novel House of Leaves in a lot of things about the movie . Sam discovers enormous discrepancies between the blueprints and the actual measurements of the house , which in that book led to a fascinating and frightening series of events , but in the movie leads to the cheap and utterly witless third act . There is also a lot of throwbacks to Psycho in the relationship between the young boy and his mother in an isolated location . Sam even describes the building as being " like the Bates Motel , only bigger , " and at one point the mother forbids her son to go near Sam , telling him that Sa could never take care of him the way she does . Creepy . Ultimately we learn about an " ancient architectural belief " that provides the reason that Malestrazza killed people and walled them into his buildings ( and also the reason why not one of the 27 buildings that Malestrazza built have ever been torn down ) . It gives the movie the feel of something with more thought in it that it actually has . I felt a little flicker of interest when this was revealed , but in retrospect it strikes me as little more than a screenwriters brainstorm . I understand that Walled In is based on a novel , and I hope the novel is better than the movie . Books , especially horror books , are always better than the movie , ad if someone read the book and thought it was good enough to make into a film , it must have been better than this movie , because it has all the sign-posts of a weak horror film . It's full to the brim with cheap scares ( notice the Screeching Cat Scare , which at least was made a little bit different but essentially is the same old thing , and my favorite , a scary rose scare . You have to see that one to believe it ) and blatantly rips off a whole series of other horror movies . I'm curious what the movie would have looked like had director Gilles Paquet-Brenner never seen Psycho , Texas Chainsaw , and the Nightmare on Elm Street films . He even uses that " One , Two , Freddy's Coming For You " song several times . Real creative there , buddy . I won't go into the details of the end of the film partly because I don't want to ruin it for you but mostly because it's so dumb that I don't want to bother spending my time explaining it . I will tell you one thing though . There's a particularly amusing scene where the boy accuses Samantha of thinking that he's nothing but a " crazy little boy . " You gotta see this scene , man , it's hilarious . At the time that he says that to her , I won't tell you what he happens to be doing , but when you make a statement like that , it's generally not a good time to be acting like a crazy little boy . What follows that scene is a third act that is not entirely without effect , but definitely one of the dumbest situations that I've seen in a horror movie in some years . It is so bizarre and makes so little sense that the movie almost becomes a mystery . Another mystery is why the thing got made in the first place , but sadly , after seeing the movie , I don't think I'm every going to be able to bring myself to read the book ?
543961	562732	173840	5.0	Yet another overblown movie based on a video game .	Almost immediately after the release and failure of the highly overrated Tomb Raider comes the release of Final Fantasy : The Spirits Within . While Final Fantasy wasn't nearly as bad as Tomb Raider , the spiritual element made up far too much of the story for the film as a whole to be taken seriously . The religious aspect is unmistakable and almost suffocating , as Aki and Dr . Sid and the others search feverishly for the spirits that are expected to collectively eliminate all of the invading phantoms . There are many other heavily religious allusions , not the least of which is the basic good vs . evil story structure and the clearly Satanic appearance of the phantoms themselves . One of the great ironies of computer animation , that this film in particular brings to attention , is the fact that the better it gets , the less necessary it is . Sure , there are things that can be done with computer animation that would be impossible to film with real actors , but Final Fantasy looked so real that many of the scenes may as well have been real . On the other hand , humans have been particularly troublesome in computer animated films - they just never quite look right . But here , they are so real that it is unnerving , but this time , they screwed up the humans MOVEMENTS . No matter how real they looked in the movie , the actual motion was still entirely robotic . Besides that , it was a mistake to have so many well known actors lending their voices to the film , because all that did was take voices that we know and put them on other people , which was distracting because the people looked so real . This all makes you wonder when full-length animated films will become obsolete and computer animation will be used only to add to the special effects of other movies . On the other hand , Final Fantasy did have some of the most amazing scenery ever made with computer animation . The desolated New York City was amazingly real , and the idea of the humans hiding in gigantic enclosed areas to keep safe from the phantoms was also very interesting . But in the second half of the film , this all gets a little convoluted and we see the sacrifice of the human element of the movie in favor of the competition between Dr . Sid's peaceful theory and General Hein's militaristic tactics , as the two clash at the film's climax . Final Fantasy is not a complete failure , and is far superior to it's real life counterpart , the awful Tomb Raider , but there can be no mistake that it is disappointing . Fans of the video game may enjoy it , but this is not for general audiences .
544776	562732	99180	5.0	" ? and God created woman ? "	It's murder ! It's blasphemy ! It's ? it's misogyny ! ! If ever a single line described an entire movie , that one describes Bride of Re-Animator . Not that it's a direct quote , but close . Dr . Herbert West is back and crazier than ever , having become less of a scientist desperately pursuing work that is highly unethical but which he truly believes can help mankind in the end and more of a mad scientist who just wants to see dead people walking around . In the original film he had a vicious intelligence that made you want to see him succeed in conquering death , but here all he really wants to do is piece pieces of dead people together , pour his chem-light juice on them and watch them walk around . When on earth else would he put some fingers together with an eyeball on top and animate the pieces into a grotesque walking spider ? Not that that was entirely unappreciated . I always enjoy comic relief in horror movies , and this one is even campier than its predecessor , which is a camp classic . But when making a sequel to a camp classic , I think it is just a little bit dangerous to take the material even less seriously than the first movie . The zombies are smarter in this one ( " My god , they're using tools ! " ) and the experiments more extreme , like piecing together a woman from a whole array of parts from half a dozen different people , but it is harder to take Dr . West seriously even as a horror movie scientist when he proudly points at his hideous monster of a creation and mocks what God or woman can produce . The music is still an unveiled rip-off of the Psycho soundtrack , but at least it is kept mostly to the very beginning and very end of the movie , rather than played almost nonstop like it was in the first movie . But what was most irritating was the severed head that kept popping up throughout the movie , talking in a raspy voice which I imagine was meant to be scary but comes off as ridiculous because of the lack of vocal cords , to say nothing of the lack of lungs to push air over them . The goofy , toothy performance was just too much for me . Man , that head would just not go away . The end of the movie turns into a reanimating free-for-all , where all intent on helping mankind by beating death is forgotten in favor of piecing together human body parts in as many different combinations as possible , resulting in things like a man who is nothing but a head , a right arm , a right leg backwards for a left arm , and a breast growing out of his shoulder . It's like a sick version of that head and shoulders thing that Chatterer had been reduced to in Hellraiser Inferno . Anyway , the movie has completely lost direction by this point and become little more than a gory mishmash of the premise that the series was originally based on . Gore fans may get a kick out of that , but I get the feeling that true Re-Animator fans would be offended that the original classic film was reduced to that level .
544090	562732	130121	5.0	This is even bad for a Hugh Grant movie .	Hugh Grant is widely considered to be one of the more aggravating actors working today . He constantly plays roles which are really only thinly disguised caricatures of the same dainty British guy who has managed to get himself in over his head . Like Woody Allen , his movies are also packed full of little good-naturedly sarcastic one-liners which , ironically , are often the funniest parts of his films . In the James Bond films , the constant barrage of one-liners serve to do little more than remove any scrap of respectability from the films and reduce them to childish excursions full of meaningless sexual innuendos , while in films like Mickey Blue Eyes , these one-liners are quite often genuinely amusing , and some of the better parts of the movie . As the rest of the movie will show , however , having successful one-liners does not by any stretch of the imagination make for a good movie . Grant plays the role of Michael Felgate , an art dealer with a stable career and high hopes of an approaching marriage . He goes through his life happily , running auctions at which he sells obscure paintings for obscene amounts o f money , spending time with his significant other , Gina Vitale ( Jeanne Tripplehorn - I'll get to her later ) , and occasionally dropping amusing wise-cracks . In other words , he's pretty much a regular guy . The introduction of the conflict in the film comes from his efforts to get Gina to agree to marry him . When Michael makes a charming but vain attempt to propose to her through a note inserted into a fortune cookie , Gina freaks out and storms out of the restaurant , telling Michael that she can't , she just can't , leaving him alone in the restaurant and leaving the audience wondering what her intentions had been thus far in the relationship if marriage was so simply out of the question . Besides the botched romance , Tripplehorn delivers an absolutely abysmal performance as the poor poor daughter of the mobster who is just so devastated that she can't marry her true love . She plays the victim well enough , but it's just groan-inducing to watch her make horribly vain attempts to act emotional scenes . Every time she got upset I just wanted to leave the room . The conflict has been thus introduced - Gina can't marry Michael because there are things about her family that he doesn't know about and that she is ashamed to have him discover , which is why she stomped out of the restaurant as though he had admitted cheating on her rather than proposed to her . So after she changes her mind and decides to stay with him just as fast as she rejected him , Michael decides to take it upon himself to get to know her family and thereby resolve any conflict that Gina may have been concerned about . What you have here is a typical formula comedy that unrepentedly feeds off of the stereotypical Italian mafia family , basically stealing the formula from the classic comedies ( namingly The Odd Couple , the formula of which has probably been imitated on a plot level more than any other in cinematic history ) and adding it to the only bad thing about The Godfather , which is the fact that it presented a tremendously stereotypical account of Italians as criminals . Mickey Blue Eyes does nothing new , but rather adds the typical Hugh Grant character to the above borrowed formulas , resulting in a significantly disappointing comedy . The only mildly amusing things in this film are Michael's occasional witty comments , which are punctuated by a series of painfully unamusing scenes - such anything involving the butchering of a foreign accent or a Chinese restaurant owner screaming at Gina to eat fking cookie . It's amazing to me that that ridiculous scene made it into this film . For the most part , they at least got their stereotypical representation of the Italian crime family at least partially right . And by that , of course , I mean that they did a god job stealing the traditional hierarchy of Hollywood's version of Italian crime families , and Mickey Blue Eyes does more than it's part to ensure the world that there are no other types of Italian families than this . As far as the performances , not everything was bad . Jeanne Tripplehorn , as I've already mentioned , immensely over-acted her role , reducing her performance almost to farce , and Hugh Grant was horribly miscast from the outset , but there are some performances in the film that are worth noting . Joe Viterelli , who amazingly manages to look decades younger than he is , is back in basically the exact same role that he played in Analyze This , an immensely superior film . James Caan delivers a performance as Gina's mob father that is just about as fantastic as the material will allow , and more than any other , Burt Young as Vito Graziosi , sort of the head of the family , performs so well in his role that he deserves to be in a far better film . It's too bad that Mickey Blue Eyes turned out to be such a spectacular failure , because it works from a premise that could have made for a much better film . In a way , this movie failed in exactly the same way that Hollow Man did - there were nearly endless possibilities , but they were all ignored in favor of the childish slop that you see in the final cut . We can hope that someday someone will steal the premise of this movie and make that better film , but the unfortunate fact is that this is just not the kind of film that strikes filmmakers as something to borrow from . Ah , well . . .
544613	562732	78437	5.0	Good clean cannibal fun !	Last Cannibal World claims to be a true story about a stone-age cannibal tribe living on the Malaysian island of Mindanao who captures a ' modern ' man named Robert Haper , who crash lands on the island . It seems that there is an oil mining crew camping out in the jungle while they search for drilling sites , and when a team flies in to check on them , the plane is damaged during landing and the drill team turns up missing . The pilot is sure he can fix the plane ( " If I can find the wheel it shouldn't be too hard to put it back again ! " ) , but won't fly until the following day , since it was getting dark . Before long , of course , the group ends up separated and being pursued by cannibals through the jungle , and then the movie becomes a strange mix of gruesome horror and a twisted look at the animal side of humans . Of course , cannibalism is not politically correct , so the cannibal tribe is presented as more like animals than humans , with the grunting and the throwing food at each other and the spontaneous copulation . These are evolutionary drop-outs if ever there were any , but the movie doesn't know where to stop in presenting their backwardness . Even the simplest animals have some instincts , particularly about things like eating and self-preservation , but not these people . One of the women tries to eat Harper's wristwatch , I suppose not possessing the basic abilities to distinguish between food items and non-food items , and for a tribe that has been living presumably for centuries or more in an alligator infested jungle , they sure spend a lot of time swimming and getting eaten or almost eaten by alligators . A woman gives birth by the riverside and , after detaching the umbilical cord with her teeth ( and after an extreme close-up to make sure we know the baby is a girl ? I didn't need that ? ) , she goes for a nice little swim and gets immediately eaten along with her new baby . Smart . Gore fans should be happy , there is sufficient disturbing gore in the movie , although most of the effects ( such as the decomposed head in the beginning ) are pretty weak , as is the editing . But there is lots of grotesque feeding scenes which include lots of filthy savages stuffing flesh in their mouths with lots of nasty sucking sounds and twitching meat . Nice ! Some of the movie doesn't make much sense , like the way they tie up one of the natives and put carnivorous ants on his arms , which slowly eat him while he screams his head off . It's one of the more disturbing scenes in the movie with all that screaming , but why would they do that ? I thought it must be a sacrifice , but what kind of tribe sacrifices their own people rather than animals ? And who is he being sacrificed to ? The Ant God ? Even if he was being punished , for a cannibal tribe to feed a man to ants seems like a waste of food , doesn't it ? Harper spends a good part of the movie trapped in a cage , although I missed the reason for that too . They couldn't have been fattening him up to eat him because that would also be a huge waste of food . Maybe they were saving him for a special occasion . At any rate , they put in this bizarre looking bird with him , and it's strange that when Harper kills it , its squawking instantly stops and gives the scene a genuine finality of death that is more realistic than anything else in the movie . At least until it starts squawking again . There are two directions that the movie could go once a " sympathetic " jungle woman begins helping Harper ? it could have Harper try to lift the woman out of the barbaric world in which she lives , or he could descend into barbarism himself . The most interesting thing that the movie does is that it goes in both directions , and actually does it pretty well . It's a pretty sharp indictment of Harper ( especially if this really is a true story ) , given that , even after saving her from being sexually assaulted by another native , he rapes her himself . And he didn't just force himself on her , her beat her and then raped her . Are we still supposed to accept him as a protagonist ? After this , it may be a little strange to see that she basically becomes his loving cave-wife , bringing him food and cleaning and caring for him , until you remember that these are savages and I guess this is just how women expect to be treated . And Harper is happy , of course , given that he has found himself a beautiful island wife , and with obviously man-made breasts , no less . There is a weak attempt at symbolism during Harper's brief descent to his most primal instincts , and then soon he meets up with another man from the plane , who laments that no matter how much mud he smears into a badly infected wound on his knee , it never gets better . He must not have been paying much attention in his Wilderness Survival class . All in all I guess the movie is as satisfying as a cannibal movie can be . At least you know what to expect , though . I think any movie with the word " cannibal " in the title is going to be pretty much like this . It's bad but it's a fun and disgusting kind of bad , the thing you can watch with your buddies over a few beers and have a few good laughs !
544798	562732	95956	5.0	" This Film Is Dedicated to the Gallant People of Afghanistan " - ' Rambo III ' Review . . .	In preparing to watch the latest installment of the Rambo series , I've gone back and re - watched all of the original three films , which I hadn't seen in probably 15 years . Unfortunately , they are so uniformly bad that it has taken me now over a year to get through the three of them . I finished watching part III today and , like the two films before it , it was a notably underwhelming cinematic experience . By this point in the series , the Rambo formula is worked out in every detail . Rambo just wants to be left alone but then gets sucked into some brutally violent situation which , again , he has to take care of all on his own . He doesn't really play well with others , you see . Just as we found him languishing in a prison labor camp at the beginning of the second movie , Rambo is now living the dubious life of a monk in Thailand who takes breaks from the monastery to head into Bangkok and make some extra money in the stick-fighting competitions , which he promptly turns over to the monks to help build the monastery . He likes the feeling of belonging that he gets from living among the monks and doesn't want to be a soldier anymore . Needless to say , when the guys with the stripes on their shoulders approach and ask for his help , he's uninterested until a mission goes forward in Afghanistan and results in the good guy from the second movie getting taken prisoner , the first American ever taken prisoner in Afghanistan . And here , just like the last movie , is where everything starts to fall apart . The first American ever captured in Afghanistan is not an enviable position , to be sure , so it's easy to understand why Rambo would make such a sudden change of heart . What is unfortunately missing is the entire rest of the American military . I'm curious about how the real members of the United States military responded to the movie , which portrays them as either helpless or completely absent . It may be , perhaps , that the mission is thought to be a lost cause or not worth the risk , so sending Rambo in must , of course , be done " unofficially . " If Rambo is caught , he is told prior to embarking on the mission , the military will deny all knowledge of his existence , which prompts Rambo to sneer and say he's used to such treatment , and then do that thing where he ties his headband on all dramatically . At any rate , it's no surprise when Rambo insists that he has to do everything on his own . If you saw the level of sheer camp that the second movie reached then you know something of what to expect here , although it should be said that Rambo III is certainly better than First Blood Part II , which is undeniably the worst film of the already unimpressive series . It is definitely interesting , however , to watch the way the Afghani people are portrayed in the movie . Rambo enters Afghanistan alone and has to make his way to where the prisoner is being kept with only a single in-country contact , who tells him all about the cultural realities on the ground for the Afghani people . Alexander the Great tried and failed to conquer the Afghans , then the British , then the Americans , and they all failed . He explains to Rambo and ancient battle prayer written by a long-since defeated enemy - " May God deliver us from the venom of the cobra , the teeth of the tiger , and the vengeance of the Afghan . " The relationship between America and Afghanistan has changed drastically over the years , and not in a good way . In fact , given that we're at war in Afghanistan right now , this movie appears strangely prophetic . If George W . Bush had re-watched Rambo III somewhere around early 2003 , it would not be a stretch to think that the situation in the middle east might be drastically different right now . " Every day your war machines lose ground to a bunch of poorly armed , poorly equipped freedom fighters . The fact is you underestimated your competition . If you'd studied your history you would know that these people have never given up to anyone . They'd rather die than be slaves to an invading army . You can't defeat a people like that ! " Believe it or not , this is not a scathing criticism of America's current war in Afghanistan , it's a scathing criticism by the American prisoner of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in the movie . It is one of the movie's strangest qualities that it pitts the Americans and the Afghans as allies against the cartoonishly villainous Soviets , who come in the form of wild-eyed lunatics at the controls of attack helicopters that buzz small villages laying waste unprovoked to whole populations of peaceful civilians . They are not just an invading force , they are airborne murderers that bombs women and children and disguise bombs as toys to trick unsuspecting children . With such enemies , it is understandable when one character ominously says , " God would have mercy , Rambo won't . . . " as Rambo sets off on his preposterous one-man mission of vengeance against the invading Soviets . It's interesting that the movie makes so much of how the Afghans have never given in to any invading force in their long history , and yet now they need Rambo to come in and save them from the Russians , but no matter . The movie was made to give the world another dose of outlandish Rambo-style retribution directed at the evil forces that be , and that's what it delivers . It's just too bad that Rambo-style retribution is generally so head-smackingly dumb .
543758	562732	910905	5.0	In The Valley of Elah Part 2 ?	Remember that movie In The Valley of Elah ? It was the movie that Tommy Lee Jones starred in before this one . Yeah , this is exactly the same movie . I've been a huge fan of Jones ever since he first came to my attention in Under Siege , but come on man , time to branch out a little bit , you know ? On the other hand , In The Valley of Elah , which is just as disappointing as In the Electric Mist ( but doesn't have nearly as bizarre a title ) , was released the same year that Jones appeared in No Country For Old Men , so I guess the man deserves some credit . But I'm still getting over The Missing and The Hunted . Yawn ! This time , Jones plays Dave Robicheaux , an alcoholic who is a regular at the bars , where he orders drinks that he never drinks . He's a detective in the deep south , and one day he spots an Italian sports car speeding through the sleepy streets of their town . When he pulls it over , he finds it's being driven by Elrod Sykes ( Peter Saarsgard ) , a local boy who has become a movie star but is now drag racing through his town drunk out of his mind . Dave sidesteps the expected bribes and goes to run him in like he should , but changes his mind when Sykes tells him he knows where a dead body is . Before you go thinking about Stand By Me , the most famous " I know where there's a dead body " movie ever made , this one goes in a completely different direction . The body is the result of a decades-old hate crime , where a bunch of racists had chained a black man and then shot him while he ran through the swamps for his life . Dave , a 17-year-old boy at the time , actually witnessed the crime from across the swamp but never figured out who the killers were . Now , the location of the body has been revealed and it has become his life's mission to bring the killers to justice . Complicating the movie more than necessary is a simultaneous investigation that Dave is running about the murder of a blonde prostitute and , worst of all , some truly bizarre run-ins with the Civil War generals out in the woods . There is suggestion that it is just a local group of dedicated fanatics in the middle of a Civil War re-enactment , but at times it seems more like an LSD flashback than anything else . Ultimately the movie is nothing but a tedious wait to see some racist dirtbags get what they deserve for a vicious hate crime that happened decades earlier . There is a brief approach of the difficult subject of forgiving someone for a past crime when they have made genuine change , although the change portrayed in the movie is not genuine so the idea is dropped pretty quick . There is always a feeling that the movie is about to take off but it just never does , and when the end credits start to roll there's a distinct feeling that you may have just wasted a bunch of time . I should mention that the movie is based on a book called " In the Electric Mist with Confederate Dead , " which I haven't read , and I understand that some fans of the book are pretty impressed with the film adaptation , so there may be something more to be said about the movie than I give it credit for here . But as an unprepared moviegoer , there definitely seems to be something missing here . None of the performances are disappointing and the location where the movie was shot is undeniably beautiful , but it just seemed to me that nothing materialized along the way ?
543994	562732	120184	5.0	A strangely disappointing adaptation of a Michael Crichton novel that comes off to a smashing good start but very quickly approaches a precipitous downhill .	Sphere is a science fiction film that starts off with a tremendously fascinating story and ignores all of the possibilities that it entails . Four people ( you know the drill ? a psychologist ( Dustin Hoffman ) , a mathematician ( Samuel L . Jackson ) , a biochemist ( Sharon Stone ) and an astrophysicist ( Liev Schreiber ) ) are flown out to the middle of the ocean on a top-secret missions ( even they don't know where they're going ) . We would be just as confused as they were about the details of their mission if we had never seen the previews , but even though we already know what they're going to find out there , it's just as interesting to learn about the details of this ship that has been found on the bottom of the ocean , and that appears to have been sitting there for 300 years ( well , okay , 288 ) . The story keeps getting better and better as we learn that there is a hum coming from the ship , indicating that there is still something running inside it , and then even more fascinating revelations once we are taken inside the ship . There can be no doubt that Sphere contains some truly interesting and entertaining elements , and that things like the acting are just as superb as we would expect from such a spectacular cast , but as the movie progresses , we begin to realize how little the film is going to reveal . I can't say that I wasn't completely enraptured for at the least the first hour of the film , but there were just as many bitterly disappointing things about it as there were good things . Dustin Hoffman and Samuel L . Jackson , in particular , delivered absolutely brilliant performances in this film , delivering some of the best entertainment in the entire film by themselves . There is a mildly interesting but completely unconvincing ex-romantic tension between Sharon Stone's character , Dr . Beth Halperin , and Dustin Hoffman's character , Dr . Norman Goodman , that is there for little other reason than to complicate the lives of the characters as they try to solve the mystery of this undersea ship . ( spoilers ) It's really too bad that the movie completely falls on its face in the second half , because the first half of the film is excellent and undeniably entertaining . There's nothing like a bit of time travel and the suggestion of extraterrestrial life to keep you entertained , and it is definitely a great scene when we find out that the ship is a human ship . This is one of the many things in the film that really makes you think . The thing that makes a great film is that it inspires thought . This is probably the one thing that all of the great films have in common with each other . There are surely a lot of things about Sphere that really make you think , which is another reason that the first half of the film is so good . We see that it's a human ship , which opens a whole new area of possibilities for the film . Harry ( Samuel L . Jackson ) speculates on the fact that the last entry in the ship's log is an entry into an ' Unknown entry event , ' indicating that they will never reach the surface to reveal what they've found . There is also a possibly over-extensive excursion into the realm of the psychological element in the film , as the characters are all made to face their fears , some of which are not just your average fears , such as Harry's strange fear of finishing 20 , 000 Leagues Under The Sea . The special effects are definitely nothing to brag about , but there are some interesting scenes that take place in the deep ocean , such as the death of Teeny Fletcher ( hey , she's black , she had it coming , right ? ) in the midst of a mass of strange sea creatures , as well as the scene with the thousands of squid eggs . Weird looking things , I've wondered since I saw the film what kind of props they used for that scene . The conversation with ' Jerry ' is unfittingly childish , but there is definitely a significant element of tension introduced when Jerry gets mad , as well as the scene where Norman contemplated the implications of Jerry's expression of emotions , indicating his ability to get mad . There are undeniably a lot of interesting things about Sphere , and it surely has the power to entertain , but it goes off the track later in the film , maybe because it tried to answer too many of its questions . There are some unanswerable things in the film , and the movie deals with them by having the characters have a weakly-written discussion about their fears and questions , and their ultimate decision to ' forget ' what they know using the power that they seem to have gained from the sphere . While this answers the question of how it could have been an unknown entry event when they all made it to the surface , it's probably the weakest ending that the film could possibly have had . As a strange twist on the science fiction genre , Sphere succeeds , although only in the first half . Like Hollow Man , Sphere could have and should have been a much better film . The unfortunate fact about the film is that it contains a lot of very interesting and very entertaining things that are surely worth watching , but the disappointing ending almost makes them not even worth seeing .
544234	562732	70633	6.0	The bad parts are pretty bad , but the good parts are creepy as hell .	This made for TV horror thriller is a lot better than it's ridiculous title would have you believe , which is really saying something since the title is actually a pretty apt description of what goes on in the movie . It starts out with a girl acting really strangely , running away something that isn't identified and then turning up dead . Her sister doesn't accept the police's quick decision to label it a suicide and close the case . Surely there is plenty of evidence to suggest that they are right , but then again , they don't take supernatural explanations into account so her sister Elizabeth decides to take the investigation into her own hands . Suspicious that the girl's school that her sister attended at the time of her death may have had something to do with what happened to her , Elizabeth enrolls into the school to do some investigating of her own . I don't know how fresh the idea of that premise was in 1973 , but it works pretty well here . There are some slip-ups , like when Elizabeth meets the Head Mistress for an interview and spouts some nonsense like " Picasso was a realist painter before he was an impressionist . " Not that I don't accept that someone her age would have any knowledge about that ( it is , after all , not exactly the kind of knowledge reserved for geniuses ) , it's just that it's so out of place in this movie . I guess I should respect such an attempt at three dimensional characterization though . Horror movies are , after all , historically lacking in this area . I got Satan's School for Girls on a 10-movie collection that I bought for $15 , since I have something of a love of old , crappy horror movies ( and you can't beat that price ! ) , otherwise I would never have seen it . To be sure , this is one of those movies that is actually worth watching but has a title that is incredibly efficient in making people want to see it . Who would want to watch a movie with a title like this ? I imagine that's part of the reason that the remake with Shannon Dougherty came and went instantaneously with little to no attention . And this really is unfortunate , because the movie certainly has some tense moments . The scene where Elizabeth goes searching the basement for the room where the painting of her sister took place is wonderfully creepy . Even that painting itself is a great prop . The psychology teacher in the movie is a little too obvious . I think it's safe to say that no character should ever act as evil or nutty as this guy did . When he's not threatening girls with a huge knife he's making rats go insane in his lab . This guy can NOT be well balanced . It actually is a pretty clever technique to have designed the cavernous basement like the rat maze in his classroom , but if the person acting insane turns out to be the bad guy then the movie is too predictable , and if they turn out to be completely innocent then it becomes too clear that the movie was trying to deliberately lead you in the wrong direction , which in turn requires a Scooby-Doo ending because they need to explain why we were wrong the whole time in thinking exactly what they wanted us to think . The movie takes something of a downturn in the third act , as the cheesy acting starts to tip the scales against the creepy atmosphere , which is no longer creepy enough to justify overlooking how bad the acting is . There is a ludicrous scene where the professor can't get out of a pond because there are girls all around him poking him with sticks . If they had established earlier on that he can't swim , fine , but any warm-blooded human being , man or woman , would have simply grabbed onto the first stick that poked him or her and yanked the girl holding it right into the pond . It would not be hard to do , obviously . But there I go nitpicking . I just have a hard time with scenes like that . It's like when someone takes a person hostage , holding a gun to their head while the whole police force stands with their guns aimed , and they all drop their guns like incompetent morons . In all my years of movie watching , only twice have I seen anybody acknowledge how effective it would be to just shoot the guy ( one was RoboCop , and the other was Charlie Sheen in Navy Seals ) . You wouldn't even have to kill him , Shooting the gunman in the arm would usually not endanger the victim at all and would completely incapacitate the gunman from being able to fire . There I go nitpicking AGAIN . Stop me next time , will you ? I don't remember there being any shooting in Satan's School for Girls ( although there is a gun ) , and there is little to no gore either , the movie is almost solely driven by its atmosphere , which most of the time is not very effective but a few times is VERY effective . For 70s horror , this is definitely one of the better ones ( excluding the giants , like The Exorcist , which are , of course , in a class all their own ) . Certainly worth seeing for horror buffs .
544018	562732	191397	6.0	Not original in the slightest sense of the word , but good acting and entertaining comedy make this weak story at least a little bit better .	The Replacements , as I am sure hundreds of people have noted already , is yet another football movie . There have been only a few football movies which were very well made and resulted in quality films ( Unnecessary Roughness was fairly well-done , and especially The Program , probably one of the best ) , but it seemed that The Replacements was an effort to either revive that genre ( which is pretty much worn out ) or to cash in on its past success . The story is loosely based on and an updated version of the 1987 pro-football strike ( I doubt that the bullet riddled Porsche was a 1987 model ) , but the majority of the film is made up of an unimaginative story about " replacement players . " Almost the entire movie was put together using scenes that were disturbingly familiar to scenes from other films . For example , the actual replacement players were introduced exactly the same way that the ' replacement astronauts ' were introduced in Armageddon . The actual football scenes require no imagination at all , and could have come from anywhere , and the cheerleaders were a tasteless element of the film in the tradition of BASEketball . Besides that , how about the ending ? ( spoilers ) The team needs " heart " in order to win the big game , coach McGinty ( Gene Hackman ) says to the television reporter . He is obviously sending out a message specifically to Shane Falco ( Keanu Reeves ) , the team's ' star ' replacement quarterback . How touching . Needless to say , Falco decides to head down to the stadium to save the day , and boot the pro quarterback who had recently re-joined the team . Falco walks into the locker room at half time , everyone cheers , they go on to win the game . Does that sound familiar at all ( " Remember when B-Bobby Boucher showed up and the M-M-Mud Dogs won the Bourbon Bowl , do ya ? " ) ? Yeah , so Falco saved the day in true Waterboy form , and the movie ends just like every other football film ever made has ended . Despite the lacking story and the many unlikely events that take place ( " Is that your ride ? " " Yeah . " BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM ! ! ! ) , The Replacements was barely saved by some surprisingly good acting . I was sick and tired of Keanu Reeves ( until I saw The Matrix , where he delivered an excellent performance ) , and I expected a disappointing turn from The Matrix to a routine football film , but he was very convincing as the disillusioned quarterback who is suddenly faced with the chance to reverse his shabby reputation . Even Brooke Langton provides a good depiction of the only original cheerleader who is suddenly surrounded by strip club airheads and has some pretty good on-screen chemistry with the monotonous Keanu . The Replacements is a fairly good football film which doesn't really do anything that hasn't been done before , but at least it wasn't as terrible as Varsity Blues . It is worth watching to see the underdogs beat the odds and come out on top ( yet again ) , but don't expect any plot twists . If you've ever seen a sports movie , you know the basic structure that they follow , and you'll know what's going to happen from the very beginning .
543777	562732	120620	6.0	Excellent performances saved this one from total failure .	( spoilers ) Brokedown Palace is a very effective and highly emotional film . It succeeds on many levels , but it also fails on many levels . While the film is totally unoriginal ( HEAVY emphasis on ' unoriginal ' ) , it is very well acted and directed , even if nearly every aspect of the story itself has very recently been seen in almost exactly the same way . Brokedown Palace is literally a remake of the stunningly powerful film Return To Paradise , which starred Vince Vaughn and Joaquin Pheonix , and which presented almost exactly the same story , except that the main characters were male and there were three of them instead of two . Alice and Darlene ( Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale , respectively ) take a trip to Thailand together just after high school , to celebrate their lifelong friendship that is about to be separated by college . Once there , they almost immediately encounter a charming Australian guy who wines and dines both of them , sparking intense jealousy , and coerces them to accompany him to Hong Kong . While it's not hard to believe that , in their rush to get to the airport on time , Alice did not notice the extra weight of the narcotics that Nick ( the charming Australian guy ) planted in her pack , it was kind of a big risk that he took , assuming that they would be too rushed to notice that much extra weight in their luggage . One of the main problems with the film is that Alice and Darlene were so reckless when they first got to Thailand . Sure , this establishes the fact that they just didn't know better , hence increasing the emotion caused by their later misfortune , but some of it was just too much . Like when they were at the royal hotel and ordered all kinds of drinks on some random room's tab , and Alice says , ' Oh , they don't care . ' Naiveté is one thing , but that is absolute stupidity . Never mind the fact that they are in a foreign and significantly more dangerous country - pulling some moronic stunt like that will get you in big trouble ANYwhere . Another unnecessary element was the ordeal with Darlene's father later in the film . He shows up at the prison in Thailand and soothingly convinces Darlene that everything is going to be okay , that he'll make sure everything is fixed and she gets home safely and out of that damn prison . Then when Alice comes out , he basically tells her that he never trusted her and she can rot in that prison thousands of miles away from anything she knows , for all he cares . Why is it that this guy goes immediately from being a loving and caring father to an absolute worthless bastard ? I don't care how many times she got paint on his couch or got his daughter in trouble or whatever , that is no reason to leave her in a strange prison on the other side of the planet . That guy was a total dick , and nothing ever really even came of that scene . The legal ordeal that the girls went through involving the seedy lawyer played by Bill Pullman was also very interesting , but also grossly unoriginal . Alice and Darlene suffer the exact same troubles that faced the characters in Return To Paradise , with exactly the same result . While this was an entertaining and admittedly an intensely emotional film , without the quality performances Brokedown Palace would be little more than an instructional video about what not to do when on vacation in Thailand . The ending leaves you wondering if she ever really does get out of that prison , but we'll never know , because who the hell would want to watch a sequel to a film like this ? The film left so many loose ends that it almost cancelled out all of the things that it achieved . We know that Darlene goes home , and obviously she'll try to get Alice out , but they sure didn't have much luck up to that point . We only get a vague idea of what happens to Nick , and the film ends with Alice still in the prison , saying that she knows she did the right thing and that she remains hopeful that Darlene will fight for her until she gets released , too . Optimists are sure to get a good thrill out of this , but every single event in the entire film after they get thrown into prison suggests that Alice is never going to get out of there , at least not until she's an old woman . This weak ending ( although still very emotional , due to the quality acting from Claire ) takes a lot away from a film that was not that good to begin with . I suggest that you watch Return To Paradise instead - it's more original and MUCH better .
544252	562732	23694	6.0	Classy old thriller .	It's amazing how times have changed . When considering the change from the plodding zombies in The Dawn of the Dead into the turbo-charged , sprinting zombies in the 2004 remake , I suppose it can be expected that a zombie film made in the early 1930s might feature some zombies that stand stark still for extended periods of time . Enter the legendary Bela Lugosi , starring as the highly creepy " Murder " Legendre , who controls the zombies by interlocking his hands and opening his eyes really wide . There is a contrived love story threaded through the narrative that serves to confuse why Rob Zombie chose this film to name his band after , although for such an early film it is highly accomplished . The atmosphere is creepy , especially during the scene early in the film that shows Legendre's zombie's at work ( which contains a sound effect that had to have influenced that cringe-inducing croaking sound in The Grudge ) . The performances are often cartoonish and overdone , and an almost intolerably slow pace makes it less thrilling than it could have been , but that and a persistently eerie atmosphere adds to the effect .
544534	562732	239395	6.0	Disappointing .	The thing that really makes a good family film is when it appeals to both children and adults . For example , you have Toy Story , Toy Story 2 , Shrek , The Iron Giant , and even , surprisingly enough , lots and lots of Disney films . Unfortunately , the whole thing about technologically advanced domesticated animals who are also experts at tactical warfare is just too silly to be entertaining . It was fun to a degree , but when you see cats parachuting with night vision goggles or that damn underground subway system that the dogs somehow built , it goes too far . In one of Gallagher's stand-up comedy videos ( Stuck In The 60s , I believe ) , he is making fun of those rugs that show a picture of dogs shooting pool or cats playing poker , and he quips , ' You can't get a cat to sht in a box , you don't want him to ante in at your table . ' I wish I could see his reaction to the behavior of the cats and dogs in this movie ! I'm sure that Cats & Dogs is a fun movie for a much younger audience , but the scope of the film is so narrow that it can only really be enjoyed by kids . The movie was obviously not made by cat people , by the way , because of the fact that the cats are obviously the evil antagonists in the film , so if you have and love a cat or two in your household , it may be a good idea not to rent this one for your kids . There is some amusing dialogue and an interesting subplot involving Jeff Goldblum's attempt to come up with a serum to eliminate allergic reactions to dogs , but as a whole , Cats & Dogs just about falls flat .
543826	562732	199753	6.0	The movie falls apart right about the same time that the ship does .	The problem with Red Planet is that there is too much known about it before it begins , and this is not only because of previews , but also because of common sense . About halfway through the film , for example , there is a lengthy scene of completely false tension , where the three survivors are helplessly watching their oxygen timers count slowly down to zero , knowing that they have nowhere to go and nothing to do but wait to suffocate . Obviously , we know throughout this entire scene that all they have to do is take off their helmets and start breathing , because if they die like that the movie's over . I suppose some tension might be derived from the fact that THEY don't know they can breathe the air on Mars yet , but since we're a thinking audience , a scene like this falls flat because we already know they're going to survive . I liked some of the things in the movie . It was pretty interesting when they finally arrived at the base on Mars and found that it had been completely destroyed , and the conflict was introduced very early as the ship begins to break apart as soon as they arrive into Mars ' atmosphere , forcing the team to split up for the rest of the movie , but then you realize that every bit of power failed on the ship and yet they still have gravity . Earth has become so polluted that humankind needs a new home , and nations around the world have combined their knowledge and money and space travel capabilities to launch this completely English speaking crew into space to test out the possibility of humans someday living on Mars . Algae has been launched there over a period of twenty years to try to build up an atmosphere of oxygen , but all the algae seems to have disappeared , and one of the mission's objectives is to find out why . I like that they came up with an interesting reason for the algae having disappeared , but I don't like the fact that the screenplay pretends that there can be breathable oxygen on Mars , while an entire Earthful of humans are sending up a manned spacecraft into the atmosphere and don't realize it . Missions like this are not cheap . No spacecraft , manned or not , is sent to another planet without extremely detailed knowledge of that planet's atmosphere . ( spoilers ) That was a hell of an oversight , but I liked that the movie didn't just have them meet some hugely disappointing Martians for our heroes to escape , but the villain that IS presented , while creative in a sense , is even worse . The mission included an exploration robot named AMEE , which for some reason comes with a ' Military Mode . ' I guess this is done in case they should run into any Martian terrorists during the mission . And since AMEE comes equipped with detailed knowledge of the weaknesses of human anatomy , it seems that her designers were concerned about HUMAN Martian terrorists . Not a lot of thought put into this aspect of the movie . Obviously , not a SINGLE person on the crew sent to Mars read the sticker on the back of AMEE , which clearly read , ' WARNING : SEVERE SHOCK OR JARRING OF THIS ROBOT WILL IMMEDIATELY TURN HER INTO A TERMINATRIX . ' On top of that , Red Planet contains probably the biggest loose end that I've seen left loose in a movie since Planet of the Oops in 2001 . Evidently some multi-cellular organisms have evolved on the surface of Mars ( feeding on massive fields of algae , yet another thing that the stupid humans on earth didn't notice ) , that eat just about anything digestible that they come into contact with . Two crew members are lost to them , but not before two of them ( note , the number required for breeding ) can be captured in a steel capsule to be taken back to earth and studied . Just before one crew member succumbs to the little critters , he tosses the capsule to the one member surviving ( Gallagher , played by Val Kilmer ) , insisting that he bring it back to earth with him . At this point , it's perfectly natural to expect that they would have one more uprising just before the end of the movie , or that they would stow away on the ship and create havoc on Earth , like that spider did in Arachnophobia , traveling back to America in that coffin . Instead , Gallagher takes the capsule and the creatures are gone from the story completely as though they were never even there . When the crew took off their helmets and found a breathable atmosphere that no one ever knew about until then , I thought THAT was an oversight , but this , THIS violates even the most basic rules of story writing . One of the first things that you learn about writing stories is that every scene must have a reason for being in the story . If it doesn't , take it out . The fact that the creatures play no role in the outcome of the movie renders their existence in the movie meaningless beyond just having some fancy special effects showing some creative Martian creature . There is so much that could have been done with those animals , which is why it was so disappointing to see them just disappear like that . Things like that are only excusable in movies that promise sequels , or movies that show the creatures remaining as a way to signify an amusing false sense of security , like in Little Shop of Horrors . I just don't really foresee much chance of a sequel to Red Planet . As a science fiction film , Red Planet is entertaining and fun , but there are oversights like the ones I've mentioned that just show that not much thought was put into the screenplay , and something like that alone can completely ruin an otherwise decent movie . The performances all around are more than satisfactory , there is a lot of focus on characterization and the interaction of the crew members and the problems that can arise from questions of trust and questions of faith in machinery that has never been properly tested before the mission ( since it was never sent into space until the mission ) , but there's nothing worse than being impressed by some parts of a movie and slapping your forehead about other parts . The movie provides a great Martian landscape , it contains a thrilling landing scene , in which the pod carrying all of the crew members sprouts huge air bags on all sides to provide for a relatively soft landing , only to roll right off a cliff , and there is even a question of God and religion to add to the complexity of the plot , but there are unfortunate shortcomings that really slow the movie down and prevent it from being as good as it should have been . The talent was there during the production , it just seems like both the script and the final film needed to spend a little more time in the editing room .
544785	562732	184858	6.0	Reindeer Games attempts to run with the likes of such classics as Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction , but unfortunately it falls significantly short .	Reindeer Games is a good thriller . It is fun to watch , it has a good story , it's entertaining , and even most of the acting is respectable enough . However , as a whole , the film is pretty weak . Ben Affleck is a car thief who is serving a six year sentence in prison . His cell-mate is a man named Nick Cassidy ( James Frain ) , who seems to have met a beautiful woman named Ashley ( Charlize Therun ) in some sort of prison pen pal system . Rudy and Nick are scheduled to be released on the same day , but Nick has a run-in with a convict and winds up getting killed . Upon his release , Rudy has the bright idea to pose as Nick Cassidy so that he can get , uh , better acquainted with this Ashley girl that he has been hearing about for so long . Unfortunately , her truck driver / amatuer criminal older brother has found out from his letters to her that he previously worked in a casino , and he and his gang want Nick's help ( whether he's willing to help or not ) to rob that casino . Unable to prove that he's not Nick Cassidy and unaware of the design of the inside of the casino , Rudy is then faced with the challenge of successfully robbing this place so that the gang doesn't kill him , while at the same time avoiding getting caught so that he doesn't go back to jail for the rest of his life . The story is good . The huge holes ( why would someone as beautiful as Ashley turn to a prison pen pal system to look for dates ? ! ) are covered up pretty well by the time the film ends , and luckily the acting , for the most part , makes up for the crudeness of the script . The plot is derived from Quentin Tarantino's trademark of showing the end of the story at the beginning of the film . This is always an interesting thing to see , especially in a film like this . However , probably the most disturbing thing about Reindeer Games is the extensive and inexplicable use of blue screens and deep focus photography . There were a lot of shots that showed a face or a gun or something close to the camera , and everything else in the shot , everything that is far away from the camera , is also in focus . There is nothing inherently wrong with this , but it is unnatural , and it calls attention to the fact that there is a movie camera right there . Filmmaking is one of the few professions where invisibility is a goal for success , and while this deliberate violation of that rule is not necessarily prohibited , it should only be committed with good reason . There were scenes in Reindeer Games where I couldn't figure out why deep focus photography and especially blue screens were needed . Despite all of that , however , it did give the film a very distinctive look . Despite the film's numerous shortcomings , Reindeer Games is a fairly well-made crime thriller . I've seen Gary Sinise look better in other films ( see every other film he's ever been in except Mission to Mars ) , and Charlize is not entirely convincing at times , although she did deliver a satisfactory performance , all told . And most of all , if you like plot twists , check this one out , because there are plenty .
544617	562732	274166	6.0	" The word ' mistakes , ' sir , is one that does not appear in my dictionary ? "	Our first look at Johnny English is as an ultra-smooth secret agent , which turns out to be a dream sequence as we meet the real English , a bumbling desk jockey who fantasizes about a life of danger . The movie turns in a completely different direction when we realize that this is a dream sequence , and I have to say that it is not a disappointing turn at all . Far from being a wild turn from Atkinson's most successful character , Johnny English is basically Mr . Bean playing James Bond , and in true Bean style . This is an excellent premise that allows for plenty of mishaps and mayhem , but unfortunately it also takes away some of the movie's intended effect , because we know that just about everything English does will be wrong . Because of that , a lot of the biggest screw-ups are immediately obvious and then become tiresome as they play out , such as English sky-diving onto the wrong building and holding a lot of doctors and nurses hostage , holding up the wrong funeral and dancing on the coffin of a grieving family , and attempting to pull off the plastic face of the wrong Arch Bishop in front of an astonished crowd . Nevertheless , the movie very successfully emulates the look and feel of a Bond film , even more than the far superior Austin Powers did ( or either of the hugely disappointing sequels ) , and there are some genuine laughs . John Malkovich , as well , is surprisingly convincing as the French villain , illustrating once again the British distaste for French people , a widespread feeling that I don't really understand , but have seen evidence of it in several movies and TV shows ( Atkinson also lampoons them in the TV show The Thin Blue Line ) . Malkovich takes on a fake French accent , but for some reason it is not distracting . Maybe it's because of the movie he's in , which doesn't expect any part of it to be taken seriously . The premise is also overblown in the traditional Bond way . Pascal Sauvage ( Malkovich ) plans to steal the crown jewels , force the Queen to renounce her authority , get himself crowned king , and turn all of England into the world's biggest prison . You see , he has become a billionaire as the owner of something like 500 prisons in 60 countries , so why not close them all down and just own one country that is just one big prison ? Upon learning about the villain's goal , I wondered how the movie was received in England . During his speech where he describes his plan to his cronies , Sauvage his goal for the future of England as something like " 210 , 000 square miles of prime real estate conveniently separated from true civilization by 20 miles of ocean , and soon available for the entire world to dump their human waste into . " True civilization ? Human waste ? Those are some pretty strong words , even for such a goofy movie ! Nevertheless , the movie in undeniably fun , although it does have the feeling that it is made up of not quite enough good material stretched over a running time that's too long , even at a modest 80 minutes or so . Natalie Imbruglia shows up in a throwaway role as the Bond girl . She is beautiful and fills the role well but isn't really given much to do but show up occasionally and recite her sparse lines . There are some brief sex jokes that might make it not the best thing to show to the youngest viewers , although they are the ones that would probably appreciate most of the humor . All in all not a bad film , it's vintage Bean material that even with his astonishing incompetence he could manage to go from being a fifth-rate secret agent to quite literally being crowned the King of England ( entirely by accident , no less ) , but Rowan has done much better .
544774	562732	106315	6.0	What's all this about Top Gun on the ski slopes and Endless Summer of skiing ?	If there's one thing I can say about Aspen Extreme , it is that it is not at all the Top Gun of the ski slopes , it's The Great Outdoors of the ski slopes . And by that , of course , I mean it's The Great Outdoors without John Candy or Dan Aykroyd . And by THAT , of course , I mean it's The Great Outdoors , but not funny . Oddly enough , the movie is more a combination of The Great Outdoors and Dumb & Dumber than anything else , but all of the comedy has been removed . In fact , the only thing that the movie takes from Top Gun is the cloying cheesiness and relentless predictability . Not that I didn't enjoy it . My roommate recommended the movie to me , lending it to me out of his DVD collection so I thought I'd check it out . I wasn't entirely disappointed in the movie because it featured some spectacular skiing scenery , but I enjoyed it for how bad it was just as much as I enjoyed the acting , story , etc . The story is about two guys living in Detroit and both working dead end jobs , when one of them gets a promotion to another dead end job and decides to just pick up and get out of town . I respect that , there's hardly a better way to make your life interesting when it's become too routine than to completely mix it up in a way that you don't know what it will all lead to . Just pick up and leave , when you think about it , there's no way you're going to become homeless ( although you might spend a few nights in your van ? ) . They start out not knowing anyone in town and end up with one of them sleeping with the richest woman in town ( that's Lloyd in bed with Mary Swanson ) AND the most frigid , uptight woman in town ( remember that cheesy teenage romance in The Great Outdoors ? Yeah . That . ) , while the other ends up getting involved with moving massive amounts of drugs to make a little extra money . By the way , if ever there walked the earth a man who could not keep his cool , he is in this movie . Dexter's paralyzing quickness to freak out is nearly a character in itself . T . J . , the more successful of the two , has vague aspirations to become a writer that come up when the screenplay needs them to , and is torn between sleeping with a good-looking wealthy ( and oddly motherly ) woman and sleeping with a more regular girl with a job as a radio host who cares more about him but is frigid , grumpy and completely uninteresting because of her total lack of personality beyond her aloofness . The film is best when it shows breathtaking shots of extreme skiing , but even then tends to trip up when it tries to tie un-matching shots together as it does numerous times in showing skiers going down the hill . There are times when it is amazing that they thought two shots could go together , but I'm willing to accept that for the sake of the story , which unfortunately is not very good . You have the love interest , the conflict to the love interest , the best friend in need , the over-the-top villain ( and they do NOT let you forget that this guy is VERY bad ) , etc . Overall not a bad movie , but comparisons to other classics like Endless Summer and Top Gun may run the risk of giving false expectations . This is direct to video fare , but in that genre you could certainly do worse . It's much better than Ski School , for example ?
544145	562732	4282	7.0	Charlie the ineffective husband .	In one of the most effective and thorough characterizations in any of Chaplin's films up until that time , in Mabel's Married Life Charlie plays Mabel's husband , an feeble drunk incapable of deflecting the oafish advances of a huge man in the park , who hits on Charlie's wife right in front of him . Starting these films in the park was one of Chaplin's favorite things to do back in the earliest days of his career , but here he starts his film there and then takes us into the mind of one of the characters , rather than just having some on screen slapstick goofiness . Soon after the park incident , Charlie goes to a bar and is teased by the other patrons as he slowly gets drunk . His wife , meanwhile , is at home fashioning a blow-up doll to resemble the man in the park , thus providing a scenario from which her drunken husband can emerge her hero . There have been some criticisms that the scene involving the dummy wasn't fleshed out and made into the effective scene that it could have been , but I have to disagree . It is very stereotypical Chaplin comedy that comes out of the scene , but I can't think of any reason to expect anything different . What we do get is a brief but effective look at the desperation of a woman who is married to someone who wants to but is unable to protect her from undesirables , and her efforts to improve her husband's confidence . It doesn't seem to work too well , but I have a feeling that the film's original audiences were more than pleased . This film , by the way , is notable as being the first that Chaplin was allowed to write and direct on his own , and as compared to the rest of his films from this time , it is clear that he immediately began to prove his talent . Oh , and one more thing - you may notice that the film has French intertitles . I'm not sure why this is , but those of you lucky ( and smart ) enough to own a Mac , you can just type them into the translator on your Dashboard and have it translated into your language of choice . . .
543902	562732	66434	7.0	George Lucas ' first film foreshadows , in many ways , the work that he would later do in the tremendously successful Star War films .	THX-1138 is the name of the character played by Robert Duvall who , in the film , lives in a futuristic world in which people are deprived of virtually every possible element of individuality , especially their emotions . They are created by the masses , for the masses , which , to me , means that they are created and controlled for the good of the " society " as a whole . THX-1138 is the person in this society ( played by Robert Duvall ) who senses that something is wrong , and begins talk of trying to escape . He feels that his relationship with the girl to whom he has been assigned as a mate is not normal , which gets him into all kinds of trouble with the guards . These guards , by the way , are one of the several things that can be seen to foreshadow Lucas ' work in Star Wars . The guards in THX-1138 are like very early models of the droids that predominate in the Star Wars films , despite the fact that for the most part , they have fairly normal human voices . Donald Pleasance plays the part of another nameless character , and he spends a lot of time talking about ways to unite together in order to escape . In one scene , several men are so preoccupied with talking about ways to escape that they don't seem to notice as one man tries to rape a woman ( THX's mate , as a matter of fact ) nearby . The actual escape attempt is composed of a series of confusing events that eventually lead to the film's unique ending . There is one scene that takes place in some sort of seemingly endless whiteness . George Lucas has proven that he has a tremendous visual imagination , which is confusing when we see this part of the film filled with so much nothing . We can only be left to assume by now that they just didn't have enough money to do some of the many things Lucas probably had in mind , something which he clearly does not have to worry about anymore . This strange scene is flawed , actually , in a couple of ways . First of all , although this may just be an example of Lucas ' quirkiness , the 180-degree-rule of filming is violated several times in this desert scene , giving the feeling that they change directions in between cuts . In one shot , the characters are walking to the right , then there's a cut to the other side of them and they seem to be walking back the way they just came . On the other hand , this could have been done with the purpose of implying the endlessness of this place . Luckily , they are approached by a black man who professes to know the way out of the place . This , however , is a flaw , because at one point this man claims to be a hologram , yet a few minutes earlier he had eaten some of their food . I think that one of the best parts of the entire film is the chase near the end , with THX in the racecar and the guards on the futuristic-looking motorcycles that would still be impressive today , in my opinion . The sheer speed of this part of the chase is particularly effective , and can also be seen in numerous places in the Star Wars films , including the great pod-racing scene of Episode One . ( spoilers ) As the chase nears the end , there are seemingly endless vertical tunnels are another thing that really resemble some things seen in the Star Wars films , and THX's triumphant escape is made fairly dramatic by the stunning sunset . Even though it seems that he has escaped to a world of nothingness , he has also escaped FROM a world of nothingness , and he has succeeded in achieving his goal . I think that the ending may have been a little too ambiguous , or sudden at least , but it succeeds in that it shows a nameless character escaping a world of oppression and achieving freedom .
544281	562732	120616	7.0	Actual quote - " Rescue the damsel in distress , kill the bad guy , save the world . "	This version of The Mummy ( one of the several titles within film lore that seems to have been made and remade for decades ) is pretty much exactly what you would expect from a modern adaptation of an old horror classic , especially given the types of films that are released these days . The action and special effects of the 1932 classic have been massively increased , and the new film turns more to shocking special effects , often cheesy comic relief , and sparkling scenery , away from the slow , creeping tension of the original . As a result , we get a fast moving feature that places a lot of emphasis on its special effects and it's good-looking stars . Thankfully , the movie knows when to laugh at itself , but it trips because it doesn't know when to stop . The film starts roughly 3000 years in the past , with the Egyptian priest Imhotep being put to a rather vicious death for getting a little too friendly with the Pharaoh's mistress . Naturally , he is mummified alive , sealed in a coffin with a lot of flesh-eating beetles ( the sounds of which make up some of the creepiest stuff in the whole movie ) , only to be accidentally resurrected by a lot of bounty hunters a few millennia later . This is where the cast comes in , Rick ( Brendan Fraser ) , Evelyn ( Rachel Weisz ) , and her brother Jonathan ( John Hannah ) . Rick is the hero of the movie , the guy who has been there and done it all and just wants to get his money and get out . He's kind of like a cross between the single-mindedness of Han Solo , the bad one-liners of James Bond , and the adventure experience of Indiana Jones , except that he comes across more as a muddy conglomeration of characters like those rather than an original character of his own . He goes through his part upset by the fact that other people seem to be constantly be holding him back from some faraway goal , the importance of which they can probably never be expected to understand . Evelyn is there mainly with scientific interest ( until she meets the hottie hero and romance is added to her To Do list ) and her brother Jonathan is there for pure financial gain , as is the movie's director and crew and production team . There is also a tagalong character named Beni who I can only satisfactorily describe as a greedy rat , someone you would expect to meet on the wet streets of New York in the 1940s or something . He is a constant double-crosser who never has anyone's but his own best interest in mind , and so naturally ends up working for the resurrected Imhotep . His weird eye-makeup and pathetically whiny little voice make him a perfect candidate for the throwaway antagonist , who Rick tries vainly to save in a climactic scene near the end of the film . The interesting thing about the plot comes up when you consider when exactly Imhotep became the bad guy . Really , all he did was fall in love with the wrong girl , and then when he was brought back to life , obviously he wanted to bring her back , too . One of the first things that I learned in film studies is that the audience should know as soon as possible whether they are meant to like or dislike a character , because first impressions are difficult to overcome . With that in mind then , when exactly was it that he went from the poor love-struck protagonist from the first act of the film to the monstrous antagonist during the rest of the movie ? My best theory is that first and foremost , he's killing people to bring himself and his love back to life . Granted , more killing would not justify the death of himself or of his loved one , Anck Su Namun , but considering the fact that all he did was fall in love and also considering the way that he was put to death , his reaction upon achieving life once more becomes a little more understandable . Second , what exactly does a resurrected protagonist look like ? I must admit that there is something a little too daunting about trying to come up with a likable mummy , but Imhotep is certainly a man who has seen more than his share of suffering . The special effects are hugely impressive despite the fact that they are obviously special effects ( the art of invisibility was not achieved very well here ) . When Imhotep is slowly regenerating , there are scenes showing his body and face that are impressive in their spectacle , but not impressive in not looking animated . As a whole , The Mummy is exactly what you might expect it to be , except that it was released amidst so much excitement and hype that it really should have taken itself more seriously and been more of a thinking film . It would have , under those circumstances , been immensely more respectable and might have joined its predecessor as a movie classic . It is a successful update of the Mummy theme ( which has become almost a genre in itself ) , but there is a lot of fluff in the film that simply doesn't belong .
544027	562732	190934	7.0	Not much for unexpectedness , but entertaining enough ?	I live in the middle of China so I don't get to see shows like this very often except when I'm back in the states visiting family , like now , but I've had a soft spot for these amazing videos shows ever since I first noticed how captivating live coverage of police chases in my native Los Angeles was , and then discovered COPS . I haven't seen more than maybe a dozen episodes of this show , but I've seen enough to know that the videos are often groan-inducing or genuinely frightening and are almost always ruined by the goofy narration . Like John Walsh's goofball , wildly over-dramatic narration of America's Most Wanted , the videos , even the really amazing ones , are almost always accompanied by laughable descriptions , which leave me with the feeling that if you took away phrases like bone crunching , or battered bodies , or narrowly escaped , or lucky to be alive , or watery grave , well , they just wouldn't have anything at all to say and wouldn't that just make for a completely different show . But either way , you can hardly do better for a lazy Sunday afternoon . If the show seems repetitive , you watch it too much . Otherwise , enjoy !
544824	562732	330181	7.0	One of America's most notorious serial killers used to be just the guy next door . Who knew of the horrors that were hidden within his crawl space ?	Hey , how about all those neighbors that were always wondering what that awful smell was that was coming from under his house ? Gacy as the unenviable distinction of being one of the few serial killers to rival the depravity of fellow psychopath Ed Gein , whose antisocial antics led to the inspiration of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre , The Silence of the Lambs , and Psycho . Gacy was less into wearing other people's skin as he was into strangling and sodomizing young men , providing plenty of material for a sick biography like this , which of course lots of sick people like me will go out and rent . Why we all get such a kick out watching things like this ( by " we all , " of course , I am referring to all of us sick people who get such a kick out of watching things like this ) I am not sure I rightly know , but I think Gacy is a well made film , given its subject matter and it's limited production capabilities . Sure , there are numerous holes , none of the acting is very impressive other than Mark Holton's ( who played Gacy himself ) , and the movie commits that cardinal sin of the movies , it throws logic out the window . The whole premise of the movie , as was the case in Gacy's life , is that John Wayne Gacy was a regular guy next door that no one would ever have suspected , but in the movie the quickness with which everyone dismisses the smell of rotting meat coming from under his house is a little trying . I don't know enough about the details of Gacy's life to know is people actually did smell decay from under his house and ignore , but I can't help but think that even if that did happen , it was dramatized for effect , as they say , in the movie . The thing that is most disturbing about a movie like this is that if someone had written a screenplay like this that was entirely fictional , they would probably have gotten a similar response that Wes Craven got when Last House on the Left was released . People didn't want him to be allowed to work in film again , and yet when it is based on true events people have this morbid fascination with it . Not that that's anything new , it just seems odd to me that people are more offended by fictional violence than true violence . I like that the movie has a lot of restraint when it comes to showing the things that Gacy actually did to his victims . We are not entirely spared a look at how he killed some of his victims ( this would have offended some of Gacy's fans , if you can believe that such a man has them ) , but the movie leaves most of the more heinous acts offscreen , concentrating more on things like thousands of crawling maggots and the inevitable smell emitted from the rotting corpses under his house . Most estimate that Gacy killed something like 30 young men , others say we may never know how many he killed . Holton does a great job with the script , which is not the best , and is especially good at making us believe that Gacy was able to be charming despite how frightening he could be when he was visiting the other half of his personality . It is indeed unsettling to think that a man who dressed up like a clown to entertain sick kids at a hospital could be killing large numbers of young men and doing things much more horrible than sodomy to them , but if you want to get a few insights into how and why he did it , this film is not a bad place to start . Note : I've read that , while this movie concentrates on the story from Gacy's point of view , there is also a television movie called To Catch A Killer that focuses more on the police investigation side of the story .
543969	562732	150377	7.0	Thanks God for Tommy Lee Jones .	Double Jeopardy is an interesting enough thriller , but it just isn't as satisfying as you would expect a movie with this premise to be . Ashley Judd is just annoying for the first hour or so of the film , and it isn't until the fugitive style chase begins that the movie gets really interesting . And this , of course , is where Tommy Lee's excellent acting is the most entertaining and fun . He has unfortunately been somewhat typecast since his spectacular performance in The Fugitive , but at least he has been typecast in a role that is always fun to watch and that he can always pull off excellently . I think it's pointless to try to argue whether or not the whole double jeopardy law can truly be handled in the way that it was described in the film , but as a crime film Double Jeopardy was pretty good . Judd's husband in the film is one of those characters that's easy to hate , and not only because of what he did in the movie . You just look at this guy and you immediately don't like him . That's good casting , but it also completely voided any effectiveness that his ' auction ' might ever have had . And how about that coffin scene ! Who cares that no one gets buried in a coffin that has plenty of room for two ! That was one of the creepiest things I've seen in a movie in years . Clearly , there is nothing spectacular about Double Jeopardy . It's not going to win any awards and it probably won't be remembered for very long . But it has a certain charm that can unfortunately only be appreciated if you're in the right state of mind when you watch it . Don't expect it to be as good as The Fugitive just because Tommy Lee Jones is in it ( really , are any movies as good as The Fugitive ? ) . I mean , let's face it , Double Jeopardy isn't even as good as Under Siege , but as far as a moderately entertaining crime thriller to kill a couple hours , you could definitely do a lot worse .
544160	562732	111742	7.0	Wasn't the werewolf theme used up by the early 80's at the latest ? Apparently not .	I didn't expect much from this film . Actually , the only reason that I watched it was because I am a huge Jack Nicholson fan , and I was surprised at how well-done the movie was . Jack Nicholson plays an editor named William Randall who kind of lets people walk all over him , and when he gets bitten by a wolf on a lonely road one night , he becomes an entirely different person . You might even say that the " Jack Nicholson " in Will Randall was brought out by the wolf . Michelle Pfeiffer was also very impressive as Laura , Will's reluctant lover and , eventually , fiancee . The werewolf makeup was particularly impressive , and even the stunts and special effects were worked out very well . However , I think that this was probably one of the last films in which colored contact lenses could have been used to draw anything other than a bored response . Ironically enough , however , they are also the reason that this film seems to be very dated when watching it only 6 years after it was made . Colored contacts are so old and cliched by now , mainly because any fool can get them , that they are just not effective in the movies anymore . Despite that , I have to say that I recommend Wolf , it was a very well-made and entertaining movie , and the story is excellent . It is one of those rare films that really has no slow points . It is not necessarily non-stop action , but your attention is held firmly throughout the movie .
544201	562732	758746	7.0	Jason Voorhees Still Mad About His Mom - ' Friday the 13th ' Review . . .	There comes a time in every overly long horror movie franchise when it's no longer necessary to add numbers at the end of the titles of the horizonless stream of sequels . This happened in the Friday the 13th series for the first time in part 4 , The Final Chapter , which incidentally is also the first time they put a bald-faced lie right into the title . Then the numbering system disappeared until part VI ( one of the only sequels worth watching ) , VII , and VIII , after which the whole titling process changed completely . In fact , no Friday the 13th movie has had " Friday the 13th " anywhere in the title since the stupendously bad Jason Takes Manhattan , which was released a full two decades ago . Now , the newest entry in the series is released with exactly the same title as the original ! I don't really want to contemplate what this means as far as the end of the series , if it will ever come . I tend to doubt it . Thankfully , the movie was a lot better than I expected . It would be something of an understatement to say that I had low expectations to begin with , but in the cinematic world of horror sequels , the new Friday the 13th is one of the better ones . The movie opens with a scene that shows little promise for a good horror movie . Anyone who has ever seen pretty much any Friday the 13th sequel will be immediately dismayed to see that they have elected to start this one off with the same thing - a bunch of idiot college kids wandering into the forest to get high and get laid , laughing and joking over a campfire about the legend of Jason Voorhees . " It all happened right here in these woods ! Right here where we are ! Jason could be right behind those trees ! Huh huh huh huh ! ! ! " Morons . This is , however , all part of a set-up that sets the stage for the rest of the movie , which thankfully takes a slightly different tact from the myriad of sequels that came before it . There's an opening sequence that's more than 20 minutes long that takes place before the opening title card , and then during the rest of the movie there's a college-age kid surveying all the people in the surrounding area of Camp Crystal Lake to find out if anyone has seen his missing sister , who was one of the kids in the beginning of the movie . Okay , maybe I lied . That's the only thing that's different . There is an unmistakable feeling that the only thing that ever changes in Friday the 13th movies is the kind of cars the kids drive and their accommodations . This time they're cruising along in an Escalade and staying in the vacation home of one of their parents . Evidently someone thought to buy a beautiful lakeside cabin at Crystal Lake , which until now never really struck me as a big vacation destination . The performances are uniformly bad throughout . They are exactly the same sophomoric idiots that star in every horror movie ever made that has high school or college kids in it . They show up making the same stupid jokes , wearing the same stupid halter tops and each representing the same stupid caricatures . The geek , the black kid , the jock ( s ) , the nervous good girl , the hot chick ( s ) , etc . But at least the paper thin characters make the admittedly clever and gruesome kills that much more satisfying . Kind of makes me wonder what a slasher film would be like if there was a single character in it that we cared about , you know ? Friday the 13th follows exactly the same formula that the series has followed who knows how many times before - a group of kids go into the woods together and manage to get separated from each other within usually less than ten minutes - but as Jason gets on in age ( by my calculations he should be somewhere in his early 60s by now ) he has gotten bigger and faster and stronger . This doesn't speak well for the logistical consistency of the series , but when has logic ever applied ? The Friday the 13th movies have always been the kind of movies that you watch at home on a late rainy night , usually best enjoyed with a bunch of friends and a 12-pack . I can't remember a time when a Friday the 13th movie has ever been scary , but I would be lying if I said I don't occasionally get a huge kick out of having a couple beers with my buddies and watching an old , bad horror movie , so what's so wrong with having a couple beers with my buddies and watching a new , bad horror movie ? Note : At one point in the movie , one of the characters says this line of dialogue - " Let's all be one big , happy cliché ! " I don't think I even need to comment on that .
544304	562732	183505	7.0	This is definitely the slapstick comedy that it was made out to be , but Jim Carrey , the master of modern slapstick comedy , makes it work .	I had high hopes for Me , Myself , and Irene , but mostly because I am a huge Jim Carrey fan . Clearly , the story of the film did not strike me as something truly ingenious , but it provided huge possibilities for Carrey to work his hilarious magic . While not nearly as good as some of his comedy classics , such as Dumb & Dumber , Me , Myself and Irene was very successful on many levels . ( spoilers ) One of the things that is seen here ( as is seen in many of Carrey's films ) is the criminal subplot that actually drives much of the comedy . In some cases , this provides for some irony that is actually pretty funny , but also makes you wonder about the message that is being delivered to this film's target audience ( ' ? somewhere along the line they get the idea that the cops are the bad guys - ' BAM ! ) . Well , in this case , the cops really ARE the bad guys . While the majority of the film was very successful as a comedy , I think that some things may have been a little bit blown out of proportion , or a little too childish . The cow , for example , which was ' lucky to be alive ' after Carrey shot it in the head six times and then tried to wrestle to death , was just too much . On the other hand , this kind of excess is not too unexpected , given the film's directors . Also , Carrey's three vulgar but hugely intelligent sons may have gone a little too far , but in this case , it was still really funny . They also ended the film in a charming way ? ' Thanks for watching our motherfkin ' movie ! ' I can't say that I loved Me , Myself , and Irene , but it was still a good comedy . Renee Zellweger gave a good performance as the object of the affection of both of Carrey's personalities in the film . And she also delivered a good kick to his jaw in one particularly amusing scene . The reason to watch this film is for the hilarious performance by Carrey as the two strikingly different colliding personalities , Hank and Charlie . The breathy sound of Hank's voice gets a little tiring pretty quick , but this doesn't take away from the laughs that are skillfully delivered .
544150	562732	374339	7.0	" Men are changed by events , not events by men . "	The last installment in the Infernal Affairs trilogy is surprisingly slow moving , but still has the high production values and intricate story of the first two , although as a whole it is slightly less engaging than the preceding films . There have been a lot of comparisons between this trilogy and The Godfather films , and the similarities in story-telling structure and the overall arc of the sequels are definitely there , although I have to admit that I think the Godfathers exist on an entirely different level as these films . The Infernal Affairs films are good , but they're not THAT good . There is a lot of work in bringing together the stories of the first two films and it definitely adds to them , but I found this one to be too slow moving , although the pace picked up by the third act and the final scene is definitely impressive . On the other hand , the trilogy ends on a serious downer - " Ksitigarbha Sutra - ' People of the like shall be cast into the Avinci Hell and will continue to suffer from Kalpas to Kalpas with no means of escape . ' I may as well just admit that I don't know the meaning or source of this quote , but it sure seems like a depressing note to end the trilogy on . Nevertheless , despite being just a little bit of a let-down ( like countless trilogy finales ) , Internal Affairs 3 is a necessary closure , and Asian cinema fans are sure to eat it up .
544038	562732	89869	8.0	Hasn't dated well , but still a good example of what good science fiction used to look like .	A scientist named Zac Hobson wakes up to discover what is probably either most people's worst nightmare or biggest fantasy , that he is that last man alive on earth . The emptiness of the post-apocalyptic world is the result of a top-secret energy project gone horribly wrong ( don't stories where everyone in the world has died or disappeared usually result from some top-secret project or another gone wrong ? ) . For a while Zac basks in the denial that there's no one else in the world , and indulges in his materialistic fantasies until reality , as it were , sets in , and he begins to search in earnest for other survivors . Ultimately he discovers two others , a man and a woman , and the resulting love triangle is strangely interesting although awkwardly portrayed . The three characters , however awkward , propel the rest of the story in the direction of the bizarre but truly memorable ending . The performances in the film are much better than you might expect from mid 1980s science fiction , and the atmosphere of emptiness and desolation is startlingly convincing . The film hasn't dated well , but it's still good fun . For some reason I have grouped this movie in my mind with Soylent Green , another old science fiction film memorable for its uniqueness and unexpectedness . Both are good for an evening of unusual entertainment . Science fiction fans are sure to eat it up .
544573	562732	116483	8.0	Adam Sandler has never been a real favorite of the critics , but Happy Gilmore is undeniably one of his most successfully hilarious comedies .	In Happy Gilmore , Sandler plays the part of a determined hockey player who doesn't make the team but soon inadvertently discovers that his hockey skills translate very nicely onto the golf green . Until the point in the film where Happy begins playing golf , most of the laughs come from his misfortune ( ' Happy Gilmore ? I called your name , didn't I ? ' [ eagerly ] ' No , you didn't . ' ' Oh , well , better luck next year ! ! ' ) , but it is the conflictive interaction between himself as a self-proclaimed hockey player and the much more formal and ( for lack of a better word ) high class game of golf that makes up the majority of the entertainment for the rest of the film . There is clearly a take on the classic odd-couple comedy structure here , as Sandler's vulgar hockey habits collide with the neatness and formality of the golf green , and for the most part , this comedy scheme works pretty well here . Sandler seems to adopt the character of Happy Gilmore with great relish as he displays violent acts of hilariously misplaced aggression , clearly foreshadowing his similar actions as Bobby Boucher in The Waterboy . Indeed , some of the funniest parts of the film come from his lengthy streams of profanity at the misbehaved ball when it doesn't go where he wants it to go ( ' PIECE ! ! OF ! ! MONKEY beep ! ! ' ) . So you have an undeniably entertaining and amusing character who does undeniably funny things , but it is at the logical level that this film falls on its face . Luckily for the movie and for its fans , this is not the most important element of a movie like this . It's not very likely that a slob like Happy , who doesn't make the hockey team , is going to suddenly find himself bringing in thousands and thousands of dollars left and right , and stick to his plan to buy his grandmother's house back . You would think that , having seen that he can make that much money , he would at least have kept going for a while instead of quitting as soon as he had accumulated enough to buy back the house . A noble cause , obviously , but no red blooded American male on the planet is going to just quit the game because he prefers hockey or he hates his lead opponent . But who cares ? Sandler delivers the steady stream of laughs as Gilmore with such skill that the comedy of the film far overshadows any such imperfections . Gilmore himself seems to be a bit overly violent in scenes where it doesn't seem entirely necessary , and there is clearly some overdone product placement , but it doesn't take away from the rest of the film . Mike Meyers made brilliant use of product placement in Wayne's World in such ways that added hugely to the comedy of the film ( although he tripped over this technique in Austin Powers 2 , when he made it massively over-emphasized and stonily unamusing ) , and the excessive violence of the Gilmore character is justified ( although just barely ) by the fact that his imperfect characteristics make his efforts ( or lack thereof ) to fit in with professional golfers even more amusing . As the pros stand around sipping expensive wine and discussing their respective accomplishments , Happy walks in asking where the pinball machine and the keg are . They want fame and recognition , he wants money and beer ( and Virginia , the sexy reporter who fills the role of the obligatory love interest in the typical Sandler film ) . There are a lot of scenes in Happy Gilmore that , as much as I personally enjoy the movie , simply fall flat ( many of which involve the homeless guy who Happy employs as his caddie , or the nutcase that Shooter McGavin employs to destroy Gilmore's chances of winning the tournament , or anything involving Chubbs ' prosthetic hand ) but the film succeeds where it is supposed to . Sandler presents Gilmore as a strangely likeable character , despite all of his destructive habits , and the film is peppered with other notable performances , not the least of which are by Carl Weathers as Chubbs , the former golf pro who takes upon himself the immense task of taming the wild Gilmore , and Christopher MacDonald , in yet another brilliantly hate-able role as the immutable Shooter McGavin . Happy Gilmore is a comedy from Adam Sandler , which means that you already know what kind of movie that you are going to get here , so don't complain if it turns out to be what you expected . Sandler does not make award-winning films , and chances are he never will , but the comedic value of Happy Gilmore is unquestionable . It is , to sum it up just as briefly as movies like this can be summed up , a perfect example of what I like to call Fast Food Cinema . It's a lot of fun , but there's no nutritional value .
544783	562732	220099	8.0	Tigger is back , and the only difference is that he is now OFFICIALLY stealing the show .	Okay , it's been 23 years since there has been a full length Winnie the Pooh film released , and the original fans have all grown up by now . But if you have ever been a fan of the Pooh gang , check out this movie . Take me , for example , I'm a 21 year old horror movie fanatic , and I loved The Tigger Movie . The whole gang is back in the 100 Acre Woods , and this time Tigger is making an effort to find his family , to no longer be the " onliest one . " The songs are original and amusing , the characters are still their same old lovable selves , and Tigger's play on words is just as hilarious as always ( " Sorry Piglet , but you're on the smallish side of tiny and a little bit lacking in verticality ! " ) . In the end , the message that the film delivers is much more important and heartwarming than it seems it will be at the beginning . It stresses the importance of a different kind of " family " than the traditional kind , and it ends up providing a message that can be appreciated by a much larger group of people . The Tigger Movie is a movie for people of all ages , it is very enjoyable and lots of fun .
544054	562732	61395	8.0	Considered by many to be Bunuel's greatest work , Belle de Jour is a prime example of Bunuel's affection for the juxtaposition of realism and surrealism , this time to present a picture of the unusual sexualit	Catherine Deneuve plays Séverine Serizy , an obviously unsatisfied wife of a man who does not mistreat her as much as he simply doesn't seem to interest her enough sexually . She is in a financially comfortable but otherwise largely uninteresting relationship with him . There are a lot of strange aberrant fantasies that are placed periodically throughout the film , the meaning of which pertains to what is going on in the characters ' lives at the times that they are presented . The movie starts off by showing a lengthy and rather disturbing example of one of these fantasies , in which Séverine is pulled from her carriage by the two drivers after her lukewarm response to her fiancée's marriage proposal , and then tied to a tree and beaten and raped . A scene this strange and disturbing this early in the movie immediately presents her as an unsatisfied woman searching for fulfillment outside of her marriage . The fantasy at the beginning of the film quickly reveals itself to be Séverine's , who otherwise appears to be fairly normal and well-adjusted . Séverine is involved in a relationship with Pierre , for whom she has feelings but none of them have anything to do with pleasure , and she constantly seeks other fulfillment , at first in fantasies and then by working part time at a brothel . There is a colorful variety of characters that frequent the brothel and whom Séverine does not always enjoy working with ( or for ) , but the exact activities that go on while she is at work are beside the larger point , which is that she is escaping the dreariness of a typical marriage and displaying some sort of sexual independence , which was a bad thing to do in Spain under the dictatorship of Franco ( and , as was the case in El Bruto , also serves as the reason that this movie could not possibly have been made in Spain in 1967 , given Franco's enormously oppressive censorship system ) . There are themes of dissatisfaction that run throughout the movie , even in small things like the fact that the champagne in the movie never seems to be cold enough , characters complaining that champagne is never that great if it's not cold enough , and things like this tie in with the dissatisfaction that is obviously prevalent in the marriage between Séverine and Pierre . One of the things that ties in closest with some of Bunuel's earlier films is the theme of the dishonesty from the woman , which is complicated in Belle de Jour by the irony that is involved in her dishonesty . She leads of double life , maintaining her respectable composure in her relationship with Pierre but also working as a prostitute named Belle de Jour a few times a week , fulfilling an erotic need that is never explained or displayed any more than absolutely necessary . Pierre is completely oblivious to what is going on in her life until late in the film when one of her shabby clients , who has fallen in love with her , shoots him , confining him to a wheelchair and blinding him . It's strange that Pierre is struck blind only when the truth begins to come out . His vision has been destroyed by the very thing that was causing his blindness throughout his entire relationship with Séverine . Pierre develops the feeling that he is a burden to Séverine , his ' pure ' wife , and wants to have his life ended since he's paralyzed . He does not want to burden her anymore , until Mr . Husson , the man who discovered what Séverine had been doing , let him know what was going on ( giving in to an understandable humane decision that it is simply not right to allow a man to torture himself over a woman who has herself led such a dishonest life in her relationship with him ) . ( spoilers ) At the end of the film , there is a fantasy which has been said to be possibly Séverine's and possibly Pierre's , but we are never told for sure which one , in which Pierre stands up out of his wheelchair , his sight restored , and they display a happy and healthy marriage . It seems to me that this is clearly a fantasy of Séverine's , which significantly suggests that , although it IS a fantasy and Pierre is still confined to a wheelchair , she no longer fantasizes about being beaten and raped and abused , and that she is ready to have a happy marriage and that Pierre is enough for her , despite being bound to a wheelchair . It seems to me that she has accepted herself as who she is and Pierre for who he is and , most importantly , his injury as a result of her own sexual digressions . A lifetime of loyalty is the LEAST she could give him .
544710	562732	240772	8.0	Hell yes .	The remake of Ocean's 11 is a tremendously entertaining movie . I personally find Brad Pitt and George Clooney to be among the most watchable actors working today , so I found the movie to be hugely appealing despite numerous plot holes , an almost nonstop barrage of clichés , a ridiculous ending , and Don Cheadle . Before I go on , I should mention that I think Cheadle is an immensely talented actor with some great performance's under his belt , such as his work in Boogie Nights , Traffic , and A Lesson Before Dying ( sure , he can't pronounce Vladivostok , but it was still a great performance ) . The problem with his character here , probably the most controversial role of the entire movie , is that he was forced to take on this ridiculous accent , making him the Jar Jar Binks of Ocean's 11 . Pretty sad , but I hope it serves as a lesson for how dumb it is to have well known actors take on thick accents . It does nothing but call attention to itself and invite criticism for the actor's ability to pull it off . And given the content of the discussion boards on the IMDb , Cheadle didn't pull it off so well . That being said , the rest of the movie is enormously entertaining , even though Andy Garcia , who I have had an unjustifiable aversion to ever since Desperate Measures , turns his character of the ridiculously rich Terry Benedict , owner of three casinos in Las Vegas , into an almost cartoonish villain . George Clooney plays the title character Danny Ocean , recently released from prison where he had plenty of time to develop intricate plots for robbing three casinos simultaneously . The parole board asks him if he thinks he would ever return to a life of crime were he released , he smiles , gets released , and promptly returns to a life of crime . This is the kind of character that Clooney was born to play . Brad Pitt plays Ocean's Second , the second man in charge and much of the pull behind getting this whole thing together . We get the usual montage of hilarious antics being committed by those that are to be sought to be among Ocean's 11 ( edited together on the same template used to introduce us to the colorful characters in Armageddon ) , each one fulfilling the need for another stereotype . In this way , the movie is pretty weak , but it is so entertaining to watch the robberies pulled off that it makes up for a lot of these shortcomings . Brad Pitt lends his massive presence to the film as Rusty , an old friend of Danny's . Rusty is an interesting character , sort of a freelancer in Vegas , living his life in the casinos , obviously raking in comfortable amounts of cash from his less than legal endeavors , and willing only to dress in the highest of fashion . Strange , however , for a man to constantly wear such high priced clothing when he is ALWAYS eating . Matt Damon plays the part of the pickpocket , whose skills come into good use in the plot in ways which I will not reveal , Don Cheadle plays the demolitions expert , Bernie Mac gets a great role as a card dealer with a not so clean past , and Elliott Gould makes a huge turn from his character in American History X to play the part of a washed up con man , eager for revenge against Terry Benedict , who put him out of business . The idea is to rob the central safe that stores the cash for the three casinos in question . Supposedly this is the most ingenious and impenetrable vault ever created by mankind ( as this is generally how it is described throughout the movie ) , which begs the question of why the blueprints for the vault are kept under the watchful eye of a cheaply rented night security guard . That's like leaving the keys to Fort Knox in plain view outside the vault and protected by a thin pane of glass . ( spoilers ) Complicating matters , conveniently for the script , is the little factoid that Benedict is now dating Ocean's ex-wife , who left him because he was involved in a life of crime . It's interesting to see the movie take place in what is to me the familiar setting of Las Vegas , but it is not enough to distract attention from the disastrous romantic content of the movie . Not only does Tess ( Roberts ) come off as a stiff and exceedingly unpleasant woman , but she left Danny in the first place for being a criminal and landing himself in prison . Then he pulls off this astronomical heist , stealing millions and millions of dollars from her current love interest ( as well as managing to get him to admit on camera that he cares more about money than he does about Tess ) , and THEN she wants him back . What , she didn't want to be with him before because his criminal life landed him in prison , but now she wants him back because he's GOOD at being a criminal ? Please . Nevertheless , while the ending almost completely ruined the movie because it leaves such a bad aftertaste , the rest of the film is hugely entertaining , bad fake accents notwithstanding . There are lots of twists and turns , lots of people get what is coming to them , and as is to be expected from a movie starring Brad Pitt , George Clooney , Matt Damon and Julia Roberts , the star power is substantial . It ends badly , but it's great up to that point . It's just too bad that the bad part is so near the end and therefore in the front of your mind at the end of the movie .
544055	562732	290003	8.0	That nativity scene is too much for me !	In a lot of ways I am surprised at the sheer simplicity of these old Bean TV shows , but that nativity scene was one of the funniest things I have ever seen in one of his shows . It reminds me of Chaplin's dance of the dinner rolls . It is so simple , but clearly a stroke of true genius . Recently I watched all of Chaplin's earliest comedies , and now as I watch these Bean episodes , it's clear to me that Bean is the closest thing that we have to the great silent comedy . He is essentially a silent slapstick artist like the old greats like Chaplin and Keaton and Fatty Arbuckler , but with his own personality . Bean definitely lives in his own little world ! I have to say that I was less than impressed with the turkey preparation scene , it's just a little too , ah , meaty for me . I love eating meat , but something about a gigantic raw turkey getting stuck on someone's head is a little off-putting to me . But the nativity scene , the Christmas stockings , and other things like the tainted clams scenes are definite classics !
544350	562732	289941	8.0	Mr . Bean stumbles belligerently through a series of routine daily events , each one going horribly wrong and treating the audience to another dose of unintentional hilarity as only Bean can .	This is the first time I have seen any of the old Bean TV shows that aired in the UK before the movie was released here in the states in 1997 . I was reminded of some of Roberto Benigni's older films , such as Johnny Stecchino , which I watched because I was endlessly impressed with Life Is Beautiful . As in Benigni's case , the comedy in Bean's older TV show is virtually identical to that in his movie . Some of the scenes go on for a little too long , such as the diving board scene , but there are some scenes that just about knocked me off the couch I was laughing so hard , such as the television scene . When Bean is inching along the chair on his belly , crawling steadily closer to the TV so he can see it , he finally gets to a point where he can see the screen , and the second he turns his head toward it the reception goes out again . Believe me , this is a lot funnier in the show than it is in my review . It was totally predictable but completely side-splitting , I loved it . The swimming pool scene is followed by two only slightly less amusing skits , one involving a remarkably complex lunch in the park that just goes all wrong in the end and the other involving a date to a horror movie which , as with the diving board scene , goes on for a little too long . The next episode contains three more scenes that are entertaining in their own little Beany way , but none of which come close to the TV scene in the first episode . There is also a bonus skit at the end during which Bean makes extensive and hilarious efforts to get to the front of the line at the bus stop , even going so far as to cut in front of a mother with a baby carriage and to trick a blind man into thinking that the bus is there and then stepping into the street . I think we all know how this ends , and it's strange that Bean's comedy can be so predictable and still be so entertaining . Excellent source of light comedy and even insightfulness , at least in that it is interesting ( although obvious ) to consider why the bus stop skit was not previously shown on television . Not exactly the most intellectual entertainment , but the quality is there .
544026	562732	88944	8.0	The ultimate action b-classic !	When I was a kid I may have been the biggest Commando fan ever . I think I must have watched it at least 30 times or so , I used to watch it every day after school . It is totally cheesy and Arnold is basically a superhero not far removed from Rambo other than by the fact that he has more honorable intentions . Rambo was just mentally destroyed by his military experience , while Schwartzenegger's John Matrix was turned into a nearly perfect military fighting machine but just wanted to live a normal life , but was forced back into action when his daughter is kidnapped . Now that I'm older I notice that it's a little strange that nothing is ever said about Matrix's wife , the mother of his daughter Jenny , an early role for Alyssa Milano . But at any rate , he has certainly done well for himself , living together with Jenny in an absolutely beautiful mountain home with spectacular views of the valley below . We are introduced to John as he is carrying an enormous tree trunk through the woods back towards his house to chop up for firewood . This is how he spends his time , you see . His relationship with his daughter is shown through a cloyingly cheesy musical montage of them skipping along and holding hands and putting ice cream in each other's faces and whatnot . We get it , we get it . But I'll tell you why I love the movie . Jenny is kidnapped by terrorists who try to force him to commit an assassination in order to win her freedom . In one of the best scenes in the movie , Matrix is escorted onto an airplane by one of the terrorists , who he manages to kill before take-off and disguise as a sleeping passenger , and then he makes his way to the undercarriage of the plane , literally tearing through canvas barriers and whatnot , and onto the landing gear , flinging himself off of the plane upon take-off and landing in a swamp below . He then has until the plane lands in the distant country to rescue his daughter before the bad guys learn he wasn't on the plane . Arnold long ago said that guns are his one love in all of his movies , and this one is no exception . I don't know why it is so fascinating to me , because I am not a fan of guns myself , but when he breaks into that gun shop and fills shopping carts with guns and grenades and whatnot , I always feel like a kid in a candy store . There is a slightly awkward relationship between John and Cindy , a woman with whom he had a very rough introduction but who soon sided with him to help him rescue his daughter . There is no chemistry whatsoever between John and Cindy ( presenting a convincing romantic relationship has never been one of Arnold's strong points ) , but they make an interesting enough team as they make their way closer and closer to Bennett , the big bad guy and one of Matrix's old enemies . There are some outstandingly overblown gunfights and explosions and car chases , but it is all so much fun that I can't really say anything bad about it . Like all good bad b-movies , Commando is packed with explosions and firepower and dynamite and guns and grenades and whatnot , but still comes down to a hand to hand knife-fight at the end and is packed with cheesy one-liners , except that some of them in this movie are genuinely entertaining and amusing . This is not high class action , but it is definitely tons of fun !
544726	562732	339542	8.0	Interesting analysis .	The full first half of this supplemental documentary concentrates on what almost comes off as a conspiracy theory about the likelihood of a biological weapon being launched somewhere in the world , causing an epidemic of disease that wipes out a frightening number of the people on earth , similar to what happens in the movie . It's up for debate about how justified that concern is , because people have been talking about how we're on the verge of nuclear war for decades , and now it appears that , despite all of the terrorism in the world , the likelihood of sovereign nations knowingly destroying each other gets less every year . Or maybe I'm just not tuned in to the level of hatred that is taking place in the world today . More interesting is the second half , which talks a lot about the production of the movie , how they did the make-up for the infected victims and how they emptied the streets of London for those opening shots , as well as plenty of commentary about what the people involved thought about the subject matter . For me , the only drawback seems to be that the discussions of past pandemics and the possibility of future pandemics are conducted with such inevitable conviction that it makes them come off as just a little bit hysterical . Yeah , the danger is there , but the danger of something is always there . In modern times , it just seems to me that mankind is more likely to reach a higher level of peace if we all stop trying to predict pandemics and wars and terrorist attacks and start trying to live in peace with our neighbors . I don't see a lot of that effort going on these days ?
544388	562732	112864	9.0	The return of John McTiernan ! !	I was pretty thoroughly disappointed with Die Hard 2 , but that might have made watching Die Hard 3 even better , because it was so good to see such an immediate and clear improvement over the first sequel . The movie begins in Harlem , where a terrorist has forced John McClane to go wearing a huge sign with a slogan on it that is sure to get him shot in minutes . The villain is Simon Gruber , the brother of Hans Gruber , the bad guy from the original movie , and he plays a vicious game of Simon Says with McClane , forcing him to do things that endanger his life . Gruber has detonated a bomb in a department store and asked the frantic police for McClane by name , intending to play games with him and ultimately avenge his brother's death . Things have not been going well for McClane . He's been suspended from the force , his marriage is falling apart and he's now a full-blown alcoholic . It is only Gruber's personal request for him that brings him back into use from the police force , and Gruber has him running frantically around New York with the unwilling company of store owner Zeus Carver ( a brilliant performance from Samuel L . Jackson ) , who wants nothing to do with McClane but is coerced into going along . The action is brilliant and the story lives up to the original , with McClane ultimately figuring out that the cat and mouse game that Gruber is forcing him to play is a ploy to distract him and the rest of the police force while Gruber pulls off a much greater crime . A couple of brilliant plot twists and a slew of great performances are a great sign for the Die hard series , which was headed in an unflattering direction after Die Hard 2 . See this one !
544473	562732	120363	9.0	A strong follow-up to the tremendous 1995 hit , Toy Story , but the sequel is not quite up to the same standards as the original .	First of all , it should be noted that when I say that Toy Story 2 is not up to the standards of its predecessor , I do not mean the computer animation , which is just as spectacular as it was in 1995 , if not better . One of the things that the 1995 version really tried to do ( to some extent ) was to avoid actually showing human faces . We never see the faces of adults particularly , and the faces of the children that we saw ( such as Andy , the vicious Sid , and his pathetic little sister ) are obviously animated and do not fit in with the level of reality achieved by the rest of the film . In Toy Story 2 , we see a lot more faces , and while they're still never done quite right , it's good to see that they have made a significant improvement in this area . In the original Toy Story , we were so fascinated to see a presentation of the real life that we all imagined that our toys had when we were away that that was enough to make a great story for a great film , while in the sequel we are taken a lot deeper into the lives of our toys , which possess a lot more than even the extensive amount of emotion seen in the first film . The toys seem to possess a much deeper sense of neglect than was made clear by their competition over who is the favorite toy in the first movie , and we are even treated to an overly emotional and altogether unnecessary song called ' When She Loved Me , ' which really only serves to sadden the entire film and slow it down . There is an entirely new antagonist presented in the character of Big Al , the toy baron who desperately seeks Woody as the last toy to complete a classic collector set which he is planning on selling for some huge amount of money . We learn about Woody's past in this way , and he is faced with the conflict of staying with his friends ( Andy's toys , as well as Andy himself ) , or returning to what I guess would be called his family , with the unfortunate addition that if he decides to do that , he will remain in a box and be looked at the rest of his existence , never to be played with or loved by a child again . The characters , thankfully , have all returned for the second movie , and we are again treated to a great show of hilarious adventure with them all , including a wonderful scene in which Buzz Lightyear finally encounters the evil Emperor Zurg , which results in a great toy battle scene that plays respectfully ( note that , Kevin Smith , RESPECTFULLY ) off of the battle between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader in The Empire Strikes Back . The movie is yet another marvel of animation from the people at Pixar , and it does not fail in the least to generate laughs ( see , for example , the ultimate result of the battle between Zurg and Buzz ) . Where the movie goes wrong ( and , it should be noted , it goes VERY slightly wrong ) is where it tries to insert too much emotion and sadness where it really doesn't belong . It was enough in the first film to see that Woody was so heartbroken as he watched Andy's interest in him begin to fade , but the sequel erroneously thinks that the audience should have tears brought to their eyes , which is just not true . But despite being overly emotional , Toy Story 2 captures the wonderful level of adventure and entertainment that made the original film so memorable , and it solidly earns itself a place as one of the great animated films . Fans of the original film are sure to love it , just beware of an excessive amount of emotion presented in the film . It's a comedy with a little too much heart , which makes it a little lop-sided , but the adventure is undeniably strong .
544021	562732	209958	9.0	Every once in a while a film comes along that stands apart from all others made in years . The Matrix did it last year , and The Cell has done it in 2000 .	The last film that provided a vivid and disturbing look at what insanity is probably like was In Dreams . In that movie , you didn't see insanity , you were THERE . Now The Cell comes along with an updated and much more disturbing portrayal of the inside of the mind of a psychotic killer . The opening scene takes you into the seemingly innocent mind of a comatose little boy , and the things that Catherine Deane ( Jennifer Lopez ) sees are first fascinating and then terrifying . The things that she later sees in the mind of Vincent Stargher ( Vincent D'Onofrio ) are amazingly imaginative and fascinating , most of this stuff has never been seen in film before . The story of The Cell is not exactly something that is really groundbreaking . In fact , it is basically the same as the story in The Silence of the Lambs . You have a killer in custody and these people have to enter his mind to find a female victim who is currently in danger of losing her life . The only real difference between the foundation of the plots is that in The Silence of the Lambs , you have to enter the mind of a killer to find a different killer as well as his current victim , while in The Cell , you have to enter the mind of a killer to find his own victim . However , despite the unfortunately weak story , The Cell completely revolutionizes the genre of the psychological thriller . None that have ever been made even come close to it . Also , the film had good direction and was extremely well acted . Vince Vaughn delivers another of his characteristically excellent performances ( he was even good as Norman Bates in the pathetic 1998 re-make of Psycho ) , and even Jennifer Lopez puts forth the second good effort of her career ( the other being the great Out of Sight ) . Nothing can be said of the cinematography in The Cell to give it sufficient credit , it was imaginative and fascinatingly done and is unparalleled by anything ever seen in cinematic history . The Cell is an incredibly well-made film , and it deserves to be recognized .
544224	562732	4194	9.0	Vertigo's got nothing on this rooftop sequence ! !	That's not really true , of course , but the level of action and the quality and style of editing in this film is leaps and bounds above a lot of the kinds of films that were coming out at the time , even the ones that Chaplin himself was directing . The first 15 minutes of the film , the build-up to the boxing match , are noticeably slow and almost eventless , but the last ten minutes are so action packed and so frantically fast paced that it almost feels like a full length film . Fatty Arbuckle stars in this tale of a fixed boxing match gone horribly wrong , and it has slapstick violence , Charlie Chaplin as a referee who doesn't seem to know that he's not supposed to get involved with the fight , gunfights , police chases , and Arbuckle dragging the whole precinct of officers attached to a rope into the ocean off of a pier . There's intrigue , betrayal , romance , crime , comedy , and illegal gambling . There is so much going on in this film that it's amazing how short it is . Chaplin didn't write or direct this film , and in reality was only a co-star , but this is one of the best films I've seen in the Chaplin collection I have . Chaplin at the time was a very inexperienced filmmaker , and he wasn't really turning out anything better than this at the time that it was made . He became much better than this later in his career , obviously , but any Chaplin fan should not miss this one .
544229	562732	321032	9.0	Cool supplemental documentary that gives insight into a great movie .	This quick documentary gives some pretty interesting insights into the making of Bullitt , which I found to be especially interesting because so much of the film was shot not only on location , but on very difficult locations . Steve McQueen is something of a stuntman in real life , given his extensive interests in motorcycle and car racing , so naturally he wanted to do as many of his own stunts as possible , and I think that kind of dedication really comes across in the film . When stuntmen are used in movies there are so many times when you can just tell , even if you can't really see their faces , and I think it takes away from the movies as a whole . There is also a lot of interesting footage of the cast and crew working on location , behind the scenes , and this DVD includes some pretty interesting information about the research that some actors did in preparation for their roles , such as riding along with SFPD officers to learn how they worked , as well as using real doctors and nurses in the hospital scenes . Overall an interesting documentary , and definitely worth the ten minutes it will take to watch it !
544628	562732	43274	9.0	A wonderful Disney adaptation of Lewis Carroll's classic novels .	I was a little worried when I went to watch the film version of Alice In Wonderland , because I just read the novel and Disney has a tendency to dumb down the material that they make into their films with goofball romantic nonsense and cutesy talking animals . While I did get more than the traditional share of talking animals with this film ( as well as a variety of other inanimate objects ) , the film stayed more faithful to the original story than is generally expected from a Disney film . On the other hand , this WAS made in 1951 , which makes me wonder what a more modern adaptation would look like . I read Alice In Wonderland and Through The Looking Glass for English 180 ( Children's Literature ) at the University of California , Davis , so needless to say , I read it with more of a literary appreciation than is generally applied to children's books . I was pleased to see so many of the characters from the second novel in this version of Alice In Wonderland ( such as the Cheshire Cat , the talking flowers in the garden , and Tweedle-Dee and Tweedle-Dum ) , although I must admit that I was slightly disappointed to see that Through The Looking Glass has been assimilated into this version of Alice In Wonderland rather than adapted into its own film , which I think is an honor that it certainly deserves . As far as being a full length feature ( although rather short at roughly 75 minutes ) , however , I think that this movie does justice to both stories , converting them into a single story rather smoothly , and only leaving out things that will only really be missed by people who know the novels enough to be disappointed that certain things were not included . I , for example , would have loved to see the whole chess story in Through The Looking Glass included in the film ( there certainly was time for it ) , where Alice travels through Wonderland on her quest to become a Queen herself , but I am more than happy with how this film turned out . One of the only things that I noticed about this film that did not match up to the quality of the novels is that the books have so much more in them for adults than the movie does . There are so many tricks with language pulled in the books , such as in the conversations with Tweedle-Dee and Tweedle-Dum as well as several other characters , that it really makes you think about the English language as a game with which an endless variety of tricks can be played . In the film , this is hugely downplayed , even if only because it is done visually and the language tricks pass by so fast that kids are almost certain to miss them and even the most attentive of adults will have a hard time keeping up with them . As a whole , however , Alice In Wonderland is so wildly entertaining that the loss of some of the literary substance does not detract from it as a terrific tale of adventure and discovery , certain to be enjoyed by people of all ages . I have heard plenty of rumors that Lewis Carroll was on any of a variety of drugs while he wrote the novels ( and plenty of rumors that he wasn't on any drugs at all ) , but there are certainly some things in the books and in the movie that could have only been conjured up by the most , um , eccentric of imaginations . We may never know for sure , but at least we have some wonderful entertainment . Read the books to your kids .
544720	562732	5074	9.0	Chaplin in a movie about punching people . What else do you need ?	It seems natural that at the very start of Chaplin's career he should make a movie in which he plays a grossly unqualified boxer who succeeds by sneaking horse shoes into his gloves . I only wonder why it didn't happen even earlier . He passes a sign saying that sparring partners are wanted , people who know how to take a punch , and heads in . We see him grow increasingly concerned as one guy after another , all bigger and stronger than him , get up to fight and return in a state of dazed semi-consciousness . A lot of times when I watch these early comedies from Chaplin , I get the feeling that he is often trying to create at least a mildly engaging story throughout which he can throw in a lot of kicking and punching scenes , but in this movie it's the kicking and punching the drives the plot , giving the film an unusually honest feel . High-energy physical slap-stick is what Chaplin did best at that time , and smacking around a huge mountain of a man while he dances carelessly around as only he can is certainly a treat to watch . And the climactic battle between Charlie and the meaty Bob Uppercut ( or Young Hippo , depending on which cannibalized version you may see ) is well-acted and fun . Mack Sennett like his comedies to be fast paced and high energy , without too much time wasted on things like characterization or even story . But in The Champion , Chaplin proves that we can have well-developed characters , an easily discernible story , and still have enough action and solid slap-stick to keep the shorter attention spanned audience members entertained . This is definitely one of the best short comedies that Chaplin had made up to that point .
544618	562732	230512	9.0	Interesting story of a guy who became an accidental rock star .	I remember listening to Rodney Bingenheimer's radio show on KROQ when I was in high school . I knew nothing of him at the time and only know what I know now because of what I learned from this movie , but regardless of how popular Rodney became with the rock stars and celebrities and regardless of how well his show ever did , the guy just does not have a voice for radio . I think that in his case it is vital that you know him personally or that you know about his history in the music business , because listening to him as a radio talk show host is intolerably boring . It is not a surprise , to say the least , that his radio show never strayed far from the midnight to 3am shift on Sundays , although I would rather listen to him than Jed the Fish any day of the week . Jed the Fish irritates the hell out of me . Speaking of which , one of the more interesting things that I learned from this documentary was actually just proof of something that I had always suspected , that Jed the Fish has always been faking that ridiculous accent that he always talks with on the air . In his brief interviews in the movie he makes the mistake of talking in his regular voice , revealing how much of a fake he really is . On the other hand , he is , in fact , an entertainer , so I don't want to give the impression that he is some kind of fraud because he talks with a fake accent on the air . He's been on KROQ for some ridiculous number of years , so he must be doing something right . Not my thing , I guess . I think I may have just developed this contempt for KROQ for ruining great songs and popularizing bad songs in the ten years or so since I first moved to Irvine and started listening to them . The thing that I really liked about this documentary is that it really gives good insight into the life of Rodney Bingenheimer , who seems like some geeky guy who made his way into rock stardom by a simple love of music and what must have been a very disarming and unusually charming demeanor . For some reason he reminds me of this 1978 Honda Civic that I had in high school , it was the crappiest car in the parking lot but everyone loved it . I remember lots all the hot Flygirls used to always want to drive it , it was like a toy . Interpret that as you will , I still haven't figured it out . There are moments in the film when I almost felt bad for being so bored by Rodney's radio program , because despite having been experienced far more than every high school kid's dreams of the , ah , fleshy pearls of rock and roll decadence , Rodney has been through a lot of pain in his life . He had some truly heartbreaking experiences in his life growing up , which are kind of manifested in scenes like the one where he goes to visit his parents , with whom he had something of a falling out , and finds that they don't have any pictures of him in the front room . The saddest thing is that he brings the camera crew into a back room and points to a picture of himself , framed on hung on the wall but almost hidden in a corner where no one would ever see it . And he acted like it was perfectly normal . Rodney's demeanor that thing that really leaves the film open to interpretation . Despite having just watched a documentary about the guy , I feel like I know less about him than I knew before , just because he is such a closed off kind of person . There are scenes when he genuinely loses his temper , and there are scenes where he is clearly uncomfortable and comes right out and says that he doesn't want to talk about certain things , but at the same time he discloses information about himself that almost anyone else would probably find embarrassing . This is one of the rare instances in documentary film-making where you can learn so much about a person but come away from it amazed at how little you really know about him . It's like the old saying , the more I learn , the more I realize I don't know . Rodney is a truly unique person with a truly unique personality , and while I can't claim to have been entertained by his radio show even for a minute , he is certainly a fascinating person to learn about . Especially since I went to high school listening to the kind of music that he introduced to the world and I now live in the area that is portrayed in the movie . All music fans should watch this .
543931	562732	942385	9.0	Never go full-retard !	Like many movies these days , Tropic Thunder starts with a few previews . One is an advertisement for an energy drink called " Booty Sweat , " another is for a belligerent action movie called Scorcher ( so good that it commanded five sequels ) , then there's a low-brow comedy about hugely fat people that communicate entirely through flatulence ( lampooning those intolerable and endless endurance tests where Eddie Murphy or Martin Lawrence star as every character in the movie ) , and finally a religious drama involving homosexual priests . The soundtrack , of course , is by Enigma . Tropic Thunder is so overflowing with farcical ideas that they had to include a few theatrical trailers just to get the ideas in there , and what follows is exactly the kind of movie that you would expect to exist in a world that featured such previews . The story is about three Hollywood movie stars making a dramatic Vietnam film together . Jack Black is the drug addicted Jeff Portnoy , Robert Downey Jr . plays Kirk Lazarus , the token blackface guy , and Ben Stiller plays the curiously named Tugg Speedman , an overrated actor hoping to save his suffering career with this latest cheesy war movie . The movie starts with a scene on the set of the movie within the movie , including one of the movie's two spoofs of Willem Dafoe's frightening death in Platoon ( a tasteless joke that is one of Tropic Thunder's few blunders ) . Mortally wounded , Tugg is given the obligatory dying words speech where he gets to finally tell Lazarus his true feelings . Unable to get the words out , he calls for a cut . The director wants to keep rolling , Lazarus is getting irritated , and in the ensuing confusion , the pyrotechnics guy ( Danny McBride , stealing the show again ) accidentally wastes a $4 million explosion . Given that the Director , the also curiously named Damien Cockburn , managed to fall a full month behind schedule within the first five days of shooting , his producer is unimpressed . Enter Tom Cruise . Oh . My . God . YES . Cruise plays Les Grossman , a big shot Hollywood producer with no fuse . Lately I have been of the opinion that Cruise's acting career was in genuinely dire straits , given his bizarre behavior in his personal life , but this movie restored my faith in him 100 % , he is absolutely brilliant in this movie . He is one of the most watchable characters in the film , even though he is meant to be such an unsightly presence . Someone should win a make-up award just for what they did to his hands ! But , strangely for an action / spoof / comedy , Tropic Thunder is an actor's movie and a writer's movie . The script is loaded with gems and homages that manage to generate laughs without being belligerently perverse and tasteless like the Scary Movies etc . Ben Stiller deserves enormous credit for his part in the writing and directing , although his performance is one of the only real let-downs in the film . He goes through the motions of his limited repertoire , giving us essentially the exact performance he has played so many times before . It's Zoolander in Vietnam . Thankfully , Jack Black goes to town with his role . It's clear that he was having a blast making the movie , and it's hard not to join him . But the real show-stopper is Robert Downey Jr , who is so brilliant as the white Australian actor in blackface ( the movie's most famous Hollywood jab ) that I found myself hoping for a spin off sequel for his character . More than once , and in true Zoolander fashion , Speedman gets into a deep conversation about how to most efficiently perfect his acting style . Robert Downey Jr . steals every scene it is CLASSIC . Once in the jungle , the cast gradually realize the reality of their situation , as they become inadvertently involved with a deadly drug ring . We don't learn much about them and they are a confusing bunch , since they are located in Vietnam but look Korean and speak Chinese , and they're headed by a little kid . And what a little kid , man . Holy crap . This kid is like a cross between that child emperor from Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom and , say , a Tazmanian devil . Oh , and he has lots of guns and a war face that would make Stonewall Jackson cringe . You may find yourself wondering where they found this prodigal psycho - killer . A quick glance at his miniscule filmography will solve that little puzzle . Sesame Street ! ! Matthew McConaughey , proud owner of the most difficult last name in Hollywood , has a meaningless bit part as Speedman's airy agent . I don't expect brilliant character depth in a movie like this , but his character is just too obviously thrown in as shock value , which the movie surely doesn't need . He is unconcerned , for example , when Speedman calls him afraid for his life , but flies into an uncontrollable rage when he learns that his client is without access to a working Tivo machine . What the hell ? Then again , Tivo plays a pivotal role in the final act of the film , and not just as product placement , of which Tropic Thunder has prodigious amounts , and which it also lambasts along with a whole slew of other b-movie clichés . Tropic Thunder has the funniest beginning to any movie that I've seen in recent memory , and also the funniest ending . I wanted to cheer as the movie opened , and I left the same way . It's a comedy the likes of which rarely comes along . Pineapple Express is another similarly outstanding comedy currently in theaters , I recommend that you don't miss either of them !
544043	562732	362590	9.0	" I got a plan , and it's just as good as God's ? "	I have to admit that after about 20 minutes of this movie I was this close to just turning it off and moving on to The Grudge , which I watched right afterwards . Man , I'm glad I didn't , though , because this movie goes from pretty boring to not so bad to pretty good to VERY good . It's odd that this film has been so completely overlooked by critics and denounced by IMDb reviewers , who either understood how well-made this movie is ( especially the script , which is brilliant ) or it went completely over their heads and they couldn't wait to log on and berate the film as a total failure . One reviewer calls the movie " the dregs , " but then again this genius also gave Memento ( probably one of the three best films released in 2000 ) a vote of , so utter cluelessness coming from this person is hardly lightning out of a clear sky for unexpectedness . Another user gave it a lukewarm response , but also called Lost In Translation a real yawner , American History X " waaaaaaaay overrated , " A . I . " the most boring movie I've ever slept through , " and the absolutely ridiculous 2003 Texas Chainsaw remake " one of the better slasher flicks " ( ! ! ) . Now , I hesitate to call this last user clueless , because he really seems like a nice guy ( I'm sure he's a good father as well ) , but his list of reviews betrays the fact that he may be wired completely backwards when it comes to movies . The Texas Chainsaw remake better than A . I . , Lost in Translation , and American History X ? ? PLEASE . Now , I normally don't go on this much about what other people have to say about any given movie . Notice that I'm not getting into the two external reviews posted for the film ( Scott Weinberg and Movie House Commentary , at the time of this writing ) , which is amazing because they are both so completely wrong that it's difficult not to elaborate on my incredulous disbelief . It's sad that when a movie comes along that is actually well-written , so many people can't resist comparing it to a similar film that came out previously , completely ignoring the new film's good qualities and simply writing it off as a rip-off . This happened a lot with the wonderful comedy Runaway Bride , about which so many people immediately said things like " You know , I've seen this movie before . . . When it was called Pretty Woman " like it just absolutely must make them the cleverest person on earth . Personally , when I see a movie that looks stupid but turns out to be a very well-made thriller ( like Wild Things ) , I don't generally complain when a similar movie comes along , as long as it is also well-made and stands on its own , and Employee of the Month certainly does that . There are scenes in the movie that I thoroughly disliked , such as some stupid sex jokes , too much profanity , and anything involving dead people and jewelry , but Steve Zahn is great in his role , Matt Dillon gives a wonderful performance in a well-written character , and the plot twists start small and then get faster and faster and by the time they're done you're halfway through the end credits . People are really quick to criticize the twists in this movie . The twists are either too predictable or too unpredictable or there are too many of them or they're dumb or some other such nonsense . When the twists first started I was impressed by where the movie was going , because I thought it was going to be something completely different , but by the last one the movie had made very clear that many of the twists were done with tongue firmly in cheek , that you were meant to have a good time . This movie is all in good fun , and while it slips up by getting a little too vulgar for its own good from time to time , it most definitely deserves to be compared to Office Space , because it is certainly one of the great dark comedies .
543941	562732	397101	9.0	Hoodoo voodoo we do ! !	VGS fans will get that , but for everyone else I recommend just checking out this movie . I rented The Skeleton Key mostly because for the last few months I have been trying to watch every movie that comes out . Netflix has provided me with the opportunity of just adding all the new movies to my queue and not having to try and remember all of the movies that I've missed , which I always did before , given the constant barrage of new releases . I know I'll never catch up ( my Netflix queue is approaching the 300 mark ) , but it's at times like this that I'm glad that I try to watch all of the movies that come out ( Hellraiser 8 left me with a different sentiment entirely ) . One of the first things that struck me about The Skeleton Key was that it is a great horror movie to take a date to see . It focuses on creating a solid story and building tension rather than blood and gore , which with rare exceptions is how the best horror films are made anyway . Kate Hudson plays Caroline , an aspiring nurse who quits her job at a hospital because of their intolerable lack of concern over deaths , she doesn't feel right about working at a hospital that sees their patients as so much of a business and has little humane interest in them . When a patient passes away and is whisked away with the trash she decides she's had enough and starts combing the classifieds for something a little more personal . She finds a job as a live-in caregiver for a woman and her husband , who has suffered a massive stroke that affected both sides of his body , and it's not long before we learn that Caroline herself lost her father , so suddenly , in fact , that she was unable to help care for him at the end of his life , hence her overwhelming determination to provide the best care possible . Caroline is given a skeleton key that will open every door in the house , but when she finds one door hidden in the attic that the key doesn't open , obviously it takes on the most intrigue of all of the rooms in the house . There is a lot of stuff about voodoo and cults in the movie , and while it is really the backbone of the film it is not what makes it good . The movie is good because it has history behind it . It takes its time in getting started , but that's important because it takes the time necessary to tell the story behind what goes on in the movie . And probably most importantly , in my opinion , is that the movie was filmed on an old plantation house in Louisiana that actually housed well over a hundred slaves , which not only adds intrigue but relevance as well . There's a point about three quarters of the way through the movie that it seems that it's going to pan out in a pretty predictable way , but there's a great twist near the end that , while it is certainly a turn away from what may have been expected , it also has the enviable quality of giving the impression that the movie had to go that way all along , which is one of the first lessons I learned about storytelling back in college , that a good story cannot be predictable , yet the ending has to seem perfectly natural , that it could only have ended the way it did . And while this movie could certainly have ended in other ways , it wouldn't have been as good as it is if it had ended any other way . Also make sure to check out the surprising number of extra features on the DVD , particularly John Hurt's story and the story of the house in which the movie was filmed .
544294	562732	58461	9.0	" When a man's got money in his pocket he begins to appreciate peace . "	I can't even count how many years I have been wandering the videos stores and repeatedly pausing at the old Clint Eastwood classics before reluctantly moving on . But now that I live in China and can openly buy the entire Man with No Name trilogy for the equivalent of about $1 . 20 , I decided to finally check them out . The first thing that struck me about the original film is how simple it is . Granted , it's 1964 and a western , but due to the massive iconography this character has , I guess I expected a few more badass scenes . As I'm writing this , there is a curious review on the home page of Fistful of Dollars by a reviewer who calls himself dtucker86 who strangely mentions that " Clint Eastwood was as best known to American audiences for his role as Rowdy Yates in the series Rawhide . " Strange to me because , first of all Clint Eastwood is still alive even today , a full four years after that review was written ( and thus really shouldn't be referred to as " WAS best known " ) , but I happen to be a member of American audiences and I've never seen or heard of the TV show Rawhide . Of course , that's going to be attributed to my personal lack of familiarity with mid-20th century TV shows . Indeed , I've never seen a single episode of The Sopranos , so my ignorance of past TV shows should come as no surprise . A Fistful of Dollars is a very storied film , directed by Italian film-making giant Sergio Leone , a man who can't speak more than a couple words of English , and filmed in Italy . Eastwood apparently cut out pages of dialogue for his character ( pretty unusual , given that he was only really known from one TV show , Rawhide , and was essentially brand-new to major films ) , which had the immensely important effect of making his character more mysterious . He squints his way through the film , creating a toughness and grittiness that earned him such huge recognition . The movie is very bare bones , no extravagances , and Eastwood's character ( who really shouldn't be called The Man With No Name , but rather The Man With Three Names ) is not made into a movie superman . He makes mistakes , gets beaten up , and ultimately wins his respect and victory through smarts , not special effects . Eastwood makes an astonishingly charismatic and interesting western figure , which helped this movie to really launch his career . He plays the one independent role between the battling American and Mexican factions , an unattached rebel with no needs or cares other than to provide for himself , which allows us to relate detachedly to the two sides of good and evil without really associating with either of them . Outstanding . . .
544488	562732	389557	9.0	Smart war thriller from an international action veteran ?	OK , so anytime I hear the name Paul Verhoeven I always immediately think of Robocop , which I saw for the first time when I was about ten years old and I never quite recovered from that scene where Murphy gets all shot up by the bad guys . It was a movie moment at a formative point in my life where I really learned the extent to which people can go in doing terrible things to each other ( years later , I saw things like Texas Chainsaw and Wes Craven's Last House on the Left and The Hills Have Eyes and realized that I hadn't seen anything yet ) . Verhoeven began his American film-making career with Robocop , an enormously violent and hugely popular success , and began a career spanning nearly two decades of working on a lot of big budget Hollywood movies like Basic Instinct , Total Recall and the disappointing Hollow Man . I wouldn't expect a respectable World War II film to come from someone with such a filmography , but Black Book is sort of a return back to Verhoeven's days as a filmmaker in the Netherlands , where he had a successful career before coming to Hollywood . It's becoming more and more difficult for people to come up with unique and interesting stories involving the widespread struggles against the Nazis in WWII . I would even suggest that it's becoming safe to say that a WWII film can be made or broken solely by the performances , which are becoming more and more the most memorable things about these movies because so much of the stories are already known . In Black Book , however , Verhoeven's European film-making sensibilities mix nicely with his Hollywood experience to bring together a fascinating and even fresh , albeit fictional , story of a small group of people fighting back against the Nazis as the war slowly begins to go wrong for them . The title of the movie refers to a book that lists the names of wealthy Jews who pay handsome fees to be transported to safety , only the be killed and robbed be the Nazis . The movie takes place in Holland in 1944 . Carice von Houten plays Rachel Stein , a young Jewish singer living in hiding . She and her family come into contact with a man who claims to know a way to transport them all safely out of Nazi territory and into a neutral zone . During their night escape , however , they are gunned down and Rachel is the only survivor . She eventually joins a group of Dutch resistance fighters where she works menial jobs for a while before finally being promoted to a job of much higher importance and danger . Her task ? infiltrate the Nazi hierarchy and seduce a high-ranking officer , Ludwig Muntz and bug Nazi headquarters so the resistance can listen in on the Nazis war planning . Muntze is attracted to her and the seduction is easy , but Rachel fails to hide the fact that she's Jewish and , even worse , she ultimately falls in love with him . This all starts to sound a little cheesy , but it's actually one of the movie's strong points . I've read that the movie has been shrouded in some controversy , particularly in America , for having the audacity to portray a high - ranking Nazi official as anything other than pure evil , although I tend to doubt very much that any lack of deserved recognition that the movie found is probably a result of being filmed all in original languages . This was an artistic decision , not an economic one , and it was a smart one . Had they made the movie in English , a huge element of authenticity would have been lost . Indeed , portraying a Nazi official in a respectable light is a lofty goal but the movie pulls it off amazingly well . And the authenticity of the movie is astonishing . It has all the polish of a Jerry Bruckheimer production but none of the stupid plot devices or cheap romantic subplots generated to drive the weak story . This is a stunning story of betrayal and total sacrifice in the face of insurmountable odds and adversity , and a brilliant cast arranges themselves behind Carice von Houten , who delivers a spectacular performance as a woman forced to bury intense emotions even while she strips herself of her dignity for the benefit of her oafish enemies . The plot is too thick to explain in its entirety in a review , and it would also subtract from the fun of watching it all develop yourself . But there is real betrayal on the Nazi side and suspected betrayal on the side of the resistance that leaves Rachel and Muntze on the run from their lives , both of them fleeing from the very people that have been providing them with their safety . There is also a powerful statement on the endlessness of war as the movie shows us that the killing doesn't always stop when the radio announces a victory for either side . It reminds us that after countless thousands of years or wars , human beings are no closer to world peace now than we've ever been . Paul Verhoeven has done something noticeably different with Black Book than we have become used to seeing from him over the last few years , but he has definitely turned around a worrisome direction that his movies started taking with Showgirls and bottomed out with Hollow Man . It's nice to see that Verhoeven has gotten his magic back !
543898	562732	105690	9.0	Yes , Steven Seagal actually came out with an action movie worth watching .	Sure , Seagal played the typical role that he always plays ? a cook on a marine vessel , in this case . Evidently the job requirements to hold his position on the ship were things like advanced culinary degrees in cooking and food preparation , as well as minors in knife-throwing , martial arts , and general ass-kicking . Luckily , we find out later that he was previously a Navy Seal of some sort who was forced into the position he now holds because he was wrongly accused and prosecuted long ago , but wanted to stay with the Navy . Erika Eleniak co-stars as Jordan Tate , the dancer hired to jump out of the cake topless for the captain's birthday party . She also delivers one of the very few half-decent performances by a Playboy model ( ever see Anna Nicole Smith in any of her films ? ) . However , in Under Siege , it is Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Busey who collectively steal the show . These two guys work together nearly as well as Riggs and Murtaugh in the great Lethal Weapon series , except that now they're bad guys . It's a little bit odd now to see Tommy Lee Jones playing a bad guy , but he's such a skilled actor that he can pull it off perfectly . They also provide some of the best comic relief seen in recent years . I particularly liked the scene where Jones and Busey break into the captain's office , and Busey reads a memo written by the captain , saying that Busey may need a psychological evaluation . Keep in mind that Busey was dressed as a woman in this scene ( for reasons which you'll just have to watch the movie to find out ) , which makes it hilarious as he furiously asks Jones , ' Do I look like I need a psychological evaluation ? ! ' The story deals with a nuclear weapons heist , which is a pretty tired premise by now , but it is made entertaining by the good performances , stunts , direction , and script . The fairly brutal violence in this film is balanced by just the right amount of comic relief , which could come at seemingly any moment , such as when Rieback ( Seagal ) was locked in the meat locker and was trying to get the naïve soldier to let him out ( ' Take my pies out of the oven ! ' ) . ( spoilers ) However , the movie did contain its share of action movie clichés . There were plenty of goofy one-liners , some of which were funny , and some of which just should not have been left in the movie , such as Rieback's final line in the film ( ' Here's one move ? ' ) , which nearly ruined the movie on its own . And , of course , there could never be an action film with a big-breasted blonde like Eleniak without the hero getting the girl ( in the cheesiest way possible , in this case ) . But before you label Under Siege as " yet another Seagal film , " compare it to the mind-numbing crap that he usually comes out with . Despite tasteless things like this that were thrown carelessly into the film , Under Siege still succeeded on many more levels ( a Seagal movie worth watching ! ! ) , making it a worthwhile action film .
543918	562732	108394	9.0	Moody blues ? .	I had a hard time motivating myself to watch Bleu , which I have only ever heard glowing reviews about . People have been recommending the movie to me literally for several years , and I never got around to watching it until last night , after I recently purchased the trilogy for a whopping 30 yuan ( about $4 . 25 ) , thanks to China's total indifference to copyright laws . The movie is suitably depressing and highly artistic , and although some of the technical experiments didn't really work for me , the story itself is outstanding . Early in the movie there is a clumsy use of a flashing blue screen that might remind some Hitchcock fans of the psychological use of color in Vertigo , but it's one of the examples of the overuse of blue in the movie that came to me to be a little redundant . The movie is called Blue and it's an emotional color , I don't think we really need to be hit over the head with it so many times . Juliette Binoche stars as Julie Vignon , the wife of a famous composer who dies in a car crash , along with their daughter , throwing her entire life into total emotional chaos . She responds by trying to erase her memories of her lost past . She sells all of her possessions , moves to a new place , and goes back to her maiden name . Throughout this time , she immerses herself in her sadness , just like that astonishingly blue swimming pool . Obviously , music is an extremely important part of the film , it takes us on an entirely separate journey through Julie's sadness and emotional development . The movie illustrates her loss of feeling , her inability to form meaningful connections with other people after her catastrophic loss , and through the thoroughly unexpected turns of events that take place throughout the movie to allow her life to continue , in completely unexpected directions . There is a lot of focus on minute details in the film , long shots that focus on seemingly trivial objects but that create a surreal environment that is almost impossible to create in any other way , similar to the effect that Binoche gets with her particular style of under-acting . There are a few moments in the film when the screen fades to black for a few seconds and then fades back in to exactly the same shot . I imagine Kieslowski was going for some kind of temporary mental blackout , triggered by an emotion or a sudden painful memory , but it just came across as campy to me . Nevertheless , the movie has such a powerful and involving story that it's easy to overlook things like this , although this is certainly not the feel good movie of the year . By far the film's best feature is the story , which is brilliantly written and takes us on a fascinating journey , followed by the stupendous performances . Kieslowski is not one of our most accessible directors , but certainly one of the most enduring .
543773	562732	101775	9.0	Don't let her turn you into one of them !	Drop Dead Fred is a difficult film to review . I saw it for the first time when I was 13 years old or something , and I absolutely loved it because I was right in the middle of the age group at which the film is directed . I watched it again recently , and while the film's slapstick comedy did not hold quite the same massive appeal ( although I was still hugely entertained ) as it did when I was younger , I regretted to discover that I had grown out of a lot of the goofy antics that went on in the movie . However , I was reading through some of the reviews written on the IMDb by other users , and was amazed at how offended a couple of people were by this film , revealing in their reviews a total detachment from their own inner selves and a complete misunderstanding for the little people that we call kids . No , for example , I would NOT recommend a seven year old girl to psychiatric help for making a mess . This is arguably one of the most ludicrous ideas that I have ever read on the Internet Movie Database in my entire life , and believe me , I have read some jaw-droppingly moronic comments on this beloved site . If you read through the user comments for this movie , you can so clearly see the difference in the people who liked it and the ones who hate it that it almost makes you laugh out loud that these people can't see that they are exactly the kinds of people that the movie rebels against . Drop Dead Fred begs Elizabeth not to let her mother turn her into one of them because he doesn't want her to turn into the kind of person who is so uptight and frigid and barren that she would be incapable of enjoying exactly the kind of entertainment and fun that Drop Dead Fred is . This is a movie that was made for people who are still in touch with their inner child , people who realize that a little girl with a mother who has absolutely no understanding of the mind of a child has every right to escape into the world of an imaginary friend if it will help her escape the grayness and responsibility imposed on her by her mother , who demands absolute perfection and hasn't the first clue about how to raise a child . Very similar things can be said about various IMDb users , such as ones who refer to Fred as a product of a deranged mind or say anything about psychos or brutality or insanity . Drop Dead Fred is not a film about an insane little girl . Indeed , I like to think that the world is populated mostly with people who understand that the minds of young children operate slightly differently than their parents'and our own , and that they can be forgiven for getting into a little mischief . I am generally against grouping together people who did not like a certain film , but in this case it seems overly obvious that the people who wrote negative reviews of this fun comedy are simply the people who resent being pointed out as the kinds of people that they are . Drop Dead Fred is a movie that was made for fun , to be enjoyed , laughed at , and respected for reminding us that we need to lighten up occasionally and , while not necessarily flinging spaghetti in a nice restaurant , act like children every once in a while to prevent ourselves from being driven insane by the fast-paced society that we live in . And if you can't do that , if you hated Drop Dead Fred because you simply can't understand that concept , if , indeed , you think that Elizabeth is in dire need of psychiatric care , you may want to step back and look closely at your life and your views . YOU may be the one in need of therapy .
544491	562732	1130988	9.0	Stop The Presses ! Van Damme Is An Actor !	There's nothing worse than starting out a film review with a massive cliché like " Van Damme like we've never seen him before , " but that's exactly what happens in JCVD , his startlingly autobiographical new film in which he plays himself . With well-known movie stars ( or characters ) , one of the most interesting things that they can do is level with us so we can relate to them on a realistic level , when they approach the reality of who or what they are and we see them looking at themselves through our eyes . If this weren't true , celebrity interviews would never be interesting . In JCVD , Van Damme plays himself in his hometown . He is routinely stopped by excited fans who asks for pictures and autographs , but we also learn of a bitter legal battle in which he is losing custody of his daughter , major financial problems and the emotional effects of the downward spiral of his career . Last night I watched Steven Seagal's newest film Against the Dark , and I can tell you , it would have been a much better career move for Seagal to have made a film about his own spiraling career rather than star in another movie that is speeding up the freefall . The movie opens with a preposterously long action sequence in which Van Damme is hurtling through an elaborate action set like your typical action b-movie hero , but all of the moves are a little bit off . The timing isn't quite right , punches miss , and he's not exactly on his marks . It doesn't look well for the movie , until a set wall tumbles over and a panting Van Damme complains to the director ( a childish snob more interested in throwing darts at a picture of Hollywood than he is in the movie he is supposed to be making - this tiny character is one of the movie's only real weak spots ) that he's 47 years old and it's really hard for him to do everything in one take . He leaves the set and we follow him into some version of his real life . There is a scene where he is negotiating with his agent , and he explains that he doesn't want to work in bad movies anymore where the majority of the entire budget is taken up by his own salary . " I'll work for scale , " he says , " just get me into a studio . " We also learn of a rivalry between himself and Seagal where any excessive negotiating will just result in roles going to Seagal , who has " promised to cut off his ponytail for the first time . " One day while trying to secure legal fees , he goes to the bank and walks right into the middle of a robbery , and the robbers seize the opportunity to make it seem as though Van Damme were the criminal , leading to a tense stand-off involving the media , the entire town , and his mother . Van Damme has made a career out of being a tough guy , so it takes a particular style of bravery to make a movie about him as a real man in a situation where he is helpless to stop the violence that's taking place around him . He's not a superhuman , he's just a guy , and when he gets hit in the side of the head with a handgun it will lay him out just like anyone else . But this is a totally different tact than he has ever taken before , it's a totally different idea , in fact , than I can ever remember seeing in any movie . He has one scene that is an artsy monologue given directly to the camera that a lot of critics have complained about , but it is one of the best shots of the year , one of the most unflinchingly honest performances I've ever seen from an action movie star , and by far the single best piece of acting that Van Damme has ever done in his career . I don't know how much of this is real about Van Damme's real life , but I love the way he pokes fun at himself and his genre , particularly his relationship with Seagal . But it's important to realize that not all of this is poking fun . It is a scathingly honest admittance of the realities of Van Damme's life and the realities of the kinds of movies that he makes , and even what they all add up to . In a way , JCVD attacks not only the limitations of Van Damme's own career , but the shallowness and meaninglessness of so much of Hollywood at large . From that dart board at the beginning of the movie to Van Damme's movie-star fantasy near the very end of the film , it shows us how much more effective and meaningful real life can be than movie magic . There is a place for both , but when one is forgotten completely , something important is lost .
544023	562732	2208	10.0	D . W . Griffith revolutionizes the filmmaking industry ( an industry for filmmaking did , in fact , exist by this time ) with a simple but groundbreaking film about a girl trying to protect herself and her money .	The Girl and Her Trust , like all films made in the early 1900s , is very simple and very short , but Griffith introduces a number of filmmaking techniques that remain widely in use to this day . Earlier films generally played like a stage play , with minimal cutting or editing , and each scene taking place in the same location and generally in the same shot . The Girl and Her Trust was one of the first films to suggest that editing could create artificial environments by linking sets together , and it also gave a better idea of what exactly was going on ( the close-up of the girl as she places the bullet in the keyhole is a great example ) . Besides that , this film also had a very well-made chase at the end , in which the good guys are in a locomotive chasing the bad guys ( the guys who stole the $2000 from the girl - her ' trust ' ) who are pumping furiously on a railroad handcart . Although technically crude by today's standards , this scene had every necessary element of a good chase sequence , and it works very well . The film also introduced the idea of cross-cutting in filmmaking , as well as the idea of filming outdoors ( a technique barely and clumsily employed by Edwin Porter in The Great Train Robbery ) . The Girl and Her Trust is a historic film , but as with all films that were made in the early 1900s , you need to keep its age in mind . It's not going to blow you away with visuals or sound , but if you keep in mind the time period in which it was made , you can begin to really appreciate its innovation .
544475	562732	99088	10.0	Just as incredible as the first two , Back To The Future III provides two hours of great fun .	Doc Brown and Marty McFly are back for another time travel adventure , and once again their exploits are great to watch . The film is well-written and directed , and all of the actors involved delivered spectacular performances once again . There could not have been a sharper contrast between the last Back To The Future and this one ( we go from the neon colored future of flying cars and 3D movies to the old dirty west with its overflowing spittoons and gunfighting ) , yet the story holds together strongly and keeps the attention of the audience from start to finish . The old west was portrayed beautifully , although maybe a bit crudely and stereotypically , and the way that the town of Hill Valley was transformed for all three films is one of the biggest highlights of the series as a whole . In Back To The Future III , the challenges that face Doc and Marty are ingenius , and a solution to their problems is extremely difficult to think of , which makes it that much more fun to watch the film . Back To The Future III is an excellent way to have ended the trilogy , which as a whole is among the best trilogies ever made . What other group of movies follows the same characters through their adventures which take place in three different centuries ? Clearly , Back To The Future III deserves a lot of respect , as do the previous two films . They are all a huge amount of fun to watch , and the films can be enjoyed by people of all ages , which is a quality that few films possess . If you haven't seen these films , go out and get them , and if you have seen them , you may want to go out and watch them again .
543979	562732	365109	10.0	Astounding .	I studied marine biology for a couple years in college , and this movie has some of the most amazing underwater footage I've ever seen . It's a fascinating journey into the ocean , particularly the parts that most of us will never see , like the arctic regions and the deepest reaches of the deep ocean . Some of the shots themselves are incredible just in the way the camera crew were able to immerse themselves in the biological communities that they were filming , especially the feeding scenes . Anyone with even a passing interest in the ocean and the mysteries of life on this planet should definitely not miss this . This movie is an explanation for why so many people believe that our planet should be called Oceanus rather than Earth .
543776	562732	120324	10.0	One of the best thrillers in years .	( spoilers ) A Simple Plan , while the foundation of the plot seemed rather unoriginal , was surprisingly realistic and convincing . The overall meaning of this movie deals with the consequences of a few regular people running into a very large amount of money , especially when they have to bend the law in order to keep it . I think it also deals with the importance of obeying the law , because throughout the movie , the three guys , Hank , Doug , and Lou , seemed to be a bit like a rolling snowball as far as what they had to do to keep the money a secret . It demonstrates the startling ease with which the common man can be driven to commit unspeakable atrocities , such as shooting his own brother despite the utter absence of any direct conflict between them , just to keep his hands on a large sum of illegally obtained cash . I think that there is also an underlying theme dealing with the closeness between brothers , much like the closeness felt between sisters in other films like Hillary and Jackie . I think that the relationship of Hank and Doug , the two brothers in A Simple Plan , is much more realistic than Hillary and Jackie's . Although they do get along , they have what appeared to me to be a common occurrence of disagreements . For example , they disagreed on chasing the animal into the woods at the very beginning of the movie , as well as whether or not they should keep the money they found . The fact that neither of them were the ? beautiful people ' usually found in Hollywood films ( particularly Billy Bob Thornton's character ! ) made their roles even more convincing . I think that cinematics played an unusually important role in A Simple Plan . The very first thing that really stands out is in the very beginning of the movie . When the three men finally reached the decision to keep the money , there was a very high angle shot of the three of them , as if the camera was sitting in the trees above them , and in the foreground was a black crow . Black crows are often associated with bad luck , and just by showing this crow in the foreground the audience knows that the three men have just made a bad mistake , almost as if it was said out loud . I think that the snow was also very important to the presentation of the film . The fact that the three men were bundled up in coats pretty heavily seemed to give them a look of vulnerability . It made them look helpless against the cold , calling attention to their mortality , and thus subconsciously enhancing the suspense later in the film . Also , the snow provides a kind of a muted atmosphere . It is very overwhelming of everything so it creates a great sense of isolation for the town where the story takes place , and I think that this adds to the theme about three regular guys . I don't think this film would have been nearly as effective if it had happened to three guys in New York City . There is also a lot of foreshadowing in this film . One example is when Hank is in the sheriff's office with the sheriff and the pseudo-FBI agent . The sheriff keys into his gun cabinet , and then there is a quick cut to Hank's face as he watches where the key is placed , and then a close shot of the sheriff's hand placing the key under his memo pin on his desk . I think that by showing Hank's face looking at the key being hidden on the desk hints that he is going to try to get into the gun cabinet soon and , sure enough , he did . I also think that this knowledge adds to the suspense because the viewer knows that guns are soon going to be involved . A Simple Plan is a very original and very effective thriller that is very inviting but surprises you because it turns out to be much more intense and much more moving that you would expect . It's about ordinary people dealing with extraordinary circumstances , and the resulting message is powerful and unmistakable . The skill in this film is not only heavily present in the acting and directing , but also in the cinematography and editing departments as well . Don't miss this one .
544603	562732	295297	10.0	The Harry Potter series returns with a powerful sequel that adds to the depth of the story introduced in the original film and even throws in a few new characters , all of whom fit perfectly into the Harry Po	The second installment in what is proposed to be the seven-part Harry Potter series delivers the same intensely imaginative and visually stunning wonders of the original , and is widely considered to be much darker , literally and figuratively , than the original . It is refreshing to see that this sequel did not take the treacherous path of trying to cash in on the success of the original ( an unfortunate tendency that is occasionally successful , as in the case of Ace Ventura and Blade , but almost always results in a bitterly disappointing sequel , as was the case with sequels to Austin Powers , Men In Black , Halloween , Mission Impossible , The Exorcist , etc . ) , and the film is wisely just as faithful to the novel as the first film . I have heard and read many complaints suggesting that director Chris Columbus was not creative enough to add in his own vision to the film , changing it enough here and there to make it his , but this is completely unnecessary . Books are only adapted to film if they are at least moderately successful in their literary versions , and the more successful the book is , the less reason there should be to change anything in it . The Harry Potter novels from J . K . Rowling have been justifiably described as ' publishing phenomenons , ' in which case I can't see any reason why anything should be changed in the film version . The books have developed a tremendous fan base , and what these people want to see in a film version of the books is a cinematic experience that is as imaginative and fantastic as the one that runs through their heads as they read the novel . I read both of the first two Harry Potter novels after having seen the films , and both times was amazed at how faithful the films are to the source material , a little detail which has led to tremendously satisfying adaptation films in the past , such as The Green Mile , The Shawshank Redemption , Stand By Me , and Great Expectations , which was a great film despite the fact that it falters slightly in the last act . The Chamber of Secrets is an adaptation film that follows closely on the heels of a tremendously successful predecessor , and still manages to hold its own . The younger audience is sure to delight to no end in the way that our three heroes , Harry Potter , Ron Weasley , and Hermione Granger , take on the task of solving the mystery of the Chamber of Secrets ( I'm surprised that this was never used by Franklin Dixon ( whose real name escapes me at the moment ) as one of the titles of one of his thousands and thousands of Hardy Boys novels ) , entirely on their own . This is an adventure tale of the highest order , which pits these three pre-adolescent wizardry students against an ancient mystery that the rest of their schoolmates and even the most seasoned staff at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry are rather apprehensive about looking into . As the Harry Potter series continues , it becomes more and more apparent that J . K . Rowling had the entire series in mind when she began writing , as much of the action and the story in The Chamber of Secrets involves and expands on material from the first film . The lovable Hagrid , for example , was mysteriously expelled from Hogwarts fifty years earlier , for reasons that he never liked to discuss , and through a story told by probably the most innovative diary in fantasy / adventure movie history , Potter is taken back in time to see exactly why he was expelled , which reveals Hagrid as the prime suspect in the film's mystery and helps to keep the audience guessing until the very end . Aside from bringing back all of the original characters , the movie also sets up the third installment by giving us a detached but fairly clear introduction to the wizard prison Azkaban , in that we hear a lot about it and see Hagrid taken off to spend some time there , which only wets our appetites to see it more clearly , which is sure to happen in the third film . One of the more interesting extensions on the original story is the introduction of Draco Malfoy's equally antagonistic father , played with precision by Jason Isaacs , who adds perfectly to the rivalry between Draco and Ron ( whose families famously have remarkably opposite financial situations ) by pitting Ron's father almost head to head against Draco's father . The good vs . evil plots in the Harry Potter films have so far been just about as ultimately shallow as the ones in the Star Wars films , but as was also the case with those , The Harry Potters are so imaginative and come across as such stunning visual experiences that it makes up for the basic storytelling technique . Even more than in the first film , Harry and his friends are faced with solving a tremendous mystery without any outside help , which usually comes from the lovable Hagrid , who has unfortunately been wrongfully accused and thrown into prison , leaving them entirely on their own even among a variety of helpful professors , particularly Albus Dumbledore , who also runs into some serious hardships that it's up to our heroes to fix . The plot revolves around a mysterious creature that seems to have escaped from the Chamber of Secrets ( which does or does not exist , depending on who you ask and what they're too afraid to admit ) which is running around the school occasionally petrifying students , crimes for which Harry Potter himself is gradually blamed . The rivalry between Potter and the vicious Draco Malfoy is just as fresh and appealing as ever , with Malfoy never seeming to let go of his hatred for Potter , a hatred which he holds for good reason and which expands upon his character's personal history , as well as Potter's . The mystery escalates to a point where the entire school is on lockdown , and the very future of Hogwarts is considered doomed , even by the head masters , McGonagall and Dumbledore . Harry Potter and his friends embark on a wonderful and tense adventure in this powerful adventure film . My only complaint about the Harry Potter films so far is that the endings tend to be a little bit too clean and tidy , almost to the point of being Scooby-Doo type endings , but the adventure is so genuine and so exciting that it more than makes up for polished endings . The Harry Potter saga is off to a powerful start , and the success of the novels certainly suggests that this will continue .
544435	562732	112691	10.0	" Caught bang to rights , you were ! "	You can't really go wrong with Wallace and Gromit , and A Close Shave is no exception . The hilariously traditional Yorkshire duo are running a window-washing business that one day leads them to a wool shop run by a bizarre-looking British woman who immediately wins Wallace's heart , despite a deep sadness behind her eyes and a vicious-looking dog . It should be noted , by the way , that the makers of this short movie have succeeded in giving a claymation character deeply sad eyes . This alone might have been reason enough for why it won an Oscar for Best Animated Short Film . While Wallace follows his helplessly stolen heart , Gromit finds himself framed for a mysterious sheep-stealing and killing scheme and is thrown in prison . An adventure follows that could only exist in a Wallace and Gromit film and includes , among other things , a hilarious truck / motorcycle chase with the help of an incredibly coordinated flock of helpful sheep . Enjoy !
544453	562732	248808	10.0	Yes , yes , it's all true !	For The Birds is the side-splittingly hilarious short animated film that preceded the rather unimpressive Monsters , Inc , and all this hype that you may have read about For The Birds in the comments index here on the IMDb is pretty accurate , with the exception of the occasional grump who calls it forgettable or just amusing or some other such nonsense . Pixar is becoming more and more famous for the hilarity of their films ( especially the short ones , if only because they are virtually uniformly hilarious ) , and For The Birds is definitely no exception . What you have here is a story that is about as simple as they come - a bunch of tiny egg-shaped birds on a telephone wire who are approached by a big goofy bird , and they are all contemptuous toward her and do everything they can to get rid of her . It's the conspiracy that these little birds come up with to get rid of this ostrich-looking bird ( yes , I know it's not an ostrich , by the way ) and the fact that Pixar is able to communicate it to the audience without a single piece of dialogue other than these hilarious cheeps and grunts that the birds make that makes the film so impressive and funny and , yes , MEMORABLE . The Academy Award that For The Birds won for Best Animated Short Film for 2001 was even less of a surprise than the one that Shrek won for Best Animated feature ! It was a given ! For The Birds is not the kind of short film that you watch before a rather short animated film and serves no other purpose than to make you feel like you got your money's worth because the feature film is rather short . This is not just something to keep you in your seats for a little longer ( how much of a difference would three minutes really make in that case ? ) , this is something that Pixar throws into the mix because they're so good at what they do that they can deliver pure entertainment even with such a short film . The old Roger Rabbit short films are the kind that are mildly amusing on a more childish level and that can be forgotten rather quickly , but For The Birds is something else entirely . Like all the Pixar shorts - not the least of which is Geri's Game ( which should not be confused with Gerald's Game , which is a strikingly different story ! ) , one of my personal favorites - For The Birds is the kind of short film that you enjoy for only a few minutes but remember for years . My only hope is that Pixar will someday come out with a special DVD just for all of their short films . Bravo !
544347	562732	30341	10.0	One of the best of Hitchcock's earlier thrillers .	The Lady Vanishes is the last of a string of six thrillers that Hitchcock released in the 1930 , associating him with the thriller genre for the rest of his career . The film starts off with a panning shot of a less than convincing model of a town , portraying the avalanche that has trapped a whole train full of passengers in a remote hotel until the tracks can be cleared . We see a conglomeration of the typical types of people all thrown into the same place , eventually getting onto a train together after the audience has had a chance to get to know them and the situations that are to make up the rest of the film . Two businessmen ( you may recognize them as the ones that oddly showed up in my review of The 39 Steps ) are on the train and are entirely too concerned about a cricket match that they stand to miss if the train is delayed too much . They have been cut off from communications with London , and have been rendered virtually helpless because of it . A woman named Iris who is entirely too concerned with getting married runs into a spectacularly obnoxious musician who she can't seem to get away from from the moment she meets him . It's interesting to consider some of the messages that Hitchcock passes in this film through his traditional brand of cynical humor , such as the fact that a musician is introduced as horribly aggravating but ultimately turns out to be one of the heroes in the film , as well as such things like a man who serenades early in the film is strangled soon thereafter , as well as the fact that marriage is presented very early on as something that should only be done after everything else in life has already been done . ( spoilers ) Just before everyone boards the train in the morning , there is an important attempt on an old woman's life that results instead in the young brunette looking to get married getting hit on the head by a falling planter . This scene is important because it shows that there is someone out to get this old lady , and it also provides the excuse given to Iris ( the brunette ) later in the film as she tries to investigate the disappearance of the woman , who becomes her friend on the train . You would think that someone with such important information as this lady is carrying would not be such a social butterfly with a stranger on a train , but either way , the knock that Iris took on the head just before getting on the plane provides a perfect way to get her to believe that she imagined Froy ( the old woman ) when she disappears . One thing that I was a little bothered by during Iris's initial investigation was the fact that she never even thought to look on the window where Froy had written her name with her finger . They were going through a tunnel when they were introducing themselves , and the train became too noisy for Iris to be able to hear Froy's name , so Froy wrote it on the window with her finger . Because it would have been so much more normal to just wait a few seconds for the train to quiet down rather than writing on the windows , you would think that this little quirk of Froy's would have struck Iris as something to check for later when everyone is telling her that she imagined the old woman and that she was never there in the first place . At any rate , Iris takes a nap early in the film and wakes up to find Froy gone , and a freaky lady across from her who looks like the Bride of freaking Frankenstein says that there was never an old woman there , and the search begins . The investigation that Iris conducts in search of her friend provides the body of much of this fascinating film , and Iris's musician friend from the hotel joins her for a good portion of it , becoming the second of the two ordinary people involved in extraordinary events in this film . The two businessmen on the train ( again , you know them from my review of The 39 Steps , I watched these movies too close together ! ) provide much of the comic relief during the film as they are constantly concerned with getting back to London in time for a cricket match , despite even the most deadly conditions aboard the train , and the musician from early in the film provides a rather unwelcome partner in investigating Froy's disappearance . There are several interesting montages in this film . Editing is one of the most powerful tools that Hitchcock put to use in many of his early films , and it is used to great extent here , although not always with clear meaning . I am curious about the extensive montages that are shown of the exterior of the train as it begins moving , as well as between scenes on the moving train . But there are also montages that are very clever and very effective , such as the one in the middle of the movie in which Iris looks at all of the people sharing the cabin on the train with her and realizes that they all bear some physical resemblance to Froy , suggesting that maybe she really did imagine her as so many people have been telling her . That was , after all , a pretty nasty bump on the head . Late in the film there is the necessary addition of the blurring of the lines between the good and the bad guys . The neurologist who travels around performing miraculous brain surgery turns out to be not such a great guy , and the nun wearing suspicious high heels also turns out to be not quite as suspicious as she is initially portrayed . We are left unaware of who can be trusted and who is telling the truth , constantly questioning which side each person is on , even the musician and the two businessmen . In the shootout scene at the end of the film , we get the most tense and most amusing scene in the entire film . There is a lengthy shootout involving a shortage of ammunition and nowhere to run , during which the businessmen , who are themselves participating in the shooting , casually mention things like how they'll never make it on time for the match NOW , and when they are told what is happening , they don't believe it . They express one of the widespread public opinions that allows Hitchcock to be so successful with films about ordinary people in extraordinary situations ? ' Things like that just don't happen . ' There is also , I might mention , a curious duality in the title of the film . I read an interview of Hitchcock somewhere where he was explaining that the title refers to both the disappearance of Froy as well as the subsequent disappearance of the ' lady ' that Iris is at the start of the film and the emergence of the investigator that she becomes . This is a duality that is reflected in many other areas of the film , not the least of which is the fact that , like many other Hitchcock films , The Lady Vanishes contains an unusual but surprisingly effective juxtaposition of comedy and tension , resulting in an entertaining thriller that can make you laugh just as much as it can make you nervous .
544505	562732	21749	10.0	You can't go wrong with Charlie Chaplin , but City Lights is even better than Chaplin's films usually are .	Chaplin takes himself a little more seriously in City Lights , and the results are spectacular . The musical score which Chaplin composed for the film was one of the many highlights , and even though Charlie's performance is much more dramatic than usual in some scenes , the hilarious comedy for which he is known and loved is still abundant . City Lights is so well made that it is one of the very few movies in which the obvious flaws can be gladly overlooked . Yes , you can clearly see the string holding Chaplin up in the sidesplittingly funny boxing scene , but who cares ? That is such classic slapstick that little things like that really don't matter . Besides , let's keep in mind that this movie was made seventy years ago . Chaplin does a phenomenal job in his traditional role of the tramp , and develops a perfectly convincing romantic relationship with the blind flower girl on the sidewalk . His friendship with the drunken rich guy is hilarious , but it also makes a significant comment about the problems of alcohol . This is truly a great film , which should not be forgotten .
544649	562732	134618	10.0	Wow ! It really IS the Rocky of hockey !	Mystery , Alaska is kind of like The Mighty Ducks , except that it's intended for an older , more intelligent audience . The characterization as well as the narrative structure is much more mature , and the players , thankfully , are not little kids but people with a wide range of ages that have played hockey their entire lives as a result of having always lived in such brutally cold weather . There seems to be an underlying theme about the damaging effects of sudden fame , or even the possibility of sudden and even temporary fame , as the town of Mystery goes to great lengths to build onto their town ( particularly the pond ) , so that they will be ready when the New York Rangers arrive . The biggest strength that the Mystery team had was playing on a pond as opposed to in a rink , and building this rink in their town cancelled out that advantage , making their chances of winning against the professional Rangers much smaller . ( spoilers ) Like in Rocky , the point here is not to win the game , because they lost to the Rangers , but the Mystery team went that distance and played a good game against a professional team . They played against all odds and they held their own , and literally came within inches of winning the game against a team that had tremendous advantages against them . After that last shot bounced off of the goal , barely missing , the audience is left trying to figure out a way that the game will have to continue long enough for the home team to win , but when Burt Reynolds ( in an excellent performance as the town judge as well as the father f one of the payers ) starts clapping , it is clear that the game is over and that they have lost . However , the applause that follows , especially that that came from the Rangers , bouncing their sticks on the ice as a show of respect , indicates that they succeeded despite having lost the game . Mystery , Alaska is an excellent film that gives the sports genre a much needed boost , showing an untraditional but refreshing and very effective conclusion that seems bittersweet but leaves you cheering . Russell Crowe further proves his amazing versatility as an actor , and all others involved also performed beautifully . The location is perfectly presented , almost making the audience feel cold just because the setting is so realistic , and the team really does look like a team of small town guys who have known each other and played hockey together all of their lives . You might be able to say that Mystery , Alaska pans out a little too similar to the way that Rocky did , but this is still a great film that just makes you feel good .
544077	562732	105236	10.0	Quentin Tarantino begins his directing career with the first of several chronologically mixed , disturbingly violent , and incredibly powerful films .	Reservoir Dogs is a testament to the idea that " less is more . " This doesn't apply to the violence , the film is extremely violent from beginning to end , but the details of the botched diamond heist , which the entire film is based on , are conveyed only in the dialogue , except for one scene where Mr . Pink ( Steve Buscemi ) recalls his escape . The whole film takes place after the failed robbery is over , and the mystery that unfolds among the criminal participants is amazing to watch . This is not a normal crime film . The thing that really sets Reservoir Dogs apart from all of the others is that it is PURE . When you look at the screen , you're looking at reality . There are no Hollywood actors , there's no make-up to make them look pretty , there's little to no comic relief , and most important of all , there's no goofy romantic subplot clumsily thrown in , a detrimental trademark of so many action films , as well as virtually all Jerry Bruckheimer films . Instead of all of that garbage , Tarantino decided to just present the film as simply and straightforwardly as possible , and by doing that he makes it seem that you're really looking at a bunch of criminals trying to figure out what to do after a suspiciously failed robbery . Even though most of the actors were known at the time this film was made , the film was delivered in such a way that you don't see the actors at all , you only see the brutal characters that they portray . It is genuinely frightening to imagine being in the same room with any of them , and this is a quality that is rarely achieved in any kind of film . Make no mistake , Reservoir Dogs is among the most violent films ever made , and some scenes are really painful to watch , but the way that reality is captured is something that justifies the violent excesses in this film . The violence is never glorified , nor is the criminal lifestyle . When films are overly violent , they usually get branded as such , but despite the extreme violence , Reservoir Dogs still manages to deliver an important overall message about the consequences of your actions . It remains high on the growing list of Tarantino's classic films , and it will not be soon forgotten .
544533	562732	180093	10.0	Do not watch while under the influence of ANYTHING .	SPOILERSDrugs , alcohol , painkillers , don't even watch this if you've taken ASPIRIN within the last 24 hours . Requiem For A Dream is extremely moving and powerful and REAL and it could only bring out the worst of any type of mind-altering substance . I watched this film stone sober and in the middle of the night , and when it was over I was almost afraid that the sun wasn't going to come up in the morning . This is one of the most powerful anti-drug movies to have been released in years . And the thing that really sets this film apart is that it is not a crash course in all of the bad side effects of drugs . There are numerous characters in several different storylines that all converge and deliver a unique message . This is one of the things that made movies like American Beauty so good , there is just so much going on . The film is a spiraling downfall for all of the characters involved , but it manages to have an unusually strong impact because of its realism , which is ironic because one of the film's strong points is its striking use of editing . There is a constant use of creative and disorienting editing and cinematography , which gives the film a feeling of being a little off at all times , but it manages to remain realistic enough not to lose any impact . As far as editing , I was particularly impressed with the creative use of the split screen . The film starts off with a scene in which Harry ( Jared Leto ) borrows his mother's television set , and she is so upset that she locks herself in the other room . In the split screen , we see Harry from two different angles , and on one side , we see broken shots , while the other side shows continuous action . This is done with multiple cameras , so it's not the sheer difficulty that I noticed as much as the creativeness . And of course , being a drug film , it is full of interesting and sometimes disturbing editing and cinematography . Jared Leto is excellent as Harry Goldfarb , a junkie who wants to sell enough drugs to really support himself , his girlfriend , his partner in trafficking ( Tyrone ) , and most importantly , his mother . The relationship between Harry and his mother Sarah is the one from which the majority of the emotion in the film is derived , as well as from his girlfriend Marion's descent into drug-induced prostitution . Ellen Burstyn is stunningly effective as Sarah Goldfarb , Harry's mother , who lives exactly the existence that you spend your entire youth hoping to never have to live . She is alone , she's overweight and unattractive , and she's so obsessed with getting onto a stupid TV show just one time that she goes on such an intense crash diet that she literally drives herself insane . The antagonistic refrigerator , by the way , is one of the more interesting things about the film , and should also be noted for its originality . What was the last respectable film you saw in which an inanimate object like a refrigerator was made to have such a successfully menacing presence ? Jennifer Connelly has changed dramatically from the cute actress that we saw in older movies like Labyrinth and Career Opportunities and The Rocketeer . In Requiem For A Dream , she delivers a spectacular performance , proving her skill as an actor . But it is the performance from Marlon Wayans that is by far the most surprising and noteworthy . He plays the part of Tyrone with such amazing skill that it is almost impossible to believe that this is the same idiot that we saw in the god-awful Scary Movies . Way to go , Marlon , but stick with the movies that can be enjoyed by people with more than one brain cell in operation , like Requiem For A Dream . ( spoilers ) Another thing that this movie does on more than one occasion is give an example of How People Get Like That . Every time I see or hear about a homeless person or a mental patient ( which is not often , I admit ) or a woman so strung out on drugs that she would sell her body to get her fix , I always wonder what must have happened in that person's life for them to have wound up like that . Requiem For A Dream provides a perfectly plausible story in which a nice but rather pathetic woman becomes obsessed with her chance to appear on television and winds up getting electro-shock therapy against her will in a mental hospital , and then we see that Marion winds up engaging in lesbian shows for crowds of drunken jerk-offs , and Harry shoots up so much in the same arm that he has to have it amputated . These are the kinds of things that make you wonder how they got like that , and in this movie we see how it happened and its believable . Requiem for a Dream is not one of the most cheery movies I've ever seen , in fact , it is downright disturbing at many points , but it is powerful and effective and should be noted for that . The film is photographed and edited in creative and interesting ways , which not only makes it fascinating to watch but also enhances the drug element of the film , which was also a technique used with huge success in the must more well known film Traffic . There is a lot of difficult to watch material in this movie , but it is a very well thought out film . Not for the weak of heart , but this is an excellent piece of cinematography .
544432	562732	468569	10.0	" How about a magic trick ? "	It's been a long time since I've been wildly excited about going to see a new movie in the theaters . I normally wait until the crowds die down , and see the big movies at least a week or two after they are released , if I don't just wait for the DVD . But the previews and reviews of The Dark Knight were so uniformly excellent that I was counting the days , and I was definitely not disappointed . I have heard speculation that a lot of the positive reviews are based in no small part out of respect for Heath Ledger's tragic and untimely death , but now that I've seen the movie I know that that is most certainly not the case . His performance as The Joker is one of the most consistently outstanding film performances I've ever seen . Brilliant ! ! I've never been a huge fan of Ledger's , although I find his performances usually pretty good . But I've rarely seen an actor do something as brilliant as what he did for this movie . As for Christian Bale , I'll watch him do anything ( you probably saw the preview before this movie for Terminator Salvation , and in my opinion , it's Bale that is the savior of that franchise , as he is of Batman ) . This is one of out most enormously talented and wonderful actors , and he fills the role of Batman perfectly . What I love the most about the movie , however , is not about the performances or the special effects or even the action , but the way it delves so deeply into the psychology of all of the main characters . There is an astonishing amount of introspection given into the minds of The Joker , Batman , Two-Face , and others , and this psychological analyses give insight into the minds of the characters and gives reasons for their actions . Or , in the case of The Joker , the absence of reasons for their actions ( " I just . . . DO things . . . " ) . In a lesser film , the villain explaining that there are no real reasons behind his actions , like there are for normal people , that he is just basically flailing wildly and there is no explanation for his villainousness , would come off as weak screen writing , a weak excuse to present an evil character with no moral boundaries . But The Joker is written and performed so well that , when he gives this explanation , you almost want to cheer for him . His brutal honesty counteracts his evil tendencies and makes him enormously watchable . Like Mickey and Mallory , writers Christopher and Jonathan Nolan ( also responsible for the purely brilliant Memento ) understand that a good villain must have plenty of public appeal . All of the previous Batman films have dealt pretty simply with the hero Batman trying to save Gotham City from the evil villains , and this is changed completely in The Dark Knight . The citizens of Gotham are calling for Batman's unmasking , the revelation of his identity , and for him to face the consequences of laws that he has broken and other problems that he has caused , such as being a vigilante and even causing the deaths of police officers . There is a major identity struggle as Wayne watches in dismay the news reports of public masses calling for him to show himself , as The Joker has vowed to kill people every day that Batman keeps himself hidden . Wayne's options get slimmer and slimmer . Seemingly in an attempt to undermine everything that Batman has come to represent , The Joker concocts brilliant schemes which force Batman to make a decision between two choices , each of which forces him to make a terrible ethical or moral mistake . He is forced to choose someone at the expense of another , to do something he would never normally do , each time lengthening his rap sheet , so to speak . You may begin to notice that , as in real life , when he starts doing these terrible things because he has no choice , his guilt is written in stone . No one cares that he was forced into anything , or that he made the best possible choice he could . The goal , of course , is to humiliate Batman and destroy his public image , and it's a little frightening how easy that is . The transformation that the characters undergo is hugely unexpected , and it is not at all disheartening that the movie ends with virtually the promise of more sequels . I personally expect to see again Commissioner Gordon ( Gary Oldman ) , Lucius Fox ( Morgan Freeman ) , Two-Face , Gordon's son ( that little blonde kid that Two-Face almost killed ) , and probably Salvatore Maroni . He has a relatively small role , but it's interesting that Batman dropped him off a building and shattered both of his legs , and then he was walking around again a few scenes later . He's gotta have powers of some kind . It's not often that a movie comes along with this much hype and expectation and speculation , and not only lives up to the hype , but surpasses it . I have noticed that The Dark Knight has unseated both The Godfather and The Shawshank Redemption and has taken the # 1 spot on the IMDb's Top 250 list . This is the first time in the ten years I've been using the IMDb that I have ever seen any movie other than those two at # 1 or # 2 , and the movie definitely deserves it . Christopher Nolan's second Batman film has not only elevated the Batman franchise , but it has both elevated and broadened the entire sub-genre of the comic book movie . While so many extra sequels these days come off as another movie tacked on to a successful franchise just to cash in on the popularity ( Hear that , Jones ? ) , the Nolan brothers have taken us deeper into the story and completely changed the direction . I am eagerly waiting to see what comes next !
544240	562732	82971	10.0	Even the MPAA ratings board loved it ?	I bring up the ratings board because , like the two films that followed it , Raiders of the Lost Ark seems to have been granted almost unprecedented leniency in the rating . People get shot , stabbed , poisoned , murdered , blended up by airplane propellers , a head explodes , another head has the skin melted off of it like candle wax , there are corpses and all manner of other horrible things , and yet the movie gets a PG rating . I watched Raiders of the Lost Ark , The Temple of Doom and The Last Crusade one after the other yesterday , and early on found myself wondering what it was about The Last Crusade that earned it a PG-13 rating when both movies before it were shockingly violent and bloody for PG films . Our introduction to Indiana Jones is much like most of the time that we spend with him , a nonstop roller coaster ride of adventure , where one thrilling situation leads right into the next . He is sort of what every kid fantasizes that adult life is really like , a constant adventure punctuated only by the times when he has to teach class , pretending to be a normal working adult and hiding the fact that he's a world-traveler who constantly risks life and limb in order to get precious artifacts into museums where they belong . This is the kind of thing that makes you want to be an archaeologist . The movies all take us to exotic locations and immerse us completely in thrilling adventure , as Jones gets himself into one dangerous situation after another in search of ancient historical artifacts . It's surprising that it wasn't until the third film that he goes after the Holy Grail , but each film starts off with scenes of adventure that rival even the best opening action sequences from any of the James Bond films . The Ark of the Covenant represents everything that Jones got into archeology for in the first place , as he mentions early in the film , and he has to race against time in order to obtain it before it falls into the hands of the Nazis . The film displays exactly the right amount of comic relief to counteract the viciousness of Jones ' pursuers who , as we know , are not above torturing and killing in order to get what they want . The characters in the movie are wonderful , with Karen Allen portraying Marion Ravenwood , Jones ' ex-girlfriend who ends up his partner on his quest for the Ark and , my favorite , John Rhys-Davies as another helper along the way . Some of the best scenes in the movie involve Rhys-Davies when they're all in the desert , at the site in which the Ark supposedly rests . Speaking of the best scenes , some of them are not the ones that take place when Jones first arrives in Nepal . The fight scenes that take place when he and Marion get separated in the marketplace are heavily over-rehearsed and completely unconvincing , but I'm still willing to accept them because the scene as a whole is so much fun . The scene where Jones casually shoots the swordsman in front of the crowd has been one of my favorite scenes in the movie since I was a kid , although when I watched it yesterday I noticed that every single extra in the scene reacts wrongly except for a single person . One person immediately turns and runs terrified into the crowd away from the shooting , while everyone else throws their hands into the air and dances around as though they're celebrating . I hope someone found that one extra and offered sufficient congratulations . The movie is set against the backdrop of Nazi Germany under the control of Hitler , who wants the Ark recovered for himself at all costs , so it's Indiana Jones and his two partners trying to recover the Ark and survive the onslaught of all of Germany's military might . The movie is put together in the same manner as the old Saturday adventure serials , this time with bigger adventure and more danger . ( spoilers for all three films ahead ! ) What I especially respect about the movies is that they avoid going too far . It's a difficult line that they walk , too , because you can't have a movie like this that delves too deep into the meaning and existence of a lot of the things that Jones searches for without risking failure . Many adventure films seek certain things that , if they are shown , will immediately look fake ( like the aliens in Mission to Mars ) , and if they're not shown they risk failure by giving the feeling of leading the audience on without payoff at the end . All three ( thus far ) Indiana Jones films ultimately end up with Jones ' failure to obtain the artifacts that he is seeking , but he has still been successful in his missions . It's not an easy thing to accomplish in any story , but these movies are more concerned with the thrill of the chase and the knowledge of when success has truly been achieved rather than getting too close to the objects at hand . Bravo .
543797	562732	78748	10.0	Whose idea was it to bring a cat in the first place ?	I'm a little confused as to why there was a cat on board in the first place . Needless to say , given that there was an entire crew on board the Nostromo , a merchant vessel carrying , if I remember correctly , something like 20 , 000 , 000 tons of mineral ore , there was hardly a lack of companionship . At any rate , I can easily brush aside my curiosity about the effort that went into designing the life support system that would have been needed to keep the cat alive along with the rest of the humans as they traveled for months on end in deep sleep . It doesn't matter , because the cat was involved in most of the scariest scenes . That being said , I think that one of the things that really makes Alien great is that it explains all the twists and turns of its plot in great detail , which is almost unheard of in science fiction and horror films . No one displays ludicrous behavior to allow for the construction of bloody , gory death scenes , the alien , masterfully designed , isn't rushing across the screen in every scene to allow for maximum payoff of the costume design , we don't even see it until well past the halfway point in the movie . Like Jaws , Alien takes its time to allow the characters to gradually grasp the enormity of their situation . The Nostromo is a merchant ship , which allows for a non-military crew to be faced with a mortal enemy that they do not understand . The ship intercepts a strange transmission that must be from an intelligent source since it repeats itself every twelve seconds , and so it wakes up the crew to investigate . The subtlety of the way the conflict is introduced is very important . The transmission didn't just appear , the ship awoke the crew months ahead of schedule , because it was programmed to do so should anything like that happen . And to the chagrin of a couple of the money financial-minded crew members , it is also in their contracts to investigate any such occurrence . The movie is covering its tracks very thoroughly and to great effect . When they reach the planet from which the transmission originated , they find the spectacular discovery of what appears to be a crashed alien spaceship , complete with a dead alien pilot still in his chair . A brief look at the body suggests that the pilot may have exploded from the inside , creating curiosity about his death that the movie never satisfies but doesn't need to . One of the crew members discovers what look like dozens of leathery eggs , gets attacked , and is brought back on board the ship . Significantly , protocol is broken to get him and the alien life form back on board for medical attention . When they discover that the alien has blood that melts through the hull of the ship like thermite , a new and particularly difficult challenge arises . How do they kill a deadly enemy without making it bleed ? And to make matters worse , the very ship is programmed to work against them . They are in the most hostile environment imaginable , worse than anywhere on earth . They are being stalked by an unknown creature that they can't injure for fear of damaging the hull of the spaceship , and the ship itself has placed the survival of the alien life form above their own survival . They have to trick the alien into submission without letting the ship know what's going on . Even HAL wasn't THIS creepy . Released at a time when science fiction was probably at the most popular that it had ever been ( and possibly ever will be ) thanks to the recent release of Star Wars and the soon to follow first sequel , Alien came along and capitalized in an area of science fiction that people evidently were very eager for , the darker , more sinister and dangerous side . The side of science fiction with the bloody deaths rather than light sabers and heroes . In fact , by looking at the way people probably saw Alien in 1979 and the way they see it now , you can learn a lot about how science fiction and horror have evolved over the years . Back then , this was horror / science fiction . Today , it's science fiction / horror . But while it was more horrible in 1979 than it is today , it is significant that , while other films that have come along over the years have overshadowed Alien as far as the intensity of the horror , the movie has lost none of its powerful effect . Rather than reinventing the science fiction genre by adding horror to it , it is now maintaining the life of the science fiction genre by reminding us of how good it can be when it's done right .
544664	562732	92005	10.0	One of the best adaptations of a Stephen King story ever .	Stand By Me is yet another one of the stories made into a movie from the author who has had more stories made into movies than any other author in history , Stephen King . Clearly , the central character here is Gordie Lachance , from whose point of view the story is told and who obviously symbolizes King himself , given many of his characteristics as well as some of the content of the film . This movie is literally filled with actors who have achieved varying degrees of success over the years , such as Jerry O'Connell , who played Vern , River Phoenix , who could have been bigger than Leonardo DiCaprio if he hadn't died , Corey Feldman , who has grown into an unenviable but visible existence , Kiefer Sutherland , who has become an excellent and very well known actor , John Cusack can be seen in a small role as Gordie's late brother , and of course , Richard Dreyfuss , who played the narrator and Gordie as an adult , has remained famous but originally achieved fame more than a decade before Stand By Me was filmed or the original story was even written . Stand By Me takes place in the summer of 1959 , the general time period that Stephen King is most skilled at presenting , and four friends set out to find the body of a kid who was killed by a train , hoping to find what they predicted would be astronomical fame . Unfortunately , the town's bullies are also out to find the body for the same reason , which leads to the films ultimate final climax . Even though this is a very clever story with which to tell a fall from innocence story , it is the brilliant characterization and the incredible acting that really make this a classic film . It is extremely rare that a film comes along that stars young kids and is so moving and powerful . Also , every one of those kids is made three dimensional in creative and smooth ways , making you feel like you really knew them by the end of the film . Vern is the fat kid who always gets picked on , Teddy and Chris both have abusive or deranged fathers , not to mention Chris's cruel brother , and Gordie is a young boy who lost his brother three months earlier in a violent accident and who has been largely ignored by his parents ever since . In one memorable scene , Gordie wonders how Teddy can be so enthusiastic about his father's alleged military achievements when the man once held his head to a stove , nearly burning his ear off . Gordie is mystified because he could care less about his own father , who hadn't laid a hand on him since he was three years old and got caught ' eating bleach under the sink . ' Stephen King pokes fun at his own craft many times in the film , such as in Gordie's vehement line , ' Fck writing . I don't want to be a writer , it's a stupid waste of time ! ' Not only that , but there are also obvious references to his other works , such as when the boys first realize that no one brought food , and Teddy says , ' This is great , what are we supposed to do , eat our feet ? ' People who actually read instead of just lazily watching the movies will recognize this as a major part of the plot of another of King's short stories , ' Survivor Type , ' from which Cast Away borrowed heavily . And why don't you people read these books ? ' The Body , ' which Stand By Me was based on , is only 148 pages long , you could read that in a couple of hours and the experience is totally different from a movie . It's even more disturbing that ' The Body ' was published in the same book ( Different Seasons ) as a couple of King's other famous stories ? ' Apt Pupil ' and , of course , ' Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption . ' Stand By Me is a story of how one event can unexpectedly change lives . It seems to be a story about friends and how important they are , but this possible theme is clearly dispelled in a line from the narration spoken at the end of the film ? ' As time went on , we saw less and less of Teddy and Vern , until eventually they became just two more faces in the halls . It happens sometimes , friends come in and out of your life like busboys at a restaurant . ' Instead , the film is about learning from a life changing experience and actually making changes or modifying your life in some way because of it , and this is heavily emphasized at the end of the film . Stand By Me is a timeless film . Stephen King's story is skillfully brought to the screen under the direction of Rob Reiner , and the 1950s are brought back to life just as successfully as King so often does in his stories and novels , with the slicked back hair , the hot rods , and in the film , and excellent 50s soundtrack . There is so much more to this film than just the superficial story ? things about the characters and the story , but also about the tremendously talented man who wrote it all .
543923	562732	783233	10.0	Brilliant .	It took me a long time to get interested in watching Atonement , even after it was so well received at the Oscars . Recently I watched the first 20 minutes or so and was immediately put off by the atmosphere and the characters ( " I've been going completely doolally up here ! " ) , for exactly the same reason that I am generally put off by books like The Great Gatsby or Faulkner's The Sun Also Rises , which feature characters of such wealth that their biggest problem seems to be what to do with all their surplus money and leisure time . Such people are difficult for me to relate to . For a couple weeks I put the movie aside and couldn't get up the interest to watch it , until finally I did and now I realize why it was one of the best pictures of 2007 . Keira Knightly , a clearly talented actor who , for some reason , almost never impresses me , plays the daughter from a wealthy family living in the beautiful English countryside just before World War II , and James MacEvoy plays the daughter of a man working for her family . He is a promising and educated young man , but the son of a housekeeper nonetheless , so clearly a romantic relationship between the two would be highly taboo . The first 30 minutes or so of the movie depict a life devoid of trouble or worries , and yet still manages to create an atmosphere of slight tension about the war that we can almost feel approaching somewhere beyond the edge of the screen . Before long , Cecilia's ( Knightly ) 13 - year-old sister sees a couple of things happening and makes some dangerous assumptions followed by some increasingly dangerous accusations , and radically alters the lives of her sister , Robbie ( MacEvoy ) , and herself . The three main characters , from this point on , have remarkably little control over their own lives , reminding me of the struggles of the main character in Kubrick's brilliant film Barry Lyndon . The unusually structure of the film allows us to explore the results of a few catastrophic days in the lives of these three people and how they affected the rest of their lives . The film covers the course of many decades , tells a stunning and moving story , and never once comes off as pretentious or cheesy or preachy , even in the closing scene , which shows Briony , Cecilia's sister , as an aged novelist giving an interview about how that one decision during her childhood has affected her life . This is a story about life and how we affect those around us , particularly those closest to us , even when we think we're doing the best thing for them . One IMDb reviewer calls it " pure poetry on film , " and it's not easy to think of a more accurate description . Note : There is a scene in the film where Robbie comes across a horribly grisly scene in the woods during his military service . The following close-up of his face is one of the best pieces of acting I have seen in many years . . .
544061	562732	7264	10.0	" The amorous waiter of the rink ? "	The Rink , one of Chaplin's most charming early short comedies , starts out with the little tramp working as a waiter , and there is a hilarious short scene where a customer calls him over for his check , and Charlie comes over and writes up the bill based on the food that the guy has spilled all over himself . It seems to me that this was the film that inspired parts of Modern Times , especially the skating and the kitchen scenes . There are some wonderful uses of the IN and OUT doors leading to the kitchen , which do not seem repetitive even after I've seen Modern Times five or six times . One of the most charming scenes in the whole movie is a short piece where Charlie goes behind the bar to mix someone a drink ( shaken , not stirred ? ) . It's one of the famous scenes from Chaplin's early career . When Charlie gets off work , he changes back into his famous outfit and heads out to the bus stop . While he is sitting on the bench next to a woman , he pulls off some truly vintage Chaplin behavior that is so spontaneous and so well acted that it makes me think of Chaplin just goofing off in real life . This is what I imagine he was really like a lot of the time . With The Rink , it is easy to see that longer , and more genuine stories are slowly evolving in his early films . It is not a deep story by a long shot , and there is still plenty of high-action physical slapstick comedy , but there is much more here than at most of his previous films . But most of all , the feature skit of the film is the skating scenes in the second half , which are outstanding . It's amazing to me how good Chaplin was on skates , and some of the skits he pulls off here ( such as the bouncing up and down on the fat woman ) are truly brilliant pieces of slapstick . I have to say that I wish I knew where exactly the film's closing shot was filmed , since it's an outdoor shot and I am always curious to know what parts of Los Angeles are being shown . Excellent show !
544155	562732	117381	10.0	This is an absolutely amazing film . However , it is also tragically underrated .	Primal Fear is one the best films that I have seen in years . Richard Gere portrays a glamorous attorney handling a case that has horrified the public and which seems to be a slam-dunk . He seems to be the only person who believes that young Aaron Stampler did not murder Archbishop Richard Rushman , a grisly crime which is tastefully portrayed at the beginning of the film . Edward Norton , in particular , was startlingly convincing as Stampler . This was really his chance to let the world know what a phenomenal actor he was and still is . Unfortunately , this film did not get the recognition that it deserved , which may have been a reason why Norton's next film , American History X , was also not as big as it should have been . Edward Norton was about 98 % of the reason to watch both of these films , which were both absolutely amazing and intense . Primal Fear is a film that can be enjoyed by pretty much anyone . The story is so well-told and well-acted that it holds your attention firmly and does not even begin to let go for all 130 minutes . It easily achieves the level of intensity that is desired by all mysteries and thrillers , with an ending that is both shocking and disturbing . Primal Fear is destined to become a classic , regardless of how relatively unknown it may be . This can be said about an extremely small number of films , but no matter what kind of movie you enjoy , if you haven't seen Primal Fear , go out and find it . You will not be disappointed .
544278	562732	86567	10.0	A classic computer film that has stood the test of time remarkably well , considering the fact that it's a computer thriller .	Wargames is one of those young adult films that manages to span just about all ages of movie fans with its sense of adventure mixed with a chilling sense of reality . Kind of like The Goonies , it is a movie that finds a young kid in an extraordinary situation , except that rather than the Indiana Jones type adventure that the Goonies go on , David ( a young Matthew Broderick ) has inadvertently come frighteningly close to starting a massive nuclear war between the United States and Russia . We meet David early in the film after a tense missile launch training sequence ( in which the men on hand do not realize that they are only participating in a training drill ) . David is a typical high school boy , bored to death by school but fascinated to no end by computers , even the now-prehistoric dinosaur that he had operating at home . One of the things that I liked about this movie , in fact , was that it made my computer look so high tech ! Obviously , any movie that deals with computers is going to be outdated in a few years , and Wargames is certainly no exception . Consider , for example , the fact that David's girlfriend was so fascinated by the concept of a speaker that she picked it up and looked at it from all angles , completely amazed . You can see this in any number of movies , such as the similarly ancient computers in Weird Science and , probably the most amusing , the massive , brick-sized cellular telephone that Wesley Snipes used in true gangster style in New Jack City . Technology is an amusing thing , especially when it's taken so seriously in the movies and then is so completely obsolete a decade or so later . Wargames , however , despite being jam-packed with outdated machinery and computer technology , is no less potent as a military thriller , because the technology is not the point of the film . Instead , the movie tells the story of how David goes searching for video games on the 1983 version of the Internet , only to accidentally stumble upon a top-secret military database , WOPR ( endearingly referred to as ' Whopper ' ) that runs hypothetical sequences of what World War III would look like , including how the Russians would react to American reactions to their actions , and so forth . The process by which this machine can do this is one of the few things that's left relatively unclear in the movie , which is probably a good thing , because it sounds suspiciously like something that a computer even today would have a hard time doing . Imagine the staggering amount of information that would have to be entered into a computer for it to achieve that level of intelligence . At any rate , wanting nothing but some new video games and to impress a girl , David searches for video games on what appears to be the web's only search engine ( and , indeed , it's only feature at all ) , and stumbles onto such titles as Backgammon , Chess , Guerrilla Warfare and , of course , Global Thermonuclear War . Naturally , being a high school kid , he's fascinated and wants to play the biggest baddest one . Probably the most hair-raising scene in the film is when David's mother calls him downstairs and congratulates him on passing his classes ( which he had changed by hacking into the school's computer system ) , by which he is thrilled until he turns to look at the TV , where the news is reporting the war that has been set in motion because of his tinkering on the computer . Wargames requires a substantial suspension of disbelief because of such things like the United States military's inability to tell whether or not those blips coming from Russia on their screens are real weapons of mass destruction of if they're just a computer game , but the fact that the world is tottering so lightly on the edge of Global Thermonuclear War , even if only because of the very presence of these types of weapons , is the frightening concept that the movie tries to get across . It focuses on the possibility that something like that could have happened , and it rings chillingly true to this day , no matter how much more advanced our technology is . Sure , it's not likely that the governments of the United States and of Russia or any other countries are likely to launch weapons that will kill millions of people simply based on a few lights that have lighted up on their switchboard , but the weapons are there , and someone paid a lot of money for them . Wargames is an enormously entertaining thriller that poses a question about humanity , with the answer from WOPR that , like Tic Tac Toe , there is no winning move in war . We see it playing through World War III on the military intelligence screens near the end of the film ( during which it evidently has a field day messing with the lighting in the room ) showing missiles coming from every direction and destroying everything on the map . ' This is a strange game , ' it says . ' The only winning move is not to play . How about a nice game of chess ? '
544872	562732	163988	10.0	This is vintage Martin Scorsese in the tradition of the great Taxi Driver . Not easy to swallow , but sure to be loved by film fans .	Nicholas Cage plays an ambulance medic who develops a wide variety of personal problems as a result of a feeling of incompetence at his job , which is , of course , to save peoples ' lives . He begins to feel a personal connection to the people that die on him , whether or not it is a fault of his . This happens especially with murders , suicides , overdoses , etc . , whom he believes become spirits who are ' half-born , ' because life was taken so fast that they did not have time to develop fully . There are so many things about Bringing Out The Dead that all come together to make it such a huge accomplishment that it would be difficult to mention them all at once . This film is literally packed with messages about religion , about hope , about personal desperation and about lust and love . Not only are these things skillfully presented , but they are also weighed against each other , so that the course of the film takes us through a journey that is very subtle and thought provoking . Nicholas Cage stars as the burned-out and alcoholic ambulance driver , and he is amazingly made up to play the part , with the ghostly pale skin , the dark eyes , the constantly messy and greasy hair , and always seeming to be slightly out of breath and perspiring . Despite this sickly look that he had throughout the film , he still maintained his tradition sarcastic humor that he has come to be known and loved for ( ' Tom , where are the band-aids ? This is an AMBULANCE , isn't it ? ! ' ' This is the worst suicide attempt I've ever seen . Feel that pulse ? THAT'S where you cut ! ) ' . His interactions with his various ( and excellently acted ) partners in the ambulance show his view of the world from different angles as numerous points of views are presented . Ving Rhames presents the religious perspective , John Goodman presents the career-ladder climber , and Tom Sizemore is as effective as ever as the hyperactive guy who doesn't really care , he just wants to see some blood ( ' Someone's gonna kill themselves , I don't want to miss it ! ' ) . Some of the scenes may have been a little overdone , for example , I think there was probably an excess of blood in the ambulance after Noel , one of the many regulars at the hospital , had a run-in with Tom Walls ( Sizemore ) after having ' attempted ' suicide . However , think of what Scorsese was trying to portray in this film . As in Taxi Driver , Bringing Out The Dead presents a darkly disturbing and dangerous underbelly of the big city ( and not just New York , where the film took place ) . Nicholas Cage's Frank Pierce had numerous similarities with Robert DeNiro's Travis Bickle ( from Taxi Driver ) , but there were many more differences , which are important for this movie to avoid being branded as a ? re-make ' of sorts . For just one of many examples , Bickle was angry at the world , couldn't sleep , and wanted to drive that taxi as much as his boss would let him . On the other hand , Frank is personally troubled by the goings on at his job , has developed an alcohol ( as well as numerous other drugs available to him from his own ambulance ) problem as well as a seemingly unhealthy interest in the daughter of one of his barely alive patients , and he desperately wants out of the job . Frank Pierce is searching for redemption . He once lost a girl named Rose , because he was unable to revive her , and he sees her face virtually everywhere he looks . It seems that he subconsciously feels that if he can help Mary ( Patricia Arquette ) get through the loss of her father , then it will be like he was able to go back and help Rose . This is exactly what Malcolm Crowe ( Bruce Willis ) was trying to do with Cole in The Sixth Sense . He wanted to help Cole so that it would be like he helped Vincent Grey , a previous patient that he was unable to help and that he ultimately lost . Bringing Out The Dead is an absolutely brilliant film , but it is definitely not for all tastes . Anyone who does not have at least a basic understanding of Martin Scorsese's work will not understand it at all and will therefore not like it . But if you understand what Scorsese tries to do in his films and if you understand the media of film itself , then this is definitely a must-see . There are anomalies that really make you think ( like that white horse that was casually strolling through the streets of a terrible neighborhood while Frank and Tom were on a suicide call ) , there are fascinating uses of the color red ( playing Red Red Wine while Frank walks through an apartment on a call in which everything is red ? the curtains , the walls , the Christmas lights , the blood ) , and the way the story is presented is very unique and perfectly chosen for the kind of film that this is . Also listen for Martin Scorsese himself as the male ambulance dispatcher . Excellent and skillful direction , great acting from everyone involved , and the virtual perfection of nearly every technical aspect of the film ( the photography , make-up , lighting , high-speed camera-work , music , dialogue , everything ) all work together beautifully to make up a disturbing but thought provoking and generally great film to add to Scorsese's growing list of contemporary classics .
543772	562732	268126	10.0	Finally a movie with a tagline that has some meaning .	Adaptation has a rather lengthy tagline , but the thing that I like about it is that , with the exception of the last six words , it is a tagline that summarizes the movie rather than advertises it . This is a rare film that is about its own creation and all of the adaptation that goes on in the lives of the people involved . Nicholas Cage takes on one of the smartest and most complex roles he's ever done , playing the parts of Charlie Kaufman and his fictional twin brother Donald , both of whom are screenwriters with polarly opposite ways of living ( or not living ) life and dealing with the world . Meryl Streep plays the part of Susan Orlean , the author of the novel ' The Orchid Thief , ' which Charlie is desperately trying to adapt into a worthy film version , the hugely talented Chris Cooper takes on the toothless role of John Laroche , a man who is strangely proficient at adapting to the slings and arrows of the world around him , yet not quite that great at getting anywhere in life . He lives a rather run-down life , but escapes criticism for it because he seems so content with his situation . My favorite story here is the one dealing with Charlie and his twin brother Donald . Charlie is an introverted screenwriter who is incapable of approaching the writer of the novel that he is adapting , and he is so determined to create a great film out of a book that he enormously admires ( and is enormously confused by ) , that it nearly drives him insane . His brother , on the other hand , takes some quick , cheap screenwriting class at some adult night school just to learn the absolute basics of screenwriting , and he throws together a huge hit , based on an idea that Charlie gave him as a joke . I saw Adaptation the same day that I saw National Security , About Schmidt , and Catch Me If You Can , and National Security was playing on the biggest screen . This is a travesty of modern society and the commerciality of today's cinema . THAT is what this part of Adaptation was about , and it's a message for audiences , because we are the ones responsible for the abysmal decline of the quality of modern movies . The reason that we are flogged with ridiculous movies like National Security and American Pie and Scary Movie and Big Momma's House and Donald's ' The 3 ' is because we buy the tickets . If George Lucas filmed an old washing machine spin-cycling itself across an old wooden floor , lit only by a single naked light bulb , and he called it Episode III , people would buy tickets by the millions , it would make tons of money , and then it would become a trend seen in movies to follow . Granted , that's not going to happen , but that is what Adaptation is trying to say . The people who write good movie scripts get yelled at by the lecturers of cheap screenwriting classes , and they go insane trying to get their intelligent movies seen by the public , who are not always as intelligent or receptive to intelligence as is often assumed during the screenwriting process . ( spoilers ) The part of John Laroche also parallels this descent into barbarism that the movie points out , as it presents Laroche as a man who has suffered a lot of bad situations and circumstances in life , but who adapts to what comes his way and gets along by whatever means are available and wherever the money happens to be at any certain time . He is at one point collecting beautiful orchids , which happens to be illegal except that he's collecting them for Indians , who have rights because of their traditional heritage , and because he never touches them . Sure , it turns out that the Indians use them for drug purposes , but he later turns to online employment , creating a pornographic website and amazing himself at how much money he brings in regardless of how terrible the content may be . Both of these professions are not the most respectable , but they illustrate a transition from nature to technology and from hallucinogens extracted from flowers to technology and pornography . This is an unmistakable step downward for society , because John represents a lower class of people who are intermingling with a higher class , such as authors of intellectual novels ( such as Susan Orlean , with whom Laroche has a twisted sexual affair ) and the screenwriters who adapt them into films . We live in a melting pot society , and it is up to everyone from the top of the social scale ( however you may personally define it ) to the bottom to prevent ourselves from reversing the process of evolution . Adaptation is not an easy movie to understand . It has a lot of strange twists and it looks back at itself across the barrier between a movie and it's own creation , intertwining a lot of different storylines and even ending in a climax that seems to belong in an entirely different movie , if not even an entirely different genre . But the film has an important message to deliver , not just about what kinds of movies people watch and the results of these ticket sales , but also about the overall state of American society and the ways that some people are forced to live in it . I can certainly understand a lot of people being put off by this film , it's not easy to follow , not easy to understand at many points , and not easy to swallow , but it is surely worth the effort to recognize what it's trying to say .
544235	562732	389869	10.0	If I sing a song will you sing along ?	This is the first time I've seen any performance footage of the Blue Man Group , who I previously knew only from having seen them in commercials several years ago . They are such an entertaining act that they don't even need very innovative or even very good quality music , and yet the songs that they write are fantastic . They poke fun at themselves in this concert , with a big booming voice echoing through the concert hall between songs , giving instructions on how to become rock stars . On the other hand , it's a great illustration of the differences between themselves and conventional rock stars , a surprising number of which seem to have followed the instructions to the letter . Some of the instructions the Blue Men are clearly mystified by , such as the rotating your hips to the techno music section , but others they adhere to with hilarious closeness , such as the " Alter your appearance to make you stand out from the crowd . " They have this characteristic way of looking at each other , as though they're not sure what's going on , and it is a great effect when they do it here , as though just realizing that they look different than all of the people watching them . Another of the many highlights of this concert is the section where they pay homage to all of the other rock stars that came before them , again following instructions given by the booming voice . The crowd cheers in delight as they recognize some earlier hits such as a song by one-hit-wonders Devo ( the majority of whose music is almost painful to listen to ) , and Crazy Train by Black Sabbath . The Blue Men react in hilarious fright when Ozzy's voice bursts from the speakers . The DVD also features a couple of music videos of songs which also appear in the concert , but the videos are great to watch on their own as well . There is an outstanding song called Sing Along that should certainly not be missed , since it is sung by Dave Matthews ( who does not appear in the concert ) . It is a beautiful song , and the Blue Men perform it with their characteristic mixture of humor and incredible musical skill , banging on huge octopus-looking structures of PVC pipes and vacuum cleaner hoses strung about their bodies like grotesque backpacks , pouring from them an astonishing composure of sound . I also love the effect of the guy with the whip . There is also a video of the song that the Blue Men did for Terminator 3 , although it is much less impressive than the other two music videos that appear on the DVD because Bush's Gavin Rossdale has too much of a heavy presence in it . It is his music video , the Blue Men simply make appearances , which is why it comes off as a more traditional and less interesting video , although the third video , Exhibit 13 , is incredibly simple , beautiful , and an exhibition of pure artistic skill . At the time of this writing something like 13 people have rated this concert DVD on the IMDb , and I like to think that it's just because not many people go to the IMDb to look up information about concert DVDs as much as to get information and write reviews and whatnot of more traditional movies . Whatever the case , I certainly hope that more people will make an effort to see this DVD and other work by the Blue Men , because they are certainly one of the most talented acts working today . Their unique and fascinating performance makes even the best rock acts seem to fuse together with the rest of the traditional performance world , even to the point of blandness . If you get the chance to see them in concert ( which I haven't ) , don't miss it because it is sure to be a concert experience unlike any other .

I have read that he lost nearly 70 pounds for the role , which is an astonishing amount of weight and supposedly the most that any actor has deliberately lost for any role in a movie in film history . His appearance is frightening in itself , with his protruding bones and sunken eyes , he inhabits the role of a man struggling with severe insomnia and an increasing array of other problems . He has a job as a machinist and it is not pleasant work . It's repetitive and dark and boring , and he tends not to get along with his colleagues so well . He seems a little out of place , even a little confused by his surroundings , and becomes increasingly distracted by various strange occurrences . I love that Bale's character's name is Trevor Reznik , named after Trent Reznor , the singer of Nine Inch Nails , one of my favorite bands . I hear that they were sought after to do the soundtrack but they decided not to go in that direction with the movie . It's too bad , too , because Nine Inch Nails could not possibly do anything bad to a movie like this . There is an intense scene in the film where Trevor is giving a ' hand ' to a co-worker named Miller , when he gets distracted and bumps into a power button , activating a machine which then won't stop , and Miller loses an arm at the elbow . It's a grisly , painful scene to watch , and it is a major turning point in the movie and Trevor ' life . Later , Miller is able to make feeble attempts to joke about the accident , apparently trying to make some light of the subject while at the same time barely covering his mixture of anger at Trevor's catastrophic carelessness and shock at how quickly his body and his life were forever changed . Trevor , on the other hand , is tremendously upset at the accident , and becomes increasingly irrational and angry as time goes on , as he tries to figure out what happened . There is a man named Ivan who works with Trevor , and for a variety of reasons they get to know each other . Ivan once suffered an injury at the workplace and lost some fingers , which were then replaced with some of his toes , resulting in one of the most grotesque things you may ever have seen organically attached to a human hand . It is truly disgusting . Things start to get weird for Trevor when he discovers that he is the only person who knows of any Ivan that works there . The idea of a character getting to know someone and then discovering that that person doesn't really exist is nothing new , but here it prevents us from having any idea where the movie is going . I think it's safe to assume that a lot of what is happening is happening in Trevor's head , but more importantly , it is a fascinating trip through the moody blue atmosphere of Trevor's sleep-deprived mind . For a temporary escape from his lifeless life , he looks to Stevie , a prostitute who gives him much more than sex , she gives him an understanding that he can't seem to get anywhere else . Jennifer Jason Leigh is surprisingly effective in this role , and she is able to very clearly portray Stevie's understanding of Trevor , as well as the emergence of their mutual need that goes far beyond just being physical . If there are any slow points in the movie , they are easily glossed over by the interest generated by Trevor's deteriorating condition . Something terrible has happened to him in the past , or continues happening , and the movie shows us his own efforts to figure it out , put everything back in order , and finally get some sleep . The end of the movie will disappoint some viewers , but like so many other great films , it doesn't tie everything up in a nice little bow . It leaves you thinking , and demands a second viewing . Note : According to the IMDb trivia page for the movie , Scott Kosar wrote the screenplay for this movie right out of film school , which would mean that , when he wrote the script for the 2003 Texas Chainsaw remake the year before , he was still a student . This may provide some reason for why that movie was so astonishingly bad . Director Brad Anderson , on the other hand , also wrote and directed a brilliant horror film a few years ago called Session 9 , which I also highly recommend ?
